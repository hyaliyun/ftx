His father was trained as a medical missionary for the Free Church of Scotland, but at that time was minister of St Mark's Free Church on Argyle Street. His mother, Hugh's second wife, was Catherine Maria (née Anderson). In 1872, the family moved to London when his father obtained a post as minister of the Belgrave Church. They moved to 20 Bassett Road in Notting Hill, a large three-storey and basement townhouse, in 1879.Ewing, William Annals of the Free Church; H. S. Paterson Education and career He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating Doctor of Medicine (MD). He later became senior surgeon at the National Temperance Hospital, honorary surgeon to the King Edward VII Hospital for Officers and Hunterian Professor of Surgery at the Royal College of Surgeons of England. During the First World War, he was honorary surgeon-in-charge of the Queen Alexandra’s Hospital for Officers in Highgate, for which he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in January 1920. He was a champion of nurses and served as medical honorary secretary of the Royal British Nurses' Association. Personal life In 1901, Paterson married Tempé Langrish Faber, daughter of the politician George Henry Faber. They had no children and his will therefore left a large sum to Trinity College, Cambridge, which was used to fund the Paterson Medal for promising medical students.

It also stores complementary information such as experimental procedures, details of sequence assembly and other metadata related to sequencing projects. The archive is composed of three main databases: the Sequence Read Archive, the Trace Archive and the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database (also known as EMBL-bank). The ENA is produced and maintained by the European Bioinformatics Institute and is a member of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) along with the DNA Data Bank of Japan and GenBank. The ENA has grown out of the EMBL Data Library which was released in 1982 as the first internationally supported resource for nucleotide sequence data. As of early 2012, the ENA and other INSDC member databases each contained complete genomes of 5,682 organisms and sequence data for almost 700,000. Moreover, the volume of data is increasing exponentially with a doubling time of approximately 10 months. History The European Nucleotide Archive originated from separate databases, the earliest of which was the EMBL Data Library, established in October 1980 at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), Heidelberg. The first release of this database was made in April 1982 and contained a total of 568 separate entries consisting of around 500,000 base pairs. In 1984, referring to the EMBL Data Library, Kneale and Kennard remarked that \\"it was clear some years ago that a large computerized database of sequences would be essential for research in Molecular Biology\\". Nucleotide sequence data in book form. Despite the primary distribution method at the time being via magnetic tape, by 1987, the EMBL Data Library was being used by an estimated 10,000 scientists internationally. The same year, the EMBL File Server was introduced to serve database records over BITNET, EARN and the early Internet. In May 1988 the journal Nucleic Acids Research introduced a policy stating that \\"manuscripts submitted to [Nucleic Acids Research] and containing or discussing sequence data must be accompanied by evidence that the data have been deposited with the EMBL Data Library.\\" The EBI at the Wellcome Trust Genome Campus in Hinxton, UK which hosts the European Nucleotide Archive. During the 1990s the EMBL Data Library was renamed the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database and was formally relocated to the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) from Heidelberg. In 2003, the Nucleotide Sequence Database was extended with the addition of the Sequence Version Archive (SVA), which maintains records of all current and previous entries in the database. A year later in June 2004, limits on the maximum sequence length for each record (then 350 kilobases) were removed, allowing entire genome sequences to be stored as a single database entry. Following the uptake of Sanger sequencing, the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (then known as The Sanger Centre) had begun cataloguing sequence reads along with quality information in a database called The Trace Archive. The Trace Archive grew substantially with the commercialisation of high-throughput parallel sequencing technologies by companies such as Roche and Illumina. In 2008, the EBI combined the Trace Archive, EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database (now also known as EMBL-Bank) and a newly developed Sequence (or Short) Read Archive (SRA) to make up the ENA, aimed at providing a comprehensive nucleotide sequence archive. As a member of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration, the ENA exchanges data submissions each day with both the DNA Data Bank of Japan and GenBank. EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database The EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database (EMBL-Bank) has increased in size from around 600 entries in 1982 to over 2.5×108 by December 2012. The EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database (also known as EMBL-Bank) is the section of the ENA which contains high-level genome assembly details, as well as assembled sequences and their functional annotation. EMBL-Bank is contributed to by direct submission from genome consortia and smaller research groups as well as by the retrieval of sequence data associated with patent applications. As of release 114 (December 2012), the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database contains approximately 5×1011 nucleotides with an uncompressed filesize of 1.6 terabytes. =Data classes= The EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database supports a variety of data derived from different sources including, but not limited to: *Expressed sequence tags with their associated sample data. *Nucleotide sequence being generated from whole genome sequencing projects at varying stages of assembly, including complete contigs and annotated, fully assembled sequence. *Data relating to transcriptomics, such as complementary DNA, with optional annotation. *Novel or extended annotations of existing coding sequences, for example new sequence versions with corrected start or stop codons. =EMBL-Bank format= The EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database uses a flat file plaintext format to represent and store data which is typically referred to as EMBL-Bank format. EMBL-Bank format uses a different syntax to the records in DDBJ and GenBank, though each format uses certain standardised nomenclature, such as taxonomies as defined by the NCBI Taxon database. Each line of an EMBL-format file beings with a two-letter code, such as \`AC\` to label the accession number and \`KW\` for a list of keywords relevant to the record; each record ends with \`//\`. Sequence Read Archive thumbleft240pxThe SRA has grown rapidly since 2008. As of 2011, most SRA sequence data was produced by Illumina's Genome Analyzer. The ENA operates an instance of the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), an archival repository of sequence reads and analyses which are intended for public release. Originally called the Short Read Archive, the name was changed in anticipation of future sequencing technologies being able to produce longer sequence reads. Currently, the archive accepts sequence reads generated by next-generation sequencing platforms such as the Illumina Genome Analyzer and ABI SOLiD as well as some corresponding analyses and alignments. The SRA operates under the guidance of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) and is the fastest-growing repository in the ENA. In 2010 the Sequence Read Archive made up approximately 95% of the base pair data available through the ENA, encompassing over 500,000,000,000 sequence reads made up of over 60 trillion (6×1013) base pairs. Almost half of this data was deposited in relation to the 1000 Genomes Project wherein the researchers published their sequence data to the SRA in real-time. In total, as of September 2010, 65% of the Sequence Read Archive was human genomic sequence, with another 16% relating to human metagenome sequence reads. The preferred data format for files submitted to the SRA is the BAM format, which is capable of storing both aligned and unaligned reads. Internally the SRA relies on the NCBI SRA Toolkit, used at all three INSDC member databases, to provide flexible data compression, API access and conversion to other formats such as FASTQ. Data access web interface, showing an HTML record. The data contained in the ENA can be accessed manually or programmatically via REST URL through the ENA browser. Initially limited to the Sequence Read Archive, the ENA browser now also provides access to the Trace Archive and EMBL-Bank, allowing file retrieval in a range of formats including XML, HTML, FASTA and FASTQ. Individual records can be accessed using their accession numbers and other text queries are enabled through the EB-eye search engine. Additionally, sequence similarity-based searches implemented using De Bruijn graphs offer another method of retrieving records from the ENA. The ENA is accessible via the EBI SOAP and REST APIs, which also offer access to other databases hosted at the EBI, such as Ensembl and InterPro. Storage The European Nucleotide Archive handles large volumes of data which pose a significant storage challenge. As of 2012, the ENA's storage requirements continue to grow exponentially, with a doubling time of approximately 10 months. To manage this increase, the ENA selectively discards less-valuable sequencing platform data and implements advanced compression strategies. The CRAM reference-based compression toolkit was developed to help reduce ENA storage requirements. Funding Currently the ENA is funded jointly by the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, the European Commission and the Wellcome Trust. The emerging ELIXIR framework, coordinated by EBI director Janet Thornton, aims to secure a sustainable European funding infrastructure to support the continued availability of life science databases such as the ENA.

Rivkin (born December 6, 1960) is Senior Vice President and General Counsel of United Airlines. Until February 2019, he was Deputy Mayor of the City of Chicago, focusing his efforts on economic development, job creation and retention, and infrastructure. For a year prior to his appointment, he practiced law at Riley Safer Holmes & Cancila LLP, advising clients on aviation, rail, road and other transportation issues, internal investigations, white collar criminal defense, domestic and international business regulation, and commercial litigation. Prior to that, he served as the Senior Vice President for Regulatory and International Affairs and Deputy General Counsel of Delta Air Lines. Prior to joining Delta in April 2013, he was the 21st General Counsel of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT). Appointed by President Barack Obama, Rivkin was sworn in on May 18, 2009, following unanimous confirmation by the United States Senate. While serving as DOT's chief legal officer, Rivkin played a key role in a number of programs and initiatives including the Cash for Clunkers program and the Toyota vehicle recalls. Career =Early work= Rivkin, a lawyer, has worked in private practice and public service. He has served as a director of the Chicago-based Metropolitan Planning Council and of the Illinois Chamber of Commerce. He was also an Assistant United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, Director of Programs and Policies for the City of Chicago Law Department, and a partner at a Chicago-based law firm. In 2001, Rivkin joined the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) as General Counsel, overseeing the legal operations of the second largest mass transit system in the country. Rivkin was \\"instrumental\\" in acquiring $530 million to expand the CTA Brown Line, which was facing a 10% increase in ridership. The project was the costliest CTA expansion ever at the time. In 2004, Rivkin left the CTA to join then- Chicago-based Aon Corporation as Vice President and Deputy General Counsel. He stayed in that position until 2009. =Department of Transportation= Appointed by President Barack Obama, Rivkin was sworn in as the 21st General Counsel of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) on May 18, 2009, following unanimous confirmation by the United States Senate. A longtime Obama supporter and contributor, Rivkin first met Obama in 1991. While with DOT, Rivkin was counsel to Secretary Ray LaHood and served as DOT's Chief Legal Officer, with authority to resolve all legal questions concerning the Department's policies and programs and its over 55,000 employees and $78 billion budget. In 2009, Rivkin was put in charge of the \\"Cash for Clunkers\\" automotive rebate program, a $3 billion U.S. federal scrappage program intended to provide economic incentives to U.S. residents to purchase a new, more fuel-efficient vehicle when trading in a less fuel-efficient vehicle. The program was promoted as providing economic stimulus by boosting car sales, while putting safer, cleaner, and more fuel-efficient vehicles on the road. The department was given an unusually short period of time to plan and develop the program.http://www.dot.gov/affairs/2009/dot11009.htm Under Rivkin's leadership, DOT issued new traveler protection rules requiring airlines to let customers off planes stuck on the tarmac for three hours. Critics of the rule have argued that it has resulted in \\"more delays and more flight cancellations\\". The rules also increased compensation for involuntarily delayed (or \\"bumped\\") passengers, required airlines to advertise their full fares, including any mandatory taxes, fees, or airline charges, and expanded the new tarmac regulations to cover international flights.http://republicans.transportation.house.gov/Media/file/TestimonyAviation/2010-07-14-Rivkin.pdf Rivkin noted that \\"[hidden fees] serve only to confuse or deceive consumers regarding the true full price of the ticket and to make price comparisons difficult.\\"http://testimony.ost.dot.gov/test/pasttest/10test/rivkin1.htm Spirit Airlines, Allegiant Air, and Southwest Airlines filed a lawsuit against the rule in November 2011, arguing that it violated their First Amendment right to freedom of speech and that the overtaxing of the airline industry is to blame for rising airline costs. Rivkin responded that \\"deceptive presentations that highlight a low 'base fare' (such as the $9 fares advertised by Spirit that include neither government taxes nor Spirit's own non-optional fees) mislead and confuse consumers, Spirit would be free to add the statement 'fares include $XX.XX in taxes and government fees' in all its fare advertising, provided it did so in a nondeceptive manner.\\" The District of Columbia Court of Appeals rejected Spirit's challenge. Rivkin also led the department's legal team negotiating a record fine for the violations that led to Toyota's recall of approximately 9 million vehicles because of unintended acceleration. Rivkin received the Secretary's Gold Medal Award for Outstanding Achievement in both 2010 and 2011. =Delta Air Lines and United Airlines= On April 9, 2013, it was announced that Rivkin would leave the Department of Transportation to become the Senior Vice President for Regulatory and International Affairs and Deputy General Counsel for Delta Air Lines, where he was responsible for addressing governmental regulation and oversight in the U.S. and abroad, as well as litigation, antitrust, employment and real estate legal issues. He also worked with Delta colleagues and industry associations to advocate Delta's interests across a range of domestic and international areas including bilateral aviation agreements, energy, emissions, competition and consumer rights. In March 2019, Rivkin became Senior Vice President and General Counsel for United Airlines. He is responsible for all legal matters, as well as ethics, compliance, government contracting, and security.

Life Gotō Masanori, commonly called Teizō, was born in 1749 in Iyo now Matsuyama, and married into the Kurita family at the age of 17. The Kurita and Gotō family both owned prosperous sake brewery, they served Katō Kiyomasa, who built Matsuyama Castle. Chodō became the 7th owner of the brewery when he was 23. Around this time, under the encouragement of his wife and his father-in-law who were haiku poet, he began to compose his haiku. For his pen name, he took “Cho (樗). In Japan, Choboku (樗木) is commonly known as a useless tree. This is his expression of his determination to give up fame and wealth.Ikeuchi, Keigo. Haiku Poets in Iyo, from Edo to Meiji. Iyo no Haijintachi; Edo kara Meiji e. Matsuyama: Ehime Cultural Foundation, 2005. Besides his successful brewery owner and haiku poet career, Chodō performed an important role in the Matsuyama Clan. He was respected by many people. Even after that, he continued to make haiku and became the central figure of Haiku society in Iyo. He built Kōshin-an in 1800 to devote himself to haiku activities, and retired from governmental service. Kobayashi Issa, one of the greatest haiku poets of their period, was an important friend of Kurita Chodō. Issa was younger than Chodō by fourteen years, and Chodō gave him guidance about haiku. Issa visited his house in 1795 and 1796 and they enjoyed composing haiku together. Their friendship lasted until Chodō’s death.Matsui Shinobu. GCM Kōshin-an Club, ed. Introduction to Kōshin-an.

He is considered one of the most important figures of avanspettacolo, vaudeville and revue. He was noted for his numerous caricature sketches, and was the \\"inventor of a revolutionary and anticonformist way of performing\\". Petrolini is also remembered for having created the Dadaist character Fortunello. His contribution to the history of Italian theater is now widely acknowledged, especially with regard to his influence on 20th century comedy. His iconic character Gastone became a byword in Italian for a certain type of stagey snob. His satirical caricature of the Roman Emperor Nero (created in 1917 and later the subject of a 1930 film) was widely perceived as a parody of Benito Mussolini, although it may itself have influenced the mannerisms of the Fascist dictator. Early years Born in Rome on 13 January 1884, Petrolini was the fourth of six children of a blacksmith from Ronciglione and grandson of a carpenter. He had a difficult relationship with father, who was a strict moralist, but was close to his mother, who supported him both emotionally and financially when he decided to embrace a performing career. He attended theaters in Rome as a boy, improvising for fun. His first performances were in the sideshows on Piazza Guglielmo Pepe. At the age of 13, Petrolini attended reform school as he bitterly recalls in his memoirs. When 15, he decided to leave home to pursue a career in the theater. In 1900, he participated in a show at the \\"Pietro Cossa Theater\\" on the Trastevere.Calcagni, Andrea. Enciclopedia dei Loris-Petrolini, Roma, Fermenti Editrice, 2011, page 200 Later, he performed in small, provincial theaters and in some cafés chantants with the stage name Ettore Loris. Career In 1903, Petrolini began performing in Rome at variety theaters and café-chantants, where he provided parodies of renowned nineteenth-century actors, silent movie and opera divas, rhetorical addresses, and even of the variety theater itself. In the same year, when aged 19, he met Ines Colapietro, who became both his professional and personal companion for many years, as well as the mother of his two children.Calò, p. 59 Ines, who was at the time only 15 years old, was hired as a singer by the Gambrinus theater in Rome, along with her sister Tina. Ettore and Ines formed the comic duo Loris-Petrolini, performing together until the summer of 1911.Calcagni, p. 58 In May 1907 in Genoa, Ettore and Ines were invited by the impresario Charles Séguin to tour South America.Calò, p.79 They performed in theaters and cafes in Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil, enjoying great success everywhere and becoming a household name in the capitals. While Petrolini was in Rio de Janeiro, appendicitis forced him to leave the stage for a month. After an emergency operation and a period of convalescence, his comeback was triumphant, with many theatrical artists giving up their pay in his favor. In a single evening, Petrolini once earned four thousand lire. After Rio, Petrolini remained a few months longer in South America. He returned for other tours in 1909 and 1911-1912, also appearing in Mexico and Cuba. Back from a successful tour in South America, Petrolini was hired in 1910 by Giuseppe Jovinelli for his theater in Piazza Guglielmo Pepe that had opened in 1909 with a performance by Raffaele Viviani. It was a great success and, after two seasons at the Teatro Jovinelli, the \\"Sala Umberto\\" company signed an exclusive three-year contract with him. In 1915, he formed his stage company, the Compagnia dei grandi spettacoli di varietà Petrolini, with whom he staged the revue Zero minus zero, that led to the debut of one of Petrolini's most famous characters, Fortunello, which was based upon a cartoon character. The performance aroused the enthusiasm of Futurists such as Filippo Tommaso Marinetti who called Fortunello \\"the most difficult to analyze of all Petrolini's masterpieces.\\" Petrolini was so flattered by the admiration of the Futurists that he participated in some of their public events performing texts of Marinetti, Bruno Corra and Emilio Settimelli. The collaboration culminated in Radioscopia di un duetto (\\"Radioscopy of a duet\\"), a one-act play co- written with the Futurist writer and painter Francesco Cangiullo in 1918. The following year, Mario Bonnard directed a film based on the play, Mentre il pubblico ride (\\"While the audience laughs\\"), starring Petrolini (in his film debut) and Niny Dinelli. Petrolini developed an anti-Dannunzian position, something which was appreciated by the Futurists, and thus he put on exhibit during his variety sketches. Il Medico per forza (1931) From the 1920s, Petrolini's repertoire was enriched with a series of plays by Italian authors such as Alfredo Testoni, Renato Simoni, Roberto Bracco, Luigi Antonelli, Ugo Ojetti, Salvatore Gotta, , adapted by Petrolini himself. In 1925, he took his stage adaptation of Luigi Pirandello's Lumie di Sicilia, called Agro de limone. In the 1920s, he also met Elma Criner, who became his companion and later his wife. In 1930, with the advent of sound films, Petrolini returned to the cinema as a protagonist of Nerone by Alessandro Blasetti, and also featuring Criner in the part of Poppea. The film featured some of Petrolini's most famous interpretations: Gastone, Nerone, Pulcinella. The same year he starred in Cortile by Carlo Campogalliani, based on the play of the same name by . Cortile was released the following year in a double bill with Il Medico per forza, Campogalliania and Petronelli's spoof version of Molière's farce Le Médecin malgré lui. In Scenario's July 1934 issue, Petrolini has 94 close-ups, in a variety of poses, expressions, and emotional interpretations. In addition to films, he continued to make many short versions of stage plays. Petrolini's work as a playwright became richer and more complex over the years: from the first macchiette (i.e. comic musical monologues caricaturing stock characters), to the successful one-act plays Amori de notte and Romani de Roma to the late comedies such as Gastone, Il padiglione delle meraviglie, Benedetto fra le donne (\\"Blessed among women\\"), and Chicchignola. In these last two works, Petrolinian drama reached its peak, as irreverence gave way to more mature depictions, both bitter and compassionate, of human weakness. Now famous, Petrolini left Italy for a series of tours abroad, first to Cairo and the Italian colonies of Tripolitania and Cyrenaica, and then, in 1934, to London, Berlin, and Paris. In Paris, he obtained what he considered the highest honor: an invitation to stage Il medico per forza at the Comédie Française, the temple of Molière. He also performed in London at the Little Theatre, in Berlin at the Kurfürstendamm Theater, and in Vienna at the Komödie Theater, where his burlesque impression of Hamlet was considered hilarious. =Imitation and parody= Petrolini is considered one of the most influential figures in Italian avanspettacolo, vaudeville and revue. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, he was the \\"inventor of a revolutionary and anticonformist way of performing\\". He was famous for his many caricature sketches, and he developed a repertoire of caricatural characters of proven success, as in Oh Margherita!, a parody portrayal of Faust (1907). His characters included Giggi er bullo (a parody of the leading character in a play by Gastone Monaldi) and Sor Capanna (a cantastorie inspired by Pietro Capanna, whom Petrolini called \\"my master\\"Bragaglia, Anton Giulio: Storia del Teatro popolare Romano, Roma, Colombo, 1958, p. 426. ). Petrolini wrote: \\"Imitation is not art because if it were there would be art even in monkeys and parrots. The art is to deform.\\" A characteristic of his art was the continuous reworking of the characters he created, giving them the profile and texture of real comedy characters. This was the case of Gastone, the subject of a skit titled \\"Il bell'Arturo\\" in the 1915 revue Venite a sentire, subsequently performed on several occasions and developed into a tragicomedy, Gastone, in 1924. Gastone was both a parody of the stars of the declining world of silent films and of singers of the time, such as Gino Franzi, with their repertory of dramatic songs lamenting sad farewells and unrequited loves. Another character that started as a skit – \\"l'Antico romano\\" – was Nerone, who developed as a parody both of imperial political rhetoric and of the emphatic declamatory style of the \\"great actors\\" of the day. =Songs= Music played a key role in Petrolini's theatrical style and is an important ingredient in many of his comedies. Many of his characters sing songs and ditties (filastrocche), or declaim verses to a musical accompaniment. Petrolini was often an interpreter, and sometimes also the author, of popular songs of the day, many of which were released as records. One of the biggest hits of 1926 was Una gita a li castelli – also known as Nanni – written by Franco Silvestri and performed (and arranged) by Petrolini. His most famous song, originally recorded in 1932, with music by Alberto Simeoni, is undoubtedly Tanto pe' cantà, which evokes an uncomplicated vision of life. The song quickly came to symbolize a way of life that was felt to be characteristically Roman – it was later recorded by many well known Roman artists, such as Alvaro Amici, Gigi Proietti, Gabriella Ferri and, most prominently perhaps, Nino Manfredi, who had a major commercial success with it. Personal life Petrolini's tomb in Campo Verano, rebuilt after the original was hit in an air raid In 1923, Petrolini was initiated into Freemasonry. Petrolini's sympathies for, and impertinences towards, the Fascist regime were complex. Petrolini was admired and befriended by Mussolini, even though his Nerone caricature was widely perceived as a parody of the dictator. As noted by the critic Oreste Del Buono, the Nerone characterfirst created by Petrolini in 1917may actually have influenced Mussolini's own mannerisms. Although a public supporter of the regime, Petrolini did not refrain from satire, including a famously disrespectful rejoinder after Mussolini had presented him with a medal. Forced to quit the stage in 1935 following a severe attack of angina pectoris, he died aged 52, in Rome, on 29 June 1936. The corpse, dressed in a tailcoat of his celebrated character Gastone, was buried at the Cemetery of Verano. On 19 July 1943, during the first bombing of Rome, his tomba rectangular chapelwas hit, breaking the marble bust and severely damaging the coffin containing the remains of the actor. The renovated tomb bears the epitaph \\"Dalla bocca tua cantò l'anima di Roma\\" (\\"The soul of Rome sang from your mouth\\"). Legacy Alberto Sordi interpreting Gastone in the film of the same name (1960) inspired by Petrolini's original creation Petrolini influenced future generations of Italian comic actors, including Alberto Sordi, Carlo Verdone and Gigi Proietti. His Gastone became a byword in Italian for a certain type of artistic snob and ladies man (and later for a man kissed by fortune, after the Donald Duck character Gladstone Gander was rendered in Italian as \\"Gastone Paperone\\"). In 1960, a film version of Gastone was released, starring Alberto Sordi. The film was directed by Sordi's old friend Mario Bonnard, the man who is thought to have provided the original inspiration for Petrolini's iconic character.

The game was published by Devolver Digital and released on 23 October 2012 for Microsoft Windows. Set in 1989 Miami, the game revolves primarily around an unnamed silent protagonist—dubbed \\"Jacket\\" by fans—who has been receiving coded messages on his answering machine instructing him to commit massacres against the local Russian mafia. The game blends top-down perspective with stealth, extreme violence and surreal storytelling, along with a soundtrack and visuals inspired by 1980s culture. The game itself was influenced in part by Nicolas Winding Refn's 2011 neo-noir crime film Drive, as well as the 2006 documentary Cocaine Cowboys. At release, the game received critical acclaim, with praise regarding its narrative, themes, music and gameplay. Hotline Miami has since become a cult video game. A sequel, Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number, was released on 10 March 2015.  Gameplay  Hotline Miami is divided into several chapters, each of which is further broken down into several stages. At the start of most chapters, \\"Jacket\\" wakes up in his apartment and listens to cryptic messages on his answering machine. These messages tell him to perform an arbitrary task at a certain location, which in each case is inferred as a euphemism for killing every person at that location (e.g., \\"giving VIPs at a hotel a great stay\\" or \\"taking care of a pest infestation\\"). Prior to commencing a mission, the player is asked to select an animal mask to wear, each of which—with the exception of \\"Richard\\", the default rooster mask—provides a unique benefit, such as faster movement or a starting weapon. In each stage, the player navigates a building from a top-down perspective, where the goal is almost always to kill every opponent therein. Occasionally, they must also defeat a boss at the end of the chapter or find key items as they explore. Some levels also include hidden animal masks for the player to find along the way, often in the bodies of other killers who failed the assignment now being undertaken by \\"Jacket\\". By default, the player starts each assignment unarmed, just outside the target location. Most enemies carry a wide variety of melee and ranged weapons which can be collected both from their bodies and the environment. Far outnumbered, the player must rely on their increased awareness (being able to see inside every room within a large radius) and either stealth, overwhelming force or a combination of both to overcome challenges. However, because the player character is no more resilient than enemies, mistakes are often instantly fatal. Despite the game's high lethality, attacks such as punches, weapon throws and door slams merely knock enemies down, prompting the player to gruesomely execute them on the ground. In addition to the more common white suit-wearing mobsters, the player is later pitched against guard dogs, police officers and other opponents that require different strategies to defeat. Enemy artificial intelligence varies slightly, causing them to occasionally move unpredictably and making it difficult to plan a perfect approach. To make up for this, Hotline Miami allows the player to restart each stage as soon as they die, allowing them to quickly fine-tune their approach over several attempts. At the end of each chapter, the game grades the player's performance based on factors such a speed, variation and recklessness, with high scores unlocking new weapons and additional masks.  Synopsis  = Plot = Hotline Miami takes place in 1989 Miami, where the player takes the role of an unnamed man dubbed \\"Jacket\\" by fans for his distinctive letterman jacket. One day, he receives an answering machine message about a supposed delivery of \\"cookies\\" to his home. Jacket finds a package outside containing a rooster mask and instructions to perform a hit on the Russian mafia and steal a briefcase in their possession, threatening that he is being watched and that \\"failure is not an option.\\" After Jacket completes this mission, he receives further messages on his answering machine, each asking him to take care of an innocuous \\"problem\\" at a specific address; these locations invariably contain a criminal operation, usually run by the Russian mob, that he must eliminate. Throughout the game, Jacket has visions where he is confronted over his actions by three masked figures: the cryptic rooster-masked Richard, the hostile owl-masked Rasmus, and the sympathetic horse-masked Don Juan. The personality of the masked figures is seen by who wears them. The owl, Rasmus, is being worn by a member of the Russian mafia. The horse, Don Juan, is worn by a girl that Jacket saves later in the game. The chicken, Richard, is worn by the player, Jacket. During a raid on the estate of a movie producer, Jacket rescues a woman and brings her home, nursing her back to health and later, building up a relationship with her. In another mission, Jacket is called to a phone company where he finds everyone dead except for a lone biker, whom he fights and subsequently kills. Jacket finds other animal-masked killers dead (or dying) during some of his assignments; after most of them, he visits a store or restaurant where the same bearded clerk greets him. \\"Beard\\", as he is dubbed by fans, gives Jacket encouragement and free samples of merchandise. Jacket's perception of reality becomes increasingly surreal, as he begins to see the talking corpses of his victims during his everyday life. \\"Beard\\" abruptly dies—his bloody corpse remaining at his places of work—and he is replaced by an abrasive bald man, Richter, who offers Jacket nothing. One day, Jacket arrives home to find his girlfriend murdered and a man in a rat mask on his couch, who shoots him in the head. The attack puts Jacket in a coma; he wakes up in a hospital and overhears that his attacker is in police custody, whereupon he escapes and storms Miami police headquarters. Jacket discovers his attacker was Richter, who had also been following the orders of threatening messages, and steals the file on the police's investigation of the killings. The player, after interrogating Richter, can choose either to kill him by suffocation or to spare him and walk away after hurting him. Canonically, Jacket decides to spare him, as seen in the sequel. With this, he raids the mob-owned nightclub the calls were tracked to, finding the address of the headquarters of Miami's Russian mafia. Jacket then goes to this address and kills the syndicate's leaders. The game's main story ends with Jacket killing off the Russian mafia's leaders, but afterwards the player can play bonus levels as the biker character from the telephone company. Another recipient of the mysterious messages, The Biker has gotten fed up of carrying out their assignments and is trying to track the callers down. From raiding the phone company, he traces the calls to the mob-owned nightclub. At the nightclub, The Biker finds a hidden basement, where two janitors have been sending out the mysterious messages. If the player has found secret letters hidden in Jacket's missions, The Biker will crack their computer's password and learn the janitors work for 50 Blessings, an ostensibly peaceful patriotic organisation, and have been using its membership to carry out killings to derail an alliance between the Soviet Union and the United States. The Janitors boast their \\"experiment\\" is only the \\"tip of the iceberg\\" of a larger conspiracy. Without the password, the janitors claim they were acting out of boredom and mock The Biker's attempt to rationalise his actions. = Characters = Most names below are unofficial, serving as monikers for the unnamed characters: * Jacket – He is the main protagonist of the game. He wears various masks and his iconic letterman jacket, which is yellow and white in game to match the neon palette of the game whilst its official colors are brown with beige sleeves and a yellow B patch. Jacket performs a number of brutal assassinations in response to cryptic messages left on his answering machine. He is later attacked by another masked assassin, who kills his girlfriend. Because of this, he pursues those he feels are responsible. While he is given no name, various pieces of merchandise and cross-promotion have adopted \\"Jacket\\" as his official moniker. * The Biker – The protagonist of the chapters that occur after the main storyline is finished. He receives the same phone calls as Jacket, but is less willing to follow their instructions, eventually trying to end his affiliation with the group. This eventually leads him to a confrontation with Jacket. He is playable in the later chapters, but uses a different play style than Jacket: he is unable to use stray weapons and can only use a cleaver as well as three throwing knives. * Richter – Another person receiving the same messages. He is the one who attacked Jacket and killed his girlfriend. * Richard, Rasmus and Don Juan – Three masked personas that Jacket sees within his distorted reality. * The Girlfriend – A blonde woman the protagonist rescues early in the game. While nursing her back to health, it is implied the two begin a relationship. She is later murdered by Richter. * Beard – The only apparent friend of Jacket's, who works at every shop Jacket visits. * The Janitors – A couple of sneering green-attired \\"janitors\\", one blond and one brown-haired, belonging to the militant American nationalist group known as 50 Blessings. They turn out to be behind the campaign of brutal terrorist violence in which Jacket, The Biker, and Richter are involved as perpetrators. They are modeled after the creators of the game, Wedin and Söderström.  Development  = Early concept = Hotline Miami was a spiritual successor to an unreleased game called Super Carnage. Jonatan Söderström started working on the game when he was 18, describing it as a top-down shoot-em-up in which the aim was to kill as many people as possible. The project was cancelled following difficulties programming the game's artificial intelligence's pathfinding. Söderström later met Dennis Wedin, singer and keyboard player in the synthpunk band Fucking Werewolf Asso. They collaborated on a promotional game for the band called Keyboard Drumset Fucking Werewolf, and another game, Life/Death/Island, which was cancelled. Söderström and Wedin decided that their next game would be a commercial release, due to financial difficulties. They saw Super Carnage and its potential as a game. They decided to expand upon this, and thus they started developing Hotline Miami. Immediately after being shown the prototype of Super Carnage, Dennis Wedin was excited to start working on the game. When asked in an interview about his initial thoughts on being shown Söderström's prototype, Wedin stated \\"I loved it right from the start! I played his prototype for quite a while (even though it was just one level) and that was the most exciting part, making a game that we loved to play ourselves. We never really thought about what anyone else would think, we just wanted to play it and to do that we had to make it\\". = Inspiration = The biggest influence on the game's story was David Lynch. Another notable influence on the story was the 2011 film Drive. Gordon Freeman, the silent protagonist from the Half-Life series, was also of influence. The documentary Cocaine Cowboys influenced the developer's decision to use 1980's Miami as a setting. On the use of masks, the designers said they were inspired by the movie Kick-Ass and tried to figure out a way where someone without a lot of money would be able to disguise themselves.  Marketing and release  The cover art was created by Swedish painter Niklas Åkerblad. Leading up to the release of Hotline Miami, Devolver Digital opened a phone line in Miami, Florida to enable people to call and leave voice messages of their own. Some time after the official release of the game in late October 2012, a trailer was created using these recordings. In early November 2012, an update for the game added support for gamepad control, multiple bug fixes, a few gameplay tweaks, graphical adjustments, and a new bonus map called 'Highball'. By mid- December 2012, the game's publisher, Devolver Digital, revealed that 130,000 copies of the game had been sold in the seven weeks since it launched. In an interview at Eurogamer, project manager Graeme Struthers was \\"chuffed to bits\\" for Hotline Miami creators Jonatan Söderström and Dennis Wedin, adding that \\"those are some talented boys.\\" In an interview with Pocket Gamer, Söderström was quoted as saying that his team had been talking to Sony about bringing the game to PlayStation devices – including the PlayStation Vita – although they would require a third party to port it for them. The creators were also considering porting the game to iOS and Android touchscreen devices, The OS X version was released on 19 March 2013. In mid-February 2013, Devolver Digital and developer Dennaton Games confirmed that the game would be coming to PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita in the summer of the same year. The title would be cross-buy, allowing those who have purchased the game on either Vita or PlayStation 3 to play it across both platforms, only having to buy it once. The port was handled by Abstraction Games, who shifted the engine from Game Maker 7 to PhyreEngine, also adding enhanced controls, an extra unlockable mask, and online leaderboards. These features were later added for existing PC owners as a patch. It was also revealed that, at this point, over 300,000 copies of the game had been sold. On 28 May 2013, it was featured on the eighth Humble Indie Bundle as one of the games offered if paying above the average amount. The Linux version for Hotline Miami was released concurrently with the bundle as at that time. On the night of 24 June 2013, the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita version of Hotline Miami was released early, due to scheduled maintenance of the PlayStation Network. On 24 March 2014, Devolver Digital announced that the game would be headed to the PlayStation 4 with cross-buy support. The PlayStation 4 version of Hotline Miami was released on 19 August 2014. On 11 September 2014, Overkill Software, the developers of Payday 2, released an announcement that there would be a downloadable content pack based on Hotline Miami, released on 30 September as a collaboration between Dennaton Games and Overkill Software. In Japan, Spike Chunsoft released the localized editions of Hotline Miami and Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita bundled together and released as Hotline Miami: Collected Edition on 25 June 2015. On 19 August 2019, Hotline Miami and Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number were released on Nintendo Switch as a bundle, called Hotline Miami Collection. On 7 April 2020, Hotline Miami Collection was ported to Xbox One.  Soundtrack  The Hotline Miami – Official Soundtrack could first be found on Devolver Digital's SoundCloud account. It was later made available to purchase on Valve's digital distribution platform, Steam, as downloadable content for the main game. Although the soundtrack is available for purchase, all of the music files can be found within the game folder in Ogg vorbis format (albeit often in edited versions).  Reception  = Critical reception = Hotline Miami received critical acclaim upon release, with praise given to its neon-soaked depiction of 1980s underground Miami, overflowing with raw brutality and ultraviolent close combat as the player finds himself outgunned and using his wits to choreograph a way through impossible situations. The game's soundtrack was lauded for accentuating the already heightened tension and gritty violence. Review aggregator website Metacritic gave the PlayStation 3 version 87/100 based on 19 reviews, the PlayStation Vita version 85/100 based on 27 reviews, and the Microsoft Windows version 85/100 based on 51 reviews. Eurogamer scored the game 10/10, with reviewer Tom Bramwell saying that the game was a blend of elements, all of which are integral to the overall experience. PopMatters scored the PlayStation 3 version of the game 9/10, and the reviewer Eric Swain wrote \\"Hotline Miami is still an introspective surrealist dive into the mind of a maniac who lives within the neon gloss of the late '80s. You still go around killing groups of thugs at the behest of a voice on the other side of the phone calls, which is somehow sufficient to addle you into killing everyone you find at an address that that voice provides. You still choose an animal mask to wear before entering these kill zones, and you still have a variety of weapons at your disposal to stab, shoot, and bludgeon your way through crowds of Russian thugs and the police.\\" IGN gave the game a score of 8.8/10 emphasizing its \\"striking blend of fast ultraviolence, a dense, challenging story and brilliant presentation.\\" In its final verdict for the game, the reviewer Charles Onyett stated \\"Hotline Miami momentum of mystery builds right up to its finale, where snarling cynicism is offered as a justification for why all this machinery of neon fuzz and thumping bass, bright blood and fractured identity was started up in the first place. Yet the justification is also disarmingly simple, the same reason why quarters were dropped into arcade machines built during the late '80s era Dennaton Games so clearly reveres. Why bother with Hotline Miami? Because it exists. Because it's fun. Because it deserves to be played.\\" = Awards = The game received the \\"Best PC Sound\\" accolade by IGN from its \\"Best of 2012\\" awards. It was also nominated for \\"Best PC Action Game\\", \\"Best PC Story\\", \\"Best PC Game\\", in addition to \\"Best Overall Action Game\\", \\"Best Overall Music\\", and \\"Best Overall Game\\". It was the recipient of both Eurogamer and Rock, Paper, Shotgun Game of the Show award at their inaugural EGX Rezzed expo. On 24 December 2012, PC Gamer awarded the game with \\"The Best Music of the Year 2012\\". Hotline Miami also won \\"Best New IP\\", \\"Best Gameplay\\" and \\"Best Soundtrack\\" at the 2012 Vidya Gaem Awards, and received several nominations in other categories. = Piracy = When questioned about piracy issues by Eurogamer, Graeme Struthers of Devolver Digital said \\"[Söderström] just felt he didn't want people playing the buggy version of his game however they got it. He wanted them to get the patch. He basically said, 'I'm not going to criticise this, it's a fact of life. It would be nice if guys could find it within themselves to pay for it, but that's the world I'm in, so you know, you just have to take it for what it is.' It has been torrented to such a staggering level, and given the file size of it, I mean, you can't really be surprised, right? You could pass this thing around on the world's smallest memory stick. So it has been torrented to extraordinary levels.\\"  Sequel  In an interview with Jonatan Söderström and Dennis Wedin at Eurogamer, the creators shed some light on possible new future game content. When prompted with the question of upcoming downloadable content, the creators revealed, \\"I think we're going to do quite a big project. It will probably be about as long as the full game, so probably we'll charge something for it. It will be like a sequel kind of, but building on the story. We don't want to reveal too much, but it will probably have more playable characters than the first game did. And a couple of different stories and angles. A lot of people have been asking about a map editor to build their own stages, so we're looking at if it's possible to do that. I think it would be really cool to let people do their own stages.\\" In terms of the new soundtrack, Söderström said \\"I'm not sure for the second game yet. Last time we had nine different musicians doing the soundtrack. Looks like a couple of them might do more tracks for the sequel, but we've been looking at some other bands as well. Want to keep it fresh.\\" Hinting that the sequel may be some way off, Söderström insisted that he was still committed to working on patching and fixing the original game. The official Hotline Miami Twitter released photographs of the sequel's title screen, revealing its full title: Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number. On 19 June 2013, the first teaser trailer for the sequel was released on the Devolver Digital YouTube channel. The game was initially announced for 2014, but was eventually released on 10 March 2015. A Hotline Miami Collection, containing both games, was released for the Nintendo Switch on 19 August 2019, and Xbox One on 7 April 2020.

This was once a villa or a humble cottage of Kurita Chodō, a haiku poet of the Edo period. Today, part of the house was restored to preserve its original form as one of the special historic sites in Ehime, and NPO corporation GCM Kōshin-an Club are involved in voluntary activities to promote it.

Chodō enjoyed haiku gatherings, tea ceremony and simply viewing the garden. Then he wrote about his reclusive life in this cottage in his journal Kōshin-an ki (庚申庵記). According to the journal, Chodō named his cottage \\"Kōshin-an\\" for the year of its construction, Kōshin.Matsui Shinobu. GCM koshin-an Club, ed. Kōshin-an eno Izanai (Introduction to Kōshin- an).

To match the needs of each owner, extensions and reconstructions are repeated. From then on, in about 200 years, the house had been abandoned and affected by natural disasters. However, local residents might struggle to preserve the place and refurbished it. The house still has original shape and atmosphere. Although the surrounding area was destroyed during World War II, the cottage including the garden miraculously remained.Matsui, 2003. 74-75 Be endangered for some years, a report by a student from Shinonome University triggered preserving and restoring the humble cottage as a historical valuable place, and in 2000, Matsuyama City decided to reserve and reconstruct as a publicly owned land. After the investigation and restoration with removal of extended section, Kōshin-an was restored much as it was in Edo era. In 2003, the house and its garden was opened as a historic garden.Matsui, 2003. 80-82 Structure The house was originally composed of three rooms with an entrance. One of the rooms was called \\"yojo-han\\" or four and half tatami mats, and used for haiku gatherings. The room is rather unusual that it has no tokonoma; an alcove where art or flowers are displayed. So there was no Kamiza (place of honor) there. It is because Chodō wanted his guests to be equal in the gatherings, regardless of their social status. Another room was \\"sanjo\\" or three tatami mats room which is used for tea ceremony and enjoying talking with friends. The \\"nijo\\" or two tatami mats room was used for his daily life. Thanks to the research of members of the house, it was found out that kitchen and bathroom were added onto the house, the entrance was modified. As for the rooms, relatively new materials are used in \\"yojo-han\\" and \\"nijo\\" tatami rooms, and it shows that these rooms were modified after his time.Matsui, 2003. 73-75 Entrance and garden In the entrance gate, The kuhi include a haiku by Kurita Chodō: :草の戸乃ふる幾友也梅の花 （樗堂題） ::kusa no to no furuki tomo nari ume no hana :the grassy door :an old friend :with the plum tree Originally, This poem was written in a hanging scroll in the house.

It is often used in communicative language teaching and task-based language learning. Information gap tasks are contrasted with opinion gap tasks, in which all information is shared at the start of the activity, and learners give their own opinions on the information given.  Examples  An example of a spot-the-difference activity One example of an information gap task is a spot-the-difference activity. Another is an activity where one student is given a picture, and must describe it to another student, who creates a drawing from the description. Further examples are students sharing information to complete a class timetable, and an activity where students must share information about their families and then draw each other's family trees.  Testing  Information gap tasks are also used to test language ability. According to Underhill, these kind of tasks have the advantage that they produce concrete evidence of communicative competence, or of the lack of it, but the disadvantage of only testing the ability to communicate factual information. He goes on to say that with information gap tasks, care must be taken not to create a test which tests general problem-solving ability more than language fluency.

Pfinder was designed by Wren, et al. of the MIT Media Laboratory in 1997. As described by its authors, Pfinder is a \\"real-time system for tracking people and interpreting their behavior\\". The system improves upon previous works by not only identifying the boundaries of a person in the image, but also analyzing the regions inside the boundaries and relating them to the known structure of the human body. As an example, Pfinder can track a person's head and hands, and can determine the pose of the body and recognize gestures.  Limitations  * Pfinder does not cope with multi-modal backgrounds, in which a histogram of the pixel intensity contains more than one distinct peak. * While it can handle small or gradual changes in lighting, it does not react well to large, sudden lighting changes. When there are large lighting changes, the system mistakenly labels them as a part of the foreground, and therefore tries to incorporate them into the human figure model. * Pfinder is not able to handle multiple people in the same image well. While the blobs representing each person would be detected, the system would attempt to analyze them as one distinct human figure.

It broadcasts locally on Bauer's 11B Inverness DAB Multiplex. It broadcasts nationally via Smart Speaker streaming and online web streaming. Its output is non-stop classic 1960s hits, followed by hits of the 1950s played alongside. History Details of Absolute Radio's plan to extend its decade-themed radio stations were released in October 2010, following the success of Absolute Radio 80s and Absolute Radio 90s, the former of which was ranked eleventh in terms of listener numbers. Two new stations were announced on the same day, 18 October, Absolute Radio 60s and Absolute Radio 70s, both of which would be dedicated to the music of their respective decades. A holding website went live at absoluteradio60s.co.uk following the announcement, with basic information including the proposed station schedule. It was later revealed that Absolute Radio 60s would share some of the DAB multiplexes used by Absolute Classic Rock, with the latter reducing its broadcast capacity on each multiplex to make space available for Absolute Radio 60s. The 60s service began broadcasting from 22 November 2011 on various DAB multiplexes around the country and online. Absolute Radio 70s launched a week later. Upon its launch the station was more widely available than its 70s counterpart, airing on DAB in London, the north and west of England, and Scotland. On 23 April 2013, the Radio Today website reported that Absolute Radio had removed Absolute Radio 60s and Absolute Classic Rock from several DAB platforms in England and Wales, but the stations continued to broadcast in London and online. On 18 September 2014, it was reported that Absolute Radio 60s would be removed from London and the few other remaining local DAB multiplexes but would be added to Inverness DAB. The space freed up by this move was to allow Bauer to increase the coverage of its Kisstory station. This final reconfiguration of Absolute Radio 60s occurred on 5 January 2015. Format Although a separate entity, Absolute Radio 60s takes a limited amount of programming from the main Absolute Radio station, chiefly The Christian O'Connell Breakfast Show and the weekend programmes The Frank Skinner Show and Jason Manford. From 23 September 2019, weekday afternoon drivetime show Hometime with Bush and Richie is also syndicated. The weekday shows are simulcast live, with weekend shows broadcast on a delay; all replace the music played with 1960s tracks using a split playlist system. Outside of these programmes, the station no longer has any regularly presented shows. Absolute 60s plays a broad mix of music from the decade, although it tends to be geared towards the genre of music heard on Absolute Radio. Tracks typically to be heard on the station include those from the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Velvet Underground and Motown. However, other bands and artists who enjoyed success during the 1960s, such as The Searchers and Cliff Richard are not included on the playlist. During an interview prior to the station's launch, Pete Mitchell, who would be presenting on Absolute Radio 60s, stressed that the station would not adopt a \\"gold\\" format, but would instead play tracks by those who had had an influence on the musicians of the present day. According to The Guardian the Absolute Radio 60s aim is to combine \\"the \\"swinging 60s\\" with \\"the sound of young America\\".\\"  Cliff Richard barred airplay  During the launch of AR60s, Richard was barred from the station's playlist, according to presenter Pete Michell, because he \\"doesn't fit the cool sound of the swinging sixties we're trying to create on the new station\\" and he's not one of the 'timeless acts of the decade that remain relevant today.' In response to this, Richard accused that the station \\"is lying to themselves and the public.\\" He also stated that he sold more singles than The Beatles, and started five years before them as well. On the 16 November 2011, Geoff Lloyd (an original Absolute Radio drive presenter) posted a video on YouTube to explain this more systematically. He said that The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, Motown \\"still resonates today\\" and when new bands are created today, \\"they're listening to those records and getting inspired\\" but that doesn't happen for Richard because \\"he has no artistic integrity or credibility\\" and he's just \\"a singer who sings other's materials.\\" References External links * Radio stations established in 2011 2011 establishments in the United Kingdom Absolute Radio 1960s-themed radio stations Bauer Radio ","title":"Absolute Radio 60s"},{"id":"36531969","text":"The Paria brushfinch (Arremon phygas) is a species of bird in the family Passerellidae.

It broadcasts locally on Bauer’s 11B Tayside DAB Multiplex. It broadcasts nationally via Smart Speaker streaming and online web streaming. It’s output is non-stop 1970s hits. History Details of Absolute Radio's plan to extend their decade-themed radio stations were released in October 2010, and following the success of Absolute Radio 80s and Absolute Radio 90s, the former of which was ranked eleventh in terms of listener numbers. Two new stations were announced, Absolute Radio 60s and Absolute Radio 70s, both of which would be dedicated to the music of their respective decades. Initially the 70s station would be available on DAB in London only, but would be accessible nationally and internationally through an online service. A website holding page was opened at absoluteradio70s.co.uk in line with the announcement of the station, which carries station information and an indicative schedule. The 60s service went on air on 22 November 2011, with Absolute Radio 70s launching a week later on 29 November. Absolute Radio 70s shares the DAB slot currently used by Absolute Radio 00s, with 00s cutting its broadcast capacity (and switching to broadcast in mono) to release space for the 70s service. At the time of its launch Absolute Radio 70s branded itself as \\"The UK's only 70s radio station\\", but was joined on DAB within a few weeks by Smooth 70s, a similarly themed station from GMG Radio which was launched nationally on DAB on 27 December 2011. However, in spite of its competitor, Absolute 70s continued to style itself as the UK's only 1970s-themed radio station. Smooth 70s subsequently ceased transmission on 6 October 2013, and its national frequency was taken over by Capital XTRA. Six years later, Global resumed transmission of a national 70s music service with the launch of Heart 70s, which is now Absolute 70s' chief competitor (other stations, such as Pirate 70s have existed in the interim, but generally to a smaller broadcast area - in Pirate's case, Cornwall). Format Although a separate entity, Absolute Radio 70s takes a limited amount of programming from the main Absolute Radio station, chiefly The Dave Berry Breakfast Show and The Frank Skinner Show. Hometime with Bush and Richie was added to the schedule of Absolute's digital stations from 23 September 2019. The station itself was originally fronted by former Radio 1 presenter Richard Skinner, who presented an afternoon programme. Following the station's 2018 downgrading, there were no presenters outside of shows shared with Absolute Radio and some specials; in summer 2019, former Gold breakfast presenter Tony Dibbin joined Bauer to present a weekday daytime show on Absolute Radio 70s, which became the only presented programme exclusive to the 70s station. Absolute 70s plays a broad mix of music from the 1970s, ranging from rock and punk to glam and soul. Artists and groups typically heard on the station include David Bowie, Kate Bush, Elton John and Blondie.  Distribution  The station's DAB transmission was originally solely to London, in contrast to the wider distribution of its siblings, and the 70s station was not affected by the December 2014/January 2015 changes which impacted many of Absolute's other digital transmissions including those of Absolute Radio 60s. Absolute Radio 70s has been made available more widely through online transmission via Absolute's website and apps, where it appears alongside the other Absolute network stations. The 70s service was made available nationally via digital satellite television from 9 February 2015, when the station took over a Sky guide slot previously occupied by Insight Radio; it joins Absolute's 80s, 90s and Classic Rock stations on the Sky lineup. Although Absolute Radio 70s was not guide-listed on Freesat, it could be manually tuned into by Freesat boxes. The station was removed from Sky on 4 June 2018, and was replaced by Hits Radio. May 2018 also saw the station, and Kerrang! Radio, removed from London DAB to release space for the addition of Hits Radio; the stations were kept active by relocating to Bauer's Tayside DAB multiplex - a similar 'placeholder' move had shifted DAB transmission of Absolute's 60s and 00s stations to Inverness as part of the 2014/15 reshuffle (00s having previously been broadcast in London alongside the 70s service.)

History The station was opened in 1845/46 along with the Main-Neckar Railway between Frankfurt and Heidelberg. The plans for the entrance building were probably drawn up by the Darmstadt court architect Georg Moller. Originally the station was built as a two-storey building with a roof turret. Years later, an extra storey was added. Similarly, two smaller buildings were added. The main building is built in yellow sandstone and has three floors. The division between the floors is marked by red sandstone. The windows are also framed in red sandstone. North of the building is the old walled garden of the former station master. Infrastructure The platforms of Zwingenberg The station is classified as a category 5 station. 44 Regionalbahn services stop in Zwingenberg each day. In December 2007, Deutsche Bahn announced that it intended to sell the station building and shortly later that it had sold it to an investor. A ticket machine is located only at the station building. Since the station is equipped with external platforms on the double-track line that are not directly connected by a pedestrian underpass, passengers heading south towards Bensheim or Heidelberg and who need to purchase a ticket must take into account the time needed to use the ticket machine and cross the tracks (about 8 minutes).

The Size 30 painting, measuring , depicts a scene of a ploughed field near the asylum at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, with a lilac bush, a peasant carrying a wheatsheaf, several buildings, and the Alpilles mountains rising behind, with a small patch of sky. Van Gogh considered it a pendant painting to The Reaper executed earlier in 1889. It is currently part of the permanent collection at the Indianapolis Museum of Art. Description Enclosed Field with Peasant is an example of Van Gogh's late work, where his dynamic brush strokes take control of the paintings. The painting's hurried lines accentuate a vibrant, moving field. The painting seems to pulsate with life, even though only one human is shown. It is the most topographically accurate of van Gogh's four views of a wheat field at the base of the Alpilles. It was created en plein air over several days, during one of the most tumultuous parts of Van Gogh's life, shortly after he resumed painting after he had voluntarily committed himself to an asylum in Saint-Rémy. He was recuperating from a nervous breakdown he suffered on Christmas Eve in 1888, during a visit with fellow postimpressionist Paul Gauguin. He described the painting in two letters written in October 1889, one to Émile Bernard, as \\"a no. 30 canvas with broken lilac ploughed fields and a background of mountains that go all the way up the canvas; so nothing but rough ground and rocks, with a thistle and dry grass in a corner, and a little violet and yellow man\\",Letter to Emile Bernard. Saint- Rémy, on or about Tuesday, 8 October 1889, vangoghletters.org and another to his brother, Theo van Gogh, as \\"the same field as the one of the reaper. Now it’s mounds of earth and the background parched lands, then the rocks of the Alpilles. A bit of blue-green sky with small white and violet cloud. In the foreground: A thistle and some dry grass. A peasant dragging a bundle of straw in the middle. It’s another harsh study, and instead of being almost entirely yellow it makes an almost completely violet canvas. Broken and neutral violets … I think that this will complement the reaper and will make it easier to see what it is. For the reaper appears done at random, and this with it will balance it.\\".Letter to Theo van Gogh. Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, on or about Tuesday, 8 October 1889, vangoghletters.org Reception Van Gogh sent the painting to his brother Theo in January 1890, along with a letter which described it as \\"Ploughed Field, with background of mountains\\", and again suggested that this violet-toned work could be a pendant with his yellow- dominated painting of The Reaper.Letter to Theo van Gogh. Saint-Rémy-de- Provence, Friday, 3 January 1890, vangoghletters.org Van Gogh had made a Size 30 version of The Reaper (also known as Wheat Field with Reaper and Sun, F617) in June 1889, which is now held by the Kröller-Müller Museum in Otterlo. He also made two similar versions of The Reaper in September and October 1889: a second Size 30 version (F618) is held by the Van Gogh Museum, and a smaller Size 20 version (F619) held by the Museum Folkwang in Essen. Enclosed Field with Peasant was retained by Theo after Vincent's death later in 1890, and inherited on Theo's own death several months later by his widow, Johanna van Gogh-Bonger. In May 1905, it was bought and then exhibited by the art dealer Paul Cassirer in Berlin, where it was sold to the German banker . Upon his death in 1917, it was inherited by his wife Giulietta (who was the daughter of Michele Gordigiani); and upon her death in 1955, it was passed to their children, Elenora and Francesco von Mendelssohn, who emigrated to the US in 1935 and 1933 respectively, taking the painting with them.

Biography Born in Lavello, Basilicata, Tartaglia trained at the military school of Ceccolo Broglia and served the Republic of Florence. On 26 June 1402, he fought in the Battle of Casalecchio; he was charged with overseeing the bridge of Reno, but he left his position to participate in the combat, leaving the camps without any defense on his side. His imprudence cost the defeat of his army, and Tartaglia was captured and imprisoned. Released, he assumed responsibility for the defeat, but not enough to appease the wrath of Muzio Attendolo Sforza. Relations between Tartaglia and Sforza became bad, resulting in a strong rivalry. In 1409, he fought in the service of Ladislaus of Naples, defending Perugia and Civitavecchia from the assaults of Braccio da Montone and conquering Rome, scaring away the antipope John XXIII. As a token of gratitude, Ladislaus gave him the title of Lord of Toscanella in 1413. In 1418, he swore allegiance to Pope Martin V and occupied Assisi one year later and other territories between Lazio and Umbria. Tartaglia was arrested while sleeping by his rival, Muzio Attendolo. After being tortured, he was decapitated at Aversa in 1421. Bibliography *Antonio Di Chicco, Il condottiero Angelo Tartaglia di Lavello, nel primo Ventennio del sec. XV, Lavello, Tip.

The practice of using trees as lookouts was widespread in the western United States during the early 20th century, as there was no need to build a foundation or to pack and assemble a tower structure. Instead, a prominent tree could be selected, and a ladder or a series of spikes could be attached to the tree trunk. For transient use this could be all that was done, but for more permanent use the top of the tree could be lopped, and a platform constructed on the resulting stump. This railed platform was then outfitted with a seat and a platform for an Osborne Fire Finder. A Multiple Property Submission survey of lookout trees in Kaibab National Forest and Grand Canyon National Park in northern Arizona was carried out in 1987 as an addendum to a survey of fire towers in Arizona. Surviving trees with significant remains of their lookout function were individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places and were described in the MPS. Many of these lookouts were established between 1905 and 1920. Many more trees existed than were nominated, but the missing trees have either disappeared or were not located.

It is won by the rider that crosses a particular point in the race, mostly the summits of the highest and iconic climbs in the Alps and Pyrenees. It is named in honour of the creator and first race director of the Tour, French sports journalist Henri Desgrange, who was passionate about taking the Tour de France as high up in the mountains as possible using the most difficult routes. History Following the death of Desgrange in August 1940, an award was given in his honour for the first time in the 1947 Tour, the first Tour since 1939, having been cancelled during World War II. On stage 11, Raymond Impanis was the first of the field to pass a point by Desgrange's final residence, the \\"Villa Mia\\" in Beauvallon, Grimaud, on the French Riviera. In the first stage of the 1948 Tour, the prize was earned by Roger Lambrecht in opening few kilometres at the summit of the Côte de Picardie climb in Versailles, Paris. Beauvallon again hosted the award the following year, before the 1950 and 1951 Tours saw the award marker point moved into the mountains atop the -high Col du Lautaret, the pass that directly precedes the Galibier climb from the south. In 1949, a monument to Desgrange was built from the southern entrance of the summit tunnel atop the Col du Galibier in the Alps, his favourite and one of the Tour's most iconic climbs. A wreath is laid at the monument when the Tour passes. Beginning in 1952, the marking point for the prize took place by the monument for the subsequent times the Tour visited the Galibier. Since the 1965 Tour, the Galibier has always been used when it was passed. The tunnel at the summit of the Galibier was closed for safety reasons in 1976 – evenually re-opening in 2002. Bypassing the tunnel, the road was then extended a further kilometre up to the natural crest of the pass, increasing the elevation of the summit by 86 meters to . This has been award's marking point on the Galibier ever since it was first traversed in the 1979 Tour, when Lucien Van Impe claimed the award. The tunnel was passed through on stage 19 of the 2011 Tour, but in that edition the Galibier was climb twice in celebration the 100th anniversary of its appearance in the Tour. The finish of the previous stage was atop the full Galibier climb, where Andy Schleck claimed memorable stage win as well as the award after his solo breakaway. This was first ever Galibier summit stage finish and the highest ever Tour stage finish in history to that point. Further notable stages featuring the award on the Galibier were in the 1952 and 1998 Tours, when Italians Fausto Coppi and Marco Pantani, respectively, took the award and then went on to win the stage, which proved decisive to both their overall general classification victories. Non-summit marking points have been sparsely used for the award. Beauvallon was a host for a total of six times, with final appearance in the 1964 Tour. The village of Cysoing in the far north hosted on the 1956 Tour, marking 200,000 kilometres travelled in Tour de France history. Only twice have non-summit marking points happened since 1964. Stage 11 of the 1978 race saw the award given to Christian Seznec at the legendary village of Sainte-Marie de Campan in the valley between the Col du Tourmalet and Col d'Aspin in the Pyrenees, made famous when in the 1913 Tour, per the rules, Eugène Christophe was forced walk down the Tourmalet carrying his bicycle broken before repairing it at a forge in Campan. The last time a non-summit point took place during the Grand Départ (opening stages) of the 1981 Tour, hosted by Nice, with the award at first planned to take place in the final kilometres of stage 1a beside the Carrefour supermarket on the Promenade des Anglais. This break from tradition was seen by the media as disrespectful to the race and the legacy of Desgrange. For unknown reasons the marking point banner was stolen the night before. The replacement banner was strung up in the Landes forest before the end of stage 7 in Bordeaux, which was won unexpectedly by Theo de Rooij as a result of him being at the front of the leading breakaway group. From the 1965 Tour onwards, if the Galibier was not passed then the award was instead given atop a climb of similarly equal height, most commonly the Tourmalet, and beginning with the 1997 Tour, the highest climb of a Tour was mostly used when the Galibier was not included. Since the 2013 Tour, the highest climb has always been used (). On two occasions the Galibier climb been cancelled because of bad weather and the award locations were moved; snow in 1996 saw it replaced by the -high Pyreenan Col d'Aubisque, and landslides in 2015 moved the award to -high Alpine Col d'Allos. The amount of cash given as a prize for the award was higher in the early Tours. Cash prizes have also been given to the second and third placed riders. Since 2003, the winner has received a €5000 prize. Only in the 1963 Tour has the award not been given, although at the conclusion of that race there was a special \\"Desgrange prize\\" given to the general classification winner Jacques Anquetil who was adjudged to have had the best \\"head and legs\\" throughout the Tour. The Souvenir Jacques Goddet, honouring the second Tour director Jacques Goddet, is a similar award in the race given since the 2001 Tour mostly atop the Tourmalet.

It has been released on iOS, Android and Microsoft Windows. The game is a sequel to Great Little War Game. The game features multiple environment types, and 50 levels in campaign mode and for the first time in the series cross platform online multiplayer. Gameplay Similar in gameplay to Great Little War Game, players take control of an army. Generally, players must destroy the enemy's headquarters to win the game, through in campaign missions the objective of the mission varies. The player who goes second gets a coin advantage to counterbalance the player going first. Players use troop units to shoot other units and enemy buildings. Most unit types are focused on damaging enemy units and buildings, while some types of units have different functions. For example, the engineer captures buildings not owned by the current player, fleet oilers and supply trucks restore unit ammo and fuel, and jeeps, ferries, and sky hooks can carry units. The player can create new units using coins, obtained by having oil derricks captured when a new day starts. Infantry units can be hired at barracks, land vehicles at factories, sea vehicles at ship yards, and air vehicles at airbases. Player units can be promoted after defeating enough enemies without dying, which will make them able to take more damage and also be able to do more damage in a single shot. Units can run out of ammo, and vehicles can run out of fuel as well, and units can be healed/repaired and fuel and ammo replenished by going on the spawn pad of a building owned by a player. Each kind of offensive unit is built to take on different types of units, for example bazooka units are more powerful against vehicle units than grunts due to being specialized in defeating vehicles, while commandos are more expensive than grunts but are much more effective against taking down infantry. Also, offensive units have a set range which dictates at which distance the unit can fire enemies, this changes depending on the current elevation of the unit. In the campaign mode, battle points can be used to permanently upgrade kinds of units that will be used in the campaign. Battle points can be obtained by finding star shaped boxes in each mission, and some are automatically obtained by completing missions. New to the game is Fog of War, which obscures the parts of the map that cannot be seen by the player's units or by captured radar installations with thick fog that makes it impossible to see. Also, buildings can now be damaged by units, damaged buildings will not be as effective as undamaged buildings, by recruiting damaged units or giving out less coins per day for example. Reception Much like its predecessor GBWG has received mostly positive reviews. IGN gave it a score of 9.5 out of 10.0 and an Editors' Choice award, comparing the gameplay of the game to the Advance Wars franchise, and praising the game for its long campaign. The game was nominated for Best Strategy Game in 2013 by BAFTA.

Early years Born in London as one of nine children, Harry Edwards was son of printer and a dressmaker. In 1905, aged 12, Edwards joined the London Diocese Church Lads Brigade. In 1907 he left school and began a seven- year apprenticeship to a printer. Dissatisfied with that career, he developed political aspirations and joined the local branch of the Liberal Party, for whom he campaigned.Redwood, Dawn ‘’ The Harry Edwards Spiritual Healing Sanctuary’’ – brief biography On the outbreak of World War I in 1914 Edwards enlisted in the Royal Sussex Regiment and by late 1915 he was in Bombay en route for Tekrit, where he worked to build the railway track between there and Baghdad. He was commissioned in the field, and achieved the rank of Captain.Biography of Harry Edwards In 1921 he returned to the UK and married Phyllis. The couple opened a stationer's shop and printing works in Balham, and Edwards tried to launch himself into a political career, standing for parliamentary and council seats as a Liberal candidate on several occasions, but with no success. By this stage he also had four children to support. Spiritual healing The Harry Edwards Spiritual Healing Sanctuary at Shere, Surrey Edwards became a spiritual healer when he attended a meeting at a spiritualist church in 1935 and was told by the mediums present that he had healing powers. His early attempts at spiritual healing were met with success, and gradually his reputation as a healer spread and his services became more in demand. During the Second World War Edwards served in the Home Guard and continued to run his printing business alongside his now growing practice as a healer. Gradually, as his fame spread, his healing took over from his printing business, which was later to be run by a brother. He moved to Stoneleigh in Surrey just after the war, where he used the front room of his house as a healing sanctuary. Eventually, because of the increasing number of patients visiting him Edwards outgrew this home, so in 1946 he moved his family and his healing practice to Burrows Lea, a large house with several acres of gardens and woodland in Shere, where he founded the 'Harry Edwards Healing Sanctuary'. As his fame as a healer spread he was receiving 10,000 letters a week asking for help and distance healing. In 1948 Edwards held a healing demonstration in Manchester which was attended by 6,000 people. In September 1951 during the Festival of Britain he appeared at the Royal Festival Hall in London, where he demonstrated spiritual healing to a packed hall. In 1955 he founded and was the first President of the National Federation of Spiritual Healers (NFSH).Harry Edwards Tribute website Edwards visited the island of Cyprus for his initiation into Daskalos' inner circle \\"The Researchers of Truth\\". The ceremony took place on 1 April 1954. An 'Archbishops' Commission on Divine Healing' was set up in 1953 to investigate spiritual healing, and Edwards addressed the Commission in 1954, providing it with documentary evidence of a number of cases of successful healing for it to examine. At the same time he held a public demonstration in front of 6,000 people at the Royal Albert Hall to launch the '10 o'clock Healing Minute'. The Commission's report, published in 1958,The ‘Archbishops’ Commission on Divine Healing’ in the National Church Institutions Database of Manuscripts and Archives stated that neither the Church or the medical profession accepted the claims of spirit healers that they were responsible for successful healings. Despite the fact that Harry Edwards had appeared before the Commission he was never sent a copy of the final report. Edwards claimed that several deceased scientists worked through him, including Lord Lister and Louis Pasteur. The founder of the Aetherius Society, George King was complimentary of his healing powers.Jason-Lloyd, Len ‘’Insight into Harry Edwards’’ Harry Edwards died in December 1976 aged 83. Skeptical reception A study in the British Medical Journal (Rose, 1954) investigated spiritual healing, therapeutic touch and faith healing. In a hundred cases that were investigated, no single case revealed that the healer's intervention alone resulted in any improvement or cure of a measurable organic disability.Louis Rose. (1954). Some Aspects of Paranormal Healing. The British Medical Journal. Volume 2, No. 4900. pp. 1329–1332. Edwards claimed he had cured about a hundred thousand people in Britain but Rose could not verify a single cure by Edwards. Rose visited a healing session held by Edwards and observed that an old lady had claimed to have been cured during the session and had walked without her sticks, but by the time the session was over was walking with two sticks out of the hall.John Sladek.

Set in New York City and starring Pau Masó, Anatoli Grek, Josh Berresford, Samantha Glovin, and Keith Dougherty, the film tells the story of a Russian boy in Manhattan who, after losing his mother to suicide, is drawn into becoming a male prostitute. Premise Aleksandr's Price is an exploration of American youth in New York City and the excessive use of alcohol and other drugs in the gay community. Aleksandr Ivanov, played by Masó, falls into the dark business of prostitution after the loss of his family, which causes him to develop dissociative identity disorder. Cast * Pau Masó as Aleksandr * Anatoli Grek as Dr. Mary * Josh Berresford as Keith * Samantha Glovin as Emma * Keith Dougherty as Tom Production Aleksandr's Price was shot over a period of 25 days in March 2012 in New York City.

Release Prior to public release, Aleksandr's Price screened at the Philadelphia QFest on July 12, 2013. The film officially premiered on September 24, 2013. =Critical reception= The film has received mixed reviews. In September 2013, Victoria Alexander from \\"Las Vegas Informer\\" compared the film to Steve McQueen's 2011 film Shame stating: \\"Aleksandr’s Price can be viewed as a gay companion to Steve McQueen's Shame, which also dealt with sexual promiscuity in New York City\\". She also stated the film depicted prostitution very well, saying: \\"Aleksandr’s Price is a gay- themed movie, its depiction of the cruel and shallow world of New York City and its commerce in young men and women of all sexual orientations is spot on\\". DVD Beaver said: \\"If Black Swan were a film about a male escort rather than a ballerina (and had a dash of Requiem for a Dream thrown in), it would probably be something like \\"Aleksandr's Price\\" (although a bit more relentless, much more overblown, and without the hint of hopeful optimism). Accolades Aleksandr's Price had its Austrian premiere on November 10, 2014, at the \\"Internationale Queere Migrantische Filmtage\\" (Eng.

He was an activist in the democratic anti-communist opposition during the period of the People's Republic of Poland. Biography During the March 1968 events he participated in a student strike at the Warsaw Polytechnic, and was subsequently expelled from the university. Between 1967 and 1972 he belonged to the Polish Students' Association (ZSP). In 1974 he graduated from the Department of Chemistry of the University of Warsaw and then worked at the Institute for Nuclear Research (IBJ). In June 1976 Chojecki was one of the participants in the campaign to help the repressed workers of Ursus and Radom. As a result he was dismissed from his position at the institute and went on trial along with Bogdan Grzesiak, and two printers from the Polish Trade Agency, Jerzy Ciechomski and Wiesfaw Kunikowski on June 12, 1976. In the same year he was among the organizers of the Workers' Defence Committee (KOR). He initiated independent publishing activity and was responsible for the reproduction of the KOR Communications and Information Bulletin of the KOR underground newspapers. In September 1977 Chojecki created the Independent Publishing House \\"NOWa\\" which constituted the largest publishing house operating outside official communist censorship, becoming its leader. Initially, Chojecki wanted NOWa to publish historical books on topics officially forbidden or ignored by the communist authorities, but other oppositionists convinced him to also issue works of literature, including those by Czesław Miłosz and Günter Grass. When Chojecki was arrested by the communist secret police Grass signed a petition demanding his freedom. Along with Czesław Bielecki of CDN, Chojecki was one of the most important publishers collaborating with Kultura, the Polish emigre journal in Paris ran by Jerzy Giedroyc. In March 1980 he was detained, and then went on a hunger strike which ended up lasting 33 days. In May of that year, the parson of St. Christopher's Church in Podkowa Leśna led another hunger strike to protest Chojecki's and others political imprisonment. This protest was joined by more than twenty members of the democratic anti-communist opposition, including Jacek Kuroń, Bronisław Wildstein, Aleksander Hall, Jan Józef Lipski as well the Hungarian oppositionist and publisher Tibor Pakh. After a trial Chojecki was sentenced to one and a half years imprisonment with a conditional suspension. In August 1980 he organized the printing of publications of the \\"second circuit\\" (as underground press was known in Poland at the time). He was re-arrested but was released after the signing of the Gdańsk Agreement between the communist government and striking workers of Gdańsk, which led to the creation of the Solidarity Trade Union. Chojecki was restored to his job at the Institute for Nuclear Research as well. In the same year he became a member of \\"Solidarity\\". In October 1981 he went abroad and was in France when the imposition of martial law in Poland by the government of General Wojciech Jaruzelski occurred. He remained in exile in Paris and published a monthly \\"Kontakt\\", produced films on modern Polish history, and organized support for the underground in Poland, including the provision of media equipment and other hardware. He continued to collaborate with Jerzy Giedroyc during this period. Chojecki returned to Poland in 1990. He co-founded the first commercial television station NTW (\\"Nowa Telewizja Warszawa\\", New Television Warsaw), started a film group \\"Kontakt\\" and served as adviser to the minister of culture. In 2004, Mirosław Chojecki initiated and as director leads the Warsaw-based Jewish Motifs International Film Festival. He is the initiator and the honorary president of the Association for Free Speech (Stowarzyszenie Wolnego Słowa). He is also a member of the Civic Committee of the Solidarity with Ukraine (KOSzU). In 2005 he was an honorary committee member for Donald Tusk during the presidential campaign. On August 31, 2006 Chojecki was awarded the Commander's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta by President Lech Kaczynski.

It replaced the Dash 8 Series in the mid-1990s, and was superseded by the Evolution Series in the mid-2000s. Dash 9 series locomotives are some of the most common in the United States. Specifications The Dash 9 Series is an improved version of the Dash 8 Series. Like that earlier Series, it has a microprocessor-equipped engine control unit, and a modular system of construction of the vehicle body. All models of the Dash 9 Series are powered by a 16-cylinder, turbocharged, GE 7FDL 4-stroke diesel engine, with electronic fuel injection and split cooling. Dash 9 Series locomotives also ride on HiAd high adhesion trucks, with low weight transfer characteristics and microprocessor controlled wheelslip.  Six axle models  = Common feature = A specification common to all Dash 9 Series six axle models is the AAR wheel arrangement known as C-C = C40-9 = NS C40-9 # 8801. This version of the Dash 9 was manufactured between January and March 1995. All 125 examples of this model are owned by the Norfolk Southern Railway. The C40-9 is the only model in the Dash 9 Series to feature the standard cab design. All were built with rooftop-mounted air conditioners which gives them a rather unusual and distinctive look - and were quickly coined \\"top hats\\" by the railfan community. Other than the standard cab, the model is identical in all specifications to the wide-nose \\"North American\\" safety cab Dash 9-40CW (or C40-9W) model (see below). NS specifically requested the standard cab, and may have purchased more units had the Federal Railroad Administration not required it to purchase the wide-nose C40-9W version instead. Besides, standard cab GE's had become more expensive by the mid-1990s, since they were now considered optional equipment by the builder, and thus priced as such, and when a carrier is purchasing one or two hundred units of a particular model at a time, even a slight extra price for a customized cab can add hundreds of thousands of dollars to the cost of a locomotive order. In 2015, the railroad announced the locomotives would be given a new wide cab, A.C. traction motors, cab signals, LSL and uprated to 4400 HP. The new locomotives will be designated as AC44C6M. The last of the \\"top hats\\" were rebuilt to AC44C6M's in November 2018. * Power output: = C40-9W = NS C40-9W # 9258. All 1,090 units of this model were built for the Norfolk Southern Railway, as road numbers 8889 to 9978. The orders for these units were basically an extension of NS's previous order for the standard cab Dash 9-40C (or C40-9) (see above). They were built under the same premise that a lower power rating than the rating of the Dash 9-44CW (or C44-9W) (see below) would prolong the life of the engine, and use less fuel. However, there is a manual override switch that allows the engineer to run the engine with all if necessary. As with the C40-9, Norfolk Southern began to upgrade their C40-9W's from 4,000 to 4,400 hp and AC traction in mid-2015, making them AC44C6M's as well. Others will be rebuilt as the AC44C6CF. * Power output: = C44-9W = Hamersley Iron C44-9W # 7072 at the Brockman 4 mine. The C44-9W model was in production between 1993 and 2004 with 53 pre-production units being built for CSX with an extended Dash 8 carbody and trucks a couple years earlier. Of all the Dash 9 Series models, this one received by far the greatest number of orders. A total of 1,697 orders for C44-9W's were received from Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and successor BNSF Railway (known at the time as the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway). Other large orders from North American operators were placed by Canadian National Railway and a number of operators that have since been absorbed by the present day Union Pacific Railroad, including Chicago and Northwestern and Southern Pacific. Substantial orders for this model were also received from operators in Australia and Brazil, in the latter case for broad gauge versions. General Electric and Norfolk Southern agreed to rebuild 450 of these C44-9W's, making them AC44C6M's along with their C40-9's and C40-9W's. Norfolk Southern is essentially converting all of their Dash 9 units into AC44C6M's. * Power output: = C-38AChe = China Railway NJ2 0053. The C-38AChe, also known as the NJ2, is operated by China Railway. Built in Erie, Pennsylvania, it is based on a standard Dash 9-44CW (or C44-9W) (see above) and marketed as the GE C38AChe. The model was specially customised for high altitude operation on the Qinghai-Tibet Railway route. It is used on the Qingzang Railway, which connects Xining, Qinghai Province, to Lhasa, Tibet Autonomous Region, in the People's Republic of China. * Power output: Eight axle model = DASH 9-40BBW = This is a (meter gauge) version of the C40-9W. It was manufactured between 1997 and 2006. All 141 examples of the model are owned by the Estrada de Ferro Vitória a MinasSee :pt:Estrada de Ferro Vitória a Minas . (EFVM), a railroad in Brazil. The model is equipped with four B-style trucks, two at each end, replacing the conventional C-style trucks. The different trucks are necessary due to the railroad load limit per axle, which is 25 metric tons (±55,156 lbs). The standard C40-9W traction motors cannot fit in the narrower trucks. To achieve the same total power, more of the smaller traction motors are needed. * Power output: See also *List of GE locomotives *NR class locomotives  References  = Notes = = Bibliography =    External links  * GE Transportation Systems.

The presence of one Y chromosome with a functioning SRY gene causes the expression of genes that determine maleness. Because of this, XXXY syndrome only affects males. The additional two X chromosomes in males with XXXY syndrome causes them to have 48 chromosomes, instead of the typical 46. XXXY syndrome is therefore often referred to as 48,XXXY. There is a wide variety of symptoms associated with this syndrome, including cognitive and behavioral problems, taurodontism, and infertility. This syndrome is usually inherited via a new mutation in one of the parents’ gametes, as those affected by it are usually infertile. It is estimated that XXXY affects one in every 50,000 male births.  Signs and symptoms  The symptoms of 48,XXXY syndrome are similar to those of Klinefelter syndrome, though the symptoms are usually more severe in 48,XXXY syndrome. Like Klinefelter syndrome, the presence of additional X chromosomes affects the male reproductive system, can cause physical abnormalities, and can affect cognitive development. When comparing 47,XXY and 48,XXXY, there is a greater risk for congenetial malformations and more medical problems in those with 48,XXXY. = Reproductive = Those with XXXY syndrome can have testicular dysgenesis and hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism. Testicular dygenesis is a condition in which a male has incomplete or complete loss of spermatogenesis, so that the individual produces very low levels, or no sperm. This results in infertility of that individual. Hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism is a condition in which the function of the testes in males is reduced and can result in low levels of sex steroids produced like testosterone. = Physical = Males with 48,XXXY can have average or tall stature, which becomes more prominent in adulthood. Facial dysmorphism is common in males with 48,XXXY and can include increased distance between the eyes (hypertelorism), skin folds of the upper eyelid (epicanthal folds), up-slanting opening between the eyelids (palpebral fissures) and hooded eyelids. Other physical features include the fifth finger or \\"pinkie\\" to be bent inwards towards the fourth finger (clinodactyly), short nail beds, flat feet, double jointedness (hyperextensibility) and prominent elbows with cubitus varus where the arm rests closer to the body. Musculoskeletal features may include congentical elbow dislocation and the limited ability of the feet to roll inwards while walking and upon landing. Micropenis is another common symptom of this syndrome. Individuals affected with XXXY are also prone to developing Taurodontism, which often presents early in life, and can be an early indicator of XXY syndrome. Those with this syndrome are also prone to hip dysplasia, and other joint abnormalities. An individual’s symptoms vary due to differing androgen deficiencies, and also with alter with age. Prepubescent boys with XXXY syndrome may not differ in physical appearance from a child without the syndrome. This is likely because androgen levels do not differ among pre-pubescent boys, but a difference does arise as puberty progresses. Those with XXXY syndrome may also experience feminine distribution of adipose tissue, and gynecomastia may also be present. Tall stature is more likely to appear in adolescence, when androgen levels begin to differ between those with XXXY syndrome and those that do not have it. = Cognitive and developmental = Neurological effects are believed to be more severe as the number of extra X chromosomes increases; a male with 48,XXXY is likely to have more severe symptoms than a male with Klinefelter syndrome. Developmental delays are common in infancy and childhood. Expected symptoms include speech delays, motor delays, and hypotonia (lack of muscle tone), also known as floppy baby syndrome. Individuals with XXXY syndrome exhibit cognitive and behavioral problems. Patients typically show altered adaptive behavior, which is the ability of an individual to demonstrate essential living skills, including: social skills, community living, safety, functional use of academic skills and self-care. People with XXXY syndrome were found to score significantly less in the domains of daily living skills and communication compared to XXYY, and XXY individuals. This means that they typically demonstrate little ability in the domains of self-care, social skills, safety, application of academic skills, and responsibility. Individuals with this syndrome also experience emotional symptoms such as anxiety symptoms, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, behavioral dysregulational and emotional immaturity. People with this syndrome typically have an IQ in the range of 40-60, where the average IQ range is 95-110.http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1985-19822-001 They also experience language-based learning disabilities that can affect their communication with others. Those with XXXY syndrome tend to display less externalizing and internalizing behaviors compared to those with 48,XXYY syndrome, which may have a positive effect on their social functioning. These individuals may also have increased vulnerability for autistic features. Changes in testosterone as well as androgen deficits may contribute to these individuals’ social behaviors that put them at increased risk for autistic features.  Cause  The cause of 48,XXXY can be from non-disjunction in the paternal sperm or non- disjunction in the maternal oocyte. The most likely scenario for the existence of this aneuploidy is that each party (maternal and paternal) equally contributed to it, by the egg giving an XX and the sperm giving an XY. In the case where the sperm is the genetic cause of 48,XXXY syndrome, the sperm would have to contain two X chromosomes and one Y chromosome. This would be caused by two non-disjunction events in spermatogenesis, both meosis I and meiosis II. The duplicated X chromosome in the sperm would have to fail to separate in both meiosis I and meiosis II for a sperm as well as the X and Y chromosomes would have to be in the same sperm. Then the XXY sperm would fertilize a normal oocyte to make a XXXY zygote. In the case where the oocyte is the genetic cause of 48,XXXY syndrome the oocyte would contain three X chromosome. This would be caused by two non-disjunction events during oogenesis. In meiosis I both sets of duplicated X chromosomes would have to be not separated. Then in meiosis II one set of X chromosomes would have to not separate and the other set would separate resulting in one oocyte with three X chromosomes. A normal sperm containing a Y chromosome would have to fertilize the XXX oocyte to make a XXXY zygote. = Mechanism = The additional X chromosomes that are characteristic of this condition are associated with an androgen deficiency. This causes reduced or absent feedback inhibition of the pituitary gland, by elevating the gonadotropin levels.  Diagnosis  Karyotype of 47,XXY. The only difference for 48,XXXY would be a third X chromosome. Diagnosis of 48,XXXY is usually done by a standard karyotype. A karyotype is a chromosomal analysis in which a full set of chromosomes can be seen for an individual. The presence of the additional 2 X chromosomes on the karyotype are indicative of XXXY syndrome. Another way to diagnosis 48,XXXY is by chromosomal microarray showing the presence of extra X chromosomes. Chromosomal microarray (CMA) is used to detect extra or missing chromosomal segments or whole chromosomes. CMA uses microchip-based testing to analyze many pieces of DNA. Males with 48,XXXY are diagnosed anywhere from before birth to adulthood as a result of the range in the severity of symptoms. The age range at diagnosis is likely due to the fact that XXXY is a rare syndrome, and does not cause as extreme phenotypes as other variants of Klinefelter syndrome (such as XXXXY). Diagnostic testing could also be done via blood samples. Elevated levels of follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and low levels of testosterone can be indicative of this syndrome. Management = Treatment = Treatments exist for the various symptoms associated with XXXY syndrome. Testosterone therapy, which is giving affected individuals doses of testosterone on a regular basis, has been shown to reduce aggressive behavior in these patients. But, this therapy has also been associated with negative side effects: worsening of behavior, and osteoporosis. Not all individuals are applicable for testosterone therapy, as the best results are often achieved when dosage begins at the initiation of puberty, and these individuals are often diagnosed at a later age, or not at all. Testosterone therapy has been shown to have no positive effect on fertility. Consideration of the psychological phenotype of individuals with XXXY should be taken into account when treating these patients, because these traits affect compliance with treatments. When caught early, Taurodontism can be treated with a root canal and is often successful. Appropriate planning to avoid Taurodontism is possible, but this syndrome must be diagnosed early, which is not common. Taurodontism can often be detected as a symptom of XXXY syndrome before other characteristics develop, and can be an early indicator for it. Surgical treatments to correct joint problems, such as hip dysplasia are common, and are often successful alongside physiotherapy. Those with XXXY syndrome can also attend speech therapy. This form of therapy helps patients to understand and produce more complex language. Those with XXXY syndrome tend to experience more severe speech delays, so this form of treatment can be very beneficial to them, and can help them to communicate better with other people. Since hypotonia is common in those with this syndrome, physical therapy can also be helpful. This form of therapy may help these individuals develop muscle tone, and increase balance and coordination. = Quality of life = In mild cases, individuals with XXXY syndrome may lead a relatively good life. These individuals may face difficulties in communicating with others due to their language-based deficits. These deficits may make forming bonds with others difficult, but fulfilling relationships with others are still achievable. Those with higher scores in adaptive functioning are likely to have higher quality of life because they can be independent. = Genetic counselling = As the syndrome is due to a chromosomal non-disjunction event, the recurrence risk is not high compared to the general population. There has been no evidence found that indicates non-disjunction occurs more often in a particular family.

The resolution is titled \\"43/176. Question of Palestine\\".UNGA Resolution \\"43/176. Question of Palestine\\" . 15 December 1988 (doc.nr. A/RES/43/176). The number of the draft is A/43/L.53. The peace conference was proposed in the framework of international politics. The international community supported the International Peace Conference, with only Israel and the United States opposing it. Israel and US insisted on bilateral negotiations instead. The resolution affirms principles for the achievement of comprehensive peace: withdrawal of Israel from the occupied Palestinian territories, including Jerusalem, and from the other occupied Arab territories; security of all States in the region, including those named in resolution 181, within secure and internationally recognized boundaries; execution of Resolution 194; dismantling of the Israeli settlements; and free access to Holy Places. In the same meeting Resolution 43/177 was adopted, in which the proclamation of the State of Palestine was acknowledged and the occupied Palestinian territories were called territories over which the Palestinian people should exercise sovereignty. The resolutions 43/176 and 43/177 were broadly supported by NGO's all over the world.General Assembly, Report of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People , Annexes II-VII. 17 November 1989.

UN doc.nrs. A/43/827 and S/20278 (18 November 1988) The Political Communiqué, in which the PLO affirmed its commitment to the UN and its resolutions and reaffirmed its rejection of terrorism in all its forms, drew much positive international attention. The Political Communiqué also included a proposal to place the occupied Palestinian territories temporarily under supervisision of the UN, as noted in paragraph 4 of the resolution. In a press conference on 14 December, Arafat emphasized the PLO's endorsement of Resolution 181 as the basis for Palestinian independence and Resolutions 242 and 338 as the basis for negotiations with Israel within the framework of an international conference. Arafat also affirmed the PLO's position, that Israel has the right to exist in peace and security and the absolute renouncement of all forms of terrorism.Associated Press, Text Of Arafat's Opening Statement At News Conference With AM-UN-PLO, Bjt. 14 December 1988.

Votes The resolution was adopted with 138 votes in favour and 2 abstentions. Israel and the United States were the only states that voted against the resolution. Israel's objections Israel especially objected to paragraph 3, which affirms the principle of ending Israel's occupation, complete withdrawal and application of Resolution 194 regarding the Palestinian refugees. Israel also objected to the participation in the International Conference of the PLO, which was not acknowledged by Israel as the representative of the Palestinians, at the time. Israel argued that the conference would substitute, rather than support direct negotiations.UNGA/UNSC, 16 November 1989, Report of the Secretary-General, par. 4 (doc.nrs.

Another report said they hoped to make \\"six or eight five reelers\\" over twelve months. One hundred shares were offered at £1 a share. Their first picture was to be The Black Opal but this does not seem to have been made. They offered cash for Australian stories. According to Raymond Longford, they initially secured the serves of American director, Mr Walter May Plank, but he left Australia and Longford was called in instead.Merv Wasson, \\"The Woman Suffers: Why Ever Was She Banned?\\", Cinema Papers, July 1984 p158-160 Their first feature was the successful The Woman Suffers (1918). which was followed by The Sentimental Bloke. In 1920 the company paid out a dividend of a shilling per share. The company was a subscriber to Carroll-Baker Australian Productions, which made movies starring Snowy Baker, and had a five-twelfths interest in Southern Cross Picture Productions. Southern Cross Picture Productions Ltd was incorporated in 1920 with a value of £37,600 and directors including E. J. Carroll, Snowy Baker and D. Gordon. The company was at its peak in 1921 with the successful release of The Sentimental Bloke and Ginger Mick. In 1923 there was a trial involving a man who falsely pretended to be from the company to abduct a young woman. In 1925, E. J. Carroll suggested the company make a film adaptation of C. J. Dennis's The Rose of Spadgers at £1,000-£2,000 but after consideration the company directors elected not to do this. By that stage the company was reporting consistent losses, due in part to its inability to recoup costs incurred in Great Britain and the US. It appears to have wound up shortly afterwards.

Nucleotide excision repair is a major pathway for repairing UV light-induced DNA damage in most organisms. The function of this protein is to aid transcription. Structure These proteins have a structural motif consisting of a 2-layer sandwich structure with an alpha/beta plait topology. TFIIH Transcription/repair factor IIH (TFIIH) is essential for RNA polymerase II transcription and nucleotide excision repair. The TFIIH complex consists of ten subunits: * ERCC2, * ERCC3, * GTF2H1, * GTF2H2, * GTF2H3, * GTF2H4, * GTF2H5, * MNAT1, * CDK7 and * CCNH. TTDA is also required for the stability of the TFIIH complex and for the presence of normal levels of TFIIH in the cell. TFIIH is one of five general transcription factors (GTFs) that assemble with RNA polymerase IIat a promoter site prior to the initiation of transcription. It is one of ten subunits that complete part of the 10 subunit protein complex (holoTFIIH) and part of a six- subunit complex of Rad3, Tfb1, Tfb2, Tfb4, Tfb5, and Ssl1 (referred to as core) Function In humans, the function of Tbf5 is clear, as loss of it leads to trichothiosystropy. Defects in GTF2H5 cause the disease trichothiodystrophy (TTD), therefore GTF2H5 (general transcription factor 2H subunit 5) is also known as the TTD group A (TTDA) subunit (and as Tfb5). The TTDA subunit is responsible for the DNA repair function of the complex. TTDA is present both bound to TFIIH, and as a free fraction that shuffles between the cytoplasm and nucleus; induction of NER-type DNA lesions shifts the balance towards TTDA's more stable association with TFIIH. REX1, which is short for, required for excision 1, is required for DNA repair in the single- celled, photosynthetic algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and has homologues in other eukaryotes.

The service is offered in freeware, subscription, and enterprise versions. The conditional chains are called applets. An applet may for example send an e-mail message if the user tweets using a hashtag, or copy a photo on Facebook to a user's archive if someone tags a user in a photo. In addition to the web-based application, the service runs on iOS and Android. In February 2015, IFTTT renamed its original application to IF, and released a new suite of apps called Do, with which users can create shortcut applications and actions. As of 2015, IFTTT users created about 20 million recipes each day. All of the functionalities of the Do suite of apps have since been integrated into a redesigned IFTTT app.  History  On December 14, 2010, Linden Tibbets, the co-founder of IFTTT, posted a blog post titled “ifttt the beginning...” on the IFTTT website, announcing the new project. The first IFTTT applications were designed and developed by Tibbets and co-founder Jesse Tane. On September 7, 2011, Tibbets announced the launch on the official website. By April 30, 2012, users had created 1 million tasks. In June 2012, the service entered the Internet of Things space by integrating with Belkin Wemo devices, allowing applets to interact with the physical world. On July 10, 2013, IFTTT released an iPhone app and later released a version for iPad and iPod touch. On April 24, 2014, IFTTT released a version for Android. By the end of 2014, the IFTTT business was valued at approximately USD 170 million. On February 19, 2015, IFTTT launched three new applications. Do Button triggers an action when you press it. Do Camera automatically uploads the image to the service of your choice (Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox, etc.). Do Notes does the same as Do Camera except with notes instead of images. As of November 2016, the four apps have been combined into one. By December 2016, the company announced a partnership with JotForm to integrate an applet to create actions in other applications. Part of the revenue of IFTTT comes from \\"IFTTT Platform\\" partners, who pay to have their products connected to the service. On September 10, 2020, the service switched to a limited freemium model with a subscription-based version known as \\"IFTTT Pro\\", which allows services to use conditional statements and query data for more complex tasks. At the same time, all existing users were limited to three custom applets, being required to subscribe to Pro in order to remove this limitation. This generated criticism from its users due to this paywall.  Features  = Overview = Screenshot of the IFTTT website IFTTT employs the following concepts: * Services (formerly known as channels) are the basic building blocks of IFTTT. They mainly describe a series of data from a certain web service such as YouTube or eBay. Services can also describe actions controlled with certain APIs, like SMS. Sometimes, they can represent information in terms of weather or stocks. Each service has a particular set of triggers and actions. * Triggers are the \\"this\\" part of an applet.

It has a heritage-listed entrance building. The station is classified by Deutsche Bahn (DB) as a category 5 station. Only Regionalbahn services stop at the 3 platform tracks (only tracks 1 and 2 are used regularly). History The location of the station in the Bensheim district of Auerbach The platforms of Bensheim-Auerbach station The station was opened in 1850 along on the Main- Neckar Railway, which was opened in 1846 between Frankfurt and Heidelberg. The plans for the entrance building were probably drawn up by the Darmstadt court architect Georg Moller. The station is a two-storey building, originally containing railway residential and administrative spaces. It features a gable roof covered with a low pitched roof. Beneath the eaves there are small mezzanine windows. The station has three lines of windows built of yellow sandstone. The southern gable is clad in timber. On the trackside toward the roof there are cast iron columns, which were probably made in 1846. On the southwest side a small signal box house was built in 1920. There is architectural evidence that it was designed by Heinrich Metzendorf. Infrastructure The station is classified as a category 5 station. In December 2007, DB announced that it intended to sell the station building and shortly later that it had sold it to an investor. The station is an increasingly important transport hub for the region and it is included in the overall concept for Hessentag 2014, which is being celebrated in Bensheim. There are also proposals to include it on a new line of the Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn. Work has therefore been under way since April 2012 to fully rehabilitate it. Operations Regionalbahn service in Bensheim-Auerbacher station on its way to Heidelberg Hauptbahnhof The trains is served by the RB 68 Regionalbahn (stopping) service on the Heidelberg Hbf–Weinheim (Bergstr)–Bensheim-Auerbach–Bensheim–Darmstadt Hbf–Frankfurt (Main) Hbf route.

Biography  J. Montserrat was born in 1932, in Barcelona. His education took place in Barcelona, Rome, Munster, Paris, and Benares. Due to his activism and writings in the Catalan Press regarding the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965) he was censured in the newspapers from 1966 to 1977. A teacher since 1954, the government denied him the \\"certificate of political good behavior\\" due to his anti-Francoist activism, and he was thus unable to continue in that profession. He received a Ph.D. in Theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome in 1968, and a second Ph.D. in Philosophy from the University of Barcelona in 1977. Since 1976 he has been professor of philosophy at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, where he became full professor in 1996 and professor emeritus in 2002. He is the coauthor of the Manifest of Bellaterra, 1975 and secretary of the Third Catalan University Congress, April 1978.

Originally aired on Lifetime, the film was written by Christine Conradt and Ken Sanders, and features Jamie Luner and Caitlin Thompson.  Plot  Set in the area of Los Angeles, the film focuses on 18-year-old high school senior student Casey Benson (Caitlin Thompson). When she publicly lashes out at her boyfriend Jeremy (Isiah Adams) for dumping her carelessly in public, she attracts the attention of the school's most popular girls, led by confident and attractive young Amber (Marie Avgeropoulos). Amber and her friends Taylor (Lindsay Taylor) and Kylie (Arden Cho) get her a fake ID, and take her to a nightclub. Little does Casey know that Amber and her friends work as high- profile call girls for the high school's police officer Jack (Matthew Alan). Without informing her that she is supposed to sleep with men in exchange for money, Amber sets Casey up with 28-year-old Max (Jason-Shane Scott). After getting drunk for the first time in her life, Casey spends the night with Max and gets into a fight with her mother Holly (Jamie Luner) after getting home after her curfew, intoxicated. Holly has been in an unhappy marriage with her adulterous husband Christopher (Al Sapienza), who cares little for his family's well-being. Even though her husband does not support her, Holly decides to open her own restaurant with friend Maggie (Darlene Vogel). The next day, when she receives $600 for having slept with Max, Casey is appalled that she was unknowingly working as a prostitute and immediately turns to Max to confront him with his agreements. Max tries to calm her down, and assures Casey that he is just as interested in her, as she is in him. Later that day, Holly finds out that Christopher has lost all of the family savings on a bad investment, as well as that he is having an affair. She decides to file for divorce and confronts him with the actions, which leads to a violent fight that culminates with Christopher slapping Holly. Despite his immediate regret for the act, Holly flees the house and reports Christopher to the police, leading to his arrest. Casey is shocked by her family situation and blames her mother for not having tried hard enough to make her marriage work. She then reconciles with Amber and heads out to a nightclub to get drunk. There, she is offered $1200 if she sleeps with a wealthy man in his forties. Even though she does not feel attracted to him, she takes Amber up on the deal. The next day, Holly finds out that Casey has a lot of money, and snoops in her room for clues. When Casey finds out, she decides to move out, and temporarily seeks refuge at Amber's. There, she is convinced to have a threesome with a high roller for $5,000. When they arrive at the high roller's house, he reveals himself to be a very old man. Casey wants to leave, but Amber reminds her of the money and offers her a drug. Casey refuses and complains how ugly and disgusting their client is, her complaints are overheard by the client. After a cocktail, the old man requests both girls to sit next to him on the couch to which they comply awkwardly. He first whispers to Amber to do a sexual act which she reluctantly complies. However, when he requests Casey to do a sexual act, she refuses and runs out of the house. Jack beats her up and forces her back in. Casey is eventually able to flee the scene, but is fired on the spot. She returns to her mother in tears, and admits to having worked as a prostitute. Holly rushes to the school to ask for a transfer, and when she explains the situation, Jack receives notice that his prostitution ring might soon be out on the open. To prevent this from happening, he and Amber (whom he forces to be his accomplice) take the Bensons hostage. Jack plans to kill the family and stage it to look like a murder-suicide, but - with Amber's help - Holly and Casey are able to escape, and Holly eventually shoots and kills Jack. In a voice-over, Casey explains that she finished school and then went to college. Amber left town and was never heard from again. Holly and Christopher made peace with each other, easing their divorce. The movie ends with Taylor and Kylie confronting Casey at school, obviously mad at her for exposing the ring. They ask if she's happy now, and Casey confidently says that she is. Taylor and Kylie then walk away and Casey is comforted by her best friend.

Background During 1934 and early 1935, all feature films released in the Dutch East Indies had been directed by The Teng Chun, based on Chinese mythology or martial arts, and targeted at low-class audiences, generally ethnic Chinese. This situation was created by the Great Depression, which had led to the Dutch East Indies government collecting higher taxes, advertisers asking for more money, and cinemas selling tickets at lower prices; this ensured that there was a very low profit margin for local films. During this period cinemas in the country mainly showed Hollywood productions. History Java Pacific Film was founded in 1934 in Bandoeng, in what was then the Dutch East Indies, by Dutch-Indonesian journalist Albert Balink working with the Wong brothers. Balink, who intended to target high- class audiences, had found financial support for the new company, took control, while the Wongs brought a studio and film equipment to the endeavour. The studio, an old tapioca flour factory, featured simple film editing equipment, several buildings to serve as living quarters for the employees, and a veranda surrounded by trees used for editing. The smokestack had the company's initials, JPF, in large letters. Their first production was a documentary about Mount Merapi, entitled De Merapi Dreight (Mount Merapi Looms), in 1934. Dutch filmmaker Mannus Franken was brought to the country in 1934 to help make the movie Pareh between 1934 and 1936. Franken had previously had success with documentary filmmaking in the Netherlands. The production cost 75,000 gulden, with its star Rd. Mochtar receiving 250 gulden monthly. A commercial flop which bankrupted the producers and company, Pareh is credited with shifting the focus of Indonesian cinema from Chinese productions and subject matter to a more local industry. The film is also praised for its cinematic quality. and its audio. Successor Balink collected funds from numerous sponsors and established the Dutch Indies Film Syndicate (, or ANIF) in late 1936. This government-owned company involved all major figures from JPF. Working mostly on newsreels and documentaries, in 1937 it produced the commercial success Terang Boelan. In 1938 it released Franken's documentary Tanah Sabrang and in 1940 closed.

Early life and education Francisco Salva Campillo was born in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, on July 12, 1751. He was the son of Dr. Jerome Salvà Pontich, a Staff Physician at Barcelona General Hospital and Eulalia Campillo, his mother came from a wealthy family that worked in the pharmacy industry. During his adolescence, his extraordinary abilities attracted the attention of the Bishop of Barcelona, Josep Climent, who advised his parents to let him study medicine in Valencia. He studied at the University of Valencia, where he completed his course in three years instead of the usual four. In 1771, he successfully passed the B.Phil. degree in Medicine from the University of Huesca, Spain. He later earned his doctorate in medicine at the University of Toulouse. Medical career He started a medical school in Barcelona in an effort to train more doctors and took a special interest in vaccination, particularly against the disease of smallpox. He received several awards from the Paris Society of Medicine. In 1773, he became, along with Vincent Mitjavila, one of the founding teachers of the Academy of Medical Practice, which is now part of the University of Barcelona (Universitat de Barcelona), Faculty of Medicine. This school was founded in an attempt to unite the two disciplines of clinical and non-clinical studies into a ‘united faculty'. Telegraphy In 1795, Dr. Salva presented at the Royal Academy of Sciences and Arts of Barcelona (Spanish: Real Academia de Ciencias y Artes de Barcelona) his first report devoted to \\"Electricity Applied to Telegraphy.\\" Salva demonstrated the basis of electric telegraphy, anticipating the wireless telegraph and undersea cables. The presentation of Salva attracted the attention of government and he received a formal invitation to demonstrate his telegraphic skills before the Royal Family in Aranjuez. Legacy Salva died on February 13, 1828. He left behind a massive library composed of more than five hundred thousand volumes on medical topics. Along with these works, he bequeathed to the Royal Academy of Medicine of Barcelona a sum of four thousand pounds and in accordance with his will, his heart is preserved in an urn, with his books at the same location. Artist Paul DeMarinis was inspired by Salva for his work The Messenger (1998–2006), which examines the myths of electricity in communication.

They are particularly effective against Gram-negative bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae and few Gram-positive bacteria such s Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. In 2000 a group of scientists from SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, UK reported that the antibiotic part of albomycin in vitro can inhibit seryl t-RNA synthetase from both eukaryotic and prokaryotic representatives. Structure Albomycins are naturally occurring sideromycins produced by some streptomycetes. The siderophore part of albomycin δ2 is similar to ferrichrome. It contains three molecules of δ-N-hydroxy-δ-N-acetyl ornithine linked to a serine, all by peptide linkage. The C-terminus of the serine is linked to another serine attached to the antibiotically active 4’-thio (N4-carbamoyl-3-methyl) cytidine moiety. The trihydroxamate part serves the siderophore function as it can trap Fe+3 and is essential for active transport of the antibiotic.

When converted to the western calendar using the traditional Varronian chronology this year becomes 342 BC. However modern historians have shown that the Varronian chronology dates the mutiny four years too early due to inclusion of unhistorical \\"dictator years\\". Despite this known inaccuracy, the Varronian chronology remains in use by convention also in current academic literature. Forsythe(2005), pp. 369-370 According to the most well-known version, the mutiny originated in a group of Roman garrison soldiers wintering in Campania to protect the cities there against the Samnites. Subverted by the luxurious living of the Campanians, these soldiers conspired to take over their host cities. When the conspiracy was discovered, the conspirators formed a rebel army and marched against Rome. They were met by an army commanded by Marcus Valerius Corvus who had been nominated dictator to solve the crisis. Rather than do battle, Corvus managed to end the mutiny by peaceful means. All the mutineers received amnesty for their part in the rebellion and a series of laws were passed to address their political grievances. All preserved accounts of the mutiny were however written several hundred years after the events they describe. Modern historians have found many elements in the classical accounts resembling the civil strife of the Late Republic which they consider anachronistic to the Roman Republic of the late 4th century BC. Some even believe the mutiny to be entirely invented by writers wishing to provide a context for the important political reforms they knew had been legislated in 342 BC. Classical accounts The most the extensive description of the mutiny, that has been preserved, is provided by Livy (59 BC - 17 AD), who makes it the closing episode of the Seventh Book of his history of Rome, Ab Urbe Condita. Livy knew of two conflicting accounts of the mutiny, descriptions of the first has been preserved in fragments of two other authors. A fragment of Dionysius of Halicarnassus's (c. 60 BC – after 7 BC) Roman Antiquities provides an elaborate description of the first half of the mutiny, but then breaks off. Another complete, but more summarily, account is preserved in a fragment from Appian's (c. 95 AD – c. 165 AD)Roman History. Similarities in wording makes it probable that Appian used Dionysius as his source.Oakley(1998), p. 362 =First version, conspiracy at Capua= The backdrop of the first version is the First Samnite War which had broken out in 343 when Rome came to the aid of Capua and the Campanians against the Samnites. According to the ancient writers the Roman consul Marcus Valerius Corvus during that year campaigned in Campania and won two battles against the Samnites, at the Battle of Mount Gaurus and the Battle of Suessula.Livy, vii.32.2-33.18, vii.37.4-17 At the end of the campaign season the people of Suessula and Capua requested garrisons from Rome to defend them against the Samnites during the winter.Livy, vii.38.4; D.H. xv.3.2; App. Samn. 1 According to Dionysius, the Roman senate authorized Marcus Valerius to organize the garrisons, as large as the host cities wished to support. Valerius filled the garrisons with men who wished to stay and receive army rations and pay, mostly these were poor and homeless debt-ridden men.D.H. xv.3.2-3 However the opulent decadence of Capua soon started to undermine the morale and patriotism of the Roman troops sent there and they started planning how to make themselves masters of CapuaLivy, vii.38.5; D.H. xv.3.4-9; App. Samn. 1 The Romans elected Gaius Marcius Rutilus and Quintus Servilius Ahala as their consuls for 342. Campania was allotted Marcius, an experienced general and statesman who was now consul for the fourth time, and he discovered the conspiracy.Livy, vii.38.8; D.H. xv.3.10 Marcius caused a rumour to be spread that the troops would have the same winter quarters next year as well. Deprived of any sense of urgency the agitation died down.Livy, vii.38.9-10; D.H. xv.3.10-11 With the army settled into summer quarters, Marcius begun quietly to cleanse the army for mutinous elements. Some were discharged from service for having served their time or for disabilities, others were sent on furlough or transferred to serve elsewhere, all these were detained in Rome by the other consul and the praetor on various pretexts.Livy, vii.39.1-2; D.H. xv.3.12; App. Samn. 1 At first glad to visit their homes, those sent away grew suspicious when they realized they were not to rejoin the army and that the leading agitators appeared to have been singled out. Concluding that their conspiracy had been discovered, they started to fear they would soon suffer court martial and secret execution.Livy, vii.39.3-6; D.H. xv.3.13; App. Samn. 1 A cohort stationed at Anxur took up position at Lautulae where to intercept those men the consul was sending home.Livy, vii.39.7; D.H. xv.3.14-15; App. Samn. 1 According to Dionysius and Appian the mutineers also recruited prisoners to their cause.D.H. xv.3.15; App. Samn. 1 At this point the fragment of Dionysius breaks off. The army of the mutineers soon grew considerably in size, to about 20 000 men according to Appian.Livy, vii.39.8; App. Samn. 1 According to Livy they shifted their camp to below the hill of Alba Longa where they debated whom to offer leadership of their army. They decided upon Titus QuinctiusIt is possible this Titus Quinctius is identical to one of the many other T. Quinctii known from the 4th century, but he could also be a separate and otherwise unknown character. Oakley(1998), p. 374 who they learned was living in a villa nearby. This man came from a prominent patrician family, the Quinctia, and had had a distinguished military career, but a wound had made him lame in one foot and he had taken up a rural life far from Rome. Not expecting that he would accept leadership over them voluntarily, a party of the mutineers broke into Quinctius' house at night and carried him away to their camp where he was saluted as commander. On their own initiative the mutineers then broke camp and marched against Rome, only halting eight miles from the city when they learned that an army was marching against them, commanded by Marcus Valerius Corvus, who had been appointed Dictator with Lucius Aemilius Mamercus as Master of the HorseLivy, vii.39.8-17 Livy writes that as soon as the enemy army came into view, the mutineers, who had never experienced civil war, started having second thoughts and negotiations were started. In a speech to the mutineers Marcus Valerius recalled their past services together while Titus Quinctius urged them to entrust themselves to Valerius and his reputation for integrity and sympathy for the common soldiers.Livy, vii.40.1-19 The mutineers gave a shout of approval, whereupon Titus Quinctius urged Marcus Valerius to intervene on behalf of the mutineers and secure them from punishment.Livy, vii.41.1-2 Appian never mentions Titus Quinctius, possibly due to the briefness of his account.Oakley(1998), p. 362 According to him, the mutineers were met at the Alban mount about one day's march from Rome by the army of the Dictator, Marcus Valerius Corvus. Corvus was reluctant to engage the mutineers in battle and instead set up camp while he investigated the matter further. The men of the two armies started to mingle, the mutineers complaining that their rebellion had been caused by the heavy debts they were suffering under at Rome. Unwilling to start a civil war, Corvus convinced the Senate to decree a cancellation of debts to all Romans, and immunity to the rebels. The mutineers then laid down their arms and returned to Rome.App. Samn. 2 =Second version, mutiny in Rome= Livy also summarizes a second version found in some annalists he had consulted. According to these there was no dictator, the affair was entirely handled by the consuls and the mutiny broke out in Rome itself. At night the conspirators seized one Gaius ManliusA Gaius Manlius was Military Tribune with Consular power in 379, otherwise this name is unknown in this time period. Oakley(1998), p. 388 from his bed to be their leader and marched out to establish a fortified position four miles from the city. The consuls moved against them with another army, but when the battle lines drew close, rather than fight, the soldiers of both sides exchanged greetings, clasped hands and embraced each other. Seeing that the soldiers were not interested in fighting, the consuls put proposals of reconciliation to the senate.Livy, vii.42.3-7 Historicity of the mutiny Much of the detail provided in the first version is of questionable historical accuracy.Oakley(1998), p. 363 The first version with its focus on Campania follows smoothly from preceding events in the Samnite War, but it was not beyond ancient writers to invent such connections.Oakley(1998), p. 363 Moral corruption from luxurious living in Campania is a common theme in Roman historical writing.Forsythe(2005), p. 273 The plot to seize Capua is similar to the actions of the Mamertines at Messina.Forsythe(2005), p. 273 The abduction of Titus Quinctius from his villa resembles the famous legend of Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus being summoned from the plough to command Rome's army.Oakley(1998), p. 363, Forsythe(2005), p. 273 It is more likely that some authors, perhaps Valerius Antias, have invented a dictatorship for Valerius Corvus than that others have chosen to omit it.Oakley(1998), p. 363 The second version also has several problems. It was recorded in fewer sources and shares similarities with the sedition of Marcus Manlius Capitolinus.Oakley(1998), p. 363 There are other possible parallels as well. The centurion sent by Catiline to organize his conspiracy in Etruria in 63 BC was named Gaius Manlius. The story of how the consuls' and the mutineers' armies spontaneously made peace could be based on events in 83 BC when the army of consul Lucius Cornelius Scipio went over to Lucius Cornelius Sulla. If these two are true parallels, the second version of the mutiny must be a very late invention.Forsythe(2005), p. 273 It is possible then that both surviving versions of the mutiny have been invented by later annalists.Oakley(1998), p. 363 While most of the surviving narratives of the mutiny must probably be discarded as fiction, Oakley(1998) believes some kind of sedition actually took place in 342 which has later been embellished. All of Livy's sources recorded that a revolt took place, moreover some of the measures which according to Livy were passed in aftermath of the mutiny seems too obscure to have been invented out of nothing.Oakley(1998), pp. 363-364 Forsythe(2005) considers the mutiny a fiction invented by later Roman writers to provide context for the important laws that were passed this year.Forsythe(2005), p. 272 Political aftermath, the Leges Genuciae =Livy's account= According to Livy, Valerius brought forward a proposal granting immunity to all who had taken part in the secession during an assembly of the people at the Peteline Grove. A Lex Sacrata (\\"sacred law\\") that no one should be struck from the military list against his will was also passed, and furthermore a law that no one who had been military tribune could afterwards be centurion, this law was made due to one Publius Salonius,Otherwise unknown, Oakley(1998), p. 385 who had every year been either military tribune or first centurion, and that the cavalry should have their pay reduced for having acted against the mutineers.Livy, vii.41.3-8 Some of Livy's sources also stated that a tribune of the plebs, Lucius Genucius,Otherwise unknown, possibly a relation of the consul for 365 and 362, Lucius Genucius Aventinensis Oakley(1998), p. 385 secured the passage of laws declaring usury illegal, that no one could be reelected to the same office within less than ten years or hold more than one office at the same time, and that both consuls could be elected from the plebs.Livy, vii.42.1-2 In Livy's opinion, the mutiny must have been of considerable strength if they managed to extract all these concessions.Livy, vii.42.2 =Modern views= The Peteline Grove was also the location where Marcus Manlius was condemned, and is likely a fictional addition.Forsythe(2005), p. 274 It is unclear why the Romans needed a law protecting soldiers from involuntary delistment. Possibly the law was intended as a restriction on consular powers, especially if the consuls had used their powers arbitrarily to quell the mutiny.Oakley(1998), p. 383 it is unlikely that purpose of the law barring military tribunes from becoming centurions were intended to protect military tribunes from demotion since the military tribunate had been made elective in 362.Oakley(1998), p. 384 A possibility is that this law clearly defined the military tribune as outranking the centurion and ensured these two offices were held in ascending order.Forsythe(2005), p. 275 Another possibility is to accept the story of Publius Salonius as genuine. Perhaps already existing regulations had banned individuals from being military tribunes in consecutive years, but Salonius had broken these in spirit by repeated switches between first centurion and military tribune.Oakley(1998), p. 384 In later years military tribunes were usually young men of prominent families while centurion was the highest rank a commoner could aspire to after years of military service. This important social distinction might have been caused either accidentally or deliberately by this law.Forsythe(2005), p. 275 Notes References Bibliography History of the Roman Republic 342 BC 4th century BC in Italy 4th century BC in the Roman Republic Mutinies ","title":"Roman army mutiny in 342 BC"},{"id":"36533397","text":"SVRG can refer to: * Silicon Valley Roller Girls, a roller derby league from San Jose, California * Stuttgart Valley Rollergirlz, a roller derby league from Stuttgart in Germany * Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient, an optimization method ","title":"SVRG"},{"id":"36533403","text":"Tereza Čapková (; born 24 July 1987, in Příbram) is a Czech track and field athlete who will compete at the 2012 Summer Olympics.

Yalobusha Female Institute The college was established on November 30, 1850 by an act of the Mississippi state legislature and was named the Yalobusha Female Institute. Its first president was Dr. W. S. Webb, who served until 1857. Yalobusha was intended by Mississippi legislators to become the preeminent women's institution in the South and to draw students from throughout the region. It was given a budget that funded such amenities as the largest telescope in its surrounding states and a dormitory for 150 students. Enrollment began in 1851, with 77 students of various Christian denominations attending Yalobusha from September through the end of June 1852. Classes were held in the Union Hotel in Grenada, and also in the College Inn at 123 S. College Street. The college subsequently raised enough money for a building, which was completed by 1858. Emma Mercer Institute A sketch of the Emma Mercer Institute of Grenada, Mississippi, circa 1868. Yalobusha closed during the American Civil War and its buildings were used for hospitals. At the end of the war, Mrs. Emma Holcombe purchased the school building and its property, reopening it in 1866. No later than August 1867, Holcombe renamed the school Emma Mercer Institute. Under Holcombe's lesdership, the Emma Mercer Institute emphasized \\"sound learning, without pretense and show\\" and \\"discipline and order, enforced by firmess, and courtesy.\\" A full renovation was completed in 1870 and the school re-committed itself to Southern women's education. By 1875, financial problems had struck. The local Grange unsuccessfully attempted to buy the institute and turn it into an industrial school. A stock company purchased the property and turned the school into the Grenada Female College. Grenada College In June 1882, Grenada Female College was placed for sale \\"to the highest bidder.\\" It was purchased by the Methodist church, which renamed it Grenada College in 1884. As of 1915, the college granted both Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Letters degrees, and had 13 faculty members. In 1936, financial troubles led the church to close the school and transfer its assets to Millsaps College. The buildings were finally destroyed in the 1980s.

Thomas Charles de Putron (1806–1869) built the oval tower of granite from Herm, completing the work in 1857.BBC – Guernsey history – Brehon Tower, bbc.co.uk; accessed 24 August 2015. Although not strictly a Martello tower, Bréhon represents the final evolution of the basic design of the Martello tower. In 1914 the War Office transferred ownership of Bréhon Tower to the States of Guernsey. During the German occupation of the Channel Islands, the German military placed anti-aircraft guns on the tower. Today, although the site is open to visitors, the tower is closed. The tower holds a light operated by the Guernsey Harbour Authority. The island is home to a breeding colony of common terns. History An obelisk was erected on Bréhon in 1744 to serve as a sea mark. However the lack of visibility of the obelisk led to its replacement in 1824 by a tower 40 ft high and 34 ft in circumference, topped by a globe. During the tenure (1803–1813) of Lieutenant Governor General Sir John Doyle, there were plans to erect a guardhouse on Bréhon, but nothing came of these. Doyle was responsible, however, for substantial fortification efforts elsewhere in Guernsey, including the construction of the Martello towers of Fort Grey, Fort Saumarez, and Fort Hommet. Bréhon Tower with Jethou in background In the 1840s there was a renewed concern about British relations with France, with particular concern for the protection of Alderney and the other Channel Islands because of their strategic importance in the Channel. Lieutenant Governor Major-General Sir William Francis Patrick Napier proposed a number of works, including the establishment of a fort on Bréhon.(1868), Vol. 2, p.127 In 1850 the British became concerned that the French had created fortifications at Cherbourg. This led to the construction of several towers and forts in the Channel area. The Alderney cutter Experiment was wrecked off Bréhon in March 1850; eight people drowned but Guernsey pilot boat Mary of Guernsey saved 20. =Tower= A review of Guerney's defences in 1852 recommended the construction of three artillery barracks, Fort Richmond, Fort Hommet, and Fort Le Marchant, the upgrading of Fort Doyle, and the construction of Bréhon Tower. Work on Bréhon Tower commenced in 1854 and was completed in 1856. The builder was Thomas Charles de Putron, who carried on business at the Pierre Percée.Priaulx Library: The Star, 31 August 1915. -accessed 27 October 2014. The total cost was £8,098 18s 10d.Grimsley (1988), p.53. Bréhon Tower's role was to guard the shipping channel between Guernsey and Herm, and help protect the harbour of St Peter Port. The fort's footprint measures 65 feet by 85 feet (at the widest point), and the tower stands 34 feet high. The tower has three levels. The magazine, shell room, shifting room, stores, and fresh-water cistern were all on the ground floor. It also had latrines on the same floor, a Victorian innovation. The first floor contained the garrison's living quarters. There is also a jetty on the St Peter Port side of the island. The original plan was to put three heavy guns on the gun platform at the top, with five guns on the (second) floor below, sharing the 14 cannon ports. However, during construction the armament was cut back to three 68-pounder and two 10-inch shell guns, all on the gun platform.Lowry (2008), pp.53–54.Clements (1998), p. 135. The guns had a range of 3,000m. In 1859, when loading the guns, each of which weighed 5 tons, a barge capsized and sank; the gun was lost. When the garrison fired the cannons for the first time the concussion created a fracture that extended from top to bottom. The tower's garrison was drawn from the Royal Artillery. The garrison was originally to have consisted of two officers and 60 NCOs and other ranks, but with the reduction in armament, two officers and 30 men was deemed sufficient. Boats from Guernsey brought provisions and fresh drinking water; the cistern provided the water for general use. =20th century= By World War I the tower was obsolete and the War Office turned it over to the States of Guernsey. During World War II, the Germans installed a coast defence gun in a new embrasure cut in the north wall. They also placed two anti-aircraft guns on the roof of the tower. These were credited with shooting down several Allied planes, including 24 year old Flight Lieutenant Hugh Percy (610 Squadron) in a MkXIV Spitfire RB162 on 22 May 1944, and one German plane, which crashed on Crevichon. However, the German plane that crashed on Crevichon on 19 November 1940, killing all its crew, was a Heinkel He 111 that either a British night fighter shot down while the He 111 was flying from France to bomb the south coast of England, or that developed engine trouble on the way.Forty (2005), p.244.

It may be fully defined as a parallel voting system which excludes a portion (up to 100%) of the SMD winners' votes in electing the proportional tier, to result in a more proportional outcome. The exclusion of a portion of the SMD winners' votes is what makes scorporo fundamentally different from parallel voting and somewhat closer to mixed member proportional representation, and thereby between the two in terms of proportionality. The system is only known to have been used in Italy and for a portion of the compensatory tier of the National Assembly of Hungary. Use in Italy Scorporo was in force for elections to the bicameral Parliament of Italy based on Law 277/1993 from 1993 to 2005. Under this system, members could be elected in two ways: *Approximately 75% of elected members were elected in single member districts (SMDs) using first-past-the-post voting. *Approximately 25% of elected members were elected on list basis based on the proportion of the votes received by the party (using the D'Hondt method), with the exclusion of a proportion of any first-placed winner's votes. The system was subject to the following specific rules for each chamber: =Senate= *List seats were calculated at the regional level. *All votes for winning candidates were excluded from the list allocation. *No threshold was applied for list seats. *The SMD vote and the list vote were linked, limiting the use of decoy lists (see below). =Chamber of Deputies= *The list seats were calculated at the national level. *The number of SMD winner's votes excluded from the list vote was equal to the second place candidate's vote total +1. This represented the number of votes needed to elect the winner in the SMD. *A 4% threshold was established for parties to qualify for the list seats. *The local vote and list vote were not tied to each other, thereby providing an incentive for decoy lists (see below). =Abuse in the 2001 Italian Chamber of Deputies election= In the 2001 Italian general election, one of the two main coalitions (the House of Freedoms, which opposed the Scorporo system), linked many of their constituency candidates to a decoy list (liste civetta) for the proportional component, under the name Abolizione Scorporo (Abolish Scorporo). This list was not designed to win proportional seats, but only to soak up constituency votes for House of Freedoms, enabling them to win a larger share of the proportional list seats than they would be entitled to if all candidates were linked other House of Freedoms parties. This intentionally undermined the compensatory nature of the electoral system. As a defensive move, the other coalition, The Olive Tree, created their own decoy list under the name Paese Nuovo (New Country). The decoy lists were extremely successful. Between them, candidates linked to the decoy lists won 360 of the 475 constituency seats, more than half of the total of 630 seats in the Chamber of Deputies. Meanwhile, the decoy lists won a combined total of less than 0.2% of the proportional part of the vote. For the two main coalitions, their vote totals in the proportional component were essentially unaffected by the constituency votes, enabling them to win far more proportional seats than the system was designed for. In the case of Forza Italia (a party within House of Freedoms), the tactic was so successful that it did not have enough candidates in the proportional component, and its list exhausted before it could be awarded all the seats it had won, ultimately missing out on 12 additional seats. This was facilitated by the fact that this particular scorporo system allowed the single-member constituency vote and the proportional list vote not to be linked. Decoy lists are a common issue in all compensatory and pseudo- compensatory systems, and this was not a unique problem for scorporo. =Abolition= Due to Silvio Berlusconi's opposition to the system, Italy reverted to list semi-proportional representation in 2005. In 2018, parallel voting was brought back. Use in Hungary The compensatory tier of the National Assembly of Hungary (which follows a type of parallel voting with an additional compensatory systems) is allocated to parties crossing a national 5% threshold based on losing candidates' votes in the first round of single district voting. However, each party's totals are further augmented by \\"any wasted\\" votes from the regional list-tier elections (see below). Proportional systems Several systems using regional list proportional representation contain a compensatory element similar to scorporo for wasted votes at the district or regional level. Because list PR systems may have more than one candidate elected in a district, typically these systems use \\"wasted votes\\" rather than the votes of losing candidates. Countries that make use of such tiers are: *Hungary (see above) *Austria, which does not use a fixed number of compensatory seats but does allocate votes pertaining to unawarded to fractional seats to its regional and then to a national tier. *Germany proposed a similar compensatory to augment its proposed regionalized MMP as part of its 2009 electoral reform. However, the entire electoral reform law was ruled unconstitutional for other reasons.

Also included are the honorifics reserved for Islamic notables as well as traditional leaders and officials within the Somali customary law (xeer), in addition to the nobiliary particles set aside for distinguished individuals. Monarchs and aristocrats Below is a list of the royal court titles historically retained by the Somali monarchies and aristocracies. =Male titles=  Kings or Rulers  *Suldaan: From the Arabic for Sultan or English \\"Chief\\". Very common title for rulers in the pre-colonial and colonial periods; used throughout the Somali territories, particularly by the Isaaq. Famous Sultans include Fakr ad-Din, the first Sultan of the Sultanate of Mogadishu, who built the 13th-century Fakr ad-Din Mosque; Nur Ahmed Aman, Sultan of the Habr Yunis and one of the founders of the Dervish stateCorrespondence respecting the Rising of Mullah Muhammed Abdullah in Somaliland, and consequent military operations, 1899–1901; Sultan Abdillahi Deria of the Eidagale, who was an anti-colonial figure in the mid-20th century; Mohamoud Ali Shire, the 1st Sultan of the Warsangali Sultanate; Mahmud IV, who reigned in the early 19th century as one of the first Sultans of the Majeerteen Sultanate; Yusuf Ali Kenadid, founder of the Sultanate of Hobyo; and Ibrahim Adeer, founder of the Geledi Sultanate. The title was also employed by the leaders of the influential Ajuran Sultanate, the House of Garen. Sultan Abdillahi Deria, the Grand Sultan of the Ishaaq * Ughaz: Authentic Somali term for \\"Sultan\\". Used throughout the northern and western Somali territories; particularly in the Somali region of Ethiopia and the far northwestern area of the Somali penunsila, but also in central Somalia, southern and northeastern Somalia. The Gadabuursi in particular is the only clan with a longstanding tradition of Sultan. The Gadabursi gave their sultan the title of \\"Ughaz\\".http://www.somalitalk.com/2000/dec/ugaas.html *Boqor: Literally denotes King. However, in practice, it is the primus inter pares or \\"King of Kings\\". The title is etymologically derived from one of the Afro- Asiatic Somali language terms for \\"belt\\", in recognition of the official's unifying role within society. According to Kobishchanow (1987), Boqor is also related to the style Paqar, which was employed by rulers in the early Nile Valley state of Meroe. Various Somali honorifics and designations have Boqor as their root. The latter include Boqortooyo, signifying \\"monarchy\\", \\"kingdom\\" or \\"empire\\"; Boqornimo, meaning \\"royalty\\", \\"nobility\\" or \\"dignitaries\\"; and Boqortinnimo, denoting \\"kingship\\". Historically, the title was mainly used by rulers in the northeastern Puntland region of Somalia. The most prominent Boqor in recent times was Osman Mahamuud, who governed the Majeerteen Sultanate (Majeerteenia) during its 19th-century heyday. Also used among the Gadabuursi as the law of the King and the 100 men' (heerka boqorka iyo boqolka nin). *Gerad/Garad: Often employed interchangeably with \\"Suldaan\\" to denote a Sultan. Etymologically signifies \\"wisdom\\", \\"mind\\" or \\"understanding\\". According to Basset (1952), the title corresponds with the honorific Al- Jaraad, which was used during the Middle Ages by Muslim governors in the Islamic parts of Ethiopia. Gerad was historically employed throughout northern Somalia. *Imam: Denotes the Head of State.Mohamed Haji Muktar, Historical Dictionary of Somalia, (Scarecrow Press: 2003), p.35 Style was used especially by rulers in the Sultanate of Adal and the Ajuran Sultanate. Notable Imams include Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi, also known as Ahmed Gurey or Gran (both meaning \\"the Left Handed\\"), who led a military campaign during the Middle Ages known as the Conquest of Abyssinia (Futuh al-Habash). *Emir: Used by leaders in the Adal Sultanate. Also employed by commanders in the Ajuran Sultanate's armed forces and navy. Prominent Emirs include Nur ibn Mujahid, the Emir of Harar who built the great wall (Jugol) around the city. Royal family *Amir: Prince. Honorific set aside for the hereditary son of the King or Sultan. Notable Princes include Ali Yusuf Kenadid, the son and heir of Sultan Yusuf Ali Kenadid of the Sultanate of Hobyo. *The paramount Ughaz of the Gadabuursi tribe in Harar (1888).Ina Boqor: Alternate court style for the Prince. A term used by Ajuran Empire and a powerful Ajuran princess called Faduma Sarjelle Court officials *Wazir: Minister and/or tax and revenue collector. Title used in the northern Majeerteen Sultanate and Sultanate of Hobyo, as well as the southern Ajuran Sultanate. Wazirs were also quite common at the royal court of the medieval Sultanate of Mogadishu. When the Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta visited Mogadishu in 1331, he indicated that the city was ruled by a Somali Sultan originally from the northern Barbara region, who had a retinue of wazirs, legal experts, commanders, royal eunuchs, and other officials at his service. Other notable wazirs include the maternal grandfather of the Somali General Abdullahi Ahmed Irro, who was part of the Sultanate of Hobyo's aristocratic contingent in the southern town of Kismayo. *Boqortiishe: Viceroy. Style reserved for court officials governing territory on behalf of their Kingdom was mostly used by Ajuran Empire that established many colonies and a famous ruler was Abd al-Aziz of Mogadishu who ruled Maldive islands on behalf of Ajuran Empire *Wakiil-Boqor: Alternate court title designating a Viceroy. *Na'ib/Naïb: Deputy or representative of the Sultan. Duties included the administration of tribute, which was collected by court soldiers. Style was used in the Ajuran Sultanate, Majeerteen Sultanate and Sultanate of Hobyo. *Qadi: Denotes a Chief Judge. Especially common title in northern Somalia, but also used in the southern Ajuran Sultanate. Prominent Qadis include Abd al Aziz al-Amawi, an influential 19th- century diplomat, historian, poet, jurist and scholar who was appointed Qadi of the Kilwa Sultanate at the age of 18 by Muscat and Oman's Sultan Said bin Sultan; and the father of Sheikh Abdurahman Sheikh Nuur, inventor of the Borama script for the Somali language. =Female titles= Consorts *Boqorad: Literally translates as \\"Queen\\". Title mainly reserved for the queen consort of the King (Boqor). Royal family *Amirad: Princess. Honorific set aside for the hereditary daughter of the King or Sultan. *Ina Boqor: Alternate court style for the Prince or Princess. Religious leaders Suldaan Ali Yusuf Kenadid of the Sultanate of Hobyo.Sheikh Ali Ayanle Samatar, a prominent Islamic leader. Islamic leaders within Somali society were often drawn from or elevated to the noble ranks. Below is a list of the titles most often used historically by the clergymen (ulama): *Sheikh: Honorific for senior Muslim clerics (wadaad). Often abbreviated to \\"Sh\\". Famous Sheikhs include Abdirahman bin Isma'il al-Jabarti, an early Muslim leader in northern Somalia; Abadir Umar Ar-Rida, the patron saint of Harar; Abd al-Rahman al- Jabarti, Sheikh of the riwaq in Cairo who recorded the Napoleonic invasion of Egypt; Abd Al-Rahman bin Ahmad al-Zayla'i, scholar who played a crucial role in the spread of the Qadiriyya movement in Somalia and East Africa; Shaykh Sufi, 19th-century scholar, poet, reformist and astrologist who authored Shadjarat al-Yakim (\\"The Tree of Certitude\\"); Abdallah al-Qutbi, polemicist, theologian and philosopher best known for his five-part Al-Majmu'at al- mubaraka (\\"The Blessed Collection\\"); and Muhammad Al-Sumaalee, teacher in the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca who influenced many of the prominent Islamic scholars of today. *Sayyid: Title of high honour meaning \\"Lord\\" or \\"Master\\". Denotes males accepted as descendants of the Islamic prophet Muhammad through his grandsons, Hasan ibn Ali and Hussein ibn Ali, sons of the prophet's daughter Fatima Zahra and his son-in-law Ali ibn Abi Talib.Ho, Engseng, Graves of Tarim, (University of California Press: 2006), Berkeley. p.149 Used by leaders in the Dervish State; notably by Mohammed Abdullah Hassan (\\"Mad Mullah\\"). *Sharif (pl. Ashraaf): Historically used to distinguish descendants of Hassan 'Ali Abuu Taalib (Hasan ibn Ali). Often reserved for early Islamic leaders such as Sharif Yusuf Barkhadle (popularly known as Aw Barkhadle or the \\"Blessed Father\\"), a man described as \\"the most outstanding saint in northern Somalia\\". *Haji: Honorific reserved for distinguished individuals who have performed the hajj, or pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca. Traditional leaders and officials Below is a list of the titles traditionally employed by leaders and officials within the Somali customary law or xeer. =Leaders= *Islan: Clan chief. Title evolved after the fragmentation in the 18th century of the great Harti confederation that dominated the northeastern Horn region since at least the 14th century. A general process of decentralization ensued, with new leaders known as Islaan assuming at the local level some of the power that was previously solely commanded by the Sultan of Majeerteenia, the titular head of the entire confederation. Although they nominally asserted independence from the sultanate, Islaan's mainly wielded religious rather than political authority. *Malakh: Signifies \\"War Leader\\". Historically used mainly by the Rahanweyn clan that today forms one of the largest constituencies in southern Somalia, in addition to a few sympatric clans. Usually assigned to the Herabow sub-lineage, from which two male constituents were selected to manage the group's military affairs. *Akil: From the Arabic for \\"wise man\\". A common title for male elders, who are the traditional clan chiefs. Used in the north, particularly in the Somaliland region of Somalia.Abdullahi, p.140 =Officials= *Oday (pl. Odayal): Literally \\"elder\\". The most common title for advisors to the clan head or judges in xeer hearings. Used throughout the Somali territories. *Heer begti or Heer boggeyal: Jurists or legal experts in xeer. *Gurtiyal: Detectives. *Garhajiyal: Attorneys in xeer cases. *Murkhatiyal: Witnesses in official xeer proceedings. *Waranle: Police officers to enforce the customary law. Nobiliary particles *Aw: Nobiliary particle meaning \\"honorable\\", \\"venerable\\", or simply \\"Sir\\". Reserved for learned Islamic clerics, and used throughout the Somali territories. During his research in the ancient town of Amud, the historian G.W.B. Huntingford noticed that whenever an old site had the prefix Aw in its name (such as the ruins of Awbare and Awbube), it denoted the final resting place of a local saint.G.W.B. Huntingford, \\"The Town of Amud, Somalia\\", Azania, 13 (1978), p. 184 Similarly, the ancient island of Aw Garweyne on the southeastern Benadir littoral was named for the late Sheikh 'Ismaan, whose tomb is found there. Surveys by A.T. Curle in 1934 on several of these important ruined cities recovered various artefacts, such as pottery and coins, which point to a medieval period of activity at the tail end of the Sultanate of Adal's reign. Northern Somalia in general is home to numerous such archaeological sites, with similar edifices found at Haylan, Qa’ableh, Macajilayn, Booco, Qombo'ul, El Ayo, Heis, Botiala, Salweyn, Mudun, Abasa, Maduna and Damo, among other areas.Michael Hodd, East African Handbook, (Trade & Travel Publications: 1994), p.640.

Its most famous cover was its first, a 1967 cover by Keith & Tex. That rendition was in turn sampled by various artists, including Scotty, the Beastie Boys and Vanilla Ice. The song has also been covered by Clint Eastwood & General Saint and Don Campbell. Lyrics The original version of \\"Stop That Train\\" is sung from the point of view of a woman whose boyfriend is leaving by train for a long absence. She yells at the conductor, apparently in vain, to \\"stop that train\\", because she wants to join him on board. Keith & Tex version Jamaican duo Keith & Tex covered the song in 1967, in their signature rocksteady style. Their version flipped the song's genders, changing the lyrics from \\"my baby he is leaving\\" to \\"my baby she is leaving\\". The song became Keith & Tex's biggest hit. =Samples= Several dub versions of the song were recorded, which sampled the Keith & Tex version. The most notable was \\"Draw Your Brakes\\" by Scotty, which appeared on the classic soundtrack album to the 1972 film The Harder They Come. Another dub version was the 1972 \\"Cool Breeze\\" by Big Youth.Stop That Train: Updated, Dub Nerd, July 30, 2008 The Keith & Tex version was also sampled by the Beastie Boys, on the section called \\"Stop That Train\\" from their 1989 song B-Boy Bouillabaisse. It was also sampled by rapper Vanilla Ice, in a 1991 single also entitled \\"Stop That Train\\". Other covers The Jamaican reggae duo Clint Eastwood & General Saint recorded a cover version of \\"Stop That Train\\", which was released as a single in 1983, and was the title track of their 1983 album Stop That Train. Their version replaced the original song's verses with an interpolation of the folk song 500 Miles, as well as the lyrics \\"Hey mister postman, bring back my woman\\". British reggae singer Don Campbell, along with General Saint, recorded a cover version of Stop That Train in 1994, as \\"Saint & Campbell\\". Their version had a house music influence, and replaced the original song's verses with new lyrics sung in a toasting style.

Musikay was founded in 2005 under the name Oakville Chamber Choir (renamed 'Oakville Chamber Ensemble' in 2007 and then 'Oakville Ensemble' in 2010) by Artistic Director Stephane Potvin, a Quebec born conductor who also served as Resident Conductor and Artistic Administrator to the Thunder Bay Symphony Orchestra. In 2006, Musikay grew to eight voices and presented its first concert as part of the Boris Brott Summer Music Festival . In the Spring of 2007, the group offered its first self-presented performance. In the Fall of that same year, the group was renamed the Oakville Chamber Ensemble and began to offer a full series of 5 concerts per season. A few seasons later, to avoid confusion with other local groups similarly named, the Oakville Chamber Ensemble was renamed Musikay.

Recognised as a founding member of the UK Working Group on Landmines (established as the UK arm of the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize-winning International Campaign to Ban Landmines), JLC actively contributed to the UK campaign and helped strengthen the international campaign against landmines. In 2005, JLC changed its name to Disability and Development Partners. The charity's name was originally inspired by the Indian-made Jaipur foot as JLC was campaigning for suitable rehabilitation services for the many thousands of amputees and victims of the widespread use of landmines in civil wars. The name change was motivated by the evolution of the mission of the charity over the years, broadening their field of work to all kinds of disabilities. Work and achievements DDP does not perform development work itself; rather it collects donations in the UK to fund partner projects throughout the developing world. Over its 20-year history, DDP has helped fund projects through sixteen partnerships in eight different countries. DDP established four rehabilitation centres providing prosthetic, orthotic and rehabilitation therapy services in Mozambique, Bangladesh, Ethiopia and India. In India, the charity has been supporting Mobility India to become a leading NGO helping to develop their technical, training and community based programmes and supporting the building of their modern and fully accessible headquarters to include a rehabilitation workshop, production facilities including a Jaipur foot production unit run by disabled women, a training centre and student dormitories. DDP has supported over fifty people, (of whom half are women and many are disabled) from partner organization in six countries who have received formal training and professional skills in orthotics, prosthetics and rehabilitation therapy. They return to improve and enhance rehabilitation services provided to disabled people by their own organizations and workshops. The development and dissemination of prefabricated calliper components and ankle joints for rapid delivery of rehabilitation services was undertaken by DDP with Mobility India, who have subsequently disseminated these prefabricated components widely in India and in other countries where polio has been a problem. DDP set up Nepal’s first Drop-in Centre for mental ill health sufferers and their families and offering a safe haven for women who were forced into destitution because of mental illness. The charity continued to support disabled people's human rights and inclusion campaigns in Mozambique, Angola, Nepal, India and Ethiopia. In Nepal, DDP's partner DHRC took their campaign to Supreme Court level in Nepal to ensure that disabled children and young people's right to a free education was protected. The NGO is a member of the core group that wrote the World Health Organization’s new improved Community Based Rehabilitation guidelines published in 2011. DDP has also been supporting the development and building capacity of Aurora Deaf Aid Africa, a UK-based Diaspora group of deaf people. Livelihood programmes were established targeting thousands of disabled adults and parents and family members of disabled children to reduce poverty among disabled people and their families in India, Mozambique, Angola, Cape Verde and Ethiopia. Inclusive education programmes in India and Ethiopia enabled hundreds of disabled and other marginalized children to have a chance in education and to change their lives for the better. DDP has conducted research that has led to project work. In Mozambique they researched and reported on HIV and AIDS and the extent of disabled people's knowledge about the two and of their inclusion in prevention programmes and services as well as in national policies to do with HIV and AIDS. They used the research findings to develop programmes to get more disabled people included in mainstream HIV and AIDS projects, get services, create awareness and ensure their inclusion in national HIV and AIDS policy. In 2011 DDP produced a report on deaf children in Burundi, in particular their education and communication needs which led to funds being raised to support one of the only two deaf schools in Burundi and to support pupils who wanted to progress to hearing secondary school. There are no secondary schools for the deaf in the country. Publications ; HIV & AIDS and Disability in Mozambique (April 2008) The report underlines the exclusion of disabled people from HIV & AIDS policies and service programmes and to identify the causes and implications of this neglect. The omission of disabled people from supra- national development instruments mirrors more general discrimination and reflects disabled people's voicelessness and invisibility in Mozambique. The report explains the need for disabled people to be included in the country's HIV/AIDS policy and decisions, treatment and prevention programmes and to increase disabled people's awareness of HIV & AIDS. ; Deaf children in Burundi – their education and communications needs (October 2011) The participative research brings together associations, schools, government representatives and above all, deaf children themselves and their parents to understand the problems they face and their aspirations for the future and then to try to identify practical strategies to meet both. The study analyses the status and standard of sign language as currently used in Burundi.

Kasha (火車) from alt= The kasha (火車, lit. \\"burning chariot\\" or \\"burning barouche\\" or 化車, \\"changed wheel\\") is a Japanese yōkai that steals the corpses of those who have died as a result of accumulating evil deeds. Summary Kasha are a yōkai that would steal corpses from funerals and cemeteries, and what exactly they are is not firmly set, and there are examples all throughout the country. In many cases their true identity is actually a cat yōkai, and it is also said that cats that grow old would turn into this yōkai, and that their true identity is actually a nekomata. However, there are other cases where the kasha is depicted as an oni carrying the damned in a cart to hell. There are tales of kasha in tales like the folktale Neko Danka etc., and there are similar tales in the Harima Province (now Hyōgo Prefecture), in Yamasaki (now Shisō), there is the tale of the \\"Kasha-baba\\". As a method of protecting corpses from kasha, in Kamikuishiki, Nishiyatsushiro District, Yamanashi Prefecture (now Fujikawaguchiko, Kōfu), at a temple that a kasha is said to live near, a funeral is performed twice, and it is said that by putting a rock inside the coffin for the first funeral, this protects the corpse from being stolen by the kasha. Also, in Yawatahama, Ehime, Ehime prefecture, it is said that leaving a hair razor on top of the coffin would prevent the kasha from stealing the corpse. In Saigō, Higashiusuki District, Miyzaki Prefecture (now Misato), it is said that before a funeral procession, \\"I will not let baku feed on this (バクには食わせん)\\" or \\"I will not let kasha feed on this (火車には食わせん)\\" is chanted twice. In the village of Kumagaya, Atetsu District, Okayama Prefecture (now Niimi), it is said that a kasha is avoided by playing a myobachi (妙八) (a traditional Japanese musical instrument). Japanese folklore often describes the Kasha as humanoid cat-demons with the head of a cat or tiger and a burning tail. They are similar to other demons such as Nekomata and Bakeneko and get often interchanged with them. Kashas are said to travel the world on burning chariots or barouches, stealing the corpses of recently deceased humans, which were not yet buried and who had been sinful in life. They bring their souls to hell.Michaela Haustein: Mythologien der Welt. Japan, Ainu, Korea. ePubli, Berlin 2011, , page 25.Bokushi Suzuki: Snow country tales. Life in the other Japan.

It is said that this kasha appeared together with harsh lightning and rain, and in the book's illustration, like the raijin, it wears a fundoshi made with a tiger's skin, and is depicted possessing a drum that can cause lightning (refer to image). ;\\"Holy Priest Onyo Himself Rides with a Kasha\\" from the \\"Shin Chomonjū (新著聞集),\\" Chapter Five \\"Acts of Prayer\\" :In Bunmei 11, July 2, at the Zōjō-ji, Holy Priest Onyo was greeted by a kasha. This kasha was not an envoy of hell, but rather an envoy of the pure land, and thus here, the appearance of a kasha depended on whether or not one believed in the afterlife. ;\\"Looking at a Kasha, Getting Sore at the Waist and Legs, and Collapsing\\" from the \\"Shin Chomonjū\\", Chapter Ten \\"Strange Events\\" :It was at the village of Myōganji near Kisai in Bushū. One time, a man named Yasubei who ran an alcohol shop suddenly ran off down a path, shouted \\"a kasha is coming,\\" and collapsed. By the time the family rushed to him, he had already lost his sanity and was unable to listen to anything said to him, fell asleep, and it is said that ten days later, his lower body started rotting and he died. ;\\"Cutting the Hand of an Ogre in a Cloud at the Place of Funeral\\" from the \\"Shin Chomonjū\\", Chapter Ten \\"Strange Events\\" :When a warrior named Matsudaira Gozaemon participated in the funeral procession of his male cousin, thunder began to rumble, and from a dark cloud that covered the sky, a kasha stuck out an arm of one like a bear, and attempted to steal the corpse. When it was cut off by a sword, it was said that the arm had three dreadful nails, and was covered by hair that looked like silver needles. ;\\"A Kasha Seizes and Takes Away an Avaricious Old Woman\\" from the \\"Shin Chomonjū\\", Chapter Fourteen \\"Calamities\\" :When a feudal lord of Hizen, the governor of Inaba, Oomura, and several others, were going around the seacoast of Bizen, a black cloud appeared from afar, and echoed a shriek, \\"ah, how sad (あら悲しや),\\" and a person's feet stuck out from the cloud. When the governor of Inaba's retinue dragged it down, it turned out to be the corpse of an old woman. When the people in the surroundings were asked about the circumstances, it turned out that the old woman was terribly stingy, and was detested by those around her, but one time when she went outside to go to the bathroom, a black cloud suddenly swooped down and took her away. To the people of that society, it was the deed of a devil called \\"kasha.\\" ;\\"Kasha\\" from the \\"Bōsō Manroku\\" (茅窓漫録) :It would sometimes happen that in the middle of a funeral procession, rain and wind would suddenly come forth, blow away the coffin, and cause the corpse to be lost, but this was due to how a kasha from hell came to greet it, and caused people to be afraid and feel ashamed. It is said that the kasha would tear up the corpse, hang it on rocks or trees in the mountains. In the book, there are many kasha in Japan and in China, and here it was the deed of a beast called Mōryō (魍魎), and in the illustration, it was written as 魍魎 and given the reading \\"kuhashiya\\" (refer to image). ;\\"Priest Kitataka\\" from the Hokuetsu Seppu :It was in the Tenshō period. At a funeral in the Uonuma District, Echigo Province, a sudden gust and a ball of fire came flying to it, and covered the coffin. Inside the ball of fire, was a giant cat with two tails, and it attempted to steal the coffin. This yōkai was repelled by the priest of Dontōan, Kitataka, by his incantation and a single strike of his nyoi, and the kesa of Kitagawa was afterwards called the \\"kasha-otoshi no kesa\\" (the kesa of the one who defeated a kasha). Similar things Things of the same kind as kasha, or things thought of as a different name for kasha, are as follows. In Tōno, Iwate Prefecture, called \\"kyasha\\", at the mountain next to the pass that continued from the village of Ayaori, Kamihei District (now part of Tōno) to the village of Miyamori (now also part of Tōno), there lived a thing that took on the appearance of a woman who wore a kinchaku bag tied to her front, and it is said that it would steal corpses from coffins at funerals and dig up corpses from the gravesites and eat the corpses. In the village of Minamimimaki, Nagano Prefecture (now Saku), it is also called \\"kyasha,\\" and like usual, it would steal corpses from funerals. In the Yamagata Prefecture, a story is passed down where when a certain wealthy man died, a kasha-neko (カシャ猫 or 火車猫) appeared before him and attempted to steal his corpse, but the priest of Seigen-ji drove it away. What was then determined to have been its remaining tail was then presented to the temple of Hase-kannon as a charm against evil spirits, which is open to the public on new years each year. In the village of Akihata, Kanra District, Gunma Prefecture (now Kanra), a monster that would eat human corpses are called \\"tenmaru\\", and in order to defend against this, the bamboo basket on top was protected. In Himakajima, Aichi Prefecture, kasha are called madōkusha, and it is said that a cat that would reach one hundred years of age would become a yōkai. In the Izumi region, Kagoshima Prefecture, called \\"kimotori\\", they are said to appear at the gravesite after funerals. Development of the term and concept over time Kasha literally means \\"burning cart\\" or \\"fiery chariot\\". During Japan's Middle Ages and early modern era, Kasha were depicted as a fiery chariot who took the dead away to hell, and were depicted as such in Buddhist writings, such as rokudo-e. Kasha also appeared in Buddhist paintings of the era, notably jigoku-zōshi (Buddhist ‘hellscapes’, paintings depicting the horrors of hell), where they were depicted as flaming carts pulled by demons or oni. The tale of the kasha was used by the Buddhist leadership to persuade the populace to avoid sin. It was said that during the funeral procession of a sinful man, the kasha would come for the body. When kasha arrived, they were accompanied by black clouds and a fearsome wind. These great winds would be strong enough to lift the coffin into the sky, out of the hands of those bearing it on their shoulders. When this occurred, the pallbearers would explain it as the body having been “possessed by the kasha” The legends state that if a monk is present in the funeral procession, then the body could be reclaimed by the monk throwing a rosary at the coffin, saying a prayer, or signing their seal onto the coffin. The remedy for a kasha corpse abduction varies by region and source. However, if no monk was present or no rosary thrown, then the coffin and body lying therein were taken away to hell. Alternatively, the body would be disrespected by the kasha by being savagely torn into pieces and hung on adjacent tree limbs or rocks. Over time, the image of the kasha evolved from a chariot of fire to a corpse-stealing cat demon that appeared at funerals. It is not clear how or when the flaming cart demon and bakeneko were confounded, but in many cases, kasha are depicted as cat demons, often wreathed in flame. This has led to the modern-day conception of the kasha as one variety of bakeneko, or 'monster cats'. There is some considerable discussion on the origin of the feline appearance of the modern kasha. Some believe that the kasha was given a feline appearance when the previous conception of the kasha was given the attributes of another corpse- robbing yokai, the Chinese Mōryō or wangliang. In the aforementioned \\"Bōsō Manroku\\", the characters 魍魎 were read \\"kuhashiya\\", in the essay Mimibukuro by Negishi Shizumori, in volume four \\"Kiboku no Koto\\" (鬼僕の事), there is a scene under the name, \\"The One Called Mōryō\\" (魍魎といへる者なり). In Japan, from old times, cats were seen as possessing supernatural abilities, and there are legends such as \\"one must not let a cat get near a corpse\\" and \\"when a cat leaps over a coffin, the corpse inside the coffin will wake up.\\" Also, in the collection of setsuwa tales, the Uji Shūi Monogatari from medieval Japan, a gokusotsu (an evil ogre that torments the dead in hell) would drag a burning hi no kuruma (wheel of fire), it is said that they would attempt to take away the corpses of sinners, or living sinners. It has thus been determined that the legend of the kasha was born as a result of the mixture of legends concerning cats and the dead, and the legend of the \\"hi no kuruma\\" that would steal away sinners. Another popular viewpoint is that kasha were given the cat-like appearance after it was noted that in rare cases, cats will consume their deceased owners. This is a rather unusual occurrence, but there are recorded modern cases of this. Another theory states that the legend of kappa making humans drown and eating their innards from their butts was born as a result of the influence of this kasha. Re-usage of the term The Japanese Idiom \\"hi no kuruma\\", an alternate reading of 火車, \\"kasha\\", meaning \\"to be in a difficult financial situation\\" or \\"to be strapped for cash\\", comes from how the dead would receive torture from the kasha on their journey to hell. In the region of the Harima Province, old women with bad personalities are said to be called \\"kasha-baba\\" (\\"kasha old women\\"), with the nuance that they are old women that are like bakeneko. How the yarite, the woman who controls the yūjo in the yūkaku, is called \\"kasha\\" (花車, \\"flower wheel\\") comes from this kasha, and as the yarite was the woman who managed everything, and how the word \\"yarite\\" is also used to indicate people who move bullock carts (gissha or gyūsha) also comes from this.

The ancestors of all kangaroos are thought to be small marsupials that look like present-day opossums. Tree-kangaroos have developed long tails for balancing in the trees, and strong forelimbs for climbing. Their teeth are developed for tearing leaves rather than cutting grass. The Buergers' tree- kangaroo, along with nine other species of tree-kangaroo, are endangered and on the brink of extinction. The key threats to their survival include dwindling habitat due to logging; mining; road kill by humans and predation by domestic and wild dogs.

Only a black-and-white print of this episode seems to have survived, and it has been released on DVD. The commercials seen live during the program have also survived. The program is introduced on kinescope by host William Lundigan. The production boasted a script and lyrics by noted American playwright Maxwell Anderson, and a score by Bernard Herrmann. Fredric March, in his only known portrayal of the role, starred as Ebenezer Scrooge, and Basil Rathbone portrayed Marley's Ghost.Oliver, Wayne. \\"Rathbone Says Dickens Would Be Top Writer for TV\\" (Sarasota Journal, December 1, 1954, page 14) The production featured few songs, but those it did feature forced the adapters to severely condense the story, especially the final third. Rather than having a Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, the adaptation featured a mynah bird, who leads Scrooge to a graveyard in which he sees not only his own grave, but that of Tiny Tim. The script added an unusual twist to the story in having the Ghost of Christmas Past (Sally Fraser) and the Ghost of Christmas Present (Ray Middleton) be portrayed by the same actors who played Scrooge's sweetheart Belle and his nephew Fred, respectively, and Scrooge not only notices the resemblance, but mistakes the Ghost of Christmas Present for his nephew.Gaver, Jack. \\"Who But TV People Would Do Such A Thing?\\" (Beaver Valley Times, December 24, 1954, page 20) Cast *Fredric March as Scrooge *Basil Rathbone as Marley's Ghost *Ray Middleton as Fred and the Ghost of Christmas Present *Bob Sweeney as Bob Cratchit *Christopher Cook as Tiny Tim *Sally Fraser as Belle and the Ghost of Christmas Past *Craig Hill as Young Scrooge *Queenie Leonard as Mrs. Cratchit *Rex Evans as Solicitor *Tony Pennington as His Companion *William Griffiths as The Book Buyer *Peter Miles as Peter Cratchit *Janine Perreau as Belinda Cratchit *Bonnie and Judy Franklin as Susan and Martha Cratchit *June Ellis as The Housekeeper *Dick Elliott as Fezzwig (uncredited) See also * Adaptations of A Christmas Carol References External links *IMDB external reviews for the production 1954 American television episodes Musicals based on A Christmas Carol Television shows based on A Christmas Carol 1954 musicals ","title":"A Christmas Carol (Shower of Stars)"},{"id":"36534163","text":"The 1996 season is the 43rd year in Guangzhou Football Club's existence, their 29th season in the Chinese football league and the 3rd season in the professional football league.

He is considered one of the most outstanding film composers of the German- speaking countries, winning the German Film Award five times. His debut was in 1986 the score for the film Du mich auch, directed by Dani Levy, for whom he has composed all further scores. He had his breakthrough with the music for the film Beyond Silence, directed by Caroline Link in 1996.  Biography  Niki Reiser was born in 1958 in Reinach, Aargau in Switzerland, the son of a pastor and a nurse. Before he came to Basel age twelve, where he has lived since, he spent four years in Schaffhausen. In addition to classical flute lessons a child, he invented his own melodies on the piano. In his youth he played in several bands, composed pieces for them and for theater performances at school. In the 1970s, Reiser studied classical music with an emphasis on flute in Basel. From 1980 to 1984 he studied in Boston at the Berklee College of Music jazz and classical music with a focus on film music. From 1984 to 1986, Reiser lived partly in Europe, mostly in Switzerland, where he continued his studies in composition in Basel. In workshops in the U.S., he met Ennio Morricone and Jerry Goldsmith who influenced his music. During this time he composed his first pieces for movies. During this period he also toured as a jazz flutist with the ensemble People, which he had co-founded. In 1986, Reiser moved back to Europe where he met the film director Dani Levy. He composed the music for his first film Du mich auch. The film was a surprising success throughout Europe and was nominated for the Golden Camera at the Cannes International Film Festival in 1987. This encounter started a lasting friendship, resulting in Reiser composing the music for all of Levy's films. At that time Reiser joined the klezmer band Kolsimcha as a flutist, and composed several pieces for the group. On two world tours he played with the band in Carnegie Hall and at the Montreux Jazz Festival, among others. When Reiser realised that it was impossible to be a flutist and a composer at the same time, he concentrated on composition. In addition to working with Levy, he also composed for Caroline Link, whom he met in 1996. His breakthrough came with the music for her movie Beyond Silence. For her film Nowhere in Africa, Reiser studied African music in Nairobi. The influences of indigenous Kenyan music can be seen in the score he composed for the film. In addition to cinema and TV films, he also wrote music for the theater. In 2008 he worked again for Link for A Year Ago in Winter. The score won both the Preis der deutschen Filmkritik and the Deutscher Filmpreis of 2009. Reiser has his studio in Basel's Gundeldingerfeld. He is on the board of the Deutsche Filmakademie since its inception in 2003.  Awards  As of 2012, Reiser was awarded the German film prize Deutscher Filmpreis five times. In 2005, he was the 12th recipient of the Rheingau Music Prize, as \\"a composer who repeatedly and majestically succeeds in meeting the particular dramaturgical needs entailed by film scores, and thus suffusing each individual work with its own unique sound\\". * 1997 Bayerischer Filmpreis for Beyond Silence * 1997 Deutscher Filmpreis for Beyond Silence * 1999 Deutscher Filmpreis for Meschugge and Annaluise & Anton * 2001 Film music prize of the SUISA foundation for Kalt ist der Abendhauch * 2002 Deutscher Filmpreis for Nowhere in Africa * 2004 Preis der deutschen Filmkritik for Das fliegende Klassenzimmer * 2005 Deutscher Filmpreis for Alles auf Zucker! * 2005 Rheingau Music Prize * 2008 Bayerischer Filmpreis for Liebesleben * 2009 Preis der deutschen Filmkritik for A Year Ago in Winter * 2009 Deutscher Filmpreis for A Year Ago in Winter * 2011 Film music prize of the SUISA foundation Das Blaue vom Himmel  Filmography  * 1986: Du mich auch – directed by Anja Franke, Dani Levy * 1986: Die Nacht der lebenden Schäffchen (short film) – directed by Walder, Zago * 1989: RobbyKallePaul – directed by Dani Levy * 1989: Abgeschleppt – directed by Dani Levy * 1992: I was on Mars – directed by Dani Levy * 1993: Anna annA – directed by Jürgen Brauer, Greti Kläy * 1994: Keiner liebt mich – directed by Doris Dörrie * 1994: Wilder Hunger (short film) – directed by Hercli Bundi * 1995: Surprise!

It is one of the main lines of the Italian rail system and links the northern cities with the most important productive areas of central and southern Italy. The railway was built by the Società per le Strade Ferrate Meridionali (Italian: Company for the Southern Railways, SFM), between 1863 and 1872. In 1906, management of the line was taken over by Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane. In 1933, the southernmost Lecce-Otranto segment of the line was turned over to the Ferrovie del Sud Est, which has maintained it to the present day. History Shortly after the proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy, the new government took over the granting of railway concessions, which, in prior years, had often been doled out in a haphazard manner by the different states and provisional dictatorial governments of the Italian Peninsula to various companies: canceling some, changing others and continually releasing new rights-of-way. In November 1861 the Milan–Bologna railway line began operation, with the connection of the Milan-Piacenza line to the Piacenza-Bologna via a bridge – initially of wood but later replaced by an iron structure – across the river Po. This allowed trains from Turin and France to travel directly to the Adriatic coast along the Ancona-Bologna line, which itself had been built in November 1861 by the SFR, in what was then the Papal States. The construction of an Adriatic line had long been desired, but had never come to pass: mainly because of the difficulty in reconciling the needs of the two countries – the Papal States and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies – through whose territories the line would pass. The constitution of the kingdom of Italy in 1860 brought a resolution to this dilemma, and, as entrepreneurs in Piedmont and Lombardy desired access to Adriatic ports for closer and easier trade with Asia through the Suez Canal, construction would proceed rapidly following unification. As early as May 1861, a detailed and complex feasibility study was presented to the Chamber of Deputies for new railways in southern Italy that were considered of vital importance. In particular, the construction of a railway along the Adriatic coast from Ancona to Brindisi and Otranto was seen as essential, as these ports were considered by manyAnnali Universali di Statistica by Giuseppe Sacchi, Vol. CXLV, prima. Milano series, 1 st quarter 1861 to be on the verge of becoming Europe's \\"door to the East.\\" At that time, several European countries were competing for the privilege of transporting the Imperial Indian Mail train (referred to in Italy as the Valigia delle Indie), in hopes of sharing in the profits of the trade between England and its vast colonial empire.Ernesto Petrucci The '48 and the railway question in the Papal States on page 19, History and Future 1/2002 In July 1862, Count Pietro Bastogi, former Finance Minister of the Kingdom of Italy succeeded in putting together a consortium of 92 bankers with the huge sum (at that time) of 100 million gold lire of capital from entirely Italian sources.Gian Guido Turchi, 150 di ferrovia in Italia, in iTreni 97, Editrice ETR, Salò,1989 The Società per le Strade Ferrate Meridionali (Italian: 'Company for the Southern Railways', SFM) moved quickly to build the rail line, completing the Brindisi-Lecce segment by 1866. The Lecce-Otranto segment was delayed by bitter controversies which prevented the choice of a route for many years. The last stretch of 19 miles from Maglie to Otranto was not complete until 20 September 1872. The new Adriatic Railway allowed, for the first time, relatively rapid travel between the south and the north-central regions of Italy. In 1866, in fact, there were no railways on the Tyrrhenian coast south of Eboli. Vittorio Emanuele II on 9 November 1863 inaugurated the line with his train ride from Pescara to Foggia, following hurried work to finish the track. The public opening was postponed until 25 April 1864. In the proceedings of the first legislature of the Kingdom of Italy, the parliamentarian Leopoldo Galeotti wrote hopefully that \\"before long the port of Brindisi, reborn to a new life, will bring within her breast the Indian Mail, a sure sign that the commerce of the world will be drawn a second time to our seas. In a few days, thanks to the great industry of Southern Company, despite the obstacles of every kind that had to be overcome, locomotives will arrive at the port of Brindisi.\\"La Prima Legislatura del regno d'Italia, Leopoldo Galeotti. Florence, Le Monnier, 1865 In September 1871 the completion of the Fréjus Rail Tunnel allowed the luxury Peninsular Express (from the same company that operated the famous Orient Express) to complete the London- Brindisi trip in 47 hours via Calais and Paris.Stefano Maggi, Tra pubblico e privato. La gestione delle ferrovie nell'800 e primo '900, in Tutto Treno & Storia 22, pp. 22, 23. Duegi Editrice, Albignasego, 2002 The line was built in record time using the easiest and least demanding engineering methods (tunnels and viaducts), often near the sea. Weather was a significant cause of work interruptions, due to the heavy storms that frequently batter the Adriatic coast. = 21st century: Double track = The line was reoriented in 2004, with double tracking, for the stretch from Lesina to Apricena (saving about 2.5 km), while at the end of 2005, the railway between Ortona and Vasto Casalbordino and between the Port of Vasto and Vasto / San Salvo were also realigned; for the dual purpose of eliminating the multiple curves in the old section, and reducing the danger posed by storm surges and coastal erosion. Between 2002 and 2006 the track between Brindisi and Lecce was doubled, followed by the segment between Bari Centrale and Fasano. In 2007 the segment between San Severo and Apricena was also given double track. The only stretch of the Adriatic line that remains single track is from Termoli to Lesina, which is the bottleneck of the line. Features A notable aspect of the Adriatic line is the almost total absence of tunnels, with the exception of the Pescara-Vasto segment, where there are seven, including three with a length greater than 5000 m. The railway is almost entirely double track, and is DC electrified to 3000 V.

A few years after creating the character in 1928, Charteris was successful in getting RKO Radio Pictures interested in a film based on one of his books. The first, The Saint in New York, came in 1938 and was based on the 1935 novel of the same name. It starred Louis Hayward as Simon Templar and Jonathan Hale as Inspector Henry Farnack, the American counterpart to the British character, Chief inspector Claud Eustace Teal. The film was a success and seven more films followed rapidly. They were sometimes based upon outlines by Charteris, while others were based loosely on his novels or novellas. George Sanders took over from Hayward as The Saint in the second film, and starred in a further four between 1939 and 1941, before being enticed by RKO to play the lead in their forthcoming series about The Falcon, which they made into a blatant copy of The Saint. In 1941, Hugh Sinclair took over the role as Templar for two more films; The Saint's Vacation and The Saint Meets the Tiger. However, by the time shooting finished of The Saint Meets the Tiger in June 1941, a major dispute ensued between Charteris and RKO over the upcoming first film in The Falcon series, The Gay Falcon, which was due for release in October 1941. Charteris argued that it was a case of copyright infringement, as RKO's version of The Falcon was an obvious copy of his own character, and the fact that their film starred George Sanders, who personified The Saint after having played him in five of the seven films released up to that point, made this even more obvious.p.69 Barer,Burl The Saint: A Complete History in Print, Radio, Film and Television of Leslie Charteris' Robin Hood of Modern Crime, Simon Templar 1928-1992 McFarland, 2003 The legal dispute forced RKO to put the film on hold. The conflict wasn't settled until 1943, with RKO selling the US distribution rights to Republic Pictures, while RKO's British arm handled the UK distribution as originally planned. The film was released in both countries in 1943. * The Saint in New York (1938) – with Louis Hayward as The Saint * The Saint Strikes Back (1939) – with George Sanders as The Saint * The Saint in London (1939) – with George Sanders as The Saint * The Saint's Double Trouble (1940) – with George Sanders as The Saint * The Saint Takes Over (1940) – with George Sanders as The Saint * The Saint in Palm Springs (1941) –with George Sanders as The Saint * The Saint's Vacation (1941) – with Hugh Sinclair as The Saint * The Saint Meets the Tiger (produced in 1941 but not released until 1943) – with Hugh Sinclair as The Saint In the 1930s, RKO also purchased the rights to produce a film adaptation of Saint Overboard, but no such film was ever produced. A ninth film, The Saint's Return (known as The Saint's Girl Friday in the US) from 1953, with Louis Hayward returning as The Saint, is sometimes regarded as part of the RKO series. However, it was produced by British Hammer Film Productions 12 years after the conflict between Charteris and RKO, based on a special agreement between Hammer Films and Leslie Charteris, which gave Charteris a percentage in the film.p. 105 Barer, Burl The Saint: A Complete History in Print, Radio, Film and Television of Leslie Charteris' Robin Hood of Modern Crime, Simon Templar 1928-1992 McFarland, 2003 RKO acted only as the film's US distributor, six months after the UK release.

Some of these beliefs are popular superstitions, while others are actually better described as traditions, stories, folklore, tropes, myths, or legend. The origins of many of these superstitions are based in the inherent risks of sailing, and luck, either good or bad, as well as portents and omens that would be given associative meaning in relation to the life of a mariner, sailor, fisherman or a crew in general. Even into the 21st century, \\"fishers and related fishing workers\\" still have amongst the most dangerous jobs, with the second highest rate of mortality only after loggers. Bad luck By far the best known sailors' superstitions involve bad luck. =Red sunrise= Sailors are taught if the sunrise is red to take warning. The day ahead will be dangerous. \\"Red Sky at night, Sailors delight; Red Sky in the morning, Sailors take warning.\\" This saying actually has some scientific validity, although it assumes storms systems will approach from the west, and is therefore generally correct only at mid-latitudes where, due to the rotation of the Earth, prevailing winds travel west to east. If the morning skies are red, it is because clear skies over the horizon to the east permit the sun to light the undersides of moisture-bearing clouds. Conversely, in order to see red clouds in the evening, sunlight must have a clear path from the west, so therefore the prevailing westerly wind must be bringing clear skies. =Jonah= A \\"Jonah\\" is a long-established expression among sailors, meaning a person (either a sailor or a passenger) who is bad luck, which is based on the Biblical prophet Jonah. Clergymen are considered bad luck, as they are all of Jonah's ilk. Redheads and women are also to be avoided as passengers.Boating myths and superstitions =Unlucky days= Friday is considered to be an unlucky day in some cultures, and perhaps the most enduring sailing superstition is that it is unlucky to begin a voyage or 'set sail' on a Friday. However, this superstition is not universal. In the 19th century Admiral William Henry Smyth, writing in his nautical lexicon The Sailor's Word-Book, described Friday as (Dies Infaustus means \\"unlucky day\\".) This superstition is the root of the well-known urban legend of . Sailors are often reluctant to set sail on Candlemas Day, believing that any voyage begun then will end in disaster. This may be related to the superstition to remove all Christmas decorations by Candlemas, a practice done well into Victorian times. In 18th century New England, rolling clouds and roaring waves were thought as bad omens, so sailing on days under such conditions was considered inadvisable. =Sirens and Scylla= Odysseus and the Sirens, eponymous vase of the Siren Painter, ca. 480-470 BC, (British Museum) The Siren, by John William Waterhouse (circa 1900), depicted as a fish-chimera. Sirens were mythological, often dangerous and beautiful, creatures, portrayed as femmes fatales who lured nearby sailors with their enchanting music and voices to shipwreck on the rocky coast of their island. They were portrayed in both Greek and Roman mythology as sea deities who lured mariners, and in Roman lore were daughters of Phorcys.Virgil. V. 846; Ovid XIV, 88.See also Argonautica (4.891–919); Odyssey XII, 39; Hyginus, Fabulae 141; Lycophron, Alexandra 712 ff. In the Odyssey, the hero Odysseus, wishing to hear the sirens' seductive and destructive song, must protect himself and his crew by having his fellow sailors tie him to the mast and then stop their own ears with wax (see image). In another myth, Hera, queen of the gods, persuaded the Sirens to enter a singing contest with the Muses, which the Sirens lost;Lemprière 768. out of their anguish, writes Stephanus of Byzantium, the Sirens turned white and fell into the sea at Aptera (\\"featherless\\"), where they formed the islands in the bay that were called Souda (modern Lefkai).Caroline M. Galt, \\"A marble fragment at Mount Holyoke College from the Cretan city of Aptera\\", Art and Archaeology 6 (1920:150). Scylla on the reverse of a first century B.C. denarius minted by Sextus Pompeius Another mythological creature, the Scylla, is a similar female sea demon that is both dangerous yet beautiful. Sirens supposedly \\"lured mariners to their deaths with their melodious, enchanting song\\", while \\"Scylla sent countless sailors to the depths of the sea.\\" On a related note, it was considered bad luck to have women on board, due to the potential for distractions which in turn would anger the sea gods and cause bad weather. =Albatross= The albatross as a superstitious relic is referenced in Samuel Taylor Coleridge's well-known poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. It is considered very unlucky to kill an albatross; in Coleridge's poem, the narrator killed the bird and his fellow sailors eventually force him to wear the dead bird around his neck. =Banana= Having bananas on a ship, especially on a private boat or fishing yacht, is considered bad luck. =Whistling= Whistling is usually considered to be bad luck with the possible exception of the sources mentioned below. It is said that to whistle is to challenge the wind itself, and that to do so will bring about a storm. Another tale is that it has been considered bad luck ever since the mutiny aboard HMS Bounty; Fletcher Christian is said to have used a whistle as the signal to begin the mutiny against Captain William Bligh. =Ceremonial ship launching= During the christening ceremony for a ship, it is considered inauspicious if the bottle of champagne fails to break the first time it is swung against the hull. Good luck Sailors also had a culture of items or practices that were believed to bring good luck, or trinkets to ward off bad luck or the evil eye. =Cats= Tiddles, a black cat who gained fame as a Royal Navy ship's cat While in many cultures, a black cat is considered unlucky, British and Irish sailors considered adopting a black \\"ship's cat\\" because it would bring good luck. There is some logic to this belief: cats eat (or at least kill) rodents, which can damage ropes and stores of grain on board, and they are intelligent animals, a high level of care was directed toward them to keep them happy, and research has backed up this superstition. Evidence published in 2017 by a geneticist the University of Leuven shows that Egyptian cats spread their mitochondrial DNA through shipping lanes to medieval northern Europe. Preliminary results of that genetic study concluded that cats were also carried on trading ships to control rodents, and that practice was adopted by traders from other nations, including Vikings in northern Germany around the 8th to 11th centuries. Some sailors believed that polydactyl cats were better at catching pests, possibly connected with the suggestion that extra digits give a polydactyl cat better balance, important when at sea. Cats were believed to have miraculous powers that could protect ships from dangerous weather. Another popular belief was that cats could start storms through magic stored in their tails. If a ship's cat fell or was thrown overboard, it was thought that it would summon a terrible storm to sink the ship and that if the ship was able to survive, it would be cursed with nine years of bad luck. Other beliefs included: if a cat licked its fur against the grain, it meant a hailstorm was coming; if it sneezed it meant rain; and if it was frisky it meant wind. =Cormorants= Cormorants, in some Scandinavian areas, are considered a good omen; in particular, in Norwegian tradition spirits of those lost at sea come to visit their loved ones disguised as cormorants. =Whistling= Whistling on board a sailing ship is thought to encourage the wind strength to increase. This is regularly alluded to in the Aubrey–Maturin books by Patrick O'Brian. On boats and ships whistling was taboo as it was associated with coded communications between mutineers. The cook was usually excused, because as long as he was whistling, he was not stealing the food. =Klabautermann= A Klabautermann on a ship, from Buch Zur See, 1885 Traditionally, a type of kobold, called a Klabautermann, lives aboard ships and helps sailors and fishermen on the Baltic and North Sea in their duties. He is a merry and diligent creature, with an expert understanding of most watercraft, and an irrepressible musical talent. He also rescues sailors washed overboard. The name comes from the Low German verb klabastern meaning \\"rumble\\" or \\"make a noise\\". An etymology deriving the name from the verb kalfatern (\\"to caulk\\") has also been suggested.Leander Petzoldt, Kleines Lexikon der Dämonen und Elementargeister, Becksche Reihe, 1990, p. 109. A carved klabautermann image, of a small sailor dressed in yellow with a tobacco pipe and woollen sailor's cap, often carrying a caulking hammer, is attached to the mast as a symbol of good luck. However, despite the positive attributes, there is one omen associated with his presence: no member of a ship blessed by his presence shall ever set eyes on him; he only ever becomes visible to the crew of a doomed ship.Melville, F., The Book of Faeries (2002 Quarto Publishing). The belief in Klabautermänner dates to at least the 1770s.Ellett, Mrs. (Jan. 1846). \\"Traditions and Superstitions\\", The American Whig Review: A Whig Journal, Vol. III. New York: George H. Colton. pp. 107-108.Rose, Carol (1996). Spirits, Fairies, Leprechauns, and Goblins: An Encyclopedia. New York City: W. W. Norton & Company, Inc. . p. 181. =Patron saints= Sailors have had several patron saints. According to his hagiography, Saint Nicholas calmed a storm by prayer. Brendan the Navigator is also considered a patron saint of sailors and navigators, due to his mythical voyage to St. Brendan’s Island. Erasmus of Formiae, also known as Saint Elmo, may have become the patron of sailors because he is said to have continued preaching even after a thunderbolt struck the ground beside him. This prompted sailors, who were in danger from sudden storms and lightning, to claim his prayers. The electrical discharges at the mastheads of ships were read as a sign of his protection and came to be called \\"Saint Elmo's Fire\\".Eyers, Jonathan (2011). Don't Shoot the Albatross!: Nautical Myths and Superstitions. A&C; Black, London, UK. .St. Erasmus (St. Elmo) Catholic Online. Retrieved 2012-03-07. Thus, Saint Elmo's Fire was usually good luck in traditional sailor's lore, but because it is a sign of electricity in the air and interferes with compass readings, sailors sometimes regarded it as an omen of bad luck and stormy weather.Beliefs often can be contradictory. For example, St. Elmo's fire is reported to have been seen during the Siege of Constantinople by the Ottoman Empire in 1453. It reportedly was seen emitting from the top of the Hippodrome. The Byzantines attributed it to a sign that the Christian God would soon come and destroy the conquering Muslim army. According to George Sphrantzes, it disappeared just days before Constantinople fell, ending the Byzantine Empire. The mariner's cross, also referred to as St. Clement's Cross, is worn by many sailors to bring blessings. =Collar-touching= It is often considered lucky to touch the collar of a sailor's suit.Encyclopedia of Superstitions 1949, Edwin Radford, Mona A. Radford, Kessinger Publishing (p. 208) =Mermaids and mermen= Mermaids usually are considered lucky, but not universally. In Trinidad and Tobago, sea-dwelling mer-men \\"were known to grant a wish, transform mediocrity into genius and confer wealth and power.\\" Mermaids appear in British folklore as unlucky omens, both foretelling disaster and provoking it.Katharine Briggs, An Encyclopedia of Fairies, Hobgoblins, Brownies, Boogies, and Other Supernatural Creatures, \\"Mermaids\\", p 287. Several variants of the ballad Sir Patrick Spens depict a mermaid speaking to the doomed ships. In some versions, she tells them they will never see land again; in others, she claims they are near shore, which they are wise enough to know means the same thing. Mermaids can also be a sign of approaching rough weather,Francis James Child, The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, v 2, p 19, New York: Dover, 1965 and some have been described as monstrous in size, up to . Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale \\"The Little Mermaid\\" was published in 1837. The story was adapted into a Disney film with a bowdlerized plot. In the original version, The Little Mermaid is the youngest daughter of a sea king who lives at the bottom of the sea. To pursue a prince with whom she has fallen in love, the mermaid gets a sea witch to give her legs and agrees to give up her tongue in return. Though she is found on the beach by the prince, he marries another. Told she must stab the prince in the heart to return to her sisters, she can't do it out of love for him. She then rises from the ocean and sees ethereal beings around her who explain that mermaids who do good deeds become daughters of the air, and after 300 years of good service they can earn a human soul. A world-famous statue of the Little Mermaid, based on Andersen's fairy tale, has been in Copenhagen, Denmark since August 1913, with copies in 13 other locations around the world. Sailors would look for mermaid's purses on beaches for signs of mermaids in the area. Lore, mythology, and stories An illustration from the original 1870 edition of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea by author Jules Verne. Davy Jones is a popular character in sailor's yore, especially of the gothic fictional variety. Davy Jones' Locker is an idiom for the bottom of the sea: the state of death among drowned sailors. It is used as a euphemism for death or burial at sea (to be sent to Davy Jones' Locker). The origins of the name are unclear, and many theories have been put forth, including an actual David Jones, who was a pirate on the Indian Ocean in the 1630s; a pub owner who kidnapped sailors and then dumped them onto any passing ship; the incompetent Duffer Jones, a notoriously myopic sailor who often found himself over-board; or that Davy Jones is another name for Satan; or \\"Devil Jonah\\", the biblical Jonah who became the \\"evil angel\\" of all sailors, who would identify more with the beset-upon ship-mates of Jonah than with the unfortunate man himself. Upon death, a wicked sailor's body supposedly went to Davy Jones' locker (a chest, as lockers were back then), but a pious sailor's soul went to Fiddler's Green. This nautical superstition was popularized in the 19th century. Kraken were legendary sea monsters that may have been based on sightings of giant squids. Practices and semiotics In relation to language and cultural practices, such sailors' superstitions are the consequence of folkloric practices or traditions whose meanings were once important signifiers, but now are lost to most modern sailors and laypersons alike. =Sailor tattoos= Tattooed sailor aboard the USS New Jersey, 1944 Sailor tattoos are a visual way to preserve the culture of the maritime superstitions. Sailors believed that certain symbols and talismans would help them in when facing certain events in life; they thought that those symbols would attract good luck or bad luck in the worst of the cases: For example, the images of a pig and a hen were good luck; both animals are not capable of swimming, but they believed that God would look down upon a shipwreck and see an animal not capable of swimming and would take them into his hand and place them on land. In reality, most of the smaller livestock aboard ships would float in their wooden crates and would be among the only survivors of wrecks, adding further reason to getting the tattoos on sailors' feet, as it was believed to help them survive a wreck. Another example of superstitions is the North Star (Nautical Star or compass rose); sailors had the belief that by wearing this symbol it would help them to find his or her way home. Sailors designed mariner motifs of their own, according to their travel experiences in the ocean. By the 19th century, about 90% of all United States Navy sailors had tattoos. The anchor is commonly used in sailor tattoos, which were supposed to prevent a sailor from floating away from the ship, should he fall overboard. The words 'HOLD FAST' tattooed on the knuckles would prevent a sailor from falling from aloft. =Line-crossing= USS Blue Ridge (LCC-19) as the ship passes the Equator May 16, 2008. It has been a long naval tradition to initiate pollywogs, sailors who have never crossed the Equator, into the Kingdom of Neptune upon their first crossing of the Equator. The Line-crossing ceremony commemorates a sailor's first crossing of the Equator. Its practices invoke good luck on the new sailor. The ceremony of Crossing the Line is an initiation rite in the Royal Navy, Royal Canadian Navy, U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Marine Corps, and other navies that commemorates a sailor's first crossing of the Equator. The tradition may have originated with ceremonies when passing headlands, and become a \\"folly\\" sanctioned as a boost to morale,Robert FitzRoy (1839) Narrative of the surveying voyages of His Majesty's Ships Adventure and Beagle between the years 1826 and 1836, London: Henry Colburn. pp. 57–58. or have been created as a test for seasoned sailors to ensure their new shipmates were capable of handling long rough times at sea. Sailors who have already crossed the Equator are nicknamed (Trusty) Shellbacks, often referred to as Sons of Neptune; those who have not are nicknamed (Slimy) Pollywogs (in 1832 the nickname griffins was noted Keynes, R. D. ed. (2001) Charles Darwin's Beagle diary, Cambridge University Press, pp. 36–38.). Neptune and his entourage during a Polish line-crossing ceremony (Chrzest równikowy) After crossing the line, Pollywogs receive subpoenas Ceremonial Certificates - Neptune Subpoena to appear before King Neptune and his court (usually including his first assistant Davy Jones and her Highness Amphitrite and often various dignitaries, who are all represented by the highest ranking seamen), who officiate at the ceremony, which is often preceded by a beauty contest of men dressing up as women. Afterwards, some wogs may be \\"interrogated\\" by King Neptune and his entourage. During the ceremony, the Pollywogs undergo a number of increasingly embarrassing ordeals (such as wearing clothing inside out and backwards; crawling on hands and knees; being swatted with short lengths of firehose; kissing the Royal Baby's belly coated with axle grease, etc.), largely for the entertainment of the Shellbacks. Once the ceremony is complete, a Pollywog receives a certificate Ceremonial Certificates - Golden Shellback Certificate - Personalized declaring his new status. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt described his Crossing the Line ceremony aboard the \\"Happy Ship\\" USS Indianapolis with his \\"Jolly Companions\\" in a letter to his wife Eleanor Roosevelt on 26 November 1936: some cruise ships also have a line-crossing ceremony for their passengers. =Over a barrel= Punishment of the Paddle, 1912 The phrase over a barrel, meaning to be in a dilemma or \\"a weak or difficult position\\", may refer to the first aid practice amongst sailors of placing a drowning victim's head over a barrel, and rolling his body over it, in an attempt to remove aspirated water from the person's lungs. However, this etymology is challenged, and may come instead from the custom of punishing a prisoner by flogging or paddling him while he is strapped to a barrel; there is no documentary evidence it was actually used specifically as a nautical phrase. Either way, the image created in the mind is that of total helplessness and loss of control, which is a common anxiety of sailors in fear of corporal punishment.  Theories as to origins  Many theories have formed as to explain these phemonem and why they exist. Jakob Jakobsen theorised that such practices existed with the intent to confuse and ward off fairies and protect the sailors. Lockwood concurred as well with the general line of thought and concluded it was also done so as to not summon dangerous animals such as whales or ravens. Solheim follows this same line of thought and considers it also be done to protect loved ones back on land from such animals and spirits. Bairbre Ní Fhloinn critiques this line of thought concluding it to be reductionist and insulting to the intelligence of fishermen however she does admit it may be a factor.

She succeeded Beatrice Weder di Mauro and is the second female member of the council since its foundation in 1963. In a 2012 interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Buch held that “Eurobonds in the framework of a political union, with joint control and a surrendering of fiscal powers, would be theoretically an alternative in the long term.” While calling such as solution “politically unrealistic,” she promoted the debt-redemption fund as an alternative to European Central Bank monetization of sovereign debt. The fund, which would mutualize euro-area debt exceeding 60 percent of member states’ economic output in return for strict conditions, would offer a temporary solution until the bloc stabilize its finances, Buch told the newspaper.Patrick Donahue (July 18, 2012), Merkel Adviser Calls Political Union Unrealistic, FAZ Says Bloomberg News.

It is among the most distinctive of Breuer's residential designs, as Wolfson requested that Breuer integrate his 37-foot 1948 Spartan Royal Mansion trailer as one wing of the house, which Breuer initially resisted before agreeing to. The house features many Breuer hallmarks: cantilevered living space, central fireplace made of native stone, and natural wood finishes. The house sits on 20 acres of land abutting Wappingers Creek in Dutchess County north of New York City. In 1950, a separate artist's studio was added to the property.

The Hive was the first library in Europe to house both a university book collection and a public lending library replacing the City of Worcester library in The Tything and the University of Worcester's Peirson library. It was opened to the public on 2 July 2012 and officially opened by HM Queen Elizabeth II in her Diamond Jubilee year (12 July 2012). The library houses over a quarter of a million books including substantial children's & academic libraries, whilst the secure archive provides storage to over 12 miles (19 km) of archive collections including William Shakespeare’s marriage bond to Anne Hathaway and more than 45,000 records of historic monuments and buildings. The Hive is also home to Worcestershire County Council customer services \\"Worcestershire Hub\\"; a business centre; café; and, meeting facilities. There are a total of 350 computers distributed around the building, for joint use by members of the public and the university's students. Public use WiFi connectivity is also provided. The award-winning design of the building uses advanced environmental technology to improve sustainability, including computer controlled ventilation & river water cooling negating the use of a traditional air conditioning system. A bio-mass boiler is provided for heating as required. Background and finances Costing £60-million, The Hive was the subject of a complex private finance initiative programme, which brought together the designers with the building contractors Galliford Try Ltd and the mechanical and electrical engineering consultants Max Fordham LLP. Originally developed in Australia in the 1980s, PFI is a method of procuring the design and construction of major public buildings by using private sector funding and contracting services. The Hive's joint commissioning clients were the University of Worcester and Worcestershire County Council. Funding was also provided by the National Lottery and the British government's Department for Culture, Media and Sport and Department for Education. Visitors The Hive received 968,105 visitors in its first year of operation. With 94.5 hours a week of operation, Monday to Sunday 8.30am - 10pm, it is thought to have the longest weekly operating hours of any library in the UK. According to the Annual Public Library Statistics from the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA), The Hive issued 903,859 books during the financial year 2013/14 and achieved 978,199 visits. This has placed it top in the West Midlands for both of the aforementioned statistics, second in the country for the number of books loaned, and fourth for visit numbers just two years after opening, beating both Oxford Central Library and Cambridge Central Library.http://www.cipfa.org/about-cipfa/press-office/latest-press- releases/worcester-library-most-popular-in-the-west-midlands External appearance Aerial view of The Hive and surrounding landscape The Hive has a unique external appearance, created by its gold-coloured cladding and distinctive roof profile, formed by seven upward-facing 'cones'. The Hive can be viewed from many vantage points across the city and sits in strong contrast to the majority of the city’s medieval, Georgian and Victorian architecture. The cones are one of the many design features which earned the building a BREEAM 'Outstanding' rating, and were inspired by the outline of the popular Malvern Hills and the kilns of Royal Worcester Porcelain. 60x60 cm alloy 'tiles', made from recycled copper, cover more than 11,000 sqm of the building's walls and roof. The cladding which covers The Hive's horizontal facades is interrupted by large areas of double glazing in order to let as much natural light as possible into the interior. History of the site As well as being the county's primary repository of archaeological finds, The Hive is sited on a historic part of the city of Worcester. The area's name, The Butts, refers to the open edge-of-city space knows as Archery butts which were designated for longbow archery practice in medieval times (23 UK towns still retain this as a place name); evidence of Roman iron ore smelting was discovered and preserved; and in Victorian times part of the site housed the city's cattle market. Layout and public facilities The total floor area of the 5-storey building covers 13,253 sqm. Located at the southernmost point of the city centre, The Hive adjoins the line of the old city wall and overlooks the River Severn. Level 0 'Shared Study' – Social Study Area, Games, Film and Music The public area of Level 0 was designed with teen-age people in mind. The space offers lots of group study station and also group study screens together with books aimed at teen-age readers. This level also houses The Hive's DVD, CD and graphic novel collections. The other half of Level 0 houses the county's archive stores, conservation department and archaeological services, is one metre above the Severn's 100-year flood level, though flood prevention safeguards have been incorporated into the structure and the adjoining landscaping. More than 26,000 records are stored in seven climate-controlled strongrooms, including the Marriage Bond between William Shakespeare and Anne Hathaway, dated 28 November 1582. Level 1 'Discover' – Worcestershire Hub, Children & Families, Quick Choice & Reservations, Café & Shop, The Studio A large paved forecourt leads to The Hive's main public entrance, a naturally- lit central atrium paved with stone from the Forest of Dean, with The Hub, a café and a spacious colourful Children's Library all set around a staircase finished in Ash wood. This is one continuous flight of 42 steps, interrupted only by three intermediate landings, which rises up through the whole building. Its structural support is provided by cross-laminated timber panels, making it an all-wood entity. FCBS's colour consultant Libby Lloyd has introduced a vivid palette into the children's spaces; many 'borrowed' from historic ranges produced by the city's famous Royal Worcester potteries, including a chrome yellow Story Pit, small timber-framed alcoves for parent- child reading and a castellated outdoor Story Island. Level 2 'Explore The Past' – Archives & Archaeology, Meeting Rooms 1 – 6, Business Centre 'Explore the Past' is the theme of the building's second level, with a number of display and presentation techniques used around the open-plan area, including pendant 'sound domes' replaying recorded extracts from the county's sound archive of oral history. This floor also houses local reference library books. Level 3 – 'Read, Learn, Imagine' – Main Public & University Library, Meeting Rooms 7 & 8 The Hive's principal public lending and reference library is located on this floor as are many of the public use computers. Over 200,000 volumes are housed in book stacks whose ends contain glass-sided display cases. A comfy seating area with views over the river Severn and an area for magazine and newspaper reading are provided. Level 4 'Research, quiet study' Special Collections, Journals This much smaller floor is built into one of the roof cones and contains a silent study area for those who prefer together with the Hive's Special Collections including: The Stuart Collection' Over one-thousand books concerned with the period of history in which Britain was under the rule of the House of Stuart (1603-1714). This collection was bequeathed to Worcester City Library in 1900 by John Grainger, a book seller in the City of Worcester. The Stanbrook Abbey Collection - A collection of publications made by the Stanbrook Abbey Press. Design features The Hive during construction in June 2011 The building uses renewable energy and has recycling facilities throughout. Designers sought to make the building's form and fabric temper the internal environment, thus minimising the need for mechanical systems. Where these are required they were specified to have a minimal environmental impact and to make maximum use of renewable resources. The building was designed to be well sealed and insulated to avoid incidental losses, and glazing and shading devices are orientated to minimise unnecessary gains. The building makes maximum use of controlled natural light and ventilation with controls and local manual override. Materials were selected to minimise embodied energy and generation of toxins in manufacture, use and ultimate disposal. Where possible materials were recycled and locally sourced and the design allows for the building structure and fabric to be recycled at the end of its life. Water use is minimised by the specification of water saving fittings and the recycling of grey water. Green travel is facilitated via cycle parking, provision of staff showers and excellent connections to public transport. In all public areas the heating and cooling is controlled automatically to maintain comfortable room temperatures. The majority of heating and cooling is by radiant effect from the concrete ceilings which have pipework embedded in them, while the building itself is naturally ventilated by automatic windows, controlled by carbon dioxide and temperature sensors. Sustainability The environmental brief given to the design team was that a 50% renewable energy figure had to be achieved for The Hive, which would have been difficult considering the anticipated popularity of the building. To accommodate the energy demands expected from climate changes, the building's environmental needs were 'future proofed' on UK meteorological projections up to the year 2050. In modern business practice the term Synergy is sometimes used to explain how the resulting conclusion of a successful operation can turn out to be greater than the sum of the constituent parts. The American Buckminster Fuller was the first western philosopher and futurologist to use this term in an architectural context, with particular reference to the energy efficiency and sustainability of buildings. The popularity of The Hive and the meeting of its challenging energy performance targets may yet lead this library to become one of the few UK examples of synergy in a public building. The building is not conventionally air conditioned because the production of the electricity used to make and operate air conditioners has an environmental impact, including the release of greenhouse gasses. Instead, air flows around the perimeter of The Hive through opening windows. Air makes its way towards the main atrium and other voids where it rises to roof level and is exhausted through the roof vents. The seven roof-mounted cones encourage the upward movement of stale air by stack effect, mechanically aided a large below-ground duct which supplies air naturally to the bottom of the main atrium space. To safeguard against contra-flows created by external wind turbulence, which might negate this stack effect, the architects commissioned a scale model of one of the cones to be tested in a wind tunnel at Cardiff University. The predominant wind direction is from the South-West which means that air is blown over the river and the water meadow provided as part of the landscape in front of the building. There is some degree of evaporative cooling which reduces the air-temperature of the incoming air. Exposed concrete soffits provide the majority of the thermal mass and these are pre-cooled by the night-time cooling strategy. In very hot weather when the natural ventilation can no longer maintain the required conditions, cool water (fed by the river cooling system) is circulated around either chilled beams or pipes embedded in the concrete slab to provide further cooling. The building was designed to make maximum use of daylight, both to provide a bright environment and also to reduce energy consumption. The large window areas and 'sky-lights' in the roof cones provide sufficient natural light for low-energy electric lighting to be kept to a minimum, reducing both energy demands and ambient heat creation. Artificial lighting typically represents around 30% of a building’s energy use. The required quietness levels needed in The Hive's extensive study areas are achieved through vertical decorative Ash 'fins' mounted on sound absorption blankets fixed to the structure's concrete soffits, and acoustic panels positioned strategically all around the building. The main heating source in winter is a 550 kW biomass boiler, with emergency back-up being provided by three 250 kW gas-fired boilers. In extreme summer conditions, river water is pumped into the basement of the building, passed across concrete heat exchangers, with the cooled air ducted up into the central atrium. Temperature checks are maintained on the water returned to the river to comply with the UK Environment Agency's fish protection regulations. The engineers developed a strategy which uses the River Severn as a heat sink. Water is pumped from the river to The Hive, passed through a heat exchanger and then returned to the river at only a few degrees warmer. On the other side of the heat exchanger, water is pumped around the building and used to cool the concrete slabs; the water inside the building is kept hydraulically separate from the river water to prevent contamination and blockages. Rainwater harvesting is used to serve the WC flushing and archaeological washing requirements. Neither of these require potable water and so can be fed from harvested rainwater with minimal treatment. They also represent the greatest consumptive use within the facility. Landscaping consultants Grant Associates surrounded the library with plantings of Black Pear (the county fruit of Worcestershire), black poplars, cherries, oaks, pollarded willows and medieval fruits. Tracts of wild flowers and grassed areas close to the building act as supplementary 'coolants' for fresh air being drawn in at basement level during the summer; and for fuel for The Hive's biomass boiler, a large plantation of willows has been established alongside the building. To act as flood attenuation, two water meadows are situated along the western elevation of the new building. These have been planted with a range of native wildflower species, based on communities found locally in traditional lammas meadows. Worcestershire’s county flower, the cowslip, is planted throughout. There are a number of wildlife features to provide bird nesting, bat roosting and stag beetle hibernation opportunities in the turret of Story Island. Awards The Hive won the prize for the best new-build project of the year in the Chartered Institute of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) Building Performance Awards 2013. It was shortlisted alongside six other buildings including the Titanic in Belfast and Gardens by the Bay in Singapore. The Hive was recognised for its good practice, energy performance use of passive design and renewable technologies to create a sustainable building while delivering a high level of comfort and performance for its visitors.http://www.worcesternews.co.uk/archive/2013/02/12/Business+%28ks_news_business%29/10220469.The_Hive_causes_a_buzz_as_it_takes_buildings_crown/ The building scooped Sustainable Project of the Year in the Building Awards 2013, fighting off stiff competition from seven other contenders. The critics described the Hive as “truly impressive”, praising its design, which is based on allowing as much sunlight into the building as possible. They were also impressed by the gold-clad cones which contain glazed rooflights and vertical glazing, as well as the low energy lighting. The use of the river Severn for water chillers, and a rainwater tank, that collects water dripping off the roof to flush the toilets were also factors in the award.http://www.worcesternews.co.uk/news/10389950.Hive_s_green_themehelps_it_land_award/ Outstanding Library Team http://www.worcester.ac.uk/discover/university-wins- prestigious-times-higher-award.html \\\\- Times Higher Leadership and Management Award - June 2013 National Award and Regional Award - RIBA - May 2013 Sustainability Award - RIBA Awards West Midlands - May 2013 Award for Design and Innovation - RICS Awards West Midlands - May 2013 Community Benefit Award - RICS Awards West Midlands - May 2013 Sustainable Project of the Year http://www.building.co.uk/home/events/building-events/sustainable-project-of- the-year-2013/5053586.article\\\\- Building Magazine - April 2013 Civic Trust Award http://www.civictrustawards.org.uk/winners/2013/CTA006822/\\\\- March 2013 Contribution to the local community through The Hive http://www.thehiveworcester.org/10064.html\\\\- Guardian University Award - February 2013 New build project of the year (value above £5 million) http://www.thehiveworcester.org/10033.html\\\\- CIBSE - February 2013 Building Excellence Award http://www.worcester.gov.uk/index.php?id=338&tx;_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=1298\\\\- South Worcestershire Building Control - 2012 Building of the year - Post Tensioned Society Awards - 2012 BREEAM Outstanding 86.4% http://www.breeam.org/page.jsp?id=546\\\\- June 2012 Best Sustainability in a Project http://www.thehiveworcester.org/the-hive- scoops-national-sustainability-award.html\\\\- Public Private Partnership Awards - May 2012 West Midlands Regional Planning Award -2012 Innovation in Generative Design - Bentley Be Inspired: Infrastructure Best Practices Symposium and Awards - October 2009 Further reading Better Public Libraries; Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment; 2003 RIBA Journal; April 2012 CIBSE Journal; March 2013 References External links * The Hive website * University of Worcester, Library Services * Architects : Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios * Engineers : Max Fordham * Buildings and structures in Worcester, England Libraries established in 2012 Libraries in Worcestershire ","title":"The Hive, Worcester"},{"id":"36534571","title":"Dailenys Alcántara"},{"id":"36534574","text":"Norbert Erdős (born October 25, 1972) is a Hungarian politician and Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from Hungary.

His early work focused on social and institutional factors shaping the diffusion of technology-based teaching. Since 2007, his work has focused on web-based compassion and world suffering. Personal History While born in Sikeston, Missouri, from 1944 to 1953 he lived in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. He graduated from La Sierra University in Riverside, CA with a BA in psychology, and from Stanford University with a PhD in sociology in 1970. In 1968, he accepted a faculty position at the University of Minnesota and still resides in the Minneapolis area. Professional History and Honors During most of his professional career, Dr. Anderson actively contributed in three distinct disciplines: sociology, educational research, and computer science. While his publications reside within the intersection of these fields, he has received honors or awards for outstanding service from the principal professional associations of each of these three fields: American Sociological Association, the American Educational Research Association, and the Association for Computing Machinery. In 2001, he was awarded the Outstanding Service AwardAwards — SIGCAS – Computers & Society by the Special Interest Group for Computers and SocietySIGCAS Mission — SIGCAS – Computers & Society of the Association for Computing Machinery. In 1990, he became an invited member of Sociological Research Association; and in 2008, he became an invited FellowAERA Fellows of the American Educational Research Association. In August, 2012, the Communication and Information Technology Section[4] of the American Sociological Association will honor him with the prestigious William F. Ogburn Lifetime Achievement AwardAwards  CITASA Secondary (Re-purposed) Survey Data Analysis Ron Anderson learned secondary data analysis skills from his mentor, Stuart C. Dodd at the University of Washington in 1963, and his advisor, John W. Meyer at Stanford University. Anderson applied these skills with John O. Field to study how ideology influenced presidential elections. The resulting paper,Field, J. O. & Anderson, R. E. (1969) \\"Ideology in the Public's Con-ceptualization of the 1964 Election,\\" Public Opinion Quarterly 33, pp. 380-398 published in the Public Opinion Quarterly, was reprinted in several major political science texts and was discussed at length by Herbert Hyman, who considered the Anderson-Field link between theoretical analysis and creative mining of secondary data resources to be exemplary and a contribution to both theory and data analysis methodology.Hyman, Herbert (1970) Second¬ary Analysis of Sample Surveys, pp. 185-191. In 1981, Anderson received a grant from the National Science Foundation to conduct secondary analysis of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) of science and math. One of the papers from this project was published in 1984 and was the first report on the digital divide in the United States using large-scale, national survey data.R. Anderson, L. Harris, W. Welch (1984) “Inequities in Opportunities for Computer Literacy,\\" The Computing Teacher, 11, 8, pp 10-13. The term digital divide did not appear in the literature or the media until 11 years later. These results, with lengthy quotes from Anderson, who directed the US portion of the study, were widely disseminated in the popular media including articles in the New York Times,“Richer Schools Likelier to Obtain Computers” New York Times (Sept 6, 1983). the Washington Post,“Computers Give Poor Kids New Handicap” The Washington Post (Front page, September 12, 1983). Business Week,“If women don’t go into Computers” Business Week (June 21, 1982) the Wall Street Journal,“Courses in Computer Literacy Beginning to Draw Bad Marks,” The Wall Street Journal (Sept. 16, 1983) and Ms. Magazine.“Do Schools Teach Computer Anxiety?” Ms. Magazine (December 1982) In the academic literature, Anderson is reported as “explicating the depth of the digital divide in shaping the adolescent life course.”Mortimer, J T. and Larson, R. W. in The Changing Adolescent Experience (2002), . While the media focused upon the findings of sex and income gaps in access and computer course enrollments, Anderson and his associates also found major differences by race and region. Thirty years later, researchers continue to find major gaps (digital divides) in the demographics of the use of information technologyAnderson, R. E. & Ainley, J.

In 1981, Anderson founded and served as Director of the Minnesota Center for Survey Research.Minnesota Center for Survey Research: http://oms.umn.edu/mcsr/. He served in that capacity for five years and started the Minnesota State Survey and the Twin Cities Area Survey, both of which are still conducted annually by the Center, which is a unit of the University of Minnesota. During the next two decades, Anderson continued survey work but mostly cross-nationally, which is described in later sections below. Computing Applications in Research and Teaching In the late 1960s, Anderson worked full-time as a computer programmer at the Stanford University Computation Center, now called Information Technology Services. Throughout his career as a sociologist, he also worked as a computer consultant developing applications for many educational, governmental and business organizations.Vita of Ronald Anderson: http://www.soc.umn.edu/~rea/documents/ron%20anderson%20vita%20full%20%2022july2012.pdf Many of publications by Anderson (125 articles, 4 books authored, and 5 books edited) describe and critique the use of computers and new media in research, teaching, and learning.Vita of Ronald Anderson: http://www.soc.umn.edu/~rea/documents/ron%20anderson%20vita%20full%20%2022july2012.pdf. He also (with David Garson) has served as Co-Editor of the Sage Publishing academic journal, Social Science Computer Review, since 1987.Social Science Computer Review =Simulation Modeling= Ronald Anderson pioneered the development of two major simulation models. The first provides scenario-based analysis of the impacts of changing sentencing laws. This work started in 1979 for the Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines CommissionMinnesota Sentencing Guidelines Commission: http://www.msgc.state.mn.us/. and the [Minnesota Department of Corrections] (MDOC). It consisted of a [microsimulation] model of the effects of hypothetical changes in sentencing laws upon prison and probation populations. The model, now called the Structured Sentencing Simulation,Anderson, R. E.(1993) \\"Development of a Structured Sentencing Simulation,\\" Social Science Computer Review 11,2 pp. 166-178.http://www.nccourts.org/Courts/CRS/Councils/spac/Documents/2011-popproj.pdf. is still used by [Minnesota] and [North Carolina] in prison population projections and “what if” scenario simulations. His second major simulation work, between 2009 and 2012, addresses college student retention. He and demographer, Dr. Martin Spielauer,Martin Spielauer: http://www.spielauer.ca/ developed a computer model called MicroCC.Spielauer, M. & Anderson, R. E. (2012) “Microsimulation Modeling of Student Success in Community Colleges Using MicroCC,” Social Science Computer Review 30, 4 (Nov 2012) pp499-512. It was developed under a grant from the [National Science Foundation], and has been applied to 250,000 community college students in New England.DECA report on community college student progress: http://www.colorado.edu/ibs/decaproject/pubs/Report%20on%20Feasibility%20of%20Using%20SURs%20for%20ATE%20Retention%20v2%206july10.pdf. =Educational Software= During the 1970s and 80s, Anderson pioneered educational software applications for social science teaching and research. He developed over 50 applications that were distributed by Random House, Longman Publishing, and Control Data Corporation. Some of the more popular titles include Social Indicators Game, The Public Opinion Exercise: American Sexual Values and Social Power Game.Magnuson-Martinson, Scott (1995) \\"Classroom Computerization: Ambivalent Attitudes and Ambiguous Outcomes.\\" Teaching Sociology. 23:1-7. The latter game received the NCRIPTAL/EDUCOM Higher Education Distinguished Software Award in 1987. =Lectures on New Media in Education= Principally during the 1980s and 1990s, Anderson gave invited lectures on using new media, which includes educational technology and instructional technology, to teachers and administrators in both secondary and postsecondary institutions as well as national educational organizations. The latter included the Ministry of Education (Singapore), Japan’s National Institute for Educational Policy Research,Japan’s National Institute for Educational Policy Research: http://www.nier.go.jp/English/index.html and the Ministry of Education and Research (Norway). Within the United States, his lectures included the National Academy of Sciences, Eastern Montana College, University of Akron, University of Dayton, Ball State University, and Eastern Michigan University. Social Implications of Technology During the 1970s, Professor Anderson published a number of articles on the ways in which the social context of computing shaped its use and development. In his writing on the social aspects and implications of computing, he persistently emphasized the need for research data for making decisions about the implementation of computer technology. The ACM Digital Library contains 33 articles by Anderson with a total of 982 citations and 617 downloads in 2012 alone.ACM Digital Library: http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100104145&CFID;=85046073&CFTOKEN;=10671748 With funding from the National Science Foundation to the Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium, Ron Anderson and Dan Klassen conducted the first large- scale survey, which surveyed the nearly 7,000 Minnesota high school teachers of math and science regarding their use of computers in teaching.[29] They found that in 1978, before the release of the PC, half of the teachers used computers in their classes and the social context and social attributes of the teachers determined computer utilization.Anderson, R.E., Hansen, T., Johnson, D.C., and Klassen, D.L.(1979) \\"Acceptance and Rejection of Instructional Computing by Secondary School Teachers,\\" Sociology of Work and Occupations 6,2 pp 227-250. In 1982, then U.S. Congressman Al Gore invited Anderson to participate in the “Computers and Education Hearings” of the Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight of the House Science and Technology CommitteeSubcommittee on Investigations and Oversight of the U. S. House Science and Technology Committee: http://science.house.gov/subcommittee- investigations-and-oversight in Washington, D.C., on September 29, 1983. The full Statement of Dr. Ronald E. Anderson before the Subcommittee can be downloaded from the ACM Digital Library.Statement before the Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight of the House Science and Technology Committee on 1984 The statement emphasized differences in the implementation of computer utilization in schools based upon social and demographic factors, and the need for local and national evidence-based accountability. In 1980, Anderson became the founding Chair of the Section of the American Sociological Association that is now called “Communication and Information Technologies” (CITASA)ASA Section on Communication & Information Technologies (CITASA) Barry Wellman describes Anderson’s organizing role as a stalwart of the technology movement within sociology.Wellman, B. (2006). “CITASA” Social Science Computer Review 24,2, 150-157. In 1992, Anderson under the auspices of the ACM organized a conference on “Computers and the Quality of Life,” the first conference to link IT with quality of life issues. The Conference Proceedings is still downloadable at the ACM Digital Library and was downloaded 414 times in 2012.Proceedings of the conference on Computers and the quality of life: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=97344&coll;=DL&dl;=GUIDE&CFID;=85046073&CFTOKEN;=10671748. In 2000, the Association for Computing Machinery Council appointed Anderson to represent ACM and the United States on the 30-nation Technical Committee (TC9) on “Relationship between Computers and Society”TC9 of IFIPS: http://ifiptc9.csir.co.za/ of the International Federation of Information Processing Societies (IFIPS). He served in that capacity for five years. The principal products of this international Committee during that time was to hold two symposia and collectively author a book entitled Perspectives and Policies on ICT in Society, which was published by Springer in 2007.Berleur, J. & Avgerou, C.,(2005) Perspectives and Policies on ICT in Society. New York: Springer. =Code of Ethics for the Computing Professions= During the 1980s, Anderson held several leadership positions in the [Association for Computing Machinery] (ACM), the principle association of computer scientists and computing professionals. He served as a Council member as well as Chair of the Special Interest Group on Computers and Society (SIGCAS)http://www.sigcas.org/awards-1. [His most important achievement within ACM was to chair the Working Group that developed the new ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. It was officially published in 1992 and remains the official ACM Code of Ethics.ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct: Communications of the ACM 35, 5 (May 1992) Pages 94–99: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=129875.129885&coll;=DL&dl;=GUIDE&CFID;=85046073&CFTOKEN;=. The ACM Digital Library Guide lists 2,393 citations of the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct in the literature since 1992.Anderson, R. E. \\"The ACM Code of Ethics: History, Process, and Implications,\\" Social Issues in Computing McGraw-Hill 1994. Following the publication of the new ACM Code of Ethics, Anderson wrote and published several articles on the ethics of computer work including an article on ethics for digital government.Anderson, R. E., \\"Social Impacts of Computing: Codes of Professional Ethics,” Social Science Computer Review 10,4 (1992). Pavlichev and Garson described his work as embodying the moral imperatives that are needed in the age of e-Government.Pavlichev, A. & Garson, G. D. (2004) Digital Government: Principles and Best Practices. Hershey PA: Idea Group Inc. Social Dynamics of Technology in Teaching and Learning In 1992, coordinated by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA),The International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA): http://www.iea.nl nearly 20 countries simultaneously surveyed (1) schools about the installed base of technology for K-12 instruction, (2) teacher practices for integrating technology into their teaching, and (3) students skills in using computers.IEA Computers in Education study: http://www.iea.nl/comped.html Anderson directed the United States portion of the study. Not only was this the first international assessment of ICT in school-based learning, but it was the first such study in the United States.R. Anderson (ed.) Computers in American Schools, 1992: An Overview, IEA Computers in Education Study, University of Minnesota, 1993. The key findings were that school computers were more outdated in the USA than in most other countries in the study and the diffusion of computer augmented learning tended to be less prevalent in lower income school districts and in highly rural areas. These results, with lengthy quotes from Anderson, who directed the US portion of the study, were widely disseminated in the popular media including articles in USA Today,Henry, Tamara (1993) “Computers serve as equalizers in schools” USA Today (front page) and Education Week.West, Peter (1993) “Survey Finds Gaps in U.S. Schools' Computer Use” Education Week (December 15, 1993) and many others. Six years later in 1998, Ron Anderson (with Henry J. Becker) conducted another national survey of schools and teachers: Teaching, Learning and Computing.Teaching, Learning and Computing:1998 The project produced 16 reports that were widely circulated. The principal findings of the study were that teacher professional identities, constructivist pedagogy, and instructionally oriented technology support were key factors in effective use of computers in teaching.Report to Participants: http://www.crito.uci.edu/tlc/findings/special_report/index.htm. =Second International Technology in Education Study (SITES)= Beginning in 1997, Dr. Anderson Co-Chaired the International Steering Committee for the first two modules of the IEA’sThe International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA): http://www.iea.nl. Second International Technology in Education Study (SITES).Second Information Technology in Education Study Module 1: http://www.iea.nl/sites-m1.htmlSecond Information Technology in Education Study Module 2: http://www.iea.nl/sites-m2.html Anderson continued with the SITES 2006 StudySecond Information Technology in Education Study 2006 (SITES 2006): http://www.iea.nl/sites_2006.html until 2007 when it ended.Law, N., Pelgrum, W.J., & Plomp, T. (Eds.). (2008). Pedagogy and ICT use in schools around the world: Findings from the IEA SITES 2006 study. Hong Kong: CERC-Springer. In 2000, Ron Anderson and Sara Dexter, directed a large national study funded by the U.S. Department of Education, \\"Exemplary Technology-Supported-Schooling Case Studies,\\" a project providing for the United States participation in both the IEA SITES Module 2 and the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) \\"case studies of reform and innovation using information technology in learning.\\"Kozma, R. (2003) Technology, Innovation and Educational Change—A Global Perspective. Eugene, OR: International Society for Technology in Education. The results of this large study of innovative exemplars of teaching with technology for the United States can be found online.USA Exemplary Case Studies: http://edtechcases.info/ =Contribution to Theories on the Social Dynamics of Technology= Ron Anderson has contributed to theories on the sociology of educational technology, especially in the areas of Diffusion of Innovations and application of Information Society concepts. In 1976, he published results about the diffusion of computer utilization among sociologists\\"Diffusion of Computer Utilization among Sociology Instructors,\\" Computers and the Humanities, 10 (1976), pp. 201-07. and in 1979 about secondary mathematics and science teachers. The former study found that while the time of adoption of computers in teaching followed an S-shaped curve as predicted by diffusion theory, the majority of applications used were not particularly innovative. In the latter study, he found that technology resources and social factors were about equally powerful in explaining adoption of technology in teaching. More interesting, however, in terms of theory was the finding that a substantial number of teachers had discontinued their use of the innovation, an aspect of the theory not yet developed.Rogers, Everett M. (1983). Diffusion of Innovations. New York: Free Press. A second area of theoretical contribution was that of theories of the information society, of which the concept of “knowledge society” is an extension. While Anderson began in the 1990s, applying information economy and knowledge management concepts to theories of what students would need in the 21st Century, his most extensive analysis was published in 2008.Anderson, R. E., (2008) “Implications of the Information and Knowledge Society for Education,” In Voogt, J. and G. Knezek (Editors) International Handbook of Information Technology in Primary and Secondary Education, Springer. Anderson introduced the concepts of tacit knowledge and tacit knowledge demand to pedagogical reform with technology. His original notions of the information society paradigm are generally accepted among those concerned with defining 21st Century Skills. The acceptance of the concept of Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) is a case in point. Evaluation Research Anderson frequently received consulting requests to evaluate educational interventions and conduct [educational research], especially with regard to the role of [information technology] in teaching. Numerous clients include: [Control Data Corporation], [Xerox Corporation], the [United States Department of Education], and the Research Grants Council, Hong Kong. For example, he reviewed test items and research designs for the Australian Center for Educational Research helping them administer the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) project. In 2004 he spent two weeks working with the [Institute for the Promotion of Teaching Science and Technology] in [Bangkok], Thailand reviewing their IT-related projects and research needs. He also has worked with several SRI International projects, funded by the [National Science Foundation] to develop performance assessments and surveys related ion the use of Information and communication technologies in education by both teachers and students. Expert Witness On several occasions, Anderson was asked to serve as an expert witness on issues related to survey research. From 2003 to 2005, he served as an expert witness for Mahoney & Foster, Ltd on an advertising fraud case.Wildlife Research Center, Inc., Plaintiff, v. Robinson Outdoors, Inc., f/k/a Robinson Laboratories, Inc., Defendant. Civil No. 02-2773(DSD/SRN) UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46701 His role included the conduct a survey of consumers of deer hunting products and critiquing the research quality of other surveys conducted. Anderson also served as an expert witness on several Change of venue hearings. One was the trial of Marjorie Congdon Caldwell Hagen for the 1977 murder of Elisabeth Congdon and her nurse in her Glensheen Historic Estate.Hendry, S. D. (1998) Glensheen’s Daughter, the Marjorie Congdon Story. Brule, WI: Cable Publishing. Another change of venue hearing in which he testified was a murder trial in which William Kunstler was involved. The hearing occurred on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in 1978.UNITED STATES, Appellee, v. James Theodore EAGLE, Appellant, No. 78-1405.

J. (Editors) Handbook of Research in New Literacies. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. Between 2014 and 2017 Springer published three of his books, all on suffering. The first was Human Suffering and Quality of Life -Conceptualizing Stories and Statistics. The second was World Suffering and the Quality of Life in 2015; and the third was Alleviation of World Suffering in 2017. The last two were anthologies including chapters written by over 25 authors in each volume. Recent Research Beginning in about 2007, Professor Anderson decided he could contribute to the common good by addressing larger societal issues rather than technology alone. He established the nonprofit Foundation for the Relief of Suffering, Inc. to develop and promoted the website WorldSuffering.org, and proceeded to write numerous articles and books on Suffering. His three books on suffering and world suffering are listed in the previou paragraph.

The album, released on 2 October 2012 via Flariella Records, comprises DeMent's first original material in sixteen years. Background The album's material has strong ties to DeMent's upbringing. According to DeMent, Sing the Delta is a reference to the Arkansas Delta, a natural region in the State of Arkansas and where her family lives. She says of the title track: \\"And that was that part of the country, the Arkansas Delta. ... A lot of what I had stamped on me — musically, Sunday-dinner-wise, religion and everything else — was a direct outgrowth of that.\\" Commenting on the sixteen-year wait between new material, DeMent has stated in an interview that she has come to terms with the fact she doesn't write new songs very often. \\"I finally made peace with that. It took me a long time, but I finally have fully accepted I’m not in charge of that. So I just made the decision to live my life.\\" In another interview, when asked what she had been doing in the sixteen years since her previous album, she quipped \\"I painted the living room a lot of different colors.\\" Critical reception Sing the Delta has largely received a positive response. Rolling Stone notes: \\"...these artisanal songs of love and doubt wear their homeliness proudly; the effect is like finding a bountiful farm stand in the middle of nowhere.\\" Stuart Munro from the Boston Globe calls the album:\\" a work of rare, unvarnished grace and power\\". The UK's The Guardian newspaper wrote that the album:\\"sounds as powerful and timeless as anything she has done\\". In addition, the review praised the quality of DeMent's songwriting. AllMusic praised DeMent's voice, saying: \\"She's a careful, detailed songwriter with a confessional edge and a good sense of narrative, and her voice is a marvelous instrument that seems to rise out of the previous century\\". The review does, however, suggests that Sing the Delta is not an album that one can often sing along to. In another glowing review, Slant Magazine's Jonothan Keefe writes: \\"DeMent's fully invested performances are lived-in and soulful, heightening the intensity of the experiences she's singing about. Over the course of Sing the Delta, DeMent confesses, wails, and testifies, and there's simply no one else in popular music who tells their truths with such urgency or clarity.\\" Track listing #\\"Go On Ahead And Go Home\\" #\\"Before The Colors Fade\\" #\\"The Kingdom Has Already Come\\" #\\"The Night I Learned How Not To Pray\\" #\\"Sing The Delta\\" #\\"If That Ain't Love\\" #\\"Livin' On The Inside\\" #\\"Makin' My Way Back Home\\" #\\"Mornin' Glory #\\"There's A Whole Lotta Heaven\\" #\\"Mama Was Always Tellin' Her Truth\\" #\\"Out Of The Fire\\" References 2012 albums Iris DeMent albums ","title":"Sing the Delta"},{"id":"36534649","text":"Amelia Earhart (1897–1937) was an American aviation pioneer and author.

A Republican, he served as a member of the Virginia State Senate, representing the 13th District, which encompasses parts of both Loudoun and Prince Williams Counties, from 2012 to 2020. Black was previously a member of the Virginia House of Delegates from 1998 to 2006. Black announced that he would not seek re-election in 2019, instead retiring at the end of his term. Early life Black was born in northern Virginia in 1944 and grew up in Miami as the middle of three children. His father was an IRS agent who helped investigate organized crime. Black's first job was working at the Miami Serpentarium, importing cobras, vipers and other venomous snakes, and preparing them for transport to zoos throughout the world. He graduated from high school in 1962 and studied at the University of Miami for a year before enlisting in the Marine Corps. Military career Black was a career military officer. He served in both the U.S. Marines and in the U.S. Army JAG Corps. He served a total of 31 years active and reserve, rising from the rank of private to full colonel. He is a graduate of the U.S. Army War College, Command and General Staff College, and Naval Aviator's Flight School. Black enlisted in the Marines in 1963 at the age of 19. He graduated from Parris Island as a PFC and entered the Marine Aviation Cadet Program at Naval Air Station Pensacola. He was commissioned a 2nd Lt. in 1965. =Vietnam= Black served as a pilot in the US Marines during the Vietnam War, earning the Purple Heart medal. He flew 269 combat helicopter missions with HMM-362, which operated out of Ky Ha, Vietnam. From 11 February to 17 June 1967, he served as Forward Air Controller for the 1st Marine Regiment, making 70 combat patrols in the jungle. He engaged in intense combat around Nui Loc Son in April 1967. He received the Navy Commendation Medal with \\"V\\" for valor, while serving as Forward Air Controller for 2nd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment. Lt. Black volunteered to join Fox Company, 1st Marines, which held the ridgeline at Nui Loc Son—an extremely dangerous and remote outpost in the Que Son Valley. =Judge Advocate General (JAG) Corps= After the war, he left the service and earned a law degree, returning to military service as a prosecutor with the U.S. Army Judge Advocate General's Corps. Black later headed the Army's Criminal Law Division at the Pentagon, before retiring from the military in 1994. In 1996, Dick Black was practicing military law in Northern Virginia. In an interview with The Washington Times, Black said despite evidence that mixed gender training leads to sexual misconduct, the Pentagon will not revert to same-sex assignments between instructors and recruits. Black said doing so \\"would be inconsistent with this tremendous drive to feminize the military today, to pretend there is no difference between the sexes.\\" Political career Black first held elective office on the Loudoun County Library Board, where in 1997 he authored a policy that blocked pornography on library computers. The policy drew national attention and First Amendment litigation struck down the policy. The United States Supreme Court ruled in 2003 in US v. American Library Association that public libraries' use of Internet filtering software does not violate their patrons' First Amendment rights. Today Loudoun County Public libraries do contain internet filters, but allow adult patrons to turn them off provided they read and sign the LCPL Adult Internet Use Agreement to register to use the Internet, and by doing so agree to comply with library policies and guidelines which prohibit the viewing of pornographic materials. = Virginia House of Delegates = Black was first elected to the Virginia House in a special election in 1998 to succeed Republican Delegate Bill Mims, who had been elected to the Virginia Senate. Black resigned from the Library Board a few months after being sworn-in. A \\"deeply conservative\\" delegate, Black became well known for making controversial statements. In 2001, Black sponsored a bill to require internet filters on the computers in public schools. The bill passed overwhelmingly in both the House and Senate and was signed into law in March, 2001. During the 2001 Legislative session, Black dealt with a number of abortion related bills. In February 2001, he co- sponsored a bill to establish a 24-hour \\"informed consent\\" waiting period for women seeking an abortion. The bill required a clinic or hospital to tell a woman seeking an abortion the approximate age of the fetus, details of the abortion procedure and other options available to her. The bill eventually passed and was signed into law. Also during the 2001 session, Black opposed a bill that would allow the \\"morning-after pill\\" to be dispensed at pharmacies. Opponents of the bill said that, unlike normal contraceptives that prevent the fertilization of an egg, these types of emergency contraceptives can act as an abortifacient, preventing a fertilized egg from attaching to the uterine wall. \\"This is a baby pesticide we're looking at. It's a toxic method of eliminating a child,\\" said Black. Although the bill failed to become law, the morning- after pill can be purchased in Virginia from pharmacies without a prescription by people ages 17 or older and with a prescription for those 16 and younger, and one brand is available over-the-counter for people of all ages without ID. Route 28 Corridor Improvements During the 2002 Session, Black successfully passed HB 735 – Transportation Improvement Districts. The bill was designed to allow property along the Route 28 corridor to be included in multiple special tax districts. This was necessary because some of the property was already in an existing special tax district and the landowners along Route 28 were looking to create a new transportation improvement district to change this major corridor into a high speed freeway. In late 2002 and early 2003, Black opposed erecting a statue of Abraham Lincoln and his son Thomas at the Tredegar Iron Works to commemorate Lincoln's visit to Richmond on April 4, 1865, 10 days before his assassination. Black said, \\"Putting a statue to [Lincoln] there is sort of like putting the Confederate flag at the Lincoln Memorial.\\" In July 2003, Black proposed legislation that would prevent unmarried and gay couples from applying for low-interest home mortgages, saying that the state was \\"spending $90 million to subsidize sodomy and adultery. I just don't understand why we are taking money away [from worthwhile programs] and supporting a radical homosexual agenda.\\" Also in 2003, delivered plastic fetus dolls to fellow delegates and senators. Black used the dolls to generate publicity for his bill requiring Parental consent for a minor to get an abortion. Black's bill, HB 1402, passed and was signed into law. In February 2005, he urged his constituents to picket Stone Bridge High School for putting on a play about a gay football player, claiming that the school was \\"being used to promote a homosexual lifestyle.\\" He further claimed that attempts to \\"encourage homosexual activity, to portray it in a cute or favorable light\\" could lead to children contracting HIV. In 2004, he said with regard to Virginia's sodomy law: \\"If I'm the last person on the face of this Earth to vote against legalizing sodomy, I'll do it.\\" Ollin Crawford During his time in the Virginia House of Delegates, Black was also involved with advocating for clemency on behalf of Ollin Crawford. Crawford, known as the \\"grenade lady,\\" was serving a 70-year sentence after she committed a series of robberies where she claimed to have a grenade stuffed into a sock. No one was injured in any of the four robberies. Because the Dept. of Corrections classified Crawford as a \\"three-time loser,\\" she was ineligible for parole. Black's interest in the case came from what he felt was a discrepancy in the way Crawford was treated and a similar case where Sue Kennon, a suburban housewife, committed four armed robberies with a toy pistol. Kennon was granted parole in 2001 after serving 14 years of a 48-year sentence. In pointing out the similarities of the case, but the difference in outcome, Black said. “I don't believe there was deliberate discrimination, but reasonable people might ask why a poor black woman hasn't received the same consideration as an affluent white woman. We do know that two women with very similar cases received vastly different treatment.” Black advocated on Crawford's behalf for 10 years, starting in 1997. He requested clemency for Crawford from three different Virginia Governors, including George Allen (American politician) and Mark Warner. Finally, Tim Kaine granted clemency and Crawford was released in early 2008. Black was defeated in his quest for a fifth term by Democrat David Poisson in 2005. Poisson defeated him 53%–47%. Black ran for the Republican nomination in the special election for Virginia's 1st congressional district in October 2007. A convention was held to determine the nominee and Black came fifth eliminated in the fourth ballot. State Delegate Rob Wittman was picked and went on to win the election. =Virginia Senate= Black ran for the State Senate in 2011 in the newly-created 13th district, which encompasses nearly half of Loudoun County and a portion of Prince William County. His former home had been in another portion of Loudoun County represented in the State Senate by Democrat Mark Herring. Black won a hard-fought three-way primary, taking 3,143 votes (38.83%) to John Stirrup's 3,029 votes (37.42%) and Robert S. Fitzsimmonds' 1,923 votes (23.76%). In the general election, Black handily defeated Democrat Shawn Mitchell by 57% to 43%. In an interview in December 2013, Black compared same-sex marriage to polygamy and incest, saying that although he opposed polygamy, \\"at least it functions biologically\\", adding that it was \\"just more natural\\" than homosexuality. In 2014, Black briefly ran for Virginia's 10th congressional district in the 2014 elections to succeed retiring Republican incumbent Frank Wolf. He withdrew on January 23, two days after declaring his candidacy, saying: \\"after meeting with Republican Caucus leaders in Richmond, it is imperative that I remain in the Senate where I am needed to maintain our 20/20 split.\\" Although the Virginia Senate was split 20/20, Democrats held the majority as Ralph Northam, the Democratic Lieutenant Governor of Virginia, cast tie-breaking votes. In January 2019, Black announced he would not seek reelection for his State Senate seat in the 2019 Virginia legislative elections and instead retire at the end of his term. Syria In April 2014, Black sent an official letter to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, thanking \\"the Syrian Arab Army for its heroic rescue of Christians in the Qalamoun Mountain Range\\", praising Assad for \\"treating with respect all Christians and the small community of Jews in Damascus,\\" and stating it was obvious that the rebel side of the war was largely being fought by \\"vicious war criminals linked to Al Qaeda\\" Democratic State Senator A. Donald McEachin called the letter \\"bizarre,\\" while Republican State Senator Bill Stanley later joked \\"What's the matter, Dick? Was Kim Jong-un not returning your text messages?\\". In 2015 Islamic State included Black in a list of its enemies, calling him \\"The American Crusader.\\" It quoted the following statement by Black: \\"One thing is clear, if Damascus falls, the dreaded black and white flag of ISIS will fly over Damascus. ... Within a period of months after the fall of Damascus, Jordan will fall and Lebanon will fall. ... I think you will automatically see a beginning of a historic push of Islam towards Europe and I think, ultimately, Europe will be conquered.\\" On April 27, 2016, Black began a three-day trip to Syria in support of its government. Explaining his trip in a series of Twitter exchanges with The Washington Post, Black wrote that the United States was \\"allied with two of the most vile nations on earth, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, which are intent on imposing a [Wahhabi] fundamentalist government on the Syrian people.\\" In 2018, Black appeared on an Arab TV channel where he claimed that the British intelligence service, MI6, was planning a false flag chemical attack on Syria, which it would then try to blame on the Assad regime. Medicaid expansion Black introduced a budget amendment to the General Assembly to prohibit Medicaid expansion without the legislature's approval. He led a conservative revolt against Medicaid expansion that inspired the Twitter hashtag #BlackorBust. After a full day of heated back-door debates, Black prevailed and the Senate approved a budget without Medicaid expansion, which was Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe's signature issue. McAuliffe vowed not to sign a budget without it. On June 20, 2014, McAuliffe announced he would veto the Black or Bust amendment. But his attempted veto of the Black or Bust Medicaid Amendment failed when his veto was ruled unlawful by the Speaker. =Russia Today appearances= Black has made frequent appearances on RT (formerly known as Russia Today), commenting on United States foreign affairs policy. RT has come under frequent fire for allegedly acting as a propaganda arm of the Kremlin, which provides the channel's funding, and for its perceived anti-American bias during newscasts. In its filing with the US Justice Department, RT America stated it wasn't sure how much of its budget came from the Russian government. November 14, 2017 appearance When asked for his reaction to RT America having to register as a foreign agent, Black said: References External links * Senator Black.com Official site * Senator Dick Black (R-Leesburg) at Richmond Sunlight * 1944 births Living people 20th- century American politicians 21st-century American politicians United States Marine Corps personnel of the Vietnam War Members of the Virginia House of Delegates People from Ashburn, Virginia Politicians from Baltimore United States Army colonels United States Army War College alumni United States Marine Corps officers University of Florida alumni Virginia Republicans Virginia state senators ","title":"Dick Black (politician)"},{"id":"36534762","text":"Virginia Park is a rugby ground, cricket ground and former greyhound racing stadium in Caerphilly, South Wales. It is currently the home ground for Caerphilly RFC. Location and Origins The rugby ground is accessed from Virginia Close and the cricket ground is accessed from Melville Terrace. Both roads are off the Pontygwindy Road. The name Virginia Park came from the state of Virginia in the United States because during the American Revolution the loyalist John Goodrich and his family fled to Caerphilly and settled on the Energlyn Estate that they had purchased. The main house was called Virginia House and it remained so for the next one hundred years. Rugby Union On 26 August 1887 a committee sitting at the Castle Hotel formed Caerphilly RFC. The ground has remained their home with the exception of a period when they disbanded. Originally known as the Virginia Park Athletic Grounds it was little more than a very large field in 1887. After World War II the greyhound stadium closed and was eventually demolished and the rugby club returned to play fixtures at Virginia Park afterwards and in the late fifties they finally called Virginia Park their home with the pitch being relocated to the northern section of the park. The Stadium was known as the Constructaquote Stadium for the 2017-2018 season but for the 2018-2019 season known as the Vetro Recruitment Stadium. Greyhound racing The greyhound stadium was located in the central area of Virginia Park. A grandstand was constructed in 1931 by the greyhound company and the opening night was on 25 May 1931. The stadium raced under the National Greyhound Racing Club (NGRC) rules of racing. Many other events took place there and included boxing, speedway, trotting and Powderhall foot racing in addition to being used as a venue for politicians. The stadium stopped racing under NGRC rules in 1935. The demise of greyhound racing at Virginia Park came during World War II. It was used as a storage depot for the fire brigade and a recreation area for American soldiers during the war.

It is one of several country houses owned by the members of the Pejačević noble family in the region of Slavonia. History According to the sign located on the facade above the entrance, the manor was built by count Sigismund Pejačević in 1801, with the actual construction beginning somewhere around 1796. The Retfala estate was acquired by the Pejačević Counts as a grant by the then Austrian empress and Croatian-Hungarian Queen Maria Theresa in 1750. In the beginning it started out as a relatively small estate. Architecture The refined classical manor is composed of three wings shaped in the form of the letter U. The internal space is organised around a central hallway with rooms aligned on either side. The central axis is highlighted by the grand hall and atrium within the great pavilion. The central pavilion is raised on the first floor, whilst the remaining part of the manor, complete with its lateral wings, is at ground level. At ground level, the pavilion is articulated by arcades and a great series of ionic pilasters, which was originally covered by a mansard roof, as was the remainder of the building. The manor is separated from the street by a triumphal entrance made from wrought iron railings. Despite the identity of the architect not being known, the manor is regarded as a significant work of classical architecture within Croatia. Mausoleum The Pejačević Family chapel-mausoleum which dates from the year 1891, is located at the Retfala Cemetery in the vicinity of the manor. Today Previously set amongst a large pleasure garden, the manor is now in a neglected and decrepit state. Once a part of the pleasure garden which stretched all around the manor, the mausoleum set within the contemporary Retfala Cemetery shares the same fate.

Martello tower The Martello tower was constructed on the site of an existing battery in 1804 after the onset of the Napoleonic Wars and during the tenure (1803-1813) of Lieutenant Governor General Sir John Doyle. Doyle named the tower for the Guernsey native and renowned Royal Navy Captain, Sir James Saumarez, who at the time commanded British naval forces in the Channel Islands. To simplify matters, Doyle had a local builder named Gray construct the tower, and two others, see below, under the rubric of \\"fieldworks\\", thereby bypassing the Ordnance Corps. The Fort Saumarez tower, like the other two Guernsey Martello towers, Fort Grey and Fort Hommet, was intended as a keep for the battery in which it was placed. The Guernsey Martellos are smaller than the British towers, with the Fort Saumarez and Fort Hommet towers being smaller than the Fort Grey tower. Each mounted a 24-pounder carronade on the roof to protect the battery. Fort Saumarez and Fort Hommet also have exterior staircases up to the second floor.Clements (1998), p. 87. Doyle was responsible for substantial fortification efforts elsewhere in Guernsey, including the construction of the two other Martello towers. Because of its location, Fort Saumarez also served as one of six to ten optical telegraph stations that ringed the coast to give warning of approaching vessels. In 1852, the battery at Fort Saumarez received 32-pounder guns and 8\\" shell guns in place of some of its 24-pounder guns. Stützpunkt Langenberg During World War II and the German occupation of the Channel Islands, the Germans recognized the enduring utility of the site and built a four-storey concrete observation tower on top of the existing tower. At some point the battery around the Fort Saumarez tower was demolished. Fort Saumarez is now privately owned and not publicly accessible. On the headland the Germans constructed facing north a casemate for a 4.7cm Pak 36 (t) anti tank gun and one for a 10.5cm K 331(f). A 60cm searchlight was located next to the trench system that includes a Tobruk (Ringstände) position holding a 3.7cm Pak 36 in a tank turret. A M19 automatic mortar bunker, a 5 cm Pak 38, personnel bunker, a casemate for a 4.7 Pak 36 (t) anti tank gun and one for a 10.5cm K 331(f) face south, with another 60cm searchlight.

Neuwirth came to international attention after winning the Eurovision Song Contest 2014 as Austria's entrant with the song \\"Rise Like a Phoenix\\". He uses masculine pronouns when referring to himself but feminine pronouns to describe Conchita. Born in Gmunden, Austria, Neuwirth moved to Graz to do his matura exam with a focus on fashion, before embarking on a singing career through the 2007 casting show Starmania. He subsequently became a founding member of the short-lived boy band Jetzt Anders!. In 2011, Neuwirth began appearing as Conchita – a female character noted for her beard – and came second in the Austrian pre-selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2012. Conchita was selected to represent Austria at the Eurovision Song Contest 2014, where her performance received the most points and resulted in her winning the contest. It brought her international attention and established her as a gay icon, resulting in invitations to perform at various pride parades, the European Parliament and the United Nations Office in Vienna. Early life =1988–2005: Youth= Thomas Neuwirth was born on 6 November 1988 in Gmunden, Austria, but raised in the small town of Bad Mitterndorf, in the Styrian countryside in Austria. He has stated that the mountainous area was a wonderful place to grow up, but that he faced prejudice for being homosexual: \\"Being a teenager, a gay teenager, in such a small village is not that much fun. I am part of the gay community and most gays have a similar story to mine.\\" From an early age he recognised that he was different from other children, initially believing that this was because there was \\"something wrong\\" with him. He occasionally wore a skirt to kindergarten and then school, although subsequently felt that he could only be happy doing so in the attic of his home. Aged 14, Neuwirth moved to Graz to attend school, with a focus on fashion. His fashion icon was Victoria Beckham. =2006–2013: Early musical career= Neuwirth performing in 2007 In 2006, Neuwirth took part in the third edition of the Austrian TV show Starmania, finishing in second place (Nadine Beiler placed first). One year later, Neuwirth founded the boyband Jetzt Anders!, but the group disbanded during the same year. It was after this that Neuwirth developed the drag persona of Conchita Wurst, a bearded woman. In the German language, \\"Wurst\\" means \\"sausage\\", although Neuwirth relates the choice of last name to the common German expression \\"Das ist mir doch alles Wurst\\", which translates as \\"it's all the same to me\\", and \\"I don't care\\", stating that the name emerged from the first meaning of that expression.\\"Conchita Wurst: 'Der Song Contest ist absolut unberechenbar'\\", interview in Der Standard, 24 April 2014 The name \\"Conchita\\" meanwhile had been adopted from a Cuban friend of his. In an interview he also explained that conchita is Spanish slang for vagina and Wurst is German slang for penis. Neuwirth asserted that the inclusion of the beard as part of the Conchita character was \\"a statement to say that you can achieve anything, no matter who you are or how you look.\\" The inclusion of a beard as part of the drag look was not unique, having been pioneered in the 1970s by The Cockettes in San Francisco and the Bloolips in London. Conchita's first appearance was on ORF's show Die große Chance in 2011, where she achieved 6th place. In 2012, she competed in the Austrian National Final for the Eurovision Song Contest 2012 and came second.Trackshittaz vertreten Österreich beim Song Contest , 25 February 2012. Retrieved 26 June 2014. (German) Conchita then appeared in the ORF show The Hardest Jobs of Austria, working in a fish processing plant, and in Wild Girls, in which a group of candidates had to survive in the deserts of Namibia together with native tribes. Participation in the Eurovision Song Contest 2014 =Selection= Conchita in March 2014 On 10 September 2013, Austrian national broadcaster ORF announced that it had selected Conchita to represent Austria at the Eurovision Song Contest 2014, to be held in Copenhagen, Denmark, in May 2014. In March 2014, Conchita's song was revealed as \\"Rise Like a Phoenix\\", with bookmakers placing her entry as one of the ten favourites to win. Despite Eurovision's reputation for campness, Conchita's performance was designed to be serious and in good taste, and she was one of just a few performers to appear onstage alone. Although individuals who identified as LGBT had appeared on Eurovision before – most notably Israel's Dana International, who won in 1998 – Conchita's appearance was described by the New Statesman as the \\"most genderqueer yet\\". Conchita's selection proved controversial and attracted criticism from conservative groups, particularly in Eastern Europe, thus highlighting the continent's regional divide between east and west on the issue of homosexuality. In Austria, four days after ORF announced its decision, more than 31,000 people had clicked to 'like' an \\"Anti-Wurst\\" page on social networking service Facebook. Petitions emerged in Russia and Belarus calling for their respective national broadcasters to edit out Conchita's performance from the televised contest; the Russian petition asserted that Eurovision had become \\"a hotbed of sodomy, at the initiation of European liberals\\". Conservative Russian politician Vitaly Milonov urged Russia's Eurovision selection committee to boycott the competition as a result of Conchita's inclusion, describing her performance as \\"blatant propaganda of homosexuality and spiritual decay\\" and referring to her as the \\"pervert from Austria\\". Armenia's entry for the contest, Aram Mp3, stated that Neuwirth's lifestyle was \\"not natural\\" and that he should decide whether he was a man or woman. Neuwirth hit back: \\"I told him I don't want to be a woman. I am just a working queen and a very lazy boy at home.\\" Aram subsequently apologised, stating that his prior comments had been intended as a joke. Reacting to these sentiments, the New Statesman commented that \\"a vote for Wurst is another vote against Russian homophobia and transphobia, and a win would send out a strong message of defiance eastwards\\", while the International Business Times called on readers to vote for Conchita to upset homophobes. Highlighting statements such as these as evidence, Spiked declared that many Western European commentators and politicos had adopted Conchita as \\"a symbol of everything that makes Western Europe superior to the East\\" and that she had thus become part of a culture war against both Russia and \\"the so-called bigots and backward types\\" in their own nations. =Victory= Conchita holding the Eurovision trophy after winning the contest At the second semi-final on 8 May, Neuwirth, as Conchita, qualified for the final on 10 May. At the finals held in Copenhagen on 10 May 2014, she won the competition with 290 points. This was Austria's first Eurovision win since Eurovision 1966. Points allocated to Austria in the ESC 2014 Conchita's entry gained high scores from Western European countries as well as some in the East, such as Georgia and Ukraine. However, the levels of support for Conchita varied across Europe: on average she received 4.4 points out of 12 from the post-Soviet states (excluding the Baltic states), 6 points from the other ex-socialist states, and 10.5 points from Western Europe, Scandinavia, Greece, and Israel. Commenting on this, political analyst Alan Renwick of the British University of Reading asserted that \\"Even in those countries where the ruling elites are often highly intolerant, the wider population might be readier to accept that different people might be different.\\" Upon being awarded the trophy, Conchita held it aloft and proclaimed \\"We are unity and we are unstoppable\\". She later confirmed to reporters that this was a message meant for politicians who opposed LGBT rights, including President of Russia Vladimir Putin, whose administration had implemented a law restricting LGBT rights in June 2013. =International response= On returning to Austria, Conchita was greeted at the airport by a crowd of over 1000 cheering fans, many wearing fake beards and singing \\"Rise Like a Phoenix\\". To journalists, she expanded on the message of tolerance which she had championed at Eurovision: \\"It was not just a victory for me but a victory for those people who believe in a future that can function without discrimination and is based on tolerance and respect.\\" President of Austria Heinz Fischer asserted that it was \\"not just a victory for Austria, but above all for diversity and tolerance in Europe\\". A local radio station celebrated by playing \\"Rise Like a Phoenix\\" on a loop 48 times over four hours. The UK's Eurovision commentator Graham Norton commented on the socio-political significance of Conchita's victory: \\"it seems like Eurovision has done something that matters just a little bit\\". Greek singers and former Eurovision entrants Helena Paparizou and Anna Vissi expressed their liking of the song and Conchita's appearance. Vissi also compared the latter to Italian singer Mina's similar appearance as a bearded woman on the cover of a 1981 album of hers, to critically highlight that \\"[it is] 2014 and we still cannot accept statements of diversity.\\" Conchita performing at London's gay superclub Heaven in May 2014 Following her victory, Conchita became an icon for Europe's LGBT community. Vienna's tourist board hoped to use Conchita to encourage more gay holidaymakers to visit the city, using her image on the Facebook page \\"Gayfriendly Vienna\\". The Week stated that she had become \\"a serious figure of hope\\" for some LGBT people living \\"under the shadow of officially-sanctioned intolerance\\" in various European countries, while British trans activist Paris Lees commented that across Europe she inspired \\"millions of people\\" and stood up for \\"everyone who has ever been made to feel ashamed or afraid for being different.\\" LGBT rights groups in Serbia and Croatia criticised the tone with which their national broadcasters referred to Conchita, deeming it offensive and homophobic; Serbia's RTS subsequently issued a letter of apology. In Russia, \\"Rise Like a Phoenix\\" topped the internet download chart two days after the competition. Fans of Conchita and LGBT rights activists applied to hold a Conchita Wurst March of Bearded Women and Men through Moscow, Russia, on 27 May, a date commemorating the 21st anniversary since the legalisation of same-sex sexual activity in the country. Officials from the city's security department rejected the request, citing a wish to \\"respect morality in the education of the younger generation\\" and to prevent violent clashes between marchers and anti-gay demonstrators. Russian singer Filipp Kirkorov, who helped write the Eurovision song \\"Shine\\", called on Russians to respect Conchita's victory, saying: \\"it was the song that won, and in my opinion it was a beautiful song.\\" Criticism continued to be made following Conchita's victory. Volkan Bozkır, then chairman of Turkey's foreign affairs committee, remarked \\"thank God we no longer participate in Eurovision\\". The leader of Poland's opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party, Jarosław Kaczyński, said that \\"Very disquieting things are going on in Europe, things that show decadence, downturn and we would like to reverse this trend.\\" The spokesperson of the Law and Justice (PiS) party stated that \\"Conchita Wurst is (...) a symbol of Europe I don’t want. My Europe is based on Christian values.\\" Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin posted on social networking service Twitter that the result \\"showed supporters of European integration their European future: a bearded girl.\\" Russia's opposition politician, the ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, proclaimed \\"There's no limit to our outrage. It's the end of Europe\\", later adding that \\"Fifty years ago the Soviet army occupied Austria. We made a mistake in freeing Austria. We should have stayed.\\" Deputy leader of Russia's opposition Communist Party, Valery Rashkin, announced that \\"The last Eurovision results exhausted our patience... We cannot tolerate this endless madness\\", calling for the foundation of an alternative, The Voice of Eurasia, in which Russia and its neighbouring allies could compete. The Russian Orthodox Church condemned Conchita's victory, with Vladimir Legoyda, chairman of the church's information department, describing it as \\"yet one more step in the rejection of the Christian identity of European culture\\", reflecting an attempt to \\"reinforce new cultural norms\\". A social media campaign involved Russian men shaving off their beards in protest at Conchita's victory; those taking part included broadcaster Andrey Malakhov and rapper Aleksander \\"ST\\" Stepanov. Patriarch Irinej of Serbia asserted that the May 2014 flooding (mainly in Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina) was \\"divine punishment\\" from God for Conchita's victory. Metropolitan Amfilohije of Montenegro also blamed Conchita's victory for the floods. Irish television presenter for the BBC and former Eurovision BBC commentator Terry Wogan described that year's performance as a \\"freak show\\". Reacting to these critics, Conchita stated \\"It's so ridiculous! For me a perfect world would be when we don't have to talk about sexuality, where you're from, what you believe. Is this the worst thing in the mind of the politicians?\\" She stated her desire to perform in Russia for the country's LGBT community, \\"To tell them that they are not alone. The whole community around the world is standing behind them. They have to trust that if they open their mouth, then we can change something.\\" To a reporter from The Observer, she commented: \\"It's funny that these people think I'm so powerful. I've figured out over the years, you can only hurt me if I love you; if I don't know you, I really don't care. There are people who want to kill me and I'm always like, 'Well, get in line, darling.'\\" 2014–present: Subsequent career Conchita performing at Eurovision Song Contest 2014 On 28 June 2014, Conchita performed onstage at Trafalgar Square in central London as the headline act during the city's annual LGBT Pride Parade. She was introduced onstage by actor and LGBT rights campaigner Ian McKellen, and performed to a crowd of over 300,000 alongside acts Samantha Fox and Sinitta. She informed reporters from The Observer that \\"I don't want to say the other Prides are less good, but I fell in love with London immediately, so today is a very special day for me. All the drag queens looked stunning.\\" On 2 July, she opened Madrid's LGBT Pride festival with a concert at Chueca Plaza, there performing alongside Ruth Lorenzo, before performing at Stockholm Pride on 30 July, at Antwerp Pride on 10 August, and at Manchester Pride on 24 August. On 9 July, she made her modelling debut on the catwalk at fashion designer Jean Paul Gaultier's Couture show in Paris, where she took the final spot, which is usually reserved for Gaultier's favourite model. In August she modeled Givenchy clothing for Karl Lagerfeld's fashion editorial, \\"The New Normal\\", published in Carine Roitfeld's CR Fashion Book. She was invited to attend the 2015 Golden Globe Awards in Los Angeles as part of the Austrian delegation supporting nominee Christoph Waltz. Conchita at a Meet & Greet in Copenhagen On 8 October, Conchita performed to a crowd of 2000 delegates and their staff at an anti-discrimination event held at the European Parliament in Brussels; her speech emphasised the values of tolerance, stating that \\"As I always say, you don't have to love me, but you have to respect that I'm here.\\" Her appearance had been organised by the Austrian Member of the European Parliament (MEP) Ulrike Lunacek, a member of the Green Party, and while it had the backing of most of the European Parliament groups, it was not supported by the right-wing Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy and European Conservatives and Reformists groups. On 3 November, she performed at the United Nations Office at Vienna in front of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon. A spokesperson for Ban described Conchita as a \\"cultural icon\\" and asserted that \\"Everyone is entitled to enjoy the same basic rights and live a life of worth and dignity without discrimination. This fundamental principle is embedded in the UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Conchita is a symbol in that sense and I think it's good for them to meet. [The meeting allows us] to reassert his support for LGBT people and for them to ensure that they enjoy the same human rights and protection that we all do.\\" Conchita proceeded to state that she would like to spend a week with Russian President Putin in order to better understand him and his government's stance on LGBT rights.; Conchita proceeded to begin work on an album influenced by \\"mature ladies\\" like Cher, Shirley Bassey, and Tina Turner. Her first post-Eurovision single, \\"Heroes\\", was released on 8 November 2014. Conchita performed the song for the first time on Wetten, dass..?. On 19 December 2014, it was revealed that Conchita would host the green room at the Eurovision Song Contest 2015 in Vienna. On 7 May 2015, Conchita published her autobiography with John Blake Publishing. Conchita's debut album Conchita was released on 15 May 2015. It was preceded by her second single after winning the Eurovision Song Contest, \\"You Are Unstoppable\\", which was released on 5 March 2015. \\"Firestorm\\" and \\"Colours of Your Love\\", two tracks from the debut album, were released as a double A-side single on 7 August 2015. Conchita in 2019 On 3 March 2016, Conchita performed at the Sydney Opera House accompanied by the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and together with Australian stars like Courtney Act and ESC 2015 participant Guy Sebastian as a part of Sydney Mardi Gras festival. Conchita performed for BBC Radio 2's Friday Night Is Music Night on 25 February 2018 at the London Palladium. In April 2018, Conchita praised Israel's Netta Barzilai and her song \\"Toy\\" as her favourite song for Eurovision 2018, saying \\"If she wins I will love it.\\" In August 2018, Turkey's public broadcaster, the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT), stated it will not take part in the Eurovision while \\"someone like the bearded Austrian who wore a skirt\\" could win the competition. In 2019, Neuwirth revealed that he would be splitting the characters, Conchita would continue with the more feminine style of performance and a new mononymous persona called WURST would allow for a more masculine expression, Neuwirth also announced that he would be releasing new music as WURST. The single \\"Trash All the Glam\\" was released 8 March 2019 through Sony Music Austria.http://conchitawurst.com/pr-190308/ The second single shortly followed, entitled \\"Hit Me\\", which was said to be a hit back to a former boyfriend of Neuwirth's who he was receiving threats from about how he would publicly reveal his HIV-positive status. A third single, \\"See Me Now\\" was released on 5 April 2019. The album was announced under the name Truth Over Magnitude,http://conchitawurst.com/news-wurst-performs-hit-me-live-at-amadeus- austrian-music-awards-for-the-first-time-on-tv/ and was produced by Albin Janoska.http://conchitawurst.com/pr-190315-en/ In 2019, Conchita became a permanent judge on the drag competition reality series Queen of Drags alongside Heidi Klum and Bill Kaulitz. In 2020, Neuwirth appeared in his Conchita character in a small role in the Netflix film Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga starring Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams. Personal life Neuwirth has stated that he is not a trans woman, but is a cis man. He is gay, and has also described himself as a drag queen. He uses she/her pronouns to describe his Conchita Wurst character, but he/him pronouns when referring to himself. Neuwirth created a fictional back story for the Conchita character, claiming that she was born in the mountains of Colombia and is married to the French burlesque dancer Jacques Patriaque, a real individual who is a friend of Neuwirth's.oe24: Jacques Patriaque im Interview: Conchitas Ehemann packt aus!, 16 May 2014 He compared the use of the character to American singer Beyoncé's adoption of the Sasha Fierce alter ego, or singer Lady Gaga's use of various costumes, being a way to protect Neuwirth's own private life. In 2018, Neuwirth disclosed that he is HIV-positive and has been undetectable (and thus not infectious) for several years. He wrote through an Instagram post that he felt compelled to come out as HIV-positive due to persistent threats from a former boyfriend that he would publicly reveal Neuwirth's status.

Inspired by the biblical story of Noah's Ark from the Book of Genesis, the film stars Russell Crowe as Noah, along with Jennifer Connelly, Emma Watson, Ray Winstone, Logan Lerman, Douglas Booth, and Anthony Hopkins. The film was released in North American theaters on March 28, 2014, in 2D and IMAX, while a version converted to 3D and IMAX 3D was released in several other countries. Noah received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed over $362 million worldwide, making it Aronofsky's highest-grossing film to date. It was praised for its direction and acting, but generated controversy, primarily due to its lack of racial diversity, its perceived environmentalist political messages and its extensive use of non-biblical sources for inspiration such as the Book of Enoch. It was banned in China for \\"religion-related reasons\\". It was also banned in several Muslim countries because it was seen as contradicting the teachings of Islam. Plot As a young boy, Noah witnesses his father, Lamech, killed by a young Tubal-cain. Years later, an adult Noah lives with his wife Naameh and their sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth. After seeing a flower grow instantly from the ground and being haunted by dreams of a great flood, Noah takes them to visit his grandfather Methuselah. They encounter a group of people recently killed and adopt the lone survivor, a girl named Ila. Ila is treated for an abdominal wound and will survive, but Naameh determines that she will be unable to have children. Noah and his family are chased by the murderers and seek refuge with the fallen angels known as the \\"Watchers\\", in whose territory Methuselah lives. The Watchers are confined on Earth as creatures of stone for helping humans banished from the Garden of Eden. Methuselah gives Noah a seed from Eden and tells Noah that he was chosen for a reason. Returning to his tent that night, Noah plants the seed in the ground. The Watchers arrive the next morning and debate whether they should help Noah until they see water spout from the spot where Noah planted the seed. After a forest grows instantly, the Watchers agree to help Noah and his family build an ark. After birds fly to the ark, Tubal-cain arrives with his followers and confronts Noah. Noah defies Tubal-cain and remarks that there is no escape for the line of Cain. Tubal- cain retreats and decides to build weapons to defeat the Watchers and take the ark. As the ark nears completion, animals of various species enter the ark and are sedated with incense. With Ila having become enamored of Shem, Noah goes to a nearby settlement to find wives for Ham and Japheth but, seeing the settlers selling their daughters for food, he abandons his effort and begins believing that the Creator wants all of humanity dead. He tells his family that he will not seek wives for his younger sons. After the flood, they will be the last humans and there will be no new human generations. Devastated that he will be alone his entire life, Ham runs into the forest. Naameh begs Noah to reconsider but, when he will not, she goes to Methuselah for help. Ila encounters Methuselah who cures her infertility. Ham, searching for a wife on his own, befriends the refugee Na'el. After it starts raining, Tubal-cain becomes angry that he was not chosen to be saved and incites his followers to make a run for the ark. Noah finds Ham in the forest and forces Ham to save himself, but leaves Na'el to die when she is caught in an animal trap. Noah's family enter the ark except for Methuselah, who remains in the forest and is swept away by the rushing waters. The Watchers fight off Tubal-cain and his mob of followers, sacrificing themselves and ascending to heaven, their reward for protecting Noah. As the flood drowns the remaining humans, an injured Tubal-cain climbs onto the ark and solicits Ham, playing on anger toward Noah for allowing Na'el to die. Ila discovers she is pregnant as the rains stop and begs the Creator to let the child live. Noah interprets the ending of the rain to mean he must ensure the extinction of humans and, against his wife's protests, resolves that, if the child is a girl, he will kill her. Nine months later, Ila and Shem build a raft to escape Noah's resolve, but Noah discovers and burns it. Ila then starts feeling labor pains and gives birth to twin girls. After Ham calls Noah telling him the beasts are awake and eating each other, Tubal-cain emerges and attempts to hit Noah. Noah and Tubal-cain engage in combat. Shem promises Ila that Noah will not harm their daughters and goes to stop him. He attacks Noah as Tubal-cain falls to the ground only to be knocked out. Tubal-cain eventually forces Noah to the edge of the raft, but Ham kills him with a dagger before he can shove Noah in the ocean. Noah picks himself up and finds Ila and the babies, intending to kill the children, but spares them upon looking at his granddaughters and only feeling love. Upon exiting the ark on the new land, a shameful Noah goes into isolation in a nearby cave, making wine in which to drown his sorrows. Ham expresses disappointment for his father's current state of unseemly drunkenness and nakedness before leaving his kin to live alone. Having reconciled at the behest of Ila, Noah blesses the family as the beginning of a new human race and all witness waves of immense celestial rainbows.

As part of a creative writing assignment, he submitted a poem about Noah entitled \\"The Dove\\". Years later, after finishing the film Pi, Aronofsky was searching for ideas for his next film and thought that a film about Noah would be a good idea. Work on the script began in 2000 but Aronofsky put the project on hold when he learned Hallmark was already working on a similar film. Work on the draft resumed sometime later, and a first draft was completed in 2003. In adapting the story for a feature film Aronofsky struggled with how to adapt it to feature length—the story in the Bible is only four chapters and does not include names for his wife or his sons' wives. The text does mention Noah getting drunk after the flood and getting into an altercation with one of his sons, which provided Aronofsky and his team with ideas into what events could have taken place on the ark. Aronofsky first discussed Noah with The Guardian in April 2007, explaining that he saw Noah as \\"a dark, complicated character\\" who experiences \\"real survivor's guilt\\" after the flood. Aronofsky was working on early drafts of the script for Noah around the time his first attempt to make The Fountain fell through when actor Brad Pitt left the project. Ari Handel—Aronofsky's collaborator on The Fountain, The Wrestler, and Black Swan—helped Aronofsky develop the script. Before they found financial backing for Noah, they collaborated with Canadian artist Niko Henrichon to adapt the script into a graphic novel. The first volume of the graphic novel was released in the French language by Belgian publisher Le Lombard in October 2011 under the title Noé: Pour la cruauté des hommes (Noah: For the Cruelty of Men). After the creation of the graphic novel, Aronofsky struck a deal with Paramount and New Regency to produce a feature film of Noah with a budget of $130 million. Screenwriter John Logan was asked to re-draft the script alongside Aronofsky but is not credited for his contributions. In October 2012, Emma Watson commented on the setting of the film: \\"I think what Darren's going for is a sense that it could be set in any time. It could be set sort of like a thousand years in the future or a thousand years in the past. ... You shouldn't be able to place it too much.\\" =Casting= Aronofsky had previously offered the role of Noah to Christian Bale and Michael Fassbender, both of whom were unable to take the part due to previous commitments. Bale went on to star as Moses in Ridley Scott's religious epic film Exodus: Gods and Kings. Dakota Fanning was originally cast in the role of Ila, but departed due to a scheduling conflict. Julianne Moore was also considered for the role of Naameh. Liam Neeson, Liev Schreiber, and Val Kilmer were also considered for the part of Tubal-cain. Aronofsky reportedly wanted an actor \\"with the grit and size to be convincing as he goes head-to-head against Crowe's Noah character\\". =Filming= Principal photography began in July 2012 in Dyrhólaey, Fossvogur, Reynisfjara, and other locations in southern Iceland. Filming also took place in New York state. A set representing Noah's Ark was built at the Planting Fields Arboretum in Upper Brookville, New York. In September 2012, while on break from a location on Long Island, Russell Crowe and a friend, both of whom had been kayaking for several hours, were rescued by the Coast Guard near Cold Spring Harbor. Production was put on hold while Hurricane Sandy subjected New York to heavy rain and flooding during late October 2012. =Post-production= Post-production lasted over 14 months, with Aronofsky attempting some of the most complicated and extensive effects ever used in film. Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) said their work on the film represented \\"the most complicated rendering in the company's history.\\"Anderson, John. (Fall 2013). The Many Worlds of Darren Aronofsky. Director's Guild of America. Retrieved October 16, 2013 from http://www.dga.org/Craft/DGAQ/All-Articles/1304-Fall-2013/Darren- Aronofsky.aspx To make the fallen angels' movements realistic, VFX supervisor Ben Snow and Aronofsky studied footage of real ballet dancers from the director's Oscar-winning drama Black Swan. Snow and ILM also teamed for the film's water scenes. \\"We created this great effect of geysers from the ground shooting water that meets rain falling to Earth,\\" said Snow. \\"That's the thrill: to create something you've never done, or something people have never seen.\\" Regarding the film's extensive use of visual effects, Aronofsky said he and his crew \\"had to create an entire animal kingdom\\" using no real animals in the production but instead \\"slightly tweaked\\" versions of real creatures.Masters, Kim. Darren Aronofsky, Paramount Spar Over 'Noah' Final Cut (Exclusive). The Hollywood Reporter. October 15, 2013. Retrieved October 16, 2013. Besides the fictional land-based animals in the film, ILM was also responsible for creating the Watchers, the forest that sprouted from the seed, the deluge sequence during the battle between the Watchers and Tubal-cain and his army, and the two-minute-long sequence of the history of Earth's creation. =Music= The musical score for Noah was composed by Clint Mansell, who scored the music for all of Aronofsky's previous feature films, and is performed by Kronos Quartet. A soundtrack album was released by Nonesuch Records on March 26, 2014. The score also features an original song by Patti Smith, which is a lullaby sung by both Russell Crowe's and Emma Watson's characters during the film. Smith performs the song herself over the end credits. =Themes= The president of the National Religious Broadcasters stated that the Noah film includes \\"major biblical themes\\" including \\"sin, judgment, righteousness, and God as Creator.\\" In addition, the film promotes the concept of evolutionary creation. Ari Handel, the scriptwriter for the Noah film stated that Commenting on God's mercy, Wesley Hill in First Things notes that \\"near the end of the film, Emma Watson's character, Ila ... says to Noah that perhaps God preserved him because God knew that he had a merciful heart\\" and that \\"the film ends up locating the rationale for God's mercy in some native spark of goodness in Noah that will, viewers hope, make the new, post-flood world more livable than the antediluvian one.\\" =Test screenings= In mid-2013, Aronofsky and Paramount began sparring over final cut, with Paramount seeking to test unfinished, unscored, and alternate cuts of the film despite Aronofsky's objections. Paramount proceeded with test- screening the film nonetheless, prompting \\"worrisome\\" responses from largely religious audiences in October 2013. \\"They tried what they wanted to try, and eventually they came back. My version of the film hasn't been tested ... It's what we wrote and what was green-lighted.\\" After much discussion and compromise, the studio announced on February 12 that Darren Aronofsky's version, not any of the studio's alternate versions, would be the final cut of Noah. Under pressure from Christian religious groups, Paramount Pictures added a disclaimer to marketing materials in February 2014, saying: > \\"The film is inspired by the story of Noah. While artistic license has been > taken, we believe that this film is true to the essence, values and > integrity of a story that is a cornerstone of faith for millions of people > worldwide. The biblical story of Noah can be found in the book of Genesis.\\" Release =Box office= Noah had its world premiere in Mexico City on March 10, 2014. In North America, the film grossed a little over $43.7 million during its opening box office weekend, becoming Aronofsky's highest opening weekend and his first film to open at No. 1. The opening weekend was also the biggest ever for Russell Crowe as a lead actor. Internationally, the film's releases in Russia and Brazil were the largest-ever for a non-sequel, and were the fourth-biggest openings of all time with $17.2 million and $9.8 million, respectively. The opening in Russia was the largest-ever for a Paramount film. In South Korea, the film grossed $1.1 million on its opening day, the highest in 2014 for the territory. Noah grossed $101.2 million in North America and $261.4 million in other countries, making a worldwide gross of $362.6 million. The film was declared \\"an unmitigated hit ... by almost every measure.\\" =Tie-in events= In connection with the release of the film in North America, Aronofsky commissioned artists to create original works inspired by the Biblical story of Noah, stating that \\"The Noah story belongs to all of us—every religion, every culture, every citizen of planet Earth.\\" The collection, titled Fountains of the Deep: Visions of Noah and Flood was open to the public for the month of March 2014 in the Soho district of New York City. Contributing artists included Ugo Rondinone, Karen Kilimnik, Mike Nelson, Nan Goldin, Jim Lee, Robert Liefeld, Jim Woodring, Simon Bisley, graffiti duo FAILE and James Jean. On the eve of the film's release in Reykjavik, Iceland, Aronofsky teamed up with Björk to host an environmental benefit concert in response to proposed anti-conservationist policy changes by the Icelandic government, with guest performances by Björk, Patti Smith, Lykke Li, Russell Crowe, and Of Monsters and Men. =Home media= Noah was released on Blu-ray Disc and DVD on July 29, 2014. In August 2014 a 3D Blu-ray edition was also released in Italy and Germany. Reception =Critical response= The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 76% approval rating with an average rating of 6.66/10 based on 260 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \\"With sweeping visuals grounded by strong performances in service of a timeless tale told on a human scale, Darren Aronofsky's Noah brings the Bible epic into the 21st century.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 68 out of 100, based on 46 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Movielines Pete Hammond said that \\"It stays with you long after you leave the theatre. This 'Noah' is unlike any other film of its kind—an intimate and stirring new take on a biblical story we only thought we knew.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said of the film: \\"a film of grit, grace, and visual wonders that for all its tech-head modernity is built on a spiritual core ... In this flawed, fiercely relevant film, wonders never cease.\\" Times Richard Corliss said, \\"Darren Aronofsky brings out wild ambition and thrilling artistry to one of the Old Testament's best-known, most dramatic, least plausible stories — Noah and the Ark — with Russell Crowe infusing the role of God's first seaman and zookeeper with all his surly majesty.\\" Kathleen Parker, writing in The Washington Post, called the film \\"Noah's Arc of Triumph\\" and said of the film: \\"If you like Braveheart, Gladiator, Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings, Indiana Jones, or Titanic, you will like Noah. If you like two or more of the above, you will love Noah.\\" Richard Roeper called it \\"One of the most dazzling and unforgettable Biblical epics ever put on film.\\" The film also had its detractors. IndieWire claimed \\"Aronofsky's worst movie is an epic misfire that, like the source material, offers plenty of lessons even if you don't buy the whole package.\\" The Wrap called the film \\"Darren Aronofsky's Biblical Waterworld\\". The New Yorkers David Denby wrote: \\"Darren Aronofsky's Noah—an epic farrago of tumultuous water, digital battle, and environmentalist rage ... is the craziest big movie in years. Noah may not make much sense, but only an artist could have made it.\\" =Racial issues= The film was challenged for its lack of non-white characters. Reverend Wil Gafney, associate professor of Hebrew and Old Testament at the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia, sees the film as a throwback to the Hollywood era of all white casts and considers it worrisome in today's more multi-ethnic America. She goes on to state that \\"The Bible is the most multicultural piece of literature that most people will ever read. So a film about the Bible should reflect that diversity.\\" Efrem Smith, of Los Angeles-based World Impact, critiques the film as a throwback to the 1956 classic The Ten Commandments, where an all-white cast played Moses and Pharaoh. Smith states that Noah deals with the curse of Ham by \\"simply erasing people of color from the story.\\" Anthea Butler, an associate professor of religious studies at the University of Pennsylvania, said the casting choices send a worrying message: \\"It's a world where only white people get saved ... this doesn't look like the world that God created.\\" However, \\"fittingly for a Biblical story\\", two of the characters are played by Jewish actors (Jennifer Connelly and Logan Lerman). Co-writer Ari Handel addressed the issues around race in an interview, where he stated, \\"From the beginning, we were concerned about casting, the issue of race. What we realized is that this story is functioning at the level of myth, and as a mythical story, the race of the individuals doesn't matter.\\"http://www.thehighcalling.org/culture/noah#.U8_O_PmSypf Stewardship of Creation: An Interview with \\"Noah\\" Screenwriter, Ari Handel =Christian and Jewish response= Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury and leader of the worldwide Anglican Communion, called the Noah film \\"interesting and thought- provoking\\" after the film's lead star, Russell Crowe travelled to Lambeth Palace in order to discuss with him \\"faith and spirituality\\" after the film's British premiere. In addition, several Christian organizations have expressed support for the Noah film, \\"including leaders from organizations like the American Bible Society, National Catholic Register, The King's College, Q Ideas, Hollywood Prayer Network, and Focus on the Family.\\" Focus on the Family president Jim Daly stated that: \\"[Noah] is a creative interpretation of the scriptural account that allows us to imagine the deep struggles Noah may have wrestled with as he answered God's call on his life. This cinematic vision of Noah's story gives Christians a great opportunity to engage our culture with the biblical Noah, and to have conversations with friends and family about matters of eternal significance.\\" Cultural commenter Bishop Robert Barron praised the film for its inclusion of \\"God, creation, providence, sin, obedience, salvation: not bad for a major Hollywood movie!\\" Darren Aronofsky later tweeted Barron's \\"thoughts\\" were a \\"smart take.\\" Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, an orthodox Jewish rabbi leader, hailed Noah as \\"a valuable film, especially for our times.\\" In order to create \\"a story that tries to explicate Noah's relationship with God and God's relationship with the world as it has become\\", director of the film Darren Aronofsky himself stated that he was working in \\"the tradition of Jewish Midrash\\". Noah has also been the subject of controversy with Christians who take issue with how the story has been portrayed. This is primarily in how the film used extra-biblical non-canonical Jewish sources as inspiration for elements of the script and not just the book of Genesis. In particular the film heavily incorporated elements of the Book of Enoch's version of the story including, but not limited to, the Nephilim. Ken Ham and Ray Comfort, both young earth creationists, objected to the film, with the latter apologist creating his own documentary, Noah and the Last Days, as a response. The director angered many in the religious community by stating that his version of \\"Noah\\" was the \\"least-biblical biblical film ever made\\". Despite references to \\"The Creator\\", some still disliked the film because God is not mentioned by name. Jerry Johnson, president of the National Religious Broadcasters, did not like the director's description of Noah as the \\"first environmentalist\\". Johnson called the film's \\"insertion of the extremist environmental agenda\\" a major concern. Producer Scott Franklin told Entertainment Weekly, \\"Noah is a very short section of the Bible with a lot of gaps, so we definitely had to take some creative expression in it. But I think we stayed very true to the story and didn't really deviate from the Bible, despite the six-armed angels.\\" Kevin Hall, Ph.D., professor of biblical and theological studies and the Ida Elizabeth and J.W. Hollums chair of Bible at Oklahoma Baptist University observed that \\"the story in Genesis is extremely concise, so some creativity with the tale—especially by Hollywood—is hardly a surprise.\\" =Muslim response and censorship= The film was banned in Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Malaysia, and Indonesia prior to its release because it is seen by the governments of those countries as contradicting the teachings of Islam. A representative of Paramount Pictures stated, \\"Censors for Qatar, Bahrain and the UAE officially confirmed this week that the film will not release in their countries.\\" The film was also disapproved by the Al-Azhar University in Egypt since it violates Islamic law and could \\"provoke the feelings of believers\\". Mohammad Zareef from Pakistan's Central Board of Film Censors said they tended to steer clear of films with a religious theme, adding, \\"We haven't seen it yet, but I don't think it can go to the cinemas in Pakistan.\\" However, the DVD release was to be available in Pakistan. In many Islamic juristic schools, the portrayal of prophets such as Noah is forbidden. Noah is also banned in Indonesia, with the censorship institution stating \\"religious reasons\\" for the ban but declining to further comment on the matter.

Barish at Nobel Prize press conference in Stockholm, December 2017) Barry Clark Barish (born January 27, 1936) is an American experimental physicist and Nobel Laureate. He is a Linde Professor of Physics, emeritus at California Institute of Technology and a leading expert on gravitational waves. In 2017, Barish was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics along with Rainer Weiss and Kip Thorne \\"for decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves\\". In 2018, he joined the faculty at University of California, Riverside, becoming the university's second Nobel Prize winner on the faculty. Birth and education Barish was born in Omaha, Nebraska, the son of Lee and Harold Barish.https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:K999-5XC His parents' families were Jewish immigrants from a part of Poland that is now in Belarus.Hillside Memorial Park Jewish Cemetery in Los Angeles Just after World War II, the family moved to Los Feliz in Los Angeles. He attended John Marshall High School and other schools. He earned a B.A. degree in physics (1957) and a Ph.D. degree in experimental high energy physics (1962) at the University of California, Berkeley. He joined Caltech in 1963 as part of a new experimental effort in particle physics using frontier particle accelerators at the national laboratories. From 1963 to 1966, he was a research fellow, and from 1966 to 1991 an Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, and Professor of Physics. From 1991 to 2005, he became Linde Professor of Physics, and after that Linde Professor of Physics, Emeritus.https://labcit.ligo.caltech.edu/~BCBAct/BCB_CV0316.pdf From 1984 to 1996, he was the principal investigator of Caltech High Energy Physics Group. Research Firstly, Barish's experiments were performed at Fermilab using high-energy neutrino collisions to reveal the quark substructure of the nucleon. Among others, these experiments were the first to observe a current that was weak and neutral, a linchpin of the electroweak unification theories of Salam, Glashow, and Weinberg. In the 1980s, he directed MACRO, an experiment in a cave in Gran Sasso, Italy, that searched for exotic particles called magnetic monopoles and also studied penetrating cosmic rays, including neutrino measurements that provided important confirmatory evidence that neutrinos have mass and oscillate. In 1991, Barish was named the Maxine and Ronald Linde Professor of Physics at Caltech. In the early 1990s, he spearheaded GEM (Gammas, Electrons, Muons), an experiment that would have run at the Superconducting Super Collider which was approved after the former project L* led by Samuel Ting (and Barish as chairman of collaboration board) was rejected by SSC director Roy Schwitters. Barish was GEM spokesperson. Barish became the principal investigator of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) in 1994 and director in 1997. He led the effort through the approval of funding by the NSF National Science Board in 1994, the construction and commissioning of the LIGO interferometers in Livingston, LA and Hanford, WA in 1997. He created the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, which now numbers more than 1000 collaborators worldwide to carry out the science. The initial LIGO detectors reached design sensitivity and set many limits on astrophysical sources. The Advanced LIGO proposal was developed while Barish was director, and he has continued to play a leading role in LIGO and Advanced LIGO. The first detection of the merger of two 30 solar mass black holes was made on September 14, 2015. Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger, PhysRevLett.116.061102. This represented the first direct detection of gravitational waves since they were predicted by Einstein in 1916 and the first ever observation of the merger of a pair of black holes. Barish delivered the first presentation on this discovery to a scientific audience at CERN on February 11, 2016, simultaneously with the public announcement. From 2001 to 2002, Barish served as co-chair of the High Energy Physics Advisory Panel subpanel that developed a long-range plan for U.S. high energy physics. He has chaired the Commission of Particles and Fields and the U.S. Liaison committee to the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP). In 2002, he chaired the NRC Board of Physics and Astronomy Neutrino Facilities Assessment Committee Report, \\"Neutrinos and Beyond\\". From 2005 to 2013, Barish was Director of the Global Design Effort for the International Linear Collider (ILC). The ILC is the highest priority future project for particle physics worldwide, as it promises to complement the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in exploring the TeV energy scale. This ambitious effort is being uniquely coordinated worldwide, representing a major step in international collaborations going from conception to design to implementation for large scale projects in physics. Honors and awards In 2002, he received the Klopsteg Memorial Award of the American Association of Physics Teachers. Barish was honored by the University of Bologna (2006) and University of Florida ( 2007) where he received honorary doctorates. In 2007, delivered the Van Vleck lectures at the University of Minnesota. The University of Glasgow honored Barish with an honorary degree of science in 2013. Barish was honored as a Titan of Physics in the On the Shoulders of Giants series at the 2016 World Science Festival. In 2016, Barish received the Enrico Fermi Prize \\"for his fundamental contributions to the formation of the LIGO and LIGO-Virgo scientific collaborations and for his role in addressing challenging technological and scientific aspects whose solution led to the first detection of gravitational waves\\". Barish was a recipient of the 2016 Smithsonian magazine's American Ingenuity Award in the Physical Science category. Barish was awarded the 2017 Henry Draper Medal from the National Academy of Sciences \\"for his visionary and pivotal leadership role, scientific guidance, and novel instrument design during the development of LIGO that were crucial for LIGO's discovery of gravitational waves from colliding black holes, thus directly validating Einstein's 100-year-old prediction of gravitational waves and ushering a new field of gravitational wave astronomy.\\" Barish was a recipient of the 2017 Giuseppe and Vanna Cocconi Prize of the European Physical Society for his \\"pioneering and leading role in the LIGO observatory that led to the direct detection of gravitational waves, opening a new window to the Universe.\\" Barish was a recipient of the 2017 Princess of Asturias Award for his work on gravitational waves (jointly with Kip Thorne and Rainer Weiss). Barish was a recipient of the 2017 Fudan- Zhongzhi Science Award for his leadership in the construction and initial operations of LIGO, the creation of the international LIGO Scientific Collaboration, and for the successful conversion of LIGO from small science executed by a few research groups into big science that involved large collaborations and major infrastructures, which eventually enabled gravitational-wave detection\\" (jointly with Kip Thorne and Rainer Weiss). In 2017, he won the Nobel Prize in Physics (jointly with Rainer Weiss and Kip Thorne) \\"for decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves\\". In 2018, Barish was honored as the Alumnus of the year by the University of California, Berkeley. In 2018, he received an honorary doctorate at Southern Methodist University.

He came to office at a time a large part of the province of Santa Fe de Nuevo México was independent of Spanish rule due to the Pueblo Revolt. With limited resources, he was unable to reconquer the province. Early career Domingo Jironza Pétriz de Cruzate was born around 1640 in the province of Huesca in Aragon, Spain. Possibly he was the Domingo Xironza who married Sebastiana de Oquendo in Mexico City on 30 April 1663. If so, he was the son of Antonio Xironza and Ana Mangues Pérez. He joined the Spanish armed forces and served in the wars between Spain and Portugal. On 10 April 1680 Jironza sailed from Cadiz as Captain in command of fifty soldiers, bound for New Spain. On his arrival the viceroy, Payo Enríquez de Rivera, made him mayor of Metztitlán, an office that he held until 1682. New Mexico governor The Spanish were driven out of New Mexico in 1680 after the Pueblo Revolt. In 1683 Jironza was appointed Captain General and Governor of the New Mexico frontier, with the mandate of fighting the Apaches and attempting to re-conquer the territory. His headquarters were at El Paso del Norte. On 15 October 1683 a party of seven Jumano Indians from La Junta de los Ríos, at the junction of the Rio Conchos and Rio Grande near modern-day Presidio, Texas, came to El Paso, asking for the Spanish to send missionaries to their country and beyond. Their spokesman, Juan Sabeata, talked of the great wealth of these lands, and those of the great kingdom of Texas that lay beyond. Jironza sent Juan Domínguez de Mendoza, an experienced militia leader, and Fray Nicolás López to explore the Jumano country and establish missions. The expedition left El Paso on 15 December 1683, going down the Rio Grande to La Junta, then on to the Edwards Plateau. They spent six weeks there, building a fort as defense against Apaches near the location of modern San Angelo, Texas, and hunting buffalo for hides and food. They fed and baptized many of the friendly local people who visited their camp. On their return, Domínguez and López made a strong case for sending soldiers and missionaries to the Jumano country. However, Governor Jironza was unable to help since his forces were tied up fighting the Pueblos. On March 14, 1684, friendly Tiwas and Piros told Jironza of a Manso plot to kill all the Spaniards in El Paso. The Mansos were \\"tired of everything having to do with God and with the church, which is why they wanted to do what the Indians of New Mexico had done.\\" The Spanish imprisoned the ringleaders of the plot, who included an Apache and a Quivira Indian (probably a Wichita). Ten of them were executed. Later, in November, the Spanish garrison of 60 men plus friendly Indians attacked a gathering of hostile Indians who apparently intended to carry out the plot. Jironza led an expedition against the Apaches in 1684. He was not given sufficient soldiers to effect the reconquest of New Mexico, because resources were held back due to rumours that the French were conducting an expedition in Texas, and preventing this would be the higher priority. This was the invasion of eastern Texas by René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle in 1685. In 1685 Jironza made an effort to collect the refugees from New Mexico who had disobeyed royal orders and left the El Paso area. Jironza was temporarily removed from office in 1686 since his activities in the Nueva Vizcaya region had caused conflict with both the church and the civil authorities. Jironza's successor Pedro Reneros de Posada proved ineffective and Jironza was reinstated in 1688 or 1689. His first action was to march north, where he sacked and burned Zia Pueblo. This was the bloodiest engagement during the Pueblo Revolt, causing the Indians to abandon their settlements and retreat into the mountains. Six hundred Indians were killed, but the Spanish again did not have sufficient resources to follow through, and Jironza was forced to retire to El Paso. On this expedition he was accompanied by seventy Franciscan Friars. He was planning to make another effort to reconquer New Mexico in 1691, but had to cancel the expedition while he dealt with uprisings by the Suma Indians to the south of El Paso. He was succeeded as governor that year by Diego de Vargas. Documents apparently signed by Jironza in 1689 granted land to eleven Pueblos. However, two centuries later these were found to be forgeries. His successor, Captain General Diego de Vargas Zapata Lujan Ponce de León y Contreras, set out from El Paso around the end of August 1692, and took possession of Santa Fe on 14 September 1692 without having to fight. Later career Jironza was made captain of the mobile Presidio de las Fronteras de Sonora force in 1691, operating from various temporary bases on the northern frontier, the last being the mining camp of San Juan Bautista de Sonora. He fought against the Apaches, Janos, Jocomes, Upper Pimas, and Sumas. His nephew Juan Mateo Mange left Spain to join his uncle in 1692. He was appointed lieutenant, alcade mayor and capitan á guerra, and was given the duty of accompanying the missionaries in Sonora and recording their discoveries. These reports provide an excellent source of information on the exploration of northern Sonora. In 1701 Domingo Jironza Pétriz de Cruzate was replaced as captain by General Jacinto de Fuensaldaña. He remained in San Juan Bautista after his retirement. The last record that mentions him is dated September 1708, when he was mayordomo of the community church.

Though it performed as well as its conventional contemporaries, it did not offer sufficiently improved performance to compensate for its difficult handling characteristics. Design and development The Akaflieg Braunschweig or Akademische Fliegergruppe Braunschweig () is one of some fourteen German undergraduate student flying groups attached to and supported by their home Technical University. Several have designed and built aircraft, often technically advanced and leading the development of gliders in particular. In 1982 when the SB-13 design was first discussed no new tailless glider had been built for thirty years, during which time glass reinforced plastic materials had replaced wood in glider construction and much learned about laminar flow wings; it was hoped that tailless designs would be lighter, simpler and cheaper. Work on the SB-13 Arcus, named after the cloud formation, began in 1982. Because of the novelty of the layout, a one-third scale model of the early design was built and flown, revealing several serious problems. Strong flutter was experienced even at modest speed and the aircraft was very sensitive to the centre of gravity (c.g.) position. It stalled readily when this was too far aft. Recovery from the spin that followed was difficult. With the c.g. too far forward, a rapid longitudinal \\"pecking\\" oscillation set in which, because of its short period, was hard to control. Major redesign, involving long and difficult computer analysis led to a new wing with carbon fibre stiffening on the main spar; in addition, both it and the wing plan were made curved. The new structure resisted flutter until was reached. The full scale SB-13 finally flew in 1988. Its wing was straight edged, with three slightly tapered sections of increasing sweep. The two inner panels occupied less than of the span and the outer section leading edge was swept at about 17°. All had a dihedral of 4°. At its tips, where the chord was , the wing turned upwards into tall, slightly swept winglets, which carried rudders. Elevons occupied much of the outer panel trailing edge and, further inboard, mid-chord mounted airbrakes were fitted. The fuselage, onto which the wings were mounted between low and mid position was a short pod with its nose a little ahead of the centre section leading edge, extending aft about as far as the trailing horizontal edge of the wing at its tip. The pilot reclined under a long, bulged, single piece canopy, which was side hinged to starboard. The cockpit reached beyond the wing both forward and aft, with the main spar passing through it under the pilot's knees. Despite the modifications made to remove the handling problems predicted by the model, the full scale SB-13 still \\"pecked\\" and spun readily; when the standard spin correction procedure was applied, a new spin started in the opposite direction. Over the next few years several aerodynamic devices were tried, some of which at least improved the behaviour of the Arcus; one longer-lasting outcome from the project was the start of an investigation into whole aircraft rescue parachutes. The competition performance of the Arcus was on a par with that of other 15 m gliders of the time but it did not offer the great improvement over them which might have justified even more effort to improve the handling. Operational history The sole SB-13 was flown, modified and studied from 1988 to 2000, when it was damaged and set aside in favour of newer aircraft. In 2007 it went to the Deutsches Museum, Munich for exhibition. Aircraft on display * SB-13 D-1113 is on display in the Deutsches Museum Flugwerft Schleissheim.

The dye is not injected into the tissue, but between two layers of the eye, where it spreads out over a large area. The process is not common. Some procedures have caused loss of vision, severe permanent pain, and loss of the eye.Scleral Tattoo Gone Wrong, Clinical Videos, American Academy of Ophthalmology, By Paul R Freund and Mark Greve, MAY 16, 2017  History  In late 2007, Body Modification Ezine wrote an article describing the first three scleral tattoo procedures performed on sighted eyes. The artist known as Luna Cobra (Howard \\"Howie\\" Rollins) experimented on three volunteers; Shannon Larratt, Joshua Matthew Rahn and Paul Mowery (aka \\"Pauly Unstoppable\\", today known as Farrah Flawless).A sad and premature goodbye to Josh RahnEyeball Tattoo Interview, Five Years LaterA Look at Eyeball Tattoos and Extreme Body Modifications  HuffPost Larratt got the idea after Dutch eye surgeon Gerrit R. J. Melles gave Shannon's then-wife Rachel Larratt an eye implant.JewelEye (Sung to the tune of Goldfinger) [The Publisher's Ring] The technique is similar to the established method practiced by eye surgeons who use implants on their patients for various eye problems, with the difference that it is performed for aesthetic reasons on healthy eyes with visible implants.Dressing up the windows to the soul - The Age She had a small piece of thin platinum jewelry inserted over the sclera, which is the white layer of the eye, and under the conjunctiva, which is a clear layer covering the sclera. The method Melles had developed included injecting a small drop of saline in order to create a fluid filled pocket before inserting the implant into this pocket, which would gradually shrink and leave only the jewelry behind. Shannon then imagined the saline being replaced with ink, which would spread and end up as a colored layer between the sclera and the conjunctiva, giving the white of the eye a new color.The Eyeball Tattoo FAQ  BME: Tattoo, Piercing and Body Modification Being a fan of Frank Herbert's Dune, Shannon had photoshopped the eyes of his own picture to look like the blue eyes of the Fremen in the novel. He and Luna Cobra then tried to figure out how to color his eyes permanently blue. Eventually Cobra agreed to give it a try if Shannon could find two other people willing to have their eyeballs colored (of these three only Farrah is still alive, making her the person in the world who has had sclera tattoos for the longest period of time).Nothing bad about the fad? Both Larratt and Rahn died from causes unrelated to the procedure. Luna Cobra tried two different procedures, the first covering the needle with ink and puncturing the eye. This method was deemed unsuccessful, and the second method was attempted. This procedure, in which the sclera was injected with blue dye, was successful. The procedures were \\"effectively painless because there aren't nerve endings in the surface of the eye,\\" says the article's author Shannon Larratt. The aftereffects include \\"fairly minor\\" pain, bruising, and some discomfort. Also, the author, who had the procedure performed on himself, seems to have some blisters between the sclera and conjunctiva. The author twice indicates the risks and possible complications, the most important including blindness, of the procedure and warns that it should not be performed without a professional. Scleral tattooing is still a new body modification, and potential longterm effects have therefore still not manifested themselves.  Legislation  In 2009 the Oklahoma Senate passed Senate Bill 844, filed by Oklahoma Senator Cliff Branan and supported by the Oklahoma Academy of Ophthalmology, to make it illegal to tattoo the sclera of the eye.\\"Week in Review the Oklahoma Senate.\\" 31 Oct. 2009 .

History Hillsborough School was constructed by the architects Wilson & Masters. At the time of construction, the Hillsborough area was a rural location outside the City of Sheffield and within the parish of Ecclesfield so it fell to the Ecclesfield School Board to instigate the building of a school for the area. The Board borrowed £5,745 from the Public Works Loan Commissioners to build the school. Hillsborough Board School, as it was then known, was opened on 7 July 1884 by George Dawson, Chairman of the School Board, it had a department for older children as well as an infants section. By October 1886 there were 431 pupils in the school and in March 1892, a separate department for the older girls was created. The school became within the jurisdiction of Sheffield Council on 1 November 1901 when the boundaries of the city were extended, encompassing the Hillsborough area, at this time the school name was changed to Hillsborough Council School and there were over 600 pupils. In 1958 the school lost its senior section when the older pupils were transferred to the newly built Chaucer School and Hillsborough became solely a junior school. In October 1982 a nursery was opened on the site. Sheffield Indexers. School Centennial Booklet gives history.

She worked in both California and Alaska, dying in a crash during the first Women's Air Derby. She was inducted into the Alaska Women's Hall of Fame in 2011. Early life She was born to Esler Crosson and his wife Elizabeth Wynant Crosson in Warsaw, Indiana, the hometown of Elizabeth Crosson. Her brother Joe was born in Minneapolis, Kansas, where the family lived on a ranch. Another sister Zelma was born later. The family relocated to Sterling, Colorado. Aviation career In 1922, the Crosson family moved to San Diego, California. Marvel and Joe became fascinated with aviation and together bought their first airplane, a Curtiss N-9. Joe Crosson moved to the Territory of Alaska to take a job as a pilot. Marvel followed soon afterwards, and earned her commercial pilot's license there, the first woman in the territory to do so. She joined her brother in his business, piloting and keeping the equipment in working order. She helped her brother transport a monoplane from San Diego to New York for Hubert Wilkins. After working as a commercial pilot in Alaska, Marvel returned to California. She set an altitude record of on May 28, 1929, while piloting a Travel Air Jet J-5. Death Marvel Crosson died on August 19, 1929, when her airplane crashed in the Arizona desert on the second day of the Women's Air Derby that had begun in California. Her body was found several hundred feet from her plane. Crosson's parachute had been released, but was unopened, possibly indicating that she was too near the ground for it to work properly after being released. She was entombed at Greenwood Memorial Park in San Diego, California. Race sponsor National Exchange Club held a nationwide moment of silence in all its clubs to commemorate Crosson's death.

Panoramic view from Mt. Mtatsminda down on Rustaveli Avenue in 2009 The accident involved two gondolas on a ropeway route between Rustaveli Avenue and Mount Mtatsminda.Tbilisi Ropeways. Civil Georgia. 2012. Red gondola number 1 was on its way down from the slope of the mountain, nearing the lower supporting tower, and red gondola number 2 was nearing an upper tower, when the hauling rope broke inside the coupler of the upper gondola. Both gondolas rolled down simultaneously. The lower gondola slammed into the wall of the lower station, killing four and injuring many others. The upper gondola generated a higher speed (the length of ropeway was ); on reaching the lower support tower, it struck the broken hauling rope, which was hanging on the tower, causing the cable to tear the gondola apart. The collision was so strong that the track cable fell off the tower, dangling the cut-open gondola above the rooftops. This also caused the cabin to slide further down, striking the roof of a six-storey building below. This caused even further destruction to the gondola and caused people to fall onto the rooftops and ground below. Twenty people were killed and at least 15 badly injured. Most were children on a sightseeing tour to Tbilisi from School Number 5 of the regional town of Akhaltsikhe, to celebrate Children's Day. Surviving witnesses from both gondolas say that the brakes did not work in either of the gondolas, despite the desperate attempts of guides and passengers who helped them to pull the brakes. In 1988, two years prior to the accident, the cable car underwent major reconstruction under the lead of head engineer Vakhtang Lejava. Originally the cable car used three supporting towers. Redesigning this meant replacing the lower mast with a new mast. Two short upper masts ( high) were also replaced by one mast. Prior to this change, the gondolas had a slight climbing angle on the two upper masts. Using a single higher mast caused the new gondolas to run from the upper station horizontal to the mast and then, with a sharp angle, head down. The standard oval Georgian gondolas (with a capacity of 25 per gondola), produced in Tbilisi by Tbilisi Aircraft Manufacturing, were replaced by Italian larger rectangular ones built by \\"Lovisolo\\" and provided by \\"Ceretti & Tanfani\\", providing greater passenger capacity (40 per gondola). The braking system of the new gondolas did not function properly – while climbing over the upper mast, the braking system would incorrectly engage. The service staff would have to climb on top of the gondola and turn it off manually when this occurred. To avoid this inconvenience, the brakes were just turned off. Additionally, on the day of the accident, both gondolas were over-capacity: the lower gondola had 46 passengers on board, the upper gondola held 47 passengers. Accident investigation documentation does not identify the cause of the hauling rope breaking inside the coupler. Many unanswered questions still remain, and the cause of the accident is not known. The track and hauling cables were dismantled while the damaged gondolas were dismantled after three years. The masts and the stations were kept intact. The aerial tramway was never restored. In 2014, the upper station and both supporting masts were dismantled due to planned restoration of the tramway as a reversible gondola cable car, running from a relocated lower station. However, the upper station location remained the same. The old lower station, due to its unique architecture, is a cultural heritage object. The planned restoration was abandoned due to local opposition and visual flaws of the new lower station on one of the main squares of the city in front of Radisson Hotel. Another issue with the restoration was the oversized five supporting masts, two of them being located on hilly streets, causing already narrow streets to reduce even more in width. As of January 2017, an aerial tramway is under construction from the original lower station, with the location of the upper station remaining the same. The work will be carried out by Doppelmayr Garaventa Group. The major challenge is to adapt the lower station backyard for a monocable detachable gondola infrastructure, because the lower station was only designed for aerial tramway type of cable car in 1958. Construction has faced problems because of the high density small housing which appeared in the backyard of the lower station throughout the years and the area near the future lower mast being challenging for big lorries with construction materials to approach.

Mobile Gas Service Corp., 350 U.S. 332 (1956), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court interpreted the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (NGA) as not allowing a gas supply company to unilaterally modify rates in a natural gas supply contract by filing a new rate schedule with the Federal Power Commission (FPC).. Mobile Gas and its companion case Federal Power Commission v. Sierra Pacific Power Co.. established the Mobile- Sierra presumption which holds that an electricity or natural gas supply rate established resulting from a freely negotiated contract is presumed to be \\"just and reasonable\\" and thus acceptable under the NGA or Federal Power Act (FPA). Background The NGA was enacted in 1938 to regulate the interstate natural gas industry, including gas pipeline companies. The NGA regulated the rates charged by gas companies to their customers, which included local gas distribution companies and industrial users, through the filing by gas companies of rate schedules and contracts with customers. The NGA required gas companies to file tariffs of their new rates with the FPC, a federal administrative agency, at least thirty days prior to their becoming effective, and authorized the FPC to investigate rates to determine if they were in the public interest. The FPC could also suspend rates except for those involving gas supplied to industrial users while the investigating the rates. In 1946 the Ideal Cement Company wanted to construct a cement plant in Mobile, Alabama. The local natural gas distribution company, Mobile Gas Service Company, entered into a ten-year contract with the United Gas Pipe Line Company to obtain gas at 10.7 cents per thousand cubic feet, which was at a substantially lower price than that charged for other gas customers, so that it could then provide the gas to the cement plant at 12 cents per thousand cubic feet. The contract between Mobile Gas and United Gas was filed with and approved by the FPC, and became part of the tariff and contracts on file for United Gas. In June 1953 United Gas filed a new rate schedule with the FPC which purported to increase the rate for the natural gas for resale to the Ideal Cement plant to 14.5 cents per thousand cubic feet, which was a rate closer to that paid by other gas customers. Mobile Gas objected, stating that under the NGA United Gas could not unilaterally change the contract rate. The FPC ruled that the new rate, being a non-suspendable industrial rate under the NGA, would automatically become effective thirty days after it was filed unless it found the rate to be unlawful. Mobile Gas paid the new rate until April 15, 1955, when it assigned its contract with Ideal Cement to United Gas with the approval of the FPC. Since the only remaining issue was the alleged excess payment resulting from the difference between 10.7 and 14.5 cents per thousand cubic feet that Mobil Gas had paid to United Gas while responsible for the contract, the FPC ended its investigation regarding the validity of the new rate as it believed that its ruling would not have a retroactive effect. Mobile Gas appealed the administrative decision of the FPC to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which reversed the decision and directed the FPC to reject the new tariffed rate in question and to order United Gas to refund the excess payments received under the new rate. The FPC and United Gas appealed the circuit court order to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari. Opinion The unanimous opinion by Justice Harlan noted that there was no allegation that the NGA was unconstitutional, so the only issue in the case involved the statutory interpretation of the NGA. The opinion stated that the provision in the NGA requiring the filing of rate schedules was not a rate setting procedure, but a prerequisite to the establishment of new rates. While the NGA required a gas company to file new rates and contracts with the FPC, it did not authorize the abrogation of any contract in effect. The FPC could investigate rates in contracts, but contracts could be modified or rejected by the FPC only if the rate in the contract was found to be so low as to be harmful to third parties and not in the public interest. Thus, a gas company had no authority to unilaterally change a rate in a contract by filing a new rate schedule with the FPC. The opinion also explained that the NGA was different from the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA) then in effect, which required transportation companies to use the same rate schedule for all customers and did not authorize special rates to be set by contract with individual customers as the large number of customers engaged in interstate commerce did not permit an administrative agency to review contracts with special rates. In comparison, there were relatively few gas companies and customers, and the NGA’s authorization to set rates using contracts recognized that dedicated infrastructure and capacity with individualized costs might be required for a gas company to serve a customer. Based on this difference, the Court then distinguished the prior case of Armour Packing Co. v. United States (1908),. where a contract between a shipper and a railroad used the same rate as in a rate schedule filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). The railroad later filed a new rate schedule with the ICC. The Supreme Court held in that case that the new rate applied as the ICA, unlike the NGA, required the same rate schedule for all customers. As the NGA did not authorize a gas company to change rates specified in its contracts unilaterally, the new rate schedule filed by United Gas was a nullity with respect to the gas provided for the Ideal Cement plant. As such, United Gas was required to refund the excess payments made under the new rate schedule to Mobile Gas. Subsequent events The Supreme Court in the companion case FPC v. Sierra Pacific Power Co. found a similar result regarding contracts filed with the FPC involving electricity sales under the FPA. In later cases, the validity of rates set by contracts between gas and electric transmission companies became known as the Mobile-Sierra presumption. Under this presumption, an electricity or gas rate specified in a freely negotiated contract is presumed to be “just and reasonable” and thus acceptable under the FPA or NGA. A later case which had facts similar to Mobile Gas, except that the contract between the gas pipeline company and customer stated that the applicable rate was the rate in the schedule filed with the FPC. In United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Memphis Light, Gas, and Water Division (1958),. the Supreme Court held that the gas company could revise the referenced gas rate in the contract by filing a new rate schedule with the FPC. The cost of natural gas supplied by United Gas to the cement plant in Mobile, Alabama was the subject of a later Supreme Court decision, United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Ideal Cement Co. (1962).. The issue in that case was whether United Gas could recoup the cost of a tax levied by the City of Mobile on natural gas sales. The Supreme Court vacated a lower court ruling that the tax was actually a means of licensing a pipeline company’s right to enter the state, and stated that federal courts should abstain from ruling on complex state law issues which have not yet been resolved. This form of federal court abstention is based on the case of Railroad Commission v. Pullman Co. (1941). and is known as the Pullman abstention doctrine. On October 1, 1977, the FPC was replaced by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission..

Oignies Abbey (; originally Priory of St Nicolas d'Oignies) is a former Augustinian monastery in Belgium. Established in 1187, it is situated on the banks of the Sambre River. Origin In 1187, four brothers from Walcourt settled at Oignies, Three of the brothers, Gilles, Robert and John, were priests, while the fourth, Hugo, was a jeweller and metalworker. Several other men settled with them and they formed the community of St. Nicolas of Oignies, adopting the rule of St. Augustine. In 1192, St Nicolas of Oignies was officially recognized as a priory by the order of the Canons of St. Augustine. Gilles becomes the first prior, a position that he held for 4l years. The community built a church dedicated to St. Nicolas, which was consecrated in 1204. Following major alterations it was reconsecrated in 1226. In circa 1230, Hugo presented to the monastery a manuscript and silver book covers, the book cover depicting Hugo as a layman, and the monastery's patron saint St. Nicolas. The women of this group settled in huts between the men's priory and the river. Marie of Oignies left her husband and arrived here in the first decade of the thirteenth century where she ran a community of beguines. Soon after, the cleric Jacques de Vitry arrived, and it was he who chronicled Marie's life after he became a priest. Hugo's medieval Gothic art pieces are recognized as \\"some of the most important examples of medieval Gothic metalwork\\". History Though the priory remained a community of 12 to 20 men, it eventually became an Augustinian monastery. Between the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries there were several fires. The wars in the southern Netherlands also caused destruction. In 1559, during the ecclesiastical reorganization of southern Netherlands, St Nicolas priory church became a part of the newly established Roman Catholic Diocese of Namur. It was suppressed in 1796. As with other monasteries, the priory's land parcels were sold and became public property. John Francis Pierlot, also known by his religious name Brother Gregory, was a native of Soignies and the 42nd and last prior of the abbey. In 1794, during the revolution, he left the Treasure of Hugo d'Oignies with a farmer and his wife in Falisolle, to prevent its confiscation by the state. In 1817, following the death of the farmer, it was retrieved from its hiding place, returning to the care of Father Pierlot. In 1818, he gave the Treasure to the Sisters of Notre Dame at Namur. After the revolution, however, some members of the religious community remained until 1808. In 1836, the new owner demolished the cloister. Some of the church furniture went to parish churches in the area, such as Saint Christopher (Charleroi) or St. Maarten (Ragnies). A statue of the Virgin from medieval times is now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Situated on 3 hectares in a park-like setting, the building is now privately owned and can be rented for events such as seminars, conventions, and weddings.

Established in 1906 as a mission station in German East Africa, the monastery is currently home to 71 monks. On 4 July 2015 the community elected Fr. Placidus Mtunguja OSB its 5th Abbot.http://www.ndanda.org/ History =Benedictines to Africa= The first Missionary Benedictines arrived in German East Africa in 1887, following the creation of the Prefecture Apostolic of South Zanzibar. A first mission, established at Pugu near Dar-es-Salaam, ended in disaster, as three missionaries were killed and four kidnapped during the anti-colonial Bushiri uprising. Efforts at evangelization continued, with mission stations being opened throughout southeast German East Africa. With the expansion of the indigenous Christian population, the territory was raised to an apostolic vicariate in 1902. However, the 1905 Maji Maji uprising dealt the Missionary Benedictines a further blow: many missionaries, including the vicariate's bishop, Cassian Spiß, were killed. =From Mission Station to Abbatia Nullius= In 1906, the Missionary Benedictines chose Ndanda as the site of a new mission. Located in southern Tanzania, 100 km from the Indian Ocean, the station would serve a population previously cared for by the missions of Nyangao and Lukuledi. In the early days of the mission, education was one of the main focuses of the Benedictines. Aided by indigenous catechists, missionaries successfully built a number of schools throughout the area, and proceeded to instruct young boarders. This service not only endeared the missionaries to the local community, but also contributed to the growth of the Christian population. Working in concert with the Missionary Benedictines of Saint Ottilien, the Missionary Benedictine Sisters of Tutzing endeavored to make the mission station of Ndanda a source of health care, in spite of the fact that many of the missionaries themselves succumbed to tropical diseases like malaria and black water fever. The sisters managed a dispensary and a hospital to care for the local population, created a leprosarium, and eventually established an accredited nursing school. As the mission continued to expand, so did the Vicariate of Dar-es-Salaam. In 1913, the southern third of the area became the Prefecture Apostolic of Lindi. Following the German defeat in World War I, the British governor of Tanganyika expelled the Missionary Benedictines from the area. Into the breach stepped the British White Fathers, the Swiss Capuchins, and, eventually, Swiss members of the Congregation, whose training had begun in Uznach in 1919. By the mid-1920s, the colonial government allowed the Germans to return. In 1927, Lindi became an abbatia nullius, making the superior of the monastery also the ordinary of the territory. Thus, Fr Gallus Steiger, who had been part of the post-war Swiss relief, became the first Abbot of Lindi. Around this time, the personnel at Ndanda numbered 13 priests and ten brothers. Four years after Lindi's elevation to abbatia nullius, the territory was divided into two portions: in the west, the Abbatia Nullius of Peramiho, under Abbot Gallus; in the east, the Abbatia Nullius of Ndanda, under Abbot Joachim Ammann. At the time of his abbatial blessing, the community included nine priests, 18 brothers, and ten sisters. =Expansion as an Abbey= World War II brought the internment of the German missionaries at Ndanda Abbey. Again, the Swiss Capuchins helped administer the territory in their absence. By 1946, the Germans were able to return and continue mission activity. Cultivating indigenous vocations was a slow process. The Missionary Sisters of Tutzing began accepting local candidates for a community of African Benedictine sisters in 1939, but the war interrupted this endeavor. Likewise, Bro. Patiens Holenstein began training African brothers in 1947, but did not meet with success. However, vocations from American and British abbeys provided Ndanda with an influx of new personnel. In 1949, Fr. Viktor Hälg succeeded Abbot Joachim as superior of the community. Two years later, Abbot-Bishop Viktor ordained Faustin Bwenje, the first indigenous priest of the Abbatia Nullius of Ndanda. As the monastic community expanded, their territory decreased. In 1963, Rome created the Diocese of Nachingwea in the western of the abbatia nullius. The remainder of the abbatia nullius became a diocese in 1972. The new bishop, a diocesan priest, took up residence in Mtwara. With this, Abbot-Bishop Viktor reverted to being the monastic community's religious superior. With the death of Abbot Viktor in 1975, Fr. Siegfried Hertlein became the third Abbot of Ndanda. After much discussion, the abbey finally opened a novitiate to train local monastic vocations. The first postulants were received in 1989. This development demonstrated the transition of Ndanda from being a mission station with a Benedictine orientation to being a monastery with a concern for cultivating a local Benedictine monasticism. Abbot Father Dionys Lindenmaier served as the fourth abbot from 2002 to 2015. He was succeeded by Abbot Placid Mtunggua, the first African. At the time of his abbatial benediction, about a third of the community still consisted of European monks.Schweiklberger Missionsnachrichten vom Okt. 2015.

He is also the founder of Rukus Avenue, a South Asian record label based in Los Angeles, CA. Career Sammy has transformed both the musical landscape and the South Asian community with a storied career spanning over two decades. In 1996, he laid the foundation for Rukus Avenue, as an independent record label and platform for an emerging scene of South Asian musicians in North America. This seminal company was at the forefront of a community-driven movement to establish a new identity for South-Asian Americans, that were charged with the task of reconciling traditional cultural values with American ones. Chand had made a name for himself in the world of film and television through a lengthy list of placements. Under his leadership, the label gained an international presence, beginning with a landmark distribution deal with Sony Music in India and a more recent global agreement with The Orchard. Early releases such as Passage to India (Various, 2001) and The Movement (Karmacy, 2005), helped to cement Chand's status as dynamic music producer and cultural ambassador. His solo debut, Tale of a Crown (2010) further demonstrates his ability to pair original musical elements found in South Asian music with a variety of other genres - a Chand signature. Throughout his career, Chand and his music have built a formidable bond with the film and television community. His notable placements include CBS News, PBS, The Oprah Winfrey Show, America's Most Wanted, Leela, So You Think You Can Dance?, Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations and the Weather Channel's Storm Riders. In 2008, he partnered with the Indian Film Festival of Los Angeles to bring a live musical component to the festival that would properly articulate the intimate relationship between music and film in Indian Cinema. The IFFLA Rhythm Village and IFFLA Rhythm Village Unplugged under his direction, have become highly popular additions to the annual festival. Today, Chand is further advancing this movement and his sound with the third generation of Rukus Avenue artists. He is currently producing the debut from Elephants With Guns, an eclectic band that, “collects music, sounds and noises from different parts of the world, wraps them in twine, and presents them to you.” He is also currently writing and recording material for Blood and Treasure, the follow-up to Tale of a Crown.

The treaty was the first among several concluded between the Dutch and the peoples of the Gold Coast, and marked the beginning of a 260-year period of Dutch presence on the Gold Coast. History Although no copy of the treaty survived, it likely allowed for the establishment of Fort Nassau near Mouri. The story goes that the king of Asebu sent two envoys by the names of Carvalho and Marinho to the Dutch Republic to confirm the treaty. The fact that both men had Portuguese names suspects that they were local Christian African-Portuguese mulattos. Evidence for this early African embassy to the Dutch Republic is only circumstantial, however. No hard proof exists of these men visiting Europe. The conclusion of this treaty should be seen in the light of the Twelve Years' Truce (1609-1621) between Portugal-Spain and the Dutch Republic. Under the terms of the treaty, the Dutch were forbidden to trade in areas occupied by either Spain or Portugal. The Portuguese claimed the entire Gold Coast as theirs; by concluding this treaty, the Dutch, who had been trading on the Gold Coast since the 1590s, laid their claim on a part of the coast as well.

Mantrips usually take the form of a train, running on a mine railway and operating like a cable car. Mantrips may also be self-powered, for example by a diesel locomotive. Other types of mantrips do not require a track and take the form of a pickup truck running on rubber tires. Because many mines have low ceilings, mantrips tend to have a reduced height.

Starlet explores the unlikely friendship between 21-year-old Jane and 85-year-old Sadie, two women whose lives intersect in California's San Fernando Valley. Plot Jane, who also introduces herself as Tess, is a young woman who lives in an apartment with two dysfunctional roommates, Melissa, and Melissa's boyfriend Mikey, and her Chihuahua dog Starlet. Jane decides she wants to personalize her room, but Melissa says the room cannot be painted because Mikey needs it for \\"shoots\\". Jane decides to buy new furniture at neighborhood yard sales. At one such sale she comes across an old woman named Sadie, from whom she buys a thermos. While Melissa and Mikey argue downstairs, she discovers a stash of money in the thermos. She spends some of the money on extravagant luxuries, but then decides to return the money to Sadie. Sadie, however, dismisses Jane before she can explain. Sadie takes a cab to the grocery store; Jane follows, pays and sends away the cab, and offers Sadie a ride home. The two women spend time together in Sadie's house; Jane gives her number to a skeptical Sadie and tells her to call her if she needs anything. Jane later surprises Sadie by joining her at a bingo game. Once more paying off Sadie's taxi, she drives her home and asks her about whether she wins at bingo. Sadie responds by spraying Jane with mace. After a talk with the police, Jane leaves visibly angry. Sadie calls Jane the next day to reconcile; the two spend some time together and Jane learns that Sadie, a widow, loves Paris but has never visited the city. Melissa is fired from her job where the pair are adult film stars. Jane convinces their boss to suspend Melissa for a month instead, and Jane consequently gets a promotion. While Jane is at work, she leaves Starlet with Sadie, who loses the dog while tending to her garden. Sadie recovers the dog after a desperate and exhausting search. When Jane arrives to retrieve Starlet, Sadie seems troubled and wants to put an end to their friendship, which upsets Jane. Melissa, advises Jane to spend the money on someone she cares about, so Jane buys two first-class tickets to Paris for Sadie and herself. Sadie, however, refuses to go. Jane buys 25 Bingo cards and makes a deal with Sadie that if she wins at bingo, Sadie will go on the trip. Jane loses because Sadie herself wins the game; Sadie ultimately agrees to go on the trip anyway. Back at the apartment, Melissa finds out that Jane has spent all the money on Sadie instead of her. The two engage in a screaming match, and Melissa kicks Jane out and later tells Sadie about the stash of money. Sadie briefly unpacks her suitcase, but then rethinks her action. Later, Jane, ignorant of Sadie's knowledge about the money, picks her up to go to the airport. Sadie asks Jane to stop at the cemetery to leave flowers on the grave of her husband, and Jane notices the nearby grave of Sadie's deceased daughter. She then returns to the car, and they drive away.

Applicators are usually metal bars that are manufactured to high tolerances to give consistent, repeatable results. Each bar will give a \\"theoretical wet film thickness\\" or, in other words, the thickness of the coating that should remain on the drawdown card after application. Even with high manufacturing tolerances, the actual wet film thickness can vary from 50% to 90% of the gap. There are multiple types of bar applicators, their forms and uses are shown below. Film applicators follow the ASTM standard D823.ASTM D823 - 95(2007) Standard Practices for Producing Films of Uniform Thickness of Paint, Varnish, and Related Products on Test Panels Applicators can be used either manually or automatically. Manual film applicator When using an applicator manually, small variations in speed and applied pressure are inevitable. These variations can affect the quality of the drawdown and thus the measurements of film properties such as abrasion resistance, hiding power and gloss. Automatic film applicator The use of an automatic film applicator guarantees consistent speed and pressure, providing repeatable and high quality results. Automatic film applicators vary in their construction. The most modern types of applicators use vacuum plates to hold the drawdown cards and allow a variety of application bars to be mounted. The speed and pressure of the bar can be adjusted to allow for customization of the final film thickness. The drawdown process is governed by ASTM standard D823. Types =Four-sided applicator= Used for high viscous coatings, this type of applicator has four different clearances built in, one on each horizontal surface. =Applicator frame= Used for low viscous coatings, this applicator also has four different clearances built in. It is used for non-rigid substances and has a two sided opening in the center of the bar. =Bar type or Bird applicator= This applicator has one, two or four clearances and contains a slanted trailing edge, also used for high viscous coatings. This is the most common type of film applicator. Gap This is a wire wound bar at each end, the gap height is controlled by the wire diameter, very simple and very cost effective. =U shaped= This applicator also has two clearances but features a U-shaped form instead of a straight bar. =Square applicator or Octoplex applicator= The square applicator is the more versatile than previously mentioned applicators. It has 8 clearances in the form of a square frame. This tool combines the accuracy of fixed applicators with the versatility of adjustable applicators. =Film applicator knife= This adjustable applicator has a metal frame with an adjustable \\"knife\\" that acts as the gap clearance. These applicators are the most versatile manual applicator, but is also the least precise. =Wire-wound applicator= These applicators differ from the bar applicators as they consist of a metal rod wound with wire of varying thickness. The coating will pass through the gaps between the wires and level off at a uniform thickness. There are two main types of wire bars. Close wire wound bars will produce coating layers from 4 to 120μm. Higher coating thickness up to 500μm can be obtained using open wound bars. Testing A standard procedure for testing substances that are applied in a liquid form, and then dry to a solid film, is to create a controlled, standardized test film of the substance, usually on a standardized substrate, such as a metal, plastic or paper panel.

On September 28, 2016, the game was officially shut down by Z2Live, along with many of their other titles. Gameplay The game puts players in control of land with limited resources where effective management of resources is vital to expansion and advancement. Building a productive nation allows players to form armies which are the basis for the game's core: PvP combat in turn-based strategy warfare. It is impossible to \\"lose\\" in Battle Nations: even if the player has no buildings to generate gold, the player will always have enough gold to build a supply drop, which generates 100 gold every hour as well as 25 of iron, wood, and stone. Most of the technology in game is based on that used by humans during WW2, although there are a few exceptions (e.g. velociraptors, mammoths, lasers, swords, plasma, railguns, etc.). There are 3 major aspects to the gameplay: Battling, Building, and Storyline. = Battling = Depending on the type of battle, this could mean a 9-block plot (arranged 3x3) or a 13-block plot (first and second row have 5, third row has 3). One unit fits into each plot, however there is a limit on how many units can be used for each battle. The battle is turn-based where the player selects a unit, an attack from the unit, and the targeted block (or, depending on the type of attack, the enemy unit). After the attack is played out, the enemy responds with an attack. The player may also forfeit their turn by clicking the \\"Pass\\" button, or the player can withdraw from the battle by clicking the white sign icon at the top-left corner. = Building = The player's base, called their \\"Outpost\\", is their main way of collecting primary resources (by building Iron Mines, Coal Quarries, Oil Pumps, and Wood Loggers) and secondary resources (Steel is made by a Steel Mill with Iron and Coal, Lumber is by a Lumber mill made with Wood). Other important buildings include warehouses (small, medium, large, high-capacity), Barracks (used to train most troops), Hospitals, Vehicle Factories, and Vehicle Repair Bays. All of the previously mentioned buildings have premium versions which can be purchased using Nanopods. Initially, only a small portion of the map is unlocked. The player must then buy land expansions to gain access to more land. The land expansions progressively get more expensive as well as take longer to complete. All construction times for buildings as well as land expansions can be sped up with the use of Nanopods. = Storyline = Battle Nations also has a few major storylines as well as many smaller storylines (most of which were for limited edition events). Some major plot points include defeating Warlord Gantas (the antagonist boss of the Raiders), Attacking Rebel Forces (after they successfully take down the Imperial Forces), and confronting the Sovereign Navy (mainly by boats). The characters that routinely assist in this plot include Lieutenant Morgan (who loves to drink whiskey), Sergeant Ramsey, Perkins, Dr. Aurora, and many more. Nanopods Nanopods are a rare resource in Battle Nations. With it, the user can buy units, buildings, speed up units and building formation, research new unit attacks, and finally buy resources the user lacks. The user can win them by leveling up (10 free nanopods granted to the player each level), buying them with real money, watching advertisements or achieving a specific rank in events (Boss Strikes or Arena Challenges). Units and buildings that require nanopods tend to be better than the ones requiring normal resources instead, but this is not always true. Promotional units, more powerful specialty units that are only available to purchase for a limited amount of time, all require nanopods to be acquired, increasing the value of nanopods. In the last week before Battle Nations was shut down 1,000,000 Nanopods were added to every Battle Nations account and many previously retired promotional units became available to players for purchase. Development Battle Nations is Z2Live's third game, following Trade Nations and MetalStorm. Z2Live released a video that described the inspiration behind the creation of Battle Nations. The concept for the game was inspired by Trade Nations users who provided feedback requesting additional PvP elements in the game. Mid-Years & Events Battle Nations grew quickly, and the playerbase became loyal and dedicated to the game. 'The Boss Strike', in which allies in guilds joined together to get the highest score possible, and in turn receive special unit and resource rewards. FotS was acknowledged by the Battle Nations community to be the victors of the final Boss Strike, much to the chagrin of BSR. 'Invasions' also presented opportunities for guild members to work together and compete against other guilds by defeating enemy invasions on their outposts. 'Arena Challenges', although controversial and 'pay-to-win', allowed players to square up against other players in Asynchronous player-versus-player combat. With every event, a 'promotional unit' was released. These units were purchasable by Nanopods, and in some cases, had incredible advantages over non-promotional units. This led to the firm conviction by many of the players that the game was 'free-to-play, pay-to-win'. Some of these more 'overpowered' promotional units assisted in the eventual demise of the game. Final Days In February 2015 it was announced that King had purchased Z2 Live Inc, for $150M.http://www.geekwire.com/2015/candy-crush-maker-king-buys-seattle-mobile- gaming-company-z2-150-million/ Subsequently, Battle Nations was pulled from the Steam platform as of 16 April 2015. During this time, the game developers released less and less updates and events, and the quality of any updates, according to players, decreased as well. On July 17, 2015, the game developers released the last update, focused on a new world boss and 2 eventual boss- strikes, along with some additional units.http://www.bnoutpost.com/ On June 28, 2016, Z2 had announced a close, and have pulled any Z2–related game off the appstore, and any online service has now officially shut down as of September 28, 2016. After Shutdown Over the course of the next few years, \\"inspired\\" spinoffs as well as a direct fan recreation that is currently in an alpha build and will be released without micro transactions.https://vk.com/frontierchronicleshttps://trello.com/b/OERiWuE0/battle- nations- rewrittenhttps://m.facebook.com/login.php?next=https%3A%2F%2Fm.facebook.com%2FNationsofwar-194728601249584%2F&refsrc;=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2FNationsOfWar%2F&_rdr However, anything proposed has yet to be released.

Eliane wants it as a memorial of Alexander, who took his life about a year before. She provides pictures and videos of him for the painter. She wants Lilli to sit for a double portrait, but she is disgusted by the idea to have her dead brother on the wall \\"for decoration\\". Unlike her mother, she is not disciplined and loses her leading role at the Theatre Academy because of disputes with her teacher. She tries unsuccessfully to find closeness and intimacy in her relationship with the artist Aldo. At the sessions with Max, Lilli is reserved at first whereas he seeks to look behind her facade and capture her character in the painting. He recognizes the profound relationship between the siblings and understands Lilli's realm of feelings better and better. Thereby he also is able to connect to the personal losses in his own history. The relationship between painter and model deepens, and they trust each other more and more. The resulting portrait does not meet Eliane's expectations, but breaks her reservations regarding Lilly. She is able to begin to cope with the death of her son. Lilly accepts that she will not figure out the reason of her brother's suicide, and is then able to forgive him. Themes The film deals with the processing of a family catastrophy and the grief it causes. The story does not aim to resolve the mystery of the suicide, but concentrates on the development of Lilly, a process triggered by the painter. It does not show the typical affair between an artist and his model, but \\"eine behutsam in Halbschritten der Zuneigung erzählte Geschichte von tröstlicher Nähe, die beiden guttut\\" (\\"gently told, a history of half-steps of affection, of a comforting closeness that is good for both). The completed portrat captures the past, but on the other hands points to a future for which Lilly is ready now. Awards Caroline Herfurth was awarded with the Bavarian Film Award for \\"Beste Nachwuchsschauspielerin\\" (best upcoming actress), and the Preis der deutschen Filmkritik. The film was nominated for the Deutscher Filmpreis in the categories Bester Spielfilm (best feature), Bester Hauptdarsteller (best main actor) and Bester Schnitt (best editing). Film composer Niki Reiser was awarded the prize. References Further reading * Review by a prolific web film critic.

History of study  Acanthostomatops was originally named for the type species, Acanthostoma vorax, in 1883. However, the genus name Acanthostoma was previously used for a polychaete worm back in 1813, and the present name was given in 1961. Detailed descriptions of the taxon were given by Steen & Brough (1937), with an emphasis on the ontogeny of the taxon based on the large sample size given by Boy (1989) and Witzmann & Schoch (2006). Werneburg (1998) described a larval specimen of A. vorax, but this was later proven to be a specimen of the micromelerpetid Branchierpeton amblystomum.  Anatomy  Acanthostomatops is diagnosed by six features: (1) lacrimal and prefrontal projecting into orbital; (2) quadratojugal with two lateral spikes; (3) choana laterally constricted by palatal tusk sockets; (4) small, rectangular interclavicle; (5) large and robust humerus present in larval stages; (6) 21-22 presacral vertebrae positions. Compared to the other zatracheidids, it has the proportionately widest skull and the smallest internarial fontanelle, which only slightly divides the nasals. it also lacks posteriorly extensive tabular horns and postparietal horns. It is also the only zatracheidid with definitively known postcranial material.  Development  Over 30 specimens of A. vorax are known from the type locality near Dresden. The ontogenetic changes have been described in detail most recently by Witzmann & Schoch (2006). Among the changes that occur are a proportional shortening of the femur and the trunk relative to the skull and a distinct remodeling of the hyobranchial apparatus, with resorption of the larval form's ceratobranchials and the formation of a complex apparatus of hypobranchials that the authors suggested was for supporting the tongue. Based on the changes to the skeleton and the distribution of size classes within the locality, Witzmann & Schoch (2006) suggested that A. vorax had a biphasic life history, with an aquatic larval to juvenile form and a terrestrial adult form.

She served as a submarine chaser (U-Jäger) under Otto Pollmann, Germany’s most decorated anti-submarine warfare officer. Uj-2210 was sunk in the Mediterranean in May 1944. Early history Uj-2210 was built as the French trawler Marcella in 1933 at the ACL/CAP shipyards at St Nazaire. With a Gross Register Tonnage of 1152 tons she was an ocean-going trawler and was employed in France’s deep sea fishery. The outbreak of the Second World War and the Fall of France found Marcella in the Mediterranean, where she remained until 1942. Service history In November 1942 Germany invaded Vichy France, and Marcella was seized by the Kriegsmarine for conversion as an anti-submarine naval trawler. On completion she was commissioned by Lt. Otto Pollmann and in the 15 months under his command, claimed 14 Allied submarines destroyed, although only one of these, () can be substantiated. Pollmann was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for his efforts. Pollmann and Uj-2210 were credited with the sinking of HMS Tigris in a post-war evaluation. On 27 February 1943 Uj-2210 was escorting a convoy south east of Capri and made an attack on a submarine contact. This produced signs of a successful attack (oil and an air bubble): Tigris failed to return to base on 6 March and Uj-2210’s contact and attack was deemed the most likely to have been responsible for her loss. Following Pollmann’s promotion and departure, Uj-2210 continued anti-submarine activities, but with no further success reported. Fate On 28 May 1944, while in the Ligurian Sea, Uj-2210 was spotted and attacked by American motor-torpedo-boats. She was hit by a torpedo and sank off Deiva Marina, breaking in two. Wreck The wreck of Uj-2210 lies at a depth of and is a popular (though dangerous) wreck site for sport divers. The stern is resting on the sea bottom, while the stem of the ship is standing vertical, rising from the sea bottom. However the wreck is in a fishing ground and is surrounded by discarded fishing nets, making any approach hazardous, while the depth requires specialized breathing arrangements.

According to a 2014 study by Nature and a 2016 article in Times Higher Education, it is the largest academic social network in terms of active users, although other services have more registered users, and a 2015–2016 survey suggests that almost as many academics have Google Scholar profiles. While reading articles does not require registration, people who wish to become site members need to have an email address at a recognized institution or to be manually confirmed as a published researcher in order to sign up for an account. Members of the site each have a user profile and can upload research output including papers, data, chapters, negative results, patents, research proposals, methods, presentations, and software source code. Users may also follow the activities of other users and engage in discussions with them. Users are also able to block interactions with other users. The site has been criticized for sending unsolicited email invitations to coauthors of the articles listed on the site that were written to appear as if the email messages were sent by the other coauthors of the articles (a practice the site said it had discontinued as of November 2016) and for automatically generating apparent profiles for non-users who have sometimes felt misrepresented by them. A study found that over half of the uploaded papers appear to infringe copyright, because the authors uploaded the publisher's version. Features The New York Times described the site as a mashup of Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. Site members may \\"follow\\" a research interest, in addition to following other individual members. It has a blogging feature for users to write short reviews on peer-reviewed articles. ResearchGate indexes self- published information on user profiles to suggest members to connect with others who have similar interests. When a member posts a question, it is fielded to others that have identified on their user profile that they have a relevant expertise. It also has private chat rooms where users can share data, edit shared documents, or discuss confidential topics. The site also features a research-focused job board. , it has more than 15 million users, with its largest user-bases coming from Europe and North America. Most of ResearchGate's users are involved in medicine or biology, though it also has participants from engineering, computer science, agricultural sciences, and psychology, among others. ResearchGate publishes an author-level metric in the form of an \\"RG Score\\". RG score is not a citation impact measure. RG Scores have been reported to be correlated with existing author-level metrics, but have also been criticized as having questionable reliability and an unknown calculation methodology. ResearchGate does not charge fees for putting content on the site and does not require peer review. History ResearchGate was founded in 2008 by virologist Dr. Ijad Madisch, who remains the company's CEO, with physician Dr. Sören Hofmayer, and computer scientist Horst Fickenscher. It started in Boston, Massachusetts, and moved to Berlin, Germany, shortly afterwards. The company's first round of funding, in 2010, was led by the venture capital firm Benchmark. Benchmark partner Matt Cohler became a member of the board and participated in the decision to move to Berlin. According to The New York Times, the website began with few features, then was developed further based on input from scientists. From 2009 to 2011, the number of users of the site grew from 25,000 to more than 1 million. A second round of funding led by Peter Thiel's Founders Fund was announced in February 2012. On June 4, 2013, it closed Series C financing arrangements for $35M from investors including Bill Gates. The company grew from 12 employees in 2011 to 120 in 2014. It currently has about 300 employees, including a sales staff of 100. ResearchGate's competitors include Academia.edu, Google Scholar and Mendeley. In 2016 Academia.edu reportedly had more registered users (about 34 million versus 11 million) and higher web traffic, but ResearchGate was substantially larger in terms of active usage by researchers. The fact that ResearchGate restricts its user accounts to people at recognized institutions and published researchers may explain the disparity in active usage, as a high percentage of the accounts on Academia.edu are lapsed or inactive. In a 2015-2016 survey of academic profile tools, about as many respondents have ResearchGate profiles and Google Scholar profiles, but almost twice as many respondents use Google Scholar for search than use ResearchGate for accessing publications.Innovations in Scholarly Communication. 2016. Universiteit Utrecht, accessed 2016-12-02. . Madisch has said the company's business strategy is focused on highly targeted advertising based on analysis of the activities of users, saying \\"Imagine you could click on a microscope mentioned in a paper and buy it\\", and estimating the spending on science at $1 trillion per year under the control of a \\"relatively small number of people\\". In November 2015 they acquired additional funding of $52.6 million from a range of investors including Goldman Sachs, Benchmark Capital, Wellcome Trust and Bill Gates, but did not announce this until February 2017. Losses increased from €5.4m in 2014 to €6.2m in 2015, but ResearchGate's CEO expressed optimism that they would break even eventually. Reception A 2009 article in BusinessWeek reported that ResearchGate was a \\"potentially powerful link\\" in promoting innovation in developing countries by connecting scientists from those nations with their peers in industrialized nations. It said the website had become popular largely due to its ease of use. It also said that ResearchGate had been involved in several notable cross-country collaborations between scientists that led to substantive developments. Academic reception of ResearchGate remains generally positive, as recent reviews of extant literature show an accepting audience with broad coverage of concepts. A 2012 paper published in The International Information & Library Review conducted a survey with 160 respondents and reported that out of those respondents using social networking \\"for academic purposes\\", Facebook and ResearchGate were the most popular at the University of Delhi, but also \\"a majority of respondents said using SNSs [Social Networking Sites] may be a waste of time\\". Although ResearchGate is used internationally, its uptake—as of 2014—is uneven, with Brazil having particularly many users and China having few when compared to the number of publishing researchers. In a 2014 study by Nature, 88 percent of the responding scientists and engineers said that they were aware of ResearchGate and would use it when \\"contacted\\", but less than 10% said they would use it to actively discuss research with 40% instead preferring to use Twitter when discussing research. ResearchGate was visited regularly by half of those surveyed by Nature, coming second to Google Scholar. 29 percent of regular visitors had signed up for a profile on ResearchGate in the past year, and 35% of the survey participants were invited by email. A 2016 article in Times Higher Education reported that in a global survey of 20,670 people who use academic social networking sites, ResearchGate was the dominant network and was twice as popular as others: 61 percent of respondents who had published at least one paper had a ResearchGate profile. Another study reported that \\"relatively few academics appear to post questions and answers\\", but instead use it only as an \\"online CV\\". In the context of the big deal cancellations by several library systems in the world, the wide usage of ResearchGate was credited as one of the factors which reduced the apparent value of the subscriptions to toll access resources. Data analysis tools like Unpaywall Journals, used by libraries to calculate the real costs and value of their options before such decisions, allow to separate ResearchGate from open archives like institutional repositories, which are considered more stable. Controversy ResearchGate had been criticized by many users for its decision to not remove convicted sex offenders from its social networking site. Many researchers deleted their account in protest as they refused to remove convicted child pornographer and registered sex offender in Canada, Ben Levin as a user. Identified on ResearchGate as “Research Ben”, he had been a frequent user of ResearchGate, publishing over 80 papers of interest with the vast majority dealing with studies around child pornography and pedophiles. Criticism ResearchGate has been criticized for emailing unsolicited invitations to the coauthors of its users. These emails were written as if they were personally sent by the user, but were instead sent automatically unless the user opted out, which caused some researchers to boycott the service Quote 1: ResearchGate is certainly well-known [...] More than 88% of scientists and engineers said that they were aware of it. Quote 2: \\"They do send you a lot of spam,\\" Billie Swalla] says Quote 3: [...] regularly sending out automated e-mails that profess to come from colleagues active on the site Quote 4: \\"I think it is a disgraceful kind of marketing and I am choosing not to use their service because of that\\", [Lars Arvestad] says Quote 5: \\"I've met basically no academics in my field with a favourable view of ResearchGate\\", says Daniel MacArthur Quote 6: Some of the apparent profiles on the site are not owned by real people, but are created automatically – and incompletely – by scraping details of people's affiliations, publication records and PDFs Quote 7: That annoys researchers who do not want to be on the site, and who feel that the pages misrepresent them – especially when they discover that ResearchGate will not take down the pages when asked. Quote 8: [Madisch] will not say how many of [the papers available on ResearchGate] have been automatically scraped from freely accessible places elsewhere. and contributes to the negative view of ResearchGate in the scientific community. As of November 2016,ResearchGate, Page change for page \\"Inviting colleagues to ResearchGate\\". ResearchGate official website. 10 November 2016. Retrieved 2017-10-08. the site appears to have discontinued this practice. The TechCrunch moderator Mike Butcher accused ResearchGate of having scraped competitors' websites for email addresses to spam, which the ResearchGate CEO denied. A study published by the Association for Information Systems in 2014 found that a dormant account on ResearchGate, using default settings, generated 297 invitations to 38 people over a 16-month period, and that the user profile was automatically attributed to more than 430 publications. Furthermore, journalists and researchers found that the RG score, calculated by ResearchGate via a proprietary algorithm, can reach high values under questionable circumstances. Several studies have looked at the RG score, for which details about how it is calculated are not published. These studies concluded that the RG score was \\"intransparent and irreproducible\\",Kraker, P., & Lex, E. A Critical Look at the ResearchGate Score as a Measure of Scientific Reputation. Quantifying and Analysing Scholarly Communication on the Web (ASCW'15) criticized the way it incorporates the journal impact factor into the user score, and suggested that it should \\"not be considered in the evaluation of academics\\". The results were confirmed in a second \\"response\\" study, which also found the score to depend mostly on journal impact factors. The RG score was found to be negatively correlated with network centrality, i.e., that users that are the most active (and thus central to the network) on ResearchGate usually do not have high RG scores. It was also found to be strongly positively correlated with Quacquarelli Symonds university rankings at the institutional level, but only weakly with Elsevier SciVal rankings of individual authors. While it was found to be correlated with different university rankings, the correlation in between these rankings themselves was higher. Nature also reported that \\"Some of the apparent profiles on the site are not owned by real people, but are created automatically – and incompletely – by scraping details of people's affiliations, publication records and PDFs, if available, from around the web. That annoys researchers who do not want to be on the site, and who feel that the pages misrepresent them – especially when they discover that ResearchGate will not take down the pages when asked.\\" ResearchGate uses a crawler to find PDF versions of articles on the homepages of authors and publishers. These are then presented as if they had been uploaded to the web site by the author: the PDF will be displayed embedded in a frame, and only the button label \\"External Download\\" indicates that the file was in fact not uploaded to ResearchGate. ResearchGate has also been criticized for failing to provide safeguards against \\"the dark side of academic writing\\", including such phenomena as fake publishers, \\"ghost journals\\", publishers with \\"predatory\\" publication fees, and fake impact ratings. It has also been criticized for copyright infringement of published works. In September 2017, lawyers representing the International Association of Scientific, Technical, and Medical Publishers (STM) sent a letter to ResearchGate threatening legal action against them for copyright infringement and demanding them to alter their handling of uploaded articles to include pre-release checking for copyright violations and \\"Specifically, [for ResearchGate to] end its extraction of content from hosted articles and the modification of any hosted content, including any and all metadata. It would also mean an end to Researchgate's own copying and downloading of published journal article content and the creation of internal databases of articles.\\" This was followed by an announcement that takedown requests are to be issued to ResearchGate for copyright infringement relating to millions of articles. A statement supporting the action was issued by a group called Coalition for Responsible Sharing, and the statement was signed by the American Chemical Society, Brill Publishers, Elsevier, Wiley, and Wolters Kluwer. Subsequently, Coalition for Responsible Sharing (CfRS) reported that \\"ResearchGate has removed from public view a significant number of copyrighted articles it is hosting on its site\\". CfRS also confirmed that \\"not all violations have been addressed\\" and as such, takedown notices have been issued. ResearchGate has managed to achieve an agreement on article uploading with three other major publishers, Springer Nature, Cambridge University Press and Thieme. Under the agreement, the publishers will be notified when their articles are uploaded but will not be able to premoderate uploads.  References  External links ACS v.

Produced by Rick Rubin, each release contains two songs featuring an a-side and a b-side and they are available worldwide through 7\\" vinyl and digital download. The singles were also released as a double LP vinyl set, entitled I'm Beside You, in November 2013 and was sold exclusively on Record Store Day. Background During a Q&A; on May 5, 2012, Chad Smith announced through his Twitter page that the album's unreleased songs would eventually see the light of day. On May 27, 2012, Smith said in response to a tweet that, at some point in the next six months, the band would be releasing ten unreleased songs on 7-inch and as digital downloads. Flea followed up Smith's announcement a few days later on May 29, 2012 by stating that eighteen unreleased songs from the I'm with You sessions would be released over the next six months. He also confirmed that the band has been writing new music while touring. Josh Klinghoffer commented on the unreleased songs by saying \\"Finding songs that seem to want to join hands with others is a special task that require the right people...and the right songs! Some songs seem to have a lot more of an agenda than others. Some songs play well with others and some songs need more attention and a little extra care. Here are some songs that seemed to want to pair up and take a later train. Keep your eye on them, they're up to something...\\" Smith said in July 2012 of the unreleased songs that \\"We just wanted them to come out because we just really like them. We didn't want them to get lost, so we're gonna put them out, mainly for our fans. They would've waited for the Warner Bros. box set in, like, 2020, if there's even a record company around then. I'm glad they're going to see the light of day because it's an important part of the band and what we were doing at the time.\\" On the sound of the songs, Smith says he finds it \\"hard to explain\\" what the first two songs to be released sound like but describes \\"Long Progression\\" as \\"kind of a flowing, kind of midtempo funk\\". He also stated the band is currently working on new music. \\"Those are just waiting,\\" Smith said. \\"We'll go back to those when we start writing again, I'm sure – or not. We're just always trying to come up with new stuff; usually the latest and greatest is what we use, but you never know.\\" Writing and composition All of the seventeen songs were recorded during the sessions for I'm with You. \\"Long Progression\\", the b-side to \\"Strange Man\\" which was the first single released, almost made the album's final cut but was left off in favor of \\"Goodbye Hooray\\". One of the songs, \\"In Love, Dying\\" is an eight-minute rocker captured in a single studio take that occupies both sides of a single, as Klinghoffer told Rolling Stone from a recent tour stop in Berne, Switzerland. “We’re going to have to do that old trick where it fades out and fades back in on the B-side.” Another cut, “Victorian Machinery” “sounds like a big three- headed monster playing drums,” Klinghoffer said, adding that the band captured “absolute magic” with “Never Is a Long Time,” a “pop-tastic” number featuring Greg Kurstin on piano. “It’s really one of those cases where they had too many good songs to fit on an album. They have this cohesive thing in the studio – when they get that take, that’s the take that they keep.” “It’s always difficult, but we use a democratic process and the songs with the most votes are usually the backbone of the album,” producer Rick Rubin wrote in an email. “I can just say as is always the case, some of my personal favorites don’t make the cut. I’m sure everyone in the band can tell you the same.” In an interview, Klinghoffer said the band spent time in 2012 and 2013 doing post- session work for some of the b-sides.https://sites.google.com/site/rhcpsessions/i-m-with-you Klinghoffer also said they recorded 48 songs during the album's sessions and some could eventually see the light of day. “It’s possible,” Klinghoffer said. “We just had so much material back then that certain things just straight-up didn’t get enough attention. There’s a couple that will probably just remain in our iPods.” Artwork Each of the nine seven-inches feature cover artwork by Kelsey Brookes, and when combined together, form one larger piece of artwork. The artwork is titled \\"Iris\\" and featured in Brookes' new \\"Meditations on Symmetry\\" series which was displayed from March 2012 at Compound Project in Malibu, California. Brookes' well-documented background in microbiology, surf culture and folk art combine in explosive prisms of raucous color, bold imagery and timeless motifs. His work has appeared in countless group shows, art fairs, and magazines such as GQ, Modern Painters, Juxtapoz, Beautiful Decay and Dazed & Confused. However, the artwork was sightly modified for the single's release, by rotating the image 45 degrees.

His Guantanamo Internment Serial Number was 679. American intelligence analysts estimate he was born in 1980, in Ib, Yemen. He was the younger brother of Ali Abdullah Ahmed, one of the three Guantanamo detainees who died in custody on June 10, 2006. He was repatriated on December 19, 2009. NBC News reported, on March 3, 2017, that he was killed by a missile launched from a surveillance drone on March 2, 2017. Background Taher was apprehended by a mixed force of Pakistani and American counter-terrorism officials in March 2002. He was captured in an off-campus residence provided for students of Salafi University in Faisalabad, Pakistan together with a dozen other foreign students. He claimed he was just a student at Salafi University, and had no ties to terrorism. He faced the allegations that his photo was identified as someone who had been seen by an al Qaida member in Afghanistan, and that he had received a recruitment letter from the Taliban. Historian Andy Worthington, author of The Guantanamo Files, identified Tahar as an individual who informed the officers on his Combatant Status Review Tribunal that he had been informed, early in his detention, that he had been apprehended in error, and would soon be released.

In response to a court order the Department of Defense was forced to comply with a Freedom of Information Act request and publish a sixteen page summarized transcript from Tahar's Tribunal. Tahar chose to participate in his Administrative Review Board hearing. In response to a court order the Department of Defense responded to a Freedom of Information Act request and published a twelve page summarized transcript from his first annual Review Board in the spring of 2006. On January 9, 2009, the Department of Defense released two heavily redacted memos, from his 2007 Administrative Review Board, to Gordon England, the Designated Civilian Official. =Habeas petition= A petition of habeas corpus was filed on his behalf Over two hundred captives had habeas corpus petitions filed on their behalf before the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 and the Military Commissions Act of 2006 closed off the captives' access to the US civilian justice system. On June 12, 2008, in its ruling on the Boumediene v. Bush habeas corpus petition, the United States Supreme Court over-rode the Congress and Presidency, and restored the captives' access to habeas corpus. On July 18, 2008, Pardiss Kebriaei filed a \\"Petitioner's status report\\" on Mohammed Ahmed Taher's behalf in Civil Action No. 06-cv-1684. Mohammad Ahmad Taher had a DTA appeal filed on his behalf. The United States Congress passed the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 and the Military Commissions Act of 2006. Both these Acts included provisions to close of Guantanamo captives' ability to file habeas corpus petitions. The Detainee Treatment Act included a provision to proscribe Guantanamo captives who had not already initiated a habeas corpus petition from initiating new habeas corpus petitions. The Act included provision for an alternate, more limited form of appeal for captives. Captives were allowed to submit limited appeals to panels of three judges in a Washington DC appeals court. The appeals were limited—they could not be based on general principles of human rights. They could only be based on arguments that their Combatant Status Review Tribunal had not followed the rules laid out for the operation of Combatant Status Review Tribunals. Nine months later Congress passed the Military Commissions Act. This Act contained provision to close off all the remaining outstanding habeas corpus petitions. After the closure of the habeas corpus petitions some Guantanamo captives had appeals in the Washington DC court submitted on their behalf, as described in the Detainee Treatment Act. The DTA appeals progressed very slowly. Initially the Department of Justice argued that the captive's lawyers, and the judges on the panel, needed consider no more evidence than the \\"Summary of Evidence memos\\" prepared for the captives' CSR Tribunals. By September 2007, the Washington DC court ruled that the evidence that formed the basis of the summaries had to be made available. The Administration then argued that it was not possible to present the evidence the Tribunals considered in 2004—because the evidence had not been preserved. Only one captive, a Uyghur captive named Hufaiza Parhat, had his DTA appeal run to completion. On June 20, 2008, his three judge panel concluded that his Tribunal had erred and that he never should have been confirmed as an enemy combatant. =Formerly secret Joint Task Force Guantanamo assessment= On April 25, 2011, whistleblower organization WikiLeaks published formerly secret assessments drafted by Joint Task Force Guantanamo analysts. His Joint Task Force Guantanamo assessment was drafted on March 20, 2008. It was signed by camp commandant Rear Admiral Mark H. Buzby. He recommended continued detention. Charlie Savage noted that Tahar's assessment said Guantanamo authorities had intercepted a letter he wrote to his family depicting his brother as a martyr. Following reports of his killing Associated Press reporter Lolita C. Baldor quoted extensively from the assessment's description as to why Tahar would represent a risk, if released. Press reports Canadian journalist, and former special assistant to US President George W. Bush, David Frum, published an article based on his own reading of the transcripts from the Combatant Status Review Tribunals, on November 11, 2006. It was Frum who coined the term \\"Axis of evil\\" for use in a speech he wrote for Bush. Tahar's transcript was one of the nine Frum briefly summarized. His comment on Tahar was: Frum came to the conclusion that all nine of the men whose transcript he summarized had obviously lied. He did not, however, state how he came to the conclusion they lied. His article concluded with the comment: Repatriation Carol Rosenberg, writing in the Miami Herald reported that Muhammaed Yasir Ahmed Taher was one of twelve men transferred from Guantanamo on December 19, 2009. The other eleven men were: Ayman Batarfi, Jamal Alawi Mari, Farouq Ali Ahmed, Fayad Yahya Ahmed al Rami, Riyad Atiq Ali Abdu al Haf, Abdul Hafiz, Sharifullah, Mohamed Rahim, Mohammed Hashim, Ismael Arale and Mohamed Suleiman Barre. Abdul Hafiz, Sharifullah, Mohamed Rahim and Mohammed Hashim were Afghans. Asmael Arale and Mohamed Suleiman Barre were Somalis. The other five men were fellow Yemenis. Death He was killed by a missile launched from a surveillance drone on March 2, 2017. Lucas Tomlinson, of Fox News, counted his death twice, being confused by reports that listed him as both Mohammed Tahar and Yasir al Silmi. This missile's primary target was an individual named either \\"Usayd al-Adani\\", or \\"Mossad al-Adani\\", or \\"Sa'ad Atef\\", reported to be an experienced bomb-maker, and AQAP's emir of either Abyan Province, Shabwah Province, or all of Yemen.

History The parish church of Southwold is dedicated to St Edmund, and is considered to be one of Suffolk's finest. It lies under one continuous roof, and was built over about 60 years from the 1430s to the 1490s; it replaced a smaller 13th-century church that was destroyed by fire. The earlier church dated from the time when Southwold was a small fishing hamlet adjacent to the larger Reydon. By the 15th century Southwold was an important town in its own right, and the church was rebuilt to match its power and wealth. Angels in the ceiling The church is renowned for its East Anglian flushwork, especially that of the tower. Knapped and unknapped flints are arranged in patterns, textures and designs and create the stone work. The curving letters over the west window are most famous: SCT. EDMUND ORA P. NOBIS (St Edmund pray for us). Each letter is crowned, and set in knapped flints. Originally roofed in lead, from 1948 to 2015 the church had a copper clad roof with an easily recognisable flèche (or spirelet), above a clerestory of eighteen windows. The flèche was purely for display, and has never contained a bell. The tower has no parapet and is a very fine piece of architecture, with its large bell openings. The roof of the nave is so high that it makes the tower seem shorter than it really is; but it is at least 100 feet high. All of the church's medieval glass was destroyed by William Dowsing in 1644; the only stained glass windows in the church are the east windows over the altar (1954, by Sir Ninian Comper) and the west window below the grand tower. In World War II the church was narrowly missed by a German bomb that destroyed houses in the nearby Hollyhock Square. The bomb did not do much damage to the building itself but blew out most of the windows - another reason why the church has very little stained glass. The church was tidied very quickly for the funerals, a short while later, of the people killed by the bomb. In the interior, the rood screen is considered by many to be the finest in the county. It stretches all the way across the church, and is made up of three separate screens: a rood screen across the chancel arch and parclose screens across the north and south chancel aisles. A 15th century clock jack stands at the west end. He has an axe and bell which he uses to strike the time, and has a twin at Blythburgh. The Southwold jack is named \\"Southwold Jack\\", and is one of the symbols of the Adnams brewery. The font has been badly mutilated but is still very impressive with its large ornate cover. The roof in the chancel is painted and its height gives the church a very open feeling. Present-day church community life is extremely diverse and makes good use of St Edmund's Hall (also destroyed during the Second World War and rebuilt) to the rear of the church. Restorations Detail from north side of the chancel screen The roofs were restored in 1857 by Edward Lushington Blackburne and in 1866-1867 by Richard Phipson. The chancel was restored in 1885. Following bomb damage to the lead roof during the Second World War, it was entirely replaced with copper in 1948. This covering degraded over time, partly due to the church's seaside environment, and it was decided in 2013 to reroof the entire church, including replacing the flèche, in lead. The work began at the start of 2015, with completion later in that year. The flagpole atop the tower was previously surmounted by a golden weathervane in the form of a sailing longshore fishing vessel, but the pole has since been replaced and the weathervane removed. The church following 2015 reroofing, with golden weathervane Bells Southwold Church tower in the snow Southwold tower contains a ring of eight bells hung for change ringing. The tower held five bells in 1553. Over the years these bells have been recast and others added to create the current eight. The current fourth and fifth are probable recasts of the originals, having been cast in 1668 by John Darbie of Ipswich. The third dates from 1820 and is by William Dobson of Downham Market. In 1828 one bell was recast and a further two added. The bell that was recast is the present tenor, also by William Dobson. The sixth and seventh were added and are likely to originate from All Saints, South Elmham. Both are medieval bells, the sixth being cast around 1538 by William Barker and the seventh by Brasyers of Norwich around 1513. The two trebles date from 1881 and are by Moore, Holmes & Mackenzie of Redenhall, Norfolk.Taken from Doves Guide. 27 January 2009. However, a peal of Oxford Treble Bob Major was rung on 26 July 1858, indicating that the tower possessed a ring of eight prior to 1881.Taken from Felstead Database. 5 September 2011. The tenor (the largest) weighs 10¾ cwt or about 546 kg, and the treble (the lightest) about half of that. The bells hang in a timber frame installed in 1897 by George Day & Son of Eye, Suffolk. In 1990 the bells were rehung on new fittings and the frame strengthened by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. There is a large amount of space surrounding the frame, allowing ease of access and maintenance. The clock uses the seventh bell to strike the hours. There are no bells in the tower other than the ringing peal. The bells are rung from a ringing chamber some 52 steps up the tower. The chamber has many mementos of past campanological achievements. The tower is affiliated to the Suffolk Guild of Ringers. The bells are rung regularly for Sunday services, weddings and other special occasions. Organ The organ in Southwold The church has a three manual pipe organ, originally built by J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd in 1887 and later rebuilt by the Thaxted firm Arnold, Williamson & Hyatt in 1966. The specification, drawn up by Sir Frederick Ouseley, a Professor of Music at Oxford University, may be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

Phylogenetic studies have placed them as either early representatives of a group called Stereospondylomorpha, or close relatives of a group called Eryopidae. Stereospondylomorpha is a large clade mostly made up of Mesozoic taxa, while Eryopidae is a small family consisting of several Carboniferous and Permian temnospondyls. These two groups are usually considered distantly related. Schoch & Witzmann (2009) conducted a phylogenetic analysis in which Eryopidae and Stereospondylomorpha were found to be closely related, both members of a clade called Eryopoidea.

On 13 July 2012, he was detained after publishing pictures of a protest by a Swedish advertising company in which teddy bears were airdropped into the country with slogans advertising freedom of speech. The teddy bears were dropped on 4 July 2012 by Studio Total, a Swedish advertising firm. The group called the mission \\"Teddybear Airdrop Minsk 2012\\". A plane piloted by Tomas Mazetti took off from a town near Kaunas, Lithuania, and illegally entered Belarusian airspace, proceeding over the town of Ivyanets. The group then released 1,000 teddy bears holding cards and banners with protest slogans. When the Belarusian government denied that the incident had taken place, Studio Total released 90 minutes of footage of the flight, which Radio Free Europe reported that they had confirmed with experts had not been doctored. On 26 July, Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko acknowledged the drop had occurred as reported. Following the drop, Suryapin posted photographs on his website that he said had been e-mailed to him by an Ivyanets resident. On 13 July, his home was searched, his computer confiscated, and he was detained as an accomplice. On 19 July, Studio Total founder Per Cromwell published an open letter in which he stated that the group \\"never told Anton Suryapin or indeed any other Belarus citizen in advance about what we planned to do. We love (respect) and admire them too much to expose them to such risks.\\" The letter also called Lukashenko an \\"armed clown\\". On 24 July, Suryapin still had been not been released from prison, leading BBC News and other sources to conclude that charges had been filed against him, as Belarusian law only allows ten days of detention without charge. Amnesty International described the arrest as \\"a further nail in the coffin of freedom of expression and association in Belarus\\", and named Suryapin a prisoner of conscience. Index on Censorship described the case against Suryapin as \\"ludicrous\\", stating, \\"Not for the first time, the authorities in Belarus have found someone to blame for something they say hasn’t happened.\\" The Committee to Protect Journalists called the charges \\"senseless\\" and called for Suryapin's immediate release. On 28 June, 2013, Belarus' State Security Committee publicly announced that the criminal case was closed, and the charges against Suryapin and real estate agent Syarhei Basharimau (who had rented an apartment in the capital to two Swedes connected with Studio Total) were dropped. Bail conditions were lifted and they were allowed to leave the country if they wished.https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/12000/eur490112013en.pdf  References   External links  * Official website 1992 births Living people Belarusian journalists Amnesty International prisoners of conscience held by Belarus Place of birth missing (living people) Imprisoned journalists ","title":"Anton Suryapin"},{"id":"36536503","title":"Federal Medical Center, Butner"},{"id":"36536546","text":"Birgitta Lillpers (born 1958) is a Swedish poet and novelist.

Established in 1963, WBWL is owned by iHeartMedia and serves the Boston metropolitan area. The station broadcasts a country music format. The station's studios are located in Medford and the transmitter site is on Murray Hill, also in Medford. History WBWL signed on August 5, 1963 as WLYN-FM, owned by Puritan Broadcasting Service along with WLYN (1360 AM). At the outset, WLYN-FM largely simulcast its AM sister station during hours in which the AM was on the air. During the 1970s, the simulcast was cut to drive time, with WLYN-FM brokering the remaining time to ethnic programmers; by 1974, the station's English-language programming included country music. Although WLYN changed its call letters to WNSR in 1977, WLYN-FM retained its call sign, but dropped the \\"-FM\\" suffix; both changes were reversed on December 31, 1979. WLYN-FM began to devote its nighttime programming to new wave music in 1981; the following year, the station had become a full-time modern rock station known as \\"Y102,\\" with the ethnic programming moving to the AM station. In September 1982, Puritan announced that it would sell WLYN-FM to Stephen Mindich, publisher of the Boston Phoenix; the station eventually became part of the Phoenix Media/Communications Group. Mindich retained the modern rock format upon assuming control in March 1983, relaunching it on April 11 as \\"Boston Phoenix Radio,\\" with the WFNX call letters coming into use ten days earlier. WFNX would subsequently become one of the earliest alternative rock stations. WFNX broadened its focus to Greater Boston after the sale to Mindich, opening a sales office at the Phoenix offices in Boston, but its studios remained in the same building as WLYN in Lynn. The station did move its transmitter from WLYN's tower in Lynn to Medford in 1987 and to One Financial Center in Boston in 2006 to provide a better signal within the market; from 1998 to 2006, a translator station, W276AI (101.3 FM) was operated from the John Hancock Tower to improve WFNX's reception in Boston, but was discontinued when the move to One Financial Center rendered it redundant. During 1999 and 2000, Phoenix Media/Communications Group also acquired WCDQ (92.1 FM, renamed WPHX-FM) in Sanford, Maine, WNHQ (92.1 FM, renamed WFEX) in Peterborough, New Hampshire, and WWRX-FM (103.7 FM) in Westerly, Rhode Island to serve as WFNX simulcast stations. WWRX-FM was sold to Entercom, eventually becoming WVEI-FM, in 2004, while WPHX-FM was sold to Aruba Capital Partners, becoming WXEX-FM, in 2011. Even with these expansions, WFNX broadcast at a lower power than other Boston market stations, limiting WFNX's signal in the outer portions of the market. WHBA's logo as \\"101.7 The Harbor,\\" used from July 24, 2012 to December 19, 2012 Phoenix Media/Communications Group announced on May 16, 2012 that it would sell WFNX to iHeartMedia (then known as Clear Channel Communications), after finding it difficult to sustain its continued operation. The next day, WFEX was sold to Blount Communications, which would rename that station WDER- FM. Live programming ended on July 20, 2012, with the last song being \\"Let's Go to Bed\\" by The Cure (the first song on WFNX in 1983); an automated version of WFNX remained available online until March 2013, when the Boston Phoenix publication shut down (citing huge financial losses), and was also heard on 101.7 FM until 4:00 p.m. on July 24, 2012 when Clear Channel assumed control of the station. At that time, after playing \\"Shake It Out\\" by Florence and The Machine, 101.7 began stunting with a loop of the Boston-famous song \\"Dirty Water\\" by The Standells. At approximately 4:28 p.m., WFNX relaunched as WHBA, an adult hits station branded as \\"101.7 The Harbor.\\" The first song on \\"The Harbor\\" was \\"Sweet Emotion\\" by locally founded band Aerosmith. The launch of WHBA marked the return of the adult hits format to the Boston market; a similar format aired on WMKK (93.7 FM) from March 2005 until it became WEEI-FM in September 2011. WEDX's logo as \\"Evolution 101.7,\\" used from December 20, 2012 to June 12, 2014 On December 20, 2012, at 6:00 p.m., the station flipped to dance, branded as \\"Evolution 101.7,\\" the format had been launched as an online station on Clear Channel's iHeartRadio service six weeks earlier. The final song on \\"The Harbor\\" was \\"Sweet Caroline\\" by Neil Diamond (a song that has become synonymous with the city of Boston through its playing at Fenway Park during Red Sox games), while the first song on \\"Evolution\\" was \\"Don't You Worry Child\\" by Swedish House Mafia. As \\"Evolution,\\" the station claimed to be \\"the first real EDM station in the country.\\" The call letters were changed to WEDX on January 2, 2013. On January 14, 2013, Sisanie, who provides voicetracks for several top 40 and rhythmic top 40 stations also owned by iHeartMedia (including WEDX's sister station WXKS-FM), became the first \\"airstaffer\\" to be added to WEDX's daily lineup, voicetracking in afternoons.from Sisanie's Twitter account (January 14, 2013) In December 2013, the station began simulcasting on WXKS-FM's HD2 channel, which previously broadcast an all-comedy format. The move was because of WEDX's limited signal, which is nulled to the south to protect Providence and Cape Cod-based sister stations WWBB (101.5 FM) and WCIB (101.9 FM). On June 13, 2014, at noon, after playing \\"How You Love Me\\" by 3LAU, WEDX began airing a country music stunt and asking listeners to go online and use the hashtag \\"#CountryOn1017\\" to vote on what artists the station should play. At 3:00 p.m., WEDX officially flipped to country, branded as \\"101.7 The Bull\\". The first song on \\"The Bull\\" was \\"This Is How We Roll\\" by Florida-Georgia Line. The new format competes against established country station WKLB-FM (102.5 FM), and serves as the Boston affiliate of the syndicated Bobby Bones Show. \\"Evolution\\" remained available through WXKS-FM's HD2 channel, the iHeartRadio mobile application, and in early-morning blocks on Saturdays and Sundays on WXKS-FM; \\"Evolution\\" returned to 101.7 on its HD2 channel on December 19, 2017. The call letters were changed to WBWL on June 30, 2014 to match the new format. iHeartMedia had filed with the FCC to downgrade the signals of stations it owns in Rhode Island (WWBB) and on Cape Cod (WCIB), which enabled WBWL to offer a non- directional, upgraded signal, from the previous transmitter site in Medford. The modifications were completed in August 2014.https://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi- bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?context=25&appn;=101684549&formid;=1&fac;_num=40824http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/89644/clear- channel-to-modify-three-signals-to-upgrade-101-7-boston/ Clear Channel to Modify Three Signals to Upgrade 101.7 Bostonhttps://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi- bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?context=25&appn;=101642700&formid;=301&fac;_num=40824 \\"Evolution\\" would be removed from WBWL-HD2 entirely on June 26, 2019, when it flipped to iHeart's \\"Pride Radio\\" format of Top 40/Dance music targeting the LGBTQ community. This marks the second such format to air in Boston, the other being Entercom's \\"Channel Q\\" network airing on WBGB-HD2. iHeartMedia Expands Pride Radio to 12 Additional Markets References External links Lynn, Massachusetts Country radio stations in the United States Radio stations established in 1963 BWL Mass media in Essex County, Massachusetts 1963 establishments in Massachusetts IHeartMedia radio stations ","title":"WBWL (FM)"},{"id":"36536655","title":"Cycling at the Pan American Games"},{"id":"36536667","text":"Karl Gunnar Harding (born 11 June 1940) is a Swedish poet, novelist, essayist and translator, considered 'one of Sweden's foremost poets'.Roger Greenwald, 'Introduction', in Gunnar Harding, Guarding the Air: Selected Poems of Gunnar Harding, ed. and trans. by Roger Greenwald (Boston, MA: Black Widow Press, 2014), p. 13.

He was promoted to the rank of major-general in 1762, and obtained the colonelcy of the 12th Regiment of Dragoons in 1764, from which he was removed to the 4th Regiment of Dragoons on 24 October 1770.

He was appointed clerk marshal of the mews on 6 April 1771 and principal equerry in the royal establishment on 1 January 1783.

Not much is known about the church before the 1600s, but in 1639 an old church was demolished and a new log building in a cruciform design was built on the same location.

The Republican Party selected its statewide ticket at a convention in May 2013. Primaries were held on June 11, 2013, in which the Democratic Party selected its ticket, and contested races for party nominations were decided. Democrat Terry McAuliffe was elected governor with 48% of the vote to 45% for Republican Ken Cuccinelli. Democrat Ralph Northam was elected lieutenant governor with 55% of the vote to 45% for Republican E.W. Jackson. In the attorney general election, Democrat Mark Herring beat Republican Mark Obenshain by 1,103,777 votes to 1,103,612 - a difference of 165 votes out of more than 2.2 million cast, or 0.007%. After a recount, Obenshain conceded the election on December 18, and later that day, the recount ended with Herring winning by 907 votes, or 0.04%. With Herring's victory, Democrats held all five statewide offices — including both U.S. Senate seats — for the first time since 1970. Governor The incumbent governor, Republican Bob McDonnell, was not eligible to run for re- election due to term limits established by the Virginia Constitution. Virginia is the only state that prohibits its governor from serving immediate successive terms. =Republican candidates= Lieutenant Governor Bill Bolling and Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli had both indicated that they were running for the Republican Party's nomination for governor. Bolling withdrew from the race on November 28, 2012, making Cuccinelli the de facto nominee. Cuccinelli was formally nominated at the state convention on May 18, 2013. =Democratic candidates= Terry McAuliffe, former chairman of the Democratic National Committee and a candidate in the Democratic gubernatorial primary in 2009, declared his intent to again seek the Democratic nomination in November 2012. On April 2, 2013, The Democratic Party of Virginia certified that McAuliffe was the only candidate to file for the June primary, and was therefore the Democratic nominee. =Libertarian candidate= Robert Sarvis, a lawyer and businessman, was nominated as the Libertarian Party of Virginia's official candidate on April 21, 2013, at a special convention. Sarvis' campaign submitted over 17,000 signatures to meet the Virginia State Board of Elections requirement of 10,000 valid signatures. On June 26, 2013, the SBE confirmed to Sarvis' campaign that he would be listed on the ballot. This makes Sarvis the fourth minor party gubernatorial nominee to get on the Virginia ballot in the last 40 years. =General election= Results Lieutenant Governor After Republicans took two seats in the Virginia Senate in the 2011 elections to bring the Senate to a 20–20 tie, Republican Lieutenant Governor Bill Bolling gained significant power with his tie-breaking vote. The Washington Post reported in November 2011 that this led to increased interest and speculation as to who would run for the post in 2013. =Republican candidates= E. W. Jackson, a pastor, conservative activist and candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2012 was nominated after four ballots at the Republican convention. He defeated former state senator Jeannemarie Devolites Davis, State Representative Scott Lingamfelter, State Senator Steve Martin, Prince William Board of County Supervisors Chairman Corey Stewart, Stafford County Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Susan B. Stimpson and venture capitalist and Fox News commentator Pete Snyder. =Democratic candidates= In the June primary, State Senator Ralph Northam defeated Aneesh Chopra, former Chief Technology Officer of the United States and Secretary of Technology under Governor Tim Kaine. =General election= Results Attorney General Incumbent attorney general Ken Cuccinelli did not run for re- election. The race was the most competitive of the three Virginia statewide elections. The Virginia State Board of Elections initially reported that Herring led Obenshain by 1,103,777 votes to 1,103,612 - a difference of 165 votes out of more than 2.2 million cast. The results were certified on November 25, declaring Herring as the winner by 165 votes. Obenshain requested a recount, and conceded on December 18, 2013, after Herring's lead grew in the recount to 810 votes. =Republican candidates= On May 18, 2013, a Republican state convention in Richmond nominated state Senator Mark Obenshain of Harrisonburg over state Delegate Rob Bell. =Democratic candidates= The Democratic primary was won by State Senator Mark Herring, who defeated former Assistant United States Attorney Justin Fairfax. =General election= =Results= The results were certified on November 25, 2013. Obenshain requested a recount due to the close race, as allowed for by Virginia law when the margin is under 1%. After the recount did not change the results substantially, Obenshain conceded on December 18, 2013.Obenshain concedes in Va. AG race House of Delegates Republicans currently hold 68 seats and Democrats hold 32 seats in the 100-seat House of Delegates. =Primaries= Four incumbent Republicans were challenged in primaries that centered around Gov. McDonnell's controversial transportation funding overhaul that imposed a $1.2 billion per year tax increase. 34 House Republicans voted for the bill, causing an uproar amongst conservatives. No sitting Republican delegate had faced a primary challenge since 2005. In the June 11, 2013 primary, two veteran Republicans who supported the transportation plan were defeated: businessman Dave LaRock beat 33rd District Del. Joe T. May 57%-43%, and physician Mark Berg ousted 29th District Del. Beverly Sherwood by a 51%-49% margin. Both May and Sherwood held committee chairmanships; their ouster opens the chairmanships of the Transportation Committee (chaired by May) and the Agriculture, Chesapeake and Natural Resources Committee (chaired by Sherwood). House Speaker Bill Howell and Del. Bobby Orrock handily defeated their primary challengers. In the Democratic primaries, Del. Rosalyn Dance staved off a challenge from Evandra Thompson, who said Dance voted with Republicans too often, winning by less than 300 votes. Del. Algie Howell easily beat his primary challenger. =Open seats= *In the 4th District, incumbent Democrat Joseph P. Johnson is retiring. Republican Ben Chafin, an attorney and farmer, ran unopposed as no Democrats filed to run for the seat. *In the 6th District, incumbent Republican Anne B. Crockett-Stark is also retiring.

Blough (January 19, 1904 October 8, 1985) was the chairman of the board and chief executive officer of the United States Steel Corporation for 13½ years, from May 1955 through January 1969. In this position, he is best known for serving as the American steel industry's principal spokesman when the industry clashed in April 1962 with President John F. Kennedy on the issue of commodity steel prices. Biography Blough attended Susquehanna University and was a member of Phi Mu Delta fraternity. When Time magazine featured Blough in July 1959, they drew attention to the challenges facing the steel industry in the late 1950s, including inflation and competition from non-U.S. steel exporters. He served as Chairman of The Business Council in 1961 and 1962.The Business Council, Official website, Background As a consequence of this inflation, Blough told the White House in April 1962 that it was the intent of the U.S. steel industry to raise a basket of steel prices by a scale averaging $6.00/ton. President Kennedy believed that this price increase violated an unwritten agreement that he had brokered between the industry and the United Steel Workers union, and called a press conference in response, held on April 11, 1962. In nationally televised remarks, the President described Blough as one of: “a tiny handful of steel executives whose pursuit of private power and profit exceeds their sense of public responsibility... Some time ago I asked each American to consider what he would do for his country and I asked the steel companies. In the last 24 hours we had their answer.” Blough and U.S. Steel rolled back the threatened price hike. In 1969, Blough retired from U.S. Steel and founded the Construction Users Anti-Inflation Roundtable, \\"affectionately known\\" as \\"Roger's Rountable\\". In 1972, the group merged with March Group and the Labor Law Study Group (LLSG) to form Business Roundtable.Beder, Sharon Suiting Themselves: How Corporations Drive the Global Agenda; Earthscan; 2012, pgs. 11-12.

The band released it in 1986, the 50th anniversary of the Spanish Revolution, on their own label as a square 7\\" (17.5 cm) soft-cover book with two 45 rpm records. A 5\\" (12.5 cm) hardcover edition was republished by AK press in 1997, replacing the records with a pair of 3\\" CDs. Background and book In 1936 two Spanish anarchist trade unions, the CNT and the FAI, waged war against Francisco Franco's nationalist troops siding with Spain's legitimate republican government, until Franco defeated the republican army in 1939 with the help of fascism German and Italian troops. With further involvement from the Soviet Union, France, Mexico and Portugal, the conflict is widely regarded as the first battle of World War II. In wanting to highlight the original values and spirit of the revolution rather than the conflict and eventual defeat of anarchist forces, The Ex compiled 144 pages of previously unpublished photographs taken by journalists aligned with the revolutionary forces, along with several short essays about the revolution. Text appears in both English and Spanish. At the time Dutch publishing house Raket & Lont were compiling a book of comics and essays about the Spanish Civil War and has unearthed the CNT's archives at Amsterdam's International Institute for Social History. The archives had been smuggled out of Spain in 1937 and arrived in Amsterdam by way of England, but had languished in obscurity for five decades due to a post-revolutionary factionism among the CNT's former members. Dutch cartoonist Johannes van der Weert, formerly of thecommunist punk band The Rondos, arranged for members of The Ex to visit the archive and then to publish the photos, highlighting the revolution from the perspective of anarchist achievement rather than the war and defeat under fire by Axis forces. Music For the audio component of the album, The Ex recorded four tracks at Koeienverhuur Studios and invited van der Weert to contribute vocals. Two are Spanish language songs with music and lyrics originally sung by 1930s Spanish revolutionary forces and supporters. On the flip side of each single was an English language song about the revolution, one assembled from lines borrowed from other Spanish revolutionary songs, the other quoted an interview with a campesino recorded in Ronald Fraser's book, Blood Of Spain. Release The Ex contacted British label Ron Johnson Records about releasing the album. The band hand-assembled the covers in the Netherlands before shipping it to England for finishing. In order to keep the album affordable, the label offered it to distributors below its actual cost, voluntarily losing money on it in order for it to reach more people. For its 1986 release, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Spanish Revolution, the music appeared on two 7\\" singles that sandwiched the album of 144 photos. Following its release The Ex toured with van der Weert on second vocals, playing all over Europe with British band The Membranes and developing a collaboration with the anarchist band Chumbawamba, leading to the material that would comprise The Ex's next album, Too Many Cowboys. In 1997 The Ex rereleased 1936: The Spanish Revolution as a five-inch square hardback book in tandem with Scottish/American publisher AK Press, this time issuing the double singe as a pair of mini-CDs. Later the band issued the music tracks digitally for streaming and download, along with the bulk of their back catalog, via Bandcamp. Reception 1936 was the first of The Ex's releases to gain some notoriety outside of the Netherlands, selling enough copies to reach No. 6 on the UK Indie Chart. The website AllMusic later called the book a \\"powerful and enlightening visual document that casts a fresh light on a major historical event little understood in the United States,\\" and said that The Ex's music \\"find them inviting the spirit of the revolution as if it occurred five minutes ago, not 50 years past.\\" Track list #\\"They Shall Not Pass\\" #\\"El Tren Blindado\\" #\\"Ay Carmela\\" #\\"People Again\\" Musicians The Ex: *Luc (bass, guitar, backing vocals) *Katrin (drums, hand-clapping, backing vocals) *Terrie (guitars, hand-clapping, backing vocals) *G.W.

On May 28, 1998, rulings were handed down. In the case bought by the Honshu carriers, presiding Judge Saburo Takase said that while JR companies were responsible for selecting personnel to start up their new entities, they were not obligated to compensate unhired JNR workers. He said that if there were unfair labor practices were committed in choosing employees, the JR companies are responsible, but the labor commission should only order the firms to repeat their employment process, not to rehire the workers.

He is one of the few patriarchs in the Latin Church of the Catholic Church, along with the Patriarchs of Venice, the East Indies, and Jerusalem. The diocese of Lisbon was created in the 4th century, but it lay vacant after 716 when the city was captured by the Moors; the diocese was restored when the city was captured by king Afonso I of Portugal during the Second Crusade in 1147. In 1393, Lisbon was raised to the dignity of a metropolitan archdiocese by Pope Boniface IX with the papal bull In eminentissimae dignitatis. In 1716, at the request of King John V, Pope Clement XI issued the bull In Supremo Apostolatus Solio granting the rank of Patriarch to the King's Chaplain, who had since been made Archbishop of West Lisbon. The bull Inter praecipuas apostolici ministerii, issued by Pope Clement XII in 1737, established that whoever was appointed Patriarch of Lisbon was to be elevated to the rank of cardinal at the next consistory. Lisbon is the only episcopal see to enjoy this distinction, while other patriarchs are made cardinals by custom only. Insignia of the Patriarch of Lisbon José de Almeida Neto, featuring the papal tiara The See of Lisbon has been granted extraordinary ceremonial privileges. The Patriarchs of Lisbon were entitled to unique rights of vesture and ceremony that imitated the grandeur of the papal court: notably, the cassocks of his cathedral canons were scarlet (like those of cardinals), and his chapter has three orders like those of the College of Cardinals. Among the unique privileges granted to the Patriarch of Lisbon (and never withdrawn, though most have fallen into disuse) were the right to wear the fanon, subcinctorium and falda, vestments otherwise reserved for the Pope. A unique mitre, similar to the papal tiara, was conceded at the same time. The Patriarch was also allowed to use a sedia gestatoria along with two flabella for processions — the practice of receiving Holy Communion at the throne in solemn Masses was not conceded to the Patriarch of Lisbon, however. Also notably, the Patriarch of Lisbon can use a papal tiara (without the cross keys of Saint Peter) over his coat of arms.

The protein encoded by this gene is a phosphatidylglycerol remodeling protein found at the interface of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticula, where it mediates phospholipid exchange. The encoded protein plays a major role in mitochondrial function and intracellular cholesterol trafficking. Defects in this gene are a cause of 3-methylglutaconic aciduria with deafness, encephalopathy, and Leigh-like syndrome (MEGDEL). Two transcript variants, one protein-coding and the other non-protein coding, have been found for this gene.  Structure  The SERAC1 gene is located on the q arm of chromosome 6 at position 25.3 and it spans 58,776 base pairs. The SERAC1 gene produces an 18.7 kDa protein composed of 162 amino acids. The structure of the encoded protein contains a C-terminal serine-lipase/esterase domain containing the consensus lipase motif GxSxG, and an N-terminal signal sequence.  Function  The SERAC1 gene encodes for a protein necessary for phosphatidylglycerol remodeling. phosphatidylglycerol remodeling is a process of altering or remodeling a particular phospholipid called phosphatidylglycerol. Phosphatidylglycerol helps make cardiolipin, an important ingredient that surrounds the Inner mitochondrial membrane. Cardiolipin is responsible for converting energy acquired from food to a cell- usable form and required for proper mitochondrial function. Because of cardiolipin, the remodeling process of phosphatidylglycerol is essential for mitochondrial function and intracellular cholesterol trafficking. Additionally, SERAC1 is involved in the movement of cholesterol, which are fatty, waxy substances within cells. Cholesterol is a component of cell structure, and produces hormones and digestive acids. The protein may also be involved in the transacylation-acylation reaction to produce phosphatidylglycerol-36:1 and bis(monoacylglycerol)phosphate biosynthetic pathway.  Clinical Significance  Mutations in the SERAC1 gene have been associated to impairment of both mitochondrial function and intracellular cholesterol trafficking. Such mutations have been majorly associated withand Leigh syndrome and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria with deafness, encephalopathy, and Leigh-like syndrome, known as MEGDEL syndrome. =MEGDEL syndrome= SERAC1 mutations have been heavily associated with MGDEL syndrome. MGDEL syndrome (3-methylglutaconic aciduria with deafness, encephalopathy, and Leigh-like syndrome) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by childhood onset of delayed psychomotor development or psychomotor regression, sensorineural deafness, spasticity or dystonia and increased excretion of 3-methylglutaconic acid. Brain imaging shows cerebral and cerebellar atrophy as well as lesions in the basal ganglia reminiscent of Leigh syndrome. Laboratory studies show increased serum lactate and alanine, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation defects, abnormal mitochondria, abnormal phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin profiles in fibroblasts, and abnormal accumulation of unesterified cholesterol within cells. The SERAC1 gene mutations that cause this condition reduce the amount of SERAC1 protein that is produced or lead to production of a protein with little or no function. As a result, phosphatidylglycerol remodeling is impaired, which likely alters the composition of cardiolipin. Researchers speculate that the abnormal cardiolipin affects mitochondrial function, reducing cellular energy production and leading to the neurological and hearing problems characteristic of MEGDEL syndrome. It is unclear how SERAC1 gene mutations lead to abnormal release of 3-methylglutaconic acid in the urine. A c.202C>T mutation in this gene has been found in a patient suffering from 3-methylglutaconic aciduria, and related symptoms. Two patients with Homozygous G>C transversions in the SERAC1 gene have been found to show symptoms of MEGDEL syndrome with deafness, encephalopathy, and Leigh-like syndrome. Another patient with a homozygous 4 base pair deletion (1167delTCAG) showed symptoms of recurrent infections, failure to thrive, mental retardation, spasticity and extrapyramidal symptoms. =Leigh syndrome= Leigh syndrome is an early-onset progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the presence of focal, bilateral lesions in one or more areas of the central nervous system including the brainstem, thalamus, basal ganglia, cerebellum and spinal cord. Clinical features depend on which areas of the central nervous system are involved and include subacute onset of psychomotor retardation, hypotonia, ataxia, muscle weakness, vision loss, eye movement abnormalities, seizures, and dysphagia.

LA 3114 was an undivided, two-lane highway for its entire length. History The Covington Bypass was conceived in the mid-1950s as part of a series of highway improvements associated with the construction of the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway. The bypass was to provide an alternate route around the downtown area for traffic on U.S. 190 and LA 25.

The eighteenth cyclone and fourth subtropical storm of the 1974 Atlantic hurricane season, the storm developed near eastern Cuba on October 4 from an area of disturbed weather. Shortly before striking Andros Island on October 6, the system strengthened into a subtropical storm. The storm made its closest approach to Florida early on October 7\\\\. Peaking with sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h), the system veered northward and then northeastward, but nonetheless caused heavy rainfall and coastal flooding on land in Florida. While paralleling offshore North Carolina and South Carolina, the storm began to slowly weaken. By late on October 8, the subtropical cyclone merged with a cold front while well east of Cape Hatteras. Gale force winds were observed by ships and land stations in The Bahamas. The storm and a stationary high pressure system over the Eastern United States resulted in strong winds and rough seas along the coast of Florida for several days, especially on October 6\\\\. Many coastal areas observed sustained winds of , with higher gusts. The storm also produced isolated pockets of heavy rainfall, including of precipitation in Boca Raton. Dozens of homes were flooded in Boca Raton and Pompano Beach. The heavy rainfall destroyed about 50% of winter vegetable crops in Broward County and about 25% of the eggplant crop and about 5%-10% of other crops in Palm Beach County. The storm also brought rainfall and abnormally high tides to Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Bermuda. Damage totaled at least $600,000 (1974 USD). Meteorological history A quasi-stationary cold front moved southeastward toward Cuba on October 3\\\\. Shortly thereafter, a low pressure area developed along its axis. At 00:00 UTC on October 4, Subtropical Depression Four developed offshore eastern Cuba. It then drifted north-northwestward and intensified slowly. Due to a large high pressure area, the cold front, and the subtropical cyclone, gale force winds began spreading into the eastern Gulf of Mexico, the Straits of Florida, and adjacent land areas. At 16:00 UTC on October 5, the National Hurricane Center stated that a low pressure center developed in the central Bahamas, though it was not classified as a subtropical cyclone. Late on October 5, ships crossing through the central Bahamas reported gale force winds. The system intensified into a subtropical storm at 00:00 UTC on October 6\\\\. Shortly thereafter, the subtropical storm struck Andros Island in The Bahamas with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). The storm approached Florida and passed about east of West Palm Beach, Florida on October 7\\\\. Around that time, the system peaked with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). Thereafter, the cyclone slowly weakened as it veered northeastward and avoided landfall in Florida. As it was paralleling offshore of the Carolinas between October 7 and October 8, ships continued to report gale force winds. By late on October 8, the system merged with a cold front while located about 405 mi (650 km) east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The remnants accelerated northeastward and became unidentifiable north of Bermuda on October 9\\\\. Impact Rainfall totals associated with the subtropical storm in the United States During the storm's early stages, several ships and land stations in the Bahamas observed gale force winds. A strong, persistent high pressure system became stationary over the Eastern United States while the subtropical storm was developing over The Bahamas. This meteorological pattern resulted in very rough seas and strong winds over Florida for several days, especially when the subtropical storm made its closest approach on October 6. As a result, gale warnings were issued from the Jupiter Inlet northward to Savannah, Georgia, beginning at 21:00 UTC on October 6, as were small craft warnings around the entire Florida peninsula and northward to Virginia Beach, Virginia. Along the east coast of Florida, several weather stations reported sustained winds between , with gusts exceeding at some locations. Tides generally were about above normal, leaving widespread erosion and threatening several oceanfront structures. Many coastal streets were closed due to either sand deposited on the roads or tidal flooding. Isolated areas also observed heavy rainfall. Precipitation peaked at in Boca Raton, while other areas such as Deerfield Beach and Cocoa reported and of rainfall, respectively. Waves left of water on State Road A1A in Hollywood, resulting in about of the road being closed. Dozens of homes were flooded in Pompano Beach. Along the beach, nearly of sand was lost in one section. State Road A1A was closed from 14th Street northward, while North Federal Highway was shut down between 9th Street and 15th Street. Deerfield Beach generally lost about of its shore due to erosion. Throughout Broward County, about 50% of winter vegetable crops were destroyed due to of rainfall in the northern part of the county. Sporadic losses of electricity occurred throughout the county due to falling tree limbs, but most outages were quickly restored. In Boca Raton, 5,000 homes were left without electricity and 2,500 homes lost telephone service at the height of the storm. Washouts occurred on two Interstate 95 overpasses. More than 100 cars were flooded. Floodwaters entered a few businesses along Dixie Highway, while firemen received 21 calls to pump water out of homes. Damage to city properties ranged from about $10,000-$15,000, while damage throughout the city may have reached approximately $500,000. The storm caused approximately $100,000 in beach erosion damage in Delray Beach. In Lake Worth, waves were observed along the shore, causing erosion south of the municipal pier. Abnormally high tides in West Palm Beach caused a brief closure of Flagler Drive between Monroe Drive and Southern Boulevard. Sporadic power outages were reported in the city due to falling tree limbs. In Palm Beach, minor coastal flooding occurred on South Ocean Boulevard. Throughout Palm Beach County, about 25% of the eggplant crop was destroyed, while about 5%-10% of pepper, squash, and tomato plants were lost. At the north end of Jupiter Island, waves severely damaged at least three homes. Many condominiums along Beach Road lost electricity after tree limbs fell on the wires. In Indian River County, some beaches lost several feet of sand. Erosion caused part of a restaurant in Vero Beach to collapse.

Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.  Description  The KCTD7 gene encodes a member of the potassium channel tetramerisation domain-containing protein family. Family members are identified on a structural basis and contain an amino-terminal domain similar to the T1 domain present in the voltage-gated potassium channel. KCTD7 displays a primary sequence and hydropathy profile indicating intracytoplasmic localization. EST database analysis showed that KCTD7 is expressed in human and mouse brain.  Function  KCTD7 expression hyperpolarizes the cell membrane and reduces the excitability of transfected neurons in patch clamp experiments. KCTD7 mRNA and protein are expressed in hippocampal neurons, deep layers of the cerebral cortex and Purkinje cells of the murine brain as shown by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry experiments. Immunoprecipitation assays demonstrates that KCTD7 is able to prudhommerie and directly interacts with cullin-3 (CUL3), a component of the ubiquitin ligase complex. These interactions are thought to be mediated via the BTB/POZ domain of KCTD7. However, KCTD7 does not show any interaction cullin-1 (CUL1). Immunoprecipitation assays also shows that KCTD7 does not interact with Ubiquitin-flag, suggesting a potential role of KCTD7 in the ubiquitin ligase complex without being itself subject to uiquitination. Immunofluorescence microscopy shows a cytosolic expression of the recombinant GFP-KCTD7 protein in transfected COS-7 cells. One possible hypothesis is that KCTD7 regulates indirectly the membrane expression level of a potassium channel. By conjugating with cullin-3 ubiquitin ligase complex, KCTD7 may modulate the expression level of a negative regulator of potassium channel. Therefore, the overexpression of KCTD7 in neurons would increase the degradation of that regulatory molecule leading to the increase of potassium current through the cell membrane as observed in patch clamp experiments. In cultured mouse hippocampal cells, expression is found in the cell soma, in neuritic varicosities along the developing neuronal extensions, and in neurite growth cones, but not in the nucleus. Kctd7 is widely expressed in neurons throughout the intact mouse brain, including in cortical neurons, in granular and pyramidal cell layers of the hippocampus, and in cerebellar Purkinje cells. However, not all neuronal cells are immunopositive for Kctd7, and expression is not seen in astrocytes or microglial cells. Expression is constant from P5 to 2 months in cerebellar lysates. Overexpression of KCTD7 in HeLa and COS-1 cells, which do not express endogenous KCTD7, shows diffuse cytosolic localization, with no colocalization with markers for endosomes, ER, Golgi, lysosomes, or the cytoskeleton. Beside the BTB/POZ domain of KCTD7, other residues are critical for its proper interaction with cullin-3. Furthermore, a full-length 31-kD Kctd7 isoform is expressed in mouse brain. Other major immunoreactive bands included a 28-kD species in the spleen, liver, and kidneys, a 37-kD species in the kidneys, and a 62-kD form most likely corresponding to a stable dimer. The presence of multiple bands was consistent with alternative splicing and tissue-specific regulation.  Clinical significance  In 3 affected members of a large consanguineous Moroccan family with progressive myoclonic epilepsy-3, a homozygous nonsense mutation in the KCTD7 gene (R99X) has been identified. In 2 Mexican siblings with infantile onset of progressive myoclonic epilepsy and pathologic findings of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis in multiple cell types, a homozygous mutation in the KCTD7 gene (R184C) has been identified. The mutation was identified by whole-exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. This phenotype has been identified as CLN14. KCTD7 mutations were not found in 32 additional CLN samples.

Urine from camels has been used in the Arabian Peninsula for medicinal purposes for centuries, being a part of Islamic prophetic medicine.  History in Islamic prophetic medicine  In the tradition of prophetic medicine in Islam, Muhammad is said to have encouraged its use among the sick \\"till their bodies became healthy.\\" The hadith also states \\"Some people of ‘Ukl or ‘Uraina tribe came to Medina and its climate did not suit them ... So the Prophet ordered them to go to the herd of (Milch) camels and to drink their milk and urine (as a medicine). ... So they went as directed and after they became healthy\\". Islamic scholar, Mohammad Najeeb Qasmi, states that Prophet Muhammad did not command the people to drink camel urine but to apply it externally as the actual word of the saying has the word Azmadu which means to apply a layer of something.https://archive.org/details/14newenglishbooks/page/n111/mode/2up However, Bachtiar Nasir, an Islamic cleric, advocated for and defended the consumption of camel urine, quoting the hadith. In response, scientists in Muslim and non-Muslim majority countries rejected the clerics claims. Abu Yusuf, a student of Abu Hanifah, said that there is no harm in using camel urine for medical treatment. However, according to Abū Ḥanīfah, the drinking of camel urine is discouraged.  Usage and effects  In Yemen, it is drunk and is used for treating ailments, though it has been widely denounced. Some salons are said use it as a treatment for hair loss. The camel urine from a virgin camel is priced at twenty dollars per liter, with herders saying that it has curative powers. It is traditionally mixed with milk. The World Health Organization has said that camels are the source of the Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and has urged people who have \\"diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection\\" to avoid contact with camels, drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked. Experimental infections of dromedaries with MERS‐CoV didn't show any evidence of virus in the urine. Therefore, the camel urine is an unlikely source of virus transmission to humans.

Early life Bankson was born to Jennifer and Richard Bankson in San Francisco, California. She grew up in the affluent suburbs of the San Francisco bay area and was raised in a predominantly Christian household. At age eight, Bankson developed a rather innocuous strain of Acne vulgaris, which later transformed into an aggressive strain of acne conglobata by the time she was fourteen. Eventually her severe skin condition had progressed to the extent that it engulfed her entire face and most of her body. Bankson's parents tried tirelessly to treat their daughter's acne by taking her to 16 different specialists across the United States and western Europe, which proved unsuccessful. Bankson was bullied relentlessly for her severe acne and eventually pulled out of school as a result. She later studied with a private tutor to complete her education. Along with her skin condition, she also has uterus didelphys, a condition wherein she possesses two vaginas, two wombs, and two cervixes. Career =Modeling= Bankson had been working with local professional photographers and model coach Charleston Pierce when she decided to submit professional shots to modeling agencies in San Francisco. Bankson attended auditions for America's Next Top Model in Blackhawk and Los Angeles, but did not make it to the televised stages. Bankson has modeled for companies including Citizens of Humanity, HP, Davidson and Licht, Farouk Hair Systems, \\"Guess By Marciano\\" CHI (with Miss America Contestants and Abel Salazar), Biosilk, Prada, Bebe, along with appearing in other catalogs, magazines, local TV programmes, and runway shows. In April and May 2012, Bankson took part in appearances throughout Sephora stores in partnership with Hourglass Cosmetics. On September 13, 2012, Bankson walked at the Boy Meets Girl runway show at New York Fashion Week. =YouTube= In 2010, Bankson began making videos on the YouTube channel \\"Diamondsandheels14\\" on topics such as makeup, fashion, and lifestyle. The channel's most popular video, titled \\"Foundation Routine For Flawless Skin Acne Coverage\\", showing Bankson's bare skin and her secrets to cover her severe acne, gained international attention including that of Right This Minute, Good Morning America, \\"Anderson\\", The Today Show, The Insider, MSN, Fox News, and the front page of AOL, Yahoo, and MSN.

The SOC-R is designed so that the boat including its tractor and trailer fits aboard C-130 or larger aircraft. Special Boat Teams (SBT) perform an insertion/extraction delivery system called MEATS. MEATS allows an Army MH-47 helicopter to carry a SOC-R rigged to the underbelly of the helicopter with slings. The Combatant-Craft Crewmen use a rope to get from the helicopter onto the craft for insertions, and a ladder dropped down from the helicopter to get off the SOC-R craft when extracted.

Members of Special Boat Team 22 (SBT-22), based in Stennis, MS, who make up a tiny fraction of the total SWCCs, are the only ones who operate the SOC-R. These river crews conduct mainly clandestine combat missions, often operating at night with little or no air support. The SOC-R speed and tight turn radius are facilitated by the hull design. The slope of the SOC-R's V-shape belly essentially allows the boat to skate along the surface, with relatively little drag on the hull. There is no hanging rudder or propeller blades to snag on submerged roots and rocks. The SOC-R's five weapon mounts provide a 360-degree field of fire. The aft-mounted .50 cal covers the boat crew as they leave the shore after an extraction.

In 2019 Rani Lakhan-Narace was appointed as president of the Bocas Lit Fest.Julien Neaves, \\"Bocas president: Festival keeps on growing\\", Trinidad and Tobago Newsday, 1 April 2020. The festival's name derives from the Spanish word for mouth, boca – the organ of speech and song and storytelling – while also referencing the Bocas del Dragón (the Dragon's Mouths), which are the narrow straits off Trinidad’s north-west peninsula that connect the Gulf of Paria to the Caribbean Sea. For centuries, the Bocas were the gateways connecting Trinidad to the Caribbean and the Atlantic Ocean. The festival's strapline is: \\"Celebrating books, writers, and writing from the Caribbean and the rest of the world\\". The main venues are the National Library (NALIS)Annie Paul, \\"The Bocas Lit Fest 2011\\", Active Voice, 7 May 2011. and the Old Fire Station, in downtown Port of Spain,Marina Salandy- Brown, \\"What’s in a festival\\", Trinidad and Tobago Newsday, 26 April 2012. with satellite evening events at venues around the city. There is also a full programme of activities for young readers, sponsored by KFC, and in the run-up to the festival storytelling events take place in Tobago, Couva, Chaguanas, San Fernando, Point Fortin, Mayaro and Arima. A new venture is a year-round programme of events at The Writers Centre (TWC) at Alcazar Street, Port of Spain, and the 10th anniversary celebrations of Bocas in 2020 include plans for Caribbean writers with new books to participate in UK literary festivals as well as events at the British Library, Oxford University and the University of East Anglia. =History= The Bocas Lit Fest was held for the first time in 2011 – from Thursday, 28 April to Sunday, 1 May\\"2011 Bocas Lit Fest programme announced\\". – including readings, panel discussions, workshops, film screenings and art exhibitions.\\"Trinidad and Tobago's Bocas Literary Festival: Ready, set!\\", signifyinguyana.com, 24 March 2011.

Description L. cinerascens is very similar to L. occidentalis with more antenna segments but shorter overall antenna length. It can be distinguished from L. exotica by its shorter antennae and uropods, as well as its uniformly gray color and granular texture. The species name cinerascens comes from the Latin for \\"ashy,\\" referring to the gray color of this species. Life Cycle In the wild, L. cinerascens usually lives about 1 year (overwintering once) but occasionally lives up to 2.5 years (overwintering twice). Females breed in their first year for five months, then die before the second winter, typically producing one brood - two at the most. Reared in the lab, L. cinerascens has a longer lifespan and may produce 3 or more broods in a lifetime. L. cinerascens are parasitized by Thinoseius setifer, a mite attaching to the ligia's pleopods. Distribution G. H. A. Budde-Lund found samples of L. cinerascens on a long ocean exploration, and when he returned he couldn't remember if they had come from Japan, Manila or Chile, limiting our current knowledge of the full range of the species. It has also been found on Kuril Islands (specifically Kunashir Island) and Peter the Great Gulf in far western Russia. It is one of four ligia species to be found on Japanese coasts. Specifically, it is found mainly on Hokkaido, with a separate population in Tokyo Bay.

Academic background Rolando Pérez initiated his musical Studies in Santiago de Cuba, where he also began his career as cellist under the guidance of distinguished performer and professor Ernesto Xancó. In 1976 he graduated from Music Medium Level in the specialty of violoncello at Havana Municipal Conservatory “Amadeo Roldán”. This same year, after the inauguration of the Instituto Superior de Arte (ISA) and the School of Musicology in the same educational institution, Rolando Pérez began his studies in that area, which was founded by Cuban musicologist Argeliers León,Pérez Chateloin, Roldán “Argeliers el Maestro”; Imparable. Revista Independiente, (National School of Music/UNAM), México DF, 2001. En 1981 after concluding his Studies, Rolando Pérez received the degree of “Licenciado en Música con especialización en Musicología” from the Instituto Superior de Arte (ISA). In 1999, he also received the degree of “Doctor en Ciencias del Arte,” from the same educational institution.http://www.posgrado.unam.mx/musica/div/docentes/personal_docente/perezFernandez.html Work as cellist Rolando Pérez served as cellist in the Cuban National Symphony Orchestra from 1969 to 1981, as well as between 1987 and 1992. He has also participated in ensembles and recordings of concert and popular music such as: Cuarteto de cuerdas by Carlos Malcolm,Música de jóvenes compositores. No. 7, LD 3731, EGREM, Havana 1976. and “El ropavejero,” by Francisco Barrios “El Mastuerzo”,together with the Mexican rock’n roll group “Botellita de Jerez”.Forjando Patria, CD. 743212257328, BMG-Culebra-La-Solitaria, Mexico City1995. Work as musicologist As musicological researcher, Rolando Pérez has collaborated with the “Centro de Investigación y Desarrollo de la Música Cubana” from 1981 to 1987. He has also participated as speaker in numerous congresses and lectures, among which we can mention the following: “Coloquio Interdisciplinario sobre Ritmo, Universidad de Salamanca (1993),” “Encuentro Latinoamericano sobre Religión y Etnicidad, Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá (1996),” “International Conference ‘’Musical Cultures of Latin America: Global Effects, Past and Present,’’ UCLA (1999),” “Society for Ethnomusicology South East and Caribbean Chapter Annual Meeting, FSU, Tallahassee, Florida (2002),” “Congreso Internacional de la Asociación Latinoamericana de Estudios Afroasiáticos, UNAM/Colegio de México, México DF (2003),” “Congreso de la IASPM Rama Latinoamericana, La Habana 2006,” and the “II Congreso Venezolano de Música Popular, Caracas (2006).” Work as professor From 1993 until the present, Rolando Pérez has worked as professor in the area of Ethnomusicology at the National School of Music of the “Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México” (UNAM), where he currently holds a tenure as “Profesor de Tiempo Completo, Titular ‘A’ Interino.” Publications Throughout his long career as musicologist and researcher, Rolando Pérez has published the following books: ‘’La binarización de los ritmos ternarios africanos en América Latina’’ (Casa de las Américas, La Habana, 1987) and ‘’La música afromestiza mexicana’’ (Universidad Veracruzana, Xalapa (Veracruz), 1990). In the first of those books (which won the musicology award from Cuban cultural institution “Casa de las Américas” in 1982),http://www.ecured.cu/index.php/La_binarizaci%C3%B3n_de_los_ritmos_ternarios_africanos_en_Am%C3%A9rica_Latina he proposes a theory which is deeply rooted in the musicological problematic of Latin America and a methodology which could be developed in comparative studies created within the Continent. The text is comprised by three chapters in which the author begins by analyzing general aspects related to the presence of the African population in Latin America, his contributions to music and to the socio-historical context within which those processes have evolved. In the second chapter he describes in detail the characteristics of the African rhythm style and its fusion with the Hispanic style. In the third chapter he develops his own personal conclusions about what he describes as: “the binarization process of the African ternary rhythms”, their specific behavior and the consequences of this process for the cultural development of the musical culture in Cuba and Latin America. His reflections are illustrated with numerous musical examples. In his second book, Pérez Fernández intends to demonstrate the importance of the African contribution to the integration of the music of Mexico, as well as to provide facts that may support, within the musicological field, the conclusions of Mexican anthropologist Gonzalo Aguirre Beltrán in reference to the concept that the Mexican creole music is fundamentally a result of the cultural fusion between the Spanish and the African population.http://www.sic.gob.mx/ficha.php?table=fondo_editorial&table;_id=2363 In addition, this author has written numerous articles and book chapters, not just focused in the African musical contributions in Latino America, but also extending his interest to Linguistics, Epistemology and History, as well as to the contribution of the Chinese musical traditions to the Cuban culture. In those areas of study we should mention works such as: * La corneta china (suona) en Cuba: Una contribución asiática trascendente. “La corneta china (suona) en Cuba: Una contribución asiática trascendente.” Afro-Hispanic Review (Special Issue: Afro-Asia),Volume 27, Number, Spring. 2008. * De China a Cuba: una mirada a su etnomusicología.

The outstanding work of Pérez Fernández constitutes an important point of reference for current and future investigations focusing on the study of the African influence in the music of Latin America. In this regard, his ideas, articles and books have been commented, quoted and reviewed within and outside the American Continent by several prominent researchers such as: Steven Loza, James Robbins, José Jorge de Carvalho, Isabel Aretz, Kofi Agawu, Ángel G.

Background In the early days of oil exploration, drilling was governed by the law of capture, which states that the owner of land on which a well resides has the right to any oil from that well even if it was drained from the land of his neighbors. This provided an incentive for each land owner to extract the oil as fast as possible. Each state tried to regulate its own oil by such measures as proration, the limiting of production to some fraction of capacity; but then two great oil fields, the Oklahoma City Oil Field and the East Texas Oil Field, were discovered. This, along with the Great Depression, led to much waste and very low prices, with a catastrophic effect on the industry. The problems were large enough that the states recognized the need for cooperation. The compact was formed in 1935 as the Interstate Compact to Conserve Gas and Oil.Joint resolution consenting to an interstate oil compact to conserve oil and gas Pub. Res., No. 64 (1935); 74TH CONGRESS. SESS. I. CHS. 780, 781. The purpose of the compact was to eliminate the glut of oil and raise prices for consumers.Leach, Richard H. \\"The Interstate Oil Compact: A Study in Success.\\" Okla. L. Rev. 10 (1957): 274. The interstate compact was seen as an alternative to direct federal regulation that would allow oil producing states to retain more control.Murphy, Blakely M. \\"The Interstate Compact to Conserve Oil and Gas: An Experiement in Co-Operative State Production Control.\\" Miss. LJ 17 (1945): 314. While the National Guard occupied wells in Oklahoma and Texas in 1931-1932, an Oil States Advisory Committee drafted the Thomas-McKeon Bill, which proposed an interstate oil compact and a Federal Interstate Oil Board to recommend quotas. However, the bill was abandoned after oil industry representatives withdrew their support. From 1933 to 1935, oil was regulated under the National Industrial Recovery Act and the Petroleum Code, which in effect left production control in the hands of industry representatives, with no representation for the states. The Supreme Court found these regulations unconstitutional in 1935, and the idea of an interstate compact was revived. On December 3, 1934, Oklahoma Governor- elect E. W. Marland met with the governors of Kansas and Texas to discuss an interstate compact. This led to the drafting of the Interstate Compact to Conserve Oil and Gas, which was ratified by Congress on August 27, 1935. At first, Congress ratified it for only two years at a time, then four years, and finally the compact was made permanent in 1979. Some economic historians have described the regulation of oil output under the compact as an example of a price fixing cartel. The production controls of the IOGCC and the Texas Railroad Commission have been cited as precursors to the establishment of OPEC's caps on member state oil production. The stated purpose of the compact was \\"conserve oil and gas by the prevention of physical waste thereof from any cause\\". States that ratified the compact agreed to enact legislation for this purpose. Article VI of the compact constituted \\"The Interstate Oil Compact Commission,\\" renamed as the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission in 1991, and its duty was to make recommendations for preventing the physical waste of gas and oil. Organizational structure Initially the commission had six members: Colorado, Illinois, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas. It now has 31 member states, 7 associate states and 10 international affiliates (including 7 Canadian provinces and territories). The governor of each member state appoints an official representative who can vote on policy recommendations, and any number of associate representatives who can vote in their place if the official representative is not available. The list of members can be found on the IOGCC website. Many representatives are state regulators overseeing gas and drilling, but as of 2010 at least seven were industry executives and lobbyists. The commission meets biannually, but much of its work occurs in small committee meetings throughout the year. To govern operations, it has steering, finance, resolutions and nominating committees. Other committees are Energy Resources, Research and Technology; Environment and Safety; International; Public Lands; Public Outreach; and State Review. =Transparency and accountability= The IOGCC is governed by the compact and several bylaws. The compact did not provide for any resources to support IOGCC; a later bylaw stipulated that its expenses would be paid \\"from voluntary contributions from the member states and other sources of revenue approved by the Commission\\". These sources, which include federal grants, have proved to be enough to allow the commission to function. IOGCC uses an Oklahoma government email address and domain but it is not a state, not a federal agency and does not have to register to lobby the federal government.DESMOG: Introducing IOGCC: The Most Powerful Oil and Gas Lobby A plethora of information is available but relatively little of it has come directly from the organization itself. IOGCC claims an exemption from the Open Public Records Act and has removed a provision within its by-laws that formerly said its records are open to the public.Energy Wire: Hydraulic Fracturing - Public disclosure database kept privateHuffington Post: IOGCC: The Most Powerful Oil and Gas Lobby You’ve Never Heard Of Activities To identify best practices, IOGCC surveys member states and assesses their activities. It catalogues innovative programs and shares the information with states, and it hosts biannual meetings that draw together representatives from the government, the oil industry and environmentalists. IOGCC is an advocate for states' rights, arguing that state regulation is more effective than \\"one size fits all\\" federal regulation. As well as creating reports, it creates model statutes as a guide for legislation by states. Issues that IOGCC has worked on include national energy policy, carbon sequestration, environmental stewardship, hydraulic fracturing and produced water. =Price fixing= In the 1930s and 1940s, the commission functioned as a price fixing cartel. According to the legal scholar Blakely Murphy, the commission operated under the guise resource conservation but primarily existed to protect the interests of oil producers.Murphy, Blakely M. \\"Administrative Mechanism of the Interstate Compact to Conserve Oil and Gas: The Interstate Oil Compact Commission, 1935-1948.\\" Tul. L. Rev. 22 (1947): 384. =Carbon sequestration= A large part of the human contribution to global warming is from the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) as a result of burning fossil fuels. One way to reduce the contribution is to capture the CO2 before it enters the atmosphere and sequester it by injecting underground in depleted oil and natural gas fields, saline formations and coal beds. Recognizing that the oil and gas industry has a lot of experience with injecting CO2 into the ground for enhanced oil recovery, the IOGCC launched the Geological CO2 Sequestration Task Force in 2002 to investigate the issues surrounding sequestration. A two- phase study was funded by the Department of Energy. Phase I concluded that the states had the knowledge and experience to regulate sequestration safely. In phase II, started in 2006, the task force prepared a report that included a model statute for the states with explanations on how to implement it. =Awards= The IOGCC has three awards. The E. W. Marland Award, established in 1994, recognizes an outstanding state legislator. The Warwick Downing Award, established in 2005, recognizes an individual outside state governments who has made an outstanding contribution to the IOGCC. The highest honor, established in 2001, is the Chairman's Stewardship Award for exemplary efforts in environmental stewardship. This award has four categories: Environmental Partnership (for partnerships with industry led by non-industry organizations); Energy Education; Small Company and Large Company.

Technical and physical properties MSF is a clear, colorless to yellowish hygroscopic liquid (attracts and holds water by absorption or adsorption). It is corrosive and highly toxic. It is an oxydiaphoric inhibitor (acid- transferring inhibitor) of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. MSF, which is a liquid at room temperature, has a vapor pressure of 19.2 mmHg, slightly more volatile than water which has a vapor pressure of 18.8 mmHg at 21 °C. This vapor has an LCt50 (lethal concentration, 50% death rate in a given time) in rats of between 4 and 5 parts per million (ppm) during one hour of exposure or between 1 and 1.2 ppm during 7 hours of exposure. MSF produced no subtle biological effects from direct action of MSF independent of its ability to inhibit cholinesterase. Repeated exposures to 1/10 of the LCt50 did not produce overt systemic toxicity or significant pathology. MSF can also cause severe skin burns and serious eye damage, if contact is made. It is a lachrymator and its vapor causes tears in eyes.MSDS, Fisher Scientific Methanesulfonyl fluoride has a pungent odor. It undergoes decomposition on heating to liberate additional toxic fumes of fluorides and sulfur oxides (SOx). Synthesis A typical synthesis is to treat methanesulfonyl chloride with potassium fluoride or potassium bifluoride in water and then steam distill the product out. Therapeutic study Animal studies have shown that MSF-induced inhibition of AChE is highly selective for the brain when it is studied in vivo. MSF is an irreversible inhibitor of AChE and its inhibition of AChE is only overcome by de novo synthesis of new AChE in each tissue. The recovery of AChE activity in the brain is less than one-tenth as rapid as AChE recovery in the gastrointestinal system, allowing very high accumulated AChE inhibition in the brain with clinically insignificant AChE inhibition in peripheral tissues. The high selectivity of MSF for inhibition in the brain has suggested that it could be used as a treatment for dementia of the Alzheimer type, that it is effective in reducing the persistent cognitive deficit after stroke, and it is highly effective in reducing normal age- related memory impairment, making aged rats perform as well as younger rats. Methanesulfonyl fluoride has been tested successfully in three human clinical trials as a treatment for Alzheimer's dementia. Two Phase I clinical trials testing for safety of MSF in humans at the doses proposed for treating dementia have shown that it is well tolerated and relatively free of the side effects of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea that are produced by the current cholinesterase inhibitors used for the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia. Furthermore, a Phase II, clinical trial testing both the safety and the efficacy of MSF found that it was well tolerated in the aged patients, and it was highly effective in reducing the symptoms of Alzheimer's dementia. US Patent has been issued for the use of MSF for the treatment of dementia.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most recognized form of AGID.  Diagnosis  AGID is diagnosed with a complete medical history, exam of patients motility and with special blood tests looking for autoantibodies consistent with neurologic autoimmunity. Blood tests included evaluations of immunofluorescence (neuronal nuclear and cytoplasmic antibodies), radioimmunoprecipitation assays (neuronal and muscle plasma membrane cation channel antibodies), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (muscle striational antibodies). A finding, along with medical history, of ganglionic neuronal acetylcholine receptor and N-type voltage-gated calcium channel autoantibodies in the blood stream would result in a medically acceptable diagnosis of AGID.  Treatment  Medications to relieve nausea and vomiting or to enhance mobility may be helpful, as may cholinesterase inhibitors. Immunotherapy and plasma exchange have also been reportedly effective. Pyridostigmine is a pharmaceutical treatment option for patients with AGID. In severe cases patients with AGID are required to abandon eating foods, requiring them to get nourishment through a process called parenteral nutrition, where the patient is fed via a permanent IV and the liquid nourishment is infused directly in the blood stream, as opposed to a feeding tube.

He is considered a saint martyr by the Armenian Apostolic Church. Life St. Grigoris' Church in Nughdi, Dagestan, Russia Grigoris was born in Caesaria, Cappadocia and was the grandson of Gregory the Illuminator an originally Parthian Christian missionary who converted the Armenian king to Christianity and became the first official governor of the Armenian Apostolic Church. In addition, both Grigoris' father Vrtanes, and brother Husik, were consecutive catholicoi of Armenia.René Grousset: Histoire de l´Arménie, Payot, Paris, 1973, S. 130. By 325, Christianity in Armenia had gained strength and Armenian religious leaders went on to proselytise the neighbouring states. According to the tenth-century author Movses Kaghankatvatsi, Gregory the Illuminator left Armenia to spread Christianity in Caucasian Albania, where on his orders there was built a church later to become the Amaras Monastery. He then ordained his grandson Grigoris, at the time only 15 years old, to become the patriarch of the Church of Caucasian Albania.P'awstos Byuzand. The Epic Histories Attributed to P'awstos Buzand, English transl. by N. Garsoian, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1983. IV.50; V.12. The growing influence of Christianity and the Armenian Church greatly worried rulers of the neighbouring pagan principalities, who were unwilling to embrace the new religion. According to Faustus Byuzand, when Grigoris arrived in the Caucasian Albanian principality of Massagetae (located along the northeastern shore of the present day Republic of Azerbaijan and south Dagestani shore of the Caspian Sea) to preach Christianity, its ruler Sanatruk (also known as Sanesan) of the local branch of Arsacides ordered him killed. Grigoris was trampled to death by mounted Massagetae soldiers in the Vatnik Valley, near the present-day village of Nughdi 37 kilometres south of Derbent.René Grousset, op. cit.

Early life and education Wang was born in Huixian, Henan Province, in 1957. He attended the Wuhan College of Geology. Wang also obtained a master's degree in economics from Nankai University.  Career  Wang joined the Communist Party of China in March 1984. He began to work in the petroleum industry and was in charge of oil exploration in northeastern Jilin Province, before obtaining his master's degree at Nankai. From July 1999 to September 2001, Wang worked in the Communist Party Committee of Gansu Province as head of the provincial organization department. Wang was transferred to Shanghai in September 2001, and, in April 2003, he was promoted to the position of Deputy Party Secretary of Shanghai. In March 2007, he was transferred to the same position in Beijing, and, in January 2011, he additionally became chairman of the People's Political Consultative Conference of Beijing. In July 2012, Wang's predecessor Guo Jinlong resigned from his position as Mayor of Beijing, and Wang Anshun was appointed mayor in his place. It is not clear how Wang won favour over the years to take on what was evidently the most important mayoralty in China; Wang Qishan and Liu Qi had both held the position, prior to their ascendancy to the Politburo. Initially, Chinese-language media speculated that Wang's candidacy was advocated by Wen Jiabao, with whom Wang shared a background in geology. Wang, who was a relatively youthful 55 at the time of his appointment, seemed destined for the coveted Beijing party chief position. On 28 January 2013, he was duly elected Mayor of Beijing by the Municipal People's Congress. Wang's term lasted just over four years, during which assisted in Beijing's successful bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics. On 30 October 2016, Wang resigned as mayor of Beijing, revealing that he was being transferred to another position. Wang was succeeded by Cai Qi, an ally of Xi Jinping.

The fort became a major base of operations for scouting and punitive expeditions into Abenaki country. Fort Dummer was present-day Vermont's first permanent European settlement, made under the command of Lieutenant Timothy Dwight. On June 18, 1724, Grey Lock attacked a group of men working in a meadow near Hatfield, Massachusetts. Grey Lock retired from the area and killed men at Deerfield, and Northfield over the summer.

Description Iris aucheri grows to tall, with crowded lanceolate (lance-shaped) leaves, producing several flowers in late winter or early spring. The flowers may be white, pale blue or dark blue, with a yellow splash on the falls. It has a violet-like scent. =Biochemistry= As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It has a chromosomal count of 2n = 24. A study in 2014, was carried out on various species of iris DNA, it found that I. iberica subsp. elegantissima had a purity value of 2.80, compared to 1.26 of Iris aucheri. Taxonomy The Latin specific epithet aucheri commemorates the 19th century French botanist Pierre Martin Rémi Aucher-Éloy. It was first described as Xiphion aucheri by Baker and then published as Iris aucheri by Sealy in Kew Bull. page 562 in 1950. There is a known variant Iris aucheri var. fumosa which was published in 2017.

It is situated from Old Dongola, the capital of Makuria. Banganarti was an important Christian pilgrim center; the remains of a substantial medieval church are near the village (18.166736,30.784785).  Excavations  = Polish archaeological research = Polish archaeologists have worked at the site since 1998. Banganarti was included in the field prospection carried out as part of the Southern Dongola Reach Survey, directed by Bogdan Żurawski, after which started the excavations (in 2001). Earlier, from 1984, the site was studied by an expedition from the Royal Ontario Museum. The Polish expedition is organized by the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology University of Warsaw, the Institute of Mediterranean and Oriental Cultures of the Polish Academy of Sciences, and (since 2016) the Institute of Archaeology, University of Rzeszów. It conducts archaeological excavations and conservation and reconstruction works in cooperation with the Sudanese National Corporation for Antiquities and Museums (NCAM). In the first seasons, the work focused on the large church in Banganarti. It consists of two successive buildings, dating respectively to the seventh and the eleventh century. Several burials were discovered inside. Both buildings were decorated with high-quality wall paintings. One of the oldest images of the Virgin Mary has been found in the Lower Church. The younger building, the Upper Church, is called Raphaelion II after its patron, Archangel Raphael. The number ‘II’ was added because Raphael had probably been the patron of the Lower Church as well. The Upper Church functioned from the mid-eleventh to the mid-eighteenth century.Żurawski, Bogdan (2014). Kings and Pilgrims. St Raphael Church II at Banganarti, mid-eleventh to mid-eighteenth century, Warsaw: Wydawnictwo Neriton / IKŚiO PAN. It was a pilgrim center, as attested by almost 1,000 inscriptions left by visitors on the walls of the Raphaelion. They are written in Greek, Old Nubian, or a mixture of both. They mention a few Nubian kings and other prominent persons, such as a queen mother, which gives them historical importance. Wall paintings are among the most important discoveries made in Banganarti. Fifteen were uncovered on the walls of the Lower Church, but they were in much worse condition than the ones decorating the interior of Raphaelion II.Żurawski, Bogdan (2012). St Raphael Church I at Banganarti, mid-sixth to mid-eleventh Century. An introduction to the site and the epoch (=Gdańsk Archaeological Museum African Reports 10), Gdańsk: Gdańsk Archaeological Museum The iconographical program of the Upper Church is undoubtedly rooted in political theology and royal propaganda. Of the 57 preserved wall paintings, 13 were hieratic depictions of a king.Żurawski, Bogdan (2014). Kings and Pilgrims. St Raphael Church II at Banganarti, mid-eleventh to mid-eighteenth century, Warsaw: Wydawnictwo Neriton / IKŚiO PAN Large figurative scenes showing a Nubian king protected by an Archangel surrounded by the Apostles are typical. Biblical scenes and depictions of secular figures (rulers and high dignitaries) are also common. Medieval fortifications built of mudbrick, showing evidence of two fires in the walls’ layers, as well as the remains of a settlement surrounding the sacral buildings, were also studied.

Premiered in 1902, it is an early work by Dohnányi, though his second venture into orchestral writing (the 1896 Symphony in F was not published). Although audibly influenced by the prevailing voices of the time, including Bruckner, Strauss, Tchaikovsky, Wagner, Mahler and Brahms, the work nonetheless demonstrates a formidable handling of complex compositional techniques and is a notable precursor to what would become Dohnányi's distinctive neoromantic style. As with most of his public work, Dohnányi published the composition under the Germanized version of his name, Ernst von Dohnányi. The symphony is 50–55 minutes in duration. Structure The work is structured, uncommonly for Dohnányi's time, in five movements. It opens with the customary fast movement; the next three are in a slow-fast-slow configuration, with two calmer movements on either side of a vigorous scherzo. The finale is the work's longest section, and ends in a triumphant conclusion. The score is marked as follows: #Allegro ma non troppo #Molto adagio #Scherzo - Presto #Intermezzo - Andante con moto #Finale - Introduzione, Tema con variazione e Fuga Orchestration The symphony is written for an orchestra typical of the late-Romantic era: *Woodwinds: piccolo, three flutes, two oboes, English horn, two clarinets, bass clarinet, three bassoons, contrabassoon *Brass: six horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba *Percussion: timpani, cymbals, snare drum, triangle, tambourine, glockenspiel, xylophone *Strings: 16 1st Violins, 10-16 2nd Violins, 8-12 Violas, 10 Cellos, 4 double basses, 2 harps Recordings There have been two major recordings of this symphony, both in 1998. Matthias Bamert, who had two years earlier conducted the premiere recording of Dohnányi's Symphony No. 2, directed a performance with the BBC Philharmonic with Chandos Records label; Leon Botstein conducted the London Philharmonic with Telarc label.

A silicon–oxygen tetrahedron is the SiO4 anionic group, or a silicon atom with four surrounding oxygen atoms arranged to define the corners of a tetrahedron.

A variety of silicate minerals can be identified by the way that the tetrahedra links differ, also by the cations present in the mineral.  Silicon–oxygen tetrahedra links  There are five common silicon–oxygen tetrahedra links: # Independent tetrahedra # Single chains # Double chains # Sheet silicates # Framework silicates = Independent tetrahedra = In this group the tetrahedra don't share any oxygen atoms and are independent. Attraction between the tetrahedra and positive ions holds minerals of this structure together. The positive ions could be metal cations such as iron or magnesium. A common mineral in this group is olivine. = Single chains = Single chain tetrahedra. In single-chain silicates, tetrahedra link to form a chain by sharing two oxygen atoms each. A common mineral in this group is pyroxene. = Double chains = Double chain tetrahedra. Double-chain silicates occur when tetrahedra form a double chain (not always but mostly) by sharing two or three oxygen atoms each. Common minerals for this group are amphiboles. = Sheet silicates = Sheet Silicates. In this group tetrahedra all share three oxygen atoms each and in turn link to form two-dimensional sheets.

In the 1970s the Japanese New Left became known for violent internal splits and terrorism. This caused the movement's influence to wane, although it continued to develop new political ideologies such as . Origins In 1956 Nikita Khrushchev secretly denounced Stalinism in his speech \\"On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences\\". This speech went unreported in official Party organs, so the Stalinist Japanese Communist Party did not offer any reaction. But copies of it circulated around the world and had a great impact on youth and student Communist organizations. In 1957 the Japan Trotskyist League was founded by young dissidents from the Communist Party such as Kuroda Kan'ichi and Ryu Ota, which quickly split into a Fourth International and an \\"post-Trotskyist, anti- Stalinist\\" party called the Revolutionary Communist Party. In 1958 a Maoist group split from the Communist Party advocating violent revolution. In 1959 the Zengakuren, where the violent radicals had concentrated, broke into the Diet of Japan during discussions of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan, eliciting praise from a segment of the Japanese population. It was widely noted that the Old Left had not taken any such extreme measures, and thus the New Left began its ascendance. 1960s In 1963 the Revolutionary Communist League split into the Japan Revolutionary Communist League, National Committee (Middle Core Faction) and the Japan Revolutionary Communist League (Revolutionary Marxist Faction). In 1965 the Socialist Party's Youth Alliance developed a that rejected Trotskyism and advocated for Luxemburgism. In 1968, a global \\"student power\\" movement reached Japan, coinciding with the renewal of the US-Japan Mutual Cooperation Treaty. Many of the New Left factions took the opportunity to occupy university buildings, halt classes, and make demands. They regularly battled against police and each other on campus grounds, donning distinctive colored helmets so that they could recognize fellow members. In 1969, several anarchist groups were revised and formed. In the campus battles these groups wore , along with the \\"nonaligned\\" demonstrators, to demonstrate that they would not rally with any particular group. 1970s The US-Japan Mutual Cooperation Treaty was successfully renewed in 1970 and students returning to work left the New Left groups virtually deserted, with only career leftists remaining. The groups split into dozens of warring factions and internal violence, which had been occasional up until then, grew ever more severe. One of the factions further radicalized into the infamous United Red Army which killed twelve of its own members in self-criticism sessions. The Japanese Red Army which was responsible for Lod Airport massacre and several airport hijackings also formed in 1971. From 1969 to 2003, from 1 to 4 people died every year as the result of internal conflict between New Left groups. Anti- Japaneseism One major intellectual current among the New Left was Anti- Japaneseism, which responded to the Old Left's Anti-Japanism. The Anti- Japanism theory posed that Japan's actions since the Meiji period had been tainted by imperialism, and a new regime was needed. Anti-Japaneseism radicalized this argument by claiming that the Japanese themselves are evil and all traces of Japaneseness must be purged from the \\"Japanese\\" archipelago. Proponents of this theory believe that the only way to redeem oneself from the \\"oppressor and criminal Japanese race\\" is to fight against all Japanese interests.治安フォーラム別冊『過激派事件簿40年史』立花書房、2001年 Anti-Japaneseism has been compared to anti-Semitism except that it is argued by members of the ethnic groups themselves.

It is a bulbous herbaceous perennial, from temperate Asia, within Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. It has long blue green leaves, many flowers in spring, in shades of yellow and white. Description Iris bucharica has a yellowish white bulb, about 2 cm in diameter, with thin fleshy roots.James Cullen, Sabina G. Knees, H. Suzanne Cubey (Editors) It grows high. The lanceolate (lance-like) leaves which are blue-green below and glossy green above, reach up to wide and long. They are scattered up the flower stems. Each stem produces up to seven unscented flowers in spring. They bloom in order from the top of the stem, going downwards. The perianth tube is about long. Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The flowers have white or creamy white standards with yellow falls. The falls sometimes have brown markings and a deep yellow crest. The flowers are about across. Pure yellow forms are occasionally wrongly labelled as I. orchioides (a different species). The stigmas are semicircular, with whitish anthers and pollen. Iris bucharica, Iris orchioides and Iris warleyensis all have cubiform seeds. =Biochemistry= Most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes. This can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings.} Taxonomy It is commonly known as 'Bukhara iris', 'corn leaf Iris', or 'horned iris'. It is pronounced 'bukh-AR-ee-kuh' and named after the city of Bukhara in Uzbekistan.John Weathers Iris bucharica was illustrated in Curtis's Botanical Magazine, Tab. 7111 on 1 April 1890, and was incorrectly described by Baker as a specimen of Iris orchioides. It was then published as Iris bucharica in The Gardeners' Chronicle by Foster in 1902. Michael Foster got the bulbs from the UK bulb merchant Van Tubergen (mainly based in Harlem, Netherlands). It was also published in “Flora and Sylva” in 1905. It was then introduced into the UK in 1902. It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 4 April 2003, then updated on 1 December 2004. Distribution and habitat Iris bucharica is native to temperate Central Asia. in north-eastern Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan around Bukhara. It is endemic to the Gissar Range, in the valleys of Surkhan-darya, Kafirnigan, Vakhsh, Ak-su and Kizyl-su rivers. It is found at , in pebble beds and gravelly slopes of the lower mountain zone. Cultivation Iris bucharica is widely cultivated in temperate regions, and in the UK it has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. It prefers free draining fertile soils which are neutral or slightly alkaline. The bulbs are planted in late summer or autumn, deep, in gravelly soils in full sun. Like others of its kind it needs a period of warmth and dryness during the summer, to prevent the fleshy roots from rotting away. This is normally after the foliage dies back in late June or early July. It is hardy to USDA Zones 4-9. It is hardy in most areas of the UK, down to . But it can be grown in a pot in a greenhouse, providing it is kept dry in summer and left out in the autumn rains. It will increase by bulblets, naturalising quickly where growing conditions are favourable, allowing for the creation of drifts in borders or rock gardens. Plants may be lifted and divided every 3–4 years, to prevent overcrowding. It is also possible to grow from seed, but it will take several years before the bulbs are big enough to produce flowers. Iris orchioides hybridizes freely with I. bucharica to create a large golden- flowered hybrid. It is deer resistant. =Cultivars= * Iris 'Sunny Side Up': a hybrid of Iris bucharica and Iris magnifica, this cultivar has yellow and white flowers.

From the viewpoint of \\"Anti-Japan\\" such as Ainu Revolution Theory, it claims that \\"The nation called Japan and the entire Japanese race should be extinguished from the face of the earth\\". The Anti- Japanism theory goes far back in history, denying the founding of Japan and the history of the Japanese people, it advocates for the extermination of the Japanese ethnicity. Differences from Anti-Japanism The Anti-Japanism theory posed that Japan's actions since the Meiji period had been tainted by imperialism, and a new regime was needed. According to Anti-Japanism, Japan's moral failure can be redeemed if the Imperial family is purged and the country forcibly transitions into a communist \\"people's republic\\".

East Asia Anti-Japan Armed Front member Yoshimasa Kurosawa affirms that he is not opposed to any particular Japanese political regime, but to the existence of Japan itself. Strategy to extinguish Japanese ethnicity The East Asia Anti-Japan Armed Front has suggested a scenario which could lead to the ruin of Japan. In this scenario they would invade South Korea and topple the current \\"pro-Japanese\\" regime, replacing it with a military regime that is openly anti-Japanese. Japan, owing to its naturally aggressive nature, would invade Korea in response, then the Anti-Japaneseists could employ their terrorist networks to wreak havoc in Korea similar to the Vietnam War, draining Japan's financial and political strength, which would allow its swift downfall. The detail scenario is as following : The country that triggers this is the Republic of Korea. First of all, by fostering xenophobic South Korean nationalism, it fuels anti-Japanese sentiment, induces a coup d'etat in the South Korean military, overthrows the “Pro-Japanese government”, and eliminates the “Pro-Japanese” sentiments that are rooted in South Korea. Then, the South Korean \\"Anti-Japanese military government\\" declares war on Japan, kills at least 100,000 Japanese Self Defence Forces personnel.竹中労・平岡正明『水滸伝- 窮民革命のための序説』より梅内恒夫「共産同赤軍派より日帝打倒を志すすべての人々へ」三一書房、1973年 太田竜『辺境最深部に向かって退却せよ!』三一書房、1971年 At the same time, in Okinawa, the “Ryukyu Republic” declares independence.

Early life and education Grabauskas was born in Worcester, Massachusetts. He is the eldest of four children (sisters Lisa, Karen, and brother David). His father, Drasutis Antanas \\"Tony\\" Grabauskas, was a native of Lithuania who emigrated to the United States with his parents in 1949 and died in 2010. His mother, Patricia (Sheehan) Grabauskas-Caruso, is a native of Milbury, Massachusetts. Grabauskas grew up in the Central Massachusetts towns of Sutton and Auburn. He attended St. John's High School, received his BA from the College of the Holy Cross and his MBA from Cornell University's Johnson School of Management. Early career Grabauskas began his government career in 1987 on the staff of Massachusetts State Senator Mary L. Padula (R-Lunenburg) and soon became her chief of staff. After Padula's appointment as Massachusetts Secretary of the Executive Office of Communities and Development (EOCD) in 1991, he briefly worked as chief of staff for State Senator Richard Tisei (R-Wakefield) before joining Padula as a Deputy Secretary of EOCD from 1991 to 1995. He then served as the chief of staff to the Massachusetts Secretary of Health and Human Services. From 1995 to 1996 Grabauskas lived and worked in Lithuania as the resident program officer for the nonprofit International Republican Institute. In 1997 he became chief of staff in the Massachusetts Department of Economic Development. From 1998 to 1999, Grabauskas served as the state's Director of Consumer Affairs under Gov. Paul Cellucci. Registrar of Motor Vehicles From 1999 to 2002, Grabauskas served as Massachusetts' Registrar of Motor Vehicles. At the time of his appointment, the agency was described by the Boston Globe as \\"plagued with long lines and charges of mismanagement\\" and was considered a political liability after series of articles in the Lawrence Eagle-Tribune detailed the interminable waits at the Registry. During his tenure as Registrar, Grabauskas was able to reduce the average wait time at the agency from an hour and fifteen minutes to less than ten minutes. He also instituted the use of the Q-Matic queuing system, which allows customers to view their estimated wait times on customized tickets or online. In addition, the number of online transaction available to the public was greatly expanded, with online transactions rising from about 30,000 in 1999 to over 500,000 in 2002. Campaign for State Treasurer In January 2002, Grabauskas resigned as Registrar to run for Treasurer of Massachusetts. He defeated Bruce A. Herzfelder in the Republican primary 53% to 47%. He lost in the general election to Democrat Tim Cahill 51% to 41%. Secretary of Transportation Savin Hill station as Secretary of Transportation in 2005 After that loss, Governor-elect Mitt Romney named Grabauskas to his cabinet as Secretary of Transportation and Construction. He also served as a member of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority board. During his tenure as Transportation Secretary, the department employed a \\"fix it first\\" strategy\\" which prioritized repairs to existing infrastructure over the construction of new ones. He oversaw the introduction of the first statewide 20-year transportation plan. The plan directed that at least 75 percent of all new capital spending be focused toward maintaining and improving the state's existing transportation network with these funds dedicated to bridge repair, highway reconstruction, de-bottlenecking, intersection and interchange modernization and ensuring a transit system that is in a state of good repair. The plan also included limited transit expansions, prioritizing projects that earn federal dollars, win community support and encourage local contribution. MBTA General Manager In 2005, Grabauskas resigned his position as Transportation Secretary to become General Manager of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). During his four-plus years as General Manager, the MBTA switched its payment method from tokens to the CharlieCard, construction on the Greenbush Line was completed, and WiFi service was installed on commuter rail trains and boats. In 2009, the MBTA bought out the remainder of Grabauskas' contract, citing the Authority's continuing financial problems, customer service complaints, and Grabauskas' handling of two subway accidents. Grabauskas' ouster, which was engineered by Governor Deval Patrick and Transportation Secretary James Aloisi, was criticized by the state Republican Party, who believed that the Republican-appointed Grabauskas was being used as a scapegoat. It was also criticized by Democrats Thomas Menino and Steven Baddour, with the latter describing it as \\"trying to settle a political score at taxpayers' expense\\". After his departure, Grabauskas served as a senior fellow for public policy at MassINC and as chairman and senior strategic adviser of the Bronner Center for Transportation Management. Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation In March 2012 Grabauskas was named Executive Director and CEO of the Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation (HART) after he and the HART board of directors agreed on a three-year contract that includes an annual base salary of $245,000, a $36,000 a year housing allowance, a transportation allowance of $6,000 a year, and a potential $35,000 annual performance bonus. HART oversees the Honolulu High- Capacity Transit Corridor Project, the largest public works project in the history of the state of Hawaii. The project, scheduled to open in 2019, is a $9.2 billion, 20-mile long automated rail system that plans to operate a fleet of 80 rail cars and an infrastructure of 21 stations, a 43-acre maintenance and storage facility, three park-and-ride lots, and one park-and-ride structure. Grabauskas resigned from HART in August 2016. HART Board of Directors member Michael D. Formby was named as interim director.

It was fought between the royalist forces loyal to the Spanish crown, commanded by General Antonio Pío González-Saravia Mollinedo, and the Mexican insurgents fighting for independence from the Spanish Empire, commanded by José María Morelos y Pavón. The battle resulted in a victory for the Mexican insurgents.  Context  José María Morelos was in Tehuacán, Puebla, he discovered that loyalist Spanish troops were en route to attack him. He decided to regroup his forces and abandon Tehuacán. The organization of the insurgent army under Morelos was under the following of his generals; Hermenegildo Galeana, Víctor Bravo Miguel Bravo, Nicolás Bravo, Juan Pablo Galeana de los Ríos, Mariano Matamoros y Guridi, and his colonels; Vicente Ramón Guerrero Saldaña (future president of Mexico), and José Miguel Ramón Adaucto Fernández y Félix. All of his forces were able to join together creating an army of over 5,000 soldiers and 40 pieces of artillery. This army proceeded to march to Oaxaca on 10 November 1812.Zárate, 1880; 326 Before departing for Oaxaca, Morelos named the substitute for Leonardo Bravo who had fallen prisoner to royalist troops. He decided to promote Mariano Matamoros to Bravo's former position, naming him marshal of the army and Morelos' direct second in command, having to take control of insurgent forces in the event of Morelos' capture or killing. After his arrival at Villa de Etla, Oaxaca, Morelos developed a plan to attack the state capital at Oaxaca. He sent an ultimatum to the Spanish defender of the city, General González Saravia asking for his immediate surrender. The message went unanswered and Morelos decided to take the city by force. The battle On 25 November 1812, the insurgent forces took position and began their assault. Colonel Manuel Montaño marched up the surrounding mountainside to the Cerro de la Soledad to cut the town's water supply and to impede any retreat in that direction by way of Santo Domingo Tehuantepec. General Hermenegildo Galeana took command of the vanguard; Miguel Bravo took command of the center column; Mariano Matamoros y Guridi commanded the rearguard. For his part, Morelos himself commanded a section of cavalry. A good portion of the infantry remained in reserve to be used if necessary later in the battle. The fort at Cerro de la Soledad, which was at that time in Spanish loyalist control, was able to check the main advance for some time with its artillery cover barrages. Morelos, thinking that his position was unfavorable for attack, sent the colonels Ramón Sesma and Manuel de Mier y Terán to take the fort on the mountain. They attempted to move a cannon close to the fort to assist in their attack but soon discovered that they were under heavy fire from two sides and abandoned the gun. Morelos thereafter decided to simply reinforce the main advance by Mier and Terán until their objective was at last completed.Zárate, 1880; 327-329 Once that position had been taken by the insurgents, the main attack on Oaxaca began supported by an eight-pound cannon. The royalist troops initially returned fire but as the battle progressed, they were unable to sustain the firepower until the town's defender ordered a retreat. The last skirmish, referred to as the Juego de Pelota (literally: ball game), was the taking of a fortified position that was surrounded by a moat and trenches. Insurgent forces were initially hesitant to advance on the well fortified position until Guadalupe Victoria hurled his sword across the pit exclaiming - ¡va mi espada en prenda, voy por ella! (There goes my sword, I will go and get it!). Swimming across the moat, he incited his comrades to follow him, eventually taking the position successfully. The loss of Oaxaca was a significant strategic victory for the insurgents and a severe setback for the Viceroyalty of New Spain. For the insurgents, it signified the military prestige and prowess of Morelos as an effective battle commander and gave the insurgents a viable geographic position from which to control the surrounding area.

More specifically, he was the second highest leader of Hamas only after Sheikh Ahmed Yassin. He was also the political leader of Hamas, who argued strongly against suicide bombings and in favor of a long-term truce. Early life and education Shanab was born in the central Gaza refugee camp of Nuseirat in 1950. His family was originally from the village of Al Jayyeh, a village near Ashkelon and Yubna. The family was expelled from the village and came the refugee camp in 1948. He graduated from high school in 1966 and was accepted at then newly opened Bir Zeit University in the West Bank. However, due to the 1967-Arab-Israeli War and Israel's subsequent occupation, he could not attend the university. In 1972, he managed to go to Egypt to receive university education. He obtained a bachelor of science degree in civil engineering from Mansoura University in Cairo. After working four years in Gaza city, Shanab went to the US and obtained a master of science degree in civil engineering from Colorado State University. Career and activities Shanab returned to Gaza city in 1977 after completing his undergraduate studies and he worked at the municipal council until 1981. Following the completion of graduate studies in the US Shanab began to work as an instructor in engineering at Gaza Islamic University. During this period, Shanab met with the Hamas founder Ahmed Yassin, Ibrahim Magadmeh and the Islamic Jihad founder Fathi Shiqaqi, and eventually, he joined Hamas. He was imprisoned in 1989 for his involvement in founding Hamas and being a deputy to Ahmed Yassin. On the other hand, Israel press statement argued that Shanab was detained since he had admitted to have participated in planning and carrying out the kidnapping and murder of an Israeli soldier, Ilan Sa'adon. He improved his religious knowledge base during his time in prison. Shanab was freed in late 1996. He was in a solitary cell underground for two years during his imprisonment. After his release, he was elected as the head of the Palestinian Engineers Association on the list of Hamas in 1997. In November 1998, Palestinian police arrested Shanab and other top Hamas leaders, including Mahmoud Al Zahar, Ismail Haniyya and Ahmed Baher. Then Shanab began to serve as Hamas observer in the Central Council of the Palestinian Liberation Organization. He also became one of the spokespersons of the Hamas' political wing in Gaza. However, his role as spokesperson was not ordinary in that he was Hamas's most visible spokesperson in the western media. After suicide bombings killed 25 people in Israel in 2001, Palestinian police arrested Shanab and Haniya among the others in December 2001. Shanab participated in the 2002 and 2003 peace talks as a Hamas representative. He also functioned as Hamas's link to Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas when Abbas was trying to persuade militant groups to stop attacking Israelis. Shanab was one of the supporters of ceasefire declared by armed Palestinian groups including Hamas and Islamic Jihad on 29 June 2003. The ceasefire was unilateral, called hudna in Arabic. Shanab was the third-in-command in Hamas, behind late Abdulaziz Rantisi and Mahmud Zahar and in front of Ismail Haniyeh before his assassination in August 2003. =Views= Abu Shanab represented the Hamas's more moderate and pragmatic side, although he was subject to Yassin's leadership and committed to Hamas ideology. Unlike Yassin, he supported a long-term ceasefire with Israel and a two-state solution. On the other hand, he argued that group decision is better than individual decision, even though the individual is right. Although he did not advocated suicide bombing attacks, he stated that it was a primitive weapon and added \\"But, it’s all we have and it’s less harmful than F-16s loaded with tons of explosives.\\" Personal life Shanab was married and had nine children, five daughters and four sons. His eldest son Hassan studied computer engineering in the US and his youngest son, Mesk, was two-years-old when Shanab was killed. As of 2012 his son Hamza (born 1984) headed the Palestinian Assembly for Supporting the Syrian Revolution, a nongovernmental organization. Shanab lived in the community of Eshaikh Radhwan, north of Gaza City. He had good command of English. Assassination On 21 August 2003, Shanab and his two bodyguards were hit and killed by an Israeli helicopter missile strike while travelling by car in Rimal neighborhood of Gaza City. In the attack, an Apache helicopter fired three or four missiles at the car. The assassination occurred in retaliation for the suicide bombing of a Jerusalem bus on 19 August 2003, killing twenty mostly orthodox Jews, including six children. Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement after the assassination and described Shanab as a senior terrorist and Hamas operative. The major consequence of his assassination was that the three-month ceasefire that had been declared on 29 June 2003 was terminated by Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades two days after the assassination, on 23 August 2003. The other consequence was that Hamas continued its suicide attacks that had been stopped for a while. =Funeral= Nearly 100,000 people attended the funeral ceremony for Shanab held in Gaza City on 22 August 2003.

This mountain forms a prominent and easily visible landmark between mile markers 43 and 51 of the Richardson Highway, as the highway passes just to its west between Tonsina and the Thompson Pass (see photograph). Mount Billy Mitchell was named for William \\"Billy\\" Mitchell (18791936), a brigadier general of the United States Army Air Service who is often referred to as the \\"father of the United States Air Force\\". Naming Historical marker placed by the Alaska Department of Transportation & Public Facilities along the Richardson Highway, just south of mile marker 48 In response to the Klondike Gold Rush, the United States Army established numerous military outposts throughout the District of Alaska. As a lieutenant in the United States Army Signal Corps, Mitchell was stationed in Alaska at that time. On May 26, 1900, the United States Congress appropriated $450,000 in order to establish a communications system to connect the many isolated and widely separated U.S. Army outposts and civilian Gold Rush camps in Alaska by telegraph. Along with Captain George C. Brunnell, Lieutenant Mitchell oversaw the construction of what became known as the Washington-Alaska Military Cable and Telegraph System (WAMCATS). Construction of the WAMCATS system began in the summer of 1900. Stretching from Fort Liscum at Valdez in Southcentral Alaska to Fort Egbert at Eagle on the Canada–United States border to Fort St. Michael to Nome on the Seward Peninsula, construction crews completed the final overland connection south of Fairbanks on June 27, 1903. By the time WAMCATS was fully operational in 1904, the system included almost of overland telegraph cable, over of submarine communications cable, and a wireless telegraphy system crossing the Norton Sound to Nome. This telegraph line was the first to link American outposts in Eagle, Valdez and Nome with each other as well as to Washington, D.C. in the contiguous United States. Among the greatest logistical and technological achievements of its day, the WAMCATS included the first successful long- distance radio operation in the world. A historical marker is located at a roadside highway turnout just north of where the Richardson Highway crosses the Tiekel River. Placed by the Alaska Department of Transportation & Public Facilities, the text reads (see photograph): Glaciers The climate of the Chugach Mountains is strongly influenced by its location close to Prince William Sound and especially the Gulf of Alaska. The Gulf of Alaska generates powerful winter storms which drive heavy precipitation northwards into southern and Southcentral Alaska, including the Chugach Mountains. More snow falls in the vicinity of Valdez—an average annual snowfall of —than in any other location in the United States. Over thousands of years, this snow has accumulated to form glaciers on Mount Billy Mitchell, especially on its north face, which is its leeward side. Despite this long-term glaciation and even in the face of continuing heavy snowfall (the winter of 2011-2012 saw record snowfall in this area), the rate of ablation has exceeded the rate of accumulation over the past few decades. Because of this, Mount Billy Mitchell's glaciers have retreated significantly in recent years.

The game uses the story and characters from the American series Wacky Races created by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. The eleven racing cars compete against each other on twenty circuits in a very cartoonish spirit, using the cel-shading technique in the three-dimensional versions.  Gameplay  Each vehicle has its own characteristics, strengths and weaknesses, resulting in a wide variety of driving styles. For example, the Tocard tank driven by Sergeant Grosse-Pomme and Private Petit-Pois has low acceleration but high top speed. The Malabar et Malabille Casse-cou, meanwhile, has a medium top speed but very good handling. As in Mario Kart, each competitor has gadgets and weapons to fight their way for first place (such as chewing gum, exploding pumpkins or firecrackers). The player must accumulate dingo tokens scattered around the circuit in order to use the vehicle's specific gadgets. These bonuses are divided into three categories: defense, speed and attack. At the end of the championship mode for the first time, the player has access to vehicle No. 00 owned by Dick Dastardly and Muttley, with superior features. The game has four game modes: Time Trial, Championship, Multiplayer, and Super Gadgets. The latter offers a detailed list of all the devices available in the game.  Reception  Wacky Races received mixed reviews, scoring 64/100 on Metacritic on its PC version, while MobyGames shows various reviews for the different versions of the game. IGN cites the Dreamcast version as «above average» and «easy enough to appeal to younger gamers», while for the Game Boy Color version, he called the game engine a «bravado», praising the feeling of speed, giving the Dreamcast version a rating of 84/100, and a rating of 80/100 to the Game Boy Color version. The Meristation reviewer José Javier Méndez cites the Dreamcast vesion as a game that «meets expectations», praising its graphics and humor, giving it a 7.5/10 rating; Alberto Mendoza comments about the PC version in the same way as Méndez, but criticizing its gameplay, giving a rating of 7.2/10. Gamezilla cites the Dreamcast version as a game with «great controls, bright and crisp graphics and sound», praising the «variety of racing styles, challenges and vehicles», rating it a 91/100. A less enthusiastic review comes from The Video Game Critic, which cites it as a «generic» racing game, but praises the cel-shading graphics and recognizable characters from Hanna- Barbera, rating it 25/100.

It was produced by conversion of a Ryan Navion to replace its single engine with two wing-mounted engines. It is commonly known as the Twin Navion, although that name is also often applied to a later similar conversion, the Camair 480. Background The project began in 1951 as a requirement by Charles Daubenberger for an inexpensive replacement for the corporate Ryan Navion operated by his Dauby Equipment Company, to achieve better reliability while crossing high mountain ranges. He commissioned Roger Keeney of the Acme Aircraft Company to provide a solution, that evolved into a twin engine conversion of a Navion.twinnavion.com Design and development Jack Riley Sr. built the first model with a team of four. With encouragement from Lycoming, the 125 hp Lycoming O-290 four-cylinder engine was selected for the project. Design changes from the basic Navion structure included strengthened wing spars, that supported engine mounts and other components from Piper PA-18 Super Cub, plus new engine nacelles, a faired nose section that replaced the existing engine and cowling, and a new vertical tail and rudder based on the existing horizontal stabilizer. During testing in 1952, the aircraft was initially named the X-16 Bi-Navion. On 10 November 1952, it was granted certification by the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA), after which it was renamed as the D-16 Twin Navion.Simpson 2001 A second aircraft was converted for Jack Riley, who specified 140 hp engines, and he purchased the production rights from Dauby. Riley Aircraft then started production of the Riley D-16 Twin Navion, that standardized the design with 150 hp Lycoming O-320 engines and other improvements. In March 1953, after 19 conversions had been carried out, Riley subcontracted production to Temco Aircraft. Temco then purchased the sole production rights, and produced a further 46 conversions under the name Temco D-16. In September 1954, the design was upgraded to include 170 hp Lycoming O-340 engines plus increased fuel capacity in wingtip tanks, officially named Temco D-16A but typically marketed as the Riley 55 for the 1955 model year.Simpson 1995Flight, 5 February 1954, p. 166Flight, 14 January 1955, p. 52 Operational history In 1957, after 45 conversions to D-16A specification, production ceased in the face of competition from more cost-effective new-build types such as the Piper PA-23 Apache. Many of the D-16 models were upgraded to D-16A standards. In 2012, about 52 Temco D-16 and D-16A models remain on the US civil aircraft register, and at least three are preserved in museum collections.Simpson 2001Simpson 1995Ogden 2007 Specifications (D-16)  See also References ;Notes ;Bibliography *FAA Specification 2A1 Rev 5 *Ogden, Bob. 2007.

Retrieved 2 July 2013Demographic change and Assam violence . The Pioneer. The first incident was reported to have taken place on 20 July 2012. As of 8 August 2012, 77 people had died and over 400,000 people were taking shelter in 270 relief camps, after being displaced from almost 400 villages. Eleven people have been reported missing. On 27 July 2012, Assam's Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi blamed the UPA led national government for a \\"delay in army deployment to riot-hit areas\\". The next day, Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh visited the relief camps in Kokrajhar and called the recent violence a blot on the face of India. Indian Home Minister P. Chidambaram visited the state on Monday, 30 July to review the security situation and the relief and rehabilitation measures being taken. Lok Sabha member from Kokrajhar, Sansuma Khunggur Bwiswmuthiary blamed illegal immigration for the violence in the state. The Election Commissioner of India, H.S. Brahma, said that of the 27 districts in Assam, 11 of them will be shown to have a Muslim majority when the 2011 census figures are published. Singh was criticised for not dealing with the flood of illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. A journalist had asserted that the flooding of illegal immigrants from Bangladesh was a myth. The violence and exodus of thousands of people from Northeast India reportedly led to a series of incessant protests in Assam, at multiple locations, during the months of August–September. The protesters' main demand was expeditious detection and deportation of illegal infiltrators from Assam. On 15 September, at a convention of non-political indigenous ethnic groups, organisations representing some tribes Bodo, Dimasa, Tiwa, Deuri, Karbi, Garo, Rabha, Sonowal Kacharis and other indigenous communities decided to form a coordination committee for the cause. The tribal leaders said that illegal immigration has threatened the existence, right to land and resources to all indigenous people of the entire state, and it was not limited to BTAD alone. Background The violence in 2012 followed ethnic tensions between the indigenous Bodo people and illegal immigrant Bengali-speaking Muslims. While the Bengali-speaking Muslims state that they are descendants of East Bengali Muslims brought to Assam during the British Raj, local indigenous communities allege that the Muslim population has increased, boosted by refugees from the erstwhile East Pakistan before the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 and by subsequent illegal migrants from Bangladesh. By the mid-1970s, increased competition for livelihood, land and political power led to frequent incidents of violence, including the Nellie massacre after the controversial 1983 state elections, which left nearly 3,000 dead, and other large scale clashes. These incidents resulted in resentment directed at India's central government, not only from Bodos, Rabhas, Tiwas, Keot(Kaibarta) and other indigenous ethnic groups for failing to prevent illegal migration, but also from the indigenous Assamese Muslim community for failing to protect the rights of minorities. In 1998, Srinivas Kumar Sinha, who then was governor of Assam, had sent a report to then Indian President, KR Narayanan, explaining about the problems that the unchecked illegal immigration of Bangladeshis would bring to the integrity of India.Assam riots: Fruits of living in denial over Bangladesh influx. Firstpost. 25 June 2012. Retrieved 2 July 2013 In that report, he had highlighted the history that Assam was first claimed by Pakistan during 1947 and then by Bangladesh, due to its rich natural resources. The report raised worries about what might happen if the illegal immigrants gain majority and ask for secession from India. He also cited the \\"Greater Bangladesh project\\" which might entice the immigrants to merge those regions of Assam with Bangladesh Riots in Kokrajhar, Chirang Ethnic tensions between Bodos and Bengali-speaking Muslims escalated into a riot in Kokrajhar on 20 July 2012, when unidentified miscreants killed four Bodo youths at Joypur. This was followed by retaliatory attacks on local Muslims killing two and injuring several of them on the morning of 21 July 2012. Almost 80 people were killed, most of whom were Bengali Muslims and some Bodos. 400,000 people were displaced to migrant camps, most being Muslims . The Indian army was deployed amid curfews to stem the mob rioting, with permission to shoot on sight. Around 500 villages had been destroyed through arson. Central government response On the request of Sansuma Khunggur Bwiswmuthiary, MP of Kokrajhar, the Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh called the Chief Minister of Assam, Tarun Gogoi, on 23 July 2012 and instructed him to do whatever was necessary to restore peace. The violence continued despite the efforts of the state law enforcement agencies, and on 24 July 2012, India's central government deployed paramilitary forces and 13 columns of the Indian Army to the affected districts. On the same day, shoot-on-sight orders and an indefinite curfew were enforced across Kokrajhar district, which also led to the death of four people when police fired at violent crowds in the Rampur and Chaparkata areas of Kokrajhar. The Army conducted flag marches and the disrupted rail services were resumed on 25 July 2012, under the protection of the central forces. Union Home Secretary R.K. Singh stated that there were signs of improvement and called upon the Assam government to immediately act against the \\"ring leaders\\" of both factions. On 26 July, an indefinite curfew and the shoot-on- sight orders were enforced in Kokrajhar district, along with a night curfew in Chirang and Dhubri districts. On 26 July, the state's chief minister, Tarun Gogoi, announced the payment of ₹ 600,000 as compensation to the next of kin of the dead. Gogoi also announced that the people who were rendered homeless or displaced would be provided new houses at government expense. The chief minister assured the population that peace would soon return to the violence- affected areas. Singh visited the district of Kokrajhar to observe the situation on 28 July 2012 and offered support to the victims. The prime minister said that the Centre will \\"closely work with the state government to provide a sense of security to all affected areas to ensure that they can go back to their houses secure in the knowledge that their lives and livelihood are secure\\". Singh said ₹ 200,000 would be given to the next of kin of those who died and ₹ 50,000 to the injured. He announced ₹ 1 billion for relief and rehabilitation of the affected people in the six affected districts, ₹ 1 billion as Special Plan assistance for development programs in the affected areas and another ₹ 1 billion under the Indira Awaas Yojana. ₹ 30,000 each would be given to those whose houses were totally destroyed, ₹ 20,000 under the Prime Minister's National Relief Fund to those whose houses were partially damaged. The prime minister ordered an inquiry committee to be set up to look into the violence, and directed the state government to provide security so that the affected people can return home. On 28 July, Gogoi said that the late arrival of central forces, including the Army, assisted the spread of clashes in the state. According to the media reports, the Army was initially reluctant to deploy the troops and wanted clarification from the Defence Ministry on deployment because the situation \\"seemed to have communal overtones\\". When the situation deteriorated rapidly and another request was made, the ministry authorised Army deployment on 25 July 2012. The Centre has authorized the Assam government to deploy more than 11,000 paramilitary personnel in the state's violence-hit districts and has dispatched a relief plane with medical teams and supplies. Central paramilitary forces are now out in full force in Assam; the deployment of 65 paramilitary companies has been ordered and 53 companies have reached Assam. Of these, five were sent on the night of 20 July. 7,300 paramilitary personnel were deployed in strife-torn Kokrajhar, Chirang and Dhubri districts after moving them from other states in the wake of clashes between Bodos and Bengali-speaking Muslims. AIUDF leader Badruddin Ajmal claimed that the state administration was complicit in the violence and demanded a CBI inquiry into the riots. Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi, recommended a CBI probe into the clashes in BTAD and Dubri districts and claimed \\"internal and external forces were at work\\". On 7 August 2012, the Centre ordered CBI probe into the continued ethnic clashes in the state. According to the Times of India, some 14 Muslim groups which came into existence in the last 20 years are under observation by intelligence agencies after inputs suggested that their activities were \\"inimical to peace and social harmony\\". The organizations named are Muslim Security Council of Assam, United Liberation Militia of Assam, Islamic Liberation Army of Assam, Muslim Volunteer Force, Muslim Liberation Army, Muslim Security Force, Islamic Sevak Sangh and Islamic United Reformation Protest of India. =Criticism of the response= The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and some senior Indian officials are said to have questioned whether the deployment of the Indian Army to curb the outbreak of violence was enacted fast enough.Sudhi Ranjan Sen Assam violence: Was the Army deployed too late? Home ministry to take up the issue with the Prime Minister NDTV. CBI investigation On 7 August 2012, the Govt of India ordered CBI probe of the matter. CBI on 19 September 2012, carried out first arrests by arresting five youths in connection with alleged lynching of four former Bodo youths in Kokrajhar area on 20 July. BPPF MLA Pradip Brahma was arrested along with Mohammed Hashem Ali, Mohammed Adom Ali Sheikh, Mohammed Hashim Ali Rehman, Mohammed Qurban Ali Sheikh, Mohammed Imran Hussain. They were arrested after they allegedly confessed of their involvement. Further investigation able to catch real culprit behind 2012 ethnic clash, has named an Assam Police Constable Mohibur Islam alias Ratul who is on run at present. Repercussions in other parts of India =Maharashtra= =Pune= On 8 and 9 August, some Meiteis were attacked in Pune. Students and professionals were beaten up by Muslims allegedly in Pune's Kondhwa and Poona College areas. Attackers asked victims which state they belonged to, and those who replied Manipur were beaten. One of the victims said some attackers wore college uniform while others were in casual clothes. Police arrested nine Muslim youths for the attacks. =Mumbai= On 11 August 2012, a Muslim protest against the riots in Assam and attacks on Muslims in Burma was held at Azad Maidan in Mumbai. The protest was organised by Raza Academy, and was attended by two other groups, Sunni Jamiatul Ulma and Jama'at-e- Raza-e-Mustafa. It ended in violence; two were killed and 54 others injured, including 45 policemen. Police Commissioner Arup Patnaik said it was around 3 pm that the crowd turned violent, after some protesters displayed \\"provocative photos\\" of the Assam violence. \\"Some people started raising slogans against the police and media. They set fire to police vehicles,\\" said Patnaik. \\"As we tried restraining the crowd, a scuffle broke out between the protestors and police.\\" The Mumbai Police Crime Branch suspects that the riot situation outside Azad Maidan was part of a \\"big conspiracy\\". Crime Branch sources said the police are probing the alleged role of \\"outside agencies\\". Crime Branch officers said the police felt that the violence may have been pre-planned as the protestors were equipped with gear to torch vehicles, which they used to set fire to three media outdoor broadcasting (OB) vans and four police vans, one of which belonged to the riot control police. They also damaged several other vehicles, including BEST buses. At least 30 vehicles were damaged in the incident. The police had to resort to a lathi charge to disperse the crowd. Two of the OB vans belonged to ABP News and P7 news. Eight of the 45 policemen hurt sustained serious head injuries. The police claimed that \\"at least five woman police constables were molested by mob.\\" There were also reports that a few of the rioters had stolen police weapons and fired in the air and at the police, but no casualties were reported. Some photographers were also reportedly injured during the violence. The police later claimed that provocative pamphlets were distributed during the protest, and they were investigating their source. The Amar Jawan Jyoti memorial for martyred soldiers in South Mumbai was desecrated during the riot. The President of the Raza Academy, Alhaj Mohammed Saeed Noori Sahab, said the \\"miscreants\\" involved in the violence were not associated with the academy. \\"Our protest was peaceful,\\" he said. Noori stated that an \\"irresponsible\\" speech had been made during the rally, which the Indian Express claimed, exacerbated tensions. Noori said: \\"There were several persons on the stage. One irresponsible person made statements regarding the media coverage. He was immediately stopped and attempts were made to calm the situation. We had no idea that this will happen,\\" he said, condemning the attack on the media. Riots at Azad Maidan led to panic in the nearby colleges and hospitals. Cama and Albless Hospital and St Xavier's College went in lock-down mode to prevent rioters from entering their premises. While condemning the violence caused by rioters, All India Secular Forum social activist Irfan Engineer blamed Raza Academy for being parochial in nature. Engineer said: \\"The riots have ruptured the lives of every person in Assam. It has nothing to do with Muslims, Hindus, Bodos or anybody. Raza Academy, while organising the rally, should have taken all measures to see that the crowd does not go out of control or infiltrators take advantage of it or that protest rally just does not become confined for one community and thereby score an advantage in the community itself.\\" 23 people were arrested on charges of murder and have been remanded to police custody. Raza Academy and Madinatul Ilm Foundation were booked under section 302 of IPC. Police suspect that Facebook and SMS's were used to mobilise the mob. The rioters were found carrying sticks, rods and petrol cans to the rally, so police suspect the riot was pre-meditated. They are investigating the source of the weapons. Police have found CCTV footage showing protesters pouring petrol on vehicles before setting them alight. On 14 August 2012, Bal Thackeray chief of Shiv Sena and editor of Saamna newspaper published an editorial condemning the Congress-ruled Maharashtra government for \\"bowing\\" before \\"anti-national\\" Muslims who went on the rampage in south Mumbai. He compared the violence with the 26/11 terrorist attack on Mumbai. A special team of 12 officers from the Crime Branch headed by an assistant commissioner of police will conduct the investigations. Two police rifles stolen by the mob were recovered in Amrutnagar, Mumbra, in neighbouring Thane district. Only 19 rounds out of 160 rounds stolen have been recovered so far. =Andhra Pradesh= Two labourers, Sudip Barman, 23, and Khanin Ray, 32 from North-East were attacked in Andhra Pradesh while traveling on the Ernakulam Express. One of the men sustained severe injuries and later died. =Uttar Pradesh= On 17 August 2012, Muslim mobs resorted to large scale violence against mediapersons, bystanders, shops, vehicles and tourists in several cities including Lucknow, Kanpur and Allahabad. In Lucknow, after the Friday Namaz, a mob of 500 ravaged various landmarks of the city including Buddha Park, Haathi Park, Shaheed Smarak and Parivartan Chowk, and vandalized many statues including those of Gautam Buddha and Mahavira. =Attacks on people from Northeast and exodus= In August 2012, 30,000 people from the Northeast region had fled Bangalore after attacks and threats of more attacks to come after Ramadan. Shiyeto from Nagaland, resident of Bangalore, was attacked by a group of people who threatened to kill him if he did not leave the city before Ramadan. Another person from Assam was alleged to be attacked. Cities of Pune, Chennai and Hyderabad also witnessed an exodus of people from Northeast. In the national capital Delhi, rumours that people from the Northeast will be targeted, particularly after Ramadan, started circulating. Union Home Ministry has banned bulk SMS and MMS for 15 days to quell rumours and threats. Railways have introduced two special trains to meet the rush of people. Singh called for maintaining peace at \\"any cost\\". Then Bharatiya Janata Party president Nitin Gadkari blamed illegal migrants for the attacks on people from Northeast. Gadkari said the violent mob in Mumbai had waived a Pakistani flag, made provocative remarks and vandalised the martyrs' memorial. He also condemned the attack on the media present and the assault on women police by the demonstrators at Azad Maidan. DGP Dinesh Reddy of Andhra Pradesh State, said, \\"Police have been deployed at all localities with a sizeable North-East population, to boost the community's confidence. Besides, round-the-clock police patrols have been organised.\\" A policeman at Chennai Egmore station, where Howrah-bound trains from the South make a brief halt, remarked about the exodus: \\"The large crowds remind me of the arrival of Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka decades ago.\\" On 18 August 2012, Bangalore police arrested three persons for sending SMSs and MMSs, to incite hatred against people from Northeast. Anees Pasha, Thaseem Nawaz and Shahid Salman Khan were arrested, and four mobiles, two computers and one laptop were seized from them. The culprits are believed to have shown clippings of violence in Assam and told a group of Northeast youths that they would face a similar fate if they continued to stay in Bangalore beyond 20 August. In Coimbatore, police arrested a person identified as B Mohammed Sheik Hassain, for sending more than 200 hate SMSs. According to Hassain, a person named Anvar first sent him the message. Hassain has been charged under the IPC for threat to national integration and creating public mischief, and under the Copyright Act. Investigators traced the source of hate messages to Islamist groups such as Popular Front of India, Harkat-ul- Jihad al-Islami, Manita Neeti Pasarai and Karnataka Forum for Dignity. The SMS campaign was designed to create panic among people from Northeast forcing them to flee and to damage the social fabric and economy. The Kerala State Intelligence was asked to check the veracity of the report with respect to the PFI. =Bangalore= Messages were circulated warning people of Northeastern states of India to leave Bangalore and other cities before Eid al-Fitr (the festival that marks the end of Ramadan) which was on 20 August 2012. Special events were held by the Muslim community at the Jumma Masjid mosque in Bangalore with all the religious leaders present. An assurance was given by Anwar Sharieff, chairman of the Jumma Masjid Trust Board, to people from Northeast that the rumors spread were baseless.

Scientific interests Badoer studied mathematics with Galileo in Padua in 1598/9. He later supported Galileo in 1607, in a priority dispute with Baldassarre Capra over the invention of a military compass. Badoer was one of the correspondents of Paolo Sarpi in Venice, who towards the end of 1608 was making enquiries about the invention in the Netherlands of the telescope. Badoer wrote back in spring 1609 from Paris to Sarpi with news of the commercial telescopes then being sold; it is said that Galileo heard of the new product via this route, around July 1609. He mentioned Badoer as his source in Sidereus Nuncius. Badoer remained close to Galileo, according to Élie Diodati, writing around 1620, when Badoer was already dead. Religion and diplomacy By upbringing Badoer was a Huguenot; he became a Catholic convert through the Jesuit Pierre Coton, at some point in the period 1599 to 1603, and by this connection became a diplomat in the service of Henry IV of France. One mission was to Cleves in 1609, at the time of the Jülich-Cleves War. Sarpi, who in 1609 wrote to Badoer in confiding terms, broke with him around 1610: he then described Badoer as an atheist, and Francesco Castrino of Sarpi's network wrote obscene poems about him (Badoer was a reputed homosexual).David Wootton, Paolo Sarpi: Between Renaissance and Enlightenment, pp. 128–131 and p. 139.

Pollen around 1865 François Paul Louis Pollen (1842–1886) was a Dutch naturalist and merchant. He made major contributions to the study of the Malagasy fauna. Biography Pollen was born on 8 January 1842 in Rotterdam, Netherlands. He had four siblings. His father M.P. Pollen (1806–1857) was owner of the distillery M.P. Pollen & Zoon in Rotterdam. In 1862, he moved to Leiden to study medicine, but Hermann Schlegel encouraged him to study zoology. Together with his companion Douwe Casparus van Dam (1827–1898) he made an expedition to Madagascar which lasted from November 1863 to July 1866. They collected insects, fish, birds, and mammals for the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie in Leiden. Thanks to his wealth Pollen was able to finance this trip by himself. Subsequently, he also financed the field work of other naturalists on Madagascar without being directly involved. Further he collected animal and plant specimens on the Comoros and on the Mascarenes island of Réunion. In 1875 Pollen was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Georg-August University of Göttingen, Germany. Together with Hermann Schlegel he described the Madagascan fruit bat (Eidolon dupreanum) in 1866. In the same year he described the Réunion cuckooshrike (Coracina newtoni ) and again with Schlegel the vanga genus Newtonia in 1868.

She is also the niece of Syrian vice-President Farouk al Shaara. Career and defection Hariri was appointed to Nicosia as Syrian charge d'affaires in November 2010. Her defection was reported by Al Jazeera on 24 July 2012. Two members of the opposition Syrian National Council (SNC) confirmed her defection on 25 July 2012. Al Arabiya reported that she joined the opposition. She reportedly went to Qatar and she is still there. On 25 July 2012, her husband Abdelatif al-Dabbagh, former Syrian ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, also defected to Qatar and joined his wife, Lamia al Hariri. His defection was also confirmed by SNC spokesman Mohammad Sarmini. On 26 July 2012, SANA issued a statement of Syria Foreign Ministry, stating that Lamia al Hariri was not an ambassador, but a diplomat working at the Syrian Embassy in Cyprus and that her mission was to manage the Embassy's affairs until an ambassador or charge d'affaires is appointed. Her defection was significant, since it was the second defection of a Syrian diplomat in July 2012 after that of Nawaf al Fares.
