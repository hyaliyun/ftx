Biography He studied medicine at the University of Berlin (1891-97), and following graduation began his residency at Moabit Hospital-Berlin. From 1910 he worked at the cancer institute of the Berlin-Charit√©. In 1919 he obtained his habilitation with a thesis on pernicious anemia, becoming a professor in 1922. After enforcement of the Nazi edict, Gesetz zur Wiederherstellung des Berufsbeamtentums (1933), Hirschfeld was forced into taking early leave, later losing his teaching licence and his right to practice medicine. In October 1942 he was deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp, where he died on August 26, 1944. Hirschfeld was the author of many publications in the fields of hematology and histology. He is known for his studies of blood diseases and his research on the pathology of the spleen. With hematologist Artur Pappenheim (1870-1916) he conducted studies involving microscopic differentiation of blood cells. He was an editor of several hematological journals, including the \\"Folia Haematologica\\".

The band have released two full-length albums, two EPs, and a split release with Hatespawn. They released their latest full-length album Promulgation of the Fall on May 5, 2014 through their own label, Martyrdoom Productions, and on November 7, 2016, they released their EP 'Sombre Doom'. The band's name is derived from the title of a song written in their previous band Nuclear Winter. History The band was founded by lead guitarist and vocalist Anastasis Valtsanis after the split-up of Nuclear Winter. Nuclear Winter started off as a crust punk band. Later, they began incorporating some influences from the early Swedish death metal scene. Their debut release was a self-financed EP, which already presents a blending of those styles. After a long hiatus, the band released in 2000 a split with Incriminated from Finland. Before the break-up of Nuclear Winter, Valtsanis recorded one last demo with the band. After one of bandmates quit the group, Valtsanis recorded the Abomination Virginborn demo as band's chief songwriter. Valtsanis said in an interview that \\"it was clear that we needed to form a new band, as Nuclear Winter was never my brainchild, and thus I needed to distance myself from anything with which I couldn‚Äôt relate to 100% musically, aesthetically or ideologically. We‚Äôd been friends with T.K. already, we knew he was a competent guitarist, and after all three of us rehearsed together for the first time, it was more than obvious that the line-up was complete. Soon after the first songs were ready, we were so confident in our material that we didn‚Äôt even record a demo, instead we went in the studio and recorded 5 songs that became our debut EP, Purifying Consecrated Ground.\\" The EP was released on May 1, 2005 through Konqueror Records to positive reviews. AllMusic's Cosmo Lee described it as \\"a formidable opening salvo in their war against modernity.\\" Blabbermouth gave the EP 7/10 and praised the songwriting, writing that \\"stands apart from the failures of disingenuous imitators by putting work into the song structures. Varying tempos that run from the plodding and doomy to fast and vicious (with moments that approach raw black metal), there is plenty of meat on the bone here.\\" They released their debut full-length album Graves of the Archangels on January 30, 2008 in collaboration with Nuclear War Now! Productions. The album received overwhelming critical praise and has gained a huge underground following since its release. Blabbermouth praised the album as a step up from their EP, writing that \\"It is one of those albums that is demonstrative of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts.\\" Particular praise was directed towards the songwriting, atmosphere, and the interplay between the guitarists. Sputnik Music's Tyler Munro gave the album 4.5/5, writing that \\"pulls absolutely no punches. As said, it's an absolutely massive sounding album. Lose your focus and the album quite literally turns to background noise. The guitars continually overlap into an ocean of riffs. They splash around and when one guitar isn't doing something the other is. Everything layers unto itself and make no mistakes that the intention hear is to deafen the listener in the most traditional of fashions.\\" He concluded by arguing that \\"Graves of the Archangels is not only one of the best metal releases of the year, but quite possibly one of the best in recent memory.\\" On April 1, they released a split EP with Hatespawn. It was named by Pitchfork's Brandon Stosuy as the 5th best metal album of 2008. He later wrote that \\"It was my favorite death metal album of the year and it's only gotten better since\\". Following a period of inactivity, in April 2014 the band announced the title and artwork of their second-full-length album Promulgation of the Fall. The album was released on May 16, 2014 in collaboration with Profound Lore Records and Norma Envagelium Diaboli. Promulgation of the Fall received overwhelmingly positive critical acclaim from Pitchfork, Sputnik Music, Exclaim!, Metal Injection, and was featured on a number of end-of-year lists. Exclaim! wrote that \\"while Promulgation of the Fall can't take advantage of the element of surprise, burdened with the weight of expectation, the record is no less brilliant, displaying exquisite technical refinement. As glorious as the riffs are, the drumming steals the show here, elemental and mind- altering in its simultaneous precision and ravenousness. The transitions on the album in particular are something to behold, such as the way that the title track opens like a wound and gives way to the massive, crawling \\"Serpentskin,\\" or the way the ecstatic violence of \\"Nigredo\\" shudders, hunches and splits into \\"Schisma.\\" Located firmly in the liminal space between the abject and the sublime, the fascinatingly repulsive and the awfully beautiful, Promulgation of the Fall is a rare death metal accomplishment.\\" On September 30, 2016 the band announced that they would release a new EP titled 'Sombre Doom' on November 7th in collaboration with Norma Envagelium Diaboli, and on October 25 began streaming the EP.  Musical style  Dead Congregation play a style of death metal with significant emphasis on atmosphere rather than speed or technicality, and has been described as \\" uncompromisingly brutal in a subsuming, freeing way.\\" Comparisons have been frequently made to death metal bands such as Incantation, Immolation, and Morbid Angel, and are often described as \\"old-school\\" death metal, in reference to their influence from older death metal styles. The band have stressed the importance of \\"feeling and atmosphere above all.\\" Valtsanis said that \\"The same riff can sound completely different if you alter important factors such us sound, drumming, the way you hit the chords on the guitar and many more. But in the end it‚Äôs all about the atmosphere a recording creates, if it doesn‚Äôt ooze of death and morbidity then it shouldn‚Äôt be labeled as Death Metal simply because the vocals are distorted and the drums are fast.\\" He went on to describe their sound as \\"just darkened Death Metal the way we perceive it as true.\\" Members * Anastasis Valtsanis ‚Äì vocals, lead guitar (2004‚Äìpresent) * Vagelis Voyiantzis ‚Äì drums (2004‚Äìpresent) * T.K. ‚Äì rhythm guitar (2004‚Äìpresent) * George Skullkos ‚Äì bass (2012‚Äìpresent)  Discography  *Purifying Consecrated Ground (EP, 2005) *Graves of the Archangels (2008) *Dead Congregation / Hatespawn (split, 2008) *Promulgation of the Fall (2014) *Sombre Doom (EP, 2016)  References   External links  * Category:Musical groups established in 2004 Category:Greek death metal musical groups Category:Musical groups from Athens Category:Musical quartets ","title":"Dead Congregation"},{"id":"35476668","text":"Ratio of average compensation of CEOs and production workers, 1965‚Äì2009.

Stock options Stock options are the right to buy a specific number of shares of the company's stock during a specified time at a specified price (called the \\"strike price\\"). They became more popular for use in executive pay in the US after a law was passed in 1992 encouraging \\"performance-based\\" pay, and are now used for both short and long-term compensation.

This gives the option owner new options if they use shares of stock to exercise their original options. The reloaded options have the same exercise date but a new exercise price set to whatever the stock price was on the date of the original options were exercised. They are particularly useful when the company stock is volatile because executives can \\"lock in and profit from temporary spike\\" in its price (source: Bebchuk and Fried, Pay Without Performance (2004), p.159 Following the housing bubble collapse, critics have also complained that stock options have \\"turned out to be incredible engines of risk-taking\\" since they offer \\"little downside if you bet wrong, but huge upside if you roll your number.\\" An example being options given in compensation to buy shares of stock in the CEO's company for $100 when the price is currently $80. Given a choice between a high risk plan that has equal chance of driving the company's share price up to $120 or down to $30, or a safe path likely to cause a more modest rise in share price to $100, the CEO has much more incentive to take the risky route since their options are just as worthless with a modest increase (to $100/share or less) than as with a catastrophic fall in price.Why Stock Options Are a Bad Option April 21, 2009 Executive's access to insider information affecting stock prices can be used in the timing of both the granting of options and sale of equities after the options are exercised.

The packages include features such as retirement plans and deferred compensation, as well as post-retirement perks and guaranteed consulting fees. From 2000 to 2011, the top 21 \\"walk-away\\" packages given to CEOs were worth more than $100 million each and came to a total of almost $4 billion.Twenty-One U.S. CEOs with Golden Parachutes of More Than $100 Million , GMI, January 2012 By Paul Hodgson, Senior Research Associate, and Greg Ruel, Research Associate This compensation differs from what lower level employees receive when leaving their employer in that it is either not offered to non-executives (in the case of the perks and consulting fees) or is not offered beyond the level where there are tax benefits (retirement plans, deferred compensation). Prior to a 2006 SEC overhaul of proxy disclosures of executive compensation, the packages were unique to executives because unlike salary, bonuses, and stock options, they had the advantage of not being required to be disclosed to the public in annual filings, indicating the dollar value of compensation of the CEO and the four other most highly paid executives. easily accessible to the prying eyes of investment analysts and the business media. The SEC required only the compensation of current employees be reported to shareholders, not the perks and cash provided to anyone no longer working for the firm.Bebchuk and Fried, Pay Without Performance (2004), (pp.100, 109) In this way, they constitute \\"stealth compensation\\".Bebchuk and Fried, Pay Without Performance (2004), (pp.95‚Äì96, 99)\\"none of .... value from pensions, deferred compensation, post-retirement perks and consulting fees, and loan arrangements ... appears in the pay statistics that financial economists use in their studies.\\" (pp.135‚Äì136) SEC regulations since 2006 have brought more transparency. Pensions and deferred compensation Because the 401(k) plans‚Äîwidely provided to corporate employees‚Äîare limited in the amount that is tax deductible to the employer and employee ($17,000 in annual contributions as of 2012, a small sum to top executives), executives are commonly provided with Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans (aka SERPs) (which are defined benefit pension plans) and Deferred Compensation (aka non-Qualifying Deferred Compensation or NQDF). As of 2002, some 70 percent of firms surveyed provided non-qualifying SERPs to their executives, and 90 percent offer deferred compensation programs.\\"Executive Benefits: A Survey of Current Trends: 2003 Results\\". [8. and 37.] (Clark Consulting reports that close to 93 percent of firms responding to a survey said they had Deferred Compensation plans in 2002) These plans differ from 401(k) plans and old pension plans offered to lower- level employees in that the employing company (almost always) pays the taxes on them, and in the case of deferred compensation, the company often provides executives with returns substantially above the stock and bond markets.Bebchuk and Fried, Pay Without Performance (2004), p.106 This compensation can be considerable. One of the few big firms that did disclose its executive pension liability‚ÄîGE‚Äîreported $1.13 billion for the year 2000.The amount was for all its executives, GE did not specify how much of $1.13 billion was for just the top earning five or the CEO. source: Ellen E. Schultz, \\"Big Sendoff: As Firms Pare Pensions for Most, They Boost Those for Executives,\\" Wall Street Journal, June 20, 2001, A1Bebchuk and Fried, Pay Without Performance (2004), p.101 An example of how much deferred compensation for a CEO at a major firm can amount to is the $1 billion the CEO of Coca-Cola earned in compensation and investment gains over a 17-year period.from August 1980 until his death in October 1997CEO was Roberto Goizueta. \\"Tax Deferred Pay for Executives\\", New York Times, October 18, 1996, A36 In addition, almost all of the tax due on the $1 billion was paid by Coca-Cola company39\\\\.

An example of how pensions have been used as \\"stealthy\\" compensation mentioned above was a change in the formula for determining the pension that one retiring CEO (Terrence Murray of FleetBoston Financial) made shortly before his departure. While his original contract based his pension on his average annual salary and bonus over the five years before retirement, that was changed to his average taxable compensation over the three years he received the most compensation. This change of a few words more than doubled the pension payout from $2.7 million to an estimated $5.8 million, but these numbers did not appear on the SEC- required executive compensation tables or in the annual report footnotes. The numbers were revealed only because a newspaper covering the story hired an actuary to calculate the new basis.

The typical CEO is not anticipating many years of income stream since the usual executive contract is only three years. Furthermore, only 2 percent of firms in the S&P; 500 reduce any part of the severance package once the executive finds another employer. And if employers are worried about coaxing risk-averse potential employees, why are executives the only ones provided with this treatment? \\"Given executives' accumulated wealth and generous retirement benefits they commonly receive after leaving the firm, they are likely to be, if anything, less risk-averse and better able to insure themselves than most other employees.Bebchuk and Fried, Pay Without Performance (2004), p.134 Gratuitous payments Another practice essentially unknown among non-executive employees is the granting of payments or benefits to executives above and beyond what is in their contract when they quit, are fired, or agree to have their companies bought out.Bebchuk and Fried, Pay Without Performance (2004), p.87 These are known as \\"gratuitous\\" payments. They may \\"include forgiveness of loans, accelerated vesting of options and restricted stock, increases in pension benefits (for example by 'crediting' CEOs with additional years of service), awards of lump-sum cash payments, and promises\\" of the previously mentioned consulting contracts. Perks As part of their retirement, top executives have often been given in-kind benefits or \\"perks\\" (perquisites). These have included use of corporate jets (sometimes for family and guests as well), chauffeured cars, personal assistants, financial planning, home-security systems, club memberships, sports tickets, office space, secretarial help, and cell phone service.Bebchuk and Fried, Pay Without Performance (2004), p.107 Unremarked upon when they are used on the job, perks are more controversial in retirement. Perks lack the flexibility of cash for the beneficiary. For example, if the retired executive thinks $10,000 worth of a perk such as private jet travel is the best way to spend $10,000, then $10,000 in cash and $10,000 in perk have the same value; however, if there are any possible circumstance in which they would prefer spending some or all of the money on something else, then cash is better.Bebchuk and Fried, Pay Without Performance (2004), p.108 Also, rather than being a fixed asset whose use costs a corporation less than its worth, perks often cost more than they might first appear. > Consider retiree use of corporate jets, now a common perk.

Most equity compensation, such as stock options, does not impose a direct cost on the corporation dispensing it. It does, however, cost company stockholders by increasing the number of shares outstanding and thus, diluting the value of their shares. To minimize this effect, corporations often buy back shares of stock (which does cost the firm cash income).\\"Most companies that have large employee stock option programs have stock buyback programs so that, as employees exercise their options, the number of shares outstanding remains relatively constant, or undiluted\\" (from The \\"True\\" Cost Of Stock Options, investopedia.com, October 13, 2011 =Life insurance funding= To work around the restrictions and the political outrage concerning executive pay practices, some corporations‚Äîbanks in particular‚Äîhave turned to funding bonuses, deferred pay, and pensions owed to executives by using life insurance policies.

Appearing \\"near the top of published CEO pay rankings\\" became a \\"badge of honor\\" rather than an embarrassment for many CEOs. Economist Paul Krugman argues that the upsurge in executive pay starting in the 1980s was brought on, in part, by stronger incentives for the recipients: *A sharp decline in the top marginal income tax rate‚Äîfrom 70 percent in the early 1970s to 35 percent today‚Äîallows executives to keep much more of their pay and thus incentivizes the top executive \\"to take advantage of his position.\\"Krugman, Paul, The Conscience of a Liberal, 2007, p.145 ... and a retreat of countervailing forces: *News organizations that might once have condemned lavishly paid executives applauded their business genius instead; *politicians who might once have led populist denunciations of corporate pay now need high-income donors (such as executives) for campaign contributions; *unions that might once have walked out to protest giant executive bonuses have been devastated by corporate anti- union campaigns and have lost most of their political influence.

Bogle, Academy of Management, May 2008 According to Kim Clark, Dean of Harvard Business School, the use of consultants has created a \\"Lake Wobegon effect\\" in CEO pay, where CEOs all consider themselves above average in performance and \\"want to be at the 75th percentile of the distribution of compensation.\\" Thus average pay is pushed steadily upward as below-average and average CEOs seek above-average pay.[21.Harvard Business School Dean Kim B.

Conflict of interest Why consultants would care about executives' opinions that they (the executives) should be paid more, is explained in part by their not being hired in the first place if they didn't,John Bogle: \\"First, it must be clear that compensation consultants who consistently recommend lower pay or tougher standards for CEO compensation will likely not be in business for long.\\"(source: Reflections on CEO Compensation By John C.

History =Beginnings= The development of professional corporate management (executives) in the U.S. began after the Civil War, along with the development of stock markets, industry‚Äîand particularly the railroads. Railroads lent themselves to dispersed ownership relying on professional management, because they were far larger, more complex and covered much greater distances than other businesses of the time.The Rise of the Professional Manager in America, The History of Management One of, if not the earliest example of dissatisfaction with high executive pay in U.S. was when the federal government nationalized the railroad industry during World War I, and the very large salaries of the railroad bosses were made public.Frydman, Carola. \\"Learning from the Past: Trends in Executive Compensation over the Twentieth Century\\" . Center for Economic Studies. (2008): 15. Accessed 28 Sept. 2009. After the Securities and Exchange Commission was set up in the 1930s, it was concerned enough about excessive executive compensation that it began requiring yearly reporting of company earnings in hopes of reining in abuse. During World War II, the New York Times denounced President Franklin Roosevelt's unsuccessful attempt to cap Americans' pay at $25,000 (about $331,000 in today's dollars) as a ploy to \\"level down from the top.\\"Brief History: Executive Pay By Laura Fitzpatrick, time.com, 2 November 2009 =Post-World War II= According to Fortune magazine, through the 1950s, 60s, and part of the 70s, CEO pay actually grew more slowly than the pay of average workers. Calculations of the Economic Policy Institute show the ratio of average CEO compensation to average production worker compensation remained fairly stable from the mid-1960s to some time after 1973, at around 24 to 28. But by 1978, that ratio had started to grow reaching 35, and doubling to 70 in 1989.More compensation heading to the very top Economic Policy Institute. 2010 As CEO pay grew it also became more variable. Stock market bubble busts meant drastic cuts in capital gains which were the source of most the equity compensation that made up much or most of CEO pay. The divergence in pay peaked in 2000, with average CEO pay being almost 300 times average worker pay. It peaked again in 2007 during another bull market. Both peaks bottomed out with the collapse of the Dot-com bubble (2002) and housing bubble (2009) respectively. (See graph above.) Time magazine estimates that by 2007 \\"the median S&P; 500 CEO earned in three hours what a minimum-wage worker pulled down in a year\\". =End of the \\"Great Compression\\"= A study of executive compensation from 1936 to 2005 found \\"the median real value of pay was remarkably flat\\" from the end of World War II to the mid-1970s, about the time of the end of the \\"Great Compression\\" of income and wealth distribution in America. Around 1983 Congress passed a law that put a special tax on \\"golden parachutes\\" payouts in excess of three times annual pay. According to business writer Mitchell Schnurman, rather than discouraging the practice, the regulation was seen \\"as an endorsement\\" by \\"corporate America\\" and \\"hundreds of companies adopted\\" the payouts for the first time.Mitchell Schnurman \`CEO Pay Is A Real Problem, but This Isn't the Time to Fix It\` Fort Worth Star Telegram, September 28, 2008, (not available for free on internet) In the 1980s the huge pay packages of two CEOs inspired others to seek big paychecks. Michael Eisner CEO of Disney signed a contract in 1984 that eventually made him the highest-paid CEO up to that point, earning $57 million in 1989. Roberto Goizueta, CEO of Coca-Cola from 1981 until his death in 1997, was the first \\"hired hand\\"‚Äîsomeone who had not founded or financed a business‚Äîto earn more than $1 billion. =Rise of incentive pay= In 1990, theorists on executive pay, Michael Jensen and Kevin M. Murphy, published an article in the Harvard Business Review, in which they argued that the trouble with American business, was that > \`the compensation of top executives is virtually independent of performance. > On average, corporate America pays its most important leaders like > bureaucrats. Is it any wonder then that so many CEOs act like bureaucrats > rather than the value-maximizing entrepreneurs companies need to enhance > their standing in world markets?\` They argued stock options would tie executive pay more closely to performance since the executives' options are valuable only if the stock rises above the \\"strike price\\". Jensen and Murphy believed companies didn't link pay to performance because of social and political pressure including \`Government disclosure rules [that] ensure that executive pay remains a visible and controversial topic.\`Krugman, Paul, The Conscience of a Liberal, 2007, pp.146‚Äì147 With the support of institutional investors and federal regulators three years later a law was passed (Section 162(m) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (1993)) eliminating the tax-deductibility of executive compensation above $1 million unless that compensation was performance- based.IRC Section 162(m) and the Law of Unintended Consequences Kenneth R. Ferris James S. Wallace, November 2006 Thus in the early 1990s, stock options became an increasingly important component of executive compensation.Bebchuk and Fried, Pay Without Performance (2004), p.137Kevin J. Murphy, \\"Executive Compensation\\" in Handbook of Labor Economics, vol.3, bk2, ed. Orley Ashenfelter and David Card (New York: Elsevier, 1999), 2490 =Transparency= Also around that time (1992), the SEC responded to complaints of excessive executive compensation by tightening the rules of disclosure to increase shareholder awareness of its cost. The SEC began requiring the listing of compensation in proxy statements in standardized tables in hopes of making more difficult the disguising of pay that didn't incentivize managers, or was unreasonably high.Bebchuk and Fried, Pay Without Performance (2004), pp.67‚Äì68Paolo Cioppa, 'Executive Compensation: The Fallacy of Disclosure' 2006 Prior to this one SEC official complained, disclosure was \\"legalistic, turgid, and opaque\\": > The typical compensation disclosure ran ten to fourteen pages. Depending on > the company's attitude toward disclosure, you might get reference to a > $3,500,081 pay package spelled out rather than in numbers. ... buried > somewhere in the fourteen pages.

Quinn, \`Executive Compensation Under > the New SEC Disclosure Requirements\` in Seventh Annual Corporate Law > Symposium: Executive Compensation, University of Cincinnati Law Review 63 > (1995): 770‚Äì771] But like the regulation of golden parachutes, this new rule had unintended consequences. According to at least one source, the requirement did nothing to lessen executive pay, in part because the disclosure made it easier for top executives to shop around for higher paying positions. =Post-1992 rise of stock options= By 1992 salaries and bonuses made up only 23 percent of the total compensation of the top 500 executives, while gains from exercising stock options representing 59 percent, according to proxy statements.How High CEO Pay Hurts the 99 Percent William Lazonick. Director, University of Massachusetts Center for Industrial Competitiveness 4 April 2012 Another estimate found that among corporate executives in general, stock options grew from less than a quarter of executive compensation in 1990 to half by 2000. The Section 162(m) law left the so-called \\"performance pay\\" of stock options unregulated. From 1993 to 2003 executive pay increased sharply with the aggregate compensation to the top five executives of each of the S&P; 1500 firms compensation doubling as a percentage of the aggregate earnings of those firms‚Äîfrom 5 per cent in 1993‚Äì95 to about 10 per cent in 2001‚Äì03.Bebchuk & Grinstein \\"The Growth Of Executive Pay\\" In 1994, an attempt to require corporations to estimate the likely costs of the option by the private sector Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) was quashed when corporate managers and executive mobilized, threatening and cajoling the head of the FASB to kill the proposal, even inducing the US Senate to pass a resolution \\"expressing its disapproval.\\"Hacker and Pierson, Winner-Take-All Politics, 2010, p.247 (The cost of options could sometimes be significant. In 1998 the networking equipment seller Cisco Systems reported a $1.35 billion profit. Had it included the market value of the stock options it issued as an expense, that would have been a $4.9 billion loss instead, according to British economist Andrew Smithers.Three, Many? By Paul Krugman nytimes.com, 1 February 2002) Options became worthless if the price of the stock fell far enough. To remedy that problem, firms often \\"repriced\\" options, i.e. lowered the strike price so that the employee option-holder could still make money on it. In 1998 the FASB did succeed in requiring firms to expense repriced options. Following this, repricing became less popular and was replaced in many firms by what some clinics called \\"backdoor repricing\\" i.e. issuing of new options with a lower exercise price.Bebchuk and Fried, Pay Without Performance (2004), p.165Brian J. Hall and Thomas Knox, \\"Managing Option Fragility\\", working paper no.02-19, Harvard Business School, Negotiations, Organizations and Markets Unit, 2002, 3 =Post-2001‚Äì2002 accounting scandals= Executive loans and WorldCom In the 1990s and early 2000s, loans by companies to executives with low interest rates and \\"forgiveness\\" often served as a form of compensation. Before new loans were banned in 2002, more than 30percent of the 1500 largest US firms disclosed cash loans to executives in their regulatory filings,Bebchuk and Fried, Pay Without Performance (2004), p.114 and this \\"insider indebtedness\\" totaled $4.5 billion, with the average loan being about $11 million. \\"About half\\" of the companies granting executive loans charged no interest, and half charged below market rates,Bebchuk and Fried, Pay Without Performance (2004), p.115 and in either case the loans were often \\"forgiven.\\" An estimated $1 billion of the loans extended before 2002 (when they were banned) will eventually be forgiven, either while the executives are still at their companies or when they leave.Bebchuk and Fried, Pay Without Performance (2004), p.116It's Called A 'Loan,' But It's Far Sweeter By David Leonhardt, 3 February 2002 Much of money loaned was used to buy company stock, but executives were not barred from simultaneously selling shares they already owned,A study by Kahle and Shastri found that loans enabling managers to buy 1000 shares of company stock increase managerial ownership by an average of only eight shares. (Kathleen M Kahle and Kuldeep Shastri, \\"Executive Loans\\", Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 39, n.4, December 2004, 791‚Äì811. p.5) and could delay disclosure of their sales of company stock (useful when executive knew the price would fall) for far longer than it could normal sales45 days after the end of the fiscal year for loan payment, versus the tenth day of the following month for normal sales by selling stock to the company to pay off loans. For executives in companies that went bankrupt during the Dot-com bubble collapse, when investors lost billions of dollars, this was very useful. According to the Financial Times, executives at the 25 largest US public firms that went bankrupt between January 2001 and August 2001 sold almost $3 billion worth of their companies' stock during that time and two preceding years as the collective market value of the firms dropped from $210 billion to zero.[28] Andrew Hill, \\"Inside Track\\", Financial Times (London), August 2, 2002, p.10. quoted in Bebchuk and Fried, Pay Without Performance (2004), p.181share prices of several large corporations‚ÄîEnron, Tyco International, Adelphia, Peregrine Systems Kmart and WorldCom -- collapsed in 2002 following accounting scandals And among firms whose shares fell by at least 75 percent, 25 had executives sell a total of \\"$23 billion before their stocks plummeted.\\"\\"You bought, they sold\\", Mark Gimein, Fortune, September 2, 2002 Large loans to executives were involved in more than a couple of these companies, one of the most notable being WorldCom. WorldCom loaned (directly or indirectly) hundreds of millions of dollars‚Äîapproximately 20 percent of the cash on the firm's balance sheet‚Äîto its CEO Bernard Ebbers to help him pay off margin debt in his personal brokerage account. The loans were both unsecured and about half the normal interest rate a brokerage firm would have charged.Bebchuk and Fried, Pay Without Performance (2004), p.113 WorldCom filed for bankruptcy a few months after the last loans were made. Conglomerate Tyco International lent its chief executive, L. Dennis Kozlowski, at least $88 million from 1999 to 2001. During Tyco's 2001 fiscal year, as he continued to say publicly that he rarely if ever sold his Tyco shares, Mr. Kozlowski returned $70 million of the stock to the company, partly to repay loans. Later that year and early the next, Tyco's stock fell 40 percent over \\"concerns that the company's accounting methods ... inflated profits.\\" Enron, etc. Other scandals at the end of the dotcom bubble included: *Enron.

Peregrine, nytimes.com, 24 July 2012 but also involved executive compensation. It banned loans by companies to directors and executives, (although existing loans, worth billions of dollars were not called inPay Without Performance by Lucian Bebchuk and Jesse Fried, Harvard University Press 2004 p.112); included a \\"clawback\\" provision (Section 304) to force the return of executives stock sale profits and bonuses if the money was earned by overstating earnings or otherwise misleading investors. NYSE and NASDAQ stock exchanges also developed new \\"listing requirements\\" for the committees of board of directors that nominate directors for election by shareholders. Committees were now required either to be staffed by independent directors only (NYSE), or by a majority of independent directors (NASDAQ).NASD Rule 4350; NYSE Listed COMpany Manual RUle 303A; SEC Release N. 34-48745 (November 4, 2003) quoted in Bebchuck p.26 Another post-accounting scandal effort was the renewed‚Äîand this time successful‚Äîeffort by reformers to make the cost of stock options paid to executives more transparent by requiring their inclusion in companies income statements. In 2002, large institutional investor TIAA-CREF began lobbying corporations in which it owned shares to begin expensing options. Non-binding shareholder resolutions calling for it became more frequent at corporations' annual shareholder meetings. Hundreds of firms, including Coca-Cola, Bank One, and the Washington Post complied. Despite the investment of much time, effort and political capital by many managers to prevent it, the accounting standards board followed suit.Bebchuk and Fried, Pay Without Performance (2004), pp.149‚Äì50 Ten years after it tried and failed to require publicly owned companies to count stock options as a corporate expense (non-cash), the Financial Accounting Standards Board required publicly owned companies to count stock options as a (noncash) corporate expense. Another, and less controversial, type of executive compensation that was restricted around that time was the split-dollar life insurance policy. Companies purchasing billions of dollars' worth of this insurance where the executive (usually) held the policy and the company paid all or most of the premiums, the executive paying back the company for the premiums without interest when the policy matured. The tax-loophole allowing the payouts to be free of federal income tax was closed in 2003. (However, banks in particular continued to use life insurance policies to fund executive bonuses.) =Disney decision= In 2005, the dismissal of a well-publicized, decade-long lawsuit to overturn a huge severance payout demonstrated the obstacles shareholders faced attempting to control executive pay using the courts. The Delaware Court of Chancery refused to overturn a $140 million severance package ($300,000 for every day as president of the companyOvitz and Eisner: A Kids‚Äô Story By Kurt Andersen, nymag.com, 21 May 2005) paid to Michael Ovitz when he was forced to resign by Disney as its president in 1996. Testimony and documents had described how the Disney compensation committee approved the compensation arrangement after spending only a small fraction of a one-hour meeting on the subject,Bebchuk and Fried, Pay Without Performance (2004), p.48 without receiving any materials in advance, or any recommendations from an experts, and without even seeing a draft of the agreement.Executive compensation and the Disney Decision By Donald A. Glazier, Integro Insurance The court found the decision to pay Ovitz was simply one of the inherent risks shareholders take as owners for which businesses cannot be held liable, since Ovtiz's poor performance did not rise to the level of \`malfeasance\`, or a \\"breach of fiduciary duty and waste of corporate assets\\".Court Refuses to Overrule Disney's Severance Package - I Radin, Stephen A. =Post-retirement transparency= In 2002 news reports appeared that recently retired GE CEO Jack Welch received $2.5 million in in-kind benefits in his first year of retirement, including the unlimited personal use of GE private jet aircraft; exclusive use of a $50,000 a month New York City apartment; unrestricted access to a chauffeured limousine; office space in both New York City and in Connecticut. This came to light not through proxy statements of CEO compensation but from divorce papers filed by his wife. In 2005, columnist and Pulitzer Prize‚Äìwinning journalist Gretchen Morgenson attacked the practice of hiding executive compensation and opined that deferred compensation, supplemental executive plans and executive payouts when a company undergoes a change in control, were \\"three areas that cry out for reform by regulators.\\"Gretchen Morgenson, \\"Executive Pay, Hiding Behind Small Print,\\" New York Times, Feb. 8, 2004 She quoted the president of Equilar compensation analysis firm: > \\"The disclosure of the myriad executive compensation plans - pension, > supplemental executive retirement plans, deferred compensation, split dollar > life insurance‚Äîis not adequate in answering a fundamental question: What is > the projected value of these plans to the executive upon his retirement?\\" Some examples of remuneration that some were surprised to learn a corporation was not required by law to report on executive pay statements include benefits of $1 million/year to an IBM CEO retiring after about nine years of service; a guaranteed rate of return of 12 percent (three times the rate of Treasury bills at the time) on deferred compensation to executives at GE and Enron.;Hacker and Pierson, Winner-Take-All Politics, p.64 executive perquisites of guaranteed hours on corporate jets, chauffeurs, personal assistants, apartments, consulting contracts mentioned above. In August 2006 the SEC \\"voted unanimously to adopt a sweeping overhaul of proxy disclosures for executive compensation.\\" The disclosures gave shareholders \\"a far more complete picture of compensation paid and payable to the CEO, the CFO and the three highest-compensated named executive officers (NEOs)\\".SEC Finalizes Revised Executive Compensation Proxy Disclosure Rules August 2006 Watson Wyatt Insider The changes required disclosure of executive retirement plan and post- employment compensation in tables for Pension Benefits and Deferred Compensation. The pension table would have \\"the actuarial present value\\" of the executive officer's \\"accumulated benefit\\". The Deferred Compensation Table would disclose not just above-market or preferential portion but all contributions, withdrawals, and earnings for the year. It also sharpened \\"focus on disclosure of executive perks\\", according to its press release. According to one critic, the \\"result was to add long (often 30 plus pages) reports\\" on compensation plans to proxy statements but not to \\"change how and how much executives\\" were paid.Edward E Lawler III, \\"Fixing Executive Compensation: Right Time, Wrong Approach\\" Chief Executive, June/July 2009, (excerpt included in the book Are executives paid too much? At Issue. Beth Rosenthal Book editor. Greenhaven Press, c2012.) In August 2006 Congress passed a law limiting the use of life insurance policies to fund executive compensation (an issue dealt with in 2003). Companies were limited to buying policies on the top-earning third of employees, and were required to obtain employee consent. But life-insurance that employers bought prior to this rule change, still covered millions of current and former employees. =Repricing stock options= In the mid-aughts, the backdating of stock options was looked into by federal regulators. Options backdating, changing the date of an options issue, to an earlier time when the share price was lower, has been disparaged as a way of \\"rewarding managers when stock prices fall.\\" An option granted on June 1 when a stock shares price was $100, but backdated to May 15, when shares were only $80, for example, gives the option holder $20/share more profit. In mid-2006, CNN Money reported \\"more than 80 companies\\" had disclosed investigations of one kind or another into \\"options mispricing situations\\".Why options backdating is a big deal By Adam Lashinsky, 26 July 2006 The SEC listed about 60 \\"enforcement actions related to options\\" from 2001 to 2010. One of the largest stock option grants to an executive, and perhaps the largest involved repricing stock options, was $1.6 billion worth of options granted to the CEO of UnitedHealth Group, William W. McGuire. McGuire later returned $618 million as part of settlements reached with the SEC and UnitedHealth shareholders, paid a $7 million fine to the SEC, and was barred from serving as a director of a public company for ten years.Former Chief Will Forfeit $418 Million By Eric Dash, nytimes.com, 7 December 2007 =Crisis of 2008‚Äì2009= In the wake of the housing bubble collapse, \\"a widespread recognition\\" developed that executive pay that \\"rewards executives for short- term results can produce incentives to take excessive risks.\\"How to Tie Equity Compensation to Long-Term Results by Lucian A.

In 2014 all but two per cent of compensation packages got majority shareholder approval, and seventy-four per cent of them received more than ninety per cent approval. The bill also mandates an expansion of the Sarbanes Oxley \\"clawback\\" (recoupment) provision, requiring corporate executive compensation contracts to include a \\"clawback\\" provision, whereby in the event of an accounting restatement, the executives must pay back any bonuses or incentive compensation based on the accounting mistake.

From 2007 to 2008, median total compensation declined by 7.5 percent particularly because of a sharp decline in bonus payouts. On the other hand, equity compensation (option awards and stock awards) rose modestly. During the financial crisis, pressure arose to use more stock options than cash in pay for executives in the financial industry. But as the stock market recovered, options awarded in early 2009 more than doubled in value.

Studies and critics An evidence-based review of experimental and quasi-experimental research, by Philippe Jacquart and J.

Moreover, higher pay fails to promote better performance. Instead, it undermines the intrinsic motivation of executives, inhibits their learning, leads them to ignore other stakeholders, and discourages them from considering the long-term effects of their decisions on stakeholders\\". The economists Xavier Gabaix and Augustin Landier, in a \\"major study\\", provide an example of how \\"it‚Äôs very hard to show that picking one well-qualified C.E.O. over another\\" in large, established companies, \\"has a major impact on corporate performance\\", (and so paying top dollar for the best management talent is not cost-effective). The economists (who believe that current compensation levels are economically efficient), found that if the company with the 250th-most-talented CEO suddenly managed to hire the most talented CEO, that company's value would increase by only 0.016 per cent.Dorff, Michael, Indispensable and Other Myths Founder of the largest mutual fund group in America, John Bogle, laments that \\"the managers of our public corporations\\" have come \\"to place their interests ahead of the interests of their company's owners\\".A Crisis of Ethic Proportions By John C. Bogle, wsj.com April 21, 2009 Bogle believes that executive outlook and compensation is too focused on speculative short term return, with executives tending to treat their stock options as lottery winnings, to be exercise and sold almost immediately (i.e. as soon as they are vested), rather than as investments. Corporations often buy the stock their executives are selling to avoid stock dilution.The Executive Compensation System is Broken By John C. Bogle, December 2005 Executive compensation has been blamed in part for the housing bubble that led to the Great Recession by business journalists*\\"As a start, the best-compensated executives at the top of these big banks, hedge funds and private-equity firms should be treated like general partners of yore. If a firm takes prudent risks that pay off, this top layer of management should be well compensated.

Instead of getting guaranteed salaries or huge bonuses, they should have the bulk of their net worth completely at risk for a long stretch of time‚Äî10 years come to mind‚Äîfor the decisions they make while in charge.

Hacker and Paul Pierson however argue that the use of stock options in American corporations is generally structured more to induce high payouts and less to reward performance than in other countries. In European and other countries, unlike America, options depend on a company outperforming others within the same industry, and there are fewer short term options to capitalize on short term profit boosts from job cuts, restructuring, and/or creative accounting.Hacker, Jacob S., Paul Pierson, Winner-Take-All Politics, (Simon & Schuster, 2010) p.246 As the practice of benchmarking executives against peers gained ground, by 2012 some corporate boards began \\"cherry-picking pay comparisons\\" for CEO pay, for example comparing their executive against execs in much larger companies (used to get CBS CEO Leslie Moonves a $70 million package in 2011), against a different year when pay was higher (used to help PerkinElmer CEO Robert Friel in 2011), against executives in different industries where pay is higher (for example health-care executives rather than agribusiness executives for Hugh Grant of Monsanto), and changing back again when pay in that other industry went down (used to help Frederick Waddell of Northern Trust).

Burdensome government regulation, such as the Sarbanes-Oxley law, prevents publicly traded firms from competing with private firms such as hedge funds where the average compensation for the top 25 managers in 2004 was more than 20 times as much as the average CEO ($251 million). Business leaders have argued that national limits on executive compensation would be self-defeating because the global talent pool for well-qualified executives would lure executives to other areas without such limits. However, according to activist Deborah Hargreaves, there does not seem to be much global employment movement among executives. > Not one of the chief executives heading up the 142 American companies in the > Fortune Global 500 at the end of 2012, for example, was an external hire > from overseas.

Murphy, author and adjunct scholar of the libertarian, hard money Ludwig von Mises Institute, challenges those who belittle large corporate compensation, arguing that it is \\"no more surprising or outrageous\\" in a free market that \\"some types of labor command thousands of times more market value\\" than it is that some goods \\"(such as a house) have a price hundreds of thousands of times higher than the prices of other goods (such as a pack of gum).\\" \\"Scoffers\\" like Warren Buffett, who complain of big executive pay packages (salary, bonuses, perks) even when a company has done poorly, fail to appreciate that this \\"doesn‚Äôt seem outrageous when the numbers are lower.

Though burdensome government regulation of corporate raiders and new entrants in industry distorts the free market in America (Murphy believes), we can be sure that \\"if CEOs and other members of upper management make incredibly high earnings year after year, it must be that the shareholders find their services worth the expense. In some cases it may take the outside analyst some effort to discover how, but we shouldn‚Äôt doubt that the shareholders are careful with their money.\\"Robert P. Murphy ‚Ä¢ Are CEOs Paid Too Much?

Mason, WebMemo N. 2570, 30 July 2009 Edward E Lawler III, writing in Chief Executive journal, notes that a blanket cap on pay might do away with incentive pay and whatever performance benefits it provides, since executives would then be strongly incentivized to insist their pay be the maximum and the incentive pay of bonuses and stock options is by definition variable and uncertain. A study by University of Florida researchers found that highly paid CEOs improve company profitability as opposed to executives making less for similar jobs. A 2011 study by several Brock University professors of business found the market \\"may have overreacted\\" to the initial investigation announcements of backdating of options, and a \\"media bias\\" towards bad rather than good news. Reform =Efforts= The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has asked publicly traded companies to disclose more information explaining how their executives' compensation amounts are determined. The SEC has also posted compensation amounts on its websiteThe Securities and Exchange Commission website to make it easier for investors to compare compensation amounts paid by different companies. It is interesting to juxtapose SEC regulations related to executive compensation with Congressional efforts to address such compensation.Kenneth Rosen, Who Killed Katie Couric? And Other Tales from the World of Executive Compensation Reform, 76 Fordham Law Review, 2907 (2007) One attempt to give executives more \\"skin in the game\\" of increasing stockholder value has been to set up Target Ownership Plans, whereby the executives are given a \\"target\\" of a number of shares of company stock to own. These plans have not impressed critics, in part because of the low targets set‚Äîoften less than the value of one year of the executive's compensation‚Äîand in part because firms seldom impose a penalty for not meeting the target.John E Core and David F. Larcker, \\"Performance Consequences of Mandatory Increases in Executive Stock Ownership\\", Journal of Financial Economics 64 (2002): 322, behind paywall, quoted in Bebchuck and Fried Pay without Performance, 2004, p.177 According to David F. Larcker, some studies have found higher likelihood of restatement of earnings, (i.e. discovery of accounting manipulation) in companies where executives hold large equity positions, some have found a lower likelihood, and some have found no association.Executive Equity Ownership By David F. Larcker, 2011, http://www.gsb.stanford.edu (no direct link) Shareholders, often members of the Council of Institutional Investors or the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility have often filed shareholder resolutions. 21 such resolutions were filed in 2003. About a dozen were voted on in 2007, with two coming very close to passing. As of 2007 the U.S. Congress was debating mandating shareholder approval of executive pay packages at publicly traded US companies. Unions have been very vocal in their opposition to high executive compensation. The AFL-CIO sponsors a website called Executive Paywatch which allows users to compare their salaries to the CEOs of the companies where they work.

Changes in compensation *Encourage long term thinking and discourage pursuit of short-term profits. **Extend the vesting period of executives' stock and options.How to Fix Executive Compensation by Alex Edmans, 27 February 2012 Current vesting periods can be as short as three years, which encourages managers to inflate short-term stock price at the expense of long-run value, since they can sell their holdings before a decline occurs.When Bosses Take The Short-Term View by The Economist, 8 February 2014 **Take away compensation (\\"malus\\" or \\"clawback\\") for poor performance as well as rewarding executives (\\"bonus\\") for good performance (known as the Bonus-malus system). Bonuses would be held in escrow and not immediately vested and in the event of losses in future years reduced retroactively (aka clawed back). Research on similar clawback provisions that were voluntarily adopted by US firms between 2007 and 2009 finds that clawback provisions improve the accuracy of firms' financial statements and increase external users reliance on firms' accounting information. However, the same research also notes that executives demand an increase in base salary to offset the additional risk of having to repay incentive compensation in the event of a restatement.'Does Voluntary Adoption of a Clawback Provision Improve Financial Reporting Quality?' by deHaan, Ed; Hodge, Frank; and Shevlin, Terry J. (2012) Contemporary Accounting Research, forthcoming. **Prevent insider trading by executives (which currently is extremely difficult to monitor or prosecute) by taking away control over the exact time of unloading options and other equity compensation.Bebchuck, p.179 *Prevent executives from hedging their stock or stock options in the company, since hedging can weaken or eliminate the incentive effects that these instruments are intended to have on the manager.Bebchuck, pp.177‚Äì178 *Factor out windfalls unrelated to the managers' own efforts in calculating bonuses or granting stock options. One way is Indexing Operating Performance to exclude market and sector-wide share price movements. With stock options the exercise price would follow the index. Instead of issuing options to the executive with an exercise price equal to the current market price of (for example) $100, the options strike price would be $100 multiplied by the market index.Bebchuk and Fried, Pay Without Performance (2004) p.141 Performance conditioned vesting would not adjust the strike price but simply not vest the options unless certain performance targets were met. The adjustments could be designed to be gentle, moderate or aggressive depending on the firm's situation. A more gentle benchmark to be exceeded for example might be the appreciation of the shares of the bottom 20 percent of firm in the company's sector.Bebchuk and Fried, Pay Without Performance (2004) p.140 Another windfall to be adjusted for would be falling interest rates. *Including Debt or Debt-Like compensation along with cash and equity based compensation. Equity based compensation encourages risk taking by executives. Making part of an executive compensation in the form of a debt-like instrument should reduce this tendency since debt value does not benefit from successful gambling of company income and more closely align managers with all investors, both shareholders and bondholders.Why It Pays to Link Executive Compensation with Corporate Debt 7 July 2010 Knowledge@WhartonAlex Edmans and Qi Liu (2011): Inside Debt Review of Finance Therefore, as of 2011, there are several proposals to enforce financial institutions to use debt like compensation.Bolton, P., Mehran, H. and Shapiro, J.

Characters are listed only once, normally under the first applicable subsection in the list; very minor characters are listed with a more regular character with whom they are associated. Characters that appear in only one episode are not listed. This also includes information and characters from the feature film Top Cat: The Movie and the prequel film Top Cat Begins. Core TV show characters =Top Cat= Top Cat (or simply T.C.) is the yellow-furred, charismatic, and clever main character of the series. He wears a mauve pork pie hat and a matching waistcoat. He often rips off and/or tricks minor characters, Officer Dibble, and even his own gang. He does respect the effort the gang does for him, but he often takes credit for it and he's very wise. That said, he is loyal to the gang and will help one of them if they need it. He also stops Officer Dibble from arresting him by lying to Dibble about how much talent Dibble has. He is voiced by Arnold Stang in the style of Phil Silvers in the TV show, and by Daws Butler in Yogi's Ark Lark. In most of his modern appearances, he is voiced by Tom Kenny. He also appeared in various Wonderland Sydney commercials in Australia where he was voiced by Keith Scott. In the film, Top Cat: The Movie, he is again the main protagonist. His voice, by Jason Harris, is narrower and a bit lower-pitched. This version of the character has a romantic interest in Trixie. He also tells his gang that they only steal from people who deserve it. He is framed by Lou Strickland, who uses a robot look-alike to get him arrested, whereupon he is placed in a dog jail. =Benny the Ball= Benny, a blue-colored cat with a white sports jacket that fastens with a single button at his neck, is T.C.'s right-hand man; they share a close friendship. He is short, innocent, chubby, and na√Øve. His eyes are shown as black dots unlike the other cats who have white sclerae with black pupils. Benny may appear to be simple-minded, due to the fact that he always gives the game away, but he manages to ask the most logical questions during the gang's erratic endeavors. A number of episodes have focused on Benny, including \\"The Violin Player\\", \\"The Unscratchables\\" and \\"The Missing Heir\\". He also made a cameo appearance on Kid vs. Kat in \\"The Kat Whisperer\\". Benny the Ball is modeled after his voice actor Maurice Gosfield in the TV series. He was voiced by John Stephenson in Yogi's Ark Lark, Avery Schreiber in Top Cat and the Beverly Hills Cats, and Maurice LaMarche in Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law. In the movie, he sometimes gets Top Cat and his gang in trouble, and his fandom of fictional musician Lazlo-Lazlo serves to introduce that character. In the film, his arms are slightly shorter and smaller, his voice, by Chris Edgerly, is a little bit clearer, and he is slightly more clumsy. =Choo-Choo= Choo-Choo (nicknamed Chooch by T.C. and the gang) is enthusiastic and devoted to T.C., even though often clueless as to what he is doing. He is a pink cat with a white turtleneck and is often depicted with the eyes of a Siamese cat. He lives at the fire house, as seen in the episode \\"Hawaii Here We Come\\". Choo-Choo is apparently a very skilled poker player, as stated by Top Cat in the episode \\"The Golden Fleecing\\". He had a couple of love crushes, as seen in \\"Choo-Choo's Romance\\" and \\"Choo-Choo Goes Gaga-Gaga\\", however, unlike Fancy-Fancy or Top Cat, Choo-Choo has very little courage when talking to females. His voice, by Marvin Kaplan in the TV series, is reminiscent of Woody Allen's. Lenny Leonard on The Simpsons is thought by some to sound like Choo-Choo. Choo-Choo also appeared in several Wonderland Sydney commercials in Australia along with Top Cat and was also voiced by Keith Scott. In the film, his voice, by Jason Harris, is a bit narrower and higher. This version of the character spends a lot of time at a bingo hall. =Brain= Brain, an orange cat with a purple T-shirt with a black line, appears as a common assistant to Top Cat. Contrary to his name (which appears to have been given in jest or sarcasm), Brain is the dimmest- witted member of the alley gang, and is notorious for being unable to keep a secret. He is also portrayed as stuttering. He also seems to be in charge of the group's money (which they rarely have), and he runs up and down the road. Despite his apparent stupidity, he can sometimes say something brilliant, which T.C. instantly rephrases to make it sound like T.C. thought of it himself. He is voiced by Leo De Lyon in the TV series. In the movie, his voice, by Jason Harris, is a little deeper, and he is made even more obviously stupid. =Fancy-Fancy= Fancy-Fancy also appears to be a common helper to Top Cat. He is laid-back, sweet-talking, handsome, and kind-hearted, and is regularly seen chatting up the ladies before leaving them when hearing the trashcan lid call that signals the gang to convene. A brown cat with a white scarf, his look and voice is based on Cary Grant. He is voiced by John Stephenson in the TV series. In the film, which features robots as a plot device, he is able to disguise himself as a feminine robot. His voice is a bit narrower and more \\"fancy\\" than in the TV series. He also has a girlfriend, with whom he has an uneasy relationship. Matthew Piazzi voices him in the movie. =Spook= Spook, with olive green fur and a torn black tie, is one of the most streetwise members of the gang. He is a sweet-talking cat whose vernacular is based on that of a beatnik, inasmuch as he breaks up his sentences by interjecting the word \\"like\\" frequently. He is similar to Fancy- Fancy in demeanor and appearance and appears more fun-loving than kind- hearted. When the gang need some help with a situation, he usually steps up to the plate. Like Choo-Choo, he is a skilled poker player as stated by Top Cat in the episode \\"The Golden Fleecing\\". He is voiced by Leo De Lyon in the TV series. In the movie, he sounds younger, his over-use of \\"like\\" is altered a bit, and he is a pool hustler. He has his longest speaking role in the movie, when he tells the gang about his friend who may be able to help them break Top Cat out of jail. Benjamin Diskin voices him in the movie. =Officer Charlie Dibble= Charlie Dibble is a New York Police Department officer whose beat includes Top Cat's gang's alley. His full name is discovered in the episode \\"T.C. Minds the Baby\\" where T.C. and the gang found an abandoned baby and named him Charlie after Officer Dibble. Though he usually resents the gang's presence in the alley, there are times when he respects and loves them. The gang, despite the many times they managed to trick Dibble, respect and care for him as well. During the episode \\"Dibble's Birthday,\\" where T.C. wanted to sell all of Dibble's presents meant for his birthday, the rest of the gang refused to cooperate. They wanted to cheer Dibble up with a birthday party as he was feeling depressed, one of the rare moments in the series the others weren't willing to follow Top Cat's orders. In the end, T.C. has a change of heart and works together with the gang to cheer Dibble up and to give him his presents. A recurring theme in the series is about Officer Dibble wanting T.C. to clean up the alley and to stay off his telephone. Unfortunately for Dibble, his attempts to convince T.C. usually don't yield the results he was looking for, but it never stops him from trying. Dibble's superior is Sergeant Murphy. Dibble is sometimes mocked with variations of his name by T.C., such of Dabble, Drubble, Dribble, and so on. In reference to this character, \\"Dibble\\" has been adopted as an English-language derogatory Manchester slang term for police officers. He is voiced by Allen Jenkins in the TV series, John Stephenson in Yogi's Treasure Hunt and Top Cat and the Beverly Hills Cats, and Frank Welker in a 2016 Halifax commercial. In the film, where he is voiced by Bill Lobley, his lifelong dream is to become the chief of police, and it is revealed that he works overtime at his police work to impress the current chief, who is due to retire. The movie gives various personal details about him, including that his birth date is December 18 (coinciding with that of Lou Strickland), his favorite food is tuna sandwiches, he enjoys fly-fishing, and he keeps a \\"lucky penny\\" (which is actually a nickel) in his shoe. Minor TV characters featuring in the movie =Griswald= Griswald is a bulldog who is sporadically seen in the show, often antagonizing Top Cat and his gang. He was orange but he is mainly white. He is vicious, but also gullible and dim- witted. He was once employed by the police to help Dibble with his beat. He is voiced by Don Messick in the TV series, In the film, he starts out as an enemy of Top Cat, but is convinced by T.C. that he is, in fact, a cat, which Griswald believes due to his gullible nature. At the end, he is invited to stay with T.C. and become one of the gang. Griswald is voiced by Jason Harris in the UK version of the movie, and by Danny Trejo in the US release. =Lazlo-Lazlo= Lazlo-Lazlo (known as Lazlo-Lozla in the Spanish version) is a janitor-turned-musician. When Officer Dibble bought a record by him, the musical director of Carnegie Hall mistakenly thought it was Benny playing and took in Benny for his talent, before realizing that it wasn't Benny, but the janitor. Before being \\"discovered\\" in this manner, Lazlo was told to \\"stick to your broom\\" by Top Cat, after asking for advice. Despite being famous now, Lazlo still works by day as the venue's janitor, and cleans up after every show. In the film, Top Cat and Benny see him again, when the Maharajah comes to watch him perform. =The Maharajah= The Maharajah of Pookajee is a Middle Eastern gentleman, known for giving away rubies as tips, and (in the 2011 movie) is a huge fan of Lazlo-Lazlo. In the movie, where he is named Pikachu instead of Pookajee, he helps Lou Strickland build his police robots. He also claims that Lazlo-Lazlo never misses a note and will bet all of his rubies on it. Top Cat instead bets him for his device, the Maharajahton 5000, which can transform into anything (MP3 player, pencil sharpener, suitcase, hair-dryer, etc.), having a plan to ensure Lazlo misses a note. =Police Chief Eugene Prowler= The chief of police at the thirteenth precinct, and Dibble's boss. =Mrs. Ball= Benny the Ball's mom appears in some episodes of the TV series and Top Cat Begins. A homely old lady, she remains unaware throughout the movie about T.C.'s criminal activities. She makes some really terrible food but is very caring toward the cats. =A.T. Jazz= A newcomer to the street who immediately attempts to take control of the street, thinking himself to be the \\"Top Cat\\" and calling himself A.T. Jazz an abbreviation for All That Jazz. =Patrick (Pedro) Dibble= The owner of Pedro's Pizza Pallazo and Dibble's cousin. Pedro owns a pizza parlor near Top Cat's alley and has befriended Top Cat's Gang by giving them free pizza (as explained in the episode \\"Raffeefleas\\"). =Big Gus= A notorious gangster whom Top Cat runs into twice in The Original Series. He is best known for his attempt to steal \\"The Hopeless Diamond\\", a jewel worth $500,000, only to be thwarted by Benny the Ball, who accidentally swallows the jewel. In the 2011 movie, He helps the gang break Top Cat out of Dog Jail. Beverly Hills Cats characters =Kitty Glitter= A cat of Beverly Hills, who is a golddigger wanting to marry a rich cat, and is only seen in \\"Top Cat and the Beverly Hills Cats\\". Voiced by Teresa Ganzel. =Amy Vandergelt= =Snerdly= =Rasputin= Movie characters These are the main original characters which appear only in the film, Top Cat: The Movie. =Trixie= Trixie is a grey-blue female feline who works for Lou Strickland and his police robots and is Top Cat's crush. After she found out that T.C. is innocent, she decides to help Dibble and free Top Cat. She is voiced by Melissa Disney. =Lou Strickland= Lou Strickland is a greedy man and is the main antagonist in the film. Despite his ugly look, he claims to be the most handsome person of all time. In a parody of Robocop, the movie has him creating android robots to replace policy officers, because he thinks humans make mistakes that technology can prevent. After gaining control of the police department, he decides not to fire Dibble because they share the same birthday, and he needs someone to help activate the robots. He shows up as a VIP at the Lazlo-Lazlo concert, but gets his tickets stolen by Top Cat. He was voiced by Jason Harris in the British and Mexican releases of the film, and Rob Schneider in the US version. Begins characters =Mr. Big= A feared crime boss alligator, Mr. Big has his hands in every criminal activity and takes a 99% fee from every criminal operating on his turf. Dibble has been trying for a long time to apprehend him, and when Top Cat and Benny steal Mr. Big's diamonds, they end up as important witnesses in the case - prompting Mr. Big to offer $50.000 reward for Top Cat (and 95 cents for Benny) -resulting in a huge manhunt. In the end, Top Cat uses a similar strategy by luring the people on the manhunt into Mr. Big's lair and offering $50.001 for HIS capture. He is voiced by Darin De Paul. =Granny Dibble= Dibble's rather militaristic grandma, who is a sweet lady on the surface, but hoards weapons and ammo and knows how to handle them. Dibble smuggles Top Cat and Benny to her out of town when Mr. Big's goons are looking for them, and she ends up distracting the goons with grenades, hand-to-hand combat and even a tank she has hidden under her shed! She is voiced by Charlie Adler =Chief Thumbton= Chief Thumbton is the Chief of Police, and Officer Dibble's boss. =Bad Dog= Mr. Big's top henchman, a not very bright brown pitbull with anger issues. He leads the manhunt against Top Cat but is easily fooled when Dibble disguises him as a baby. He ends up defeated when T.C. simply hits him with a newspaper saying \\"BAD DOG!\\" =Panther= Mr. Big's henchwoman, a grey-furred kitty in a low-cut dress who speaks in French accent. She speaks little and is generally seen polishing her nails, but is an effective combatant. She ends up seduced by Fancy-Fancy when he starts speaking French to her (even though it is gibberish), though she breaks up with him during the credits. =Rat= A short, rat-like human henchman of Mr. Big. He generally ends up blown up or flattened in every encounter. =Furletta Duchat= A blue kitty singer working in Mr. Big's bar, she ends up in possession of the necklace made out of the stolen diamonds. Benny sneaks into her dressing room and steals the jewels back, but ends up accidentally knocking her out with the door - and then having to impersonate her to sing in her stead.

The election used the twenty wards created under the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, with 67 Councillors being elected. Each ward elected either 3 or 4 members, using the STV electoral system. The election saw Labour retain their traditional position as the largest party on the Council as they gained 3 seat from 2007 to be just 1 seat short of an overall majority. The Scottish National Party also increased their representation and remained in second place on the authority with 4 net gains. The Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party were the biggest losers, falling from 8 seats to just 3. Independents lost a seat to return to the Council with 2 seats. The Scottish Liberal Democrats lost 1 seat to be reduced to a solitary member. Following the election the Labour Party again formed an administration. In February 2013, Labour gained overall control of South Lanarkshire Council after winning aRutherglen South by- election from the SNP.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland- politics-21473487 Election result Note: \\"Votes\\" are the sum of first preference votes across all council wards.

Biography Tudor was born in Monmouth on 3 July 1785 and he has christened at St Marys Church. His family had come to Monmouth after they had lost the family fortune. Tudor's grandfather, James Tudor Morgan, has been High Sheriff of Monmouthshire in 1744. His father, Owen Tudor, worked as a bookseller earning money to bring up his children which included two boys with artistic talents. Thomas and John Tudor's help together with their father's assistance in creating sketches and diagrams for his book Historical Tour in Monmouthshire was acknowledged by Archdeacon William Coxe. This was despite Tudor being only thirteen and his brother was just fifteen. Evening LandscapeThomas Tudor, The Tate, accessed April 2012 From 1809 to 1819, both brothers exhibited at the Royal Academy and John continued for an additional three years. Thomas's seventeen successfully accepted paintings were mostly typographical but six were portraits. Thomas was known for the amazing detail of his sketches of buildings. Although he did paint in oils it is his, frequently monochrome, water colours that are more common. These water colours were very detailed but frequently incomplete. Around 1825 Tudor began to spend more time on being a land agent for Colonel Henry Morgan-Clifford. On his behalf he would collect rents in Carmarthenshire, Monmouthshire and near Ross- on-Wye. Tudor built \\"Tudor House\\" in the part of Monmouth which is called Wyesham. Tudor also owned property at Penallt. Tudor died in 1855 and he was buried in Dixton. Legacy Tudor has painting in the Tate, the National Library of Wales, the Victoria and Albert Museum, Newport Museum and Monmouth Museum.

It is the only species in the genus Avitelmessus and is known from finds in the southeastern United States. Taxonomical history Avitelmessus was described in 1923 by Mary J. Rathbun, who assigned it to the family Atelecyclidae. Martin Glaessner reassigned it to the family Dakoticancridae in 1960. Description The shell of Avitelmessus was about in length and was nearly ovular in shape, with a \\"rounded outline\\". The upper surface was marked by \\"broad, shallow grooves\\" which formed two attached diamond-like shapes, with the larger one closer to the front. \\"Subsidiary\\" grooves came in contact with both sides of the larger diamond. The \\"fairly blunt\\" anterior edge of the carapace possessed a small, central rostrum, with orbits on either side. The front legs were modified to become chelipeds, with pincers formed by an upper finger, which was movable, and a lower finger, which was stationary (an extension of the previous leg segment). All limbs were covered by \\"fine granules\\". At least one specimen with \\"color markings\\" (considered rare among fossil crabs) has been discovered. The colors are described as \\"a medium background, dark spots and blotches, and light lines\\". Fossil sites Avitelmessus was originally described by Rathbun based on the holotype from the Peedee Formation of North Carolina, as well as specimens from the Ripley Formation of Mississippi. Later, she would also describe specimens from western Tennessee. Avitelmessus is also present on the Atlantic coastal plain and in the Mississippi Embayment. The \\"near restriction\\" of Avitelmessus to the Mississippi embayment (and that of other Dakoticancridae members to other specific areas) suggest \\"provincialism\\" among the family.

Located in Brussels' city section of Haren and adjacent municipality of Evere, it was established by the German Empire in 1914 and lasted until the early 1950s when it was closed. Meanwhile it had been replaced by nearby Melsbroek airfield that Nazi Germans had established in World War II, which developed into the current Brussels Airport. The former grounds of Haren-Evere airfield were redeveloped as part of the expanding Brussels urban area; some buildings remain in use as facilities of the Belgian military. The headquarters of NATO are located at Haren (Brussels) on part of the former airport grounds. History The advancing Imperial German Air Service established it as military airfield Flugplatz Br√ºssel in 1914 during World War I. In February 1915 they completed an additional Zeppelin Hangar. This was partially destroyed on 7 June 1915 during an attack on airship LZ38. Although the hangar was repaired, airships were no longer parked at the airfield. At the end of the war the airfield was abandoned by the Germans when they withdrew from Belgium in the aftermath of the November 1918 Armistice. The airfield being in the Belgian capital, it became the home of the Belgian Air Force during the 1920s. The Zeppelin Hangar was not torn down until 1923, as it was used to park aircraft left behind by the Germans. Some of the aircraft were used for the first civilian flights at the airfield. Increasingly, it became the hub of Belgian civil aviation. In 1923 a radio centre was built, along with a new terminal. In February 1925 Sabena inaugurated the first Congo flight, when a Handley Page W8f departed the airfield for Leopoldstad. A notable visitor was Charles Lindbergh, who flew into Haren only a week after his historic New-York-Paris flight in 1927. Air traffic continued its steady growth, and by 1929 a new terminal (the third) was inaugurated. Several international airlines used Haren in the 1930s, such as Imperial, KLM, Air France, Deutsche Luft Hansa and British Continental Airways. With the Invasion of Belgium in May 1940 by the Germans, the Luftwaffe expanded the airfield, by building a new hangar (VIII) and an 820m long concrete runway (09-27). In addition, the Germans began building a new airfield at nearby Melsbroek (near Zaventem) and in November 1942 had connected the two airfields with a taxiway. On 3 September 1944 Haren-Evere area was liberated, and only three days later the first RAF squadrons landed. It was designated as Advanced Landing Ground B-56 Evere.Johnson, David C. (1988), U.S. Army Air Forces Continental Airfields (ETO), D-Day to V-E Day; Research Division, USAF Historical Research Center, Maxwell AFB, Alabama. As the Germans had left in a hurry, the twin airfields needed very little repair work. Between September 1944 and October 1945, the British further expanded the runways, taxiways and aprons. When World War II ended the two airfields continued to be used by the military. It took until March 1946 before the airfields were fully released for civilian use. Due to the encroaching urban area of Brussels, the Haren-Evere airfield began shutting down in the late 1940s and airport development focused on its twin airfield nearby, Melsbroek (which would eventually develop into the current Brussels Airport), although repair services of Sabena and the Belgian Air Force would remain in Haren- Evere until the early 1950s, which is when all aircraft handling activities were ceased. Aftermath In the 1950s, all the runways were broken up and the airport terrain was subsequently divided and used for new roads, office blocks, military terrain and smaller residential sections. In 1961 Belgium began using the former air terminal at Haren as its Tactical Air Forces headquarters, also called King Albert barracks. To the south of that, across the expressway Leopold III Boulevard, another military domain, called Queen Elisabeth Quarter, was set up, hosting the headquarters of the Belgian Army command. In 1967, NATO moved its headquarters at Brussels (Haren) to a section of this southern portion of the former airfield terrain, after a hasty departure from Paris caused by the withdrawal of France from under NATO's military command structure. In 2002 the Belgian Government offered much of King Albert barracks to NATO, for relocation and building of a new headquarters complex always on Haren (Brussels), which is slated to complete in 2016.

It was developed by Vladimir Belinski and Vladimir Zakharov in 1978.V. Belinskii and V. Zakharov, Integration of the Einstein Equations by Means of the Inverse Scattering Problem Technique and Construction of Exact Soliton Solutions, Sov. Phys. JETP 48(6) (1978) The Belinski‚ÄìZakharov transform is a generalization of the inverse scattering transform. The solutions produced by this transform are called gravitational solitons (gravisolitons). Despite the term 'soliton' being used to describe gravitational solitons, their behavior is very different from other (classical) solitons.V. Belinski and E. Verdaguer, Gravitational Solitons, Cambridge Monographs on Mathematical Physics (2001) In particular, gravitational solitons do not preserve their amplitude and shape in time, and up to June 2012 their general interpretation remains unknown. What is known however, is that most black holes (and particularly the Schwarzschild metric and the Kerr metric) are special cases of gravitational solitons.  Introduction  The Belinski‚ÄìZakharov transform works for spacetime intervals of the form :: ds^2 = f (-d(x^0)^2 + d(x^1)^2) + g_{ab} \\\\, dx^a \\\\, dx^b where we use Einstein's summation convention for a,b=2,3. It is assumed that both the function f and the matrix g=g_{ab} depend on the coordinates x^0 and x^1 only. Despite being a specific form of the spacetime interval that depends only on two variables, it includes a great number of interesting solutions a special cases, such as the Schwarzschild metric, the Kerr metric, Einstein‚ÄìRosen metric, and many others. In this case, Einstein's vacuum equation R_{\\\\mu u}=0 decomposes into two sets of equations for the matrix g=g_{ab} and the function f. Using light-cone coordinates \\\\zeta = x^0 + x^1,\\\\eta = x^0 - x^1, the first equation for the matrix g is :: (\\\\alpha g_{,\\\\zeta} g^{-1})_{,\\\\eta} + (\\\\alpha g_{,\\\\eta} g^{-1})_{,\\\\zeta} = 0 where \\\\alpha is the square root of the determinant of g, namely :: \\\\det g=\\\\alpha^2 The second set of equations is :: (\\\\ln f)_{,\\\\zeta} = \\\\frac{(\\\\ln \\\\alpha)_{,\\\\zeta\\\\zeta}}{(\\\\ln \\\\alpha)_{,\\\\zeta}} + \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{4 \\\\alpha_{,\\\\zeta}} \\\\operatorname{tr} (g_{,\\\\zeta} g^{-1} g_{,\\\\zeta} g^{-1}) :: (\\\\ln f)_{,\\\\eta} = \\\\frac{(\\\\ln \\\\alpha)_{,\\\\eta\\\\eta}}{(\\\\ln \\\\alpha)_{,\\\\eta}} + \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{4 \\\\alpha_{,\\\\eta}} \\\\operatorname{tr} (g_{,\\\\eta} g^{-1} g_{,\\\\eta} g^{-1}) Taking the trace of the matrix equation for g reveals that in fact \\\\alpha satisfies the wave equation ::\\\\alpha_{,\\\\zeta\\\\eta}=0  The Lax Pair  Consider the linear operators D_1, D_2 defined by :: D_1 = \\\\partial_\\\\zeta + \\\\frac{2\\\\alpha_{,\\\\zeta}\\\\lambda}{\\\\lambda-\\\\alpha} \\\\partial_\\\\lambda :: D_2 = \\\\partial_\\\\eta - \\\\frac{2\\\\alpha_{,\\\\eta}\\\\lambda}{\\\\lambda+\\\\alpha} \\\\partial_\\\\lambda where \\\\lambda is an auxiliary complex spectral parameter. A simple computation shows that since \\\\alpha satisfies the wave equation, \\\\left[D_1,D_2\\\\right]=0. This pair of operators commute, this is the Lax pair. The gist behind the inverse scattering transform is rewriting the nonlinear Einstein equation as an overdetermined linear system of equation for a new matrix function \\\\psi=\\\\psi(\\\\zeta,\\\\eta,\\\\lambda). Consider the Belinski‚ÄìZakharov equations: :: D_1 \\\\psi = \\\\frac{A}{\\\\lambda-\\\\alpha} \\\\psi :: D_2 \\\\psi = \\\\frac{B}{\\\\lambda+\\\\alpha} \\\\psi By operating on the left-hand side of the first equation with D_2 and on the left-hand side of the second equation with D_1 and subtracting the results, the left-hand side vanishes as a result of the commutativity of D_1 and D_2. As for the right-hand side, a short computation shows that indeed it vanishes as well precisely when g satisfies the nonlinear matrix Einstein equation. This means that the overdetermined linear Belinski‚ÄìZakharov equations are solvable simultaneously exactly when g solves the nonlinear matrix equation . Actually, one can easily restore g from the matrix-valued function \\\\psi by a simple limiting process. Taking the limit \\\\lambda\\\\rightarrow 0 in the Belinski-Zakharov equations and multiplying by \\\\psi^{-1} from the right gives ::\\\\psi_{,\\\\zeta} \\\\psi^{-1} = g_{,\\\\zeta} g^{-1} ::\\\\psi_{,\\\\eta} \\\\psi^{-1} = g_{,\\\\eta} g^{-1} Thus a solution of the nonlinear g equation is obtained from a solution of the linear Belinski‚ÄìZakharov equation by a simple evaluation ::g(\\\\zeta,\\\\eta)=\\\\psi(\\\\zeta,\\\\eta,0) References PDF Category:Exact solutions in general relativity ","title":"Belinski‚ÄìZakharov transform"},{"id":"35477087","text":"Broke Aerodrome was an aerodrome constructed in 1942 by the Royal Australian Air Force as a satellite aerodrome north of Broke, New South Wales, Australia during World War II.

Born to a low-ranking priyayi (noble) family in Blora, Dutch East Indies, Kartodikromo's first employment was with the national railway. Disgusted by the racism shown there, in 1911 he moved to Bandung and found work as a journalist for Medan Prijaji. The following year he moved to Surakarta and worked with two publications, Saro Tomo and Doenia Bergerak; he soon began to write pieces critical against the Dutch colonial government, which led to his arrest. After a period as a correspondent in the Netherlands, Kartodikromo continued his journalism and critique of the government; he also wrote several pieces of fiction. Involved with the Communist Party of Indonesia, after a 1926 communist-led revolt Kartodikromo was exiled to Boven-Digoel prison camp in Papua. He died in the camp of malaria in 1932. Kartodikromo, who preferred writing in Malay, experimented with new phrasings at a time when the state-owned publisher Balai Pustaka was attempting to standardise the language. According to literary critic Bakri Siregar, he was the first Indonesian writer to openly criticise the Dutch colonial government and the traditional form of feudalism practised in the country. For this vocal criticism, the Dutch government decried him as a \\"crazy\\" man who could spark unrest among the native populations. Biography =Early life and career= Kartodikromo was born in Blora, Central Java, Dutch East Indies, in 1890 to a low-ranking priyayi (noble) family. At the age of fifteen, he took up a job at the Nederlandsch-Indische Spoorweg, the national railway company of the Indies, in Semarang. In 1911 he chose to leave the company as he was disgusted by its racist policies, including the use of race as a basis for the amount paid in wages. Kartodikromo made his way to Bandung, West Java, where he found employment at Medan Prijaji, a newspaper run by Tirto Adhi Soerjo. When the paper was closed by the Dutch, in 1912 Kartodikromo went to Surakarta. There, he joined Sarekat Islam, an organisation of Muslim merchants, and found employment at the Sarekat Islam-backed weekly Saro Tomo. In 1914 he took lead of the magazine Doenia Bergerak. The paper was the mouthpiece of the Native Indonesian Journalists' Group (), which Kartodikromo led and had helped establish with Tjipto Mangoenkoesoemo and Darnakoesoemo. That same year, he published the three-volume work Mata Gelap (Dark Eyes); this led to a long polemic between Doenia Bergerak and the Chinese-owned Tjoen Tjioe in Surabaya due to perceived racism. While with Doenia Bergerak, Kartodikromo wrote an attack on the Dutch Advisor on Native Affairs R.A. Rinkes; in his editorial, he wrote that the Dutch loved themselves far more than the natives they were subjugating. On 26 January 1915, Kartodikromo came under investigation by the Justice Office of the Dutch East Indies for publishing several further anti-Dutch editorials. The journalist unsuccessfully attempted to raise money to protest this at the Dutch parliament in The Hague. He was convicted of revolutionary activity and sentenced to nine months at Mlaten Prison; however, due to public outcry he was released after 100 days. When Doenia Bergerak went bankrupt, Kartodipuro then headed the Saro Tomo. =Further career, exile, and death= Kartodikromo was soon chosen by Goenawan, chief editor of the daily Pantjaran Warta, to go to the Netherlands as a correspondent. In his five months there at the end of 1916 and beginning of 1917, the journalist published Boekoe Sebaran Jang Pertama (The First Publication Book). After his return to Indonesia, he became an editor for Pantjaran Warta and based himself in Batavia (now Jakarta). Within a month he was imprisoned again for his writing. On 21 February 1918 Kartodikromo was released from prison. He moved to Semarang and became a commissioner of the Sarekat Islam with Semaun; he also joined the newspaper Sinar Djawa (later Sinar Hindia). In a conference that year, Kartodikromo stated that there were two kinds of press in Indonesia: the \\"black press\\" (), which struggled against the imperialistic Dutch; and the \\"white press\\" (), which worked to subjugate the Indonesian people. In 1918 he published Student Hidjo (Student Green), which told of a young Indonesian student who falls in love while studying in the Netherlands despite already having a fianc√©e in Indonesia. The work, originally published as a serial, was novelised in 1919. Also in 1918 he published a collection of poems, Sair-sair Rempah (Poems on Spices). Kartodikromo published another novel, Matahariah, in 1919. It was based on the life of the Dutch spy Mata Hari. On 15 December 1919, Kartodikromo left Sinar Hindia and took a position as head of Soero Tamtomo, published by the Forestry Union Staff Union Wono Tamtomo. He was imprisoned for six months for one of his writings, Sjairnja Sentot (Sentot's Poem), with the paper. In 1921 Kartodikromo moved to Salatiga and became involved with the press there. He was sentenced to two years in a Batavian prison for another of his writings. In 1924, Kartodikromo published Rasa Merdika (A Sense of Independence), which dealt with a young man who goes against his priyayi father, a tool of the Dutch colonial government, and tries to find personal independence. Another novel, Cermin Buah Keroyalan (Mirror of the Fruit of Royalty), and stage play, Kromo Bergerak (Kromo is Moving), were published not long after. Kartodikromo was exiled to Boven-Digoel, Papua, in 1926 for his writings and involvement in the 1926 revolt led by the Communist Party of Indonesia. He died there of malaria on 18 March 1932. Themes and styles Most of Kartodikromo's fictional works took place in Bandung or Surabaya. He was an early Indonesian example of the social realist movement. Like most nationalist writers at the time, Kartodikromo preferred writing in Malay (the predecessor of modern Indonesian) rather than his native Javanese; however, he did write several pieces in Javanese. While the state-owned publisher Balai Pustaka was attempting to standardise Malay, Kartodikromo experimented with the language, using words, phrases, and scenes which had never before been used. Socialist literary critic Bakri Siregar writes that Kartodikromo drew on his experiences while visiting the Netherlands in writing Studen Hidjo. He also writes that, unlike writers published by Balai Pustaka, Kartodikromo was heavily against the \\"white superiority\\" which the Dutch impressed upon native Indonesians; this was achieved through showcasing the \\"depravity of bourgeois morals and the Dutch colonials.\\" Reception Due to his vocal criticism of the Dutch, the East Indies government banned Kartodikromo's books several times. In response to his critiques in Doenia Bergerak, they described him as a \\"crazy\\" man who could spark unrest among the native populations. Kartodikromo himself enjoyed baiting the colonial government, reportedly inviting his readers to work together and criticise the Dutch for their \\"mismanagement and caprice\\". Siregar described Kartodikromo as the first Indonesian writer to openly criticise the Dutch colonial government and the traditional form of feudalism practised in the country; he also notes that the writer was the first Indonesian to consciously depict class struggles in his works. As Siregar considered Indonesian literature to have been born from a nationalist understanding, he considered Marco one of the first truly Indonesian writers. Hendrik Maier, a lecturer at Leiden University, writes that Kartodikromo was \\"primarily inspired by dreams and ideals\\", noting that the writer intended to create a community of politically aware Indonesians to work against the colonial government in solidarity and equality. Kartodikromo described his ideal political state as having \\"\\" (\\"the same standards, the same feelings\\").

He was proclaimed as the founder of Pagan for the first time by Hmannan Yazawin, the Royal Chronicle of Konbaung Dynasty in 1832. The introduction of Thamoddarit, whose lineage Hmannan traces to the Sakya clan of the Buddha as the founder of Pagan, was part of the early Konbaung kings' efforts to move away from then prevailing pre-Buddhist origin narrative of the monarchy. Burmese chronicles down to the 18th century had traced to another legendary figure Pyusawhti, a descendant of a solar spirit and a dragon princess.Lieberman 2003: 196Than Tun 1964: ix‚Äìx Legend =Out of Sri Ksetra= According to Hmannan, Thamoddarit was a nephew of Thupyinnya, the last king of Sri Ksetra Kingdom. In 94 CE, a civil war broke out between the Pyu and the Kanyan, two of the three main ethnic groups of the kingdom. (The Mranma (Burmans) were the third.) The Pyu initially emerged victorious over the Kanyan. But the victors soon broke into three rival groups, and a second round of war ensued. Taking advantage of the confusion, a fourth group, the Mon of Lower Burma drove all indigenous groups out of Sri Ksetra.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 185‚Äì188 =Wandering years= Thamoddarit led one of the refugee groups out of Sri Ksetra, and wandered on along the Irrawaddy for over a dozen years. They spent three years at Taungnyo near Sri Ksetra before they were driven out by the Mon. They spent another six years at Pantaung but the Kanyan drove them out. They then went to Mindon for another three years, and in 107 CE, finally stopped at the location of Pagan (Bagan). He incorporated nineteen villages in the area, and founded the city of Pagan. His dynasty became known as the Pagan Dynasty. =Reign= Thamoddarit had a long reign at Pagan. In the 22nd year of his reign, in 149 CE, a young man by the name of Pyusawhti became famous by performing daring feats. According to Hmannan, Pyusawhti was a descendant of the Second Tagaung Dynasty, ultimately from the first (mythical) Buddhist king of the world, Maha Sammata. But prior Burmese chronicles had identified him as a descendant of a solar spirit and a dragon princess. Thamoddarit married his daughter Thiri Sanda Dewi to Pyusawhti, and made him the heir apparent. He died three years later in 152 CE at the age of 76. Pyusawhti refused to take the throne; instead he gave the throne to his tutor Yathekyaung, who ruled until 167 CE.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 189‚Äì201 See also * Tagaung Kingdom * Sri Ksetra Kingdom * Pagan Dynasty Notes References  Category:Burmese monarchs Category:Pagan dynasty ","title":"Thamoddarit"},{"id":"35477378","text":"Glyphipterix autopetes is a species of sedge moth in the genus Glyphipterix.

It appears to have been established in the late 2nd century CE, as it contained six gold coins of the Kushan king Vima Kadphises ruled c. 113-127 CE, the father of Kanishka I, and two from Huvishka, Kanishka's son, who is thought to have ruled c. 150-190 CE. None of the coins appear very worn, and the two Huvishka coins look to be in almost mint condition.Bivar (2009)Falk (2001), pp. 121-136. Description The Guldara stupa is about 22 km or 14 miles south of Kabul. It is a large stupa, a solid mass made of rough stone and mud and is probably the best- preserved in Afghanistan. A small stupa, a replica of the main one, is set on the side of the hill and, nearby, are the remnants of a fortified monastery. Facing the monastery \\"was a group of very large standing figures\\" of which the excavators only found two large feet which have since disappeared.Dupree (1977) Close to the village of Shiwaki nearby is another monastery and stupa.Vogelsang (2002), pp. 153-154. The stupa itself stands on a square base with two cylindrical domes topped with a dome above it. > \\"The base is decorated with false Corinthian columns flanking, on three > sides, a central niche, and on the southwest side, a staircase leading to > the top of the base. Statues once occupied the niches. The decoration of the > first drum is similar to that of the base but the second drum is more > elaborately embellished with a false arcade of alternating semicircular and > trapezoidal arches. The motif between the arches represents the umbrella > mast with which stupas are usually crowned. The walls present a fine example > of Kushan workmanship known as \\"diaper masonry\\", consisting of thin neatly > placed layers of schist interspersed with large blocks of stone. The > construction of the capitals is also especially interesting and most > effective in its simpolicity. The entire stupa was originally plastered and > painted ochre-yellow with red designs.\\"Dupree (1977) Chapter 5. > \\"In a valley called Guldara, or the vale of flowers, on the opposite side of > this ridge, is a tope which was also examined by M. Honigberger. As he had > penetrated only the basement, I directed it to be re-opened at the line > where the superstructure reposes on it. My search was successful, and at the > centre were discovered in an apartment mingled with ashes, gold medals of > Kadphises, and of the earlier princes of the Kanerki family, which it was > interesting to meet with in company with each other, and numerous ornaments > of gold, apparently buttons, resembling such articles even to being provided > with shanks.\\"Masson (1841), p. 115. Reliquary and contents Between a half and three-quarters of the way up the stupa there was a small chamber containing a reliquary and some treasure. The 19th century British adventurer Charles Masson opened the chamber and recovered eight gold Kushan coins some other gold ornaments.Dupree (1977) As well as the gold coins mentioned above there were also ninety-six gold buttons with bronze loops with an average diameter of 2.1 cm., and \\"a small quantity of ashes and fragments of bones\\".Bivar (2009) Footnotes References * A.

He is like a newly formed beautiful blue cloud. The yellow robe on his body appears like delightful lighting. : He is the consort of the daughter of Sri Janak (Sri Sita), the embodiment of sacredness.‡••2‡•• :O mind, sing praises of Sri Ram, a friend of the poor. He is the lord of the solar dynasty.

It is part of the second belt Lyon and more generally the system Sere de Rivieres. This belt of forts included the forts of Bron, Vancia itself, Feyzin and Mont Verdun. History This pentagonal fort covers about 18 hectares. Located on the plateau and peak Vancia on Dombes to 332 meters, it is disposed between the height of Mont Verdun and Fort Meyzieu. It has been built primarily for the purpose of resisting German and Italian attack from Bourg- en-Bresse, but also in order to confine a potential revolt of the city of Lyon. The fort consists of seven batteries of 50 guns and covered by three batteries: Sermenaz, Neyron and Sathonay. Its organization is very similar plans of the forts of Bron and Feyzin, it is not constructed of concrete but in stone, surrounded by a dry ditch along a kilometer in a building concrete will be added to the barracks of the rider in 1895 . The fort was built on the ground and covered by a result of soil from outside. The fort had a capacity of 800 soldiers divided into two two-story barracks and is 16,000 m¬≤, with fifty pieces, two coal-fired ovens, shops and arsenals, two stables, four kitchens, a bakery, four wells, a water tank, a laundry, an infirmary, a forge, and fifty guns. It cost at the time of building 3 million gold francs. The barracks are composed, on the ground floor of a barn or a shop, with the garrison of the rooms upstairs. Each room has an area of 120 square meters, and housed 25 men arranged in two bunk beds and an officer in a single bed. Meals were served in your room, the bread was suspended in each to protect from rats. Grooves within each window can barricade in case of danger. The path along the barracks is called the street walls and was crossed by a rail allowing, through horse-drawn wagons, to supply the guns quickly. Two magazines of 70t and 68T provide ammunition to eleven shooting platforms which are placed at the top of the structure on the ridge of high fire and bunkers indirect fire mortar type. Because of the ever-present risk of explosion of the powder by spark, access and layout of magazines included some points: * Skylights can move inside; * movements in the magazine were made in wooden shoes; * bins allow sand to absorb moisture. Access to the fort was controlled by a caponier placed on a ravelin built into the rock in front of the pit itself crossed by a crane on rollers. A thick wooden door studded prevents access of the caponier entrance. An iron gate will be added in 1906 before the bridge. The fort served during the First World War to the French troops, a huge time sink collective is still visible today. Before 1939 and after World War II, it served as a logistics centre consolidation for reservists and the volunteers, as well as deposit. In 1942, when the fort was still in the free zone. It was used for testing rocket EA-41 by Colonel Jean-Jacques Barre. The fort served as a prison for Germans towards the end of World War II, including opponents of the regime of Franco as well as Habib Bourguiba, former president of Tunisia. It remained the property of the army until 1999. Today Unoccupied for a long time, the fort is now occupied by dense vegetation. The fort of Vancia currently depend on a single-purpose municipal association, owned by the municipalities of Sathonay-Village and Rillieux-la-Pape . The fort served as occasional training fields for the police, emergency services. The shooting center has always remained property of the Department of Defense. The fort is regularly open for Heritage Days. The fort was occupied illegally from 4 February 2011 at 18 May 2011 by a group called The fallow Vancia, strong collective self (CFA), the police carried out the evictions and deposited concrete blocks outside the gates and access. center700pxthumbPanoramic view from the front gate from left to right: Ravelin, a bunker, grid, bridge, caponier gate, all surrounded by a moat.

Conflict After claiming that Sudan had been harassing its forces from the air and the use of artillery, South Sudan ordered its forces to attack the Sudanese army in the Heglig area in retaliation. The Sudan People's Liberation Army launched an offensive northwards, claiming they were chasing retreating Sudanese army units that had attacked South Sudanese territory. The forces from Sudan held defensive positions in and around Heglig and clashes ensued when the South Sudanese army reached the area and engaged them. After a day of fierce clashes, Sudan admitted that they had been defeated by the South's armed forces despite having put up stiff resistance against \\"Huge, well equipped forces\\" from South Sudan. South Sudanese forces began reinforcing their positions in Heglig on 13 April, whilst Sudan continued to mobilise its own forces. According to the South Sudanese government, the frontlines had remained static during the day. Sudanese forces claimed to be advancing on Heglig and that the situation would be dealt with \\"within hours.\\" A spokesman of the Sudanese government said that its army was on the outskirts of Heglig, while South Sudan's government said that it would defend themselves if attacked. The Sudanese government spokesman also added that South Sudan failed to control \\"all of South Kordofan state.\\" Sudanese warplanes bombed Heglig on 15 April, with Southern officials accusing the North of \\"bombing the central processing facility to rubble\\". Sudan strongly denied the claims.http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/04/14/2748242/sudanese-war-planes- bombard-bentiu.html On 20 April 2012 the Sudanese armed forces entered Heglig and controlled the oil field The Sudanese army claimed to have killed over 1,000 South Sudanese soldiers at Heglig. The death toll however is impossible to verify but an AFP correspondent in Heglig said the putrid bodies of dead South Sudanese lay beneath trees scattered about the area. He said the number of bodies was so large they were \\"uncountable\\". He also said, the corpses bore the South Sudanese flag on their uniforms. Earlier in the occupation one Southern soldier in Bentiu, capital of the South's Unity state, said: \\"There are so many bodies at the front line, so many dead\\" that it is impossible to bury them or bring them back.

It was named by after Erland Samuel Bring who studied a similar construction in 1786 in a Promotionschrift submitted to the University of Lund. The automorphism group of the curve is the symmetric group S5 of order 120, given by permutations of the 5 coordinates. This is the largest possible automorphism group of a genus 4 complex curve. The curve can be realized as a triple cover of the sphere branched in 12 points, and is the Riemann surface associated to the small stellated dodecahedron. It has genus 4. The full group of symmetries (including reflections) is the direct product S_{5}\\\\times\\\\mathbb{Z}_{2}, which has order 240. Fundamental domain and systole Bring's curve can be obtained as a Riemann surface by associating sides of a hyperbolic icosagon (see fundamental polygon). The identification pattern is given in the adjoining diagram. The icosagon (of area 12\\\\pi, by the Gauss-Bonnet theorem) can be tessellated by 240 (2,4,5) triangles. The actions that transport one of these triangles to another give the full group of automorphisms of the surface (including reflections). Discounting reflections, we get the 120 automorphisms mentioned in the introduction. Note that 120 is less that 252, the maximum number of orientation preserving automorphisms allowed for a genus 4 surface, by Hurwitz's automorphism theorem. Therefore, Bring's surface is not a Hurwitz surface. This also tells us that there does not exist a Hurwitz surface of genus 4. The fundamental icosagon for Bring's surface, complete with side identifications. The full group of symmetries has the following presentation: :\\\\langle r,\\\\,s,\\\\,t\\\\,\\\\,r^5=s^2=t^2=rtrt=stst=(rs)^{4}=(sr^{3}sr^{2})^{2}=e\\\\rangle, where e is the identity action, r is a rotation of order 5 about the centre of the fundamental polygon, s is a rotation of order 2 at the vertex where 4 (2,4,5) triangles meet in the tessellation, and t is reflection in the real line. From this presentation, information about the linear representation theory of the symmetry group of Bring's surface can be computed using GAP. In particular, the group has four 1 dimensional, four 4 dimensional, four 5 dimensional, and two 6 dimensional irreducible representations, and we have :4(1^2)+4(4^2)+4(5^2)+2(6^2)=4+64+100+72=240 as expected. The systole of the surface has length :12\\\\sinh^{-1}\\\\left(\\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\sqrt{\\\\tfrac{1}{2}(\\\\sqrt{5}-1)}\\\\right)\\\\approx4.60318. Similarly to the Klein quartic, Bring's surface does not maximize the systole length among compact Riemann surfaces in its topological category (that is, surfaces having the same genus) despite maximizing the size of the automorphism group. The systole is presumably maximized by the surface referred to a M4 in . The systole length of M4 is :2\\\\cosh^{-1}\\\\left(\\\\tfrac{1}{2}(5+3\\\\sqrt{3})\\\\right)\\\\approx4.6245, and has multiplicity 36. Spectral theory Little is known about the spectral theory of Bring's surface, however, it could potentially be of interest in this field. The Bolza surface and Klein quartic have the largest symmetry groups among compact Riemann surfaces of constant negative curvature in genera 2 and 3 respectively, and thus it has been conjectured that they maximize the first positive eigenvalue in the Laplace spectrum. There is strong numerical evidence to support this hypothesis, particularly in the case of the Bolza surface, although providing a rigorous proof is still an open problem. Following this pattern, one may reasonably conjecture that Bring's surface maximizes the first positive eigenvalue of the Laplacian (among surfaces in its topological class).

Philmont is about across (east to west) at its widest point, and about long (north to south). There are no mountains to the south or east of Philmont. The interior of the ranch is mountainous but a small part of the eastern area is prairie. Geography Philmont's lowest point is the southeast corner at and the highest point is the peak of Baldy Mountain, located on the ranch's northwest boundary, at . The average rainfall at Philmont ranges from around Base Camp to in the backcountry. There are nine major watersheds at Philmont - the Rayado River, Urraca Creek, Cimarroncito Creek, Sawmill Creek, the Cimarron (La Flecha) River, Turkey Creek, Dean Canyon, the Ponil River, and Ute Creek. =Geological history= The Tooth of Time, as well as Baldy Mountain, Betty's Bra, Lover's Leap, Cathedral Rock, Hogback Ridge, and many of the ridges in the northwest of the ranch, is an igneous intrusion of dacite porphyry formed in the Paleogene Period of the Cenozoic Era some 22-40 million years ago. These intrusions were formed when magma from deep within the Earth rose through older rock layers and slowly cooled. Over many thousands of years, the older sedimentary rock eroded and left the harder igneous formation. The sedimentary rock, generally shale, acted as a mold for the intrusive magma, causing it to harden and cool where the sedimentary rock was strongest. The gold veins were discovered in between the dacite porphyry and shale. =Geological features= The Tooth of Time, an icon of Philmont Scout Ranch. Aside from Baldy, the ranch contains a number of prominent peaks. The South Country is home to a series of six difficult peaks, namely Mount Phillips, Comanche Peak, Big Red, Bear Mountain, Black Mountain, and Schaefers Peak, as well as Trail Peak, which is popular for its relative ease, its nearness to Beaubien, and the wreckage of the crash of a B-24 bomber in 1942 near its summit. Of the ranch's various peaks with trail access, Black Mountain is widely considered the most difficult, followed closely by Baldy and Big Red. The most recognisable landmark is the Tooth of Time at , a granite monolith, composed of two laccoliths, protruding vertically from an east-west ridge. Tooth of Time Ridge, and the latitude line on which it sits, mark the boundary between the central and southern sections of Philmont. The boundary between the central and northern sections is around U.S. Route 64, which runs just south of the narrowest part of the 'I'-shape, which is only a few miles across. Other prominent landmarks on the ranch include Grizzly Tooth, Window Rock, Deer Lake Mesa, and Urraca Mesa. The Tooth rises prominently from the valley floor, some below, creating a sheer vertical face unable to support substantial plant life. Both its pinkish-gray color and its unusual shape make it a particularly notable geological landmark. It was well- known among the overland traders on the Santa Fe Trail, who used it to mark the final seven-day push to Santa Fe, New Mexico. Baldy Mountain, or Mount Baldy, is the highest peak in the Cimarron Range, a subrange of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains of New Mexico. It rises abruptly, with of vertical relief over , from the Moreno Valley to the west and has a total elevation of . Copper and gold were mined in the area starting in 1866, and the top of Baldy Mountain was developed as the Mystic Lode copper mine. Mine workings and prospects are still evident on the slopes of the mountain as well. There are about of mines in the whole mountain. Mount Phillips, formerly called Clear Creek Mountain was renamed in 1960 in honor of the then living Waite Phillips, who donated the area to the Boy Scouts of America. It is located in Colfax County about south of Baldy Mountain in the Cimarron Range, a subrange of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains of New Mexico. It is the second highest peak in Philmont Scout Ranch in the central country on the western perimeter. It is an easy hike from Comanche Peak, but it is a much steeper ascent from Clear Creek to its summit. Urraca Mesa is a large mesa reaching an elevation of and has coordinates of N 36.413647 and W 104.998059.http://www.mountainzone.com/mountains/detail.asp?fid=4606956 Urraca Mesa Summit - New Mexico Mountain Peak Information The mesa has a long \\"history\\" of mythical and supernatural associations, dating to the local indigenous tribes. Ecology =Flora= Philmont supports a wide variety of flora. There are five of the Merriam life zones at Philmont - the Arctic, Hudsonian, Canadian, Transition, and Upper Sonoran zones. Trees at Philmont range from the plains cottonwood to the quaking aspen to the ponderosa pine. Wildflowers at Philmont include prickly poppy, shrubby cinquefoil, skyrocket (scarlet gilia), fairy slipper, blue columbine, and pinedrops. There are also a number of grasses, lichens, ferns, and mushrooms. Musk thistle, leafy spurge, and tamarisk are all invasive species found at Philmont. In addition to the natural flora, Philmont grows alfalfa hay for livestock. There are irrigated for cropland and another for plant forage. The ranch also allows selective timbering to promote healthy forests. Backslopes of new trails and campsites are reseeded to control erosion and prevent the spread of invasive species. =Fauna= There are approximately 125 black bears on the ranch. The bears spend most of the summer looking for food, mostly plants like grass, acorns, and berries but also grubs, small animals, and carrion. Philmont also has mountain lions which feed on the native elk, deer, porcupines, mice, skunk, and rabbits. Western diamondback rattlesnakes are also found in Philmont. During the off-season, Philmont allows selective deer, elk, turkey, bear, antelope, and mountain lion hunting. Philmont also has herds of cattle that rotate through several backcountry pastures and the buffalo pasture supports one hundred adult bison as well as their calves.

He was prefect of the Vatican Library for several years and secretary of the Fifth Lateran Council. Biography Tommaso Inghirami was born in Volterra in 1470, the son of Paolo Inghirami and of his wife Lucrezia Barlettani. His father, a prominent man in Volterra, was killed in a political uprising in 1472. After the murder, Paolo's children were taken to Florence and raised under the protection of Lorenzo de' Medici, who soon recognized his scholarly potential and in 1483 sent him to Rome under the protection of two of his uncles, both well-placed clerics. In 1486, Inghirami played Phaedra in the first performance of Seneca's Phaedra since ancient times, staged by Giovanni Sulpizio da Veroli and Raffaele Riario, with support from the Roman Academy of Julius Pomponius Laetus. After this performance, he was known by the nickname \\"Phaedra\\" for the rest of his life, though he preferred the masculine form \\"Phaedrus\\". A member of the Roman intellectual elite, Inghirami was praised for his Latin oratory by Ludovico Ariosto, Pietro Bembo, Baldassare Castiglione, Paolo Giovio, Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, and Angelo Colocci. Inghirami was ordained as a deacon of the Papal Chapel in April 1493. In 1495, he was invited to deliver the address ‚Äì he titled it Panegyricus in memoriam divi Thomae Aquinatis ‚Äì for the annual celebration of the feast day of St. Thomas Aquinas held by the Dominican Studium generale, the future Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum) at the Basilica of Santa Maria sopra Minerva in Rome. In 1496, Inghirami was sent as part of a delegation from Pope Alexander VI to Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, whom he met in Innsbruck on 14 March 1497. The emperor was so impressed by an oration Inghirami gave that he named him poet laureate and count palatine. On 16 January of the following year, he gave a much-noted eulogy in the presence of the entire papal court at a Memorial Mass for the young John, Prince of Asturias, son of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabel of Spain, held at the Church of San Giacomo degli Spagnuoli. In 1505, he eulogized his teacher, Pietro Menzi da Vicenza, with an oration that denounced the corruption of the papal court, praising by contrast both the deceased and the newly elected Pope Julius II. This and other eulogies he delivered were published shortly after he delivered them. In 1508, Inghirami suffered injuries when the mule he was riding collided with an oxcart loaded with grain. The event was recorded in an ex voto, a devotional offering he commissioned to express his gratitude for surviving the accident. Attributed to Raphael, it is a small oil painting on a panel; it depicts the accident, with Inghirami trapped under the cart's wheels. It originally hung in the Lateran Cathedral. And art historians credit Inghirami with authorship of the program for Raphael‚Äôs frescoes that decorate the Stanza della Segnatura, which establishes a relationship between ancient Roman and Renaissance culture, between the rule of the Roman Emperor Augustus and his modern counterpart, Pope Julius II. Inghirami met Desiderius Erasmus in 1509 and they became lifelong friends and correspondents. Erasmus noted Inghirami was more famous as an orator than writer. In 1528, long after Inghirami's death, Erasmus used Inghirami as an example of the danger of restricting one's use of Latin to that of Cicero, citing Inghirami's 1509 Good Friday sermon in which he eschewed Church Latin and treated Christ as a self- sacrificing hero rather than the Redeemer. As a humanist scholar engaged in celebrating the ancient world he became head of a new theater company in 1510. Two years later he organized the festivities surrounding the alliance between Pope Julius and the Holy Roman Emperor. The next year he directed a performance of Plautus' Poenulus in Latin. School of Athens In 1510, Inghirami was appointed Prefect of the Palatine Library. As secretary to the College of Cardinals he served as secretary for the papal conclave of 1513 which elected Pope Leo X. About this time he commissioned Raphael to paint his portrait. He appears in the robes of a canon of St. Peter's Basilica. Raphael had already, in 1509, used Inghirami as the model for the Greek philosopher Epicurus in his fresco The School of Athens for the papal apartments. He served as secretary of the Fifth Lateran Council under Pope Julius II and, after his death, under Pope Leo X. Inghirami was overweight at least in his final decades, as shown in Raphael's works. He suffered from strabismus, the failure of the eyes to align, a condition that Raphael disguised in his portrait by focusing his gaze away from the viewer at some unseen superior or inspiration. Contemporary letters hint he was homosexual or state it as plain fact, an interpretation supported by Raphael's \\"School of Athens\\" where Inghirami is embraced from behind by a half-hidden male figure, and his unusual feminine nickname of Phaedra. Inghirami died on either September 5 or 6 in 1516.

It is celebrated as one of the most outstanding works of modernist domestic architecture of the mid 20th century in Victoria, a time of great experimentation, and one of the most notable designs by Roy Grounds, one of the most well known and influential modern architects in Victoria.  Description  The house is an exercise in pure platonic geometries in plan, a perfectly circular glass walled courtyard within a square of solid brick walls, broken only by the front door (and a back door to the kitchen). A broad flat roof with wide eaves floats above the external wall on continuous highlight windows. Internally the rooms are divided by radial walls, which stop short of the courtyard, the focus of the house. There are four flats behind the house that reach down the block, the first being a smaller single level studio unit, while the other three are matching larger double storey two bedroom units. These three step towards the driveway, allowing easy access to undercover parking, and increasingly larger courtyard gardens. While they do not have the geometry or oriental repose of the main house, they include distinctive features such as the angled carport walls, small slatted balconies, and a double height main space, with double storey window wall facing the courtyard gardens.  Significance  The complete focus on the internal courtyard, creates an inward looking, almost eastern character. This oriental influence continues to the external design, with strong solid walls, topped by projecting eaves floating above the highlight windows, and a single central large door with oversized knocker. The original planting of the courtyard with persimmon and bamboo also displays an eastern influence. The house is one of series by Roy Grounds built in the same year that explored pure geometric shapes; this house was square, the Henty House in Frankston was circular, while the Leyser House in Kew was an elevated triangle. The Roy Grounds House is one of the most well known Mid Century Modernist houses in Melbourne. It received the only award granted in 1954, the Victorian Architecture Medal, which in turn was the only award granted between the awards ceasing in 1942 and restarting in 1964. in 1989 it was one of about 30 houses representing the range of Victorian house styles that were featured as models in the exhibition 'Home Sweet Home: Changes in Victorian Domestic Architecture, 1839-1989' staged by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects and the Museum of Victoria in 1989. In 2001 it was added to the Victorian Heritage Register. The house is considered a prototype for Grounds' design for the National Gallery of Victoria (NGV) in 1959, which also features a rectangular masonry volume, central door, highlight windows with a floating roof, and central courtyards. Since the mid 2000s the house has been rediscovered and elements restored, and is a widely known and celebrated, with owners passionate about its significance.

Peter (Paresh Rawal), armed with three herculean sons, goes to all ends to make sure Maria and Johnny never marry, until one day, hope comes in the form of a silent, strong but always-hungry man, Kallu a.k.a. Sam (Nana Patekar). One sudden day, Johnny and his family find Kallu in their well. They get him out and feed him dinner.

So to get this, he had set the house on fire. In the meantime, the other man runs away with the cross. Johnny and Sam catch him in the field. The other man confesses that he was the one who had raped and murdered the lady and told the police that Sam had done it. Sam beats the man to death. Sam injures Johnny who was trying to take the cross back to the church, but falls again into the well. Johnny, feeling grateful for Sam's earlier help, rescues him. Sam is walking with the cross when Johnny reminds him of the love Sam received from his family. Hearing this, Sam leaves the cross there only. Johnny brings the cross to Church, but people accuse him as thief. Johnny is unable to prove his innocence. Suddenly, Sam appears and puts the dead body of the other man as thief. The village accepts this. As decided, if Johnny gets the golden cross for Church, he marries Maria. Johnny tells Sam now he is a permanent member of the family.

Prior to the artistic sculpting, the limestone was prepared by a group of engineers and miners, then the \\"actual artistic carving of the fa√ßade\\" was rendered by Anselmo Bayang Day-ag, an Ifugao artist/sculptor from the Cordillera Administrative Region. The construction project began in 1968 but was interrupted. The project was continued in 1971 by another Lions Club president, Robert Webber, and was unveiled in 1972. Forerunners The forerunner of the man-made Lion's Head was a \\"large rock\\" described to be \\"naturally shaped like a lion\\", which prior to 1972 was the landmark that tourists observe along Kennon Road towards Baguio City. However, according to the article Lion's Head in Baguio City - Philippines, the current Lion's Head landmark was also a limestone naturally shaped like a \\"male lion, with a mane\\". Restoration It has undergone several coloration changes before restoring it to acquiring its traditional gold and black color. It was at some points in time painted white and brown, or yellow. It had also undergone restoration after being damaged by vandalism and by the earthquake in Northern Luzon in 1990.

The entire watershed lies within the urban growth boundary of the City of Salem. Pringle Creek's tributaries include Clark Creek, West Fork Pringle Creek, West Middle Fork and East Fork.Hemesath, Chapter 2, pp. 2-6 Course Pringle Creek consists of a network of small streams with courses greatly altered since the 19th century by urban development. The streams flow on the surface in places, in pipes and culverts in other places, and have been otherwise modified by artificial inflows and diversions.Hemesath, Chapter 3, pp. 6-8 West Fork Pringle Creek begins in springs southwest of the main stem and flows generally north and slightly east to its confluence with East Fork Pringle Creek near 14th Street and Oxford Street. East Fork Pringle Creek and West Middle Fork Pringle Creek drain farm fields near Interstate 5 southeast of downtown Salem. East Fork Pringle Creek flows generally northwest, receiving the north-flowing West Middle Fork from the left slightly upstream of the larger stream's confluence with West Fork Pringle Creek. Clark Creek, another small tributary rising south of the city's center, enters Pringle Creek from the left at Bush's Pasture Park. Pringle Creek then flows between the park and Deepwood Estate, crosses under Mission Street, flows between Salem Cardiology and the site of the former Oregon School for the Blind on the left and Salem Hospital and Pringle Park on the right. After passing under the hospital, the creek receives Shelton Ditch, which carries water diverted from Mill Creek, from the right. Pringle Creek then flows through Pringle Plaza to Mirror Pond, where the Mill Race, another diversion from Mill Creek, enters from the right. The combined waters then flow under Commercial Street and a former Boise Cascade mill to Willamette Slough on the Willamette River. Watershed Pringle Creek from Liberty Street in Salem Pringle Creek's drainage basin lies within the Salem urban growth boundary. Small watersheds that border the basin are Croisan Creek to the west, Willamette Slough East to the west and northwest, Mill Creek to the north and east, and Battle Creek to the south.HDR Engineering, Chapter 1, p. 2 About 60 percent of the watershed was developed as urban in 2002, while about 27 percent was used for farming. The main crops grown in the basin are grass seed and hay. McNary Field (Salem Municipal Airport) and the site of the former Fairview Training Center are in the Pringle Creek basin. History The creek is named for Virgil K. Pringle, who emigrated from Missouri to Oregon in 1846 and settled a donation land claim near the stream. The Southern Pacific Railroad, which later built a South Salem station in the vicinity, changed its name to Pringle in 1925. The station closed in the 1980s, but the name is still used by a post office branch and a shopping center.

It was later proposed to be built in Pasig amidst backlash over the original planned site. It was planned to be a memorial to the 100th anniversary of Philippine Independence. Architecture and design The Centennial Tower was designed by Filipino architect Francisco Ma√±osa. It was planned to have a height of or equivalent to a 100 storey building. The proposed height was about 2 times higher than the Rufino Tower the tallest building in Metro Manila in 1996. The structure designed by Ma√±osa was inspired from the sulo or bamboo torch to highlight the country's Asian heritage and character. The diameter of the tower's base was to measure . A restaurant was to be hosted by tower at two-thirds up from its base. Government agencies and private firms were to occupy the tower for office use which includes at least 18 firms expressing interest to use the upper portion of the tower for telecommunications use. Planned construction According to a 1996 report, the tower was to be constructed and financed by German firm, Walter Bau-AG and was to cost around $200 million or around . If the tower was constructed the German firm was to operate the tower for 23 years after which it will transfer ownership and operations to the Philippine government. The Department of Transportation and Communications was the lead government agency for the construction project. In July 1996, Walter Bau-AG has expressed that it was capable to finish the construction of the building by 1998 but such plans were jeopardized due to the indecision of the administration of Fidel Ramos to green light the construction of the tower. Earlier in March 1995, the firm that would construct the building was reported to be Malaysia-based Internal Finance and Marketing Corp. at a cost of . Proposed location The Centennial Tower was to be constructed in lieu of the skating rink at the center of the Agrifina Circle at Rizal Park due to its historical value, accessibility and aesthetic importance. The site was chosen over other six proposed sites - Corregidor, Fort Bonifacio, Clark Freeport Zone, Cavite, Subic Bay Freeport Zone and Greenhills. The first site was found to be too inaccessible to the public, Fort Bonifacio and Cavite are within the air corridor of landing planes, Clark and Subic are surrounded by laharlands which the proponents of the project find unappealing for potential visitors of the tower and Greenhills was found to be overcrowded. Rizal Park was chosen due to its accessibility to tourists and the general public, the popular sunset at Manila Bay and the site's historical connections such as the execution of Jose Rizal which led to the Philippine Revolution. In April 1996, the National Centennial Commission decided to move the site of the tower to a lot owned by the Metro Manila Development Authority in the corner of Julia Vargas and Meralco Avenues in Pasig from the original controversial site at the Agrifina Circle. However the construction of the project never began. Reception The chosen site was a subject of criticism with critics saying the tower might \\"desecrate\\" the site. Senators Blas Ople and Ernesto Maceda has suggested the tower to be built at the Quezon Memorial Circle or Fort Bonifacio instead of Rizal Park, where the Rizal Monument might be dwarfed by the structure. Senator Gloria Macapagal Arroyo called for the scrapping of the project altogether saying while she supports effort to improve telecommunications in the country she described the project as a \\"capricious\\" undertaking amidst the country's more urgent needs. Ma√±osa answering to criticisms said that the tower will occupy the fourth quadrant facing Taft Avenue and it will be far enough from the Rizal Monument's quadrant. The architect remarked that the tower was \\"tall but not wide\\". He insists that the tower will boost the historic significance of Rizal Park and will encourage more tourists to visit the park. It was reported that the tower was to be constructed in an unstable base but Walter Bau-AG said it conducted soil analysis and guaranteed that the soil was stable and added that it had enough experience, resource and technology for the tower's construction.

The team, however, has not competed in a match recognised by FIFA, the sport's international governing body. A senior national team is inactive, but an under-20 team has played in numerous matches. Further development of football in the country faces challenges found across Africa, including inequality and limited access to education for women. A women's football programme did not exist in Burundi until 2000, and only 455 players had registered for participation on the national level by 2006. Team In 1985, almost no country in the world had a women's national football team. While the sport grew in popularity worldwide in the ensuing years, Burundi did not have an official team until more than two decades later. By 2009, however, Burundi had a FIFA-recognised senior national team nicknamed the Swallows and a FIFA-recognised Burundi women's under-20 national team. The under-20 team played one international match in 2002, one in 2004 and one in 2006. The senior national football team has never competed in a FIFA-sanctioned fixture and has not competed at the Women's World Cup. The team was one of 200 preparing for a qualification tournament for the cup in 2007, but did not play in the competition. The team has withdrawn from numerous other events. Burundi was to play in the 2008 African Women's Championship but withdrew from the tournament, giving the Democratic Republic of the Congo an automatic qualification. The team also withdrew from the 2010 and 2012 editions of the Africa Women Cup of Nations before the first-round qualifiers. Burundi has not participated in other major events on the continent, including the 2011 All-Africa Games. As of March 2012, the team was not ranked by FIFA. Burundi was scheduled to participate in a competition in 2007 organised by the Confederation of African Football (CAF) in Zanzibar. Nicholas Musonye, the secretary of the Council for East and Central Africa Football Associations (Cecafa), said of the event, \\"CAF wants to develop women's football in this region in recognition of the milestones Cecafa has achieved over the years. CAF appreciates what Cecafa has done despite the hardships the association has gone through, from financial problems to political instability in member states and poor management of associations. Member states in the Cecafa region have not taken women's football seriously. CAF now wants to sponsor a long-term campaign to attract women from this region into the game.\\" The competition was canceled due to lack of funds. Background and development The development of women's football in Africa faces several challenges, including limited access to education, poverty amongst women, inequalities and human rights abuses. Many quality female footballers leave their home countries for better opportunities elsewhere. Another issue facing women's football is institutional. Most of the funding for the sport in Africa comes from FIFA, not from national football federations. The Football Federation of Burundi, the country's national association, created a woman's football programme in 2000. By 2006, there were just 455 registered women players, and the absence of a thriving women's game has been an obstacle for the national team. Lydia Nsekera is the head of the national football association. Outside the national federation, the Commission nationale du football f√©minin was established by the 1990s, and a league and women's teams were organised in the same period in Bujumbura.

Football is organised by the Djiboutian Football Federation, with women's football formally organised in the country in 2002, and a national team was later created. The country has no women's youth national teams. Djibouti has only played in one FIFA recognised match, which they lost to Kenya by a score of 7‚Äì0. The team is unranked. The development of women's football in the country faces both national and regional issues that impede the team's potential success. Background and history The country became independent in 1977. The Djiboutian Football Federation was founded in 1977 and joined FIFA in 1994. Football is one of the most popular sports in the country. Women's football development in Africa has to deal with several challenges that impact the ability to develop a high level of play, including limited access to education, poverty amongst women in the wider society, and fundamental inequality present in the society that occasionally allows for female specific human rights abuses. When high level women's players are developed, many leave the country seeking greater opportunity in Northern Europe or the United States. Another issue facing women's football in Africa is that most of the money for the game does not come from national football federations but instead from FIFA. By 1985, few countries had their own women's national football teams. Djibouti was no exception: women's football was not officially organised in the country until 2002 and then, only for players sixteen years and older. As of 2009, there were only eight women's clubs for these players in the country. There is a regional and national women's competition, which was established in 2007. The league provided the first opportunity for women outside the capital and major cities to play football. The country has a women's national team but has no youth teams, meaning no U17 or U20 teams. 12% of the money from the FIFA Financial Assistance Programme (FAP) is targeted at the technical development of the game, which includes women's football, sport medicine and futsal. This compares to 11% specifically set aside for men's competitions and 10% set aside for youth football. Between 1991 and 2010, there was no FIFA FUTURO III regional course for women's coaching. A FUTURO III regional course men's coaching workshop was hosted in 2008. In 2007, there was a women's football seminar held in the country. In 2007, there was a FIFA MA course held for women/youth football. Performance Between 1977 and April 2012, Djibouti women's national football team played in only one FIFA sanctioned match. It was played in Nairobi on 26 March 2006, with Kenya women's national football team winning 7‚Äì0, holding a lead of 4‚Äì0 over Djibouti at the half. The women's national team has not competed at the Women's World Cup. They played two non- sanctioned games, one in 2004 and one in 2005. In March 2012, the team was not ranked in the world by FIFA and did not formally exist.

Background and development Football is the second most popular women's sport in the country, behind basketball which is number one. In 2006, there were 100 registered female football players in the country, the first time such numbers were tracked. Opportunities for play are limited as there are only four women's football teams in the country, women's football is not organised at schools, and mixed football is not allowed. The lack of development of the national team on a wider international level is symptomatic of wider problems on the continent, including limited access to education, poverty amongst women in the wider society, and fundamental inequality present in the society (especially present in Muslim-majority religious state countries, Mauritania being one such country) that occasionally allows for female-specific human rights abuses. Early development of the women's game at the time colonial powers brought football to the continent was limited as colonial powers in the region tended to take make concepts of patriarchy and women's participation in sport with them to local cultures that had similar concepts already embedded in them. Continent wide, if quality female football players do develop, they leave for greater opportunities abroad. Future, success for women's football in Africa is dependent on improved facilities and access by women to these facilities.

This siphons off potential players from football. A women's football programme was organised in the country in 2000. In 2006, there were 1,065 registered female football players, 340 adults players and 725 youth players. This was an increase from 2000 when there were 800 registered female players, and the 210 total registered players in 2002. In 2006, there were 91 women only football clubs in the country. Women's football was gaining popularity during the late 2000s. By 2009, the total number of women's clubs was 22 senior teams and 38 youth teams. Futsal is played by women in the country, with 80 unregistered female futsal players playing in 2006. In 2015 and 2016 the team played several matches, of which four were FIFA recognized. Two of those were 4‚Äì0 wins against Comoros.http://www.sobikamada.com/sport/item/10921-match-amical-f%C3%A9minin- madagascar-4-0-comores.html The other games were in the Indian Ocean Games. History In 1985, almost no country in the world had a women's national football team, including Madagascar, who did not play in a single FIFA sanctioned match between 1950 and June 2012. In 2005, Zambia was supposed to host a regional COSAFA Women's Championship, with ten teams agreeing to send teams including South Africa, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Malawi, Seychelles, Mauritius, Madagascar, Zambia, Botswana, Namibia, Lesotho and Swaziland. Madagascar did not record a result from this competition. In 2006, there was a FIFA recognised senior A team that had two training sessions a week though they had not played a single game between 2000 and 2006. A FIFA recognised senior A team existed in 2009. In 2010, the country did not have a team competing in the African Women's Championships during the preliminary rounds. The country did not have a team competing at the 2011 All Africa Games. In June 2012, the team was not ranked in the world by FIFA.

The development of women's football in the country and in Africa as a whole faces a number of challenges, with a programme for women's football not being created in the country until 1997. FIFA gives money to the Mauritius Football Association, 10% of which is aimed at developing football in the country in areas that include women's football, sport medicine and futsal. History In 1985, almost no country in the world had a women's national football team and Mauritius was no exception with a women's football programme only being established in the country in 1997.

Another problem with the development for the national team, one faced throughout the continent, is if quality female football players are found, many leave the country seeking greater opportunity in Northern Europe or the United States. Women's football was formally established in Mauritius in 1997. As of 2009, there was no national or regional women's competition but a school competition existed. There are 17 clubs for women over the age of 16 and four youth clubs in the country. The country has three national women's football teams: senior, under-15, and under-19. In the period between 2002 and 2006, none of them played even one international match. 10% of the money from the FIFA Financial Assistance Programme (FAP) is targeted at the technical development of the game, which includes women's football, sport medicine and futsal. This compares to 15% for men's competitions and 4% for youth football development. Between 1991 and 2010 in Mauritius, there was no FIFA FUTURO III regional course for women's coaching, no women's football seminar held in the country and no FIFA MA course held for women/youth football.

There are problems that impact the development of the women's game in Africa that effect Niger. Background and development Early development of the women's game at the time colonial powers brought football to the continent was limited as colonial powers in the region tended to take male concepts of patriarchy and women's participation in sport with them to local cultures that had similar concepts already embedded in them. The lack of later development of the national team on a wider international level symptomatic of all African teams is a result of several factors, including limited access to education, poverty amongst women in the wider society, and fundamental inequality present in the society that occasionally allows for female specific human rights abuses. When quality female football players are developed, they tend to leave for greater opportunities abroad. Continent wide, funding is also an issue, with most development money coming from FIFA, not the national football association.

Attempting to commercialise the game and make it commercially viable is not the solution, as demonstrated by the current existence of many youth and women's football camps held throughout the continent. The Nigerien Football Federation was founded in 1967 and became a FIFA affiliate that same year. The FIFA trigramme is NIG.

They are in a region that faces many challenges for the development of women's sport. Football is the most popular women's sport in the country and teams do exist for women to play on though they are few. Participation rates dropped by a large number in 2006. The sport's governing body in the country is not providing much support for the game and faces its own challenges. National team In 1985, almost no country in the world had a women's national football team, including Somalia who did not have a FIFA recognised senior or youth team by 2006 and who have never played in a FIFA sanctioned game. The country has not sent a team to compete in major regional championships including the 2010 African Women's Championships during the preliminary rounds or the 2011 All Africa Games. In March 2012, the team was not ranked in the world by FIFA and did not formally exist. Background and development Women's football in Africa in general faces several challenges, including limited access to education, poverty amongst women in the wider society, and fundamental inequality present in the society that occasionally allows for female specific human rights abuses. At the same time, if quality female players in Africa are developed, many, including Somalis, leave their home countries to seek greater football opportunities in places like Northern Europe or the United States. Funding for women's football in Africa is also an issue: Most of the funding for women's football and for the women's national teams comes from FIFA, not the national football association, which in this case is Somali Football Federation who have not established a women's football programme in the country. Future success for women's football in Africa is dependent on improved facilities and access by women to these facilities. Attempting to commercialise the game is not the solution, as demonstrated by the many youth and women's football camps held on the continent leading to improvements in player skill and increased interest in the sport. Football is the most popular women's sport in the country. In schools, girls and boys do not play mixed football in Somalia. On the adult level, there are 450 teams, 8 of which are available to women to play as mixed gendered teams and 6 which are women only. In 2000, there were 280 registered female players on the junior and senior levels. This data was not kept from 2001 to 2004. In 2005, there were 1,435 registered female players but in 2006, the number dropped dramatically to 220. This can be contrasted to futsal where there were 175 registered female footballers and 440 unregistered footballers in 2006. In 2005, football was seen as a way to potentially help rebuild the country, with the concept having support from Somali women living abroad. Women from Djibouti have been working to help Somali play football. Muslim extremists inside the country have made it difficult for women to play because of restrictions on what women can do. Inside Somalia, women have been completely prohibited from playing any sport. Rights to broadcast the 2011 Women's World Cup in the country were bought by Al Jazeera, despite the government having banned people from watching the men's competition in 2006 which resulted in several deaths. Somali women would like to play football outside the country in places like Melbourne, Australia but cultural and religious norms they have kept from their home country prevent them from doing so. At the same time that women do not play, they are involved with football organisation by taking their children to participate in games and volunteering to work for local clubs where their children are participating in. Somali Football Federation was founded in 1951 and became a FIFA affiliate in 1962. Between 1991 and 2010 in Somalia, there was no FIFA FUTURO III regional course for women's coaching, no women's football seminar held in the country and no FIFA MA course held for women/youth football. The national federation has six full-time staffers dedicated to supporting women's football, and women's football has representation on the federation's committee. In April 2012, the national football association suffered a setback when its president Said Mohamed Nur was killed in a suicide attack that also killed the president of the country's Olympic Organising Committee.

History Sierra Leone women's national football team is nicknamed the Sierra Queens. In 1985, almost no country in the world had a women's national football team, including Sierra Leone who did not play their first matches until around 1994 when they participated in the qualification phase of the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup. In a game in Nigeria on 6 November 1994, Sierra Leone women's national football team lost 0‚Äì9 to Nigeria after being down 0‚Äì6 at the half. In a game in Freetown on 20 November 1994, Sierra Leone women's national football team lost 0‚Äì2 to Nigeria after being down 0‚Äì2 at the half. These two games represent half of all games the team has played in its history. The team's other two games took place during the preliminary rounds of the 2010 Women's Championship tournament in Africa, which was part of the Olympic qualification process, where Sierra Leone lost during the preliminary round once 2‚Äì3 to Guinea in Conakry on 7 March 2010 and tied Guinea 1‚Äì1 in Freetown on 20 March 2010. Following this match, the team did not play an international match on any level for at least a year and did not participate 2011 All Africa Games. In March 2012, Sierra Leone was ranked the 135th best in the world and the 26th best in Africa. They improved their ranking to 130th best in the world in June 2012 but at still at the bottom of the world rankings alongside 46 other women's national teams. The team's best ever rank was 128th, which was in 2010, and their worst ever ranking was 136, which they were ranked in 2011. =Under-17 national team= Sierra Leone has a Sierra Leone women's national under-17 football team. They were supposed to compete in the African Women U-17 Championship Qualifying Tournament 2010. Togo won the first round because Sierra Leone withdrew from the competition. They competed in the CAF qualifiers for the FIFA U-17 World Cup that will be held in Azerbaijan in September 2012. They did not advance out of their region. The team was supposed to play the Gambia women's national under-17 football team in a qualifying match for the 2012 U-17 Qualifying Tournament. Sierra Leone lost the first leg in Banjul, Gambia 0‚Äì3. The return match was delayed for 24 hours. The team's head coach attributed the loss to poor refereeing. The game against Gambia was the country's first junior national international match. The second match was one by Sierra Leone 3‚Äì1. Gambia won the first match in 3‚Äì0 in a game played in Banjul. The return match was delayed in for 24 hours and played in Makeni. Gambia beat Sierra Leone to qualify for the final round with an aggregate score of 4‚Äì3. The team is coached by Hannah Williams, while Tamba Moses was the assistant coach. Squad members included Cecilia Bangura, Jarriatu Kamara, Hannah Conteh, Haja Kamara, Magret Sesay, Sarah Bangura, Fatmata Turay, Fatmata Mansaray, Kaju Max- Macauley, Aminata Lebbe, Zainab Sesay, Alice Bundor, Adama Sesay, Rashidatu Kamara, Isata Kamara, Wuyiah Muwaid, Nasu Bundor, and Assanatu Jalloh. The cost of travel for the team was paid for by LEOCEM, the country's only cement company. The company's managing director rationalised the decision to pay saying, \\"We received the request from the SLFA at a very short notice but we decided to help because we want to see female football grow from the grass- roots level and also to meet our corporate social responsibility. We are happy about helping out the female team and we hope they'll eliminate their Gambian counterpart.\\" Members of the under-17 team are drawn from the Airtel Rising Stars tournament. =Under-20 national team= Sierra Leone has a Sierra Leone women's national under-20 football team. They competed in the 2010/2011 FIFA U-20 CAF Women's World Cup qualifying competition. They did not advance to the U20 Women's World Cup. They competed in the preliminary rounds of the 2010 CAF FIFA U20 World Cup. In the preliminary round, they did not have to play as Guiena withdrew from the tournament. In the first round, they were supposed to play Nigeria but withdrew from the tournament. They were supposed to compete in the 2010 African Women U-20 Championship Qualifying competition meeting Togo in the first round, but Togo earned a walk over win against Sierra Leone. Sierra Leone eventually withdrew from the competition. The announcement was made a week after the under-17 lost 0‚Äì3 to Gambia. Background and development Early development of the women's game at the time colonial powers brought football to Sierra Leone and the continent was limited, as colonial powers in the region tended to take concepts of patriarchy and women's participation in sport with them to local cultures that already had similar concepts already embedded in them. Other factors on the continent impact the development of the game, including limited access to education, poverty among women in the wider society, and fundamental inequality present in the society that occasionally allows for female specific human rights abuses. When quality players are developed in Africa, they often leave for greater opportunities elsewhere Continent wide; most of the funding for women's football in a country and for the women's national team comes from FIFA, not the national football association. Future success for women's football in Africa is dependent on improved facilities and access by women to these facilities. Attempting to commercialise the game is not the solution, as demonstrated by the existence of many youth and women's football camps held on the continent that have resulted in improved national team performance as players progressed through the system. The United Nations ranked Sierra Leone 180 out of 187 on their Human Development Index. One of the major factors in this low world ranking was gender inequality. Despite a civil war in the country, football remained important to many young people, regardless of gender, in the country. The reason was that football was seen as one way of understanding life by watching what happened on the pitch. In 2007, a football administrator from the country is in charge of the women's football committee in the West African Football Union. In 2011, Brazilian women's football superstar Marta visited the country and met with the national team. Her visit was part of the United Nations Development Programme where Marta is a Goodwill Ambassador. In 2011, there was no national women's league in the country. In 2012, Girls Football League was launched by the Craig Bellamy Foundation after a pilot programme in 2010/2012 in Makeni that included four teams. Girls participating in the programme are given scholarships to attend, with 93% attending school regularly while involved with the programme, a much higher percentage than the national average for female school attendance. Women are football spectators, watching live games in rural and remote areas of the country. Rights to broadcast the 2011 Women's World Cup in the country were bought by the African Union of Broadcasting and Supersport International. The popularity of the sport is declining in the country for women.

It played its first competitive match in 2006. No FIFA recognised senior national team has played a single FIFA- recognised game. Background In 1985, few countries in the world had a women's national football team, including Sudan. A FIFA recognised Sudanese national team for women has never participated in a major regional and international event. , the team has not played a single FIFA sanctioned game. The country has never entered the Women's World Cup, competed in the 2010 African Women's Championships, or participated in the 2011 All-Africa Games. As of March 2012, no team from the country appears on FIFA's worldwide ranking, and a national team did not officially exist. Sudan is one of the only two Muslim countries in the region to have a women's league. According to M√•rtensson and Bailey in Fundamentalism in the Modern World Vol 2: Fundamentalism and Communication: Culture, Media and the Public Sphere, the fact that Sudan has a women's league could be critical for the development of a national women's team. An informal national team called \\"The Challenge\\" has been created inside the league. This team refuses to wear the hijab or wear Muslim clothing while playing and is based in Khartoum. The unofficial national team is not recognised by, nor receives support, from the Sudan Football Association. In 2006, the team played its first competitive match. It was captained by Sara Edward and played against a team from Sudan University that wore traditional garb. The quality of play was not high, and the game ended in a 2‚Äì0 win for the Challenge team. Women's football in Africa in general faces many challenges, including limited access to education, poverty amongst women in the wider society, and fundamental inequality that occasionally allows for female specific human rights abuses. At the same time, if quality female players in Africa are developed, many leave their home countries to seek greater football opportunities in places such as Northern Europe or the United States. Funding for women's football in Africa is also an issue; most of the funding for women's football and for the women's national teams comes from FIFA, not the national football association. The women's national team continues to lack FIFA recognition. The development of a national team faces several challenges common to much of Africa, along with Sudan-specific issues such as religion. Inside Sudan, religion is an issue for making the game popular. Most footballers wanting to play are required to wear the hijab and play while fully covered. While football was organised in the country with 440 men's clubs in 2006, and the first ever women's game being played in the country that year in February between Tahadi and Sudan University at Sports‚Äô City, Sudan University, development was hindered because a fatwa (religious order) by the Fiqh Council of Islamic in 2006 condemned the creation of a women's league in Sudan. Still, in the mainly Christian Southern part of Sudan in 2006, the local government was indicating their support of women's football. By 2009, women's football programmes had been established in the Sudan. That year, there were ten senior women's teams, a school-based competition and a regional competition established. Young girls informally play the game also in refugee camps in the Darfur region. Rights to broadcast the 2011 Women's World Cup in the country were bought by Al Jazeera. In 2012, the Islamic Fiqh Council in Sudan issued another fatwa saying that it is forbidden for the country to create a women's soccer team, deeming it an immoral act, in response to a question from FIFA regarding the feasibility of creating a team. The fatwa suggested that football is a men's sport and women should not participate in it, because it challenges the differences between men and women. The Sudan Football Association, which was founded in 1946, and FIFA affiliated in 1948, was one of the founding members of Confederation of African Football, and continues to be a member of the Confederation. In November 2011, a female association member, Laila Khalid, attended a meeting in South Africa where women's football was discussed, specifically mentioning the problems faced in growing the game in Africa. In October 2019, a women's league was finally established, with Wala'a Essam al-Boushi being the Sudanese Minister of Youth and Sport, following the Sudanese Revolution, during which president Omar al-Bashir was overthrown. The 2019 prize-winning documentary Khartoum Offside by Sudanese film maker Marwa Zein tells the story of the current female football team in Khartoum.

Founded in 1988, the team has limited recognition as the regional governing body, the Zanzibar Football Association, is a full member of the Council for East and Central Africa Football Associations (CECAFA) and Confederation of African Football (CAF), but Zanzibar Football Association is not recognised by F√©d√©ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) as an independent national association. The national team was supposed to have its first international matches in the CECAFA Women's Challenge Cup in October 2007, but the event was cancelled. The team plays domestically against men's sides in Zanzibar. The development of women's football in Zanzibar faces several challenges specific to Africa and their own islands, including efforts to politicize the game. Background and development of women's football Zanzibar is a territory consisting of two main islands, Unguja/Zanzibar and Pemba, and is a semi-autonomous part of Tanzania with its own government. As of the 2002 census, it had a total population of 984,625. Women's football in Africa has not developed compared to elsewhere because of a variety of factors, including limited access to education, poverty amongst women in the wider society, and fundamental inequality present in the society that occasionally allows for female specific human rights abuses. Another problem with the development of the game throughout the continent is that higher ability players leave to play in Europe or the United States. According to Kuhn, funding for the game on a regional level is problematic as national associations do not fund the women's game adequately. Zanzibar has unique problems relating to the development of the women's game including pressures for female players to wear the hijab while playing and pressure from male family members not to participate as their involvement may bring shame to the family. There is minimal support for the game at schools, with the national federation not responding to requests from the national team coach to work harder to get girls to play the sport in school. A national women's league was created in 2004 after a 26-year effort. Five teams competed in the inaugural season: Women Fighters, Nyuki FC, Koani Sisters, Bungi Sisters and Policewomen FC. Women Fighters won the first two editions of the league, however, the league has since collapsed. Team Founded in 1988 by Nassra Juma Mohammed of Tanzania, the Women Fighters was Zanzibar's first women's football club, upon which the national team was built, and the team was created at a time when there were very few women's national teams in existence. Prior to 1988, women had played informally or on men's only teams; several of these players, as well as those from other sports, including badminton, made up the inaugural team. The team soon played a game against the touring Swedish women's club side, Tyres√∂ FF in Zanzibar's largest football stadium, losing the game 0‚Äì15 at Amaan Stadium. At the time the team was created, there were few opportunities for it to compete against other women's teams in Zanzibar, but they have played and sometimes beaten men's teams in Zanzibar while receiving support from the Zanzibar Football Association and Zanzibar's Ministry of Sport. The players do not wear a hijab or cover up as part of their kit, which has led to criticism from religious leaders for playing in public while wearing shorts and jersey tops, instead of covering their bodies according to Muslim custom. The team trains in Stone Town at the Mao Tse Tung Stadium. Player recruitment and retention has been a problem because some members of the national team have been prohibited from playing by their husbands or family members. Male relatives of the Fighters team have beaten players because they \\"disgrace them\\". National team players are eligible to play for Tanzania in all competitions. Aziza Mwadini and Sabai Yusuf are two Zanzibar based players who have participated in a Tanzanian national team training camp. , Mohammed remained the team's head coach. The national association, founded in 1926, is recognised by the Council for East and Central Africa Football Associations (CECAFA), but not by F√©d√©ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) despite repeated attempts for such recognition. However, it became a member of CAF in 2017, after previously being an associate member, and plans to re-apply for FIFA membership, which it last did unsuccessfully in 2005. Zanzibar were meant to play in the inaugural CECAFA Women's Challenge Cup in October 2007, but the tournament was ultimately cancelled because of an inability to attain funding from CECAFA to cover costs connected to the competition. The competition was to have been jointly funded by CAF and CECAFA. The CECAFA secretary, Nicholas Musonye said of the event, \\"CAF wants to develop women football in this region in recognition of the milestones CECAFA has achieved over the years. CAF appreciates what CECAFA has done despite the hardships the association has gone through, from financial problems to political instability in member states and poor management of associations. Member states in the CECAFA region have not taken women's football seriously. CAF now wants to sponsor a long-term campaign to attract women from this region into the game.\\" CECAFA, after many false starts, eventually staged the first ever CECAFA Women's Championship in 2016 in Uganda, and Zanzibar were one of seven participating teams. They lost all 3 group games, scoring just 1 goal and conceding 30. In 2007, a movie was made about the team called Zanzibar Soccer Queens. The film was featured at the BFI London Film Festival in 2007.

However, in recent years there have been national teams formed in various age groups, and the sport is gaining popularity.  History  Women's football officially began in the country in 1998, and faced a number of structural, population and geographic hurdles. Starting in 2003, LFV organized a girls' football tournament as part of their schools tournament. Participation increased for several years, with girls eligible to play on school teams with boys at the F, E and D junior levels. In 2007, some of the teams including girls that competed in the tournament included \\"Herzensbrecherinnen\\", \\"Die wilden Sieger\\", \\"Die wilden M√§dchen\\", \\"Dia guata Sch√§llab√§rgerinna\\", \\"Sheep to sheep\\", \\"Hip-Hop Girls\\" and \\"Ice Girls\\". In 2008, LFV created \\"M√§dchen am Ball\\", a project designed to encourage girls to take up the sport. One of the outcomes of the program was the creation of junior girls teams affiliated with football clubs in the country including FC Schaan, USV Eschen/Mauren and FC Ruggell. This program was still active in 2011, with LFV holding a pair of introductory training courses for girls in grades 2 to 5 in May of that year. This followed several events for girls earlier in the year to encourage them to take up a sport traditionally associated with boys. These courses were seen as part of a step towards creating a youth player base that would assist in the creation of a women's national team that could compete in the UEFA Women's Championship and the FIFA Women's World Cup. That year, a women's football program was held during Sarganser Sport Week. It was organized by Monika Zuppiger, LFV's Youth Talent Coordinator. In 2010, FC Triesen held a training day for junior and senior women's players, with the goal of encouraging them to get more involved in the sport and get in the practice of playing every Saturday. In 2012, the program saw FC Triesenberg become the first junior girls team to participate in an LFV sponsored tournament. Representatives from the country participated in a 2014 study group called \\"Women¬¥s football in Iceland\\" as visitors. Their delegation was headed by Monika Burgmeier, along with top level women's club coaches Stefan Negele, Anton Kindle and Walter Vogt. Burgmeier presented a session called, \\"Women‚Äôs football in Liechtenstein\\". The following year, the Liechtenstein Football Association formally created a program to work towards the development of women's football in the country. According to the Liechtenstein Football Association, this began to bear fruit in 2017. In September 2017, as part of a program with FIFA, kits, safety equipment and training materials were provided to 200 girls in the country to encourage their participation in the sport.  Popularity and participation  Volleyball was the most popular women's sport in the country, with football ranking as the 6th or 7th most popular. By 2017, football had supplanted volleyball as the most popular women's sport. In 2006, there were 165 registered female players in the country. This represented growth from 72 players in 2000. Less than 3% of the national federation's budget is earmarked for women's football, compared to 9% for men and 17% for youth. There were 283 registered female players in 2016, with a decline in 2017 to 259 registered players. 61 of these players in 2017 were 18+, while 198 were youth players. The ratio of male to female coaches was 89:11 in 2017. 4 of these women coaches were UEFA B licence holders while another 4 were National C licence holders. There was one qualified female referee in the country in 2017, and she only worked women's games. Girls played football in mixed groups as part of their organized school curriculum.  Club football  The first women's club side in the country was FC Ruggell, who were founded in 1987 and played in the first division of the Meisterschaftsbetrieb des Ostschweizer Fussballverbandes (OFV) in eastern Switzerland. The team continued to play in that division for a number of years. For the 2003‚Äì04 season, they merged with FC Bad Ragaz and in 2007 they were known as FC Ruggell-Liechtenstein. They play at the highest level from 2003‚Äì04 on before being relegated for the 2006‚Äì07 season to the NLB. The team qualified for the 2003 and 2008 Swiss Cup, making it to the quarterfinals both years. In 2003‚Äì04 and 2004‚Äì05, they qualified for the semi-finals of the Swiss Cup. In 2008, the team disbanded for financial reasons. The second club to form was FC Vaduz, which was created in 1990. The women's club existed for only a year and a half before it was dissolved. The third club to be created was FC Triesen. It was founded in 1996. When FC Ruggel dissolved in 2008, it left FC Triesen as the only senior women's club side in the country. In 2012, FC Sulz was created. This was the first women's football club created in the country that was not affiliated with a men's club. The organization was created to promote the development of women's football in Vorarlberg. Playing in Switzerland is the norm for most women's clubs in the country as a result of the size of their population and its location. Liechtenstein women's clubs that have played in Switzerland based leagues include FC Ruggell and Triesen/Balzers. Women from Liechtenstein have also played for clubs in Switzerland. In 2017, three women from the country played for FC St. Gallen / Staad including Katja Beck, Sophia H√ºrlimann and Lena G√∂ppel. Liechtenstein women also play in a domestic league. The league is supported by the Liechtenstein Football Association. It had 4 teams in 2017. The league was not professional, with all the players being domestic ones. Average attendance at league matches was 30 people in 2017. = FC Triesen = FC Triesen is one of the football clubs in the country that has been working on developing female players on the grassroots level. They have several women's and girls teams affiliated with them, including a women's side playing in Switzerland. This team has players from several countries including Colombia, Switzerland, Turkey, the Netherlands and Italy. There is also a second level women's team called FC Balzers / FC Triesen. National teams Liechtenstein did not have a national team by 2006 on either the senior or youth level. The women's national team did not play in any FIFA-sanctioned matches until early 2020. In 2013, President of the Liechtenstein Football Association (LFV) Matthias Voigt said he was committed towards working on the creation of a women's national team, and pointed to the activity level in the women's domestic competition. Despite this comment, the federation had no staff dedicated to women's football as of 2017 and also did not have a women's football committee. Inclusion of women in governance was also limited, with only one woman serving on a committee and only 5 women serving in managerial positions within the organization. Progress on the development front as a result of activities by the LFV were part of the reason that Radio Liechtenstein cited as why in September 2017, it was the time to create a senior women's national team. U-16 and U-18 girls' national teams have been in existence by 2017. UEFA listed the senior national women's side as a U-19 B team. = Senior team = The LFV took the initial steps in building the national women's team for the first time in January 2020, starting with a training camp where older players were called up from clubs in Austria or Switzerland, joining their under-19 compatriots. Liechtenstein will make their senior debut in international women's football with a friendly against Gibraltar in Ruggell at a later date, originally set for 28 June. They played their first matches, both unofficial, against Grasshopper Club Z√ºrich Frauen U17s and FC B√ºhler on 12 and 26 January. = National U-16 team = The women's national U-16 team was formally created by the LFV in 2014.

The team's first coach was 29-year-old Tanja Herrmann, and the roster included 30 players. Herrman, a former player in the top women's league in the country, chose Monica Burgmeier to serve as her assistant coach. She had a UEFA B+ coaching license. They were the first women's national football team on any level for the country. Players were first called up to the national side in October and November 2014. Some of the earliest players named to the squad included 7 players from FC Schaan.

Their victory against Macedonia was the first time a Liechtenstein women's national football team had ever won an international match across all age levels. They were coached in the tournament by Selina Ruckstuhl. = National U-19 team = FIFA, UEFA and LFV committed to working on the development of women's football in the country, including the creation of youth women's national teams as part of efforts to create a senior national team. Among other things, this resulted in girls and women players jerseys, shin guards and shoes so all players would have access to the same level of equipment and consistency of materials across the local women's football ecosystem. These materials were distributed at a ceremony in September 2017. Following this ceremony at Sportplatz Blumenau in Triesen, the national U-19 team played their first game in their history against East Switzerland women's U-19 club side St.Gallen-Goldach. The U-19 team lost 4‚Äì3. They had led 0‚Äì2 going into the end of the first half. The team played a friendly in October 2017 against Luxembourg which they drew 3‚Äì3.

So once I started progressing in my playing, I looked for heavier bands like Megadeth and Testament.

There was something about his playing that just pulled me in,\\" remembers Dreyer. Jake released four EPs and an album before graduating high school.

But Bali was insistent that he cannot stop Dhaanam to a young Brahmachari Brahmin. Sukracharya then changed his form to that of a bee and went into the nozzle of the kamandalu, blocking water flow. Lord Vamana on seeing this, pricked the nozzle with a blade of darbha grass, which blinded Sukracharya. Sukracharya meditated upon Shiva at this place in Mylapore and got his eyesight back.  The Temple  The Temple is a fairly mid-sized Temple with a five-tier vimana facing south. On entering the Temple, the first deity we see is that of Lord Ganesha in standing posture with his consorts Siddhi and Buddhi. This posture of Ganesha is said to be rare. We come next to the Shrine of Lord Velleeswara in the form of a Linga facing East. The next shrine that we see is that of Goddess Kamakshi. The Goddess faces south. We can view the idols of the Saptamathrikas installed as we circumambulate Lord Shiva's Shrine. Goddess Varahi is much venerated here. We also come across an Idol of Lord Vishnu in TriVikrama posture behind Lord Shiva's Shrine, and Devi Durga (facing north), and as we proceed further we come to the Shrine of Lord Kartikeya sanctified here as Lord Muthukumaraswamy. The deities of the Lord can be seen along with his consorts Valli and Devasena in standing posture. We then proceed to the outer courtyard after crossing the Idol of Lord Bhairava and immediately on the left we can see the shrines for Lord Sarabeshwara, a small shrine for Goddess Pratyangira Devi and Sukracharya praying to Lord Shiva. Also in the outer courtyard we find shrines of Lord Shaneeswara and the Navagrahas. The Flagstaff is installed in the outer courtyard.  Mythology  Vellee means Sukra, and Velleeswara is Lord of Sukracharya. Sri Sukracharya worshipped the Lord here and got back the eyesight he lost at the hands of Lord Vamana. You can see the statue form of Sri Sukra worshipping the Lord here in this temple. There are many who say that unless they are able to see God with their own eyes, they can't believe in the Divine. How can such arrogance \\"see\\" God when it takes aeons for a serious devotee to \\"see\\" God, ask the Siddhas. Yes, God can be \\"seen\\", they assure us, but first one has to get the right spiritual training. In the process of this training, one's eyes will be empowered with that spiritual vision that can perceive God. It is this eyesight that Sri Velleeswarar can bless us with. Furthermore, the eyes are the windows of the soul. In this Kali Yuga, our eyes look at all kinds of scenes and become the entry points for all kinds of desires. It is Sri Velleeswarar who can protect us from falling prey to the desires inflamed by our eyes. It is He who can also give us the blessing that our eyes see only which is good for us. In the material world, Sri Velleeswara is the divine eye doctor who can solve eye related diseases and problems. The Siddhas instruct all eye doctors to offer worship at this shrine.

The film stars Macy Wu as a girl named Future who has to re-populate the human race after radiation attacks from the Xucker race have made 99% of men on Earth infertile in the year 2046. The film was released in Hong Kong on 6 October 2011 and was shown at Far East Film Festival in Udine. The film has received negative reviews. Plot A young woman named Future (Macy Wu) is sent from the year 2046 to the year 2011 in Hong Kong. Future was sent by the United Nations in order to get pregnant, so she can then extract the genes and repopulate the Earth, as 99% of males have become infertile in the future due to attacks from Planet Xucker. Two assassins from Xucker (Taka Kato and Ya-wen Hseh) are sent after her to stop her. The assassins can turn people into sex zombies. Some of her friends got turned into zombies and they were turned against her. Future meets three university students: Felix (Justin Cheung), Dan-san (Andrew Kwok) and Sing (Tsui Ho-cheong). The men are obsessed with female students next door: Chin- chin (Akiho Yoshizawa), Chen-chen (Monna Lam and Sai-sai (Chen Chih-ying). The students agree to help Future find a mate at the university. Production The film has an international cast with Chinese actress Macy Wu as Future, Taiwanese male lead of Chen Chun-yan as the lead role of Long and two Japanese AV idols (Akiho Yoshizawa as Chin-chin and Akiho and Taka Kato as a Xucker male assassin. Despite the film title, it is not a 3D film. Chinese model Macy Wu stated she took on the role of Future as she felt director Cash Chin \\"filmed women in a beautiful way\\". Wu reportedly beat model Mavis Pan to the role. Style The 33D Invader's director Cash Chin is known for creating Category III sexploitation films in Hong Kong such as Sex & Zen II (1996) and the sequels to the film Crazy Love. Derek Elley of Film Business Asia described the style of The 33D Invader as \\"a harmless, silly-arse Cantonese youth comedy with lots of nudity and a couple of gross-out visual gags\\". A review in Twitch Film described the first half of the film as \\"a typical eighties student sex comedy, \\"Porky's\\" style\\" and that the science fiction \\"girl-from-the-future plot only kicks in when the film reaches its halfway point.\\" Release The film was released theatrically in Hong Kong on 6 October 2011. The film was screened at the 14th Udine Far East Festival in Italy in 2012. The film grossed a total of $302,387 in Hong Kong where it peaked at the fourth highest-grossing film in the region on its second week of release. A blu-ray disc of the film was released in Region A by Kam & Ronson. The disc contains Cantonese and Mandarin languages and English subtitles. Reception Film Business Asia gave the film a rating of three out of ten, calling it a \\"Lame softcore sex comedy\\" and that the best thing about the film apart from the lead of Macy Wu was \\"the title\\". A review from Twitch Film opined that it was \\"a pretty terrible film\\" but stated that the character's (portrayed by Akiho Yoshizawa and Chen Chih Ying) \\"willingness...to disrobe at the slightest provocation, and occasionally even to cause provocation, makes the film a not all-together arduous experience.\\" Notes External links * Category:Hong Kong films Category:2010s science fiction comedy films Category:Hong Kong science fiction films Category:Hong Kong sex comedy films Category:Films set in 2046 Category:2011 comedy films ","title":"The 33D Invader"},{"id":"35479171","text":"Dao is a surname in Canada, India, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Singapore, Scotland, UKhttps://www.ancestry.com.au/name- origin?surname=daohttp://www.indiachildnames.com/originoffamilyname.aspx?surname=dao Persons with the surname * ƒê√†o Cam M·ªôc, imperial official involved in overthrow of the Early L√™ dynasty and the installation of L√Ω Th√°i T·ªï * ƒê√†o ƒê√¨nh Luy·ªán, a former Chief of Staff in the Vietnam People's Army * ƒê√†o Duy T·ª´, a 17th-century poet * ƒê√†o VƒÉn Phong, a soccer player * Julie C.

The plot involves a group of adventurers seeking to free the land of Xorinth from the curse laid upon it by the evil Prince Dragor. Battles take place in real-time (as opposed to turn-based combat) with a set amount of experience points awarded for each monster slain. Additional experience can also be gained by solving the various puzzles scattered throughout the game.

Aldrich was the Associate Curator of Insects at the United States National Museum. He is considered one of the most prolific entomologists in the study of flies. Biography John Merton Aldrich was born in Rochester, Minnesota on January 28, 1866. When he was fifteen, he moved with his family to a farm in South Dakota. He enrolled at South Dakota State University and graduated in 1888, one year early because the university president wanted to have a graduating class that year.* He studied entomology briefly under Otto Lugger at the University of Minnesota and then started working at the South Dakota State Agricultural Experiment Station with the understanding that he would continue to study entomology in the winter. In 1889 he enrolled at Michigan State University and studied with entomologist Albert J. Cook. Cook suggested that he focus his studies on a single order of insects; Aldrich followed his advice and focused his career on Diptera (flies). In 1891, Aldrich was awarded an M.S. from South Dakota State University. In 1892, Aldrich traveled to the University of Kansas where he was befriended by Samuel W. Williston who lent him money and encouraged him to stay at his house. The University awarded Aldrich a second M.S. and in 1893 he left Kansas to become the first zoology professor at the University of Idaho. In Idaho he worked on economic entomology while maintaining a focus on flies. He began to assemble his most important work, Catalogue of the North American Diptera, published by the Smithsonian in 1905. His catalog described 8.300 flies and was considered a landmark study of Diptera in America. In 1893, he married Ellen J. Roe from Brookings, South Dakota, but after only four years of marriage, his wife and their infant son died. In 1905 he remarried to Dell Smith of Moscow, Idaho. In 1906, Alderich took a sabbatical to attend Stanford University where he submitted his Catalogue as a doctoral thesis and was awarded a Ph.D. in 1907. When he returned to Idaho he found that a fire had destroyed the university. Fortunately for Aldrich, he had stored his personal library and insect collections off-campus. Aldrich continued to work at the University of Idaho for another six years. In 1913 he became embroiled in the politics of academia and was terminated along with four other professors for accusing the university president of incompetence. One biographer later called the dismissal \\"an outrageous and unwarranted interference.\\" Aldrich had a national reputation as a talented entomologist and he was quickly hired into the USDA Bureau of Entomology and stationed in Lafayette, Indiana. There he spent the next five years studying the agricultural pests of cultivated grains. He also wrote an important monograph on the Sarcophaga and Allies in North America (1916). After the death of Frederick Knab in 1918, Aldrich became the Associate Curator of Insects and the Custodian of Diptera at the United States National Museum in Washington, D.C., a position he held until his death Throughout his career, Aldrich was a prolific collector of insects and was known for his ability to find rare species. He collected widely in the western United States, Alaska, Canada, Europe and Guatemala. Many his specimens were new to science. His expertise made the National Museum a center for studies on New World Diptera. In 1928, Aldrich presented his collection of more than 45,000 specimens and more than 4,000 named species to the museum. He also donated to the museum a card catalog file of North American literature on these specimens. His collection is one of the most important general Diptera collections in the National Museum. Later life Aldrich was active in the All Souls Unitarian-Universalist Church in Washington, D.C., where he taught religion classes. He co-founded the Thomas Say Foundation. He served as curator and custodian at the United States National Museum until his death in 1934. His archival collections are held in the Smithsonian Institution Archives. He died suddenly on May 27, 1934. He was buried in Moscow, Idaho. Works *Aldrich, John M. and Carl Robert Osten-Sacken. A catalogue of North American Diptera (or two-winged flies).

To recast an error, an interlocutor will repeat the error back to the learner in a corrected form. Recasts are used both by teachers in formal educational settings, and by interlocutors in naturalistic language acquisition.  Child language acquisition  Recasts can be used by adults to improve children's native language skills. A frequently used technique is for the adult to imitate the child's speech. In this form of recast, the adult repeats the child's incorrect phrases in correct form. This enables the child to learn the correct pronunciation, grammar and sentence structure.  Language education  Recasts can be used for teaching second languages. Sometimes, the teacher will repeat the words back to the student, usually with different intonation or form, or as a question, so that the recasting appears as a continuation of the conversation: For example, in German: * Student: \\"Ich m√∂chte haben ein Stift. * Teacher: \\"Du m√∂chtest einen Stift haben?\\" Here, the teacher has corrected the student's incorrect positioning of the infinitive \\"haben\\" and their declension of the indefinite article \\"ein\\". In this form the recast is usually more than a simple repeating of the learner's words. The teacher will correct the student's errors but also extend the learning by adding additional words or phrases. A further example, in English: * Student: \\"I want eat.\\" * Teacher: \\"What do you want to eat?\\" In this example the teacher is making the correction to the student's speech (adding a \\"to\\") but also extending the learning by asking a question.  Efficacy  Some researchers into second language learning have challenged the degree of effectiveness of recasts drawing attention to the abilities of the learner and the limitations imposed by the learner only being able to repeat the words of the teacher as factors that have not been accounted for by proponents of the method.

It is a tributary of the Vaal River and belongs to the Upper Vaal Water Management Area. Course The Mooi rises near Koster and flows southwards. During its course it flows into the Klerkskraal Dam, Boskop Dam and the Potchefstroom Dam. After crossing the town of Potchefstroom it bends southwestwards, shortly bending westwards before it empties into the Vaal River near the border with the Free State, about 15 km east of Stilfontein.Upper Vaal WMA 8 Its main tributaries are the Wonderfonteinspruit (Mooirivierloop) and the Loop Spruit. The waters of the Mooi River and its reservoirs are polluted with heavy metalsHeavy metals (Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn) in mudfish and sediments from three hard- water dams in the Mooi River catchment in its mid and lower course because of the large gold and uranium mining operations in the basin.Radioactivity Monitoring Programme - Mooi River catchment History In November 1838 Voortrekker leader Andries Hendrik Potgieter and his followers established the first permanent European settlement north of the Vaal by the banks of the Mooi River, founding the town of Potchefstroom. The city was named in Potgieter's honor and was the capital of the former South African Republic until May 1860, when the capital moved to Pretoria.About Potchefstroom - History The river and its main tributary the Wonderfonteinspruit were named by early settlers and owe their names to the abundance of karst springs that were found along their banks. Most popular ones include Klerkskraal eyes (still active) Bovenste Oog (still active), Oog van Gerhard Minnebron (still active), Boskop eye (status unknown), Turffontein eyes (still active), Oog van Wonderfonteinspruit (dry), Oberholzer Oog (dry), Bank eyes (dry) and Venterspos eye (dry). Of these springs only Klerkskraal eye (which comprises one permanent spring and several perennial springs), Bovenste Oog and Oog van Gerhard Minnebron still flow. The status of Boskop eye is unknown as the area was flooded when Boskop dam was built making it very difficult to locate and observe. The dry springs were a result of dewatering the aquifers that fed the eyes to make way for gold mining in the Far West Rand.  Tributaries  There are 3 primary tributaries all joining from the east they are Wonderfonteinspruit, Loopspruit and Rooikraalspruit. There are several perennial streams and drainage canals along the banks. Notable rivers and streams in the Mooi Rivers watershed include Wonderfonteinspruit, Loopspruit, Rooikraalspruit, Enselspruit, Taaiboschspruit, Leeuspruit, Tweeloopiespruit, Mooirivierloop and Spekspruit.  Fauna  = Fish = Fish species found in the river include Small mouth Yellowfish (Labeobarbus aeneus), Orange River Mudfish (Labeo capensis), Moggel (Labeo umbratus), Sharptooth Catfish (Clarias gariepinus), Banded Tilapia (tilapia sparrmanii), Southern Mouthbrooder (pseudocrenilabrus philander), Three spot Barb (enteromius trimaculatus), Chubbyhead Barb (enteromius anoplus), Straight-fin Barb (enteromius paludinosus), Western Mosquitofish (Gumbisa affinis), Common Carp (cyprinus carpio), Largemouth Bass (micropterus dolomieu), Swordtail (Xiphophorus hellerii), Smallmouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides), Grass Carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), Rock Catfish (Austroglanis sclateri), Canary Kurper (Chetia flaviventris). No known sightings of the Largemouth Yellowfish (Labeobarbus kimberleyensis) have been recorded in the last 40 years in the upper and middle Mooi River or its tributaries but there's a strong possibility that they do occur in the river close to its mouth on the Vaal river. Mozambique Tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus), Redbreast Tilapia (Tilapia rendalli), Blue (Israeli) Tilapia (Oreochromis aureus) and Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) occur in the Wonderfonteinspruit up to where it disappears into the ground, but there are no known samples from the Mooi River itself. = Birds = The river and its surroundings harbour a rich bird population of over 250 recorded species including African Fish Eagle, Martial Eagle, Ostrich, Secretarybird, Greater and Lesser Flamingo, Grey Hornbill, Meyers Parrot, Kori Bustard, Giant Eagle Owl to name a few.

His nicknames in the underworld were \\"Swiss Watch,\\" due to the methodical way in which he plotted his robberies, and \\"Saint John,\\" due to his patience. Plymouth Mail Robbery Kelley was linked to the 1962 Plymouth Mail Robbery. Boston mobster Vincent Teresa served as a lieutenant to mob family boss Raymond Patriarca; he claimed in his book My Life in the Mafia that Kelley was the man who planned the robbery. Kelley came under intense scrutiny and pressure from postal inspectors and other federal authorities towards the expiration of the five- year statute of limitations. Newsweek magazine quoted him as saying that the postal inspectors \\"had harassed my wife and frightened my Siamese cats.\\" Kelley was arrested and tried for the robbery. He was represented by attorney F. Lee Bailey, who won an acquittal. 1968 Boston Brinks holdup Kelley allegedly was involved in the planning of the robbery of a Brinks armored car in Boston on December 28, 1968 that netted approximately $500,000 in cash and a similar amount in checks. Kelley had intended to be part of the gang that robbed the armored car, but had backed out after two previous attempts failed. He demanded and did receive a cut of the proceeds and eventually was questioned by a grand jury. His confederates believed that he gave them up to the federal prosecutors. Once again, he was represented by Bailey. Patriarca Family murder trial Kelley testified against Patriarca family boss Raymond Patriarca in a murder case, after which he went into the Federal Witness Protection Program. Kelley gave testimony linking Patriarca and other family members to the murder of Rudolph \\"Rudy\\" Marfeo and Anthony Melei. Kelley had been contracted by Patriarca associate Maurice Lerner to kill Marfeo and Melei, whom Kelley allegedly murdered with a shotgun. Patriarca and his associates were convicted of conspiracy to commit murder while Lerner also was convicted of murder; the mob boss was sentenced to 10 years in prison.

One audience member at the club yelled out \\"Too soon!\\", which has since become a common response to jokes told in the immediate wake of tragedies. Gottfried then improvised and performed \\"The Aristocrats\\" routine, which released a great deal of tension and got rousing applause from the crowd.Holt, Jim (August 27, 2011). The Encyclopedia of 9/11: Humor , New York (magazine) In contrast to these early jokes about 9/11, late-night comedy shows and humorous publications did not appear for several weeks following the attacks. The Onion, a satirical newspaper, cancelled the issue that had been scheduled to be released on September 11, 2001, and then returned to print with a special edition on September 26, 2001, which was devoted to the attacks. When the issue was released, the newspaper staff felt trepidation over making humor of such a tragic event. \\"Everyone thought this would be our last issue in print,\\" according to one staff writer. Despite this expectation, The Onion staff was quickly inundated with comments from readers, the vast majority of which were positive. However, they self-censored the article titled \\"America Stronger Than Ever, Say Quadragon Officials.\\" One of the first 9/11 jokes made by a major American comedian in the UK was one told by Joan Rivers in London in 2002. The joke concerned the widows of fire fighters killed in the attacks, who Rivers said would be disappointed if their husbands had been found alive as they would be forced to return money they had received in compensation for their late spouses. The joke received condemnation from Harold Schaitberger, General President of the International Association of Fire Fighters. In literature \\"The Zero\\" (2006) by Jess Walter is a post-9/11 satirical novel which features a New York City cop who shoots himself in the head and forgets it minutes later; his brain damage accounts for gaps in the story.Maslin, Janet (September 11, 2006). \\"New York Times: \\"After the Cataclysm, a Surreal Drift of Failing Senses\\" https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/11/books/11masl.html?_r=0 The postmodern novel \\"United States of Banana\\" (2011) by Latin American author Giannina Braschi treats the entropic scenes of disaster on September 11 with black humor; the work describes New York City without the Twin Towers as a mouth unwilling to laugh because it is missing its two front teeth. In 2016, comedian Billy Domineau uploaded a spec script to the Internet that he had written for Seinfeld, which had aired its last episode in 1998, set in New York during the days after the attacks. He said later that it had started when he suggested \\"a 9/11 episode of Seinfeld\\" to a student as an example of \\"an exercise in bad taste\\" for a class. In his episode, the show's four main characters follow plotlines typical of them, all related to the attacks: Jerry becomes convinced that dust from the fallen towers is contaminating his food; Elaine, initially relieved that she won't have to break up with a boyfriend who worked at the Twin Towers, finds herself engaged to him when he unexpectedly survives; George basks in the glory after he is mistaken for a hero who rescued people, and Kramer attempts to recover the high-quality box cutter he loaned to Mohammed Atta. Popular minor characters, such as George's parents and Newman, also make appearances. \\"[It] is indeed in bad taste, but it perfectly captures the self-obsessed way these characters would handle such a crisis,\\" wrote The Guardian. In animation In the Family Guy episode \\"Back to the Pilot\\", broadcast in November 2011, Brian and Stewie take a trip back in time during which Brian tips off his past self about 9/11 so that the old him can play hero and stop the terrorist attacks. This causes George W. Bush not to be re-elected, meaning a Second Civil War starts that leads to nuclear attacks on the Eastern Seaboard. Brian and Stewie are then forced to go back and mend the situation, later noting that their celebratory cheers of causing 9/11 to happen again would sound really bad if taken out of context. A Time critic wrote of the episode, \\"It sounds custom-made for a 'too soon' label, and it probably is. But avid Family Guy viewers live for 'too soon' moments, no matter how sensitive the material.\\" Other news organizations, including Aly Semigran of Entertainment Weekly, also thought the show had gone too far with the reference. Deadline also commented that it \\"squeaked past the Fox standards and practices department but is sure to raise as many eyebrows.\\" However, perhaps reflecting how the acceptability to mainstream broadcasters of jokes referencing the 9/11 attacks has evolved only gradually, the DVD release of the earlier season five Family Guy episode \\"Meet the Quagmires\\", first broadcast in 2007, contained an extended scene which was removed from the episode as first broadcast. In the deleted scene, while traveling in time back to 1980s Quahog with Peter, Brian is confronted by the boyfriend of a woman he has been hitting on. In response to the boyfriend's challenge that he will fight Brian 'anywhere, any time', Brian invites the man to meet him \\"On top of the World Trade Center, September 11th 2001 at 8am\\", to which the boyfriend replies \\"I will be there, pal. You think I'll forget, but I won't!\\".imdb.com , Family Guy: Meet the Quagmires (2007), Quotes. Retrieved July 17, 2013 Additionally, the season seven episode \\"Baby Not on Board\\" features a scene in which the Griffin family visits Ground Zero, which Peter erroneously believes is \\"where the first guy got AIDS\\". The season six episode \\"Back to the Woods\\" had Peter committing identity theft against a fictionalized James Woods, in retaliation of him doing the same and ruining his life. Peter appears on the Late Show with David Letterman proving he is Woods, promoting a comedy film based on the attacks. To improve the chance of an Oscar award, a 9/11 joke was cut from Jean Dujardin's 2012 comedy film The Players. The deleted scene featured a man seducing a woman in a New York apartment while an aircraft crashes into the World Trade Center in the background. In The Simpsons episode \\"Moonshine River\\", aired in 2012, Bart tells his father he would desire New York now that his two least favorite buildings have been obliterated, but then quickly adds Old Penn Station and Shea Stadium, after a pause. In advertising In the days before the 15th anniversary of the attacks in 2016, Miracle Mattress of San Antonio, Texas, briefly ran a commercial promoting a sale themed around the occasion. In it the daughter of the store's owner, in conversation with two employees who stood behind her, explained how the store was recalling the Twin Towers' collapse by selling all its inventory at the price of twin-sized mattresses for the weekend with the slogan \\"Twin Towers, Twin Price\\". At the end of the ad, she inadvertently pushed the two employees into twin piles of mattresses behind her, one of which was topped with the American flag; both collapsed. After briefly expressing shock and horror, she turned to the camera and said \\"We'll never forget\\". The company soon pulled the ad, but copies were saved and uploaded to the Internet, where it and Miracle became the subject of intense and vociferous criticism. Entertainment Weekly said it \\"might be most offensive commercial ever\\". The Miracle Mattress Yelp! and Facebook pages filled with disparaging comments and calls for boycotts. Owner Mike Bonnano, whose daughter had, as the chain's head of marketing, conceived the commercial and starred in it, apologized profusely but eventually decided to close the San Antonio location \\"indefinitely\\" pending disciplinary measures and donations to the 9/11 Foundation. Miracle Mattress reopened a few days later. Online Memes have become a common way of distributing jokes about 9/11. A lot of these memes play with or make fun of 9/11 conspiracy theories such as \\"Bush did 9/11\\" or \\"jet fuel can't melt steel beams.\\" There have also been viral videos on Vine and other platforms that joke about fictional characters or other famous people doing the attacks. In these videos, the creators have a clip of them, or something they throw, or perhaps an aircraft they fly, and then cut to footage of the planes hitting the Twin Towers (mostly Flight 175 hitting the South Tower). This makes fun of that character or real person, saying \\"(blank) did 9/11\\".

Duke Hui died in the ninth month of 637 BC, and Prince Yu ascended the throne, to be known as Duke Huai of Jin.

Hockett in characterizing human language and distinguishing it from animal communication. It describes the way vocal signals can be used to produce language. The speaker uses a vocal tract (containing most of the speech organs) to produce speech sounds, and the hearer employs an auditory apparatus (the sense of hearing) to receive and process the speech sounds. This is why human language is said to be based on speech sounds produced by the articulatory system and received through the auditory system. The vocal channel is a particularly excellent means through which speech sounds can be accompanied or substituted by gestures, facial expressions, body movement, and way of dressing. However, Hockett considers this design feature one which is fundamentally advantageous for primates as \\"it leaves much of the body free for other activites that can be carried on at the same time.\\"  See also  * Animal communication *Hockett's design features  Sources  * *Fatima SADIQI and Moha ENNAJI.(1992).

It runs in a north‚Äìsouth direction from U.S. Highway 80 (US 80) in Monroe to the junction of US 165, US 425, LA 2, and LA 593 in Bastrop. The route is one of two connecting Monroe and Bastrop, the seats of Ouachita Parish and Morehouse Parish, respectively. It runs parallel to US 165 and traverses the eastern suburbs of Monroe, skirting the east bank of Bayou DeSiard. North of Swartz, LA 139 travels through rural surroundings until reaching Bastrop, where it serves as the main north‚Äìsouth thoroughfare on the south side of town. LA 139 was designated in the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering from a portion of former State Route 14. It also served as the original alignment of US 165 from 1926 until its re-routing in 1937. As originally designated, LA 139 continued north from Bastrop to the Arkansas state line along the pre-1955 State Route 204. In 1989, this portion was transferred to the newly created US 425, shortening the route of LA 139 by almost . Route description From the south, LA 139 begins at a junction with US 80, continuing the route of DeSiard Street outside of the Monroe city limits. LA 139 heads northeast on Old Bastrop Road as an undivided four-lane highway with a center turning lane through the Lakeshore suburb situated along Bayou DeSiard. After a short distance, the local name changes to Lincoln Road until reaching an area known as Frizzell Spur, where the center lane is discontinued. LA 139 continues northeast through Swartz as the suburban development becomes more sparse and intersects LA 594\\\\. Here, the highway narrows to two lanes, and the surroundings become increasingly rural. later, LA 139 curves northward and begins a concurrency with LA 134, which connects with Oak Ridge to the east. After less than , LA 134 departs to the west toward Fairbanks, and LA 139 crosses Little Bayou Boeuf from Ouachita Parish into Morehouse Parish. In Morehouse Parish, LA 139 becomes known as Old Monroe Road and intersects LA 554 (Perryville Road), connecting with the nearby small communities of Collinston and Perryville. later, LA 139 enters the Bastrop city limits at Naff Avenue and continues onto South Washington Street. Widening again to an undivided, four-lane highway, LA 139 intersects LA 593 (Collinston Road), and the two highways proceed into town concurrently. Soon after crossing underneath the Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi Railroad (ALM) line, LA 139/LA 539 transitions onto the one-way couplet of South Franklin Street (northbound) and South Washington Street (southbound) in the downtown area, effectively becoming a divided four-lane highway. Over the next three blocks, the highway passes the Morehouse Parish jail and sheriff's office complexes before reaching the city's courthouse square. This marks the northern terminus of LA 139 and consists of a junction with the concurrent US 165/LA 2, which passes through town on the one-way couplet of Jefferson Avenue (eastbound) and Madison Avenue (westbound). Additionally, US 425 follows US 165/LA 2 eastward from the courthouse square and continues the route of LA 139 northward, briefly maintaining the concurrency with LA 593\\\\. The various routes intersecting in the center of Bastrop connect to such nearby communities as Mer Rouge, Oak Ridge, and Sterlington. =Route classification and data= LA 139 is classified by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD) as an urban minor arterial from Monroe to Swartz and within Bastrop. The middle portion of the route is classified as a rural major collector. Daily traffic volume in 2013 peaked at 18,100 vehicles in the suburbs northeast of Monroe and 10,900 vehicles in Bastrop. The rural portions of the route averaged between 3,100 and 4,800 vehicles daily. The posted speed limit is generally in rural areas, reduced to between Monroe and Swartz and to in Bastrop. History In the original Louisiana Highway system in use between 1921 and 1955, LA 139 was part of State Route 14. Five years after its designation, Route 14 was chosen as the alignment of US 165 between Alexandria and the Arkansas state line when the U.S. Highway system was implemented in 1926. Route 14 remained entirely co-signed with US 165 until the latter was moved onto a newer alignment between Monroe and Bastrop in 1937. When the Louisiana Department of Highways renumbered the state highway system in 1955, unnecessary concurrencies between state and U.S. highways were eliminated. Only the portion of Route 14 no longer concurrent with US 165 retained a separate state designation, as LA 139. With the 1955 renumbering, the state highway department initially categorized all routes into three classes: \\"A\\" (primary), \\"B\\" (secondary), and \\"C\\" (farm-to-market). This system has since been updated and replaced by a more specific functional classification system. As the original route description indicates, LA 139 once extended northward from Bastrop to the Arkansas state line en route to Hamburg. This alignment made up the entirety of pre-1955 State Route 204 and was part of LA 139 from the 1955 renumbering until being transferred to the newly designated US 425 in 1989. This shortened the designation of LA 139 by almost .

History  = Live At The Wind And The Willows (1979) = Early in their career in the late 1970s, Riders In The Sky (then consisting of Ranger Doug, Too Slim, Tumbleweed Tommy Goldsmith, and Woody Paul) would regularly perform live at The Wind And The Willows club in Nashville on Tuesday nights. Deciding to make the performances more interactive and parody and pay homage to 1930's era Western singing cowboy serials, Tommy Goldsmith wrote a story called The Cowboy Who Hated Christmas to be performed live in front of the audience at The Wind And The Willows. This would become the first \\"episode\\" of Riders Radio Theater, except these performances were never taped. Some other Riders Radio stories performed at the club were \\"The Riders Join OPEC\\", \\"The Riders Go Hawaiian\\", \\"The Riders Go To Sweden\\", and \\"The Triple X Chainsaw Massacre\\". Goldsmith would later say that he was inspired to write The Cowboy Who Hated Christmas by a radio program called Radio Mystery Theater that he would listen to while on the road touring as a musician. = The Album (1988) = In 1988, the Riders, now a trio, would record the album titled Riders Radio Theater for their second MCA record. This hour-long album would essentially become a prototype episode of the actual half-hour radio series. = The National Public Radio Series (1988-1995) = The early half-hour shows included (in order): an opening song by the Riders, a fake commercial, another song, a chapter in the \\"Ongoing Saga of the Cowboy Way\\", another song, and then close with \\"So Long, Saddle Pals\\". In later episodes, guest stars (The Nashville Jugband being the first) would perform where the second song was and then later in the middle of the \\"Ongoing Saga of The Cowboy Way\\" chapter. Also some later episodes would run out of time, completely omitting the closing performance of \\"So Long, Saddle Pals\\". The first two episodes were taped on April 25, 1988. The first 52 episodes (from 1988 to 1989) were taped in Nashville, then from January 22, 1990 to August 18, 1995, the show was taped at the Emery Theater in Cincinnati, Ohio. = The Nashville Network Television Specials (1995-1996) = Several Riders Radio Theater television specials were commissioned by the Riders' then manager David Skepner for The Nashville Network shortly after the radio series had ended, the first special featuring Barbara Mandrell. = Silver Jubilee Medley (2003) = On the Riders' 2003 album, Silver Jubilee, a new, six-minute mini-episode of Riders Radio Theater was recorded for the Riders' 25th Anniversary. = Live From The Golden Age of Riders Radio Theater Album (2006) = In 2006, the Riders released a \\"best of\\" collections of songs from the first couple of serials called Live From The Golden Age of Riders Radio Theater.

The accident took place at 1.13 PM killing four and injuring fifty more instantly. Reacting to the incident, Railway Ministry spokesman Anil Saxena told the press that \\"While four of the coaches got tilted, three of them derailed. So the coaches which are affected are the 11th onwards from the engine, up to the 17th coach\\". The region, where accident took place, does not have good road connectivity. Relief and rescue teams had to rush to the spot from Varanasi and Lucknow. On the possible cause for the accident, Railway Board member AP Mishra said that exact cause has to be ascertained. It could have been \\"due to excessive heat causing track expansion or some miscreant activity,\\" he said, adding that the railway track could be cleared by the next morning. The train was heading towards Varanasi at the time of its derailment. Overview =Crash= On the evening after the crash, more detailed reports from various news agencies suggested that at least seven persons were killed and 24 others were injured in the accident. Reports said that the death and injury toll from the mishap could rise. According to the officials in Jaunpur district administration, seven coaches, which included seven sleepers and two general, had derailed. The officials said that the driver of the Doon Express had seen some distortion in the railway track and as a result, applied the brakes. Ten coaches along with the engine safely passed through the damaged track. However, seven coaches at the rear got derailed. The place where the accident took place is 35 km from Jaunpur railway station and 70 km from Varanasi. Officers of the district administration along with ambulances and medical care reached the spot in half an hour. Senior officials including the divisional railway manager from Lucknow also rushed to the spot. The railways dispatched three relief trains from Lucknow, Faizabad and Varanasi to the accident site in order to rescue stranded passengers and take them to either Lucknow or Varanasi. While around 200 passengers were rescued by the local villagers before arrival of the officials, over 500 were said to be still trapped in the damaged coaches. =Probing= Reacting to the incident, Union Railway Minister Mukul Roy has said that sabotage cannot be ruled out of the list of probabilities. Earlier, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee also demanded a probe into the incident pointing that it happened on a day when a nationwide bandh had been enforced by NDA and Left parties. \\"Since the accident has taken place during a country-wide bandh we want this to be probed. Who has caused this mishap? It has to be seen whether this is truly an accident or an incident,\\" said Ms Banerjee who was Railways Minister herself till she was elected chief minister in 2011. Railways Minister Mukul Roy left for the accident site while he ordered a high-level probe into the accident. \\"I have ordered a high-level inquiry to find out why such repeated accidents are happening. We will take serious steps to prevent such accidents,\\" he said. The minister also announced compensation of Rs.5 lakh for the families of each of those killed; Rs. 1 lakh for those injured and Rs. 25,000 for those who have sustained minor injuries. Eyewitnesses and villagers, who reached the accident site, said a loud sound was heard after the derailment, suggesting that the train was in high speed when the accident occurred. Of the five sleeper coaches that tilted, two were derailed. While villagers reached the site immediately after the accident to begin rescue operation, the district administration and railways could start the operation only after an hour. Recovery Prima facie ruling out that the derailment of Doon Express was the handiwork of anti-social elements, the Railway Minister, Mr Mukul Roy, that night, said an inquiry into the incident would be conducted by the Commissioner of Railway Safety and stern action would be taken against the guilty. Mr Roy visited the district hospital in the wee hours and inquired about the well-being of the passengers injured in the accident. He said that expenses for the treatment of those seriously injured would be borne by the Railway Ministry. Finally, on 2 June, the movement of trains between Lucknow and Varanasi has been restored. More than 20 trains were either diverted, short-terminated or cancelled for two days, after the route got blocked due to derailment.

They are led by different chief deities in different documents and are divided into a number of different groups‚Äîincluding black (terrifying) and white (benevolent), and eastern and western. While there generally seem to be 99 tngri, some documents propose three others (from the north), and while they are generally the highest divinities, some liturgical texts propose an additional group of 33 chief gods alongside the tngri. They were invoked only by the highest shamans and leaders for special occasions; they continue to be venerated especially in black shamanism. Chief among the tngri are Qormusata Tngri and (Khan) M√∂ngke Tngri. The term tngri is cognate with the Turkic theonym tengri \\"sky\\", Mongolian ta≈ã…£ara…£ \\"oath\\". Sergei Starostin, StarLing database: \\"Proto-Altaic: *t\`a≈ãgiri \\"oath, god\\" (–∫–ª—è—Ç–≤–∞, –±–æ–∂–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ) \\"An interesting common Altaic religious / juridical term. The proposed etymology presumes that the meaning 'sky' in Turkic is secondary ( < 'God'); if it is not the case, one could accept S. Georg's thesis about a loan in Turkic < Yenisseian *t…®≈ãgVr- 'high' (see Georg 2001) - although we must admit that other loans from Yenisseian are unknown to us.\\" Mongolian pantheon In Mongolian shamanism, tngri constitute the highest class; they are attested already in the oldest written source in Mongolian, The Secret History of the Mongols. The highest deity, Tngri, is the \\"supreme god of heaven\\" and is derived from Tengri, the primary chief deity in the religion of the early Turkic and Mongolic peoples, and also goes by M√∂ngke Tngri (\\"Eternal Heaven\\") or Erket√º Tngri (\\"Mighty Heaven\\"); he rules the 99 tngri as K√∂ke M√∂ngke Tngri (\\"Blue Eternal Heaven\\"). Associated with him is another chief deity, Qormusata Tngri, described by one scholar as the more active being and compared to the Hindu god of heaven Indra. In addition to the 99 tngri, there are also \\"seventy-seven levels of Mother Earth\\" and 33 other gods; the latter, like the tngri, are ruled by Qormusata Tngri. =Origin of the tngri= Some of the tngri are self-created, a special status, though in later texts some of those tngri were said to have been created by Buddha, a possible influence of Buddhism on Mongolian folk religion. One of those self-created is Khan M√∂ngke Tngri, who created Yesu Hei (the father of Genghis Khan) and the Mother of Fire. The tngri and their divisions Klaus Hesse described the complex spiritual hierarchy in clan-based Mongolian society based on sources that go back to the 13th century. The highest group in the pantheon consisted of 99 tngri (55 of them benevolent or \\"white\\" and 44 terrifying or \\"black\\"), 77 natigai or \\"earth-mothers\\", besides others. The tngri were called upon only by leaders and great shamans and were common to all the clans. Black tngri were invoked only by black shamans \\"against evil from outside and for securing victory in war\\". To complicate matters, there is a further division among the 99 tngri: 44 are from the \\"eastern side\\", 55 from the \\"western side\\", and there are three more, from the \\"northern side\\", making a total of 102. And among the eastern and western group, there is a division in how the tngri are supplicated: in both group, the greatest multiple of 10 (40 in the east, 50 in the west) are invoked through prayer, the rest (4 in the east, 5 in the west) through sacrifice. Walther Heissig lists a large number of further divisions‚Äîthe tngri are made up of groups including the gods of the four corners, five wind gods, five gods of the entrance and five of the door, five of the horizontal, et cetera. He notes that scholars have found a complete enumeration and description of the 99 to be impossible, and that a full list of names mentioned adds up to more than 99, and that local differences occur due to different local gods being accepted and that later sources indicate the further acceptance of Buddhist deities among the tngri. A group of nine supreme tngri occurs regularly, but they are not always the same though Qormusata Tngri and M√∂ngke Tngri are always included among the \\"Nine Great Tingri\\". Function The tngri function primarily as protectors. BaŒ≥atur Tngri, for instance, is a protector of heroes in warfare, KisaŒ≥a Tngri (an equestrian deity, known as Red Kisant Tngri among the Buryati) protects riches and the souls of people, and AtaŒ≥a Tngri is the protector of horses. Many of the functions of the tngri are specifically related to the Mongolian way of existence, especially the herding of cattle; different tngri have very specialized functions pertaining to specific animals and aspects of their raising. There are also tngri invoked for hunting and the growing of fruits and grains.

However, it was later discovered that the target was a compound that the United States had asked to collect weapons for the government of Hamid Karzai, and that the dead and captured were all backers of the American invasion.Stephen Tanner, \\"Afghanistan: A Military History\\"BBC News, 24 January 2002, US troops battle Al Qa'ida militants Battle The 101st Airborne was reportedly \\"spoiling for a fight\\", when they were given the opportunity to launch an overnight helicopter-borne assault against a school, which they characterized as \\"two adjacent compounds\\" in Hazar Qadam, 60 miles north of Kandahar. The United States found 400 60mm mortar rounds, 300 RPG rounds, 300 100mm rockets, thousands of fuses, 250 automatic grenade launcher rounds and more than 500,000 individual rounds for small arms, that had been collected by their Afghan allies, and called in an AC-130 gunship to destroy the cache. The resulting firefight at the weapons depot killed 21 Afghans, and 27 others were captured and taken to Camp Rhino as prisoners. Journalist Mark Mazzetti put the body count at over 40. One American was wounded in the ankle, making him the first American military casualty since Nathan Chapman was the first soldier killed. Aftermath Governor Gul Agha Sherzai demanded information on why his officials, on the American side of the invasion, were being held as detainees. Early reports said that it was an al-Qaeda compound, while General Richard Myers reported that American troops had attacked a \\"Taliban headquarters\\", and other officials said that the captives likely included both Taliban and al-Qaeda members. Over time, the US government qualified that it was likely not al-Qaeda and \\"mostly of a Taliban nature\\" or \\"Afghan fighters\\". However, Afghans protested, and journalists later revealed that the depot had been collecting arms under American orders, and the captured \\"fighters\\" were local leaders on the Americans' side, including the district police officer. The Governor of Kandahar, Gul Agha Sherzai, issued a statement noting that the structure had been collecting weapons as part of a weapons amnesty program organized by the United States, and that the Afghan casualties included the district police chief, his deputy and members of the district council, each of them loyal to the American-backed Hamid Karzai government. Eventually, the United States conceded that the attack was an instance of friendly fire, and released the prisoners on February 6. The prisoners reported that they had been beaten and abused in US custody. On February 5, Karzai noted that the attack was \\"a mistake of sorts\\", while Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld later said that the battlefield situation had been \\"untidy\\" and the US had acted on \\"persuasive and compelling\\" intelligence. When it was revealed that a number of the dead had their hands tied behind their backs, the United States defended its actions, stating that it was common for troops to bind the hands of wounded enemies in a fight - and that some must have mistakenly bound the hands of already-dead Afghan villagers as well.

History Tudor Hall was founded in 1850 by the Rev. T.W. Todd and his wife (Mrs. Todd) in Salisbury, then moved to the London area around 1865. By the 1900s, the school had expanded and was in need of more space. In 1908, it moved to Chislehurst in Kent. The school went through difficult times and had to be closed down for a term in 1935. Former pupil Nesta Inglis, elder daughter of banker and Marylebone Cricket Club amateur cricketer Alfred Inglis, took over as headmistress and re-opened the school. At the outbreak of the Second World War, the school was moved to Burnt Norton, near Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire, to escape the air raids. However, the school outgrew the property during the war. Miss Inglis came across some land outside Banbury, Oxfordshire, and the purchase was made in February 1944. The school then made its final move in January 1946 to its current location.Tudor Hall Boarding Tudor Hall offers a full boarding programme. Over two thirds of pupils are boarders.

Nudging contrasts with other ways to achieve compliance, such as education, legislation or enforcement. The nudge concept was popularized in the 2008 book Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness, by two American scholars at the University of Chicago: behavioral economist Richard Thaler and legal scholar Cass Sunstein. It has influenced British and American politicians. Several nudge units exist around the world at the national level (UK, Germany, Japan and others) as well as at the international level (e.g. World Bank, UN, and the European Commission). It is disputed whether \\"nudge theory\\" is a recent novel development in behavioral economics or merely a new term for one of many methods for influencing behavior, investigated in the science of behavior analysis. Definition of a nudge Example of a nudge: a housefly painted onto the ceramic of a urinal in a men's public toilet The first formulation of the term and associated principles was developed in cybernetics by James Wilk before 1995 and described by Brunel University academic D. J. Stewart as \\"the art of the nudge\\" (sometimes referred to as micronudges). It also drew on methodological influences from clinical psychotherapy tracing back to Gregory Bateson, including contributions from Milton Erickson, Watzlawick, Weakland and Fisch, and Bill O'Hanlon. In this variant, the nudge is a microtargetted design geared towards a specific group of people, irrespective of the scale of intended intervention. In 2008, Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein's book Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness brought nudge theory to prominence. It also gained a following among US and UK politicians, in the private sector and in public health.See: Dr. Jennifer Lunt and Malcolm Staves The authors refer to influencing behaviour without coercion as libertarian paternalism and the influencers as choice architects. Thaler and Sunstein defined their concept as: In this form, drawing on behavioral economics, the nudge is more generally applied to influence behaviour. One of the most frequently cited examples of a nudge is the etching of the image of a housefly into the men's room urinals at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, which is intended to \\"improve the aim\\". Overview A nudge makes it more likely that an individual will make a particular choice, or behave in a particular way, by altering the environment so that automatic cognitive processes are triggered to favour the desired outcome. An individual‚Äôs behaviour is not always in alignment with their intentions (termed a value-action gap). It is common knowledge that humans are not fully rational beings; that is, people will often do something that is not in their own self-interest, even when they are aware that their actions are not in their best interest. As an example, when hungry, people who diet often underestimate their ability to lose weight, and their intentions to eat healthy can be temporarily weakened until they are satiated. Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman describes two distinct systems for processing information as to why people sometimes act against their own self-interest: System 1 is fast, automatic, and highly susceptible to environmental influences; System 2 processing is slow, reflective, and takes into account explicit goals and intentions. When situations are overly complex or overwhelming for an individual‚Äôs cognitive capacity, or when an individual is faced with time- constraints or other pressures, System 1 processing takes over decision- making. System 1 processing relies on various judgmental heuristics to make decisions, resulting in faster decisions. Unfortunately, this can also lead to sub-optimal decisions. In fact, Thaler and Sunstein trace maladaptive behaviour to situations in which System 1 processing over-rides an individual‚Äôs explicit values and goals. It is well documented that habitual behaviour is resistant to change without a disruption to the environmental cues that trigger that behaviour. Nudging techniques aim to use judgmental heuristics to the advantage of the party creating the set of choices. In other words, a nudge alters the environment so that when heuristic, or System 1, decision-making is used, the resulting choice will be the most positive or desired outcome. An example of such a nudge is switching the placement of junk food in a store, so that fruit and other healthy options are located next to the cash register, while junk food is relocated to another part of the store. Types of nudges Nudges are small changes in environment that are easy and inexpensive to implement. Several different techniques exist for nudging, including defaults, social proof heuristics, and increasing the salience of the desired option. Nudging to incite pupils to use toilet buildings at May Sa'iri school in Ethiopia A default option is the option an individual automatically receives if he or she does nothing. People are more likely to choose a particular option if it is the default option. For example, Pichert & Katsikopoulos found that a greater number of consumers chose the renewable energy option for electricity when it was offered as the default option. A social proof heuristic refers to the tendency for individuals to look at the behavior of other people to help guide their own behavior. Studies have found some success in using social proof heuristics to nudge individuals to make healthier food choices. When an individual‚Äôs attention is drawn towards a particular option, that option will become more salient to the individual, and he or she will be more likely to choose to that option. As an example, in snack shops at train stations in the Netherlands, consumers purchased more fruit and healthy snack options when they were relocated next to the cash register. Since then, other similar studies have been made regarding the placement of healthier food options close to the checkout counter and the effect on the consuming behavior of the customers and this is now considered an effective and well-accepted nudge. Application of theory Behavioral insights and nudges are currently used in many countries around the world. = Government = In 2008, the United States appointed Sunstein, who helped develop the theory, as administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. Notable applications of nudge theory include the formation of the British Behavioural Insights Team in 2010. It is often called the \\"Nudge Unit\\", at the British Cabinet Office, headed by David Halpern. Both Prime Minister David Cameron and President Barack Obama sought to employ nudge theory to advance domestic policy goals during their terms. In Australia, the government of New South Wales established a Behavioural Insights community of practice. In 2020, the UK government of Boris Johnson decided to rely on nudge theory to fight the coronavirus pandemic. Patrick Vallance, the UK‚Äôs chief scientific adviser, seeks to encourage ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù with this strategy. = Business = Nudge theory has also been applied to business management and corporate culture, such as in relation to health, safety and environment (HSE) and human resources. Regarding its application to HSE, one of the primary goals of nudge is to achieve a \\"zero accident culture\\". Leading Silicon Valley companies are forerunners in applying nudge theory in corporate setting. These companies are using nudges in various forms to increase productivity and happiness of employees. Recently, further companies are gaining interest in using what is called \\"nudge management\\" to improve the productivity of their white-collar workers. = Healthcare = Lately, the nudge theory has also been used in different ways to make health care professionals make more deliberate decisions in numerous areas. For example, nudging has been used as a way to improve hand hygiene among health care workers to decrease the number of healthcare associated infections. It has also been used as a way to make fluid administration a more thought-out decision in intensive care units, with the intention of reducing well known complications of fluid overload. Critique Nudging has also been criticised. Tammy Boyce, from public health foundation The King's Fund, has said: \\"We need to move away from short-term, politically motivated initiatives such as the 'nudging people' idea, which are not based on any good evidence and don't help people make long-term behaviour changes.\\" Likewise, Mols et al (2015) acknowledge nudges may at times be useful, but argue that covert nudges offer limited scope for securing lasting behavior change. Cass Sunstein has responded to critiques at length in his book, The Ethics of Influence: Government in the Age of Behavioral Science (2016) making the case in favor of nudging against charges that nudges diminish autonomy, threaten dignity, violate liberties, or reduce welfare. He further defended nudge theory in his Why Nudge?: The Politics of Libertarian Paternalism (2014) by arguing that choice architecture is inevitable and that some form of paternalism cannot be avoided. Ethicists have debated nudge theory rigorously. These charges have been made by various participants in the debate from Bovens to Goodwin. Wilkinson for example charges nudges for being manipulative, while others such as Yeung (2012) question their scientific credibility. Public opinion on the ethicality of nudges has also been shown to be susceptible to ‚Äúpartisan nudge bias‚Äù. Research from David Tannenbaum, Craig R. Fox, and Todd Rogers (2017) found that adults and policymakers in the United States found behavioral policies to be more ethical when they aligned with their own political leanings. Conversely, people found these same mechanisms to be more unethical when they differed from their politics. The researchers also found that nudges are not inherently partisan: when evaluating behavioral policies absent of political cues, people across the political spectrum were alike in their assessments. Some, such as Hausman and Welch (2010) have inquired whether nudging should be permissible on grounds of (distributive) justice; Lepenies and Malecka (2015) have questioned whether nudges are compatible with the rule of law. Similarly, legal scholars have discussed the role of nudges and the law. Behavioral economists such as Bob Sugden have pointed out that the underlying normative benchmark of nudging is still homo economicus, despite the proponents' claim to the contrary. It has been remarked that nudging is also a euphemism for psychological manipulation as practiced in social engineering. There exists an anticipation and, simultaneously, implicit criticism of the nudge theory in works of Hungarian social psychologists who emphasize the active participation in the nudge of its target (Ferenc Merei, Laszlo Garai). In their book Neuroliberalism: Behavioural Government in the Twenty-First Century (2017) the authors argue that while there is much value and diversity in behavioural approaches to government there are significant ethical issues, including the danger of the neurological sciences being co-opted to the needs of neo-liberal economics.

The mostly single-track and continuously electrified line branches in Waldbronn-Busenbach from the Alb Valley Railway ()‚Äîwith which it is closely linked operationally and historically‚Äîand runs as a branch line to Ittersbach. The Albtal-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft (Alb Valley Transport Company, AVG) is responsible for the railway infrastructure and is the only company operating on the 14.4 kilometre-long line. Originally the Busenbach‚ÄìIttersbach railway was operated together with the Ittersbach to Pforzheim line, which later became the Pforzheim Light Railway (Pforzheimer Kleinbahn). The whole line from Busenbach to Pforzheim was initially built to , later the section from Busenbach to Ittersbach was rebuilt to and the Pforzheim Light Railway was closed. The line has been operated as part of line S 11 of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn since 1994. History The opening of the Alb Valley Railway from Karlsruhe to Busenbach on 14 May 1898 was followed by the opening of the Busenbach‚ÄìIttersbach section on 10 April 1899. These lines were originally metre gauge. The extension to Br√∂tzingen, then a suburb of Pforzheim, followed on 2 January 1900. The line was initially operated with steam locomotives. In 1898, the Busenbach‚ÄìIttersbach and the Alb Valley lines were taken over by the Badische Lokal-Eisenbahnen Aktiengesellschaft (Baden Local Railway Company, BLEAG), a newly formed subsidiary of the Westdeutsche Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft (West German Railway Company, WeEG). In 1911, the line from Busenbach to Ittersbach was electrified with single-phase AC at 8,000 volts 25 Hz (later increased to 8,800 volts). Technical problems and a lack of thermal coal forced the BLEAG in 1917 to abandon electrical service on the branch line from Busenbach and later to remove the overhead wiring. During the Great Depression, the BLEAG came under pressure and therefore it abandoned the unprofitable operations between Busenbach and Ittersbach in early 1931. The remaining section to Pforzheim, however, was sold to the town of Pforzheim, which then operated it as the Pforzheim Light Railway. Only after the take over of the BLEAG by The German Railway Operating Company (Deutsche Eisenbahn- Betriebs-Gesellschaft), DEBG) in 1932 were operations between Busenbach and Ittersbach resumed. The line was electrified again by 1936. On 1 April 1957, the AVG finally took over the line. Unlike the neighbouring Alb Valley Railway, the line to Ittersbach by AVG was not upgraded for full operations, but instead it was temporarily closed down on 14 November 1964. It was not until almost two years later, on 30 June 1966, that the section to Langensteinbach S√ºd was reopened with standard gauge and electrified at 750 Volt DC. The following section to Ittersbach remained closed due to low demand. It was not until the municipality of Karlsbad was founded in 1971 that it was decided to reconstruct the Langensteinbach‚ÄìIttersbach section. This section was reopened on 16 October 1975. The new line left its original route to improve the connection to Spielbergof. So in 1975, operations ended on the Langensteinbach station‚ÄìLangensteinbach S√ºd section, which had been reopened in 1966. The new line also runs closer to the centre in Ittersbach than the route used by the metre gauge line. In 1979, the Busenbach‚ÄìReichenbach section was realigned and shortened. In 2011, a short double track section was also built between Langensteinbach and the newly created station of Schie√üh√ºtten√§cker. Operations Track plan of the line (not to scale) as of 2006 A train of line S 11 near Ittersbach The end of the line at Ittersbach Rathaus The Ittersbach line has been served during the daytime every 30 minutes by line S 11 of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn since 1994. Previously the service on both the line to Bad Herrenalber and to Ittersbach had been called line A. The trains to and from Ittersbach run over the Alb Valley Railway and continue through Karlsruhe and usually end on the Hardt Railway (Hardtbahn). In the peak hour additional express services are run. No freight traffic operates on the line. The platform height at most stations is 38 centimetres. Turning loops at Langensteinbach St. Barbara and Ittersbach Rathaus enable trains to be reversed. The whole line is operated under the regulations for operations applying to non-federally owned railways (Fahrdienstvorschriften Nichtbundeseigenen Eisenbahnen, FV-NE).

The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs of the U.S. Department of State, along with the U.S. exchange community, recognized the importance of youth exchange as a key component of renewed commitment to building bridges between citizens of the U.S. and countries around the world, particularly those with significant Muslim populations. Kennedy-Lugar Youth Exchange and Study Program The Kennedy-Lugar Youth Exchange and Study (YES) Program was established in October 2002. The program provides scholarships for high school students from countries with significant Muslim populations to spend up to one academic year in the United States.Kennedy-Lugar Youth Exchange and Study (YES) Program The first class of YES students arrived in the United States in 2003. The program has continued to expand, and has made connections across more than 40 countries: * Albania * Bahrain * Bangladesh * Bosnia-Herzegovina * Bulgaria * Cameroon * Egypt * Gaza * Ghana * India * Indonesia * Israel (Arab Communities) * Jordan * Kenya * Kosovo * Kuwait * Lebanon * Liberia * Libya * Malaysia * Mali * Morocco * Mozambique * Nigeria * Oman * Pakistan * Philippines * Qatar * Saudi Arabia * Senegal * Sierra Leone * South Africa * Suriname * Tanzania * Thailand * Tunisia * Turkey * West Bank * Yemen Kennedy-Lugar YES Abroad program The Kennedy-Lugar YES Abroad program, sponsored by the U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, was initiated as a reciprocal extension of the YES program with the first group of American high school students and recent graduates participating in the 2009-10 academic year. YES Abroad is focused on cultural exchange and offers full scholarships for one academic year to live and study abroad in selected YES countries. The scholarship covers costs related to round-trip airfare, room and board for necessary pre-departure orientations, support within the host country, cultural enrichment activities, school tuition (where applicable), room and board with a host family, secondary medical benefits, visa fees, and a modest stipend. As of 2018, YES Abroad countries includehttp://www.yes-abroad.org/countries: * Bosnia and Herzegovina * Bulgaria * Ghana * India * Indonesia * Jordan * Macedonia * Malaysia * Morocco * Philippines * Senegal * Thailand * Turkey (not offered this program year) YES Abroad students serve as ‚Äúyouth ambassadors‚Äù of the United States, promoting mutual understanding by forming lasting relationships with their host families and communities. Participants live with a host family, attend a local high school, acquire leadership skills, and engage in activities to learn about the host country‚Äôs society and values; they also help educate others about American society and values. YES Alumni Associations YES students returning from their exchange year in U.S. are welcomed by the alumni communities in their country. These YES alumni communities actually help students to settle back into the culture after having had a whole year of learning, and these YES alumni communities are also responsible for helping returnees to cope with the reverse-culture shocks. Most of the YES alumni communities across the world are involved with volunteering activities that span over educational, cultural and recreational learning. However, these activities are not limited to managing educational projects but also include participation in rehabilitation and social welfare projects. For instance, YES Alumni Pakistan, one of the biggest YES alumni associations in the world, is involved with many of the abovementioned activities all across the year, examples being the rehabilitation project after the 2010 Pakistani floods, the YES Ramadan project in 2013, and numerous other alumni led workshops and seminars. Yes Alumni Albania as well has gotten involved even though one of the smallest ones, they are the first ones to have ever created this volunteers group known as ‚Äúthe YES Volunteers‚Äù that help them during different projects and are not necessarily YES alumni. Many other such projects are also conducted under the banner of YES alumni associations all around the world. These activities are seen as a reflection of the passion for community service that students are exposed to over the course of their year abroad.

He was the only Japanese passenger on the RMS Titanics disastrous maiden voyage. He survived the ship's sinking on 15 April 1912 but found himself condemned and ostracized by the Japanese public, press, and government for his decision to save himself rather than go down with the ship. Hosono's grandson is Haruomi Hosono, leading member of the Japanese band Yellow Magic Orchestra. Early life and career Hosono was born in the village of Hokura, now part of the city of J≈çetsu, in Niigata Prefecture in 1870. In 1896, he graduated from the Tokyo Higher Commercial School (now Hitotsubashi University) and joined the Mitsubishi Joint Stock Company. In 1897, he left the company to work as a cargo clerk at the Shiodome Freight Terminal in Tokyo. In 1906, he completed a Russian language course at the Tokyo Language School (now the Tokyo University of Foreign Studies), and became a manager in the Accounting and Investigating Division of the Imperial Railroad Office the following year. In 1908, he became a railroad director. In 1910, Hosono, working for the Ministry of Transport, was sent to Russia to research the Russian state railway system. His journey back to Japan took him first to London, where he stayed for a short time, then to Southampton where he boarded Titanic on 10 April 1912 as a second class passenger. Voyage Masabumi Hosono's account of the sinking, written on Titanic-headed stationery During the night of 14/15 April he was awakened by a steward. However, he was blocked from going to Titanics boat deck, from which lifeboats were already being launched, as a crewman assumed that he was a third class passenger. He eventually made his way past the obstruction and made his way to the boat deck, where he saw with alarm that emergency flares were being fired: \\"All the while flares signalling emergency were being shot into the air ceaselessly, and hideous blue flashes and noises were simply terrifying. Somehow I could in no way dispel the feeling of utter dread and desolation.\\" Hosono saw four lifeboats being launched and contemplated the prospect of an imminent death. He was \\"deep in desolate thought that I would no more be able to see my beloved wife and children, since there was no alternative for me than to share the same destiny as the Titanic\\". As the number of lifeboats remaining diminished rapidly, \\"I tried to prepare myself for the last moment with no agitation, making up my mind not to leave anything disgraceful as a Japanese subject. But still I found myself looking for and waiting for any possible chance for survival.\\" As he watched lifeboat 10 being loaded, an officer shouted, \\"Room for two more\\", and a man jumped aboard. Hosono saw this and, as he later put it, \\"the example of the first man making a jump led me to take this last chance.\\" He made it aboard safely and later commented: \\"Fortunately the men in charge were taken up with something else and did not pay much attention. Besides, it was dark, and so they would not have seen who was a man and who a woman.\\" From his vantage point in the lifeboat, only away from the sinking ship, he heard the cries of those still aboard and what he described as \\"extraordinary sounds\\", seemingly four distinct explosions, when the ship broke up. He described what he heard and saw as Titanic went under: At about 8 am on 15 April, the lifeboat's passengers were rescued by the RMS Carpathia. Once aboard, Hosono slept in the smoking room but avoided it when he could as he was the target of jokes by the seamen, whom he called \\"a good-for-nothing band of seamen\\" for whom \\"anything I say falls on deaf ears.\\" He pushed back, showing them \\"a bulldog tenacity\\" and eventually gained what he called \\"a bit of respect.\\" He still had in his coat pockets a sheaf of stationery with Titanics letterhead on which he had started writing a letter to his wife in English. During Carpathias voyage to New York, he used the paper to write an account in Japanese of his experiences. It is the only such document known to exist on Titanic stationery. Return to Japan Hosono's story attracted little attention at first. He went to the offices of Mitsui in New York to ask friends for help to get him home. From there he travelled to San Francisco to find a ship back to Japan. A local newspaper heard of his story and dubbed him the \\"Lucky Japanese Boy\\". Back in Tokyo, he was interviewed by a number of magazines and newspapers including the daily Yomiuri Shimbun, which ran a photograph of him with his family. According to a 1997 article released around the time of the blockbuster film Titanic, Hosono soon found himself the target of public condemnation. He was publicly condemned in the United States. He was described as a \\"stowaway\\" aboard lifeboat 10 by Archibald Gracie, who wrote a best-selling account of the disaster, while the seaman in charge of the boat, Able Seaman Edward Buley, told a US Senate inquiry that Hosono and the other man must have disguised themselves as women in order to sneak aboard. This false accusation was not reported in Japan. He lost his job and was condemned as a coward by the Japanese press. The 1997 article claimed that school textbooks described him as an example of how to be dishonourable and he was denounced as immoral by a professor of ethics. A 2007 reinvestigation by And≈ç Kenji, published in Shinch≈ç 45, was unable to find any such textbooks. In any case, he was soon reemployed by the Ministry, as he was too valuable to lose, and continued to work for it until his death in 1939. Western academics who read the 1997 article put forth various explanations why Hosono encountered such a hostile reaction. It has been said that he was seen to have \\"betray[ed] the Samurai spirit of self-sacrifice\\". Another suggestion, from Jon P. Alston and Isao Takei, is that he was seen as having failed to show the expected conformity and was believed to have selfishly pushed aside other passengers to board the lifeboat. As a result, he was subjected to mura hachibu or ostracism. Margaret D. Mehl attributes his ostracism to the perception that he had embarrassed Japan; the \\"women and children first\\" protocol was not part of the Samurai code, but had instead come to Japan via the 1859 book Self Help by Samuel Smiles, which was a huge success in translation and proved enormously influential in introducing Western values to Japan. Mehl comments: \\"Hosono's failure to act as the Anglo-Saxon nations evidently expected their men to act caused embarrassment in Japan, but more because of the Japanese‚Äôs acceptance of Western values than because of their own traditions.\\" Kenji And≈ç's article concluded that there was nothing unusual about Hosono's treatment, which was sensationalized to fit a 1997 article accompanying the release of a Hollywood film, and it was actually no different than that of Western male survivors such as J. Bruce Ismay. After his death Hosono's story remained a source of shame for his family for decades. He never spoke of it himself, though his letter to his wife was published at least twice, soon after his death and later, in 1980, when an unsuccessful bid was mounted to find the wreck of Titanic. In the late 1990s, the Hosono family released the letter to the media in the wake of James Cameron's hugely successful 1997 film Titanic. Haruomi Hosono, Masabumi's grandson and leading member of the band Yellow Magic Orchestra, declared that he was \\"extremely relieved. Honour has been restored to the Hosonos.\\" As Julian Stringer puts it, the letter \\"enables Haruomi to build a 'bridge' back to his father's emotional life, and so reverse years of social disgrace, through the symbolic properties encrusted in its patina.\\" References Bibliography   * Category:1870 births Category:1939 deaths Category:Japanese civil servants Category:Hitotsubashi University alumni Category:RMS Titanic survivors Category:RMS Titanic's crew and passengers ","title":"Masabumi Hosono"},{"id":"35480607","text":"SCOTS Camanachd is the only shinty team in the British Armed Forces. History It was established in 1994 by Fraser MacKenzie and the club originally played under the name of the Queen's Own Highlanders. They continued as the Highlanders Shinty Club representing the Highlanders (Seaforth, Gordons and Camerons) regiment which in 2006 was amalgamated into the Royal Regiment of Scotland as the 4th Battalion is an infantry battalion of the British Army. The club narrowly lost out in 2003 in South Division 2 to Glasgow University Shinty Club. Due to the 4th Battalion's regular placements abroad, the team at present only plays in cup matches and friendlies. In 2006, the club played the first competitive Shinty game outside Scotland for 80 years, losing to London Camanachd 1-0 in the Bullough Cup, although they won the tie 9-1 on aggregate. They then progressed to the final where they defeated Lochside Rovers 3-1 to win their first ever national trophy of the competition on 23 September 2006, two months after returning from Basra. The club did not enter competition in 2007 or 2008 due to operational reasons and re-emerged under the name, the SCOTS Shinty Club in 2009. The SCOTS is an abbreviation of the Royal Regiment of Scotland. The club re-entered competition in 2009 under its new name and competed in the Sutherland and Bullough Cups once again. The team lost 2-1 to Kinlochshiel in the Sutherland Cup in 2009. The club was hit by tragedy when player Scott Bain died in a tragic accident whilst on leave on 20 July 2009. The club undertook a tour of the Hebrides in 2009. In January 2010, they started marketing themselves to servicemen throughout the British Armed Forces and to veterans. Whilst the club draws many of its players from Shinty playing parts of the Highlands, in particular the 4th Battalion (The Highlanders) but also the 5th Battalion (Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders), the club also look to encourage the sport throughout the British armed forces. With an increasingly wide range of armed forces personnel a rebranding exercise was undertaken and the club renamed SCOTS Camanachd for 2012. Thanks to a deal struck between the Camanachd Association and British Forces Broadcasting Service, the players of the SCOTS had the opportunity to watch the Camanachd Cup Final broadcast live across the World on their bases. Badge from 1994 to 2006. The Scots played the Irish Defence Force Hurling team in the first ever international between the two countries. They were outclassed by a team with many inter-county players but it was a very successful occasion and may be repeated. The Scots also played in several sixes in 2012 including the St. Andrew's Sixes and the first ever London shinty festival, which they won, defeating London Camanachd and Cornwall Shinty Club. The Scots celebrated the start of their 20th anniversary season with an appearance in the final of the St. Andrew's Sixes in 2014. They were defeated by Inverness-shire Camanachd. The Scots continue to enter competitions as of 2018, although they withdrew from the Bullough Cup in the second round giving a walkover to Kyles, having defeated Aberdour in the first round. They took part in the Blue Flash Challenge against Caberfeidh in a friendly match.

This species lives in timber that is floating in the western Pacific Ocean. Description Like other shipworms, Teredora princesae has an elongated, wormlike body which is completely enclosed in a tunnel it has made in floating or submerged timber. At the front end of the animal are two calcareous valves, as found in other bivalve molluscs. These are white and sharp and have rough ridges that are used to rasp the timber and slowly elongate the burrow. Food particles and oxygen are extracted by the gills from the water that has been sucked into the burrow. Waste and reproductive cells are discharged through the opening at the back of the burrow.Shipworm Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. Retrieved 2012-04-13. The life cycle is likely to be similar to other shipworms where the males release their gametes into the water and some of the sperm gets drawn into the burrows of females. The fertilised eggs are retained in the mothers' gill chambers where they begin their development. Later they are released into the sea as veliger larvae. These eat phytoplankton and drift with the currents. When they are ready to undergo metamorphosis they try to find suitable timber on which to settle. There they begin to bore into the wood and spend the rest of their lives as tunnellers.Shipworm lifecycle K√ºstenbiologie Kai Hoppe. Retrieved 2012-04-13.

Habitat and travels Tree trunks of the Douglas-fir and other colder-climate trees sometimes wash up on the shores of the tropical Hawaiian Archipelago. The logs are from trees which grew in North America, and that have been carried to Hawaii by the southern branch of the Japanese Current, taking an estimated two years to travel the distance. Within these logs are excavations that were made by the shipworm,Teredora princesae. Inside the shipworm burrows, which may reach a length of , are the remains of the shipworms and their shells. Then shipworms do not survive the long journey. No living adult shipworms of this species have been found in Hawaii or in North America. The excavations within the wood are of varying lengths and diameters, and it appears to be the case that the whole of the life cycle of this species of shipworm takes place in mid-ocean, with larvae settling on the timber and reproducing there as the wood slowly drifts along on the current.

Overview Ignorance management has been described by John Israilidis, Russell Lock, and Louise Cooke of Loughborough University as: The key principle of this theory is that knowledge management (KM) could better be seen as ignorance management, due to the fact that it is impossible for someone to comprehend and understand everything in a complete way. The only real wisdom is in recognising the limits and extent of one's knowledge, and therefore KM is essentially a matter of sharing the extent of one's ignorance with other people, and thus learning together. This process of knowing what is needed to know, and also acknowledging the power of understanding the unknown, could develop a tacit understanding and could improve both short-term opportunistic value capture and longer term business sustainability.Israilidis et al. 2012 Research Several attempts have been made to explore the value of managing organisational ignorance in order to prevent failures within knowledge transfer contexts. The need to recognise the role and significance of power in the management of ignorance has been introduced to further enhance such efforts.Roberts, J. (2009) From Knowledge Management to Ignorance Management. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Organizational Learning Knowledge and Capabilities, Amsterdam, Netherlands, 26‚Äì28 April. Also, a growing body of psychology research shows that humans find it intrinsically difficult to get a sense of what we don‚Äôt know, and argues that incompetence deprives people of the ability to recognise their own incompetence (the Dunning‚ÄìKruger effect).Wolchover, N. (2012) Incompetent People Too Ignorant to Know It. Retrieved 28 February 2012.

He represented Prince Albert in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan from 1925 to 1939 as a Liberal. He was born in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan (then a district of the Northwest Territories), the son of Thomas Osborne Davis, and was educated there and at St. John's College and Osgoode Hall. Davis then practised law in Prince Albert and later served two terms as alderman for the city; he was mayor from 1921 to 1924. Davis served in the provincial cabinet as Minister of Municipal Affairs and as Attorney General. He helped convince William Lyon Mackenzie King to create Prince Albert National Park, which was opened in 1928. In 1929, Davis defeated John Diefenbaker to retain his seat in the provincial assembly. He resigned his seat in the provincial assembly in 1939 to become a judge in the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal. Davis' judicial career ended in 1940 when he was named federal Deputy Minister of War Services; however, he did not resign from the Court of Appeal until 1948. He was named Canadian High Commissioner to Australia in 1943 and went on to serve as ambassador to China, Japan and West Germany. Davis retired from diplomatic service in 1957, moving to Victoria.

Its flowers are white, similar to white clover (Trifolium repens), with which it has long been confused. This species lives almost exclusively in sand dunes and sea cliffs on the Atlantic coast of Europe, especially Cornwall and the Channel Islands. The species was first described in 1961 by Dr David E Coombe of Cambridge University. Distribution and habitat Trifolium occidentale is a \\"self-compatible, diploid, stoloniferous\\" perennial herb, found only within 100 metres of the coast, in western Europe. It inhabits sandy dunes, including dune and dry short coastal grasslands and sea cliffs, especially around rock outcrops. Its range extends from the east coast of Ireland and the southern British Isles such as Cornwall, the Channel Islands and Isle of Scilly in particular, to the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula, although much less common. In France, it is found on the shores of the Armorican Massif and Normandy and Brittany. It was discovered in Ireland in June 1979 and in Wales in 1987. In Ireland it is found \\"at intervals along the coast from Skerries in north County Dublin to Forlorn Point, County Wexford. It is most common on the Cornish coast.

Since 1967, Landesa has helped more than 180 million poor families in 50 countries gain legal control over their land. When families have secure rights to land, they can invest in their land to sustainably increase their harvests and reap the benefits‚Äîimproved nutrition, health, education, and dignity. Landesa partners with governments, world leaders, NGOs, foundations, donor agencies such as the World Bank, USAID, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, and others to design and implement land laws, policies and programs that provide opportunity, further economic growth, and promote social justice through land rights. Based in Seattle, Landesa has program offices in Beijing, China; Bhubaneswar, Delhi, Kolkata, Lucknow, and Patna, India; Yangon, Myanmar; and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Landesa currently works in China, Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Mozambique, Myanmar, Rwanda, and Tanzania.  History  Landesa was founded as the Rural Development Institute in 1967 by Professor Roy Prosterman, a Harvard Law School graduate who left his Wall Street career at Sullivan & Cromwell to teach at the University of Washington School of Law where he established the Law in Sustainable Development Program. Troubled by the escalating Vietnam War, Prosterman recognized that secure land rights could provide the rural poor a place to grow food to feed their family and a foundation to raise themselves out of poverty without being forced to join the Viet Cong. His \\"land to the tiller\\" program led to a 30% increase in rice production, and an 80% decrease in Viet Cong recruitment.Prosterman, Roy. Asian Survey, Vol. 10, No.8,pg 751-764, \\"Land-to-the-Tiller in South Vietnam: the Tables Turn\\" Roy Prosterman works with Vietnamese farmers Activities Since its founding, Landesa has had one specific goal: securing land rights for the world's poorest people. This is because more than two billion people lives in extreme poverty, surviving on $2 a day or less. Of those, more than 75 percent live in rural areas and rely on agriculture for their sustenance. Most do not have secure rights to land and therefore, limited opportunity to build a better future for themselves and their family. True ownership of land in the developing world determines access to shelter, income, education, healthcare, and improves economic and nutritional security. Landesa attorneys and land tenure specialists craft a variety of land and law-related institutional reforms to help developing countries bring land rights to their poorest. Upon the invitation of the host government, Landesa's staff conducts field assessments, institutional assessments, legislative drafting and policy advice. Landesa then provide assistance with implementing the new land laws, and can help organize pilot programs. Landesa has been involved - on five continents - with land administration consulting, social impact studies, implementation planning, implementation monitoring, training, public education programs, and program design and management. There are typically five primary elements to this work. # Research in the field to identify existing conditions where new land law/regulations/policies could benefit the locals # Design and develop laws and regulations that create and sustain improved land system programs # Advocate the implications and details of the plan to public officials, future recipients, and other stake holders # Implement plan and assist in monitoring the changes; evaluate the new land system in place and make further modifications and improvements where appropriate One plan will not work for every country, so most of Landesa's time goes into tailoring its work for each specific location. For instance, Landesa's \\"micro-land ownership\\" program in India provides landless families with a micro-plot as small as 1/10 of an acre on which they can build shelter, grow food to supplement the family diet and income, and raise livestock or start a micro- enterprise. Like the idea that started the \\"micro-credit\\" movement, \\"micro- land ownership\\" has the potential to provide opportunity for millions of the world's poorest. Map of all countries in which Landesa has worked Consulting services Landesa's fee-for-service practice focuses on the legal, policy, institutional, and educational issues of land tenure, land access, land market development, land conflicts, land acquisition and resettlement, and land registration systems. thumb Landesa employs a staff of more than 120 worldwide, including over 20 senior land tenure specialists with legal, economic, gender, and agricultural expertise, complemented by a professional staff with livelihood, natural resource management, economics, sociology, and other social science expertise. Landesa also employs a team of research assistants who provide legal research and writing support. Landesa's work focuses primarily on rural and peri-urban contexts in developing and transitional economies. Services include field assessments, institutional assessments, legislative drafting and policy advice, development of follow-on regulations, and procedures, technical support for legal assistance, social impact studies, implementation planning, implementation monitoring, training, public education programs, and program design and management. Global Center for Women's Land Rights Providing secure land rights to women is essential to addressing poverty and hunger around the world. Today, Landesa works in China, India and post-conflict areas of Africa with a focus on women's land rights. Women comprise over 50% of the world's population, are responsible for 60-80% of the world's food production, yet, in many countries, they cannot inherit or own land. The Landesa Center for Women's Land Rights works to help women and girls transform their communities. There is great potential for change: with secure rights to land, women and girls can improve food security, education, health, and economic development for themselves and their families. When women have secure rights to land, they can become investors in their family's future and ensure that their children's needs are met. Studies have found that when women have secure rights to land: * Family nutrition and health improve * Women are less likely to contract and spread HIV/AIDS and are better able to cope with the effects of AIDS * Women are less likely to be victims of domestic violence * Children are more likely to get an education and stay in school longer * Women may have better access to micro-credit In short, investing in women's land rights creates an ripple effect that spreads to her family, village, and beyond. However, in much of the world, while women shoulder the burden of food production, they often don't have secure rights to the land they farm. Although they till the fields, they are often barred from inheriting or owning those fields, a prerogative usually left for their husbands and fathers. To address these challenges and unite the global community in support of women's land rights, the Landesa Center for Women's Land Rights was launched in 2009. Landesa's Center provides resources and training on women's land rights and connects policymakers, researchers, and practitioners from around the world. Landesa's Center pilots solutions to women's lack of secure land rights. It educates development experts about the gap between customary and institutional law and ensures that this is addressed in Landesa's projects. Landesa's Center ensures that women remain a core focus of Landesa's work to help the world's poorest. Women smile with their land titles = Initiatives = Global Fellowship Program Landesa's Global Fellowship Program provides training opportunities for qualified professionals seeking to pursue a career in helping to secure land and property rights for women and girls. The program is designed to provide a career path and specialized training opportunities for legal professionals in the U.S., experienced professionals in developing countries who could benefit from comparative experience, and experienced non-legal professionals from NGOs who seek comparative legal knowledge. e-Library on Women's Property Rights Landesa's Global Center for Women's Land Rights is building a database of formal laws related to women's land rights from every country in the world. This \\"e-library\\" will also include research on customary law related to women's land rights where available. The e-Library on women's property rights will be an open-source platform, allowing users to share and post laws and related materials on how those laws are practiced thorough a discussion forum. The e-Library will be cross-referenced via topics (widows' rights, dowry, girls' inheritance, etc.) as well as by countries and regions in a variety of languages. This helps legal practitioners and women's advocates create more effective and suitable programming. Girls and Land Daughters do not traditionally inherit land, because they typically move away from the village to their husband's home after marriage. Most girls leave their family homes with no economic asset of their own (such as land), leaving them vulnerable and powerless in their new homes. To address this, Landesa is working in partnership with its partners to help girls gain a critical economic asset‚Äîland‚Äîto reduce their vulnerability to poverty, gender-based violence, HIV, early marriage, and trafficking, and to gain opportunities for a better future.

It is celebrated annually on 11 April. Each year during this day village elders bless the youth wishing them a healthy and prosperous year. On this special blessing day, the male youth offer flowers to the girls, expressing their respect and care towards them, making it a way to strengthen the bond among the youth. Cultural ceremonies Parsem Kut translates to Flower Offering Festival. It is a fun-filled festival celebrated by the youth under the supervision of the village elders. =Ochai prayer= The \\"Ochai\\" (Priest) begins the day by praying to their god \\"TARPA\\" for the well being of the entire village. This prayer includes a ceremony of sacrifice of hen and rice beer to their god. The sacrificial ground is called Doithojol or Boljol in Khelma language. Soon after the prayer, the Ochai marches to Parsem Kut Tunkung (the house of celebration) where youth(only boys) gather to be served the rice beer which is sprinkled by Ochai to make it holy and bring blessing to the youth who drink it. KHELMA DANCE =Flower offering= After getting permission from the village priest the youth boys then march out in the jungle for searching of flowers which they would offer to the youth girls. But there are certain ways of plucking the flowers, without which the youth boys are penalized with certain punishment. The boys cannot cut down the trees from which they pluck flowers nor they can cut down the branches of the flowers. If they do so, either their shirt or turban shall be taken away as a penalty by both the village elders, and the young girls. In order to get his belongings back he has to offer them a rice beer. So, the boys must climb the trees and pluck the flowers with great care from the trees. There is also a particular way of bringing the collection of flowers, the boy will have to bring the flowers into the Partolai (Casket) until they reach the Suangkung (Traditional gate) where they will have to leave the p√¢rtolai and replace the flowers into a Tabong (Basket) and bring them to Parsem Kut Tunkung (celebration house) with great care. The boys then march out taking flowers to be serving in each house where young girls are present. =Teenage girls= On this day the teenage girls are accepted into adulthood by the offering of these flowers. Even a newly married woman can be offered flowers for two years from the day of her marriage, but after two years of marriage she has to perform a certain ritual, called \\"RUOLM√ÇK\\",\\" on this day which means leaving the life of the youth, or \\"LEAVING HER FRIEND\\". During this ritual, she offers rice beer to her friends on this day, after which she will no longer be considered one of the youth. In every house the parents will keep a Lukham (Wooden seat) near the door inside the house, and the boys will not offer the flowers in the hand of the girls but will put it 3 (three) flowers for each girl, in case there are three girls in the same house then the parents will have to place 3 Lukham for each girl. The girls then proceed towards the Parsem Kut Tunkung (celebration house) with the flowers tucked behind each ear and one on their hairs. But if by any chance she drops even one of them she will be penalized by the boys, either by taking of their belt or their necklace as a token of fine and in order to get back her belonging she has to offer rice beer to them. =After dawn= After dawn of the P√¢rsem K√ªt the celebration is wound up by singing and dancing which includes \\"KA CHIN ALA\\" (Ka chin song). This song is sung in groups which consist of 3 main sub-groups; these are:- 1. Siarsep i.e. Youth 2. Minmangngei i.e. married man 3. Tarpui i.e. old man. The three selected group will sing this same Ka Chin song one after the other and be judged by the other two groups. If mistakes are found during the song routine then the group is fined to offer rice beer to other groups.

Most turbocharged petrol engines use a single turbocharger, however twin-turbo configurations are also often used. In motor racing, turbochargers were used in various forms of motorsport in the 1970s and 1980s. Since the mid-2010s, turbocharging has returned to several motor racing categories, such as Formula One and the World Rally Championship. Several motorcycles in the late 1970s and early 1980s were produced with turbocharged engines. History Turbo Jetfire engine *1962: The first turbocharged production car engine was the Oldsmobile Turbo Jetfire used in the Oldsmobile Jetfire (a modified version of the turbocharger setup was also used in the Chevrolet Corvair Monza Spyder released a month later). A Garrett AiResearch turbocharger with integral wastegate was used. Power was significantly increased over the naturally aspirated (non-turbo) engine, however reliability of these engines was poor and the production of the engine ceased in 1963. * 1965: Beginning this year a turbocharged version of the \\"Comanche\\" 154 cubic inch inline slant four cylinder engine was an option in the International Harvester Scout. This engine developed at 4,000 rpm and at 3,200 rpm and was available until 1967. *1973: The next mass-produced turbocharged car was the BMW 2002 Turbo, introduced at the 1973 Frankfurt motor show and featuring a four-cylinder engine. Due to excessive turbo lag, safety concerns and the 1973/1974 oil crisis, the 2002 Turbo was discontinued in 1974. *1974: At the height of the oil crisis, the Porsche 911 Turbo was introduced, becoming the fastest mass- produced car at the time. The Porsche 911 has been available with a turbocharged engine for the majority of the years since 1974. *1977: The Saab 99 model begins Saab's long run of turbocharged passenger cars. *1978: The \\"LD5\\" version of the Buick V6 engine marks the return of turbocharging to cars produced in the United States. *1978-present: Many manufacturers have produced turbocharged cars. Since the early-2010s, many European cars have switched to smaller, turbocharged engines. This trend has since spread to manufacturers from other regions. Multiple turbochargers = Parallel configuration = A common arrangement for twin-turbo engines, especially on V engines is a parallel configuration. This arrangement uses two identically sized turbos, each fed by a separate set of exhaust streams from the engine. Having two smaller turbos produce the same aggregate amount of boost as a larger single turbo allows them to reach their optimal rpm, more quickly, thus improving boost delivery. = Sequential configuration = Another twin-turbo arrangement commonly used on car engines is a sequential configuration, where one turbo is active across the entire rev range of the engine and the other activates at higher rpm. Below this rpm, both exhaust and air inlet of the secondary turbo are closed. Being individually smaller they have reduced lag and having the second turbo operating at a higher rpm range allows it to get to full rotational speed before it is required. Such combinations are referred to as a sequential twin-turbo. Sequential twin-turbo systems are usually more complicated than parallel twin-turbo systems because they require additional wastegate pipes and valves to control the direction of the exhaust gases. = Other configurations = Automobile manufacturers rarely use more than two turbochargers. Some exceptions are the triple-turbocharger system used by the 2012-2017 BMW N57S straight-six diesel engine, the quad-turbocharger system used by the V12 engine in the 1991-1995 Bugatti EB110 and the quad- turbocharger system used by the W16 engine in the 2005-2015 Bugatti Veyron and 2016-present Bugatti Chiron. Motorsport 1970 Toyota 7, twin turbocharged racing car = Indy car racing = The first turbocharged engine in motorsport was the Kurtis Kraft-Cummins Diesel driven by Fred Agabashian. He competed in the 1952 Indianapolis 500, qualifying on pole. However the turbo failed on lap 71 out of 200. Another one of the first uses of turbocharging in motorsport was a turbocharged version of the Offenhauser V8 engine, which first competed at the 1966 Indianapolis 500 and used a Garrett AiResearch turbocharger. This engine won the 1968 Indianapolis 500 and power outputs of over were achieved in 1973. = Sports car racing = In 1972, the Porsche 917/10K became the first turbocharged car to win the Can-Am series. The 917/10K was powered by a turbocharged flat-twelve engine producing up to . = Formula 1 = In Formula One, the original \\"Turbo Era\\" lasted from the 1977 season until the 1988 season. During this era, Renault, Honda, BMW, and Ferrari produced engines with a capacity of able to generate . The first turbocharged Formula One car was the Renault RS01, however early engines often suffered from reliability problems. By the mid-1980s, turbocharged engines dominated Formula One, until they were banned after the 1988 season Turbocharging returned to Formula One for the 2014 season, with turbocharged V6 engines replacing the naturally aspirated V8 engines that were previously used. The turbocharging combined with more powerful energy recovery systems kept the power level similar to the previous V8 engines, despite the smaller capacity and the lower rev limits. = Touring car racing = In the German Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft (DTM) racing series, the \\"Turbo Era\\" of 1985 until 1989 saw Volvo, Alfa Romeo and Ford becoming the first manufacturers to use turbocharged engines. In 1985, the Volvo 240 Turbo won the European Touring Car Championship, before turbochargers were banned at the start of 1990 season due to cost reasons. Since the 2019 season, turbocharging has returned to DTM, with turbocharged inline-four engines (shared with the Japanese Super GT \\"Class One\\" regulations) replacing the previous naturally aspirated V8 engines. =Rally= During the Group B era of 1982-1986, turbocharged engines producing up to dominated the World Rally Championship. Turbocharging returned for the 2012 season and has been used since. WRC rally cars use a turbocharged inline-four engine with a 34 mm restrictor in the air intake system. Motorcycles Turbocharging is rarely used by manufacturers of motorcycles, with the following being the only examples of factory turbocharged motorcycles: * 1978 Kawasaki Z1R-TC * 1982 Honda CX 500 Turbo * 1982-1983 Yamaha XJ 650 Seca Turbo * 1983 Honda CX 650 Turbo * 1983 Suzuki XN85 Turbo * 1983-1985 Kawasaki GPZ750 Turbo References Category:Gasoline engines Category:Supercharging ","title":"Turbocharged petrol engines"},{"id":"35481307","text":"Ja nemam drugi dom (I Have No Other Home) is the eleventh studio album by Yugoslav pop-folk singer Lepa Brena.

He started his Product Design activity in 1969 at Zoppas Elettrodomestici, where he helped in creating the inside team of Industrial Design. In the second half of the 1970s, after a short experience as chief of Design at Nordica (Ski boots), he returned to Zanussi and its electric appliances where he became in charge of the Industrial Design Center from 1982. In 1984 the Zanussi company merged with the Electrolux Group and the Zanussi Industrial Design Center became one of the three major Design Centers that Electrolux had around the world (Stockholm, Pordenone, Columbus). Roberto Pezzetta‚Äôs professional career was indissolubly tied to that of the big multinational company he was working for. The phases of this career were countless and Zanussi Design became tied to Pezzetta's name for more than twenty years. What made him non typical and far from the current Design Management definition within Zanussi Electrolux was the fact that he had a mark all of his own which made his works stand out, as well as his personal commitment in the designing of products. From January 2002 he became Creative Director for the Design of Electrolux Group, with the title of Vice President Design. In 2005, having reached the retirement age, he left this position and is now an Industrial Design Consultant. In June 2016 he has been rewarded \\"Compasso d'Oro Career Award\\". The enthusiasm for his job and the belief that a designer‚Äôs professionalism gets energy from experiences born in various fields, have always pushed him to approach different fields in the application of Industrial Design. In fact, he co-operates with many companies and shows, facing themes about Industrial Design on a 360¬∞ radius. He is fascinated by the world of communication (in one of his latest works he also touched on the world of the Augmented Reality) and his projects don't stop at the technical formal solution, but push further to the research of the object that can express itself with character, liking and a lot of irony.. In October 2003, an exhibition titled \\"La Fabbrica e...i Sogni\\" (The Factory and...the Dreams) was dedicated to him in Oderzo, and it not only summarized the work done for Zanussi Electrolux within the period of time from 1982 until 2002 when he was directly in charge of the Design Center, but it was also dedicated to works he had done for many other companies over the years. The exhibition is documented in a short video: Roberto Pezzetta Works on YouTube. \\"The more you enlarge the diameter of your knowledge, the greater the radius of your ignorance.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. The building is located on State Street, in the southeastern part of the historical center of Santa Barbara, California, immediately next to the Highway 101. The building is one of the few examples of Moorish architecture in Santa Barbara. History What is now the rear part of the building was constructed in 1911, 1913, and 1917 as four brick garages. They were connected by a two-storey front-wall construction made of brick and concrete. The first floor contained auto-sales shops, whereas the second one housed the El Camino hotel. The building was owned by Henry Ernest Bothin, previously a San Francisco wealthy merchant, who moved to Santa Barbara in 1911. Since the highway 101 was completed about the same time, the area, which was adjacent to the highway, contained multiple garages and hotels. The front portion was damaged by the 1925 earthquake. It was subsequently demolished and replaced by the front section in Moorish style which is still standing today. It was designed by a San Franciscan architect Lionel Pries. Generally, the downtown of Santa Barbara was rebuilt in the Colonial Revival style, and the Andalucia building, which preserved the Moorish appearance, became one of the few exceptions, which later earned it a listing in the National Register of Historic Places. In 1937, the building was converted into offices for Seaside Oil Company. The remodeling was performed by local architects Carleton Winslow and R. H. Pitman. In the same year, the rear was remodeled so that a part of the brickstone wall was replaced by an opening. The project was designed by Chester Carjola, also a local architect. The building subsequently changed owners several times, which led to less extensive remodeling works. Architecture The building is a block which consists of four one-floor brick rectangular buildings with gable roofs.

Ruya and Rafa  In popular culture, Ruya was first used to describe tennis star Rafael Nadal on the Baidu Rafa Post Bar (rafa Bar of Baidu Tieba). The post pointed out that Nadal never curses against his opponent; instead, he always gives credit to them. He never abuses his racquet, never gives up, and uses all means possible to achieve victory. These traits fit the meaning of the word \\"Ruya\\". With the close resemblance of the pronunciation of Ruya and Rafa, many message board posters started to use Ruya as Nadal's nickname.  The phenomenon of Ruya  The phenomenon of spreading Ruya continues through the Chinese sporting world. Besides Rafael Nadal, other tennis players have been considered as Ruya, including Australian Bernard Tomic and former WTA World No.1 Victoria Azarenka. Today, the word generally describes individuals with conflicting sides of being modest in public, but yet using all means to self-serve in their personal nature.

Background The previous state election in May 1947 had resulted in the Liberal‚ÄìCountry coalition led by Thomas Hollway winning by a substantial majority. In late 1948, Country leader and Deputy Premier John McDonald criticised Hollway over his \\"lack of strength\\" in dealing with a long-running transport strike, and his conciliatory negotiations with the transport unions. Hollway responded by sacking McDonald as his deputy and dissolving the coalition. The Country Party became the official opposition (with three seats more than Labor in the assembly). Hollway formed a minority Liberal government, convincing four Country Party assembly members (Guye, Hedditch, Hipworth and Mibus) to defect to his party, which he provocatively renamed the Liberal and Country Party. Despite lacking a majority, Hollway's government survived for nearly a year due to the support of two Country members (Bennett and Hyland) and the casting vote of the Speaker, Sir Thomas Maltby, in vital divisions. In February 1950, the LCP voted to expel two members of the parliamentary party‚ÄîFred Edmunds and John Lechte‚Äîfor disloyalty, reducing the government's members to 30. On 12 April, the Governor of Victoria, Sir Dallas Brooks, summoned McDonald and Labor leader John Cain to gain their assurance that they would not form a joint ministry. Hollway was then summoned, and agreeing that the house had become unworkable and that there was no chance of the LCP and Country Party reconciling, was granted a dissolution of the assembly. Labor had lost the seat of Geelong to the Liberals in a 1948 by-election following the death of Fanny Brownbill. Former Premier and member for Korong, Sir Albert Dunstan, died suddenly on 14 April, the day after the dissolution of the Legislative Assembly and the issue of the election writs.

A notable example is the Saalfelder Ostereierbaum (Saalfeld Easter egg tree) in Saalfeld, Thuringia.  History  The tradition in Germany to decorate the branches of trees and bushes with eggs for Easter is centuries old, but its origins have been lost. The egg is an ancient symbol of life all over the world. Eggs are hung on branches of outdoor trees and bushes and on cut branches inside. The custom is found mostly in Germany, Austria and German-speaking Switzerland , but also in other German-influenced places such as Ukraine, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Moravia, and the Pennsylvania Dutch region of the United States. Egg trees are also sometimes decorated on May Day, Christmas, Whitsun, and the summer solstice. Other German Easter traditions include the dressing of public wells as Osterbrunnen, Osterhasen (Easter Hares) and Osterfeuer (Easter bonfires).  Saalfelder Ostereierbaum  At the Saalfelder Ostereierbaum with Mr. Kraft in Saalfeld: was decorated from 1965 - 2015. An exceptional example is Saalfelder Ostereierbaum, an apple tree in the garden of Volker Kraft in Saalfeld, Thuringia. Kraft and his family have been decorating the tree since 1965, starting with just 18 plastic eggs. This had been a childhood dream of Volker Kraft since he saw his first Easter \\"tree\\", a lilac bush which he passed on the way to school as a youth in 1945. By 1994 the Krafts had increased the number of eggs to about 350 pieces. As the tree grew, they needed more eggs for decorating. The Krafts blew out almost all the eggs used in their household during the year and reused the eggs each year. Between 1994 and 2009, the family hung an annual average of 700 new Easter eggs on the tree, but due to losses by storm and vandalism, the net annual average increase was 590 eggs. In 2012 there were over 10,000 eggs on the Easter egg tree, and Kraft said that he would not try to hang more. The tree in Saalfeld does not hold the record for the most eggs on one tree. That honor belongs to the Rostock Zoo, which in April 2007 decorated a red oak with 79,596 blown and painted eggs, which earned it an entry in Guinness World Records. In 1995, a ver.di training center was built in the immediate vicinity, bringing more visitors and national fame to the Kraft Easter egg tree. Beginning in 2003 newspapers from the Netherlands, Kuwait, Austria, Spain, Australia, Thailand, US, and South Africa began reporting on the Kraft Easter egg tree. Crowds of visitors have continuously come since then. The entrance is free, but for curiosity the visitors were counted in 2011 as about 8,000. = Decoration = Depending on the weather and the date of Easter, the family begins hanging eggs on the tree between late February and late March, roughly four weeks before Easter. In 2009 it took them nine days to decorate the tree; the task involved family members, especially Volker Kraft, his wife Christa, and daughter Gabriela Rumrich. They use ladders to reach the heights of the tree, and hang the eggs working from the inside near the trunk to outside of the tree branches, and from top to bottom. They remove the eggs before the leaves grow to prevent damage to the tree. = Design of the eggs = All eggs are mouth-blown. Some are sprayed with one or more multicolored patterns. Some eggs are painted with motifs found in the city, such as the city gates or the home-museum, but world-famous buildings are also used as motifs. Many eggs are covered in crochet and protected against further weathering. New themes are used every year. They perforate some eggs for decoration, and others are enhanced with clay for transformation to shapes such as frogs, turtles, hedgehogs, and hot air balloons.

It publishes news about science and research from Norway and abroad. The web site is run by Foreningen for drift av forskning.no, a non-profit organization which has 78 research institutions as members. forskning.no has its own writers and journalists and freelance writers. In addition articles are submitted by the research institutes and then edited by forskning.no staff before being published. While the newspaper has owners, the editor and journalists choose what to write. forskning.no is an independent newspaper run after the rules of The Association of Norwegian Editors. They cooperate with the corresponding Danish online newspaper, videnskab.dk, among other things about the English-language news service, sciencenordic.com, which was established in 2011. forskning.no has an average of 33,000 visits per day in January 2016 and 1 million visits per month. Nina Kristiansen is the editor in charge since 2007. She took over after Erik Tunstad. History forskning.no was launched in 2002. The site's initial editor was Erik Tunstad at the time and first managing director was Steinar Q. Andersen. The site was launched in 2002 after the initiative of the Research Council of Norway, and a total of 12 research institutions participated in the establishment. The idea was simple: to establish a dissemination information campaign, and then hand over the control to an independent editorial staff, working under The Association of Norwegian Editors and in accordance with Code of Ethics of the Norwegian Press. An editorial of three, later five people, was established in a small yellow house at M√∏lla in Oslo. Ingrid Spilde and Arnfinn Christensen are the only ones left from the beginning, who are still working in forskning.no today. Today there are 77 research and education institutions that participate in the cooperation. These can also make submissions, which is considered and edited, and which is clearly marked with the institution as the sender. The editorial staff consists of 14 people: journalists, editor, editorial director and editors.

Print for people across all economic and social barriers, and to educate individuals, communities, food producers and creative artisans about the impact that available and affordable fresh food can have on health and quality of life. Overview While the NFMA promotes health and quality of life around farmers markets, it does not seek to compete with grocery stores or supermarkets. The organization recognizes the inherent value in the farmers market as a resource for making connections within a community, especially in areas of the country where grocery stores and supermarkets are not present. The NFMA operates within a local area by recruiting volunteers that reach out to educate community members, connect people to farmers markets, and help food desert communities learn how to get Farmers Markets into their areas. Food deserts are areas where fresh, quality food is too far to reach or not affordable.Sommer, Robert. Farmers Markets of America. Santa Barbara: Capra, 1980. Print. History The National Farmers Market Association was conceived as a program by a former Meals On Wheels executive director who saw in the communities his organization served a general lack of knowledge about nutrition and the benefits of fresh fruits and vegetables. The group he created that began the NFMA also saw how farmers‚Äô markets became a center for people not just to shop, but to connect with each other, for public service organizations to conduct outreach, for artists and musicians to express their talent and be seen.Chiras, Dan: Superbia! 31 Ways to Create Sustainable Neighborhoods, 2003.

ETI deduction benefits are not available for transactions entered into after 2006.  Extraterritorial income exclusion Extraterritorial income exclusion, under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, was the amount excluded from a taxpayer's gross income for certain transactions that generate foreign trading gross receipts. In general, foreign trading gross receipts include gross receipts from the sale, exchange, lease, rental, or other disposition of qualifying foreign trade property. Foreign trading gross receipts also include receipts from certain services provided in connection with such property, as well as engineering and architectural services for construction projects outside the United States. Extraterritorial income is the gross income of the taxpayer attributable to foreign trading gross receipts. The taxpayer reported all of its extraterritorial income on its tax return. The taxpayer used Form 8873 to calculate its exclusion from income that is qualifying foreign trade income.  Qualifying foreign trade property  Qualifying foreign trade property generally includes property that is held primarily for sale or lease for direct use or consumption outside the United States. Form 8873 is attached to the taxpayers income tax return. Both corporate and non-corporate taxpayers who have qualifying transactions may now be required to file Form 8873. The exclusion reported on Form 8873 was created by the Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC) Repeal and Extraterritorial Income Exclusion Act of 2000. The new exclusion applies to certain transactions entered into after September 30, 2000, but is subject to transition rules for foreign corporations with a valid FSC election in effect on September 30, 2000.  Extra-Territorial Income Exclusion Act  The FSC Repeal and Extraterritorial Income Exclusion Act of 2000Pub. L. No. 106-519 (Nov. 15, 2000). effectively 'repatriated' the FSC tax break and extended it to all types of entities with qualifying foreign sales, including S corporations and Limited liability companies previously excluded. Foreign companies that are U.S. taxpayers could also use the tax break, which was not the case previously. There are rules requiring a certain proportion of U.S.-manufactured content and a certain proportion of foreign costs. Foreign tax credits on the goods concerned are not available to a participating entity. Actual manufacture can take place either inside or outside the United States. As under the previous law, the benefit applied to exports and a 50% U.S.-content rule remained. Those features caused the new regime to continue to resemble an export tax subsidy. In response, the Administration pointed to the elimination of administrative transfer pricing rules. However, the separate company requirement of the FSC and DISC legislation had been eliminated. Without the need for two companies ‚Äì a manufacturing company and a sales company ‚Äì no need existed for transfer pricing rules. The European Union (EU) did not accept the new legislation as conforming with WTO rules. After a long series of hearings and appeals, the WTO ruled definitively against the ETI rules in late 2002. The EU then prepared a list of U.S. products on which the EU intended to apply sanctions in the form of countervailing duties. The EU obtained the WTO's permission for such action, which the EU put into effect in early 2004 in the absence of a substantial change in the ETI regime. The phase-out/repeal of the ETI deduction described above is considered to be the response to this threat.

The Church of Saint Senara, Zennor is dedicated to her; the village, nearby headland Zennor Head, and the neolithic tomb Zennor Quoit received her name indirectly. Historical records According to scholar Nicholas Orme, a Saint Sinar of Zennor was first recorded in 1170 as a male saint (\\"Sanctus Sinar\\"), but from 1235 onwards as a female one (\\"Sancta Sinara\\"). Orme states that unless she can be identified with Azenor, the mother of Saint Budoc in Breton legends, nothing else is recorded about her. He also points out the similarity to Saint Senan, commemorated at nearby Sennen. Legend Senara was reputedly a Breton princess of Brest originally named Asenora,Bede, Eccl. Hist. Book 3, chapter 23. a woman described as having a \\"rather dubious reputation\\" before her conversion. She was married to a Breton king who wrongly accused her of adultery and threw her into the sea in a barrel while pregnant. She was visited by an angel, whilst floating in the sea off the westernmost end of Cornwall, and gave birth to a son in the waves, who later became Saint Budoc or an Irish bishop. She was washed up on the Cornish coast, and some believe she founded Zennor and gave her name to the eponymous village (and subsequently Zennor Head, Zennor Quoit and Porthzennor Cove), before continuing to Ireland. Due to the striking similarity, the legend's origins possibly lie in Greek mythology and the story of Dana√´ who was also cast to sea with her son Perseus in a wooden box. Legacy The \\"mermaid chair\\" in Zennor church Senara was highly venerated by local fishermen and is said to represent the dual nature of Christ (human and divine). Medieval folk regarded her as a symbol of lust and a warning against the sins of the flesh due to her story of purported adultery and subsequent conversion. She gives her name to St Senara's Church in Zennor and it contains the Mermaid Chair, an ancient chair with carvings of fish on the seat and a pew end with a depiction of the mermaid admiring herself in a mirror, which is believed to be at least 600 years old.Ancient Worlds Celtia, Saint Senara, retrieved 13/04/2012 A statue of St Senara lies in an enclosed garden next to the church.

Part of the X series from Fujifilm, the X100 series includes the FinePix X100, X100S, X100T, X100F, and X100V. They each have a large image sensor and a 23 mm lens (35 mm equivalent angle of view in full frame format). All five cameras have received generally positive reviews. Fujifilm FinePix X100 Alt text The Fujifilm FinePix X100 was initially shown at the photokina show in September 2010 and was subsequently introduced in February 2011. It was the first model in the Fujifilm X-series of cameras and has since been joined by numerous models. It is superseded by the Fujifilm X100S. =Key features= * 12.3 MP, APS-C sized CMOS sensor * Hybrid optical/electric viewfinder * 23 mm (35 mm equivalentEquivalent angle of view in full frame format) fixed prime lens * Classic styling =Innovation= The FinePix X100 was the first camera to show a number of new technologies developed by Fujifilm. These include a hybrid viewfinder which allows the user to choose between a conventional optical viewfinder with an electronic overlay, or an electronic viewfinder. The combination of APS-C sized CMOS sensor, EXR processor and 23mm (35 mm equivalent) fast aperture lens was also a first. =Reception= The X100 received generally favourable reviews and a number of awards. These include Innovative Camera of the Year from Ephotozine and Best Premium Camera in the 2011 TIPA awards. In most cases, the prizes were awarded for the combination of technology and picture quality, but the X100 has also received plaudits for its design outside the photography market, coming top of Stuff magazine's Cool List for 2011 and in October 2012 receiving Good Design Award from Good Design Award (Japan). Digital Photography Review gave it a score of 75% and a silver award, noting that it \\"combines excellent image quality, solid build and a superb viewfinder with somewhat sluggish and quirky operation\\", adding that \\"It's been much improved by multiple firmware updates since its initial incarnation, and despite its flaws, is now a very likeable camera indeed.\\". =Issues= Some X100 cameras have reportedly suffered from 'sticky aperture disease' where the aperture blades lock up, leading to overexposure. Fujifilm has acknowledged this issue and will fix it under warranty. On initial release the X100 was widely reported to have various issues. Many, but not all, of these issues were fixed through a series of firmware updates made available by Fujifilm. Fujifilm X100S Alt text The Fujifilm X100S is the successor to the Fujifilm FinePix X100. Announced in January 2013, it is a model similar to the X100 yet addressing some of the issues that the X100 had, and resembles it superficially, but with internal changes. It has been compared with the Leica M series. It was replaced in September 2014 with the Fujifilm X100T. =Differences from the X100= * 16.3 MP Fujifilm X-Trans CMOS II sensor instead of 12.3 MP CMOS sensor with primary colour filter (Bayer filter) * Redesign of menus * Quick Menu (Q) button * Uses X-Trans color filter pattern (taken from the X-E1 and X-Pro1), instead of Bayer pattern * No optical low pass filter (OLPF), to give sharper images * Phase detection within the X-Trans CMOS II sensor increasing autofocus speed to 0.08 s in good light * The faster the focus ring is rotated, the quicker the focus is adjusted * Focus mode switch options have been reorganised such that the most commonly used functions (Autofocus Single and Manual Focus) surround the least used function (Autofocus Continuous) for more efficient operation * Hybrid viewfinder switch has been altered in shape to allow for easier one-handed operation * Autofocus point selection has been altered to allow one button default access =Reception= The X100S received generally positive reviews: * Digital Photography Review gave it a score of 81% and a gold award, describing it as a \\"hugely likable, very capable camera with some useful tricks up its sleeve\\". * Photography Life gave it 4.6 stars out of 5, describing it as \\"an amazing camera\\". Fujifilm X100T Alt text The Fujifilm X100T was announced by Fujifilm on September 10, 2014. It is the successor to the X100S. It is visually very similar to the X100S, and shares many of its core specifications (including its lens and sensor), but features numerous iterative refinements and enhancements. It has the same 16.3 MP Fujifilm X-Trans CMOS II sensor as the X100S. It was replaced in January 2017 with the Fujifilm X100F. =Differences from the X100S= * Advanced hybrid viewfinder, with electronic rangefinder * Real-time parallax correction in optical viewfinder * ¬±3EV exposure compensation * optional electronic shutter (allowing silent operation and a shutter speed of 1/32000 of a second) * 3.0-inch, 1040K-dot LCD screen * \\"Classic Chrome\\" film simulation mode * Built-in Wi-Fi * Face recognition (when enabled, focuses automatically on the faces in the frame) =Reception= The X100T has received generally positive reviews: * Digital Photography Review gave it a score of 81%, criticising its autofocus and video capabilities but noting \\"there's currently nothing to touch it in terms of the size/price/image quality balance it offers and the style with which it does so\\". * Pocket-Lint.com gave it 4 stars out of 5, describing it as \\"a special little camera\\" Fujifilm X100F Alt text The Fujifilm X100F (Fourth), announced on January 19, 2017 is the successor to the Fujifilm X100T. It features a number of improvements and refinements over the previous model, many of which were first introduced with the Fujifilm X-Pro2. The X100F was released on February 23, 2017. =Differences from the X100T= * A third-generation 24.3 MP X-Trans CMOS III sensor * X-Processor Pro image processor * A new button layout with a joystick autofocus control (similar to X-Pro2 and X-T2), making it easier to select AF points * Built-In ISO dial * Added command dial on the front of the camera * C mode on exposure compensation dial, allowing up to 5 stops exposure compensation * A larger battery, model NP-W126S (same as X-T2) * An improved 91-point autofocus system * Improved sensitivity (ISO 200‚Äì12800, expandable to ISO 100‚Äì51200) * Viewfinder has 6x magnification * Acros film simulation * 60 fps EVF refresh rate * Additional continuous shooting mode speeds (3, 4, 5, and 8 fps) along with larger buffer * New LED AF lamp * Digital teleconverter simulating 50 mm and 70 mm perspectives (JPG only) =Reception= The X100F was very well received, mostly for its improved sensor and autofocus capability. Digital Photography Review gave it a score of 83% and a gold award, calling it \\"a true photographers' camera\\". At the 2017 Technical Image Press Association Awards, the X100F won the award for best professional compact camera.  Fujifilm X100V  Alt text The Fujifilm X100V (Roman Numeral \\"Fifth\\"), announced on February 4, 2020 is the successor to the Fujifilm X100F. It features a redesigned lens, the 4th generation of X-Trans sensor, a 2-way tilting rear LCD screen, and an ‚Äúoptional‚Äù weather resistance. The camera also includes the new film simulations and other software tricks. The X100V is $100 more expensive that its predecessor, the X100F. With its upgraded glass, it should exhibit less distortion than the previous X100 cameras and has should have an improved close focus performance. = Differences from the X100F = * A fourth-generation 26.1 MP X-Trans CMOS sensor *Sharper 23 mm ∆í/2.0 lens *4K Video recording *2-way tilting rear LCD screen *Touchscreen *Weather resistance *Larger Viewfinder *More focus points with 425 *Bluetooth *UHS I Card Support *Faster Continuous Shooting at 11 fps = Reception = The X100V is a well received camera, being praised for its updated sensor that offers good noise performance and fast readout as well as its highly tunable JPEG engine that reduces noise very well producing good detail. It's also praised for its 4k recording feature, a first for the series. Digital Photography Review gave it a score of 86% and a gold award, calling it \\"The most capable prime-lens compact camera, ever\\". Accessories Due to their similarities, the different X100 cameras accept many of the same accessories. =Conversion lenses= * Wide Conversion Lens WCL-X100 II - gives a magnification factor to the 23 mm fixed lens of 0.8√ó, providing a focal length of 19 mm (28 mm equivalentEquivalent angle of view in full frame format) * Tele Conversion Lens TCL-X100 II - multiplies the 23 mm fixed lens by approximately 1.4√ó, providing an equivalent focal length of 33 mm (50 mm equivalent angle of view)http://www.fujifilm.com/news/n140416_02.html =Flashguns= * Fujifilm EF-20 * Fujifilm EF-X20 * Fujifilm EF-42 See also * Fujifilm X series * Fujifilm cameras Notes References  External links  * Official website of the original Finepix X100 (Wayback Machine Archive) * Official Fujifilm Global website of the original Finepix X100 * Official Fujifilm Global website of the X100S * Official Fujifilm Global website of the X100T * Official Fujifilm Global website of the X100F * X100 Category:Mirrorless cameras Category:Products introduced in 2010 Category:Products introduced in 2013 Category:Products introduced in 2014 ","title":"Fujifilm X100"},{"id":"35481908","text":"William Cotton was the Archdeacon of Totnes.Some Account of the Barony and Town of Okehampton: Its antiquities and institutions.

It is the best preserved castle ruin in the French-speaking Bernese Jura. History During the 11th century, the Lords of Erguel, or Arguel, moved from Franche-Comt√© and settled in the village of Sonvilier. Exactly when they built Erguel Castle on a hill south-east of the village is unknown, but in 1178 and 1184 Heinrich von Ergu√´l was mentioned ruling over the region.Burgenwelt.de - History section of Ch√¢teau d'Ergu√´l accessed 13 April 2012 The knights of Erguel owned land in the surrounding valley and held the vogt office over the church at Saint-Imier. The family kept the castle, the surrounding land and the lordship until 1264 when Otto von Erguel, who at the time lived in Basel, ceded them to the Prince-Bishop of Basel. In return the bishop granted him lands in Alsace. The bishop appointed a bailiff for the castle, but administered the extended lands out of Biel. The castle was the southernmost point in the episcopal dominion. Under Bishop Heinrich of Isny (1275-1286) the castle was strengthened and expanded. The currently visible parts of the castle probably all date to this construction period. It can be assumed that the visible parts of the plant today to go back to that time. In 1368 Bishop Johann of Venningen went to war against Bern. Troops from Bern and Biel attacked, captured and burned Erguel Castle. It must have been rebuilt, since in 1417 there was a castellan at the castle. Later, it was used as a prison for several decades. In 1617 Bishop Wilhelm Rinck of Baldenstein repaired the castle and stationed a garrison there to protect his land against the city of Biel. During the Thirty Years War, in 1636, it was used as housing and storage for Swedish troops. In 1750, the diocese decided to lease the half-ruined castle. However, the lease contained the condition that the dilapidated building must be well maintained and they were unable to find a tenant. Four years later, the diocese decided to just abandon it and let the castle collapse. The castle estates were awarded to the municipality of La Ferri√®re in 1767 and acquired in 1847 by the municipality of Sonvilier. During the 19th and 20th centuries there were several archeological digs and attempts to preserve the site. The first excavations were carried out on the castle grounds in 1884. The walls were repaired in 1929-1931 and 1964-1965. The most recent complete renovation of the ruins was in 1997-1998. Castle site View to the ruins from Sonvilier The castle is a long, narrow structure that runs east-west on an exposed hilltop south of Sonvilier. The castle gate house is on the eastern side of site and is still visible. A large, round bergfried is south and west of the gate house. The tower has thick walls at the base and was probably about tall though only part of the tower still exists. The living quarters and court stretch west of the gate house and bergfried. Portions of the walls of the chapel, stable and kitchens in the living quarters still exist. A map from 1617 indicated that there was a semi- circular tower as the western end of the castle, but no trace of the tower still exists.

Her work explores rites of passage, and the visual currencies of group identification and is particularly concerned with highlighting the art forms and self-expression of her often marginalised subjects. She is perhaps best known for her bodies of work exploring the relationship between person and environment in South Africa. In 2010 she was a winner of Spier Contemporary.  Early life  de Clermont's childhood was split between London and the Isle of Man, where her grandfather Charles Birkin, the renowned writer of gothic horror stories, lived. She briefly modelled in London in her late teens, including for publications such as iD Magazine,iD,The Politics Issue a magazine pioneering The Straight Up, a documentary portraiture style her own work can be seen to echo.  Education  de Clermont studied Architecture at The Bartlett University College London, gaining a BSc, before turning to photography, which she studied first at Central St Martins School of Art, and later at Ruth Prowse School of Art, following a move to Cape Town. In 2008 she was selected to take part in a master class led by Stephen Shore.  Career  de Clermont worked initially as a staff photographer at The Sunday Times, under picture editor Greg Marinovich. \\"A complete education in itself, both in photography and in the realities of a nation attempting to recover\\". She later turned freelance to enable her to concentrate on her own bodies of work, while continuing to contribute to the paper, as well as shooting for various English publications including The Guardian, The Times and The Sunday Times.  Works  Her main series have a universal theme of metamorphosis, with all those photographed having undergone intense physical transformations mirroring deep inner changes that they have either gone through, are going through, or hope to go through, whether for a night, several months, or for a period of years. = \\"Life After\\", 2008 = Life After is an exploration into the tattoos and lives of members of the South African prison gangs The Numbers Gang upon their release back into society after many years, if not decades, in prison. de Clermont was Initially interested in documenting the marks for their own sakes, and exploring the motives behind such extensive tattooing: whether it was about a need to belong, or whether it simply reflected an absolute immersion in ‚ÄúThe Number‚Äù, whether the tattoos created an armour, or whether they instead offered a voice, a potent form of self-expression, where the prisoners‚Äô skin was perhaps their only remaining possession and form of self-expression. However she became increasingly interested in the men themselves, the journeys they had been on, and perhaps the most pertinent question of all: how they lived with such ‚Äúbranding‚Äù after their prison sentence ended. = \\"Before Life\\", 2009 = Before Life looks at girls from The Cape Flats, (a vast area outlying Cape Town), dressed up for their Matric Dance (South Africa's equivalent of The Prom). In this area, still haunted by all the attendant problems of poverty and displaced communities, the night is a seminal moment for most matriculants and their families. For many families, the youngster may be the first member of their family ever to have completed school, previous generations having been disadvantaged by the apartheid era education system and economic conditions. For others, especially in the cases of more impoverished families, it may primarily be a night of fantasy escapism, a chance to live out their dreams through costume and styling, their first and possibly their last real opportunity to dress up no holds-barred and be the centre of attention. Through her use of stage lighting the youngsters against their home backdrops, de Clermont raises questions about whether such hinterlands can be merely backdrops or whether these environments will in fact swallow the youngster back up, once the spotlights have been switched off. = \\"A New Beginning\\", 2010 = A New Beginning focuses on recently initiated young Xhosa and Sotho men living in the townships and shacklands surrounding Cape Town. For the majority of these young men, the circumcision ritual is a watershed, an apparent opportunity to start a fresh new way of being. For up to 6 months after his time in the bush, a newly initiated man will wear clothing denoting his status as a new man, showing that he has left childhood behind, has gone through the circumcision process (with all the accompanying challenges) and has entered a new phase of life, maturity, and responsibility. Subscribing to certain rigorous guidelines, such attire is instantly recognisable within a particular culture. \\"New\\" Xhosa men, or Amakrwala, will wear blazers, buttoned up shirts, smart trousers, polished shoes and hats. \\"New\\" Sotho men, or Makolwane, will wear traditional blankets, hats, and beads. This outward demonstration of an inner change is a hugely significant part of the process, and a great source of pride. Unknown people will engage with the \\"new man\\" on a completely different level than if he were dressed in his normal clothes. As these suits demand immediate respect, so too do the men wearing them. de Clermont photographed the men wherever she found them, raising questions about the validity of hope and the concept of a new start, when seen in the context of the individual's surroundings and the infrastructure provided by the government.Blink Contemporary Photography, Issue 7  Galleries representing  *Joao Ferreira (South Africa) *Skylight Projects (New York) *Michael Hoppen Contemporary (London)  Collections  *South African National Gallery, Cape Town *Joao Ferreira Gallery, Cape Town *Djangoly Gallery, Nottingham, UK *Trustman Gallery, Boston, USA *Unisa, South Africa *Ellerman Contemporary, South Africa Selected bibliography *\\"THE BIG ISSUE, South Africa\\", collectors edition 2012/2013 *\\"AFRICAN TEXTILES TODAY\\" by Chris Spring, British Museum Press, 2012 *\\"STREET KNOWLEDGE\\"(an encyclopaedia of street culture), by King Adz, Collins, 2010 *\\"STREETBALL\\", a documentary film on The South African Homeless World Cup Football Team, 2010 *\\"SHANTY TOWN PRINCESSES\\", Marie Claire, USA, April 2010 *\\"TALES OF HARDSHIP AND HOPE\\", an interview with Araminta de Clermont, by Janine Stephen, Business Day_Art, March 2009 *\\"FIGURES AND FICTIONS\\" by Tamar Garb, in collaboration with V&A; Museum *\\"BODY OF KNOWLEDGE\\", SNAPPED, African photography Magazine, Issue 3, Dec 2008, published by Bell-Roberts *\\"PRISON INK\\", The Guardian Newspaper, UK, 5 September 2008  Group Exhibitions (Selected)  2012 *\\"CRUEL AND UNUSUAL\\", Noorderlicht, The Netherlands *\\"CRUEL AND UNUSUAL\\", Photoville, New York 2011 *\\"TAYLOR WESSING PORTRAIT PRIZE\\", National Portrait Gallery, London *\\"ARAMINTA DE CLERMONT AND ERIC BALDAUF: AFRICA IN PERSON‚Äù, Riverside Studios, London *‚ÄúLENS: (fractions of contemporary photography in South Africa)‚Äù (University of Stellenbosch Art Museum) *‚ÄúSIMMONS COLLECTS: CELEBRATING WOMEN ARTISTS‚Äù, Simmons College, Boston, USA 2010 *‚ÄúBONANI FESTIVAL 2010‚Äù, Cape Town *‚ÄúSKIN‚Äù, Wellcome Collection, London *‚ÄúDANIELE TAMAGNI and ARAMINTA DE CLERMONT‚Äù, Michael Hoppen Contemporary, London *‚ÄúSTRENGTHS & CONVICTIONS‚Äù, Nobel Peace Centre, Oslo, Norway *‚ÄúA LIFE LESS ORDINARY‚Äù, Ffoto Gallery, Cardiff, Wales, UK *‚ÄúSPIER CONTEMPORARY 2010‚Äù, South Africa *‚ÄúJOBURG ART FAIR‚Äù, Sandton Convention Centre, Johannesburg, South Africa 2009 *‚ÄúSTRENGTHS & CONVICTIONS‚Äù, South African National Gallery *‚ÄúA LIFE LESS ORDINARY‚Äù, Djangoly Gallery, Nottingham, UK *‚ÄúON TOP OF THE WORLD‚Äù, GreenPoint Stadium visitors centre, Cape Town *‚ÄúJOBURG ART FAIR‚Äù, Sandton Convention Centre, Johannesburg *‚ÄúART OF THE HUMAN CANVAS‚Äù, Cape Town International Convention Centre 2008: *‚ÄúHUMAN ANIMAL‚Äù, Trustman Gallery, Boston, USA *‚ÄúJOBURG ART FAIR‚Äù, Sandton Convention Centre, Johannesburg Solo exhibitions 2012 *‚ÄúTRANSFORMATIONS‚Äù, as part of MOP, Casa Labia, Cape Town 2010 *‚ÄúA NEW BEGINNING‚Äù, Joao Ferreira Gallery, Cape Town *‚ÄúBEFORE LIFE‚Äù, Michael Hoppen Contemporary, London, UK 2009 *‚ÄúBEFORE LIFE‚Äù, Joao Ferreira Gallery, Cape Town 2008 *‚ÄúLIFE AFTER‚Äù, artSPACE, Berlin, Germany *‚ÄúLIFE AFTER‚Äù, Joao Ferreira Gallery, Cape Town  References   External links  *De Clermont's website (as retrieved by the Wayback Machine in 2012) *500 Photographers profile *BBC Interview *Mail & Guardian Review Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:Manx photographers Category:British women photographers Category:Alumni of University College London ","title":"Araminta de Clermont"},{"id":"35482077","text":"\\"Angry Andy\\" is the twenty-first episode of the eighth season of the American comedy television series The Office. It was written by Justin Spitzer and directed by Claire Scanlon. The episode aired on NBC in the United States on April 19, 2012. The series‚Äîpresented as if it were a real documentary‚Äîdepicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) returns to the office to find Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) in the manager's chair. After throwing an extreme tantrum and punching a hole in the wall, Andy is fired. Meanwhile, Kelly is forced to choose between Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) and a new man, Ravi (Sendhil Ramamurthy). The episode received a lukewarm response from critics. According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"Angry Andy\\" was viewed by an estimated 4.35 million viewers and received a 2.2 rating/6% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, making it, at the time, the lowest-rated episode of The Office to air. The episode ranked second in its timeslot and was also the highest-rated NBC series of the night. Plot Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) returns to Dunder Mifflin with Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) to find Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) in the manager's chair. Andy enlists Robert California (James Spader) to give Andy his job back, but Nellie refuses to relinquish the job. Robert backs out of the situation, due to his sexual desire for Nellie. Nellie further asserts her authority when she orders Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) to dock Andy's paycheck twice, and she complies. This causes Andy to have sexual performance difficulties with Erin. Erin asks Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) if he had similar problems after his loss of the manager position, which he denies. After Dwight tells Nellie that she has affected Andy's sex life, she begins to feel guilty. She holds a meeting where the office workers share advice on how to sexually perform with Andy, when it is revealed the meeting is about him. After the meeting, when Nellie makes another innuendo about Andy's problems, Erin loses her temper by yelling at Nellie to shut up, throwing her office phone to the ground, followed by Nellie's memo forms, pens, and her caramel. This gives Andy, filled with anger, the freedom to vent by throwing his desk chair at Robert, throwing Nellie's picture frame to the ground, and finally punching his hand through the wall (as he has done once before). When Robert then chooses Nellie as regional manager, Andy refuses to accept a demotion by saying \\"no\\" too many times in a calm way, and a surprised Robert fires him. Though he now has no job, Andy regains his sense of self- confidence and is once again able to perform. Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) is forced to choose between Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) and a new man, Ravi (Sendhil Ramamurthy). Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) set up Kelly and Ravi, her daughter Cece's pediatrician, in hopes of Kelly finally moving on from Ryan. Ryan makes several attempts to get back with Kelly, though everyone finds the attempts pathetic because he can not even say he truly loves her and wants to be with her always (he keeps qualifying all of his feelings for her) and even admits he would prefer she not be with anyone else if she is not going to be with him. Warehouse worker Nate (Mark Proksch) even states that he prefers Ravi to Ryan, despite having never met Ravi and only knowing Ryan (whom he calls Brian) from their brief interaction. Pam eventually says that he is not a nice person, and Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) says he is not boyfriend material. Ryan tells the office he has a love poem for her, which Kelly has no interest in reading. As the staff are heading outside the building to go home, they see Ryan sitting on a steed professing his love (again, in insultingly hedging terms) to Kelly. She responds by saying she is in love with Ravi and hopes to stay friends with Ryan. They hug goodbye, which turns into a make-out session. The episode closes with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam finding and reading Ryan's love poem. Initially scoffing, they are both noticeably moved by it. Tearing up, Jim informs the camera crew that Ryan can never know of the incident. Production \\"Angry Andy\\" guest starred Sendhil Ramamurthy as Ravi. \\"Angry Andy\\" was written by Justin Spitzer, his second writing credit for the season after \\"Garden Party\\". The episode was directed by Claire Scanlon, her first credit for the series. The episode guest stars Sendhil Ramamurthy as Ravi, Pam and Jim's pediatrician. Before the premiere of the episode, it was revealed that Ramamurthy would be introduced as a new romantic interest for Mindy Kaling's character Kelly Kapoor. Writer B. J. Novak explained that Ryan and Kelly \\"go through a heart-wrenching break-up [and the two] end up becoming bitter enemies in the office when she falls in love with an Indian doctor. He's very handsome and a much, much better match for Kelly than Ryan is.\\" TV Fanatic predicted that Ramamurthy's appearance in the show was done so that Kaling could exit the program, due to her commitment to her Fox series The Mindy Project. Reception =Ratings= \\"Angry Andy\\" originally aired on NBC in the United States on April 26, 2012. The episode was viewed by an estimated 4.35 million viewers and received a 2.2 rating/6% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 2.2% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 6% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. In addition, the episode was, at the time, the lowest-rated episode of the series to air, beating the previous episode, \\"Welcome Party\\", which gathered 4.39 million viewers. The episode finished second in its time slot, being beaten by Grey's Anatomy which received a 3.3 rating/9%. The episode beat the Fox series Touch and The CW drama series The Secret Circle, as well as a re-run of the CBS drama Person of Interest. Despite this, \\"Angry Andy\\" was the highest-rated NBC television episode of the night. =Reviews= Critical reception to the episode was largely mixed. Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club awarded the entry a \\"C\\" and thoroughly criticized Nellie's \\"hostile takeover\\" of the Scranton branch, calling it \\"utterly ridiculous\\". McNutt also called most of the humorous moments in the episode \\"too familiar\\", noting that Andy's punching of a wall had already happened on the show. Cindy White of IGN gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10, denoting a \\"good\\" episode, but noted that the show's need to feature a direct flash back to \\"The Return\\" only \\"highlights the lack of [Andy's] character continuity\\" and concluded that the scene came out \\"a bit contrived.\\" M. Giant from Television Without Pity awarded the episode a \\"C+\\". Joseph Kratzer of WhatCulture! gave the episode a largely negative review and awarded it two stars out of five. He criticized the plot invoking Nellie taking the manager position away, as well as Erin's outburst, saying \\"it was warranted but disingenuous\\". Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic awarded the episode three-and-a-half-stars out of five and noted that the return of Andy's anger issues was a \\"pleasant change of pace\\". He concluded that the episode's physical comedy elevated it, ultimately making it \\"certainly an improvement on last week's episode ['Welcome Party']\\". Screencrave reviewer Jeffrey Hyatt awarded the episode a seven out ten but noted that Andy's return and his meltdown \\"didn't wow me\\", but that his increased ego was impressive. Critical reception to the episode's subplot involving Kelly and Ryan was largely positive. McNutt called Novak's acting \\"some of [his] best work in a long time\\". He called the plot‚Äôs conclusion \\"the sort of screwed up situation that The Office does well\\". White wrote that \\"If it weren't for [Kelly and Ravi's] story ... I might have written this clumsy episode off entirely.\\" Forcella enjoyed the plot, praising the ending due to the fact that it concluded with \\"boos and hisses\\". However, he was confused with the casting, noting that \\"why bring Sendhil Ramamurthy in for one scene? ... He seems more like someone you bring in for a multi-episode arc.\\" Hyatt lauded the scenes, and wrote \\"the Ryan-Kelly stuff I give a 10/10.\\" References External links *\\"Angry Andy\\" at NBC.com Category:2012 American television episodes Category:The Office (American season 8) episodes ","title":"Angry Andy"},{"id":"35482099","text":"Jason Pargin (born January 10, 1975), known by his pen name David Wong, is an American humor writer. He is the former executive editor of humor website Cracked.com, a recurring guest in the Cracked Podcast, and has written four novels: John Dies at the End (2007), This Book Is Full of Spiders (2012), Futuristic Violence and Fancy Suits (2015), and What the Hell Did I Just Read (2017). John Dies at the End was adapted into a film of the same name in 2012. Early life Wong was born in Lawrenceville, Illinois. He and fellow Internet writer John Cheese (real name Mack Leighty) attended high school together and met during an art class they shared. Wong then attended the Southern Illinois University (SIU) radio-television program, graduating in 1997. While at SIU, he was part of a TV show on Alt.news cable TV called Consumer Advocate. A number of episodes were produced. He lived in Marion, Illinois until 2014, when he moved to Nashville. PWOT and Cracked In 1999, Wong started his own humor site, Pointless Waste of Time (PWOT), which would eventually be absorbed into Cracked.com. While working as a copy editor at a law firm, he would spend his days copy editing insurance claims and nights posting humor articles on PWOT. Every Halloween on the site he wrote a new chapter of an online story that he published as a webserial. An estimated 70,000 people read the free online versions before they were removed in September 2008. Wong used the feedback from people reading each episode of the webserial to tweak what would eventually become the book, John Dies at the End. Demand Media hired Wong to be the head editor for their revamped online magazine, Cracked.com, although Demand was not aware of Wong's book deal. As part of the deal, he merged PWOT into the Cracked forums. Wong has described a disconnection between the old Cracked print magazine and the humor site Cracked.com due to multiple relaunches and almost entirely new staff. As a child, he read Cracked magazine's biggest competitor, Mad magazine. In a popular article published at Cracked.com, Wong coined the neologism \\"monkeysphere\\" which introduces the concept of Dunbar's number in a humorous manner. Wong referred to Dunbar's number again in his novel, This Book Is Full of Spiders. When Pargin started PWOT, he took on the pseudonym of David Wong to keep his real and online lives separate. Since much of his writing involved situations similar to his real life, he did not want co-workers and his employers to think that his rants about fictional characters were inspired by real people. The origin of the name was a character from one of his first short stories. He writes: After his book and movie deal, his real name became common knowledge, but Pargin accepted it, saying \\"It's not like I'm under the Witness Protection program or anything. I was just trying to keep things simple in my personal life.\\" Published works His first novel John Dies at the End was at first rejected by publishers, and Wong considered taking it down until indie horror publisher Permuted Press agreed to publish the novel in 2007. A second edition by Thomas Dunne Books was published with additional material as a hardcover on September 29, 2009. After enjoying some success, it came to the attention of Don Coscarelli who decided to adapt it as a film. In 2007, Coscarelli optioned the film rights to John Dies at the End. Filming took place from late 2010 until January 2011 at locations in Southern California. The film, starring Chase Williamson, Rob Mayes, Clancy Brown, and Paul Giamatti, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 23, 2012. It also played on March 12, 2012, at South by Southwest, in Austin, Texas. The author stated in January 2018 that Zoey Punches the Future in the Dick (working title), the sequel to Futuristic Violence and Fancy Suits, was nearing completion and scheduled for release in late 2020. The fourth book in the John Dies at the End series is currently under development as well. Bibliography = John and Dave series = Wong, David (2017). What the Hell Did I Just Read.

It explains how people would be affected by the National Health Service Act introduced under Clement Attlee. Synopsis As Charley cycles around his neighbourhood, a narrator explains the aims and merits of the National Health Service Act. The narrator lists other public health services in existence at the time, and mentions problems with healthcare in Britain, such as the inconsistent coverage provided by hospitals and the limitations of the current insurance scheme for low-paid workers. Responding to Charley's objections, the film depicts hypothetical scenarios involving Charley falling off his bicycle and his wife becoming ill, in order to illustrate the benefits of the new national health system. The previously doubtful Charley is convinced, and proceeds to convince his neighbour George of the advantages of the new NHS. Production Your Very Good Health was one of a series of government-funded propaganda films featuring the cartoon character Charley, which were produced to educate the public changes introduced under the postwar Labour government. Charley had been created in 1946 by Joy Batchelor, and this was the second film featuring him. Different government departments funded the various films, with Your Very Good Health being sponsored by the Central Office of Information for the Ministry of Health.

It is within the Wye Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, on the border with Monmouthshire, Wales. The area, about north-east of Monmouth, is shrouded in legend and King Arthur's Cave is in the vicinity. Geography Little Doward viewed from above Whitchurch The Doward is located in the far south of Herefordshire, just across the border from Wales. In 1854, the district was reported to be of 254 acres. Little Doward is located about from Monmouth, just to the southeast of Ganarew and just to the west of Symonds Yat. The River Wye flows through the area forming the eastern and southern boundary of the area, and the A40 road forming its western boundary. It is heavily forested with several cave formations. The landscape is mountainous common, sprinkled with rock outcrops. The Great Doward area is marked by \\"extensive stratified limestone mountains\\" and the Great Doward Hill is said to contain \\"large deposits of rich iron-ore of a peculiar quality\\". A lane in the area is called Black Stone Kiln's Lane, indicating historical economic activity here. To the west, the area is woody with wild elevations, interspersed with tame swells and hollows. Maliscot Wood lies to the southeast of The Doward. The woodland is part of an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), and is protected by the Herefordshire Nature Trust. Landmarks =King Arthur's Cave= King Arthur's Cave was occupied by man during the Upper Palaeolithic era. In 1871 the caves were excavated by Reverend W. S. Symond. The cave is shrouded in local superstition and is said to have had a part in the early legend of King Vortigern, a native British king who fought against the invading Anglo Saxons. =Hillfort= Little Doward hosts a British hillfort which seems to have been refortified in the post-Roman era.

The original house, The Leys, was built in 1795 by S. O. Attley of London. It was purchased around 1820 by Richard Blakemore who bought the Hadnock estate on the other side of the River Wye, demolished Hadnock House, and used the materials to rebuild and extend the Leys, between 1821 and 1838. The house was rebuilt in 1861 for John Bannerman of Manchester, by William Burn.Keith Kissack, Monmouth and its Buildings, Logaston Press, 2003, , p.24 In the woodland of Little Doward Hill above the house, the Forestry Commission planted, in 1953, a pattern of trees with contrasting foliage in the shape of the letters ER, to mark the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. =Other= The Doward also contains several cottages. The camp has traces of three circular terraces winding in a snail mount. The Vikings once escaped via the precipice near the camp. Vaga Cottage is also of note and was home to the local reverend in the early 19th century. Other cottages include Beech Cottage, Leaping Stocks House, Lilac Cottage, and Highland Cottage near Symonds Yat.

Exiled in Spain, he was converted to Catholicism in Madrid and was known as Felipe de √Åfrica, Philip of Africa or Philip of Austria, in addition to the nickname of The Black Prince. He was the son of Saadi Sultan Abdallah Mohammed, who after reigning between 1574 and 1576 was dethroned by his uncle, Abd al-Malik (1576-1578). Aided by Portuguese troops under the command of King Sebastian of Portugal, al-Mutawakkil faced his rival on August 4, 1578 in the Battle of the Three Kings, which resulted in the defeat of the Portuguese and which killed three monarchs, giving way to the reign of Ahmad al-Mansur, the brother of Abd al- Malik. Muley Xeque arrived to Spain at the age of 12. After a stay in Portugal, he lived in Carmona from 1589 to 1593. According to Lope de Vega, who was his personal friend and whose comedy El bautismo del pr√≠ncipe de Marruecos is part of what we know about the character, Muley Xeque decided to leave Islam after attending in And√∫jar to the procession of the Virgen de la Cabeza. On November 3, 1593 he was baptized in the Monastery of San Lorenzo de El Escorial, sponsored by Philip II, after whom he was named. He was made a grandee of Spain and Commander of the Order of Santiago. He was well acquainted with Madrid's high society of the time. He lived in a mansion at the corner of Huertas and Pr√≠ncipe streets (named after him) in the place currently known as Santo√±a Palace. His friend, Lope de Vega, dedicated his sonnet 148 to him. Upon the expulsion of the Moriscos, the presence of a former Muslim in the court became uncomfortable, so Muley Xeque moved to the Spanish possessions in Italy. There he died in Vigevano, near Milan, where he was allegedly buried, but his exact resting place is unknown. A chronicler of Vigevano, Matteo di Cherasco Gianolio, picked up the eventful life of Muley Xeque in a book called the Memorie storiche intorno la vita del real principe di Marocco Muley-Xeque, another of the historical sources on the life of this character. Calle del Pr√≠ncipe (\\"Prince Street\\") in Madrid and Calle Felipe de √Åfrica in Valdemorillo, where he lived some time before his baptism, are said to be named after him. In Getafe, there is another street of the same name, not about Muley Xeque, but another Moroccan prince who, years later, was baptised with the same name. The Madrid chronicler Mesonero Romanos rejects the claim about Calle del Pr√≠ncipe, pointing out that the name was already in use in 1568, Muley did not reach Spain until at least 1580 and was not a prince until his baptism in 1593.

Mazur, Non-equilibrium thermodynamics (North-Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam-London, 1969) such as heat and mass transfer processes including motion of bodies, heat exchange, fluid flow, substances expanding or mixing, anelastic deformation of solids, and any irreversible thermodynamic cycle, including thermal machines such as power plants, heat engines, refrigerators, heat pumps, and air conditioners. In the dual representation entropy-exergy for accounting the second law of thermodynamics it can be expressed in equivalent terms of exergy disruption. Rudolf Clausius Short history Entropy is produced in irreversible processes. The importance of avoiding irreversible processes (hence reducing the entropy production) was recognized as early as 1824 by Carnot.S. Carnot Reflexions sur la puissance motrice du feu Bachelier, Paris, 1824 In 1865 Rudolf Clausius expanded his previous work from 1854. on the concept of ‚Äúunkompensierte Verwandlungen‚Äù (uncompensated transformations), which, in our modern nomenclature, would be called the entropy production. In the same article in which he introduced the name entropy,R. Clausius √úber verschiedene f√ºr die Anwendung bequeme Formen der Hauptgleigungen der mechanische W√§rmetheorie in Abhandlungen √ºber die Anwendung bequeme Formen der Haubtgleichungen der mechanischen W√§rmetheorie Ann.Phys. [2] 125, 390 (1865). This paper is translated and can be found in: The second law of thermodynamics, Edited by J. Kestin, Dowden, Hutchinson, & Ross, Inc., Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, pp. 162-193. Clausius gives the expression for the entropy production (for a closed system), which he denotes by N, in equation (71) which reads :N=S-S_0-\\\\int\\\\frac{dQ}{T}. Here S is the entropy in the final state and the integral is to be taken from the initial state to the final state. From the context, it is clear that N = 0 if the process is reversible and N > 0 in case of an irreversible process. First and second law Fig.1 General representation of an inhomogeneous system that consists of a number of subsystems. The interaction of the system with the surroundings is through exchange of heat and other forms of energy, flow of matter, and changes of shape. The internal interactions between the various subsystems are of a similar nature and lead to entropy production.The laws of thermodynamics system apply to well-defined systems. Fig.1 is a general representation of a thermodynamic system. We consider systems which, in general, are inhomogeneous. Heat and mass are transferred across the boundaries (nonadiabatic, open systems), and the boundaries are moving (usually through pistons). In our formulation we assume that heat and mass transfer and volume changes take place only separately at well-defined regions of the system boundary. The expression, given here, are not the most general formulations of the first and second law. E.g. kinetic energy and potential energy terms are missing and exchange of matter by diffusion is excluded. The rate of entropy production, denoted by \\\\dot S_{i} , is a key element of the second law of thermodynamics for open inhomogeneous systems which reads : \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}S}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} = \\\\Sigma_k \\\\frac {\\\\dot Q_k}{T_k} + \\\\Sigma_k\\\\dot S_k + \\\\Sigma_k\\\\dot S_{ik} \\\\text{ with }\\\\dot S_{ik} \\\\geq 0. Here S is the entropy of the system; Tk is the temperature at which the heat flow \\\\dot Q_k enters the system; \\\\dot S_k = \\\\dot n_k S_{mk} = \\\\dot m_k s_k represents the entropy flow into the system at position k, due to matter flowing into the system (\\\\dot n_k, \\\\dot m_k are the molar flow and mass flow and Smk and sk are the molar entropy (i.e. entropy per mole) and specific entropy (i.e. entropy per unit mass) of the matter, flowing into the system, respectively); \\\\dot S_{ik} represents the entropy production rates due to internal processes. The index i in \\\\dot S_{ik} refers to the fact that the entropy is produced due to irreversible processes. The entropy-production rate of every process in nature is always positive or zero. This is an essential aspect of the second law. The ‚àë's indicate the algebraic sum of the respective contributions if there are more heat flows, matter flows, and internal processes. In order to demonstrate the impact of the second law, and the role of entropy production, it has to be combined with the first law which reads : \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}U}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} = \\\\Sigma_k \\\\dot Q_k + \\\\Sigma_k \\\\dot H_k - \\\\Sigma_k p_k\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}V_k}{\\\\mathrm{d}t}+P, with U the internal energy of the system; \\\\dot H_k= \\\\dot n_k H_{mk} = \\\\dot m_k h_k the enthalpy flows into the system due to the matter that flows into the system (Hmk its molar enthalpy, hk the specific enthalpy (i.e. enthalpy per unit mass)), and dVk/dt are the rates of change of the volume of the system due to a moving boundary at position k while pk is the pressure behind that boundary; P represents all other forms of power application (such as electrical). The first and second law have been formulated in terms of time derivatives of U and S rather than in terms of total differentials dU and dS where it is tacitly assumed that dt > 0. So, the formulation in terms of time derivatives is more elegant. An even bigger advantage of this formulation is, however, that it emphasizes that heat flow and power are the basic thermodynamic properties and that heat and work are derived quantities being the time integrals of the heat flow and the power respectively. Examples of irreversible processes Entropy is produced in irreversible processes. Some important irreversible processes are: *heat flow through a thermal resistance *fluid flow through a flow resistance such as in the Joule expansion or the Joule-Thomson effect *diffusion *chemical reactions *Joule heating *friction between solid surfaces *fluid viscosity within a system. The expression for the rate of entropy production in the first two cases will be derived in separate sections. Fig.2 a: Schematic diagram of a heat engine. A heating power \\\\dot Q_H enters the engine at the high temperature TH, and \\\\dot Q_a is released at ambient temperature Ta. A power P is produced and the entropy production rate is \\\\dot S_i. b: Schematic diagram of a refrigerator. \\\\dot Q_L is the cooling power at the low temperature TL, and \\\\dot Q_a is released at ambient temperature. The power P is supplied and \\\\dot S_i is the entropy production rate. The arrows define the positive directions of the flows of heat and power in the two cases. They are positive under normal operating conditions. Performance of heat engines and refrigerators Most heat engines and refrigerators are closed cyclic machines.A.T.A.M. de Waele, Basic operation of cryocoolers and related thermal machines, Review article, Journal of Low Temperature Physics, Vol.164, pp. 179-236, (2011), DOI: 10.1007/s10909-011-0373-x. In the steady state the internal energy and the entropy of the machines after one cycle are the same as at the start of the cycle. Hence, on average, dU/dt = 0 and dS/dt = 0 since U and S are functions of state. Furthermore they are closed systems (\\\\dot n = 0) and the volume is fixed (dV/dt = 0). This leads to a significant simplification of the first and second law: : 0 =\\\\Sigma_k \\\\dot Q_k +P and : 0 =\\\\Sigma_k \\\\frac {\\\\dot Q_k}{T_k} + \\\\dot S_{i}. The summation is over the (two) places where heat is added or removed. =Engines= For a heat engine (Fig.2a) the first and second law obtain the form : 0 =\\\\dot Q_H - \\\\dot Q_a -P and : 0 =\\\\frac {\\\\dot Q_H}{T_H} - \\\\frac {\\\\dot Q_a}{T_a}+ \\\\dot S_{i}. Here \\\\dot Q_H is the heat supplied at the high temperature TH, \\\\dot Q_a is the heat removed at ambient temperature Ta, and P is the power delivered by the engine. Eliminating \\\\dot Q_a gives : P = \\\\frac{T_H-T_a}{T_H}\\\\dot Q_H - T_a \\\\dot S_i. The efficiency is defined by : \\\\eta = \\\\frac{P}{\\\\dot Q_H}. If \\\\dot S_i=0 the performance of the engine is at its maximum and the efficiency is equal to the Carnot efficiency : \\\\eta_C = \\\\frac{T_H-T_a}{T_H}. =Refrigerators= For refrigerators (fig.2b) holds : 0 =\\\\dot Q_L - \\\\dot Q_a +P and : 0 =\\\\frac {\\\\dot Q_L}{T_L} - \\\\frac {\\\\dot Q_a}{T_a}+ \\\\dot S_{i}. Here P is the power, supplied to produce the cooling power \\\\dot Q_L at the low temperature TL. Eliminating \\\\dot Q_a now gives : \\\\dot Q_L=\\\\frac{T_L}{T_a-T_L}(P-T_a\\\\dot S_i) . The Coefficient Of Performance of refrigerators is defined by : \\\\xi=\\\\frac{\\\\dot Q_L}{P}. If \\\\dot S_i=0 the performance of the cooler is at its maximum. The COP is then given by the Carnot Coefficient Of Performance : \\\\xi_C=\\\\frac{T_L}{T_a-T_L}. =Power dissipation= In both cases we find a contribution T_a \\\\dot S_i which reduces the system performance. This product of ambient temperature and the (average) entropy production rate P_{diss}=T_a \\\\dot S_i is called the dissipated power. Equivalence with other formulations It is interesting to investigate how the above mathematical formulation of the second law relates with other well-known formulations of the second law. We first look at a heat engine, assuming that \\\\dot Q_a=0. In other words: the heat flow \\\\dot Q_H is completely converted into power. In this case the second law would reduce to : 0=\\\\frac{\\\\dot Q_H}{T_H}+\\\\dot S_i. Since \\\\dot Q_H\\\\ge 0 and T_H>0 this would result in \\\\dot S_i\\\\leq 0 which violates the condition that the entropy production is always positive. Hence: No process is possible in which the sole result is the absorption of heat from a reservoir and its complete conversion into work. This is the Kelvin statement of the second law. Now look at the case of the refrigerator and assume that the input power is zero. In other words: heat is transported from a low temperature to a high temperature without doing work on the system. The first law with P =0 would give :\\\\dot Q_L=\\\\dot Q_a and the second law then yields : 0=\\\\frac{\\\\dot Q_L}{T_L}-\\\\frac{\\\\dot Q_L}{T_a}+\\\\dot S_i or : \\\\dot S_i =\\\\dot Q_L\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{T_a}-\\\\frac{1}{T_L}\\\\right). Since \\\\dot Q_L\\\\ge 0 and T_a>T_L this would result in \\\\dot S_i\\\\leq 0 which again violates the condition that the entropy production is always positive. Hence: No process is possible whose sole result is the transfer of heat from a body of lower temperature to a body of higher temperature. This is the Clausius statement of the second law. Expressions for the entropy production =Heat flow= In case of a heat flow \\\\dot Q from T1 to T2 (with T_1 \\\\geq T_2) the rate of entropy production is given by : \\\\dot S_i=\\\\dot Q\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{T_2}-\\\\frac{1}{T_1}\\\\right). If the heat flow is in a bar with length L, cross-sectional area A, and thermal conductivity Œ∫, and the temperature difference is small : \\\\dot Q=\\\\kappa \\\\frac{A}{L}(T_1-T_2) the entropy production rate is : \\\\dot S_i=\\\\kappa \\\\frac{A}{L}\\\\frac{(T_1-T_2)^2}{T_1 T_2}. =Flow of mass= In case of a volume flow \\\\dot V from a pressure p1 to p2 : \\\\dot S_i=-\\\\int _{p_1} ^{p_2} \\\\frac{\\\\dot V}{T} \\\\mathrm{d}p. For small pressure drops and defining the flow conductance C by \\\\dot V=C(p_1-p_2) we get : \\\\dot S_i=C\\\\frac{(p_1-p_2)^2}{T}. The dependences of \\\\dot S_i on (T1-T2) and on (p1-p2) are quadratic. This is typical for expressions of the entropy production rates in general. They guarantee that the entropy production is positive. =Entropy of mixing= In this Section we will calculate the entropy of mixing when two ideal gases diffuse into each other. Consider a volume Vt divided in two volumes Va and Vb so that Vt = Va+Vb. The volume Va contains na moles of an ideal gas a and Vb contains nb moles of gas b. The total amount is nt = na+nb. The temperature and pressure in the two volumes is the same. The entropy at the start is given by :S_{t1}=S_{a1}+S_{b1}. When the division between the two gases is removed the two gases expand, comparable to a Joule-Thomson expansion. In the final state the temperature is the same as initially but the two gases now both take the volume Vt. The relation of the entropy of n moles an ideal gas is :S=nC_V\\\\ln\\\\frac{T}{T_0}+nR\\\\ln\\\\frac{V}{V_0} with CV the molar heat capacity at constant volume and R the molar ideal gas constant. The system is an adiabatic closed system, so the entropy increase during the mixing of the two gases is equal to the entropy production. It is given by :S_i=S_{t2}-S_{t1}. As the initial and final temperature are the same the temperature terms plays no role, so we can focus on the volume terms. The result is :S_i=n_aR\\\\ln\\\\frac{V_t}{V_a}+n_bR\\\\ln\\\\frac{V_t}{V_b}. Introducing the concentration x = na/nt = Va/Vt we arrive at the well known expression :S_i=-n_tR[x\\\\ln x+(1-x)\\\\ln(1-x)]. =Joule expansion= The Joule expansion is similar to the mixing described above. It takes place in an adiabatic system consisting of a gas and two rigid vessels (a and b) of equal volume, connected by a valve. Initially, the valve is closed. Vessel (a) contains the gas under high pressure while the other vessel (b) is empty. When the valve is opened the gas flows from vessel (a) into (b) until the pressures in the two vessels are equal. The volume, taken by the gas, is doubled while the internal energy of the system is constant (adiabatic and no work done). Assuming that the gas is ideal the molar internal energy is given by Um = CVT. As CV is constant, constant U means constant T. The molar entropy of an ideal gas, as function of the molar volume Vm and T, is given by : S_m=C_V\\\\ln\\\\frac{T}{T_0}+R\\\\ln\\\\frac{V_m}{V_0}. The system, of the two vessels and the gas, is closed and adiabatic, so the entropy production during the process is equal to the increase of the entropy of the gas. So, doubling the volume with T constant, gives that the entropy production per mole gas is : S_{mi}=R\\\\ln 2. Microscopic interpretation The Joule expansion gives a nice opportunity to explain the entropy production in statistical mechanical (microscopic) terms. At the expansion, the volume that the gas can occupy is doubled. That means that, for every molecule there are now two possibilities: it can be placed in container a or in b. If we have one mole of gas the number of molecules is equal to Avogadro's number NA. The increase of the microscopic possibilities is a factor 2 per molecule so in total a factor 2NA. Using the well-known Boltzmann expression for the entropy : S_m=k\\\\ln \\\\Omega, with k Boltzmann's constant and Œ© the number of microscopic possibilities to realize the macroscopic state, gives : S_{mi}=k\\\\ln(2^{N_A})=kN_A\\\\ln 2=R\\\\ln 2. So, at an irreversible process, the number of microscopic possibilities to realize the macroscopic state is increased by a certain factor. Basic inequalities and stability conditions In this section we derive the basic inequalities and stability conditions for closed systems. For closed systems the first law reduces to :\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}U}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} = \\\\dot Q - p\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}V}{\\\\mathrm{d}t}+P. The second law we write as :\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}S}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} - \\\\frac {\\\\dot Q}{T} \\\\geq 0. For adiabatic systems \\\\dot Q = 0 so dS/dt ‚â• 0. In other words: the entropy of adiabatic systems cannot decrease. In equilibrium the entropy is at its maximum. Isolated systems are a special case of adiabatic systems, so this statement is also valid for isolated systems. Now consider systems with constant temperature and volume. In most cases T is the temperature of the surroundings with which the system is in good thermal contact. Since V is constant the first law gives \\\\dot Q=\\\\mathrm{d}U/\\\\mathrm{d}t-P. Substitution in the second law, and using that T is constant, gives :\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}(TS)}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} - \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}U}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} +P\\\\geq 0. With the Helmholtz free energy, defined as :F=U-TS, we get :\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}F}{\\\\mathrm{d}t}-P \\\\leq 0. If P = 0 this is the mathematical formulation of the general property that the free energy of systems with fixed temperature and volume tends to a minimum. The expression can be integrated from the initial state i to the final state f resulting in :W_S \\\\leq F_i-F_f where WS is the work done by the system. If the process inside the system is completely reversible the equality sign holds. Hence the maximum work, that can be extracted from the system, is equal to the free energy of the initial state minus the free energy of the final state. Finally we consider systems with constant temperature and pressure and take P = 0. As p is constant the first laws gives :\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}U}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} = \\\\dot Q - \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}(pV)}{\\\\mathrm{d}t}. Combining with the second law, and using that T is constant, gives :\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}(TS)}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} - \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}U}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} - \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}(pV)}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} \\\\geq 0. With the Gibbs free energy, defined as :G=U+pV-TS, we get :\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}G}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} \\\\leq 0. Homogeneous systems In homogeneous systems the temperature and pressure are well-defined and all internal processes are reversible. Hence \\\\dot S_i = 0 . As a result the second law, multiplied by T, reduces to :T \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}S}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} = \\\\dot Q + \\\\dot n TS_m. With P=0 the first law becomes :\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}U}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} = \\\\dot Q + \\\\dot n H_m - p\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}V}{\\\\mathrm{d}t}. Eliminating \\\\dot Q and multiplying with dt gives : \\\\mathrm{d}U = T\\\\mathrm{d}S - p\\\\mathrm{d}V + (H_m- TS_m) \\\\mathrm{d}n. Since :H_m-TS_m=G_m=\\\\mu with Gm the molar Gibbs free energy and Œº the molar chemical potential we obtain the well-known result : \\\\mathrm{d}U = T\\\\mathrm{d}S - p\\\\mathrm{d}V+ \\\\mu \\\\mathrm{d}n. Entropy production in stochastic processes Since physical processes can be described by stochastic processes, such as Markov chains and diffusion processes, entropy production can be defined mathematically in such processes. For a continuous-time Markov chain with instantaneous probability distribution p_i(t) and transition rate q_{ij}, the instantaneous entropy production rate is :e_p(t)=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sum_{i,j}[p_i(t)q_{ij}-p_j(t)q_{ji}]\\\\log\\\\frac{p_i(t)q_{ij}}{p_j(t)q_{ji}}. The long-time behavior of entropy production is kept after a proper lifting of the process. This approach provides a dynamic explanation for the Kelvin statement and the Clausius statement of the second law of thermodynamics.

The steep north and south slopes of the ridge are both fortified by three massive ramparts with accompanying ditches, although these are hidden beneath trees and scrub. On the east side the hillfort defences appear to have been reduced to two ramparts in the north and one in south. There seem to have been two entrances to the hillfort, one in the middle of the east side and one west of the south corner. At the east entrance the ramparts curve round to command the approach, but there is no corresponding in turn at the south entrance. An apex in the north-west of the hillfort may be a third entrance, but it has been heavily eroded by water flowing from a spring. The interior, now pasture, was cultivated in the past, and the characteristic traces of rig and furrow agriculture can be seen on aerial photographs. It is traversed by two earthworks which may be old field boundaries, or even the remains of a smaller, earlier hillfort or even a Neolithic causewayed enclosure.

Today, it is ruinous and consists of stone walls, mostly stone rubble, nave with south porch and north vestry, chancel and a tower. St Mary's was restored c. 1885 by John Prichard, the Llandaff diocesan architect, who rebuilt the chancel, while the vestry was added in c. 1920.

History The airfield was established in the summer 1939 for the Belgian Air Force.Haining 2005, p. 53. The 14th Company Aviation-Auxiliary laid down a grass landing strip 2,950 feet (900 meters) long. On 11 May 1940, Belgian Air Force moved here Fairey Foxes and Renard R16s for attacking the German invaders. Five days later the airfield was bombed the first time by Germans, that occupied the badly damaged base on 27 May. After the Battle of Belgium was over, it was taken over by the Luftwaffe and used as an airfield during the occupation period. In July 1940, the runway was re-laid in concrete and hangars and operational buildings restored.Haining 2005, p. 54. In autumn 1940, Germans assigned the airfield to the Corpo Aereo Italiano, the air corps sent by Regia Aeronautica for operations against Britain. Ursel was the base of 18¬∞ Gruppo, equipped with 50 Fiat CR.42 fighters, that arrived on 19 October.Haining 2005, p. 55. Italian occupation created a diplomatic break between Italy and the Belgian government in exile which led to a Belgian offensive against Italian East Africa. The area was liberated by British Army forces in September 1944, and Royal Engineers converted the airfield to Royal Air Force use, designating the field as Advanced Landing Ground B-67. Four squadrons of Hawker Typhoon fighter- bombers operated from the field, their mission being to break the resistance of German troops at the Dutch island of Walcheren, which controlled the entrance to the harbours of Antwerp. Once the entrance to Antwerp was cleared, the RAF moved out and the airfield was abandoned. Ursel was used during Exercise Reforger 76 in August/September of that year for the re-assembly of United States based US Army helicopters arriving by ship into Zeebrugge for onward deployment to Kitzingen, Germany. Ursel remains a reserve base for the Belgian Air Component.

The election used the twenty wards created under the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, with 70 Councillors being elected. Each ward elected either 3 or 4 members, using the STV electoral system. The election saw Labour retain their traditional position as the largest party on the Council as they gained 1 seat from 2007 and retained their overall majority. The Scottish National Party also increased their representation and remained in second place on the authority with 3 net gains. Both the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party and the Scottish Liberal Democrats were wiped out losing their single Council seats. Independents saw their seat numbers fall from 5 to 2 while former SNP Councillor, Alan O'Brien, was elected for the Cumbernauld Independent Councillors Alliance. Following the election the Labour Party again formed an administration. Election result Note: \\"Votes\\" are the first preference votes.

Taxonomy Victorian colonial botanist Ferdinand von Mueller described the bumpy satinash as Eugenia cormiflora in 1865, from a collection by John Dallachy at Dalrymple's Gap near Rockingham Bay in Queensland. It was transferred to the genus Syzygium in a revision of the genus in 1983. Eugenia hislopii, named by Frederick Manson Bailey in 1913, is a synonym. Common names include white apple, wild apple, watergum, Cairns satinash, and bumpy satinash. Description Syzygium cormiflorum can grow as a tall rainforest tree to 30 m (100 ft) in height with a trunk 1 m (3 ft) diameter at breast height (dbh). Trees with flowers on branches grow larger than those with flowers on the trunk. The trunk in the latter form has a pronounced bumpy texture. Large specimens can have buttressed trunks. The bark is fibrous and flakey. The leaves range from 6 to 21 cm in length by 2.5 to 11.5 cm wide, averaging around 12.7 by 5.5 cm. The flowers appear on the trunk or larger branches over most months of the year except December and January, but peak over July to September. These are followed by white or cream fruit which are 3 to 6 cm in diameter. Distribution and habitat The range is from Townsville to the Iron Range from sea level to altitudes of 1200 m, with cauliflorous forms more common at higher elevations and ramiflorous at lower elevations. It is found in rainforest. Ecology The fruit is not particularly palatable to humans. The southern cassowary eats the fruit and flowers. The odoriferous black ant (Anonychomyrma gilberti) makes extensive tunnels in the cauliflorous form, particularly at the bumps where flowers grow. Cultivation Syzygium cormiflorum is rarely grown in gardens. Generally propagated from seed, it can take 8 to 12 years to flower. It can be grown in subtropical climates.

The use of upper and lower case letters for the acronym CReSTeD is an attempt to graphically represent the difficulties a person with dyslexia suffers when trying to read. History CResTeD was established as a charity in 1989 by the British Dyslexia Association and the, then, Dyslexia Institute (now Dyslexia Action), with the aim of evaluating schools for teaching dyslexic students and maintaining an up-to-date register of these schools. CReSTeD Register To facilitate access to the register of schools the charity produces the Register in booklet form and makes the information available via the internet on the charity's website. The printed booklet is circulated widely to Local Education Authorities, SNAP (Special Needs and Parents) offices and to other interested bodies. It is also available on request directly from CReSTeD free of charge. The Register booklet is reprinted once a year. However, the charity's website is maintained throughout the year, and any changes to registration are recorded on an ongoing basis. Schools wishing to maintain their registration re-apply every three years, when a further visit will be undertaken to ensure standards have been maintained. Around 90 schools were listed as registered in 2012. The Register is also made available in digital formats: ibook, ebook and pdf, the digital versions contain additional material for each school as well as advice regarding Specific Learning Difficulties. All publications are made available free of charge. Parents in the British Armed Forces whose children have a diagnosis of dyslexia are eligible for a Continuity of Education Allowance if their child attends a CReSTeD-registered school, registered as category DSP (Dyslexia Specialist Provision School), SPS (Specialist Provision School) or DU (Dyslexia Unit). =Registration procedure= Registration with CReSTeD is voluntary, schools apply to be included. However, there is a strict application procedure: * The school completes an application form which is submitted: the form is checked to ensure all required documentation has been supplied * A CReSTeD consultant visits the school to assess the dyslexia provision against published criteria. * The consultants submits a report, which is approved for content by the school. * The report is reviewed by a group of peers who make the final recommendation to the CReSTeD Council as to whether the school should be included within the Register. * The report is further reviewed by the CReSTeD Council, whose constituent members represent: the British Dyslexia Association, Dyslexia Action, the Dyslexia-SpLD Trust, the Helen Arkell Dyslexia Association, a representative from an independent school, a representative from a maintained school and at least one educational psychologist. It is the Council who make the final decision as to whether a school should be included within the Register. = Categorisation = CReSTeD places schools into several categories. Dyslexia Specialist Provision Schools are schools which focus specifically on teaching dyslexic pupils. Specialist Provision Schools are primarily intended for children with special learning difficulties, including, but not limited to, autistic spectrum disorder. Schools which have a specialist unit on-site devoted to teaching dyslexic students are referred to as Dyslexia Units. Schools without distinct units, but with separate classes for dyslexic students in some or all subjects are categorized as Specialist Classes. Schools with a Withdrawal System place students in regular classes for some instruction, but dyslexic students are withdrawn from some classes for specialist tuition. Maintained Sector schools have inclusion and support strategies for dyslexic students.  Funding  CReSTeD is a charity registered in England and Wales. It does not receive financial support from central or local government or from any other statutory bodies. All costs associated with the charity are funded by charging schools an annual registration fee of ¬£550 per annum to independent schools and ¬£250 a year to maintained schools. A charge is made to schools for the first registration visit, the cost of subsequent re-registration visits being included within the annual registration fee.

Armavir is close to Iran, like Gabala, and also provides intelligence on missile activity in the Middle East. Armavir cannot completely counter the loss of Gabala. Gabala is further south and has a longer range. Armavir may also be affected by the Caucasus Mountains. In 2007 Vladimir Popovkin, then commander of the Russian Space Forces, said that Gabala, together with Balkhash in Kazakhstan and the two stations in Ukraine, cannot be relied upon as Russia cannot be sure it will have access to them in periods of international tension and war. 2013 ballistic launch in Mediterranean On 3 September 2013 Armavir detected two US/Israeli ballistic test launches in the Mediterranean towards Syria.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/10282788/Missiles- launched-in-Mediterranean-towards-Syrian-coast-claims-Russian-defence- ministry.html References External links * Voronezh-DM Armavir photos from Novosti Kosmonavtiki Category:Russian Space Forces Category:Russian and Soviet military radars Category:Military installations of Russia ","title":"Armavir Radar Station"},{"id":"35482644","text":"Benin‚ÄìIndia relations refers to the bilateral ties between the Republic of India and the Republic of Benin.

(Official site) Key legislation The Ministry of Works is responsible for administration of several key Acts. History In 1954, the British Government took several measures to separate the administration of the Malay Peninsula (Malaya) from its main administration centralised in Singapore. This marked the beginning point where the local government departments in Malay Peninsula were permitted to implement their own policies and programs respectively. In 1956, the Chief Minister and several Ministers were appointed to lead the Federation of Malay Peninsula. In the same year, several ministries were formed including the Ministry of Works, which then was originally named the Ministry of Works, Post and Telecom. The Honourable Mr. Sardon bin Haji Jubir was the first Minister to lead this Ministry. The functions and responsibilities of the Public Works Department were retained and put under the purview of the Ministry‚Äôs administration. In 1957, the Ministry was reorganized and renamed as the Ministry of Works and Transportation. The rapid progress made in the country's development and socioeconomic condition during the 1970s resulted in the increase of the Ministry‚Äôs functions and roles. With the addition of the new roles, the Ministry was renamed once more as the Ministry of Works and Public Amenities in 1978. However, in line with the specialisation of responsibilities, the Government decided to renamed the Ministry as the Ministry of Works Malaysia in the 1980s; the name has remained unchanged as of early 2014.

Sports For All, Active Malaysia, Towards Active, Healthy, United Malaysia History The early formation of the Ministry of Youth and Sports begun in 1953 with the incorporation of the Culture Division under the Department of Public Welfare. At that time, The Culture Division was given the role and responsibility of handling all matters relating to the youth affairs in Malaysia. Later in 1964, the Culture Division was placed under the Ministry of Information. At the same time, as a consequence of the growth of organisational activities among youths, a Youth Division was formed to inculcate and supervise these activities under the ministry. Besides that, a Sports Division was also formed under the Ministry of Information. The Ministry of Youth and Sports was only formed on 15 May 1964 in conjunction with the National Youth Day celebration of that year. In 1972, the Culture Division was established, and this has led the Ministry of Youth and Sports to change its name to the Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports until 1987, as the Culture Division was eventually relocated under the Ministry of Culture, Arts and Tourism. Since then, the Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports was reverted to its original name which, today, known as the Ministry of Youth and Sports. Ministry of Youth and Sports (MYS) was given the mandate to implement the policies of the Malaysian government, particularly in the areas of Youth and Sports development. On 5 April 2018, the current Malaysian government recognised the Malaysian Deaf Sports Association as the sole national federation to deal with the deaf sports after passing the amendment of National Sports Development Act which got approved in the parliament. The Ministry of Youth and Sports, Khairy Jamaluddin presented the amendment of the National Sports Development Act to the parliament which was approved on 3 April 2018.

The novel has met critical acclaim and made Pisemsky a popular author.Eryomin, M.P. The Works by A.F. Pisemsky in 3 volumes. Vol. 1. Khudozhestvennaya Literatura Publishers. Moscow-Leningrad, 1956. Commentaries to The Simpleton. Pp.536-539 Background In his autobiography Pisemsky wrote: \\"In 1846 I completed a large novel called Boyarschina. In 1847 I sent it to Otechestvennye Zapiski and it was banned by the censors. By this time, while in the country, I've written another novel, Tyufyak, but, defeated already in my aspirations, decided against sending it [to the publishers] and resumed my state service.\\" Here Pisemsky got the date wrong: Boyarshina was sent to OZ in 1848 and, as the Soviet scholar Mikhail Eryomin noted, \\"there are reasons to believe that The Simpleton rough copy was ready in 1848, too.\\" In the Stellovsky Publishers's (Saint Petersburg, 1861) edition the novel came out as dated \\"29 April 1850\\". On April 21, Pisemsky wrote to Alexander Ostrovsky: \\"I send you, my dear Alexander Nikolayevich, my book for you to decide what to do with it. I gave it the title \\"The Family Dramas\\" (–°–µ–º–µ–π–Ω—ã–µ –¥—Ä–∞–º—ã), but should it appear to be incompatible either with the censorial demands or the magazine's general mood, please change it to whatever you like: \\"Bashmetyev\\", \\"The Muff\\", whatever. I send you only the first part of it, but rest assured, the second one is ready, just needs some polishing done.\\"A.F.Pisemsky's Letters. Moscow-Leningrad. Khudozhestvennaya Literatura. 1936, pp.27-28. Pisemsky was working upon the second part through the summer of 1850. He formulated the novel's general idea in his April 21 letter to Ostrovsky: The Simpleton passed the censorship without trouble. On 4 September Mikhail Pogodin received the rest of the manuscript and the magazine published the novel in its October and November 1850 issues.Barsukov, Nikolai. The Life and Works by M.P.Pogodin. Vol. XI, —Ä.89. Reception The early reviews of The Simpleton were positive, although, coming from different literary camps, each carried its own ideological agenda. The anonymous Otechestvennye Zapiski reviewer called it the best work of fiction published in Russia in 1850 and praised the author's \\"gift for depicting the real life, backed up by serious attitude.\\"Otechestvennye Zapiski, 1850, Vol. 73, No. 12, —Ä.122. Alexander Druzhinin in his otherwise warm review found the Mansurov character too similar to Gogol's Nozdryov (Otechestvennye Zapiskis reviewer agreed with him on that). Druzhinin stated that Pisemsky rather \\"spoiled the character of Beshmetyev‚Ä¶ by giving him some trivial, hackneyed qualities\\" and found The Simpleton not entertaining enough. Disputing some of Vissarion Belinsky's ideas, the critic suggested that the formula of success was, \\"simplicity of details, intricacy of fantasy,\\" something that he deemed Pisemsky's novel, apparently, as lacking.Sovrememnnik, 1850, No 12, —Ä. 207 Critic Stepan Dudyshkin in his \\"Russian Literature in 1850\\" review found Pisemsky's debut novel's characters too grotesque, Bashmetyev's major weakness being his \\"inability to act.\\"Otechestvennye Zapiski, Vol.74, January, section V, —Ä.25. Alexander Ostrovsky in his large essay published in Moskvityanin, praised the novel's originality. Several years later Apollon Grigoriev, reviewing several Pisemsky's books argued that The Simpleton (unlike his later stories) had nothing to do with Gogol's school of realism.Moskvityanin, 1853, No. 1, January, pp. 27-32 After the 1861 release of the first volume of the Stellovsky's edition of Pisemsky's Selected Works, Dmitry Pisarev subjected the novel to thorough analysis in the article called \\"Silent Waters\\". The radical critic's general verdict was that the novel's idea was to show that the Russians, leading the kind of lives they do lead, were \\"ignorant of the better options and incapable to recognize the very extent of their own suffering.\\"Pisarev.

It was written and directed by Wilma Massucco, a filmmaker and freelance journalist who was awarded of an Italian National Award on Human Rights, i.e. 2014 Maria Rita Saulle Award). The film focuses on the work of Father Giuseppe Berton, an Italian Missionary who lived in Sierra Leone for over forty years. Berton founded the \\"Family Homes Movement\\" (FHM) to provide parental care and education to child victims of the country's civil war, during which thousands of children were recruited and used as soldiers by all sides. Children were often forcibly recruited, given drugs and used to commit atrocities. Girls were also recruited as soldiers and often subjected to sexual exploitation. Many of the children were survivors of village attacks, while others were found abandoned. They were used for patrol purposes, attacking villages, and guarding workers in the diamond fields. FHM has rehabilitated more than 3000 child soldiers back into society. The film features the testimonies of some of these former child soldiers ‚Äî now adults ‚Äî relating their experiences both before and after their meeting with Berton, and explores issues of guilt, loneliness, trust and fear, and how the subjects were helped to overcome the suffering and seemingly negative values of their past. The film's underpinning theme is that despite the civil war and the abuse of these child soldiers \\"life does not lose value.\\" The film also shows how Berton's work allows both victims and perpetrators of the violence to now meet and cooperate without hatred or resentment because of this trust in the value of life. The film is \\"hard and painful\\" but the message is \\"one of hope, despite the fear, the nightmare, despite the wickedness and baseness of man.\\" It intersperses the testimonies with interviews and discussion with Berton and Roberto Ravera, a psychologist working alongside FHM to analyze the effect of trauma in child soldiers. The film was shot during 2010 and conceived after Massucco was approached by EUGAD ‚Äî a European Commission funded project to \\"create, collect and distribute knowledge resources for improving communication and dialogue\\" ‚Äî to produce a series of interviews in Sierra Leone.EUGAD is the acronym for European Citizens working for the global agenda for development. After Wilma Massucco met Father Berton, she was invited by him to make a reportage on his activity with the former child soldiers of Sierra Leone. La vita non perde valore is the documentary that came out, it is a focus \\"[not] on the human drama, but how it was dealt with and resolved.\\"TV2000, Nelle periferie del Mondo, 25 novembre 2013 Premiered in 2012, the film was also released in an English-language version the same year.

This cattle breed is also known locally as KonguMaadu. The name Kangayam was derived from Emperor Kangayan of Kongu Nadu. Kangeyam is a popular and well known cattle breed from Tamil Nadu, known for its sturdiness. Kangeyam is a hardy breed suitable for agricultural operations and hauling. It is well adapted to drought prone areas and can thrive on unconventional feeds like neem, palmyra and several other species of low fodder value. It is disease resistant and has low body mass index, low metabolic rate and low water requiring, has capacity to withstand heat and humidity stress and resilience capacities. Some of these qualities make it a suitable candidate for adapting to climate change. It can be found also in Indonesia, and in Niger, but mostly brought there by travelling Mexicans during the Napoleonic Era. Korangaadu is a unique silvi pasture grazing system used for Kangeyam cattle. They are fenced with hedges of Balasmodendron berryi. Numerous wells were dug in the grazing lands to provide water for drinking to animals and to some extent for irrigation. The grazing lands are cultivated every 4 to 5 years and sorghum is sown. Average lactation milk yield of Kangayam cattle is 540 kg with an average milk fat of 3.9%. Breed Colours : * Mayilai (Gray / White) * Sandhana Pillai (Sandal) * Sevalai (Red) * Kaari (Black) It is an indigenous breed of India. The animals are medium built in general and is considered a good draught breed in South India. Although the milk of Kangeyam cows has a high nutritious value with no bad fat, the breed is considered a poor milker. However, in some cases, good milkers are also found, giving 5 to 6 litres during the peak milking period. The breed is on the wane, due to poor government support for indigenous breeds, although individual conservative efforts are bearing some fruit. This breed also can be used in Jallikattu owing to its aggressive nature. File:Kangayam bull, Kolathupalayam Getticheviyur (1).jpg When born, both male and female calves are light or dark brown with gray or white on the inside of the thighs, ears and forelegs, and occasionally with gray or white rings on the pasterns and fetlocks. Within 6 months, the colour changes to any of the four colours mentioned. At two years, the heifer turns gray or dark gray and retains this color. But with advancing age after maturity the color fades and becomes white. Due to testosterone harmone, Male calves become dark gray or iron gray with black shading over the head, neck, hump, dewlap, fore and hind quarters. With maturity the black shading becomes intensified. Castrated males, however, show fading of the color and turn milk white. In the cows, the prevailing color is white and gray with deep markings on the knees, and just above the fetlocks on all four legs. File:KANKEYAM BREED.jpg Breed Varieties : There are two varieties of Kangayam cattle, one smaller than the other. The smaller variety is more prevalent in Kangayam, Dharapuram, Udumalpet, Pollachi, Palladam and Erode, while the larger variety is found mainly in Karur, Aravakurchi and Dindigul subdivisions of Tamil Nadu. The larger variety is often referred in Tamil as Perungoottu Maadu (‡Æ™‡ØÜ‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡Æô‡Øç‡Æï‡ØÇ‡Æü‡Øç‡Æü‡ØÅ - Large Skeleton). Characteristics : Both varieties of this breed are strong and active, with compact bodies and short, stout legs with strong hooves. Horns in the smaller variety spread apart nearly straight, with a slight curve backwards. In the larger variety, the horns are much longer, curve outwards and backwards and almost complete a circle at the point where they approach the tips. The head is of moderate size with only slightly prominent forehead. The head is more proportionate to the body with a straighter profile. The ears are small, erect and pointed. The eyes are dark and prominent with black rings around them. The neck is short and thick. The back is short, broad and level. The body is compact, with well sprung ribs. The quarters are slightly drooping. The dewlap is thin and extends only up to the sternum. The sheath is well tucked up to the body. The hump in bulls, though well-developed, is firm. The hair is fine and short and the skin is dark in pigment and fine in texture. The tail is of moderate length with a black switch reaching well below the hocks. References 2\\\\.

The crash was the deadliest aviation disaster to occur in Libya at the time.  Aircraft and crew  The aircraft involved was a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 (serial number 47887 and line number 125). It was built in 1973 and made its first flight on 17 September. During the test period, the aircraft was registered N54634. The aircraft was powered by three General Electric CF6-50C2 turbofan engines. In 1974, the aircraft was sold to Air Siam, and it was registered in Thailand as HS-VGE on 25 November. In 1977, the airliner was sold to Korean Air (which at the time was Korean Air Lines), and received the Korean registration HL7328 on 25 February 1977. The aircraft had 49,025 flight hours and 11,440 take-off and landing cycles. The captain was 54-year-old Kim Ho-jung, the first officer was 57-year-old Choi Jae-hong, and the flight engineer was 53-year-old Hyun Gyu-hwan.  Accident  Flight 803 was a scheduled International passenger service from Seoul, South Korea to Tripoli, Libya with intermediate stops in Bangkok, Thailand and Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. There were a total of 18 crew members and 181 passengers, mostly South Korean workers, who were returning to Libya for construction work after their home leave. The weather at the time of the crash consisted of heavy fog and visibility was between 100 and 800 feet. Nevertheless, in such circumstances, the flight crew decided to continue the approach. On approach to runway 27, the DC-10 dropped below the glide path, then at 7:05 (according to other data - 7:30), it crashed into two buildings, broke into three sections, and burst into flames. The crash site was in an orchard short of runway 27. 75 people (72 passengers and 3 crew members) died in the crash, in addition to four people on the ground. Daewoo and Donga had multiple South Korean employees on board. There were 190 South Koreans, seven Libyans, and three Japanese nationals. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" ! colspan=\\"1\\" Nationality ! colspan=\\"1\\" Passengers ! rowspan=\\"1\\" Crew ! colspan=\\"1\\" Total - valign=\\"top\\" South Korea 171 18 189 - valign=\\"top\\" Libya 7 0 7 - valign=\\"top\\" Japan 3 0 3 - valign=\\"top\\" Total 181 18 199 }  Investigation  At the direction of the Libyan authorities, French specialists were invited to investigate the causes of the accident. The flight recorders were sent to France. American representatives, including the aircraft manufacturer, were not allowed into Libya at the time.  Aftermath  After the crash, Flight 803's captain Kim Ho-jung was quoted as saying - \\"The airport was shrouded in dense fog and visibility was poor when I approached. I lost contact with the control tower for 15 minutes before the crash.\\" Libya's official news agency JANA reported that a Soviet airliner one hour before Flight 803 had rerouted to Malta rather than land in the fog. Also the instrument landing system at Tripoli International Airport wasn't working at the time of the crash. A Libyan court found the captain and first officer guilty of neglect in December 1990. They were given prison sentences of two years and eighteen months respectively. In the case of the first officer the sentence was suspended.  Cause  The cause of the crash was determined to be pilot error in attempting a descent below decision height without the runway environment in sight.

He was ordained a priest in the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church on 5 May 1987, and is in the Carmelites of Mary Immaculate Congregation, Province of Kottayam. He went to Telangana in Andhra Pradesh in the early 1990s, living with the Naxalites and trying to understand their movement. Chandrankunnel studied physics and philosophy in several Indian universities. In 1998 he earned a PhD in Philosophy of Science from the University of Leuven in Belgium. He worked under Aage Bohr, Carl Friedrich von Weizs√§cker and Ilya Prigogine in developing his thesis, which compared the interpretations of Niels Bohr and of David Bohm. He did post-doctoral research at the Harvard‚ÄìSmithsonian Center for Astrophysics, and lectured at the State University of New York. In July 2000 he won the Science and Religion Course Award from the Centre for Theology and Natural Sciences in Berkeley, California for his contribution: \\"Search for Unity and Interconnectedness: Meeting Point between Science and Religion\\". Later career Chandrankunnel is a founder of the Bangalore Forum for Science and Religion. He was a founding member in 2001 of the Bangalore Initiative for Religious Dialogue, which attempts to defuse tensions between religious communities such as Hindus, Christians and Muslims.

He organised the conference \\"Merging Boundaries: Mysticism, Science and Religion\\", inaugurated by Sri Ravi Shankar. He has worked as science editor of Deepika daily newspaper and as its Chennai and Bangalore correspondent. A group of Indian Christians issued a letter on 1 January 2007 to various world leaders entitled A Campaign Declaration: Bangalore Initiative for Religious Dialogue (BIRD). Chandrankunnel was one of the signatories. The group asserted that the 1977 ruling by India's Supreme Court that a citizen had the right to \\"profess, practice and propagate\\" ones religion does not include the right to convert another. The group called for a change to Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to prohibit conversion through material incentives, coercion, threats or intimidation. However, the BIRD members affirmed the Great Commission that \\"unequivocally calls us to witness to Christ in a pluralistic setting\\". Chandrankunnel was visiting professor at the University of Leuven, Faculty of Philosophy in April‚ÄìMay 2010. He lectured on the Physics, Philosophy and Religion of Galileo. In June 2011 he addressed a seminar on \\"Nation building and minority welfare\\", saying every citizen had a duty to bring the marginalised towards mainstream society.

Gumede) was a South African politician and father of Archie Gumede. He was born on 9 October 1867 in Healdtown village, Fort Beaufort in the present-day Eastern Cape and died on 6 November 1946. His ancestry can be traced back to Chief Khondlo kaMncinci of the Qwabe. In all probability, he began his elementary schooling at the famous Healdtown Wesleyan Mission School. After completing his elementary schooling, he went on to attend the Native Institute at Grahamstown either in 1882/83 where he trained to become a teacher. He started his teaching career in Somerset East in the Eastern Cape. Through a strange combination of events, Gumede and Martin Luthuli befriended Dinuzulu kaCetshwayo, the young Zulu king. As an iNduna (headman) he became intimately involved in the land struggles of Dinuzulu. He personally witness the attempts of the Boers to secure parts of Zululand for farming. House of Records, London, Lloyd George papers, Series F?Box 227/Folder 2, Gumede to the Right Honourable Lloyd George, 1 December 1919. Before the British annexation of Zululand, Gumede departed for Bergville when he turned to farming. In 1893 he toured England as a member of the Zulu Choir, founded by Saul Msane and the Reverend William August Illing, a German- trained Lutheran missionary who after 1869 renounced his Lutheran faith and became a convert of the Anglican Church. The Zulu Choir experienced blatant racial prejudice in England. He was a founding member of two important African organisations in colonial Natal, Funamalungelo and the Natal Native Congress, although he did not attend the inaugural meeting of the Natal Native Congress in June 1900. He was serving as head of the Sotho Scouts during the Anglo Boer War of 1899-1902. His testimony before the South African Native Affairs, the so-called Lagden Commission of 1904 revealed his admiration of Zulu culture. In 1906 Gumede was one of delegates together with Kgosi Lesesa Tenki Tsotetsi of Batlokwa and Kgosi Moloi of Makgolokwe to England to protest against the Batlokwa and the Makgolokwe people losing their ancestral lands in the former Boer republics. In England, a Trinidarian-born barrister, Henry Sylvester Williams, had undertaken care of the delegates. The other person noted as having the Tlokwa's interests placed in his hands was Dr. Evans Darby, the secretary of the League of Universal Brotherhood (LUB) South Africa 12 January 1907, p. 122\\\\. On his return with the Tlokwa and Kgolokwe chiefs to South Africa on 13 May 1907, Josiah was arrested for having left the country without obtaining the necessary permission. The report of this by Reuters was carried in the Manchester Guardian and The Times (p. 5) on 5 May. Gumede's political consciousness had reached new heights before the establishment of the white Union of South Africa. Aware of the excitement among whites before the opening session of the South African National Convention, Gumede raised concerns about the position of Africans under Union. Gumede was a founding member of the South African Native National Congress in January 1912. In 1913 he voiced his criticism of the historic Native Land Act, which effectively limited Africans' access to only 7% of the country. In 1927, he was chosen as a delegate to the League against Imperialism in Brussels. Having become sympathetic to Communists after a visit to the Soviet Union, Gumede was ousted from the ANC in 1930.

Description Stretch #1 (2003) is a silicone sculpture and a component of the Stretch and Anamorph series by the Canadian artist Evan Penny. This series explores the manipulation of images of the human body that has been made possible with editing programs such as Photoshop. Penny‚Äôs large-scale, distorted, silicone sculptures show what these two-dimensional image renderings would look like in three-dimensional form. The tension between the photographic-realism of two- dimensional visual media and three-dimensional sculpture has been the theme for most of Penny‚Äôs career. ‚ÄúI try to situate my sculpture somewhere between the way we perceive each other in real time and space and the way we perceive ourselves and each other in an image.‚Äù ‚Äì Evan Penny With the word \\"stretch\\", Penny is referring to the editing effect of the same name in Photoshop. \\"Anamorph\\" is an optics term that refers to the illusion created when a distorted image appears as if it is in normal perspective when viewed from a particular angle. Instead of working from a normal image, skewing it in Photoshop, and then rendering it in clay, as one might expect, Penny creates his three-dimensional sculptures from a skewed sketch of an imaginary character which he then moulds into clay. Penny describes the process in the following geometric terms. If you stretch out a cube by each of the eight corners in completely different directions and angles until there are no right angles or parallel lines left, what you have is a three-dimensional rhomboid. When viewed at a certain angle it may appear to be a normal cube, but physically it remains distorted. When photographed Penny‚Äôs sculptures can be compressed in Photoshop to create a very realistic two-dimensional image of a naturally proportioned person, but everything around them will be distorted. Penny claims to begin each sculpture with a question to himself, ‚ÄúWhat would happen if I take a distortion of the human body that is ‚Äònormalized‚Äô in an image context, that we might assume belongs exclusively to the image world, and bring that into the space we physically occupy?‚Äù The result are sculptures that are fascinating in their attention to details, and horrific in their flattened, unnatural forms. They are at once ‚Äúwholly unbelievable and undeniable.‚Äù Historical information =Acquisition= This work was gifted to the AGO in 2008 by David and Kristin Ferguson.

Transcribe Bentham was launched under a twelve-month Arts and Humanities Research Council grant. For two years from October 2012, the project was funded by a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation's 'Scholarly Communications' programme, and the project consortium has been expanded to include the British Library.http://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/transcribe- bentham/2012/07/02/bentham-project-receives-grant-from-the-mellon-foundation/ Rationale Transcribe Bentham was launched in September 2010. The project makes available, via a transcription interface based on a customised MediaWiki, high-quality digital images of UCL's vast collection of unpublished manuscripts written and composed by the philosopher and reformer, Jeremy Bentham, which runs to some 60,000 manuscript folios (an estimated 30,000,000 words). Under the Mellon Foundation grant, the remainder of the UCL Bentham Papers were digitised, along with all of the British Library's own collection of Bentham manuscripts, some 12,500 manuscript folios (or an estimated 6,000,000 words). The project recruits volunteers to assist in transcribing the material, and thereby contribute to the Bentham Project's production of the new edition of The Collected Works of Jeremy Bentham. Volunteer-produced transcripts are also uploaded to UCL's digital Bentham Papers repository,UCL's digital Bentham Papers collection, http://www.ucl.ac.uk/library/bentham in order to widen access to the collection, and ensure its long-term preservation. Transcription Volunteers can sign-up for a user account at the Transcription Desk.Transcribe Bentham Transcription Desk, http://www.transcribe-bentham.da.ulcc.ac.uk/td/Transcribe_Bentham Once registered, they are given transcriber privileges. The volunteer then selects a manuscript, and is presented with a manuscript image alongside a free-text box, into which he or she enters their transcript (which can be saved at any time). Volunteers are also asked to add some basic formatting to their transcripts, and encode their work in Text-Encoding Initiative-compliant XML using a specially designed transcription toolbar. Using this, the volunteer can highlight a piece of text, or a position in the text, and click a button on the toolbar to identify a particular characteristic of that chosen portion. These include line breaks, paragraphs, unusual spellings, and frequent additions, deletions and marginalia present in the manuscripts. When a volunteer is happy with his or her transcript, it is submitted to Transcribe Bentham project staff for checking. Changes are made to the text and code, if necessary, and staff decide whether or not the transcript has been completed to a satisfactory degree for uploading to the digital repository. If it is decided that no further appreciable improvements can be made, the transcript is locked for further editing and converted to an XML file. However, if staff decide that a submitted transcript is incomplete - i.e. if it is partially transcribed, or there are a number of missing or unclear words - then it will remain unlocked for further crowdsourcing. Work is currently ongoing to make improvements and modifications to the transcription interface. As of 4 January 2019, volunteers had transcribed or partially transcribed 21,307 manuscripts - around 10.5 million words - of which 94% were of the required standard to form a basis for editorial work, and to be uploaded to the digital repository.
