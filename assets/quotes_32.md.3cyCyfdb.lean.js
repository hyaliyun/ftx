The memorial was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and follows his design for the Cenotaph on Whitehall in London. Unveiled in 1924, it commemorates men of the Welch Regiment who fell in the First World War, and is today a grade II listed building. Background In the aftermath of the First World War and its unprecedented casualties, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain. Amongst the most prominent designers of memorials was the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, described by Historic England as \\"the leading English architect of his generation\\". Lutyens designed the Cenotaph on Whitehall in London, which became the focus for the national Remembrance Sunday commemorations, as well as the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing‚Äîthe largest British war memorial anywhere in the world‚Äîand the Stone of Remembrance which appears in all large Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries and in several of Lutyens' civic war memorials. The Welch Regiment is one of eight cenotaphs by Lutyens in Britain besides the one on Whitehall, one of three to serve as a memorial for a regiment (the other two being the Royal Berkshire Regiment War Memorial in Reading and the Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment Cenotaph in Maidstone), and the only one of his war memorials in Wales (the other eight are all in England). The squat design of the cenotaph is reminiscent of several memorials for individuals designed by Lutyens, including American actor James Keteltas Hackett and Australian businessman Sidney Myer.Skelton and Gliddon, p. 91. The Welch Regiment originally commissioned Lutyens to design a memorial to be sited near Gheluvelt on the Western Front in Belgium, where the regiment had been involved in fighting. The principle was approved by the Battlefield Exploits Committee in October 1922, but six months later Lutyens wrote to the War Office to inform them that the memorial would instead be erected outside Maindy Barracks, the regiment's headquarters, in Cardiff. History and design The memorial consists of a cenotaph in Portland stone which stands on a stepped plinth and a square base, all standing on a base of three shallow steps. Then north and south faces bear inscriptions in English and Welsh (respectively), while the east and west faces contain the regiment's role of honour from the First and Second World Wars (respectively). Inscriptions relating to the Second World War and the Korean War (1950‚Äì1953) were added later. The upper sections of the east and west faces bear carvings of a laurel wreath in high relief, while regimental cap badges are carved on the lower stages of each face. The memorial was unveiled on 11 November 1924 by Major-General Sir Thomas Marden, with the dedication carried out by the Reverend Ernest Thorold.

It was operated by the Reading Company; ownership was split between the Reading and its subsidiary the Philadelphia, Germantown and Norristown Railroad. It was a four-tracked main line beginning at the Reading Terminal, the Reading's terminus in Philadelphia, and extending north into the city to a junction with the Bethlehem Branch. After the final bankruptcy of the Reading the line passed to Conrail and later SEPTA. The portion south of the Temple University station was abandoned in 1984 with the opening of the Center City Commuter Connection and is now known as the Reading Viaduct; the portion north is now part of the SEPTA Main Line.  Route  The line originated at the Reading Terminal, an elevated railway station which opened in 1893. The City Branch, a freight-only route, diverged almost immediately. Four tracks continued north to the North 16th Street Junction with the Norristown Branch. At Wayne Junction the Chestnut Hill Branch diverged and the Ninth Street Branch narrowed to two tracks. At Newtown Junction, between Logan and Tabor, the New York Short Line (originally the Newtown Branch) diverged. At Tabor Junction, just beyond Tabor, the branch joined the Bethlehem Branch. Up until the final conveyance to Conrail in 1976 the Philadelphia, Germantown and Norristown owned the portion between North Broad Street and Tabor Junction, while the Reading Company owned the line south from North Broad Street to the Reading Terminal.  History  Silverliner II on the Ninth Street Branch in 1964 The first part of what came to be called the Ninth Street Branch was the Philadelphia, Germantown and Norristown Railroad's line between Philadelphia and Germantown, which opened on June 6, 1832. The Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, forerunner of the Reading Company, leased the PG&N; on December 1, 1870. The P&R;'s primary Philadelphia depot was then at Broad and Callowhill, but it began routing some trains to the PG&N;'s depot at Ninth and Green as well. The Reading leased the North Pennsylvania Railroad in 1879, adding the North Pennsylvania's substantial network of suburban Philadelphia lines and what became the New York Branch‚Äìthe North Penn's New York‚ÄìPhiladelphia line. Also in 1879 the Reading constructed the Tabor Branch from Wayne Junction, where the PG&N;'s original line continued toward Germantown, to the North Penn's Bethlehem Branch at Tabor Junction. This permitted the Reading to route New York-bound trains over the PG&N; as well. Finally, at the urging of the City of Philadelphia, the Reading consolidated its passenger options on the PG&N; route. The Reading constructed the Reading Terminal, a new elevated terminal at Twelfth and Market. An elevated line connected the terminal to the existing line at Ninth and Green. The extension opened on January 29, 1893. The line north of Ninth and Green remained at street level and its grade crossings saw numerous accidents. Again at the urging of the city, and after the route acquired the derisive sobriquet \\"Death Alley\\", the Reading elevated the entire branch. Work began on October 3, 1907 and was completed on January 1, 1911. During the late 1920s the Reading implemented a 12 kV 25 Hz overhead electrification on its Philadelphia commuter lines which originated from the Reading Terminal. Electric service began on July 26, 1931. = Partial closure = Abandoned railroad tracks of the Reading Viaduct The Reading Company and its subsidiaries were incorporated into Conrail; the Ninth Street Branch was designated to Conrail as part of the United States Railway Association's \\"Final System Plan\\". Under Conrail the branch remained as it had been under the Reading, but change was coming. Discussed for decades, the Center City Commuter Connection opened November 12, 1984. This tunnel, which diverged from the Ninth Street Branch south of Temple University, permitted trains on the Reading commuter lines to access the former Pennsylvania Railroad lines via Suburban Station. Reading Terminal and Spring Garden Street were closed. The former Ninth Street Branch between Temple University and Tabor Junction is now part of the SEPTA Main Line, while the abandoned elevated line is known as the Reading Viaduct.

The aim of the expedition was to capture the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets. The expedition was a huge military and financial success and virtually removed the Spanish and Portuguese from these waters.Clarke p 25 In addition the raid had large consequences in terms of English colonial expansion and settlement.McDermott p 156 Background War had already been declared by Philip II of Spain after the Treaty of Nonsuch in which Queen Elizabeth I had offered her support to the rebellious Protestant Dutch rebels. On 26 May the Spanish enforced an embargo on English shipping in Bilbao harbour, and then all over Spain. The armed merchant ship Primrose fought her way clear and brought the news to London.Konstam p. 61 English anger responded with the release of a large number of privateers in reprisal and took precautions against other merchant ships‚Äô being caught in Spain. The Queen through Francis Walsingham at the same time had also ordered Sir Francis Drake to lead an expedition to attack the Spanish New World in a kind of preemptive strike. Sir Humphrey Gilbert, provided with patent letters from the Queen had landed in St John's in August 1583, and formally took possession of Newfoundland for EnglandBrian Cuthbertson, \\"John Cabot and His Historians: Years of Controversy.\\" Journal of the Royal Nova Scotia Historical Society 1998 1: 16‚Äì35. See Samuel Eliot Morison, The European Discovery of America: The Northern Voyages (1971) Bernard Drake (distant kinsman of Sir Francis Drake), had become associated with Gilbert, through his relatives Richard Grenville and Walter Raleigh.Loker p 78 In 1585, Drake had joined with Raleigh and Gilbert‚Äôs brother, John, in activities connected with the Roanoke Island Colony, in present-day North Carolina. On 10 June Raleigh was authorized by the privy council to press ships for a voyage to be made to the Newfoundland fishing grounds. The expedition was to warn English fishing vessels there not to take fish direct to Spain or Portugal (trade being already well established), and to seize any vessels belonging to subjects of the king of Spain they could find. Commissions to lead such expeditions were issued to Carew Raleigh and to Bernard Drake on 20 June, and the latter was ordered about 27 June to launch an expedition against the Newfoundland fisheries.Holly p 59 They dropped plans for a privateering voyage to the West Indies en route for Roanoke, where a colony was to be settled by Sir Richard Grenville who had left Plymouth in April. Drake's sweep Drake left Plymouth for Newfoundland in July with a fleet of ten ships, including his flagship Golden Riall. Many of the ships were funded by investors hoping to receive a share of any plunder.Andrews p 192 The venture soon hit success with the capture of a large Portuguese ship laden with Brazilian sugar and other commodities. Bernard Drake Drake arrived off Newfoundland in early mid-August, and landed at Saint Johns, re-establishing England's claim on the country. St. Johns became a base for his operations, where his ships gathered supplies and fresh water.Chartrand p. 9 While there, he alerted the English fishermen to the danger of heading directly to markets in Spain and Portugal. Instead of heading home, many of them joined their ranks and Drake's ships soon increased in number to ten, many of them armed. As the English then established themselves they then intercepted, captured, plundered, and even burned many Spanish and Portuguese fishing ships. A few armed flyboats protecting them met the same fate. Small in number, they were no match for the heavily armed English ships and most either fled or were captured.Cell pp 47-48 As news spread of the raid, Spanish fishing ships then tended to frequent the island‚Äôs south coast, mainly on the Avalon peninsula, away from the English area of dominance. By the end of September, Drake had cleared this area of any Spanish and Portuguese ships and then sent some of his own ships back to England escorting the prizes. His force raided a Spanish whaling and fishing base on the Burin Peninsula, capturing or burning all the stores. Other smaller locations in Placentia Bay were destroyed too. Soon the lack of prizes in the region became more apparent and Drake met up and joined forces with another of Raleigh‚Äôs associates, George Raymond in the Red Lion, who had sailed with Grenville on the way to Roanoke.Bicheno p 180 Leaving Newfoundland, the force then headed to the Azores in the hope of seizing Spanish ships from the West Indies. More success followed with captures of ships with cargos of sugar, wine, and ivory, and a French ship carrying some gold. With disease starting to take its toll, Drake's ships headed home, but not before running into a storm that caused the loss of two prizes. In all they probably took more than twenty ships, though not all reached England safely; many of the prizes were sunk in storms, burned, or destroyed in battle. Aftermath The voyage was both successful and profitable, in addition the result of depriving the Spanish navy and merchant marine of 60,000 quintals or 3,000 tons of the dried fish so important to the victualling of ocean-going ships. In all 600 Spanish and Portuguese prisoners were taken and many were taken back to England to be interned in retaliation for the Spanish doing the same to English ships in Spain. Estimates of the value of the prizes vary but the voyage likely returned a profit of at least 600 per cent. As their share, Drake and his eldest son, John, were given four of the most valuable ships by Raleigh and Sir John Gilbert. On 9 January 1586, Drake was knighted by Elizabeth at Greenwich in recognition of his success. A couple of months later, the surviving Portuguese prisoners, whom Drake had had imprisoned in Exeter, were put on trial, the charge perhaps being mutiny. The trial during the notorious Black Assize of Exeter from 14 March 1586 was held at Exeter Castle. Within little more than three weeks, many of the men of the trial succumbed to disease, as they had been exposed to the Portuguese prisoners, who also succumbed.Kohn, George C. Encyclopedia of Plague and Pestilence: From Ancient Times to the Present, 2008, p.122 Bernard Drake died too in Crediton on 10 April 1586, and was buried two days later while his son John inherited the profits of the Newfoundland voyage. =Consequences= In a precautionary move, the following year, the Spanish government forbade ships to sail to Newfoundland. In the aftermath of the Spanish armada however which resulted in the loss of many ships and with increased English activity over the next century Spanish activity then heavily waned.Pope p 178-18 Drake's raid had thus done serious & lasting damage to the Spanish and Portuguese fishing industries. The Portuguese fishery in particular on the other hand never recovered.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography As a result of Drake's huge success and the impact it had, this enabled the establishment of English and French (Basque) domination in North America and therefore colonial settlement in the early part of the 17th century.

Built in 1834, it is a distinctive example of the regional \\"snecked masonry\\" style, and the oldest known structure of the style to survive. It was used as a school until 1970, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The South Reading Schoolhouse stands in central southern Reading, just west of the rural village of South Reading at the junction of Tyler and Bartley Roads. It is a two-story stone structure, with gabled roof topped by a square belfry with pyramidal roof. Although nominally Greek Revival in style, it is nearly devoid of ornamentation due to its stone construction. The building ends are two bays wide, and the sides four, with sash windows in rectangular openings, and the main entrance in the leftmost bay of the facade facing Tyson Road. A wood frame shed is attached to the west side of the building. The interior consists of two large classroom spaces, one on each floor, with an enclosed stairway on one side. Original floorboards have been covered with modern maple flooring, and the walls are wainscoted and plastered. with The school was built in 1834, probably by Clark Wardner and John Adams, two known practitioners of the \\"snecked masonry\\" style. This method of construction, regionally localized to southern Windsor County, consists of constructing a rubble wall finished with vertically laid slabs of granite, which were readily split from local rock formations. Although the outer layer is in some sense a veneer, in this construction technique they actually form an integral part of the load-bearing aspect of the wall. The technique is believed to have been brought in by Scottish immigrant masons in the early 1830s. This schoolhouse, one of two built in Reading in 1834, are one of the earliest uses of the technique; the oldest documented use, a factory building in Cavendish built in 1832, is no longer standing.

Life Karl Wilhelm Stolle was born into a Protestant family in the village of Frankenhausen, which today has become part of Crimmitschau, a short distance to the north of Zwickau. The \\"protestant\\" label appears to have been replaced with a \\"no religion\\" one fairly early on. His father was a building worker. After attending school locally, Stolle trained in horticulture. He travelled as a gardener's assistant across Germany, the Netherlands, Poland and Russia. Between 1862 and 1879 he owned a horticulture business at Crimmitschau. At the same time he was already active in the workers' education movement from the beginning of the 1860s. In 1866 Stolle joined the newly formed radical democratic Saxon People's Party, which following party mergers in 1869 made him a member of the new German Social Democratic Workers' Party (\\"Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei\\" / SDAP) and of the Socialist Workers' Party(\\"Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands\\" / SAP) in 1875. The lifting of the Anti-Socialist Laws triggered a further consolidated relaunch: that of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) in 1890. Karl Wilhelm Stolle was an activist member throughout these decades. He was a founder of the \\"International Trades Union Fraternity of Factory and Manual workers\\" (\\"Internationale Gewerksgenossenschaft der Manufaktur-, Fabrik- und Handarbeiter\\"). Between 1869 and 1916 he was a delegate at several social democratic party conferences and sat on various party committees. In 1870 he joined with some like minded friends to set up a political printing-publishing co-operative, registered under the name \\"Stolle, Schlegel & Co.\\" This published the \\"Crimmitschauer B√ºrger- und Bauernfreund\\" (\\"\\"Crimmitschau Citizens' and Rural Workers' Friend \\"). The newspaper was suppressed with the implementation of Bismarck's Anti-Socialist Laws, which led to the financial collapse, around 1879, both of the printing-publishing co-operative and of Stolle's horticulture business, after which he is recorded as the owner of a guest house, the \\"Sch√∂nburger Hof\\", in nearby Gesau, close to Glauchau.Karl Wilhelm Stolle (1842‚Äì1918). In: Franz Osterroth: Biographisches Lexikon des Sozialismus. Verstorbene Pers√∂nlichkeiten. Bd. 1. J. H. W. Dietz Nachf., Hannover 1960, pp. 303‚Äì304. At Gesau he sat on the local council between 1886 and 1907. Between 1885 and 1893 or 1897 he was also a member of the Saxon regional parliament (Landtag). After several unsuccessful candidatures, in 1881 Karl Wilhelm Stolle was elected to the national parliament (Reichstag) in the 1881 general election, representing Electoral District 18, which covered Zwickau, Crimmitschau and Werdau, sitting as one of the twelve members of the Socialist Workers' Party which at that time was the only socialist party present in a chamber still dominated by conservative, liberal and \\"catholic centre\\" parties. He continued to sit for the same electoral district till 1918, representing the same party and, after 1890 its successor, till 1917. After 1890 the vote share of the SPD rose rapidly, to reach nearly 35% in the 1912 general election, although this translated into only 110 of the 397 seats in the Reichstag, due to the distortive impact of an old-fashioned voting system and constituency boundaries that had been unchanged since 1871. The party leadership responded to the outbreak of war in 1914 with a political truce which involved voting in the Reichstag for credits to fund the war, and abstaining from criticism of the government for its duration. Support for the political truce was encouraged within the party by the spectre of life under an autocratic Russian Czar if Germany failed to win, but even in 1914 there were prominent SPD members resolutely opposed to the war, grouped around Hugo Haase: Karl Wilhelm Stolle was one of these. Stolle was one of 18 SPD Reichstag members who formed themselves into the so-called Social Democratic Working Group (\\"Sozialdemokratische Arbeitsgemeinschaft\\") within the party, which on 21 December 1915 voted against the renewal of war credits. As economic destitution at home and industrial-scale slaughter on the frontline mounted, in 1917 the SPD itself broke apart and Stolle was one of those who went with the breakaway faction, forming the short-lived Independent Social Democratic Party (\\"Unabh√§ngige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / USPD). Three years later the USPD itself split, with a larger element of its membership joining the new Communist Party, but by that time Karl Wilhelm Stolle had died, aged 75, in March 1918. Personal Karl Wilhelm Stolle was married to Auguste Stolle, born Auguste Wagner. When he died, he left behind his \\"wife and four children\\".Kirchenbuch Eintrag (Church records entry) 1918, page 174 Nr. 10., St. Andreas church, Gesau (a village approx 16 km / 10 miles north of Zwickau) References 1842 births 1918 deaths People from Crimmitschau People from the Kingdom of Saxony German religious humanists Social Democratic Party of Germany politicians Independent Social Democratic Party politicians Members of the 5th Reichstag of the German Empire Members of the 6th Reichstag of the German Empire Members of the 8th Reichstag of the German Empire Members of the 9th Reichstag of the German Empire Members of the 10th Reichstag of the German Empire Members of the 11th Reichstag of the German Empire Members of the 12th Reichstag of the German Empire Members of the 13th Reichstag of the German Empire Members of the Landtag of Saxony German trade unionists ","title":"Karl Wilhelm Stolle"},{"id":"51383511","text":"Campanulotes is a genus of lice in the disputed, probably paraphyletic, family Philopteridae, the chewing lice, or in the family Goniodidae.

She obtained her undergraduate degree from the University of Puerto Rico (Rio Piedras) and attended graduate school in physics at Northwestern University where she obtained her PhD in 1995 with Donald Miller and Ralph Segel as advisors. Research activities Velasco's research career spans a wide range within experimental particle physics. She obtained her Ph.D. by making the first measurement of the spin structure function g2(x) using data collected by the Spin Muon Collaboration. She became a CERN Post-Doctoral Fellow in 1996 with Heinrich Wahl as her advisor. At CERN, she joined the NA48 experiment Collaboration. This experiment made precision measurements of neutral kaons especially as regards CP violation. It also investigated rare kaon decays. Velasco formed her own collaboration to perform the NA59 experiment at CERN. This experiment demonstrated the channeling of high energy particles in bent crystals and studied the production of circularly-polarized high-energy photons. This topic connected well with her pioneering work in the physics potential of photon colliders, which she advocated at the Snowmass Meeting in 2001. Following that meeting, she promoted the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) accelerator at CERN. Velasco joined the faculty in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Northwestern University in 1999. At that time she joined the Main injector oscillation neutrino search (MINOS) Collaboration to study neutrino oscillations. She left MINOS to join the CMS Collaboration at CERN - one of the two general-purpose experiments at the CERN LHC‚Äîwhere she continues to play a leadership role. Her work has an important impact on the current understanding of the Higgs boson: she spearheaded the rare Z+photon decay channel which, in principle, can distinguish the standard model Higgs boson from those beyond the standard model.

The Blue Diamond Mine is located on the hill, and the small community of Blue Diamond, Nevada is located nearby. Several housing projects have been proposed for the hill since 2002. Description Blue Diamond Hill is an upfaulted block, consisting of Permian and Lower Triassic sediments. It has an elevation of 4,931 feet. Nevada has 45 cactus species, 25 of which are located on Blue Diamond Hill. The Blue Diamond cholla is among the cactus species there. Other plant life includes Joshua trees, yucca, and globe mallows. Gypsum mining began on the property in 1925, with the opening of the Blue Diamond Mine. In the 1990s, approximately 17,000 plants were salvaged from the area and its mining operations, to be transplanted in a desert trails park in Logandale, Nevada. The endangered Blue Diamond cholla was protected through a mutual arrangement between James Hardie Gypsum, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and The Nature Conservancy. As of 2000, there were approximately 6,000 Blue Diamond cholla plants on the mountain, occupying 300 acres. It was later discovered that the Blue Diamond cholla also grows in a half-dozen other areas, located in the north half of Clark County, Nevada and in northwest Arizona. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service counted 56,000 Blue Diamond chollas in those areas during 2005. Those located on Blue Diamond Hill are the most accessible. As of 2010, the Blue Diamond cholla was listed by the state as critically endangered. Proposed development =Power plant= In the late 1980s, plans were proposed for a $100 million hydroelectric power plant to be built at Blue Diamond Hill, on land owned by the BLM. It would be built by the Blue Diamond North Pumped Storage Power Co., later known as Blue Diamond Power Partners. Nearby residents initially rejected the proposed project. To alleviate concerns about its proximity to Red Rock Canyon, the proposed site was moved one mile south, on land that was also owned by the BLM and was located near the gypsum mine. Clark County planners were worried about the visual impact that the plant would have on the area, and also expressed concern about dust problems during construction and operation. There were also environmental concerns that the project would affect the Blue Diamond cholla. The power plant would permanently disrupt 104 acres, but would generate a projected $25 million in state and local taxes over a 20-year period. An environmental impact statement for the project was approved in 1996, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved the project a year later. In April 2001, the $320 million project was nearing the end of its permitting process, with construction expected to begin the following year. The Clark County Commission was split on whether to approve the project, while some residents were concerned that the plant would affect the surrounding scenery. Environmentalists considered the project unnecessary. The Sierra Club claimed that the plant would be located within Red Rock Canyon, which was expanded in 1994 to include further land. The BLM later denied that the land was part of Red Rock Canyon. In June 2001, Blue Diamond Power Partners withdrew its request from the Clark County Commission for a use permit, choosing instead to seek a federal permit. U.S. senator Harry Reid introduced a bill that would extend the power plant's FERC licensing, allowing the project to proceed. However, Reid put the bill on hold until issues could be resolved, such as the project's potential impact on the environment. Another condition was that the project receive local approval. The project also needed approval from the Las Vegas Valley Water District. Construction had yet to begin as of 2003, although Blue Diamond Power Partners still intended to proceed. The project remains unbuilt. =Residential projects= In 2002, John Laing Homes proposed a residential community to be built on nearly 3,000 acres atop Blue Diamond Hill, bringing an estimated 21,000 new residents to the area. The proposal was withdrawn later that year after opposition. Developer Jim Rhodes purchased acreage on Blue Diamond Hill in 2003, and has since made several proposals for a housing community on the land, although the projects have been opposed as well.

Life  Born in Weimar, Andreas Oswald was the son of Andreas Oswald Sr., who was the court organist there. In 1643, it is presumed that he moved to Eisenach where his father had gained the position of town organist. At the age of 15, Andreas Jr. was hired as court organist in Weimar, the position which his father had once held. Thus, he was one of Johann Sebastian Bach's predecessors. After the court orchestra was disbanded in 1662, forced to seek employment elsewhere, Oswald obtained the position as town organist in Eisenach, succeeding his father who had recently died. Although employed as an organist, he obtained a reputation in Eisenach as a virtuoso performer on the violin and other instruments. He remained in Eisenach until his death in 1665, aged 30.

He was born at Serrniki, Pinsk. Background Following Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, some Ukrainians chose to collaborate with the Wehrmacht, including Polyukhovich, one of six siblings. He was employed by a forestry department and allegedly participated in the execution of about 850 people from the Jewish ghetto in Serniki in occupied Ukraine and further executions of civilians in the same area between August and September 1942.Profile, trialinternational.org; accessed 21 August 2016.Profile, internationalcrimesdatabase.org; accessed 21 August 2016. When the Germans retreated from Ukraine, Polyukhovich and his second wife Maria left with the German troops and later Polyukhovich was given work in Germany. On 28 December 1949, Polyukhovich, his wife Maria, and two step-daughters arrived in Melbourne, Australia. In 1958, they received Australian citizenship. On 26 December 1986, the Adelaide Advertiser received a telex from the USSR outlining war crimes accusations against Polyukhovich. Limited examinations outside the town of Serniki of 533 selected crania confirmed that 410 of the men, women, and children exhumed had been shot in the head. Polyukhovich denied all accusations of wrongdoing. On 20 December 1988 Australia's federal parliament passed the War Crimes Amendment Bill which allows prosecutions against suspected European criminals in ordinary Australian civilian courts. On 25 January 1990 he was arrested and charged him with 24 counts of murder and complicity in 850 counts of murder. Legal battle See: Polyukhovich v Commonwealth In July 1990, Polyukhovich was shot and wounded on the eve of his trial. Two passersby found him near his home in stable condition.Archive, latimes.com; accessed 21 August 2016. On 3 September 1990 the High Court began hearing a challenge to the constitutional validity of the War Crimes Amendment Act itself. The primary question was whether in 1989 there was either an obligation under customary international law or a matter of international concern that war criminals from the pre-1945 years be sought out and tried for their offences. On 14 August 1991 the war crimes legislation was endorsed by the High Court. According to the High Court, ‚Äúthe Act discharges an international obligation or meets an international concern that persons alleged to be guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity be sought out, brought to trial and, upon conviction, punished, irrespective of the place where the crime was committed or where the alleged offender is found and irrespective of the citizenship or residence of the alleged offender or the victim.‚Äù The court ruled ‚ÄúAustralia‚Äôs international personality would be incomplete if it were unable to exercise a jurisdiction to try and to punish offenders against the law of nations whose crimes are such that their subjection to universal jurisdiction is conducive to international peace and order.‚Äù Conclusion On 28 October 1991 the prosecution opened the case against Polyukhovich in the Adelaide Magistrate Court. On 5 June 1992, he was indicted for only six murders, the rest of the charges were dismissed. On 18 May 1993, he was acquitted by a jury of all charges due to purported difficulties in presenting evidence and testimony clearly identifying the accused.

After an early career in the Russian army, he became a diplomat representing the Swedish crown. Fabritius led three missions to the Safavid court: in 1679-80, 1683‚Äì84, and 1697-1700. His efforts were characterized by the desire to establish a new transit route between Sweden and Iran through Russia (with Narva as its hub), and several attempts to establish a fruitful alliance against the common enemy: the Ottoman Empire. Fabritius presented an invitation to the Safavid king from the Swedish king to join the Holy League, and was involved in the establishment of several Safavid-Swedish economic and trade agreements. Life Fabriutius was born Lodewyck Fabritius in Brazil of Dutch parents. He moved to the Tsardom of Russia in 1660‚Äì61 with his grandfather, and pursued a career in the Russian army as an officer. Fabritius participated in a number of military campaigns under the Russian banner until he was captured while fighting Stenka Razin and his Cossack forces. After spending three months in captivity in Astrakhan, enslaved by Tatars, he regained his freedom and moved to the Safavid Empire with other Dutch refugees. When Fabritius arrived in Isfahan (the Safavid capital) he turned down a position in the Dutch East India Company, and moved back to Russia in 1672. Five years later, he resigned from the Russian military service and moved to Sweden. Fabritius' diplomatic career began in the late 1670s, and his first mission (to Iran) was to facilitate the opening of a transit route to Europe via Russia. In 1667, the tsar had given Iranian Armenians the right to maintain their trade network through this route. Six years later, a modified version of the privilege contributed to notable commerce between the Russian cities of Moscow and Archangelsk. Sweden then planned to connect the Russian trade route to the Baltic one, with Narva as the hub. Swedish king Charles XI decided to send a new diplomatic mission to Safavid in 1678, and chose Fabritius to lead it. Since he apparently paid for the mission with his own money, an arrangement had probably been made with the Armenian merchants of Safavid Iran or those in the Russian tsardom. Due to the \\"reticence of the Persian sources, scant references in western sources, and the absence of a regular correspondence on the part of Fabritius\\", it is difficult to ascertain details of the mission. According to the Encyclopedia Iranica, Fabritius may have arrived in the Safavid capital in 1680 and was given an audience the following spring. His proposals, which he presented in September 1681, included permission for Iranian merchants to enter Swedish territory; two years' exemption from tolls, and a Swedish commitment to build ships in the Caspian Sea. The Safavid king, Suleiman I of Persia (r. 1666-1694), agreed to the Swedish proposal diverting the trade route via Narva and Russia. However, the Safavid agreement added that this would be done only if the Safavid-Armenian merchants (and the other merchants in general) \\"would be so inclined\\". In the official Safavid response which Fabritius returned to Sweden, the Safavid king did not refer to concerns about trade and merely thanked the Swedish king (and his envoy) for the mission. The Armenian merchants of the Safavid Empire were more pleased with the mission; in a letter from a Safavid Armenian to Charles XI, an Armenian merchant expressed willingness to try the Novgorod-Narva route. The mayor (or magistrate, kalƒÅntar) of the Armenian quarter of the Safavid capital expressed interest in Caspian Swedish-Iranian shipbuilding cooperation and promised to \\"urge\\" the other Armenians to use the new route. It was eventually agreed that a delegation of silk merchants from the Armenian quarter of Julfa would accompany Fabritius on his return to Sweden, where they arrived in late 1682; after their arrival, Charles XI commissioned Fabritius to undertake a new mission. The ambassador's second trip, which began in April 1683, is \\"relatively well documented\\". The Swedish mission arrived in the Safavid capital in March 1684, and was received by king Suleiman I in late July. Astrological advice given to the king and (perhaps) the Safavid court to await the results of negotiations with the Dutch, with whom the Safavids were \\"embroiled\\" in armed conflict, forced Fabritius to wait to present his letters to the Safavid king until September. New commercial proposals were made, and, more importantly, a Swedish proposal for Safavid Iran to join the European-led anti-Ottoman alliance known as the Holy League. The discussion during Fabritius' private audience with the Safavid king and the writings of Engelbert Kaempfer, secretary to the mission, present different versions of Charles XI's readiness to send troops to assist Iran in its struggle against the Ottomans. The Safavid king eventually declined the invitation to join the Holy League, based upon his \\"pacifist inclination\\" and a realistic assessment of his army's strength compared with the Ottomans'. Over the next three years Fabritius was received eleven times by the Safavid monarch, who assured him that he would oblige the Swedish king in all his wishes and proposals except \\"to resume hostilities with the Ottomans\\". The mission led to the opening of the Narva route, which (due to logistical facilities and preferential tolls) was a serious competitor of the Archangelsk route by the late 1680s. During the 1690s, Armenian merchants made efforts to open a trade route through the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and Kurland. This caused the Swedish king to send Fabritius on his third mission, \\"designed to publicize the advantages of the Narva connection\\". Information about this third (and final) mission, is scarce. The mission left Stockholm in May 1697 for Moscow (from where it departed on 28 September of that year), arriving on 8 November 1698 at the Safavid capital of Isfahan. Fabritius' requests at the Safavid court included obtaining the same rights for Swedish merchants in the Safavid Empire as Safavid merchants had in Swedish territory, lower tolls, and a hostel for Swedish merchants \\"similar to the one that accommodated Armenians in Narva\\". Fabritius also asked the Safavid king, Sultan Husayn (r. 1694-1722), to request free transit rights for Swedish merchants travelling to and from Sweden from Russian Tsar Ivan V (r. 1682-1696). Since Charles XI had died shortly before Fabritius' departure, Fabritius also informed the Safavid king about the new Swedish king: Charles XII. He also obtained an agreement that the Safavid Iranians would send a delegation to Sweden. In spring 1699 Fabritius left for Sweden with Saru Khan Beg, the new Safavid ambassador to Sweden, and they arrived on 26 May 1700. Relations between Russia and Sweden had deteriorated by that time, which led to the outbreak of the Great Northern War. The war \\"effectively\\" ended the possibility of a trade link between Safavid Iran and Sweden through Russian territory. Fabritius died on 6 October 1729 in Stockholm.

Biography Sketch for Making Coloured Parachutes (Art.IWM ART LD 4957) Carr was born in Belfast to a well-to-do family and attended Oundle School where his art masters included E.M.O'R. Dickey and Christopher Perkins. In 1927 Carr moved to London where he studied at the Slade School of Art. After two years at the Slade, Carr moved to Italy and spent a year in Settignano near Florence. Upon returning to London, Carr established himself as a well-regarded painter of domestic scenes. Although essentially a realist painter, Carr was included in the 1934 Objective Abstractionists exhibition at Zwemmer's Gallery. In 1937, Carr shared an exhibition with Victor Pasmore and Claude Rogers at the Storran Gallery and subsequently became associated with the representational style of the Euston Road school. Starting in 1940, at Wildenstein's gallery, Carr held a series of one-man exhibitions at various galleries including at the Leicester Galleries, the Redfern Gallery and also at Agnew's. In 1939, Carr returned to Northern Ireland and settled in Newcastle, County Down where he spent the Second World War. During the War, Carr received a small number of commissions from the War Artists' Advisory Committee to depict parachute manufacture and the Short Sunderland flying-boats being built at the Short Brothers factory in Belfast. After the War, Carr taught at the Belfast College of Art and moved to Belfast in 1955. After the death of his wife in 1995, Carr moved to Norfolk to be nearer one of his three daughters and her family. Carr continued to paint into old age, and tended to concentrate on landscape painting. A large retrospective exhibition of Carr's work was held in Belfast and then Dublin in 1985. Carr was a regular exhibitor at the Royal Academy and was a member of the Royal Ulster Academy, the New English Art Club, the Royal Watercolour Society and was an honorary member of the Royal Hibernian Academy. Queen's University awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1991. For his services to art in Northern Ireland, Carr was awarded the MBE in 1974 and received an OBE in 1993.

Civic coinages - emissions made by individual cities at their own volition - continued under the first two and a half centuries of Roman control until ending in the mid-first century AD. Some non-civic coins were minted on behalf of Roman emperors during this period and continued to be minted after the cessation of the civic coinages. After the cessation of the civic coinages, these Imperial coins were the only coins minted in Iberia until the coins of the Suebi and Visigoths. Ancient Iberia was connected to the eastern and central Mediterranean, and so there are links to the Greek, Roman and Punic (Carthaginian) civic coinages. Yet there are also many points of difference that reflect dynamics within Iberia itself. The colonial background: 6th century BC to the Second Punic War (-218 BC) Small numbers of coins minted in other parts of the Mediterranean had circulated along the eastern coast of Spain perhaps from the sixth century, with an uptick from the fourth century. These coins were part of a colonial frontier economy in which indigenous towns traded wines, ceramics and finished goods primarily for raw materials: precious metals, wood, food products and perhaps slaves. Some coins may also have been earned by Iberian mercenaries fighting overseas. Throughout the western Mediterranean, new coinage traditions appear around the 4th century. Non-Greek cities in the Italian Peninsula (including Rome) begin minting in the 4th and early 3rd century. Carthage minted from the mid-4th century, as with the Greek tradition following earlier emissions from Phoenician colonies in Sicily. In the north of the Iberian peninsula, the Massiliote colonies of Emporion and Rhode minted mainly silver coins from the mid-fifth and late fourth centuries, respectively. Further to the south, the Phoenician colonies of Ebusus and Gadir minted bronze coins from the second half of the fourth and early third centuries, respectively. Additionally, the prominent Iberian town of Arse (Roman Saguntum) minted bronze and silver coins from the middle of the fourth century. Within Iberian society, wealth could take a variety of forms, sometimes regionally specific. The discovery of mixed hoards containing coins, jewellery and precious metal bullion suggests that coins were being used as part of a range of ways to store, display and exchange wealth. For example, a late fifth century hoard found in a wall in the Iberian town of Puig de la Nau contained four gold earrings, a gold stud, a silver bracelet and a silver coin from Emporion. In many such hoards, some of the silver has been cut into small pieces, which can be related to finds of weights and scales and suggests that this metal circulated as a form of 'proto-money'. Second Punic War (218-205 BC in Iberia) Part of the Second Punic War was fought in the Iberian Peninsula and coins were used by combatants on all sides. This led to a widespread and dramatic increase in the number of places where coins were minted and the amount of coin in circulation. To fund their war effort, the Carthaginians minted gold, electrum, silver and bronze coins. These coins may have been minted in the Barcid 'capital' of Carthago Nova or perhaps were minted simply in Carthaginian military camps. In addition to these coins and those of Gadir and Ebusus, Phoenician colonies along the south coast such as Malaka and Sexi also minted bronze coins. Along the east coast and particularly in the northeast a great number of towns minted silver drachmas. Some of these coins imitate the drachmas of Emporion or Massalia, while others have Iberian legends, a few of which can be related to towns or peoples but many of which are unknown or illegible. This silver coinage is generally seen as minted by the pro-Roman side, particularly as little Roman coin seems to have reached the Peninsula given the concurrent fighting in the Italian Peninsula. But given the fluid situation of the war, particularly in the early years, some of these emissions may have been minted to aid the Carthaginian cause. Republican coinage (190s-72 BC)  After this war, and the subsequent Roman annexation of much of the Peninsula, many indigenous towns and a few Roman colonial towns minted civic coins over the second and early first centuries. The main catalogue for these coins is the Corpus nummum hispaniae ante Augusti aetatem (CNH) but see also the more recent Diccionario de cecas y pueblos hisp√°nicos. The indigenous towns in Hispania Citerior minted coins with Iberian scripts and either Iberian or Celtiberian legends. These coins were often typologically similar, with a heroic male portrait on the obverse and a horseman on the reverse - the so-called \\"jinete\\" (horseman) coins. The areas in which coins were minted and circulating expanded as Roman control was spread into the interior of the Peninsula. The legends and iconography on coins from Hispania Ulterior were more diverse, with Latin legends common but also some Iberian scripts while Punic continued to be used in the old Phoenician colonies along the south coast. Hence although coins from this era are often called Iberian coins, this description does not cover all coins minted during the Republic. Indeed, a smaller number of Roman colonial towns minted in Latin, following Italian and Roman examples more closely. These include Valentia and Toletum. The numbers of towns minting peaked in the last third of the second century and early first century, and then declined rapidly in the early first century, particularly in Hispania Citerior after the end of the Sertorian War. The purpose of these coins is unclear. They may be related to ad hoc Roman tribute demands or rents on land confiscated by Rome. But the amounts minted are insufficient to represent regular taxation or legionary pay. Widely varying levels of production suggest that the reasons each town minted were diverse. Some coins seem tightly related to particular extractive or productive actitivites, such as mining camps in the south or fish-salting industries along the south coast. As the decision to mint was taken by local communities, and many elements of the legends and iconography seem locally significant, there may have been a strong element of local pride and identity at stake. Once in circulation, Iberian coins predominantly stayed within the region where they were minted although some did travel further afield. The production of many bronze coins and even many fractions as well as high numbers of coins found throughout all different types of site, from large towns to small farms, suggest a wide range of everyday uses. Late Republican and Julio-Claudian coinage (72 BC-41 AD) From around the mid-first century BC, the number of towns emitting coins decreased and Latin legends were standardised throughout the Peninsula. Coins were mainly now emitted by more important towns that had received privileged juridical status from victorious Roman generals in the Civil Wars and then from the new Julio-Claudian emperors Augustus and Tiberius. Many of the coins emitted proclaim the new status of emitting towns as Roman coloniae or municipia, and individual civic iconography was used with strong similarities to that used in other Roman provinces and media. These emissions are conventionally called (Roman) Provincial coins. The main catalogue for these coins is Volume I of the Roman Provincial Coinage (RPC). A handful of mints in eastern Iberia did attempt to retain the jinete coins with bilingual Iberian and Latin legends, but this did not become popular. The peak of these provincial emissions was under Augustus and Tiberius, and the last 'local' coins were emitted under the emperor Caligula, in the mid-first century AD. This cessation of local coinage in the mid-first century AD was not unique to Hispania but occurred throughout the western Provinces. From that point on the only emissions in Roman Hispania were emissions from a few Imperial mints controlled by the emperor and used for purposes such as legionary pay. Two main reasons are given for the provincial emissions. Firstly, the new municipia and coloniae wanted to advertise their status and Imperial favour. Secondly, these new constitutional forms came with state expenses. These emissions may have been intended to partly meet such expenses. Once these coins were in circulation, they were likely used in the broad range of roles coins played in Roman monetised economic life.

DSM I classified these orientations under \\"paraphilia\\", and DSM II under \\"sexual orientation disturbance\\". DSM II further modified this to \\"ego- dystonic homosexuality\\", before finally dropping the subject from DSM-II-R (and subsequent editions). DSM-II The DSM-II considered homosexuality as one form of paraphilia, but in the seventh printing of DSM-II homosexuality had shifted to another classification, which is sexual orientation disturbance. This major change had been preceded by increasing activities of the LGBT community in the 1960s, specifically the Stonewall riots in 1969. These activities continued in 1970 with the following predominant events: *As described by Ronald Bayer, a psychiatrist and gay rights activist, specific protests by gay rights activists against the APA began in 1970, when the organization held its convention in San Francisco. The activists disrupted the conference by interrupting speakers and shouting down and ridiculing psychiatrists who viewed homosexuality as a mental disorder. In 1971, gay rights activist Frank Kameny worked with the Gay Liberation Front collective to demonstrate against the APA's convention. At the 1971 conference, Kameny grabbed the microphone and yelled: \\"Psychiatry is the enemy incarnate. Psychiatry has waged a relentless war of extermination against us. You may take this as a declaration of war against you.\\"Ronald Bayer Homosexuality and American Psychiatry: The Politics of Diagnosis (1981) Princeton University Press. p. 105 This activism occurred in the context of a broader anti- psychiatry movement that had come to the fore in the 1960s and was challenging the legitimacy of psychiatric diagnosis. Anti-psychiatry activists protested at the same APA conventions, with some shared slogans and intellectual foundations.McCommon, B.

(2006) Letter in reply Psychiatr Serv 57:1809-a-1810, December 2006 Presented with data from researchers such as Alfred Kinsey and Evelyn Hooker, the seventh printing of the DSM-II, in 1974, no longer listed homosexuality as a category of disorder. After a vote by the APA trustees in 1973, and confirmed by the wider APA membership in 1974, the diagnosis was replaced with the category of \\"sexual orientation disturbance\\". * 1973 ‚Äì On 15 October the Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatry Federal Council declares homosexuality not an illness ‚Äì the first such body in the world to do so; in December the American Psychiatric Association removes homosexuality from its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-II), based largely on the research and advocacy of Evelyn Hooker. DSM-III In DSM-III, homosexuality had been shifted to a new \\"Ego-dystonic homosexuality\\" classification. DSM-III-R In DSM-III-R, the new \\"Ego-dystonic homosexuality\\" classification was also removed and was largely subsumed under \\"sexual disorder not otherwise specified\\", which can include \\"persistent and marked distress about one's sexual orientation.

The unique drive-thru corn crib (1936) and the water tower (c. 1920) are the structures. The large farmhouse is a rural vernacular form of the American Foursquare known as the Cornbelt Cube. It is a two-story frame structure capped by a hip roof. It has an odd wing on the northwest side that houses the main kitchen on the first floor and a bedroom on the second. Emil Tyden This was one of eight farms in Floyd and Butler Counties owned by Emil Tyden, a native of Sweden who immigrated to Moline, Illinois in 1882. He eventually worked for the Union Pacific Railroad where he noticed the inefficiency of sealing boxcars. He developed and patented the \\"Tyden Self-Locking Seal,\\" a tamper- proof device that fit any boxcar locking mechanism. He made a fortune from his invention, opening a factory in Hastings, Michigan. While remaining in Hastings Tyden began to acquire farms in North Central Iowa in 1915, and his holdings grew to almost . He hired resident farm managers and hired hands to operate each farm. Tyden modernized the farms and employed \\"new agriculture\\" methods espoused by Iowa State College in Ames that made extensive use of science and technology to improve farming methods and production. He continued to maintain and expand his holdings during the economic downturn in farming in the 1920s and the Great Depression. Tyden bought this farm in 1936, and began making improvements. In 1941 he released all his employees after the harvest and leased the farms out to farmers to run as they saw fit. Tyden died in 1951. He still owned Farm No. 6, and it remained in the family until 1994. The farm is now part of the Silos & Smokestacks National Heritage Area and houses farming exhibits and tours.

Subject The subject is the Old Testament story of Noah when drunk. Shem and Japheth averted their eyes from their father's nudity, and covered him, but Ham mocked his father. The story is found in Genesis 9. The story is illustrated in many Biblia Pauperum and the Speculum Humanae Salviationis. It is also illustrated in the Great East Window of York Minster, and the Tudor stained glass of Kings College Chapel - of a very similar date to the painting (tenth window, upper right). By the medieval period much thought had been given to the story and the Egerton Genesis includes expository material, some of it dating back to Origen. In 1519 both of Martin Luther's sermons dealt with the analogy between Ham mocking Noah and the Jews mocking Christ. Artist Bernardino Luini (c. 1480/82 ‚Äì June 1532) was a North Italian painter from Leonardo's circle. Both Luini and Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio were said to have worked with Leonardo directly; he was described to have taken \\"as much from Leonardo as his native roots enabled him to comprehend\\".Freedberg, 1993, p. 390.

Hardman showing the Resurrection and Crucifixion, was installed. In 1857 the chancel and nave were rebuilt, and the north aisle was added; these were designed by H. Woodyer. Also at this time the pews, and baptismal font were added. The vestry was added around 1887, at the same time as the organ chamber and the south-facing porch on the tower.

The sermon is advertised as available for purchase for threepence at Jacobi's bookshop, the German Booksellers near Somserset House on the Strand. John Christian Jacobi, also Johann Christian Jacobi, (1670-1750) was a German- born translator and dealer in religious books, particularly those connected with Halle Pietism. He served as keeper of the Royal German Chapel, St James's Palace from 1714 until his death. Life and works In the 1680s Jacobi attended the University of Halle, one of the main centres of Lutheranism, where the leading Pietist August Hermann Francke set up various educational institutions. While at Halle, he came into contact with English students; and in 1708 he moved to England to start work as a translator and bookseller in London, opening a bookshop near Somerset House in the Strand, London in 1709. He specialised in religious tracts, using his contacts with Francke in Halle and John Downing of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge in London. Known as the \\"German bookseller on the Strand\\", his bookshop imported German bibles, prayer books and hymnals for the German Lutheran community in London, whose activities centred around the Lutheran chapel of St Mary in Savoy. (Heinrich Eler in Halle was one of his main suppliers.) He produced several English translations including Estrid: An Account of a Swedish Maid, who hath Lived Six Years without Food (1711). In 1712 Jacobi was already married; the baptism of his son John Owen with Mary Magdalen Jacobi was recorded in June 1712 at St Paul's, Covent Garden. Jacobi's bookshop moved to Southampton Row on the Strand in the same year. In 1714 he was appointed \\"chapel-keeper\\" (or verger) of the Royal German Chapel, St James's Palace, which provided Lutheran services for the Hanoverian court. The first chaplain there was Francke's main associate in England, Anthony William Boehm, a close friend of Jacobi. In 1717 he moved his business further along the Strand to the less expensive Exeter Exchange, which housed a number of foreign language bookshops. Although Jacobi had tried to diversify to serve a French readership, he stopped selling books by 1719. His German bookshop was the first of its kind in England and it was 30 years before another one opened in London. Jacobi's version of Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland opens Psalmodia Germanica, 1722 In 1722 Jacobi published the first edition of his Psalmodia Germanica, or a Specimen of Divine Hymns, Translated from the High Dutch, a collection of English translations of German Lutheran hymns. The dedication to the Royal Princesses Anne, Amalia and Carolina read, \\"The following sheets exhibit a translation of psalmody, used in the native country of your Royal Highnesses, which (as well as other protestant countries) is blessed with those spiritual hymns, to the frequent use thereof the Apostle doth so solemnly exhort.\\" The Psalmodica also contained two works by Isaac Watts. Three editions of Jacobi's hymnbook appeared between 1722 and 1732. After his death a new edition was prepared in 1765, containing some new translations. According to , Jacobi's hymnbook was widely adopted by Lutherans in the New World as the first available English translations; and it was also used by the Moravian Church in England. recounts how Jacobi befriended leaders of the Moravian Church during its revival in England: on one of his missions to London in 1735, the leading Moravian churchman David Nitschmann lodged with Jacobi for two months. Later that year‚Äîinspired by Nitschmann but discouraged by Friedrich Michael Ziegenhagen, Boehm's successor at the Royal German Chapel in 1722‚ÄîJacobi, accompanied by his three daughters, made the journey to Herrnhut in Saxony, where the original Moravian movement had been offered protection. In the same year Jacobi translated the biography of Boehm by Johann Jacob Rambach into English. In 1748, the second volume of Lives of Martyrs was published with Jacobi's English translation of a French tract on the Huguenot Elias Neau, entitled \\"A short account of the life and sufferings of Elias Neau upon the galleys, and in the dungeons of Marseilles, for the constant profession of the Protestant religion.\\" Jacobi's translation was published separately in London the following year. Jacobi was buried at St Paul's, Covent Garden in 1750.

The union consisted of the Russian nobility and gentry. United Nobility was one of several landowners' organisations which were established in the wake of the Russian peasant uprisings of 1905‚Äì06, and the largest estates joined these groups as a part of a larger \\"gentry reaction\\" to the violence directed towards Russian squires.Figes, p. 206 Its leader was Count Aleksei Bobrinsky, brother-in-law of later Prime Minister Georgy Lvov. It was established to defend the property rights and the domination in local politics of the gentry.Figes, p. 227‚Äì228 The Union had a strong presence in the State Council, with one third of all members being a member, and prevented the passing of liberal reforms from the Duma.Figes, p. 216 It had powerful supporters in the Tsar's court, the State Council and the Civil Service, and led a campaign against the liberal reform proposals of the Duma.Figes, p. 220 After 1905 it became the 'firmest pillar of autocracy'.Figes, p. 287 Background During the Russian peasants' uprising of 1905‚Äì06 a large wave of peasant violence directed at the provincial squires and landlords erupted. This resulted in a change in the political leanings of the provincial squires, who had been avid supporters of liberal reform in 1904‚Äì1905, who now became (mainly) passive or inactive reactionaries. Many were also scared off their estates, and between 1906 and 1914 one-fifth of all gentry land were sold to peasants, with the portion nearing one-third in the most rebellious areas of 1905‚Äì1906. Those who remained, the majority, there was a 'hardening resolution to defend their property rights', and these landowners started loud calls for a restoration of law and order in the provinces and countryside. This coincided with a change in the nature of the zemstvos, who previously had been liberal organisations, and now became 'pillars of conservatism', and from being focused on the improvement of the peasantry's condition, they now became preoccupied with the most narrow concerns of the gentry. The largest estates and landowners joined the United Nobility, led by Count Aleksei Bobrinsky, and now established to defend the property rights of the gentry, and their domination in local politics. His brother-in-law Prince Georgy Lvov was voted off the Tula zemstvo in the winter of 1905‚Äì1906, with Bobrinsky condemning him as a 'dangerous liberal'.Figes, p. 207 One third of the members of the State Council, a consultative assembly of nobles, belonged to the United Nobility, and helped to bar any passing of liberal reforms from the Duma. It had powerful supporters in the Tsar's court, the State Council and the Civil Service, and it led a campaign against the liberal reform proposals of the Duma on 'the grounds that granting additional land to the peasants would not help solve their problems, since these were caused by the inefficiency of the communal system and not by the shortage of land.' The United Nobility were the 'most vociferous' of the groups against Stolypin's reforms, as his local government reforms threatened their domination in local politics by giving peasants as landowners equal representation in the zemstvos. They subsequently were one of the groups accusing Stolypin of attempting of 'undermine \\"provincial society\\" (which meant themselves) through bureaucratic centralisation'. The Petrograd and Moscow branches of the United Nobility were some of those who urged the Tsar to let the Duma elect a government in November 1916, as by this time even they ‚Äì 'since 1905 the firmest pillar of autocracy' ‚Äì had recognised the need of fundamental changes of government.

Family  The great-grandfather of Raduloviƒá decided to abandon his hard working life in Tulje near Trebinje and moved to Mostar to work as stonemason. His two sons, Jovo and Lazo started trading business and established trading connections with Trieste. Their descendants continued trading business but were also active in political and cultural life, some of them being actors in theater. Members of Raduloviƒá's family participated in the uprisings of 1875 and 1882 so Raduloviƒá was brought up as an enemy of Austria-Hungary.  Editorial work  In 1897 Raduloviƒá was an editor of the school paper \\"Serbdom\\" () published since Summer of 1896 by the \\"Serb consciousness\\" (), –∞ secret students' society of the Gymnasium in Mostar established in Autumn of 1895. In 1897 Raduloviƒá was the first student who was expelled from Mostar school. At the beginning of 1907 a group of Serb intellectuals in Mostar began publishing of the journal \\"People\\" () which was edited by Raduloviƒá. Raduloviƒá closely collaborated with Aleksa ≈†antiƒá, Svetozar ƒÜoroviƒá, Atanasije ≈†ola and other notable Mostar intellectuals, and was also very active in Gusle Singing Society. Raduloviƒá was an editor of the journal \\"Pregled\\" since August 1910. In his texts Raduloviƒá expressed his affinity toward Yugoslavism, as a way to overcome destructive national antagonisms.  Young Bosnia  Bogdan ≈Ωerajiƒá decided to assassinate General Marijan Vare≈°anin, the Governor of Bosnia and Herzegovina, after he read an article written by Risto Raduloviƒá, who argued against dispiritedness in the public life of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In his article, Raduloviƒá explained that he did not see glorious moments of the nation nor a single tragedy which he believed was necessary to temper the struggle. When ≈Ωerajiƒá read these words he yelled \\"There will be a tragedy!\\". Raduloviƒá was the central figure of anti occupational movement before the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria Members of Young Bosnia followed his political course. Still, he disagreed with their glorification of the peasantry. He believed that authentic nationalism is cultural phenomenon connected with educated people in enlightened civic societies. Raduloviƒá belonged to large group of notable Serbs who were imprisoned after the assassination. Raduloviƒá was first imprisoned in Tuzla until the end of December 1914 when he was moved to Arad concentration camp where he met his father and died there on 15 March 1915. In 1922 his remnants were transferred from Arad to Mostar.

In the game, the player flies an armoured car shooting enemy invaders to destroy a terrorist organisation. Night Striker combines gameplay elements of Sega's Space Harrier and Out Run. Versions were released for the Sega Mega-CD in 1993, Sony PlayStation in 1995, and Sega Saturn (as Night Striker S) in 1996. A version was released on the Taito Memories II Gekan compilation for the PlayStation 2 in 2007. Night Striker received mixed reviews, and the Mega-CD version in particular was heavily criticised, primarily due to poor graphics. The music was composed by Taito's Zuntata sound team, and has been released separately. The game was only released in Japan.  Plot  The game is set in a futuristic city in 2049. A terrorist organisation has kidnapped Doctor Masker Lindberry and his daughter. The United Nations Special Service Agency has dispatched their agents to investigate, but to no avail. Its leader is leading a task force (code named Night Striker) using armoured vehicles to rescue them and destroy the organisation.  Gameplay  A typical game in progress The player controls the car and shoots enemies encountered during the stage. Enemies and bosses include helicopters, aeroplanes, lorries, robotic spiders, and boulders. The car can be manoeuvred in a similar manner to Space Harrier; can be moved around the screen. There are 21 stages, although the player only needs to complete six to complete the game. Stages' themes include, factories, tunnels, and city themes such as centres, suburbs, and streets. Certain stages contain obstacles such as barriers which must be manoeuvred around. At the end of each stage, there is a boss, and after its defeat, the player is presented with a choice of route, like Out Run. The car's \\"armour\\" refers to its shield capability; the car can absorb a certain number of hits before being destroyed. Defeating a boss gives the shield the capacity to withstand another hit. If the shield has run out and the car is hit, the game is over. In certain final stages, the car transforms: depending on the stage, it can become vehicles such as a motorbike or a robot. The game features different endings depending on which route is taken. The Mega CD version features an arranged soundtrack, and the Saturn version a bonus mode with six levels exclusive to this version.  Reception  Night Striker received mixed reviews. The Mega CD version suffers from poor graphics quality, as noted by reviewers. Mean Machines Sega noted that the graphics are \\"stupendously bad\\", and the sprites are \\"totally unrecognisable\\". Sega Power complained about the blocky sprites and lack of introduction and animated sequences, and also described the game as \\"Unoriginal\\". The Japanese Sega Saturn Magazine gave a mediocre review. Neil West of Mega was especially negative: he criticised the graphics, saying the sprites, along with the flicker and \\"blocky\\" explosions, cause \\"a nightmarish mess of colour\\". He further condemned the lack of originality and challenge, and described the gameplay as \\"a shambolic travesty of modern entertainment\\". He described Night Striker as a \\"load of crap\\" and recommended that players \\"avoid this at all costs\\". The only positive comments he made were about the \\"fantastic\\" sound effects and \\"superb\\" music. The arcade version fared much better. Computer and Video Games described the graphics as \\"beautiful\\", praised its action, and described the game as a \\"must-play\\". In Japan, Game Machine listed night Striker on their August 15, 1989 issue as being the fourth most-successful upright arcade unit of the year. Your Sinclair praised the rolling road sequences, and commented that the car would look like a blob on the ZX Spectrum.  Music  The soundtrack was composed by Zuntata, and released on the Night Striker Complete Album on 21 May 1993 in Japan by Pony Canyon and Scitron. A similar album was released by Pony Canyon on 19 November 1993. The soundtrack was released on iTunes on 2 July 2008, and certain tracks were released on vinyl on Zuntata's Arcade Classics Volume One album.

The leaders of the expedition were Pedro de Sousa Holstein and Jo√£o Carlos de Saldanha. This liberal offensive was unsuccessful, so the Liberals were forced to take refuge on the ship and go back to England.  Background  After the Napoleonic War, the British ruled Portugal in the name of the absent king who was in Brazil, with Beresford as the de facto Regent, until the Liberal Revolution of 1820 when they were driven out and the king was forced to return as a constitutional monarch. Over the next 25 years the fledgling Portuguese democracy experienced several military upheavals, especially the Liberal Wars fought between the brothers Dom Pedro, ex-Emperor of Brazil and King Dom Miguel. Dom Miguel controlled the Portuguese mainland from 1828 until 1832. To assert the cause of his daughter Maria da Gl√≥ria, Pedro sailed in 1832 from Terceira in the Azores with an expeditionary force consisting of 60 vessels and 7500 men, mostly mercenaries. Meanwhile, Miguel's fleet was comprehensively defeated by Pedro's much smaller squadron, commanded by Charles Napier, in the fourth Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1833). The Miguelites were driven out of Lisbon but returned and attacked the city in force, unsuccessfully. Miguel was finally defeated at the Battle of Asseiceira, on 16 May 1834, and capitulated a few days later with the Concession of Evoramonte. Despite his forced exile, many Portuguese continued to fight for his cause up until the 1850s.

A portrait of Jan Pranger by Frans van der Mijn is on display in the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam.Rijksmuseum.nl  Biography  = Early life and career on the Dutch Gold Coast = Jan Pranger was born in 1700 in Amsterdam to Jan Pranger Sr., a wine merchant, and Johanna van Eden. The family belonged to the middle class of the Dutch Republic. In 1720, Jan Pranger was employed by the Dutch West India Company as an assistant to the merchants in Elmina, one of the lowest administrative ranks available on the Dutch Gold Coast. He soon made career though, and in 1724 was made head of Fort Cr√®vec≈ìur in Accra, an office which came with the rank of head merchant (Dutch: oppercommies) and with membership of the Colonial Council in Elmina. When Director-General Valckenier resigned in 1725, he advised the Colonial Council to install either Robert Norris or Jan Pranger as his successor. Probably because of his young age, Jan Pranger was passed in favour of Robert Norris, but when Norris resigned in 1729, he was eventually selected for the post of Director-General. Jan Pranger was officially installed on 6 March 1730. As Director-General, Pranger came into conflict with head merchant Hendrik Hertogh of the factory in Jaquim on the Dutch Slave Coast, which was subordinate to the Director-General of the Dutch Gold Coast. When in 1732 the factory in Jaquim was pillaged and burned by the Kingdom of Dahomey, Pranger sent a party under the leadership of Jacobus Elet to Dahomey to negotiate with the king. Although initially the mission seemed successful, in the end the relationship with Dahomey proved to be damaged beyond repair. Out of frustration with the situation in Dahomey, Pranger petitioned the Colonial Council with his resignation on 3 May 1733, and on 13 March 1734, his successor Antonius van Overbeke was installed. In June 1735, Pranger finally left the Gold Coast on a slave ship headed for Suriname. As he fell ill during the voyage, he only departed Suriname in the spring of 1736. He eventually arrived in the Dutch Republic on 15 June 1736. = Later life = Jan Pranger's second wife Machteld Muilman, by Frans van der Mijn. Almost immediately after his arrival, on 5 July 1736, he married Elisabeth Oloff, who died a little more than three years later, on 5 December 1739. Pranger remarried Machteld Muilman on 14 September 1745. Pranger had become a wealthy man in Africa. After his retirement from service in Africa, he owned in a house on the Singel canal in Amsterdam, and a country seat outside of the city. He employed four domestic servants and owned three horses.

The placename means either \\"cold hill\\" or \\"bare/exposed hill.\\" History Fourknocks Passage Tomb dates to 3000‚Äì2500 BC. It was unknown to archaeology until 1949, when a woman making a visit to Newgrange mentioned, \\"there are mounds like this on my uncle‚Äôs farm.\\" It is not marked on any of the old Ordnance Survey maps. It was first excavated in 1950-52 by PJ Hartnett. He found cists, grave goods including a foot bowl and a carved antler pin, urns containing cremated remains and a posthole. Unlike other passage graves, the tomb at Fourknocks is not believed to have been covered over with stones. A wooden pole may have held up a wooden or animal-skin roof. During reconstruction after excavation, a concrete roof was placed over the chamber for protection. Description Carved stone at Fourknocks. Southern lintel. Fourknocks has a short passage leading into a wide, pear-shaped chamber with three smaller offset chambers. The original roof was likely a wooden structure supported by a central pole. Two of the lintels have chevron decoration and one of them has lozenge decoration. Two other mounds in the Fourknocks complex were excavated. One of these likely served as the cremation site for the bones found in the main tomb and was used for later interments.

However, the Maniitsoq structure has not been widely recognised as an impact structure, and the proposal was criticised for not meeting established criteria for recognising impact craters . Subsequent studies in the region have found no evidence for an impact structure, and a number of observations that directly contradict the earlier impact structure proposals . The Maniitsoq structure is not recognised as an impact structure by the Earth Impact Database .  Impact structure proposal  Garde et al. suggested the presence of an ~100 km scale impact structure, formed by the impact of a large comet or meteorite, in the Maniitsoq region. They argued that consensus accepted diagnositic criteria for recognising impacts should be relaxed when searching for particularly large, ancient, and eroded impacts, and instead suggested the presence of an impact structure on the basis of the following observations: 1) the presence of an irregular aeromagnetic anomaly; 2) curved ~100 km scale deformation patterns; 3) intense fracturing; 4) sheets of crushed rock without the presence of faults; 5) a 35 x 50 km2 central domain of homogenised rocks (the Finnefjeld Orthogneiss Complex) ; 6) remelting of rocks around the central domain; 7) formation of breccias; 8) proposed evidence of direct K-feldspar melting ; 9) planar elements within minerals; 10) presence of shear zones; 11) presence of ultramafic sills (the Maniitsoq Norite Belt) ; 12) proposed widespread hydrothermal alteration; 13) a coincidence of a zircon U-Pb ages at approximately 2975 million years ago (Ma). The impact was argued to post-date the end of deformation in the Maniitsoq region. The age was subsequently refined to 3000.9 ¬± 1.9 Ma based on mean age of five orthogneiss samples suggested to represent rocks melted and hydrothermally altered by the impact . The proposal was criticised by Reimold et al. for devising new criteria for recognising an impact, because it failed to meet existing criteria. Furthermore, they argued that the structure was not circular, that there was no evidence for shock metamorphism, and no geochemical evidence for an impact . In particular, they demonstrated that Garde et al. had mistaken features commonly found in deformed and metamorphosed terranes, such as migmatites and inclusion trails in quartz, for shock features, such as microbreccias and planar deformation features .  Evidence against an impact  Subsequent studies in the Maniitsoq region demonstrated that deformation in the region continued after the proposed impact age, with major metamorphic and deformation events at ‚àº2.86‚Äì2.70 Ga and ~2.55 Ga . Extensive deformation was noted both near the proposed impact centre and in ultramafic rocks previously suggested to be post-tectonic . Kirkland et al. noted that it was difficult to reconcile the preservation of a circular impact structure and other proposed impact related features with the severe deformation that followed, and instead interpreted the 'impact' features as the result of multiple phases of high-grade metamorphism and partial melting. Further zircon U-Pb dating also contradicts an impact model. The ages of rocks interpreted as impact melts within the impact structure are indistinguishable from the ages of the unaffected rocks from outside the impact structure . This requires that the impact coincidentally occurred at the same time as major (non impact-related) crustal formation in the region, which Gardiner et al. consider unlikely . Furthermore, Gardiner et al. note the presence of a second homogenous body of orthogneiss further east within the Akia Terrane, the Taserssuaq Orthogneiss Complex, which formed at 2982 Ma and contains homogenous gneisses and magnetic anomalies that are very similar to the Finnefjeld Orthogneiss Complex, interpreted to be the centre of the impact structure. This orthogneiss complex is too young to have formed in response to the proposed impact, and demonstrates that similar orthogneiss complexes and magnetic anomalies can be generated without an impact event . Dating of metamorphic zircon and rocks formed during high temperature metamorphism at ~3 Ga, indicate that the metamorphic event lasted for >40 million years, which is too long to have been caused by a single impact . Instead, the metamorphism and deformation is better explained by endogenic (terrestrial) processes, such as stagnant lid processes or an ultra-hot orogenic event . Finally, new dating of the ultramafic intrusions of the Maniitsoq Norite Belt shows that these formed at 3013 Ma, and are therefore too old to have been generated by the impact event . Further evidence against an impact origin comes from analyses of oxygen isotopes within the ultramafic intrusions of the Maniitsoq Norite Belt , which show no evidence of the widespread hydrothermal alteration asserted to have been caused by the impact . This is supported by geochemical and petrographical observations from the same rocks, which show that most rocks were largely dry, with only limited local hydrothermal alteration occurring adjacent to intrusions of much younger granitic rocks . Due to the reasons outlined above, the Maniitsoq Structure is widely believed not to have formed due to a giant impact , and is instead interpreted to reflect terrestrial tectonic processes .

It appears to date to the late Iron Age, and may have been a high-status settlement. The term \\"banjo\\" refers to the shape. It is a round enclosure approached by a straight avenue, with the enclosure and avenue bounded by banks and ditches. The banks have been worn down and the ditches filled in over time, so it is scarcely noticeable from the ground. It showed up on photographs from the air taken in 1930 and 1946. Since then the site has become more overgrown and is hard to detect even from the air. Location The enclosure is on the Walton Down at ST 4289 7377, to the northeast of village of Walton in Gordano. The earthwork banks and ditch were detected from aerial photographs from 1930 and 1946. Since then many of the features have been hidden by encroaching vegetation. The earthworks are obscured by gorse, scrub, brambles and small bushes. They have been affected by ant hills, which often are found on former pastures, and by a rabbit warren from the Middle Ages. Two round Bronze Age barrows were found in a 1931 field survey on Walton Down near to the banjo enclosure. Similar banjo enclosures elsewhere have been dated to the middle and late Iron Age. The enclosure may have been used to hold livestock or for a seasonal pastoral settlement. Earthworks of this form found in Ireland were used as sheep pens. However, recent research suggests that most banjo enclosures were settlement sites, and may have been occupied by people of high status. The enclosure is one of just four that have been noted in Somerset by English Heritage, and is the easiest to see from the ground since the land has not been farmed for many years. It can be accessed by a medieval pathway that crosses the site. Description The enclosure is oval, about along the WSW- ENE axis and along the NNW-SSE axis. It contains an area of about . The enclosure is surrounded by a rampart of limestone blocks, mainly less than high. The inner bank is from wide, with an outer ditch from wide. The ditch is now about deep and the banks now average in height. There are entrances on the south and north east sides, approached by paths between parallel banks. Two parallel banks extend in a WSW-ENE direction from the ENE side. They are both about wide, and are apart. A linear NE-SW earth bank crosses the end of the avenue formed by these bank at right angles, with a gap in the centre. It is about wide and long. The 1946 photograph shows what is probably a bomb crater in the ENE avenue. There is a rhomboidal enclosure about of earth banks and ditches about southwest of the centre of the banjo enclosure, at ST 4295 7373.

He seems to have been a son of Gofraid mac Arailt, King of the Isles, and was likely a member of the U√≠ √çmair kindred. According to mediaeval sources, Lagmann was closely associated with √ìl√°fr Haraldsson, a future King of Norway. According one source, both men lent assistance to Kn√∫tr, son of Sveinn Haraldsson, King of Denmark, although it is possible that this account actually refers to √ìl√°fr's campaigning in England several years beforehand. Lagmann and √ìl√°fr are also recorded to have assisted Richard II, Duke of Normandy. The two are specified to have not only ravaged lands in Brittany on behalf of Richard, but were tasked to counter Richard's opponent Odo II, Count of Chartres. Lagmann's activities on the Continent may have arisen as a result of being forced from the Isles following the death of his possible brother Ragnall mac Gofraid, King of the Isles in 1004 or 1005. Lagmann's son, Amla√≠b, is recorded to have perished at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014. If Lagmann died at about this time as well, it could account for the record of H√°kon Eir√≠ksson assuming control of the Isles. King of the Isles Locations relating to Lagmann's life and times According to the eleventh- century Gesta Normannorum ducum, Kn√∫tr, son of Sveinn Haraldsson, King of Denmark sought military assistance from a king of the Noricorum named √ìl√°fr, and a king of Suauorum named Lacman.Wadden (2015) p. 30; Downham (2014) p. 25; Bagge (2010) p. 296 n. 65; Downham (2007) pp. 132‚Äì133; Hudson (2005) pp. 68, 76‚Äì77, 132; Downham (2004) pp. 60‚Äì61; Abrams (2003) p. 47 n. 20; Hudson (2002) p. 38; Mortensen (2000) pp. 7, 178‚Äì179; Marx (1914) pp. 81‚Äì82 bk. 5 ch. 8. Whilst √ìl√°fr seems to be identical to √ìl√°fr Haraldsson,Crouch (2007) p. 22. there is otherwise no known Swedish king named Lagmann. In fact, Gesta Normannorum ducum appears to refer to a King of the Isles rather than a King of Sweden, with Suauorum likely being a form of Sudrorum.Wadden (2015) p. 30; Downham (2007) pp. 132‚Äì133; Hudson (2005) p. 77; Downham (2004) pp. 60‚Äì61; Wood Breese (1977) p. 59 n. 71.

Rawl. B. 489 (n.d.). The Gaelic personal name Lagmann is derived from the Old Norse l«´gma√∞r (\\"lawman\\"). The latter word originally referred to a profession, and was later adopted as a personal name. Although the name itself is historically found in the Isles as early the tenth century, it is not attested in Scandinavia proper.Downham (2007) p. 133; Downham (2004) p. 61; √ì Corr√°in (1998a) ¬ß 16; √ì Corr√°in (1998b) pp. 308‚Äì309. Corroboration that there was indeed a contemporaneous potentate from the Isles who bore the name is preserved by the fifteenth- to sixteenth- century Annals of Ulster and the eleventh- or twelfth-century Cogad G√°edel re Gallaib. These sources reveal that a prominent Islesmen named Amla√≠b, described as the son of Lagmann mac Gofraid, fought and died at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014.Wadden (2015) p. 30, 30 n. 13; Duffy (2013) ch. 4; The Annals of Ulster (2012) ¬ß 1014.2; The Annals of Ulster (2008) ¬ß 1014.2; Downham (2007) pp. 133, 193 fig.12, 198; Hudson (2005) pp. 77, 98; Downham (2004) p. 61; Jennings (1994) p. 98 n. 58; Todd (1867) pp. 164‚Äì165, 164 n. 10, 206‚Äì207, 271‚Äì272.

The name of Brian B√≥ruma mac Cenn√©tig as it appears on folio 15r of Oxford Bodleian Library Rawlinson B 488 (the Annals of Tigernach): (\\"Brian mac Cend√©idigh\\").The Annals of Tigernach (2010) ¬ß 977.2; Annals of Tigernach (2005) ¬ß 977.2; Bodleian Library MS. Rawl. B. 488 (n.d.). The exact chronology of the events attributed to Lagmann on the Continent is uncertain.Hudson (2005) p. 76; Downham (2004) p. 61. There is reason to suspect that the episode concerning 1014 may be erroneous, and actually refers to √ìl√°fr's otherwise known campaigning with √ûorkell inn h√°vi in 1009‚Äì1011. Certainly, no English source associates √ìl√°fr with Kn√∫tr in 1014,van Houts, EMC (1984) pp. 118‚Äì119. at about the time when the former was active in Scandianvia claiming the Norwegian kingship.Simek (2010); van Houts, EMC (1984) pp. 118‚Äì119. Although it is likewise uncertain who ruled the Isles at about the time of the Battle of Clontarf, it is conceivable that Lagmann held a degree of authority on Mann.Downham (2007) p. 197. The royal title accorded to him by Gesta Normannorum ducum suggests that had ruled in the Kingdom of the Isles, or at least possessed a claim to the kingship.Wadden (2015) p. 30. One possibility is that his actions in England and on the Continent are evidence that he had been exiled from the Isles by this time. Such an expatriation could have come about in the immediate aftermath of the death of Ragnall in 1005. If correct, Brian B√≥ruma mac Cenn√©tig, High King of Ireland could have seized upon Ragnall's demise and forced Lagmann from the Isles in an attempt to wrest control of realm for himself.Downham (2014) p. 23; Downham (2007) p. 197. The fact that the Annals of Ulster describes Brian in 1014 as \\"over-king of the Gaels of Ireland, and of the Foreigners, and of the Britons\\" could be evidence that Brian indeed held authority in the Isles, or at least sought to.Downham (2014) p. 23; The Annals of Ulster (2012) ¬ß 1014.2; The Annals of Ulster (2008) ¬ß 1014.2; Etchingham (2007) p. 160. It is conceivable that such interference could have enticed certain Islesmen to back Sitriuc and the Dubliners against Brian at the Battle of Clontarf that year.Downham (2014) p. 23. The name of H√°kon Eir√≠ksson as it appears on folio 11v of AM 325 II 4to (√Ågrip af N√≥regskonungas«´gum): \\"H«´ÃÅkon\\".Driscoll (2008) pp. 36‚Äì37; AM 325 II 4to (n.d.). H√°kon may have possessed authority in the Isles following the death of Lagmann and his son. If Lagmann and his son died at about the same time, the lack of a suitable native candidate to succeed as King of the Isles may account for the record of the region falling under the control of the Norwegian H√°kon Eir√≠ksson.Hudson (2005) p. 132. Evidence that Kn√∫tr installed H√°kon as overlord of the Isles may be preserved by the twelfth-century √Ågrip af N√≥regskonungas«´gum.Abrams (2007) p. 181 n. 7; Woolf (2007) p. 246; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 196‚Äì198; Hudson (2005) pp. 130‚Äì131; Williams, DGE (1997) pp. 101‚Äì102. The historicity of this event is uncertain, however, and H√°kon's authority in the Isles is not attested by any other source.Driscoll (2008) p. 97 n. 78; Woolf (2007) p. 246; Hudson (2005) pp. 130‚Äì131. If H√°kon had indeed possessed overlordship of the Isles, his eventual demise in 1029 or 1030 may well have paved the way for the rise of Echmarcach mac Ragnaill, King of Dublin and the Isles,Woolf (2007) p. 246. a man who may have been a son of Lagmann's brother,Downham (2007) p. 193 fig. 12; Hudson (2005) p. 130 fig. 4. and who first appears on record in about 1031. The tenth- or eleventh-century Gesta Normannorum alleges that the dukes of Normandy were associated with people variably identified in Latin as the Hibernenses‚Äîa term that ostensibly refers to the Irish.Wadden (2015) pp. 24‚Äì25; Lair (1865) pp. 127, 192, 265, 282, 295. At one point the text claims that Richard II's father, Richard I, Duke of Normandy, enjoyed the military assistance of the Hibernenses.Wadden (2015) p. 25. Although this particular passage purports to describe events in the late tenth-century, it is evident that the source is heavily influenced by the realities of the early eleventh century. Whilst there is no evidence that Richard I had access to Irish support, there is instead reason to suspect that Gesta Normannorum actually refers to the Norse-Gaelic rulers of the Kingdom of the Isles and the Irish Sea region. In fact, it is possible that Richard II's association with Lagmann influenced the passage connecting Richard I with a military alliance with the Hibernenses. In another passage, Gesta Normannorum alleges that Richard I was involved in securing peace between the English and the Hibernenses.Wadden (2015) pp. 25‚Äì27; Lair (1865) p. 295. Certainly, a papal directive of 991 reveals that the English and Normans concluded a peace treaty in which the duke was called upon to resist from aiding the enemies of the English.Wadden (2015) pp. 26‚Äì27. Together, this pact and Gesta Normannorum, may indicate that Richard I was associated with leading figures in the Irish Sea region, such as Lagmann's father and uncle, Maccus mac Arailt. The latter two were actively campaigning in the Irish Sea region in the 970s and 980s.Wadden (2015) pp. 27‚Äì28. As such, Lagmann may have continued his family's cooperation with the dukes of Normandy. Another source that seems to evince military collaboration between the Isles and Normandy is the eleventh-century Historiarum libri quinque. Although the reliability of this chronicle is suspect, it nevertheless relates that Richard II enjoyed an amiable alliance and military assistance from \\"the islands beyond the sea\\",Wadden (2015) p. 31; Abrams (2003) p. 48 n. 28; Anderson (1922) p. 546; Prou (1886) pp. 29‚Äì30 bk 2 ch. 2. and may partly evince links between the Normans and the Irish Sea region.Downham (2004) p. 65 n. 96.

A certifying algorithm is said to be efficient if the combined runtime of the algorithm and a proof checker is slower by at most a constant factor than the best known non-certifying algorithm for the same problem.. The proof produced by a certifying algorithm should be in some sense simpler than the algorithm itself, for otherwise any algorithm could be considered certifying (with its output verified by running the same algorithm again). Sometimes this is formalized by requiring that a verification of the proof take less time than the original algorithm, while for other problems (in particular those for which the solution can be found in linear time) simplicity of the output proof is considered in a less formal sense. For instance, the validity of the output proof may be more apparent to human users than the correctness of the algorithm, or a checker for the proof may be more amenable to formal verification.. Implementations of certifying algorithms that also include a checker for the proof generated by the algorithm may be considered to be more reliable than non-certifying algorithms. For, whenever the algorithm is run, one of three things happens: it produces a correct output (the desired case), it detects a bug in the algorithm or its implication (undesired, but generally preferable to continuing without detecting the bug), or both the algorithm and the checker are faulty in a way that masks the bug and prevents it from being detected (undesired, but unlikely as it depends on the existence of two independent bugs). Examples Many examples of problems with checkable algorithms come from graph theory. For instance, a classical algorithm for testing whether a graph is bipartite would simply output a Boolean value: true if the graph is bipartite, false otherwise. In contrast, a certifying algorithm might output a 2-coloring of the graph in the case that it is bipartite, or a cycle of odd length if it is not. Any graph is bipartite if and only if it can be 2-colored, and non- bipartite if and only if it contains an odd cycle. Both checking whether a 2-coloring is valid and checking whether a given odd-length sequence of vertices is a cycle may be performed more simply than testing bipartiteness. Analogously, it is possible to test whether a given directed graph is acyclic by a certifying algorithm that outputs either a topological order or a directed cycle. It is possible to test whether an undirected graph is a chordal graph by a certifying algorithm that outputs either an elimination ordering (an ordering of all vertices such that, for every vertex, the neighbors that are later in the ordering form a clique) or a chordless cycle. And it is possible to test whether a graph is planar by a certifying algorithm that outputs either a planar embedding or a Kuratowski subgraph. The extended Euclidean algorithm for the greatest common divisor of two integers and is certifying: it outputs three integers (the divisor), , and , such that . This equation can only be true of multiples of the greatest common divisor, so testing that is the greatest common divisor may be performed by checking that divides both and and that this equation is correct.

Early years  Cramer was born in Portland, Connecticut on November 6, 1881. He attended Wesleyan University where he obtained an A.B. degree in 1904, he then entered Harvard Law School, receiving the LL.B. in 1907. Cramer entered the practice of law in New York City, spending three years on the legal staff of a large insurance company. In 1910 he moved to Tacoma, Washington, where, for a time, he engaged in the general practice of law and then served as Deputy Prosecuting Attorney for Pierce County.  Further life  During that time he joined the Washington National Guard as a private, and was commissioned a second lieutenant of cavalry in November 1911. In 1916, while still serving as the deputy county prosecutor, Cramer was called into active service for Mexican border duty. This service concluded, he returned to the prosecuting attorney's office for a brief period before the Guard was again federalized for World War I. First stationed at Camp Greene, North Carolina, Cramer went overseas in January 1918 as a captain with the 41st division. While in France he attended the General Staff College at Langres. Upon his graduation in June 1918 he rejoined the 41st Division as Assistant Chief of Staff. Awarded the Ordre de l'Etoile Noir of France for his World War service, Cramer returned to the United States in July 1919 with the rank of lieutenant colonel. Cramer then resumed his civilian practice in Tacoma for about a year, but in July 1920 accepted a commission as a major in the Judge Advocate General's Department. As a member of the Regular Army he first served as judge advocate of the 3d Division and later the 4th Division at Fort Lewis, Washington. Other assignments took him to West Point as assistant professor of military law-at the United States Military Academy, and to Manila as judge advocate of the Philippine Department. Returning from Manila, General Cramer became chief of the Contracts Division, JAGO, which office he held until he became The Judge Advocate General on December 1, 1941. Called to the Army's top legal post only days before Pearl Harbor, General Cramer presided over the immense expansion of the Judge Advocate General's Department necessitated by World War II. The proportions of this expansion are reflected by corps strengths: there were 190 judge advocates in the Army in 1941. By 1945 there were 2,162. The workload increased tremendously on all fronts, and new areas of endeavor were undertaken. In the field of military justice, alone, more than 82,000 general court-martial records were reviewed. During the war years, General Cramer briefly returned to the practice of his predecessors by serving as co-prosecutor of the German saboteurs who landed in Florida and Long Island by submarine in 1942. He was the first Judge Advocate General to serve in this kind of tribunal since the 1860s. The Army joined with the Department of Justice with General Cramer prosecuting for the Army and Francis Biddle for the Justice Department. After World War II General Cramer retired to private practice in Washington, D.C., but was recalled to active duty in 1946 to act as the United States member of the 11-nation International Military Tribunal for the Far East for disposition of Japanese war crimes, after the resignation of John Patrick Higgins. Upon conclusion of the war crimes trials he returned to his practice. General Cramer died on March 25, 1966, in Washington, D.C.

The current known cause for the disorder is a mutation in the PSMB8 gene or mutations in other closely related genes. The syndrome was first named and classified in March 2010 after four patients were reviewed with similar symptoms. There have been approximately 30 cases reported in the scientific literature as of 2015. Signs and symptoms The symptoms of CANDLE syndrome can manifest themselves in a variety of different ways and combinations related to skin disorders, internal inflammatory responses, and fever-based conditions. The types of outwardly visible conditions involve facies not matching other known disorders, contracture of the joints, and skin lesions appearing across any part of the body. The multiple inflammatory developments include nonspecific lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Other possible conditions are hypertriglyceridemia and lipodystrophy. Other novel mutations resulting in the syndrome have also involved the manifestation of other conditions, such as Sweet's syndrome and pericarditis. Another case in 2015 showcased previously undescribed dental symptoms, such as microdontia and osteopenia of the jaw, along with a general case of diabetes mellitus. Causes The most common known cause of the syndrome are mutations in the Proteasome Subunit, Beta Type, 8 (PSMB8) gene that codes for proteasomes that in turn break down other proteins. This occurs specifically when a mutation causes the homozygous recessive form to emerge. The mutated gene results in proteins not being degraded and oxidative proteins building up in cellular tissues, eventually leading to apoptosis, especially in muscle and fat cells. A study conducted by Brehm et al. in November 2015 discovered additional mutations that can cause CANDLE syndrome, including PSMA3 (encodes Œ±7), PSMB4 (encodes Œ≤7), PSMB9 (encodes Œ≤1i), and the proteasome maturation protein (POMP), with 8 mutations in total between them. An additional unknown mutation type in the original PSMB8 gene was also noted. Diagnosis Treatment Unlike other autoinflammatory disorders, patients with CANDLE do not respond to IL-1 inhibition treatment in order to stop the autoinflammatory response altogether. This suggests that the condition also involves IFN dysregulation. History The category that CANDLE syndrome is a part of, along with related disorders, falls under the banner of proteasome-associated autoinflammatory syndromes (PRAAS). The first one to be described was by Nakajo at Tohoku University in 1939, where he collected symptoms including skin lesions, clubbing of the fingers, and various thickening of heart walls. He termed the collective symptoms Nakajo-Nishimura syndrome (NKJO). Further symptoms were added onto the overall condition from work by Nishimura, with the overall symptoms being similar to CANDLE syndrome. A related syndrome was described by Garg et al. in 2010 and titled Joint contractures, Muscular Atrophy, Microcytic anemia, and Panniculitis-induced Lipodystrophy (JMP) syndrome. The primary differences between the syndromes is the lack of fever in JMP syndrome and the lack of seizures in NKJO syndrome, both of which are present in CANDLE syndrome. Though it has been proposed by Wang et al. that the different syndromes are actually just clinical phenotypic variations of the same syndrome based around different mutations of the PSMB8 gene.

Emigrating to the United States in the late 1840s, he worked as a journalist in Missouri. Karl Ludwig Bernays, ca. 1840. Biography Bernays was born in Mainz, Germany, one of eight children of merchant Klemenz Bernays and his wife Theres Kreuznach (Creizenach). The family was Jewish but converted to Christianity while Bernays was still a child, and he was baptized Ferdinand C√∂lestin Bernays. They moved to Oggersheim, where Bernays attended a Catholic elementary school. He later went to a Protestant school in Frankfurt and went on to graduate from a school in Speyer. Bernays began studying law at the Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich and then transferred to the University of G√∂ttingen. Sometime during his university years, he lost an eye in a duel. He received his doctorate in 1844 from Heidelberg University. Bernays became a journalist for the Deutsch‚ÄìFranz√∂sische Jahrb√ºcher (German‚ÄìFrench Annals), which was published in Paris by Karl Marx and Arnold Ruge. When it folded, he became the editor of its successor, Vorw√§rts! (Forwards). In 1844, the newspaper was suppressed by the French government and Bernays was sent to prison for two months. On his release, he took refuge with fellow journalist Henry Boernstein, whose foster daughter Josephine 'Pepi' Wolf he later married. After the French Revolution of 1848 resulted in the establishment of the French Second Republic, Bernays became an official under the new regime and was sent to Vienna, Austria, as part of a legation. However, when Boernstein decided to emigrate to the United States in 1849, Bernays also decided on emigration, taking ship for St. Louis, Missouri with his family and changing his name to Charles Louis Bernays. A cholera outbreak in St. Louis decided him to settle instead in Highland, Illinois, where he got temporary work as a merchant and brewer, eventually establishing the Highland Brewery. After Boernstein arrived in St. Louis and took over the local German-language newspaper Anzeiger des Westens (\\"Western Reporter\\"), Bernays moved back to St. Louis to work as an editor for the paper. He also wrote for the English-language Missouri Republican. During the 1860 presidential election, Bernays served as secretary of the Missouri Republican Party. He became friendly with President Abraham Lincoln, and in 1861 the president posted him to Zurich, Switzerland, and later Helsinki, Finland, as a consul. Bernays apparently did not enjoy these postings (there were protests over his Jewish background) and returned to the United States to resume work as a journalist. During the Civil War, he served as an army paymaster, with the rank of lieutenant colonel. Around 1870, Bernays withdrew from public life and began to write his autobiography. Due to illness, he left this project unfinished. He died in St. Louis in 1876. Personal life Bernays' wife, Josephine Wolf, was a singer and dancer. They had a daughter, Theresa, whose son, Louis C. Spiering, would be one of the chief architects of the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. References Further reading * \\"Bernays, Charles Louis\\". Gateway.

The site is between the Fresno and Kings‚ÄìTulare stations, roughly east of Laton and north of Hanford. The structure is planned to be over long because three river channels must be crossed, two of which were created by floods in the 1860s. In the vicinity of the crossing, the Kings River consists of three widely separated river channels collectively known as the Kings River Complex. From north to south, these are Cole Slough, Dutch John Cut, and the Old Kings River, all of which flow in a westerly direction. Cole Slough and the Old River separate at the People's Weir, the largest weir in the Kings River system. The Old River was the main course of the river until two floods in 1861 and 1867, the first of which created Cole Slough and the second of which caused it to become the river's new main course. Since then the Old River has been dry except when river flows are exceptionally high. Dutch John Cut diverges from Cole Slough east of the bridge site, and joins the Old River to reform the main channel of the Kings River to the west of the bridge site. Cole Slough is then mostly diverted into several canals in the vicinity of Laton. Dirt excavation sites in the vicinity of the bridge will be reused as groundwater recharge basins once construction is complete.  History  The Kings River Viaduct is part of Construction Package 2‚Äì3, whose contract was awarded to Dragados/Flatiron/Shimmick in December 2014; the bid for the entire Construction Package was $1,234,567,890. The initial April 2014 plans called for an 11,680-foot-long concrete viaduct, with four truss bridge segments for the three river channels and Riverside Ditch. By 2016, during the bidding process the land portions were changed to embankments containing wildlife crossings, reducing the estimated cost by $79 million. At that time construction was expected to commence in spring 2017 and be completed in 2019. As of mid-2019, construction on the first portion of the bridge, the steel truss crossing of the Old Kings River, was scheduled to begin in September that year. However, in December 2019 the project continued to be delayed due to land acquisition, coordinaation with the Fish and Wildlife Service, utility relocation, and a lawsuit from a farmer owning land adjacent to the project. As of mid-2020, the test pile foundation work is now complete. Construction of the substructure is scheduled to begin in mid-October dependent on permit approvals.

At 1:40 AM the master of A. Regina contacted the U.S. Coast Guard and described the vessel's situation, advised that there was no immediate danger, and indicated that it would be best to wait until daylight before having the passengers and crew leave the vessel. A helicopter from Coast Guard Air Station Borinquen was dispatched to the scene. As day broke, using the ship's lifeboats, 143 passengers and 72 crew members landed on Mona Island to await rescue. There were no casualties or serious injuries. At 10:30 AM, the frigate arrived on scene but due to surf conditions Joseph Hewes was unable to use its small boats to transport persons from the beach. Joseph Hewes remained nearby and using its helicopter delivered hot food, soft drinks, and water to the evacuees on Mona Island. Transporting the stranded A. Regina evacuees out of Isla de Mona was delayed due to miscommunication between federal and local government agencies. By late afternoon children, pregnant women and those needing special care were first to be transported out of Mona Island by helicopter. It became apparent, given the limited occupant capacity of the helicopters available, that transporting all the evacuees before nightfall would not be possible. As night set on February 15, 1985, only about half of the evacuees had been transported back to Mayag√ºez, Puerto Rico. Evacuation flights at night were deemed not safe, so food and blankets were brought by helicopter to the remaining evacuees, who had no option but to spend a night on the island reserve. By dawn Saturday, February 16, 1985 helicopters from the Puerto Rico Air National Guard, United States Army, United States Coast Guard and Dominican Air Force were able to pick up the remaining passengers and crew. The last group of evacuees arrived back to Mayag√ºez at 1:15 PM, nearly 36 hours after the grounding. Attempts to re-float the ship were unsuccessful. A. Regina, valued at the time at US$5 million, and the 31 automobiles on board, were considered a total loss. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) published its findings of their investigation in 1986 (NTSB-MAR-86-02) which determined that the master of the ship, Captain Ascenzio Bessone, was responsible for the grounding by failing to ‚Äúmonitor the vessel's progress along the charted course line by plotting navigation fixes so as to detect the vessel's set and drift‚Äù. Also in 1986, based on a review of the Federal and Puerto Rico government response to the A. Regina grounding incident, the NTSB issued a Safety Recommendation calling for the Puerto Rican government to \\"[a]ssist the U.S. Coast Guard in developing a memorandum of understanding concerning responsibilities, communications, and coordination of logistics among the agencies responsible for participating in various search and rescue emergency and nonemergency situations on the Puerto Rican offshore islands\\". The MV A. Regina wrecksite was situated at approximately . Debris and leaked fuel from the MV A. Regina wreck started washing ashore in the Isla de Mona reserve as the vessel rusted and was slowly breaking apart. Environmentalists, concerned that the wreck posed a threat to endangered turtles and other wildlife, advocated for its removal from the reef. In 1988 the United States Congress included a provision in the Water Resources Development Act of 1988 for the removal of the abandoned wreck of A. Regina. The United States government also passed law in which Section 902 of the law provided for the transfer of a Delong Pier Jack-Up Barge Type A to a private entity for use in A. Regina wreck removal effort. In 1990 the wreck of A. Regina was removed and scrapped in situ from the Isla de Mona reef by Titan Maritime Industries, a marine salvage company using the jack-up barge procured from the federal government.

It was the ninth named storm and the second typhoon of the annual typhoon season in 2016. Meteorological history The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) indicated that a tropical depression had formed northwest of Guam at noon on August 17. A few hours later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) quickly issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert and also upgraded the system to a tropical depression with the designation 10W on the same day, based on increased symmetric convection associated with a defined but partially exposed low-level circulation center (LLCC) that was embedded within the southwest monsoon surge. One day later, the JTWC upgraded 10W to a tropical storm via the Dvorak technique, with the winds proved by a recent scatterometer pass. The JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it Mindulle early on August 19, when central convection had become more organized. However, an upper-level low to the north and the predecessor of Tropical Storm Kompasu to the northeast were stifling the development of any poleward outflow. Moving on the eastern edge of a relatively high-latitude monsoon gyre and being steered by the southern extension of the subtropical ridge anchored east of Japan, the intensification of Mindulle was limited on August 20, owing to modest dry air entrainment resulting in flaring convection near and surrounding the LLCC. Although the JMA upgraded Mindulle to a severe tropical storm when it was approximately northwest of Chichi-jima at around 15:00 JST (06:00 UTC) on August 21, outflow from Tropical Storm Lionrock to the west was inhibiting further development and causing a partially exposed LLCC with deep convection displaced southward, as the distance between their centers was only about at that time. With warm sea surface temperatures of between , good equatorward and poleward outflow channels, as well as low vertical wind shear, the JMA upgraded Mindulle to a typhoon at around 03:00 JST on August 22 (18:00 UTC on August 21), when the center was located only about east of Hachij≈ç-jima. At around 12:30 JST (03:30 UTC), Mindulle made landfall over the area near Tateyama, Chiba. Preparations and impact USS Chancellorsville was departing from Yokosuka on August 21 in advanced of Typhoon Mindulle While Mindulle was in its developmental stages, the Guam National Weather Service office issued a tropical storm watch for Tinian and Saipan. On the islands, the storm produced gusty winds and showers. Across the Kant≈ç Plain, about 850,000 people were ordered to evacuate. In Kanagawa and Tokyo prefectures, officials issued landslide watches. On Hokkaido, more than 2,700 people evacuated due to Mindulle. Ahead of the storm, Narita International Airport - Tokyo's main airport - was closed, causing 425 flights to be canceled, affecting tens of thousands of travelers. Hundreds of Japan Railway trains were also canceled. American military bases in Japan were set at Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness (TCCOR) 1, and non-essential people were directed to stay in their lodgings after most services were shut down. The third storm to strike Japan within a week, Mindulle dropped heavy rainfall on Honsh≈´, where the soil was saturated due to rainfall dropped by the earlier tropical storms Chanthu and Kompasu. ≈åme, Tokyo recorded nearly of rainfall. The offshore islands of Hachij≈ç-jima and Izu ≈åshima both reported of precipitation in just one hour, which is about half the average August rainfall for both locations. Shizuoka recorded nearly of rainfall. In the capital city Tokyo, Mindulle dropped of rainfall, which is 66% of the average August rainfall. Narita Airport recorded winds of 126 km/h (78 mph), which forced air traffic controllers to evacuate the control tower. This was the first time the tower was evacuated due to a typhoon, and only the second time in its history after the 2011 Japan earthquake. The island of Miyake-jima recorded winds of , and Yokosuka Naval Base recorded winds of , which restricted outdoor activity. Floods from Mindulle's heavy rainfall submerged a tunnel along the Ch≈´≈ç Expressway in Tokyo. Portions of Naval Air Facility Atsugi, Yokota Air Base, and Camp Zama were flooded, with runways submerged. At Yokota Air Base, the floods cut off power to five housing towers, forcing the occupants to evacuate. Floodwaters covered roads and damaged homes in Hokkaido, and a man drowned in Kitami, days after floods from Kompasu also killed a man on Hokkaido. A woman in Sagamihara outside Tokyo also drowned during the storm. Nationwide, Mindulle's effects injured 61 people. Across southeastern Honshu, 15 rivers flooded, and a train line was washed out in western Tokyo, forcing a train of commuters to evacuate. High winds knocked a tree onto a central Tokyo train station, which suspended service on the Tokyo Loop Line. Fallen power lines left over 100,000 people without power, mostly in Chiba Prefecture. Total financial loss in Japan, along with Tropical Storm Kompasu, were counted to be ¬•45 billion (US$448 million).

History The original house was built by Johan Christian Conradi for custom inspector Jacob Rahbek in the 1750s. The writer Knud Lyhne Rahbek, Jacob Rahbek's son and a central figure in the Danish Golden Age, grew up in the building. Jacob Rahbek sold the property to a merchant named Duncan in about 1670 and built a new house at Store Kongensgade 59 in 1782. Duncan expanded the house with two new wings to the rear in 1783. Custom officer Hans Boye purchased the house in 1795. His wife was the writer Birgitte Cathrine Boye. Baron Carl Frederik Gyllembourg- Ehrensv√§rd (1767‚Äì1815) bought the house in 1812. His wife was the writer Thomasine Christine Gyllembourg-Ehrensv√§rd. She moved when her husband died in 1815. The violinist and composer Claus Schall lived at Fredericiagade 2 from 1825 until 1835. Later residents at Fredericiagade include philosophy professor F. C. Sibbern (1785‚Äì1872). Later Defence Minister P. F. Steinmann lived in the building from 1837 to 1839 and again in 1841. The actor Peter Schram (1819‚Äì1895) lived in te building from 1842 to 1845. The painter and illustrator Lorenz Fr√∏lich lived in the building from 1875 until 1878 after his return to Denmark after many years abroad. In 1908,Isak Gl√ºckstadt acquired the building. He was managing director of Den Danske Landmandsbank (now Danske Bank). In 1909, he renovated the oldest part of the house. The dining room on the second floor and the balcony overlooking Amaliegade date from this renovation. The first expansion of the house from the second half of the 18th century was replaced by a new wing on Amaliegade in the 1910s. The new wing contained a large ball room. The Italian state purchased the building in 1924. It fell into disrepair during World War II and the years that followed. Restoration began in 1981. Interior The Italian state almost completely changed the interiors after acquiring the building in 1924. The only surviving features of note are two frescos painted on canvas. One is by Magnus Berg (1666‚Äì1739) and the other, Galatheas triumf, is by Henrik Krock (1671‚Äì1738).

It included arable land and pasturage, worked by a tenant farmer. The lands were later sold as a farm. The Woolston Manor Farmhouse is a large stone house completed in 1838 that replaced the earlier manor house. It is now a Grade II listed building. Location Woolston Manor is in the Yarlington parish of South Somerset. The farm is in the valley on the southern boundary of the parish. The farm used to be on the outskirts of the village of Lower Woolston. The village has since been reduced to a few houses in the neighbouring parish of North Cadbury. History The manor of Woolston may have originally been the estate of Ufetone that Drew de Montagu held from Robert, Count of Mortain, in 1086. The estate was assessed at more than 3 hides, including 2 ploughlands and a demesne with of meadow and a flock of 66 sheep. A mill was recorded in 1086, but was not mentioned in later records. There are no records of any manor court for Woolston. In 1166 the estate was held by Jordan Gwihaine from Drew de Montagu the Younger. It was passed down through the Gwihaine, Gwyene or Gyan family to Ellen Gyan, who married John Cammell in 1397. In 1565 Sir Henry Cammell sold it to Sir James FitzJames, and in 1568 he sold it to Thomas Chafyn. The Chafyns were a family with large estates in Dorset, Somerset and Wiltshire. The estate was called \\"Great Woolston, otherwise Woolston Gyon\\" in an early 17th century document, presumably after the Gyon family. The Chafyns sold the estate to James Harding of Mere, merchant, in 1746. Some of the Harding family were living on the estate as yeomen in the first quarter of the 19th century. By 1725 the manor was in closes. In 1765 the farm consisted of all of the former manor, including land outside the parish, covering more than . The tenant had to keep sufficient sheep and had to maintain the old barn used for storing barley. In 1794 some of the land was to be improved by converting ploughed fields to pasture. In 1830 Stephen Harding offered the land for sale as a single farm. Joseph Goodenough bought the farm in 1835. The former manor house seems to have been an asymmetrical two-storey building with four bays. Joseph Goodenough rebuilt the house further back from the road between 1835 and 1838. In 1838 the farm covered . A dairyman was employed by the farm in 1851, and a double cottage was used as a dairy in 1858. Goodenough sold it to Thomas Rogers in 1858, who united the lordship to his Yarlington Manor. William Osborne, farmer, was listed as the tenant in 1883. The tenant in 1905 had to provide straw to the landlord, had to maintain the orchard and could not use barbed wire. The farm, but not the lordship, was sold by Virginia Rogers in 1962. Building The house is built of rendered and ashlar-lined local stone. The roof is hipped and covered in Welsh slate. The style is that of a two-storey villa, with each wall divided into three bays. The sash windows have 16 panes, with plain frames. The central doorway has a reeded architrave and a six-panel door with a rectangular fanlight above. There is a low brick wall with Flemish bond north of the house with ashlar copings. The wall is capped with ornamental wrought-iron railings. The house has been divided into two dwellings. It has been a Grade II listed building since 18 March 1986.

Background Coussan's paternal grandfather, G. Louis Coussan, was a professor at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and the dean of the college of education there. His grandmother, Mary B. Coussan, taught for the Lafayette Parish School Board. His father, Dr. George Coussan, a radiologist, quarterbacked the ULL Ragin' Cajuns, when the team played in the Grantland Rice Bowl in Baton Rouge in 1970. His mother, the former Jo Ellen Becnel, is a real estate broker for Van Eaton & Romero in Lafayette. Coussan and his wife, Jennifer Joy, have three children, and attend Our Lady of Fatima Catholic Church in Lafayette.

Pedestrians in Roma outside the Galer√≠a Terreno Bald√≠o Arte History During Aztec times, this area was shallow lake and a number of very small islands. The Aztecs farmed on chinampas, which were small, artificial islands adjacent to firm land. The repeated creation and sinking of these islands over time extended solid land in the area. The most important settlement was Aztacalco (house of herons in Nahuatl) which was located on one of these small islands. After the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, this area was part of the lands granted to Hern√°n Cort√©s by the Spanish Crown in 1529. During much of the colonial period, it was part of the property of the Counts of Miraville, but by the early 20th century, it was the property of two families named Echegaray and Calero Sierra, and bordered the lands of the Hacienda de la Condesa. Although still rural, it was already bordered by streets such as Avenida Chapultepec and Avenida La Piedad (today Avenida Cuauht√©moc) . In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the mostly dried lakebed areas west of Mexico City were being developed into \\"modern\\" colonias for the city's wealthy looking to leave the deteriorating city center. Aztacalco, then called La Romita or La Romerita, was established as a colonia in 1903. At about the same time, the rest of the land which is now Roma, called Hacienda de Romita or Potreros de Romita, was acquired by an investment group called Compan√≠a de Terrenos de la Calzada de Chapultepec. This group included British circus owner Edward Walter Orrin, along with famous clown Ricardo Bell, U.S. engineer Casius Clay Lamm and his sons, and Mexican Pedro Lascur√°in. The intent was to develop the land into a residential subdivision, which was approved by the city government in 1902, with the name of Roma instead of Romita. The project also had participation from the Porfirio D√≠az government, which commissioned itself to provide infrastructure such as roads, water and sewer, and would be the first colonia in Mexico City with these services. The colonia was also designed with wide streets, with tree-filled traffic islands and boulevards such as those in Paris. The names of these new streets came from the states and cities which the Orrin Circus had performed. The largest of these streets was and still is Avenida Alvaro Obregon, originally called Avenida Jalisco. Small parks such as Plaza Rio de Janeiro and Plaza Luis Cabrera were added for more green space. These streets and plazas still remain although a number of the wider streets such as Alvaro Obregon, Durango, Oaxaca, Quer√©taro and San Luis Potos√≠ have been converted into \\"eje\\" or axis roads for through traffic. The project also included the incorporation of the formerly separate La Romita, but residents resisted and the two communities remained socially separate. Hotel Brick, located on the intersection of the streets Orizaba and Tabasco was a hotel which renovated one of La Roma's most famous and beautiful houses. Hotel Brick named its three main suites in honor of this colonia. The suites being \\" Suite La Romita\\" \\" Suite Walter Orrin\\" and \\"Suite Richard Bell.\\" Universidad de la Comunicaci√≥n. After the initial development of infrastructure and some homes, project stalled after the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution in 1910. After the war was over, Roma, along with sister colonias of Colonia Ju√°rez, Colonia Condesa, Colonia San Rafael, Colonia Santa Mar√≠a la Ribera and others, experienced a building boom in the 1920s and 1930s. The architecture in all of these areas at this time rejected Mexico's traditional Baroque architecture of red tezontle stone and wrought iron balconies and window rails for a more modern look, heavily influenced by European trends, especially French, and eventually Art Deco. The colonia was at its most exclusive, considered aristocratic and \\"European,\\" from its beginning to the end of the 1930s, with its historically and architecturally significant buildings constructed between 1906 and 1939. It not only attracted wealthy Mexican families, but also a number of foreign residents the initial British and American developers to a number of French and Spanish. By the 1930s, the colonia has a number of clubs or meeting houses such as La Bandida, where many politicians in Manuel √Åvila Camacho‚Äôs government would meet, and erotic bathhouses such as La Torre. Although two significant churches were built between 1900 and 1940, the Cristero War in the 1930s and its related religious persecutions, resulted in their closing, with services held clandestinely in private homes. In the 1940s and 1950s, the area was still exclusive and could boast of having been the home of influential artists, businessmen and politicians. Residents from the first half of the 20th century included former presidents of Mexico Luis Echeverr√≠a, Jos√© L√≥pez Portillo, √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n and Miguel de la Madrid, as well as Ram√≥n L√≥pez Velarde, Concepci√≥n Acevedo de la Llata\\"Madre Conchita,\\" who was accused of planning Obregon's assassination, Francisco I. Madero‚Äôs widow, Jorge Ibarg√ºengoitia, Fernando Benitez, Juan Jos√© Arreola, Jos√© Agust√≠n, Pita Amor, Julio Sesto, Fernando Solana, Alfonso Garc√≠a Robles, Andr√©s Palca, Mar√≠a Conesa, Pascual Ortiz Rubio, David Alfaro Siqueiros, Enrique B√°tiz Campbell and Leonora Carrington. However, a number of families began to move out when newer exclusive zones such as Polanco, Anzures and Lomas de Chapultepec were built even further to the west. Rents were frozen all over the city during the Second World War, initially as a temporary measure, but this freezing was never lifted until the 1990s. Loss of rental income would eventually led to landlords‚Äô lack of maintenance of older buildings as the decades progressed. By the 1950s, the colonia began to attract lower-class residents due to the low rents. Longtime residents complained about the influx of Arabs, Jews and Mexicans from southern states such as Campeche, Chiapas and Tabasco into the neighborhood. Some areas became dangerous at night. La Romita, due to its socioeconomic segregation was considered very dangerous with organized gang activity by the 1950s. Vagabonds and gang activity in the Plaza Rio de Janeiro area was also a problem by the end of this decade. In the 1960s, older residences began to give way to newer commercial buildings, especially in the northern part of the colonia. Businesses such as General de Gas, Woolworth's, the Mexican Red Cross and Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex) established centers here. By the end of the decade, most of the north, especially along Avenida Chapultepec, was redefined as commercial space. The newer, taller and heavier buildings not only began to change the character of the colonia, they affected the ground around them, causing damage to the older mansions that neighbored them. Serious decline began in the 1970s. More wealthy families moved out as more office buildings were constructed, and Carlos Hank Gonzalez‚Äôs \\"eje\\" road system, made the colonia less isolated from the rest of the city and less exclusive. Men's clubs and prostitution began to appear. The commercial development either destroyed or radically modified the mansions of the early 20th century. One reason for this was that there was little in the way of urban planning or zoning regulations either in this colonia or neighboring ones, so many older homes were either converted into offices and businesses or razed completely to make way for office and apartment buildings. Fuente de Cibeles, replica of the fountain located in the Plaza de Cibeles of Madrid. Gifted to the city in 1980 as a token of friendship between the cities. The deterioration culminated with the 1985 Mexico City earthquake. A geological fracture erupted southwest to northeast thorough the colonias of Colonia Condesa, Colonia Cuauht√©moc, Colonia Guerrero, Colonia Hip√≥dromo Condesa, Colonia Juarez, Colonia Maza, Colonia Morelos, Colonia Peralvillo, the northern part of Colonia Roma and Colonia Tabacalera. In Roma alone, 472 buildings partially or completely collapsed mostly in the northern part of the colonia around Morelia, M√©rida, Cordoba, Puebla, Cuauhtemoc, Insurgentes, San Luis Potos√≠ and Chiapas streets. Most of these buildings were newer, built since the 1950s and many were used for lower class housing, leaving 15,000 homeless. The Conjunto Urbano Benito Ju√°rez, located in the southeast corner of the colonia, was mostly destroyed. The main reasons for the widespread destruction in Roma was that much of it was built on soft former lakebed and much of the newer construction was taller and not as solidly constructed as the older mansions. The widespread destruction and homeless, not only in Roma but in the rest of the city center, created an urgent need for new housing. Destroyed properties were expropriated, and lower class housing was hastily constructed. The cause most of the rest of the older and wealthier residents to leave, and lowered property values greatly. This damage and reconstruction not only cause the flight of the wealthy from Roma, but from neighborhing Colonia Condesa as well, even though it did not suffer significant damage. The effects of this earthquake remain in Roma. As of 2005, there were still fifteen inhabited buildings with serious structural faults at risk of collapse and another 700 considered to be significantly compromised. The most serious decline of the colonia occurred from the 1970s to the early 1990s. The population of the colonia declined from 95,000 inhabitants in 1970 to 35,000 in 1995. Between the commercialization that has been ongoing since the 1960s and the aftermath of the 1985 earthquake, Colonia Roma has lost a large portion of its original structures from the first decades of the 20th century. Due to their size, most of the old mansions became economically unviable as residences, but their central location and proximity to major transportation has made them and the surrounding area valuable for business, pushing owners to want to radically alter or even destroy them. However, the 1985 earthquake spurred not only stricter building codes for new structure, but also neighborhood associations with the aim of conserving and restoring the architectural heritage and prestige of the colonia. These have worked to halt construction of tall apartment and office buildings and to conserve the remaining early 20th century mansions. Neighborhood groups succeeded in having the city's attorney general's office relocated in the mid-1990s as well as nixing the construction of an underground parking garage at the Plaza de las Cibeles. Since 1990, no new apartment buildings have been constructed, although some of the older constructions has been adapted as such. Rents hit bottom just after 1985, attracting artists and urban hipsters into the area. Many of these people were also interested in the restoration and conservation of the old mansions, converting them into office space and other businesses but conserving the original facades. In 1988, city authorities decided to rescue and renovate the La Romita area, especially its church, Santa Mar√≠a de la Natividad de Aztacalco. In the entire colonia, there are still 1,100 mansions from the early 20th century, even though restoration and conservations efforts have had mixed success. One problem is the lack of government maintenance of roadways and another is that private investment into conserving, refurbishing (as offices and businesses) and resale of the buildings has been spotty and sporadic. Today, the best-conserved mansions are along the streets of Colima, Tonal√°, Alvaro Obregon, and Avenida Chapultepec. One of the colonia's successes since the 1990s, has been the opening of a number of art galleries, especially along Colima Street, which was mostly spurred by the establishment of the Casa Lamm Cultural Center. There has been progress into zoning much of the colonia as mixed use (residential/office), with focus on promoting the older mansions as commercial and cultural space. Traffic has been routed around much of the area to keep more residents from moving out. Since 2002, there have been efforts to formally designate and catalogue the historical and architecturally significant structures in order to have even more protections afforded to these buildings.

It was built in 1850. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Eidsvold Homestead established in 1850 by the Archer family, a well-known family of early Queensland pastoralist explorers. It is one of the earliest homesteads in Queensland and one of the first homesteads in the Burnett region. The homestead complex is an agglomeration of many built structures of disparate architectural styles and from different eras is typical of the way in which homesteads evolved. The original slab hut which may date to 1850, is a particularly good example of the earliest type of station housing. It may have been built by the Archers themselves. A \\"second\\" home, forming part of a complex of several buildings commenced in the late nineteenth century, is an example of the housing type that prevailed, at the time, on more established properties in Western Queensland. It has a central core of rooms that opens to wide verandas via French doors. Vine covered trellises extend the veranda roof to provide added shade and coolness. Francis Ivory, a member of the Queensland Legislative Council, resided on the property in this late 19th century home. The first golf known to be played in Queensland involved Francis Ivory and his brother Alexander Ivory, who laid out a few holes on the property in the 1880s. A detached building was erected along this building's eastern veranda between the first and second world wars. It is built in the popular Queensland Bungalow style of the 1920s and 1930s. The property is also significant as the station on which the well-known and successful Santa-Gertrudis breed of cattle was first introduced to Australia in 1955. Finally, the architect-designed 1967 homestead is a product of the more prosperous later years of the station. It is a good example of the work of prominent Queensland-born architect, Guildford Bell.  Description  Eidsvold Homestead today is a complex of buildings set in established gardens. The 1848 slab house is located at the western end of the homestead yard; the complex of buildings which form the second house are situated in the centre; and the 1967 house is at the eastern end. The property is situated on the Burnett River and is approached from the town of Eidsvold via a bridge across this river. The entrance drive sweeps in from the southwest, veering east along the southern perimeter of the main homestead yard and north to the outbuildings. = Slab house = The 1850s slab house, probably built by the Archer brothers, is the earliest house within the homestead yard. It is located adjacent to the south-western end of an early tennis court, which is surfaced with ant bed and enclosed by a high chain-wire fence. The slab building is in an excellent state of repair. It is rectangular in plan with a central core of rooms enclosed by vertical timber slab walls and surrounded by a wide verandah, which is enclosed along all but the south-eastern corner. The central core has a steeply pitched gabled roof while the surrounding verandah has a shallower pitched skillion roof. The house has a corrugated galvanised iron roof but was previously clad with shingles. These are visible on the underside of the roof. At the western end of the house a tank and a small structure which could be a kitchen or wash- house are located outside the verandah edge. The house and verandah have a wooden floor. Internally the house is furnished in the manner of a residence in the latter half of the 19th century. It functions primarily as a house museum. = The second homestead = The second homestead comprises a complex of five buildings, which are located to the west/south-west of the 1967 dwelling. Three of these structures are connected with stairs or covered ways. The buildings exhibit a variety of size, scale and architectural styles, reflecting the development of the complex over a number of years. The core of this complex is a s/1890s house with a steeply pitched hipped roof and stepped surrounding verandahs. The building is rectangular in plan, with its long axis running north-east to south-west. A central core of rooms is roofed with galvanised corrugated iron. The wide verandahs surrounding this central core are separately roofed at a lower pitch. A number of french doors open onto these verandahs. The house is elevated on stumps approximately above ground level. It is open underneath and access is provided via a staircase on the southern corner. Verandah railings are limited to a timber rail at around above the floor level with an infilling of mesh over which a creeper has grown. The house is extensively clothed in a range of creepers climbing over trellises from ground level, particularly on the south-western and north- eastern corners. Also on the south-western corner a vine covered trellis extends from the verandah head beam. This extension of the width of the verandah roof with vine covered trellises was typical of house construction in the latter years of the nineteenth century as residents strove to shade and cool their living areas. Attached to this house along its eastern verandah is a substantial extension elevated a similar height above the ground which appears from its architectural detail to have been built between the first and second world wars. The conjoining of these structures of two distinctly different architectural styles typifies the continuing pragmatic realities of life in the relatively isolated communities of western Queensland's grazing lands This addition is built in the interwar \\"Queensland Bungalow\\" style. Rectangular in plan also, its ridge line runs at right angles to that of the late 19th century house. Again the roof shape is hipped but not at so steep a pitch. An open front verandah runs along the south- western elevation terminated by an enclosed room which runs the full width of the south-eastern elevation. A similar verandah runs along the north-western elevation but this verandah is enclosed with mesh fixed to a timber frame. Both verandahs have separate skillion roofs of galvanised corrugated iron along the full length of the long axis of this extension. A bay window extension fully fenestrated with casement windows is located centrally in the south-eastern elevation. Further sets of casement windows are set one on each side of this bay extension and are shaded by separate sunhoods. The external cladding to this house is chamfer boards. The stumps under are now concrete with decorative scalloped battened sections infilling between the perimeter stumps. Typical of this style of house, gardens are set around the perimeter of the house under the edge of the floor and are partially shaded from the worst of the heat of the sun by the decorative battening between the posts. The vines on the trellises of the colonial house merge with a dense cover of creeper along the north- eastern elevation of the extension. An elevated tank stand is positioned at the southern corner of this house, again with a garden underneath it. The other buildings in this complex are low-set single gable buildings clad with weatherboard and roofed with corrugated galvanised iron sheeting. The larger of these buildings also have extended verandah skillions as part of their roof forms. The first of these buildings, now used as an office, sits to the front of the elevated complex and towards the western corner. It is rectangular in shape and has a moderately pitched open-ended gable roof with the ridge line along a south-east to north-west axis. A lower section of roof is located on the eastern end of the building. A veranda at ground level is located at the opposite corner. It has a substantial flagstone path leading from it. It is not physically connected to the rest of the building complex. To the rear (north-west) of the 19th century house are a further two smaller structures, both aligned south-east to north-west. Both are clad in weatherboards and are gable roofed. A verandah at the southern corner of the larger structure is connected via a covered walkway and stair to the colonial house. There is another small verandah on the opposite (northern) corner of this building. A small simple building, now used as a laundry, is located close to this corner but is detached from the group. The buildings are nestled within a canopy of mature shady trees with extensive shrub and ground cover under-planting. An old bottle tree, Brachychiton rupestre, grows among this vegetation. = The 1967 residence = The 1967 residence is the most easterly of the structures in the complex. It is set behind a semicircular pathway which defines the edge of its front garden. The house is a low set construction, rectangular in plan, raised three steps above ground level and clad with vertical timber planking with a natural finish. This is reminiscent in character of the first slab hut on the property. Ventilation is achieved using floor to ceiling door and window openings, some louvred. The roof is low pitched in a simple open gable form with the ridge running along the length of the rectangular plan. The semicircular pathway in front of the house edges a well maintained lawn area in which is located a raised concrete edged pond. The surface of the pond is covered with a variety of water plants and large ornamental rocks are arranged within the pond. = Ancillary structures = To the west of the main homestead complex there is a line of trees which screens the view to the working structures of the station property from the residential area. These working buildings include a number of older buildings such as stables and yards fenced with slip rail fencing. These are not included within the heritage register boundary. Behind this complex again a line of established shady trees encloses the western boundary of this space. Beyond this are a number of more modern structures, including men's quarters and sheds.  Heritage listing  Eidsvold Homestead was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. As one of the earliest homesteads in Queensland and one of the first homesteads in the Burnett region, the Eidsvold Homestead is important in illustrating the pattern and nature of pastoral settlement in this district. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The homestead complex contains examples of housing from three stages of station development. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The homestead complex has aesthetic importance as a picturesque and rustic place set in a rural environment. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The homestead is associated with the Archer brothers, Francis Ivory, and the introduction of Santa-Gertrudis cattle.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. The historic designation includes a large house (c. 1860), a smaller house (c. 1855), and a barn, all constructed in locally quarried limestone. There are very few agricultural stone buildings in Iowa. with The main house is the most sophisticated of the three. The two-story structure features dressed limestone blocks laid in a random ashlar pattern, a front-gable main block, and a single-story dining/kitchen wing. The older house is a single-story structure composed of rubble stone. The barn's western-most section has a unique cube shape. The O'Hair family acquired the property in the early 1850s and built the smaller house and the first two sections of the barn. Elizabeth Strawn, two times a widow, moved her family to the farm around 1860. She had the large house and the third section of the barn constructed. She moved into Charles City around 1865, and sold the farm to A.W. Cook who remained here until his death in 1887.

The novel details the experiences of two New York City families during the 2008 financial crisis: an immigrant family from Cameroon, the Jonga family, and their wealthy employers, the Edwards family. Plot The novel opens in fall 2007 with the interview of an immigrant from Cameroon, Jende Jonga, who is hoping to be hired as a chauffeur for Clark Edwards, a Lehman Brothers executive. Jonga's job allows him to pay his wife's college tuition and send money back home until the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers threatens both families. Jende Jonga is also seeking permanent residency through a false asylum request. Major themes In Mbue's novel, the immigrant family are discomfited by the transition to a new place, and find themselves changing in response, which was called \\"a fresh take on the immigrant experience\\". =Development= Mbue lost her job in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and was unemployed for a year and a half. She wrote the novel to explain her new understanding that \\"the American dream is not that accessible to everybody\\". Mbue was inspired to write Behold the Dreamers after walking past the Time Warner Center in Columbus Circle, where she noticed black chauffeurs waiting for white executives and wondered about \\"the intersection of their lives\\". Mbue was inspired to become a writer after reading the Toni Morrison novel Song of Solomon, which she had picked up because it was filed on a separate shelf in a Falls Church library after it had been selected for Oprah's Book Club. She wrote the novel over a period of five years without telling friends or family, none of whom read it prior to its publication. In 2014, Mbue signed a million dollar deal with Random House for Behold the Dreamers, which was then titled The Longings of Jende Jonga. Mbue credits a line from the Langston Hughes poem \\"Let America be America Again\\" with inspiring the revised title. =Publication history= * =Technical details= The cover for the first US edition was designed and lettered by Jaya Miceli. Since its initial publication, the novel has been translated into eleven languages. Reception Cristina Henr√≠quez, writing for The New York Times, called it \\"a capacious, big-hearted novel\\" and praised Mbue's writing as suffused \\"with great confidence and warmth\\". Ron Charles, book critic for The Washington Post, wrote that Mbue was \\"a bright and captivating storyteller\\" and said the novel avoided the cliches associated with most immigrant stories: \\"Mbue attains something fresh and insightful here.\\" =Awards= In 2017, she won the PEN/Faulkner Award for this novel.

Strand returns to the compound to help the rest of the group escape the fire, but when Madison sees Nick, he tells her that he couldn't find Travis and he isn't going with them because Celia was right about the group destroying everything in their path, and he no longer wants to be a part of it.

It was the plantation of James Bowie, Rezin P. Bowie, and Stephen Bowie. James \\"Jim\\" Bowie, served in the Battle of the Alamo. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 29, 1987. It was demolished in 2010. with three photos and two maps Today In 2010 Acadia Plantation was demolished and a plaque was placed on Hwy 1 next to Nicholls State University in memory of the plantation. Construction crews worked from the inside out as they dismantled portions of the historic plantation home. The land and home was purchased by Jake Giardina and partner Ron Adams in 2003 from the Plater family as part of a 3,000-acre transaction. The home's future had been a topic of local debate since that time, although there have been no organized attempts to save it. It was listed on the National Register of Historical Places. The 3,400-acre plot of land is now a subdivision which includes a mix of stores, restaurants and homes to the people of Thibodaux. The 132-acres of Acadia Plantation is now developed into residential homes and businesses. The style and arrangement is similar to those found in the New Orleans French Quarter. A grammar school, children museum, doctors office are among the developments of the subdivision. History Acadia Plantation, with its gables, dormer windows, and ornate gallery, was located south of Bayou Lafourche, along the crest of the natural levee. Highway 1 now approximately 50 meters to the north, and Nicholls State University is approximately 500 meters to the west-northwest. The home was owned by Mr. and Mrs. Richard C. Plater, Jr. The house was torn down in 2010. The long history of this plantation was a colorful tale of Louisiana's past. Acadia plantation was first owned by the Bowie brothers, Jim Bowie, Rezin Bowie, and Stephen Bowie who had a lucrative business that involved buying slaves from Jean Lafitte in Galveston, Spanish Texas, and bringing them overland to Opelousas to be sold. Indian trouble made this a dangerous route, however, so in 1819 operations were moved to Bayou Black and Bayou Grand Caillou in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana. In 1825 a spring Mississippi River flood drove the brothers from the parish leaving them in need of new headquarters. In 1828 the brothers began buying several adjoining plantations naming the land Acadia. Separate homes were built only yards apart for Jim, Rezin, and the brothers' mother. On this land the Bowies built Louisiana's first steam-powered sugar mill, although it was unsuccessful and destroyed more cane than it crushed. In 1830 the brothers purchased the back land totaling the size of the plantation to about twenty-one hundred acres. Jim's restlessness soon had him joining the adventure of \\"GTT\\" gone to Texas, where he later became one of the many heroes of the Battle of the Alamo. Stephen Bowie served as Sheriff of Lafourche Parish for a short period, but abandoned the job and Acadia property, returning to Natchez shortly before he died in 1833. Rezin P., struggling with diminishing eyesight, moved to New Orleans with family, where he died in 1841. Brother John Jones, although he married America Watkins, of Terrebonne Parish, at the home in 1831, did not establish their home on the grounds. They first moved to Arkansas, and then to near Natchez. John Jones Bowie, died in 1860, and was buried at Bowie Plantation in Arkansas and America Watkins Bowie, died in 1891, was buried in Natchez, MS. In 1831 Acadia Plantation was sold to Duncan, Robert Walker and James Wilkins. During this time the Union Bank of Louisiana opened a branch in Thibodaux and invited landowners to mortgage their land to buy shares in the bank. The owners of the plantation lost everything to the bank in 1842 because of a depression and two years of crop failure. In 1845 Philip Barton Key, nephew of Francis Scott Key, and mother Anne Plater Key bought the land from the bank. This included all the land of Acadia, the growing crops, every slave, and shares in the bank. He added three other sizable tracts of land to the estate before his death in 1856. The land was then purchased by John Nelson and his son-in-law, Andrew Jackson Donelson, (a nephew of Mrs. Andrew Jackson) until he died in 1858, and the war and postwar years saw several mortgages and lawsuits developed from Nelson's attempts to hold the plantation together. When Acadia was seized in lieu of taxes for 1871 and '72, Edward J. Gay, paid the debt, and operations of the plantation were resumed by Gay and Nelson. When Edward J. Gay died the Prices formed one spacious home by joining the three original homes of Jim, Rezin, and Mrs. Bowie. The Prices also ran the sugar mill on the land from 1850 until 1926, and continued to farm cane. In the late 1900s a dairy farm was set behind the main home and operated until the 1940s. Architecture The main house at Acadia Plantation was locally significant in the area of architecture as a landmark among late nineteenthearly twentieth century residences in Lafourche Parish. The present standing structures at Acadia include a c.1890 frame Queen Anne Revival main house, two contemporaneous cottages, and relatively modern outbuildings. The house had a rambling cruciform plan with ten major rooms on a principal story. Two flights of steps which ascended a full story to an Eastlake gallery. This gallery made a total of four ninety- degree turns as it runs from one side of the house to the other. The main entrance of the house was marked by an oeil-de-boeuf gable supported by two enormous brackets. Each of the Eastlake gallery columns was surmounted by a rounder bracket ornamented with pateras.The complex roof-line consisted of central pyramid with gabled wings coming off all four sides. Each of the principal gables is ornamented with imbricated shingles. At one time they also featured a large oculus and decorative verge boards, but they were removed in the 1930s. Exterior features included the oculus windows at the basement level, the window and door cornices, and shutters, most of which were original to the 1890 period. Also at about that time part of the hall had been enlarged to form a living room and small rear and side extensions were built. Interior layout The layout of inside the plantation was a preliminary archaeological reconnaissance and assessment provided by Richard C. Beavers in August 1983. The library was the part of the house that was originally a shotgun house with a side hall. It was joined together by two other small houses to form the one structure that was the shape of an off-centered cross. The style of the library was a Victorian style. The living room had a Victorian settee, with paneled walls, hard pine floors, and deep molded baseboards. Inside the room was a paneled chimney and mantle. The small guest bedroom was turned into a connection bathroom serving the two guest bedrooms on the west wing of the house. Mr. Plater's office was once a porch and was later enclosed as an office, from the window you can see the bell stand upon which are mounted three bells that are important to the history of the Acadia Plantation. The dining room is a formal dining room built as a connecting wing between the front part of the house and small two-room house owned by Mrs. Bowie. The fireplace has a paneled chimney breast, with slender ionic columns. The kitchen and breakfast room was at one time a pantry and later converted to an informal dining room. This room holds a New England style appearance. The kitchen had been remodeled over the years. Servant's peep hole was provided on the dining room door to prevent accidents and watch for signals when their attention was needed in the dining room. The boys room was another of the single houses joined to form a greater part of the room. The back porch had a view of the cisterns which were the main water supply to the house. The small house to the right was where the cooks lived and other buildings included a carriage shed, stable, hen house, and so on. Further back stood the Acadia Sugar Factory, the boarding house, blacksmith shop, barn, approximately 70 cabins of the Acadia quarters, and finally sugar cane stretched as far as the eye could see. Today,it is no longer. The land has been developed into residential and commercial enterprises, including Thibodaux Regional Hospital.. The old sugar cane industry is no more, but it is and was so much a part of the heritage at Acadia. Furniture and collections The furniture and collections inside the plantation were a preliminary archaeological reconnaissance and assessment provided by Richard C. Beavers in August 1983. In the library was a portrait of Edward George Washington Butler hanging on the wall. He was David Plater's great-great grandfather from Iberville Parish. Several pieces of furniture found in the library and throughout the house were passed down to the family from relatives. Some of these items included corner chair called a roundabout, a set of Staffordshire dogs on the shelves in the library, two tables that flanked the front windows, a sofa with a spindle-back settee of the 1810 era, and a rocker called a comb-back Windsor constructed of pine. A bow-front chest and desk, made of Hepplewhite from New England sat in the corner of the living room. On the mantle was an oil painting of Mrs. Thomas Plater, n√©e Mary Louise Bugg, Mr. Plater, and Jr.'s grandmother. Several chairs, spread about the room, dated to the time the Prices occupied the house. Against the wall was a three-tier table constructed of Chippendale, with claw feet. In the guest bedroom is a massive armoire and swan-neck cradle, a canopy bed made maple from the Sheraton style. Near the mantle is a drop-leaf desk made of pine. In the front of the fireplace was a Windsor rocker. On the mantel sat blue vases which were gifts from Mrs. Price from her sister, Mary Susan Gay Butler. The master bedroom in the corner nearby was a highboy chest that belonged to Plater ancestors of the 1700s. Near the bed stood a sewing table which still held wooden spools. On the chimney, and front wall hung Dawson Watson paintings. In Mr. Plater's office there were several cane-seat captain's chairs from the plantation furniture. A map desk which was equipped with a lighted display surface that enhanced the details on maps. Over the window was a prize possession of a replica of the Bowie knife. In the dining room on the west wall near the door hangs a portrait of Edward J. Gay. To the right of the fireplace hangs a portrait of his wife, Lavinia Hynes Gay. On the back wall is Nellie Curtis Lewis, granddaughter of Martha Washington. Above the fireplace is a painting of Lord Byron. The furniture in this room was the finest antiques in the house. Against the wall was a Maryland sideboard, Sheraton in style. A corner cabinet nearby was made of mahogany and pine. It was 18th century Chippendale and came from the estate of Lord Thomas Fairfax of Virginia. The dining table was designed from two card tables and was Victorian mahogany. The rug on which the dining table and chairs was a turn of the century one. In the kitchen and breakfast area, most of the furniture originated from New England. Against the back wall was a dresser with knife slots along the front edge of the shelves. On the left was antique clocks, below on the old pastry table and a child's toy wood-burning stove. One the east wall were two Clementine Hunter paintings entitled \\"The Nativity- Mary with child\\" and \\"Washday\\". On the east wall was a very old table with a drawing by David and Sheela Plater's son, Chris. In the boy's room was a twin four-poster bed that belonged to Mr. and Mrs. Richard Plater's mother. A chest in the corner near the door was from the 1820s. A print over the mantle was of George and Martha Washington entitled \\"Courtship. The furniture in the guest bedroom was all striped maple, late eighteenth century. The bed was turned wooden post and broken scroll pediment of the headboard. A canopy was attached to the four posts. Near the bed on the right, a small wash stand that was used as a bed-side table. In the corner is a drop-leaf desk on which were two carved boats of Nicaraguan mahogany. Above the desk and hanging from picture frame molding was an old map of the Mississippi River. A painting by the impressionist Jean Baptiste Corot hung above a bookcase. Over the fireplace was another Dawson Watson painting depicting a haystack in a field.The blue vases on the mantle were made in Italy, and Windsor chair sat near the bed.

Biography  Koroluck was born in Leningrad in 1933. He was passionate about art since his early years, attended Tavricheskaya Art School classes along with studying in local school and later entered the Department of Monumental and Decorative Sculpture at Vera Mukhina Higher School of Art and Design. He graduated in 1961 and was accepted into Artists' Union of the USSR in the mid-1960s. His early sculpture works include numerous monuments devoted to Great Patriotic War heroes and Soviet political and public figures, among the latter there are bas-reliefs for Saint Petersburg Metro underground platforms and sculptural decorations of Soviet nuclear- powered icebreakers Arktika and Sibir and space control-monitoring ships Kosmonavt Yuri Gagarin and Marshal Nedelin. But his artistic career was severally influenced by two injuries: he lost his legs in a tramcar accident and an accident during sculpting. Reduced mobility encouraged him to design small objects ‚Äî medals and plaquettes. His first designs were presented at \\"Leningrad\\" zonal art exhibition in 1964 and brought him professional recognition. Throughout the following years he designed over 100 medals and plaquettes devoted to notable historical events, workers of culture and science. Koroluck's medals and plaquettes were presented on numerous Soviet and international exhibitions including FIDEM congresses in Prague (1970), Krak√≥w (1975), Budapest (1977), London (1992), Neuch√¢tel (1996) and Berlin (2000). The medal designed for Pasteur Institute received high praise from Monnaie de Paris in 1972 and was sent to Soviet space station Salyut 7 ten years later with an international crew of Soviet and French cosmonauts. As a respected medallist Koroluck taught younger artists and worked on the community of medallists and collectors. In recognition of his contribution he was unanimously elected as president of Leningrad medal club, created in 1990.

It is located in the Santo Cristo neighborhood near the Gamboa waterfront area of the city. It was designed by L√∫cio Costa (1902-1998) in 1931 during his three-year partnership with Gregori Warchavchik, and completed in 1933. The goal of modernists in Brazil was to build for the working class, and Vila Oper√°ria Gamboa is the first modernist building constructed for the poor in Brazil. Vila Oper√°ria da Gamboa was built on a narrow, irregular parcel of land. It is located on the north side of Rua Bar√£o da Gamboa at the intersection of Rua Cardoso Marinho on land ceded to the project by Dr. F√°bio Carneiro de Mendo√ßa. The technology for modern construction was at an early stage in Brazil and workers in Rio de Janeiro lacked the technical skills to work with concrete, steel, and stone. Warchavchik brought workers from his modernist projects in S√£o Paulo to complete the building. The structure consists of fourteen units on two floor. Twelve were full apartments of with a living room and two bedrooms. Two were simple studio apartments of , and were meant to serve as homes for the \\"concierges\\" or janitors of the building. The fa√ßade of the building was painted in vivid green and tan with the walkway banister painted in white. In its style it resembles early 20th-century residences of Louis Bourgeois and Cliff May. Vila Oper√°ria da Gamboa remains standing but is in a state of advanced dilapidation. It is a listed building of the City of Rio de Janeiro (Bens Tombados No Munic√≠pio Do Rio De Janeiro), designated as such in 1986.

The episode was written by Alan DiFiore, and was directed by Allan Kroeker. Plot Opening quote: \\"To kill Koschei the Deathless, first you must find his soul, which is hidden in an egg, in a duck in a lead chest buried beneath an oak tree.\\" Juliette (Bitsie Tulloch) receives a call from a friend, Alicia (Alicia Lagano), who states that her husband has been abusing her. She tells her to come to Portland to discuss her marriage. While staying in the house, Nick sees that she is a Fuchsbau. In Vienna, Adalind (Claire Coffee) meets with Renard (Sasha Roiz), where he demands to know who is the father. She does not tell him but he warns her that her people are only interested in the baby and not to trust anyone. Back in Portland, a healer named Boris Myshkin (Mark Ivanir) heals a woman from a pain she has been suffering. He then attends a Russian party where everyone is celebrating his actions for saving lives. He is attacked by a man named Alex Renko (Vladimir Tevlovski) and he woges into a transparent Wesen with green veins and uses them to poison Renko. Renko manages to escape but upon arriving at his hotel room, he begins to experience pain for the cumulative poison inside his body. Meanwhile, Hank (Russell Hornsby) has his final therapy with his physiotherapist, Zuri Ellis (Sharon Leal). He asks her on a date but she declines, wanting to keep things \\"professional\\". Renard returns to Portland and tells Nick that they may be a threat for the Verrat. Nick, Hank and Wu (Reggie Lee) are sent to investigate a body found in the freezer of a restaurant. The body is identified as Ivan Markov, a waiter, and they find the scene of the fight between Boris and Renko. Nick, Hank and Renard decide to visit Boris as the footage shows that he acted like the attack never happened. They watch as Boris heals a boy and Nick sees his transparent hand and bones in the process. Using his Russian lessons, Renard tells Boris and his wife, Olga (Aleksandra Kaniak) that they can be trusted and offers to put a patrol on their house. Nick then tells them about what he saw and Renard deduces that Boris is a Koschie and decides to call people in Moscow that are expert on it. Along with Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell), Nick and Hank look in the trailer and find that Joseph Stalin used Wesen as bodyguards and Grigori Rasputin was a Koschie too. The diaries also reveal that these species are difficult to kill. Meanwhile, Renard finds out from an informant in Moscow that Boris was an assassin for the Federal Security Service and that everyone died from radioactive poisoning. Renko's condition is notified and Nick, Hank and Wu inspect the room. They find Markov's uniform and deduce that he can be connected to Boris. As they were close to him, the three of them must have a shower. With the crowded evidence, Nick, Hank and Renard take Boris to the station. When he knows that Nick is a Grimm, he confesses that he attacked Renko in self-defense. They suggest that he leave the country as someone else will be sent to kill him and he agrees. At his home, he begins to make out with his maid, Larissa (Angela Gots) while drinking a vodka. She then pushes him when she finds that he didn't die. She has poisoned him as he killed her father and brother. She stabs Boris but, as she is leaving, Olga slits her throat just as Nick, Hank and Renard arrive. Larissa's wounds are grave but Boris decides to use his powers to heal her and dies doing it. Nick returns home with Juliette and Alicia and they receive a call from Joe, Alicia's husband. Nick and Juliette deny that she is with them but it's revealed that he is parked outside their house, and woges into a Klaustreich.

The A.V. Club's Kevin McFarland gave the episode a \\"B\\" grade and wrote, \\"The last thing Grimm needs to add is more subplots. I haven't wondered at any point this season whether there should be more going on in the show, that the story feels too thin, or that there aren't enough characters across the Wesen world that seems to only consist of Portland and Vienna. But 'Red Menace' kicks of Grimms 2014 by heaping on another multi-episode arc, where Juliette's longtime friend ‚Äî who's never been seen or heard from before ‚Äî Alicia finally leaves her violently abusive husband, and decamps to Portland.\\" Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 3.3 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"Grimm was ready to ring in the new year with Grimm Season 3 Episode 9. But this installment, while having an interesting premise, ended up falling mostly flat.\\" MaryAnn Sleasman from TV.com, wrote, \\"All in all, Grimms post-holiday return wasn't bad ‚Äî it was just sort of rudimentary. We had our Wesen-of-the-week and the attached minor lesson about forgiveness. We hit, however briefly, on the strings left dangling at the end of the mid-season finale: Nick still has zombie powers, Adalind is still in Vienna; it's like someone ticked the plot points off of a checklist. I wanted more, but there's still a whole bunch of episodes left in this season to give us more. It's okay ‚Äî I'll wait.\\" References External links Grimm (season 3) episodes 2014 American television episodes ","title":"Red Menace (Grimm)"},{"id":"51387523","text":"Gayndah State School is a heritage-listed state school at 33 Meson Street, Gayndah, North Burnett Region, Queensland, Australia. It was built from 1861 to 1862. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Construction of the National School at Gayndah was commenced in 1861 after members of the Gayndah community submitted designs for a primary school to the Board of General Education in 1860 which were approved and was granted towards the cost of construction. The building was completed in 1862 and the first schoolmaster, Hercules Smith, took up duties in September 1863. The school opened in November 1873. Gazetted in 1849, the town of Gayndah initially developed as the centre for a number of large sheep stations taken up in the Burnett region during the 1840s. Gayndah's early growth as a pastoral \\"capital\\" is largely attributed to the determination of the squatters and the town developed as the administrative centre for the area, as the school was established in 1861, and post office and court house were erected. A branch of the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney was opened in 1864, and a local government authority, Borough of Gayndah, was established in 1867. By the late nineteenth century, cattle had replaced sheep as the dominant pastoral activity. Citrus orchards also flourished, and together with cattle and dairy farming, provided the basis for the development of Gayndah from the turn of the century. National Schools were established by the Governor of New South Wales, Charles Augustus FitzRoy, in 1848 at which time he appointed a Board of National Education to undertake the task of creating a system of government schools similar to the National School system in Ireland. When Queensland separated in 1859, it inherited two national schools in Warwick (1850) and Drayton (1851). Following separation, the Queensland Government passed The Education Act of 1860 to establish a Board of General Education to oversee the administration of National Schools throughout the new Colony of Queensland. Two new National Schools were constructed in 1860 (two in Brisbane, Brisbane Boys and Brisbane Girls); seven new National Schools were opened in 1861, four more in 1862 and three in 1863. The regulations which required local communities to raise one-third of the costs were relaxed and fifteen new schools opened in 1864. However, the 1866 fiscal crisis temporarily retarded the construction of additional schools. The Gayndah National School was established at a time of heightened growth in the establishment of schools throughout the Colony. National Schools remained the dominant form of government primary schools until 1875 when major reforms in education were put in place throughout Queensland. Construction of National Schools was regulated by government standard and local communities could apply to the Board of Education for an approved school plan or, as in the case of Gayndah, they could supply their own design for approval in accordance with the following recommendations. School rooms had to be at least wide and where attendance would exceed 20 students, the width was to be . The recommendations also provided for teachers residences which were to contain four rooms and a kitchen. The original school building at Gayndah consisted of a brick schoolroom, , with an adjoining infants' classroom , under the same roof with a dividing wall towards the southern end. A verandah extended along the eastern side of the building, and there were three dormer windows in the roof above the level of the verandah roof. On the north elevation underneath the gable (facing the street) the date 1861 was inscribed. Attached to the schoolroom on the western side was a residence for the teacher which included four rooms, (two bedrooms, a sitting room and dining room) and a kitchen, as prescribed by the regulations at the time. The school building has been greatly modified, although it still displays significant aspects of its original design. The original school room is still in place with evidence of the removal of the dividing wall that sectioned off the infants' classroom. The decorative fascia boards on the northern elevation and two of the three original dormer windows on the eastern elevation are still intact. The dormer window towards the northern end has been enclosed to accommodate extensions on the eastern elevation, where the original verandah has also been altered. The teacher's residence has been demolished apart from a single room, originally a bedroom, which adjoins the school room at the northern end and is used as a store room. The building's external walls, originally face brickwork, have been painted white. The original brick building was gradually developed around as the school grew over the ensuing century. The other buildings on site are mostly of timber construction, more typical of Queensland school development than the original brick construction which was always more unusual in Queensland. The original school building is still in use as a music room, resource centre and classroom and forms a working part of the Gayndah school complex.  Description  The Gayndah State School is situated on the southern side of Messon Street, the main street in Gayndah. The school is a complex of six buildings from varying periods and is characterised by its well established grounds with mature plantings. Entrance to the school is gained from Messon Street via a decorative wrought iron gate commemorating the centenary of the school reading \\"Centenary: 1863 - 1963\\". The original masonry school building is located at the western end of the school site and forms only a small part of the total school complex. This building is superficially joined to an adjacent timber building its eastern side by a covered walkway. The building is single-storeyed and comprises a central-gabled core running north/south with three attached wings, one extending to the west from front (northern) elevation (the original teachers bedroom), one extending east from the front elevation (a later addition) and one extending east from the corner of the rear elevation (also a later addition). The eastern elevation of the building creates a U-shaped courtyard incorporating part of the original verandah. The building is constructed basically of brick with some weatherboard included on the eastern additions and has a corrugated iron roof. The northern elevation is characterised by the facade of the gabled- core which displays a decorative scalloped valance along the facia board, an inscription in relief which reads \\"Erected AD 1861\\" and a large multi-paned window with a corrugated iron hood. The same fenestration is repeated on the southern elevation of the central core. The eastern elevation is characterised by the two original dormer windows in the roof which remain visible and the chamfered timber verandah posts which support the awning of the remaining portion of the original verandah. From the verandah two original double timber doors with glass panels gain entrance into the school room. Both are surmounted by two four-paned fanlights. The interior of the central core was the original school room and is an open-plan rectangular space with a high coved timber ceiling featuring large supporting timber cross-beams. There is evidence of an internal wall having been removed at some stage. Two large multi-paned windows feature at either end of the room and internally the third dormer window can be seen towards the northern end of the room, however it is built over externally. The floor is carpeted and the masonry wall are rendered and painted internally. There are two doors which open to the southern side of the building, one to the front porch on the northern side and one to the rear. The rest of the school complex extends to the east of the original school building with the main part of the school being formed by two separate elongated timber structures running parallel creating a central recreational garden area. There is a tuck-shop building and a classroom wing to the rear of the original building and a library wing at the most easterly end of the site.  Heritage listing  Gayndah State School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The original masonry school building at the Gayndah State School is important in demonstrating the evolution of Queensland's history as it was one of the earliest National Schools to be established in the new Colony of Queensland in 1861. The National Schools reflect the instigation and development of secular education throughout Queensland, a system which was adopted from Ireland by the New South Wales government in 1848 and carried over by the Queensland Government after separation in 1859. The implementation of secular education throughout Queensland was a significant advancement in social thinking at the time, rapidly progressing the facility for schooling in Queensland and laying the ground for the subsequent system of state education in place today. Subsequent buildings in the school grounds are also historically significant as they illustrate the evolution of school design demonstrating architectural styles from the Federation, Post-war and late 20th - century periods. The continuation of development at Gayndah State School also reflects the continued viability of the school since 1861. The school also demonstrates the establishment of Gayndah as an administrative centre for the surrounding pastoral region during the 1860s. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Gayndah State School is significant as a rare example of one of the earliest government schools in Queensland. The 1861 building at Gayndah State School is one of only a few government school buildings surviving from the 1860s and is the oldest government school building still in continuous use in Queensland. It is also a rare example of a masonry school building from this period. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The 1861 building is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a National School from the 1860s as it reflects the recommendations for construction which the Board of General Education in Queensland had put in place in order to regulate the standard of school buildings being erected throughout the Colony. The school as a complex also demonstrates typical characteristics of a Queensland State School which has developed over a lengthy time period such as standard timber buildings and tree plantings. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Gayndah State School is aesthetically significant as a well established school site that contributes to the streetscape of Messon Street, the main street in Gayndah, with mature trees and plantings in substantial grounds, buildings of varying styles which complement each other and a decorative commemorative entrance gate presenting a strong external visual presence. The original 1861 building is highly aesthetically significant as a picturesque masonry building displaying quality materials and workmanship in the Victorian Rustic Gothic style. In particular the scalloped valance on the front gable, the dormer windows, the steeply pitched roof and the compact nature of this building all contribute highly to its aesthetic significance. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Gayndah State School has a strong association with past, present and futures members of the school community and the local community of Gayndah as a place of education and as a community focal point since 1861.

It was designed by Queensland Department of Public Works and built in 1928. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 January 1995.  History  =Local= Located in the business centre of Gayndah, the Court House was erected in 1928, and replaced an earlier brick court house building located approximately half a mile from the present court house. The court house was designed in the office of the Department of Public Works; Andrew Baxter Leven was Government Architect at the time. Gazetted in 1849, the town of Gayndah initially developed as the centre for a number of large sheep stations taken up in the Burnett region during the 1840s. Gayndah's early growth as a pastoral \\"capital\\" is largely attributed to the determination of the squatters, and for a short time, the town reputedly rivalled Brisbane as the capital for Queensland.

A branch of the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney was opened in 1864, and a local government authority (Borough of Gayndah) was established in 1867. By the late nineteenth century, cattle had replaced sheep as the dominant pastoral activity. Citrus orchards also flourished, and together with cattle and dairy farming, provided the basis for the development of Gayndah from the turn of the century. =Building= The earliest official building records for the former court house refer to the addition of a verandah in 1861. The former court house, erected probably during the 1850s, and police buildings were located on a site adjoining the former hospital grounds east of the town centre. By the mid 1910s, the court house facilities were insufficient, and inconveniently situated away from the central business area, and the erection of a new building was proposed. Although an allotment fronting Capper Street, in the centre of town, was reserved by the Queensland Government in 1922 as a suitable site for a court house, and preliminary plans were drawn the following year, it was not until 1927 that the final plans for the new building were prepared. Court house, as completed in October 1928 The building was completed in October 1928. The new building was occupied early in 1929, and provided accommodation for Court business, the Police Magistrates, the Land Commissioner and Land Rangers, the Clerk of Petty Sessions and public offices, the Dairy Inspector, the Agricultural Bank and storeroom facilities. The plan of the building with the offices located at the front, closest to the street, and the court room at the rear, is a variation of the more usual arrangement found in timber court houses, where the court room is at the front and the offices are at the rear of the building. A laboratory was added to the northern end of the office (front) section of the building in 1944, for the newly appointed Research Officer from the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock. Buildings at the rear of the court house included an Agriculture and Stock storage shed, a Citrus Budwood shed (as part of the Citrus Budwood and Seed Distribution Scheme), a garage and earth closets. Despite proposals during the mid 1960s, to remove the court house to a site in Pineapple Street adjacent to the police station (erected in 1935), in order to construct a swimming pool on the court house site, the court house remains in its central location.  Description  Situated in Capper Street, the main street of Gayndah, the Court House is a single-storeyed timber building with a hipped corrugated-iron roof and two projecting gables. A verandah runs along the front of the building between the gables. The gables have bell-cast timber-boarded sun hoods over the windows. The large central ventilator on the roof is the dominant decorative element of the building. The exterior of the court house is reasonably intact, except for metal louvres enclosing the verandahs. The Court House is set back from the footpath, and punctuates the streetscape which is composed of shops with verandahs supported on posts over the footpath Gayndah Court House is a typical example of the work of the Public Works Department and is a continuation of the tradition of timber court houses in Queensland country towns, adapting to civic function vernacular elements and materials common to domestic buildings. The building has a T-shaped plan, with offices along the front and the court room at the rear. The grounds of the court house contain a number of bottle-trees, Brachychiton spp. Other important buildings in the town precinct include the two timber banks, the two hotels and the Shire Offices.  Heritage listing  The Gayndah Court House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 January 1995 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Erected in 1928, to replace a court house dating probably from the 1850s, the Gayndah Court House survives as an important illustration of the pattern of Gayndah's development as an official and commercial centre for the Burnett district of Queensland. The prominent central location of the court house in Gayndah, also demonstrates the importance of the court house and its associated offices within the town. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Gayndah Court House is a good example of a timber court house in a provincial centre. It reflects the high standard of Government buildings in Queensland, designed by the Department of Public Works during the early-mid 20th century. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Through form, scale and materials, the Gayndah Court House contributes to the Capper Street streetscape and Gayndah townscape. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The prominent central location of the court house in Gayndah, also demonstrates the importance of the court house and its associated offices within the town.

After redshirting his first year he joined the Cardinals and helped them to their first title game in 1986 as well as a national title the following year. Though the championship was later vacated Barnett had already embarked on his professional career. After two years as a minor-leaguer (mostly for the ECHL's Erie Panthers) Barnett retired as a player and began his coaching career. Barnett's first gig came with Mercyhurst as both an assistant coach and director of the Mercyhurst Ice Center. After two years he transitioned to Division I Kent State, again as an assistant, before being hired by Findlay as the program's first head coach. The Oilers started as a Division II program in 1996, playing as an independent squad for two years before joining the MCHA as a founding member and winning the first conference title in 1998‚Äì99 with a 23‚Äì5 record. After their first successful season Findlay was a surprise addition to the premier lineup of College Hockey America when it began play in 1999 not the least due to the fact that the NCAA mandates a 9-year waiting period for teams playing in divisions above their level. Regardless of the trouble Barnett soldiered on behind the Findlay bench, finishing with poor but respectable results each year. While the Oilers were automatic qualifiers for the conference tournament each year (as all member teams were) he failed in each of his four attempts to win a single game, losing in the quarterfinal round each time. In the summer of 2003 the University of Findlay administration changed and consequently, after eight years in Findlay, Craig Barnett resigned as coach to take over at Lake Forest Academy. Anyone left wondering why he resigned had their answer the following January when the school announced the program would revert to club status. Barnett spent only one year in Lake Forest before returning to the college ranks, this time as the Athletic Director for Becker College. Two years later he returned to his old stomping grounds in Erie, Pennsylvania as the AD for Mercyhurst. in 2011 he assumed the role as commissioner of the American Lacrosse Conference, remaining with the league until it was absorbed by the Big Ten in 2014. During his time with the ALC Barnett was tabbed by the North American Hockey League as coordinator of player personnel for both the NA3HL and NAPHL eventually working up to become director of player personnel for the NAHL. Barnett also returned to coaching in 2013, accepting the job at Cathedral Prep (with whom he won a state title in 2015) and three years later became the commissioner of the entire state ice hockey league. Barnett has also served as commissioner of the Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association since 2014.

It was built in 1922. It is also known as Overells. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 8 August 1994.  History  This single-storeyed building was completed by 1922 for Overells Pty Ltd, and replaced a previous building which had been destroyed by fire in May 1921. Gazetted in 1849, the town of Gayndah initially developed as the centre for a number of large sheep stations taken up in the Burnett region during the 1840s. Gayndah's early growth as a pastoral \\"capital\\" is largely attributed to the determination of the squatters, and for a short time, the town reputedly rivalled Brisbane as the capital for Queensland. Gayndah also developed as the administrative centre for the area, as Gayndah State School was established in 1861, and post office and court house were erected. A branch of the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney was opened in 1864, and a local government authority (Borough of Gayndah) was established in 1867. By the late nineteenth century, cattle had replaced sheep as the dominant pastoral activity. Citrus orchards also flourished, and together with cattle and dairy farming, provided the basis for the development of Gayndah from the turn of the century. The land on which the shop stands was acquired by Andrew Brown of Gayndah in 1858, then by Francis Brown in 1864. The titles documents describe Francis Brown as a storekeeper of Gayndah, and include mention of houses and buildings, possibly referring to a shop on this site. Following Francis' death in 1910, the land was acquired by Martin Conrad Stephenson of Gayndah in 1911. Stephenson is listed in directories as a store manager. The land was acquired by William Henry Williams, a Maryborough merchant in 1911. It is likely that Overells leased the shop from Williams at around this time, as they are recorded as having premises in Gayndah from . Photographic evidence indicates that the building was divided into two; one half occupied by Overells and the other half by Ford's Cash Store. Between May and July 1921, three separate fires in the main street of Gayndah destroyed a total of nine shops, including the Overells and Fords building. Overells suffered a loss of approximately . Shortly after the fire, Overells purchased the site of the former shop, and had commenced rebuilding their shop by August 1921, when it was noted that the new premises \\"will be an imposing structure when completed\\". Overells established in Brisbane in the early 1880s, when William James Overell moved to Brisbane from Tasmania. Overell opened a store in Fortitude Valley in 1883, and a store in Queen Street in 1891. The floods of 1893 destroyed the entire stock in the Queen Street store. The store in Fortitude Valley was removed to the corner of Brunswick and Wickham Streets , and was completely destroyed by fire in 1904. The store was rebuilt the following year. By 1910, Overells had established a number of country branches, which included Charleville, Laidley and Pittsworth. The new Gayndah store was completed in early 1922. The recollection of a former employee of Overells, describes the re-opening of the shop as a gala day for old Gayndah. In June 1933, all Overells stores held a 50th anniversary sale. Ownership of the site was transferred to Rothberg & Co Pty Ltd in 1937, then Ronald and Edna Beaton in 1943. Ronald Beaton is listed in directories as a Gayndah storekeeper. In 1954, Cedric Mellor, of the firm Reddan and Mellor, took out a ten-year lease on the shop. Reddan and Mellor, General Drapers and Boot and Shoe Warehousemen, had been established in 1886 at Bundaberg, by Michael Reddan and William Mellor (Cedric's father). Although Cedric Mellor moved to Gayndah in 1954, Reddan and Mellor of Bundaberg continued to trade under both names, finally closing in 1985. Mellors Pty Ltd purchased the Gayndah shop in 1963, and John Mellor, grandson of William Mellor, has been Managing Director of the business since 1973. The rear of the building was extended during the 1960s.  Description  Footpath view showing claim about the \\"flying fox\\", 2008 Prominently located on the main street in Gayndah, Mellors Drapery is a single storeyed rectangular structure of concrete and timber with a corrugated iron roof. The street facade, which faces approximately north northeast, is symmetrically arranged. It consists of a skillion roofed footpath awning supported by five timber posts, a glazed shopfront below the awning and a decorative parapet wall above. A flat ceiling lines the underside of the awning. The decorative parapet, shaped to conceal the roof behind, consists of two peripheral bays and a central bay. The junctions between each of these bays is marked by an implied pilaster which protrudes above the remainder of the parapet. The lower peripheral bays slope up to a raised central bay; a rectangular panel which carries the name of the store. Mouldings are used to emphasise the composition. With the exception of the shopfront the external walls of the building are massive reinforced concrete, cast in situ. The timber framed roof which terminates as a gable behind the parapet wall is hipped at the southerly end. A hipped roofed lantern is located on the ridge of the roof. The shop front consists of three large display windows separated by two recessed entries. A strip of obscure fixed glass above the display windows lets light into the interior of the store. Each entry is fitted with a set of double timber doors and opens directly onto the interior of the shop. The interior, a single large space, is divided along its central axis by a row of large timber posts supporting a timber beam which run from the front to the rear of the store. Male oriented departments are located to the east and female to the west of the axis. High level windows run along the upper part of the side wall which faces east southeast; the opposite wall has no window openings. Connecting the service areas on the easterly and westerly sides of the store with an elevated cash desk is a suspended wire system. The cash desk is located on the central axis near the rear of the store. An ornate metal and timber cash carrier known as a \\"flying fox\\" transports change between the service areas and the cash desk via this system of taut wires. The entire space has a flat panelled fibrous cement ceiling with timber cover strips. Some panels feature lattice vents and pressed metal ceiling roses. A large skylight positioned on the axis between two posts illuminates the centre of the space. The sides of the skylight, lined similarly to the ceiling, slope inwards towards the top and terminate in the windows of the roof lantern. The timber framed pine floor is covered in carpet squares. The store retains many original timber shop fittings, including shelving units, timber counters and display cabinets. A skillion roofed extension, timber framed and clad in fibrous cement, has been built onto the back of the store near the south west corner. A set of timber double doors, centrally located in the rear wall behind the cash desk, open onto an external flight of concrete steps leading to the back yard. Structures in this area include a timber and fibro shed with shallow pitched skillion roof and a small brick toilet block. Access to the yard is via an easement leading to Pineapple Street.  Heritage listing  Mellors Drapery and Haberdashery was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 8 August 1994 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Mellors Drapery and Haberdashery, erected by 1922, is situated on land which has been the site of a store in Gayndah from the late 19th century, and as such, demonstrates the development of the town as a commercial centre for the Burnett district. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The intact interior space complete with many fittings such as shelves, display cabinets and counters housing a traditional range of merchandise organised into departments is a rare survivor of the pressures of commerce. In particular the flying fox cash dispenser provides rare evidence of money handling technology of the early 20th century. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Mellors, an excellent and comprehensive example of a medium-sized provincial store, is outstanding in its preservation of not only the physical fabric - the mass concrete construction, characteristic shop front, elegant interior and skylight; but also of the social fabric - a relatively unchanged style of management and service. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Built in the early 1920s as a country branch of Overells Pty Ltd, the store has an association with Overells, previously one of the major department stores in Queensland. Mellors continues its association with the Mellor family, who have been connected with retailing in central Queensland from 1886.

It aims to provide skills to standard six school‚Äìleavers to be used in the rural area, or to assist standard six and form three school-leavers in their future career planning. Agriculture comprises most of its education. The centre was founded by the Dutch Marist Fr. George Vanderzant in 1991, when there were 25 students. It is located in Na'ana, situated on fertile coastal land, an extensive food plain of the Weinagho (and others), and is located close to a natural water sources, such as the Weinagho and other rivers. A 2010 source noted that, due to a lack of electricity was not available at the centre, neither via a generator, nor via water or solar power. Therefore, the centre does not have computers. At that time, electricity and internet access were at a travelling distance of hours (which is also the time needed for travel between the centre and Kirakira by canoe). The mentioned source noted that the centre encompassed 92 students. In 2009, it was noted that there were over a hundred. In 1998, the construction of an airport was started.  Finances  Its relative expenditure on staff training for the period of 1993‚ÄîJune 1997 amounted to 1.8% of the total expenditure. Its relative expenditure on workshops or courses for the same period amounted to 4.5%. In 2009, it was allocated a budget of , as part of a Community Service Obligations/Community- Based Organisations Partnership.  Agriculture  = Crops = A 2009 reported noted that there were three Malayan Dwarf coconut palms at the centre which suffered from chlorosis, which could perhaps be due to a disease or due to the impoverishing of soil by removed scrapings to make the airstrip. It was advised to notify the Solomon Islands Department of Agriculture and Livestock if the chlorosis were to spread out, or if the yellowing of the Malayan Dwarfs increased. Little leaf disease was suspected in the centre's sweet potato, and advised to report further spread to the Department of Agriculture and Livestock and to Kastom Gaden Association. The report also noted that the centre had sweet potato and cassava between hedges of Gliricidia sepium on an area without topsoil, praised its soil reclamation as a good example, and stressed the potential of leguminous trees. = Bee keeping = Students at the centre partake in bee keeping. Marist Fr. David John Galvin, who grew up in Cambridge, Massachusetts, seems to have introduced bee keeping into the Stuyvenberg RTC. Fr. Galvin had developed an international reputation for bee keeping in general, and for domesticating wild Asian bees in particular. Around 2008, he returned to the centre, after going to Solomon Islands as a missionary some 42 years beforehand (before his first visit, he completed a MA at the request of the bishop in the Solomon Islands). In 2010, he was 73 years of age and in the United States for medical treatment, waiting to return to the South Pacific.  Courses  The library of the Stuyvenberg Rural Training Centre on 3 June 1993.

It is also one of the University's founding faculties, along with commerce, education, engineering, graduate studies, science, and physical education. The official establishment of the current Faculty of Arts was in 2010, following the amalgamation of the four former Faculties of Communication and Culture, Fine Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences. However, the Faculty of Arts can further trace its origins back to 1951 under the Faculty of Arts and Science, as it was originally merged with the University's natural sciences departments. This curious measure of dates makes the Faculty of Arts the second oldest faculty as well as the youngest faculty of the University simultaneously, depending on where one counts. Since then, the Faculty of Arts has expanded to become the University's most comprehensive and interdisciplinary faculty, incorporating fields from the humanities, fine arts, and social sciences. Due to its extensive nature, the Faculty of Arts is housed in various buildings throughout the main campus. The Faculty of Arts currently has more than 7,100 undergraduate students with more than 725 graduate students. The student population is overseen by 378 academic faculty members with the aid of 132 administrative and support staff. Since 1966, the Faculty of Arts has produced 10 Canada Research Chairs, 20 fellows of the Royal Society of Canada, and well over 46,000 alumni throughout the world. The current Dean of the Faculty of Arts is Richard Sigurdson who was appointed on 1 August 2012. Sigurdson holds a doctorate degree in Political Science from the University of Toronto, where his main topics of research included Canadian politics, immigration, First Nations peoples, and multiculturalism. Prior to becoming Dean to the University of Calgary, Sigurdson was the Dean for the Faculty of Arts and Acting Provost of University College at the University of Manitoba, where he also held the Duff Roblin Professorship of Government  History  Completed in 1960, the Administration building along with Science A are the two oldest buildings on the University campus. Currently, Administration houses the Department of Psychology and senior administrative offices. The Faculty of Arts can trace its history back to 1906, when the Calgary Normal School was established as a vocational school for teaching. Initially housed in Central School (later as James Short School), the School later moved in 1908 to the McDougall School to accommodate the growing student body. The School over time, began to offer introductory courses from the arts, sciences, engineering, and commerce. During this early history, the School moved several times: as an occupant of the west wing of the Provincial Institute of Technology and Art (then referred simply as Tech), to King Edward School in 1940, and back to the west wing of the Tech campus in 1945. By 1945, the School was replaced with university level courses, operating as an extension of the University of Alberta Faculty of Education. During this time, Calgary had become the largest Canadian city without a home-grown University. Calgarians were determined to change that fact and formed the University Committee as a vehicle to accelerate the effort to transform the Calgary branch into a full-fledged University. In 1948, the Committee published its first official proposal addressing the need for a \\"University of Southern Alberta,\\" to the Calgary Chamber of Commerce. The name was later rejected due to its acronym, USA, as to prevent confusion with the United States of America. In 1951, the Calgary branch started to offer first-year Bachelor of Arts and Sciences programmes under the newly established Faculty of Arts and Sciences. In the same year, the Arts and Science Society (ASS) was created to address student \\"grievances\\" for the newly established Faculty. This organisation would later become the Faculty of Arts Student's Association (FASA). In 1960 the Calgary branch, known then as the University of Alberta in Calgary (UAC), had moved from the west wing of the Tech campus, to its current location near University Heights. The founding buildings of the new campus were the Arts and Education (present-day Administration) and the Science and Engineering (present-day Science A) buildings, providing instructional courses for the \\"soft and hard sciences\\" respectively. Craigie Hall was originally named Calgary Hall when it was built in 1965, but was renamed after the untimely death of former Vice-President (Academic) Peter C. Craigie in 1987. = Creation of the University of Calgary = The first wave of construction conducted throughout early 1960s reignited conversations among students and citizens about the future of UAC with respect to the main campus in Edmonton. On 8 November 1963, a massive student protest dubbed \\"the Great Autonomy Demonstration of '63\\" occurred during a UAC Board of Governors' meeting, where protesters demanded autonomy for the budding UAC. The demonstration featured a headless mannequin with the words \\"Give UAC her head\\" and an engineering cog wheel with the words \\"Autonomy 196?.\\" This secessionist movement would be realised in 1966, when the Universities Act was passed, which declared the University of Calgary an autonomous institution from the University of Alberta. The resulting provincial Act granted the University full academic, financial, and administrative independence. In the same year, the Calgary Hall (renamed Craigie Hall) was officially open, which gave space to the University's diverse humanities and performing arts departments. Concurrently, the University became a trustee of the Banff School of Fine Arts, previously a satellite to the University of Alberta. The Banff School would remain an affiliated body to the University's fine arts departments until 1978, when it became an autonomous institution from the University. To pay homage to its past, the University adopted the colours red and yellow ‚Äì the former from the Calgary Normal School's azure, navy, and red and the latter from the University of Alberta's evergreen and gold. In 1967, the Faculty of Fine Arts was established, incorporating the departments of dance, drama, music, and visual arts. Shortly after, the highly anticipated Social Sciences building reached completion in 1969. The brutalist tower would become home to the university's various social science departments. Early plans for the university included an ambitious expansion plan for the major clusters of the present-day Faculty of Arts. Most of these plans were quietly abandoned.The University experienced a rapid period of growth just five years into autonomy. This led the University into considering ambitious expansion plans for the main campus. According to early schematic plans in 1967, the University desired to create building complexes that represent the major clusters of the present Faculty of Arts: fine arts, humanities, and social sciences. The Humanities Complex would have comprised six buildings of seven to nine stories tall along with a tower of over 13 stories tall, all of which would have been located directly east of present-day Administration ‚Äì none of these plans materialised. The Social Sciences complex would have comprised the Social Sciences Tower along with several four to seven story tall buildings surrounding present-day Administration ‚Äì only the Tower was completed. Only the Fine Arts Complex was built in its entirety, however not as originally planned. Due to the unbuilt Humanities Complex, the departments of fine arts have to share their intended space with the University's language, literature, and culture departments. It would take another two decades for the visual arts to obtain their own independent space, albeit reduced from the original plan. The incomplete Social Sciences and Humanities complexes were later abandoned by the mid 1970s for unknown reasons. = Decentralised Period = In 1972, the Earth Sciences building was completed, housing the departments of earth science, including anthropology, archeology, and geography. University enrolment increased from 3,740 undergraduates in 1966 to 10,864 by a mere decade later. This started to cause administrative problems and efficiency costs for the giant Faculty of Arts and Sciences. This led to the eventual breakup of the Faculty in 1976, resulting into the creation of the University College and three separate faculties: the Faculty of Sciences, the Faculty of Social Sciences, and the Faculty of Humanities. In the same year, the interdisciplinary Arctic Institute of North America took up residence on the University campus. In 1981, the University College, whose duties were to register first-year students into general studies, humanities, science, and social science programmes, renamed itself into the Faculty of General Studies. The University would later experience a second wave of growth when it was announced that Calgary (as well as the University) would host the XV Winter Olympic Games. In preparation for the Games, the University undertook several construction projects such as the Olympic Oval, the Athlete's Village (currently part of Residence), the Jack Simpson Gymnasium, and the Arts Building and Parkade which would house the University's visual arts departments. In 1994, the University played host to the Learned Societies Conference, an academic convention of scholars from the social sciences and humanities. The event witnessed about 8,000 delegates from more than 100 academic organisations, discuss and present their research from their respective fields of discipline. In 1998, following the trends of many North American universities, the University flirted with the idea of reorganising and condensing various departments and faculties as a measure to \\"encourage collaboration while maintaining their separate identities.\\" If realised, this move would have led to the creation of academic strategic clusters or \\"super- Faculties,\\" which would have merged fine arts, general studies, and humanities into the Faculty of Arts and Humanities, while merging education and social sciences into the Faculty of Education and Social Science. In 2000, the Faculty of General Studies renamed itself again to become the Faculty of Communications and Culture, which better reflected the Faculty's teaching and research activities Calgary oil boom, the Social Sciences Tower was constructed under the brutalist architectural design. = Creation of the Faculty of Arts = On 25 June 2009, the University Board of Governors voted to reunify the four separate faculties of Communication and Culture, Fine Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences into a single amalgam, the Faculty of Arts. The new streamlined Faculty was finalised on 1 April 2010, and was designed to conform with other Canadian research universities, most of whom \\"have two or fewer arts and social science-type faculties.\\" The departments of Music, Dance, and Drama would later merge in July 2013 to form the School of Creative and Performing Arts. In the same year, plans were announced that the University would no longer offer 19 undergraduate programmes in the upcoming academic year‚Äî10 of which belonged to the Faculty of Arts. Among these suspended programmes included the History and Philosophy of Science programme ‚Äì the only such programme offered in the province of Alberta. In 2014, it was announced that the departments of Greek and Roman Studies and Religion had merged into a single department of Classics and Religion. Simultaneously, the department of Archaeology and Anthropology had merged in the same year. The year of 2016 was celebrated as the University's semicentennial, marking 50 years of autonomy and academia. On 28 May to 3 June 2016, the University played host again to the 75th Congress of the Humanities and Social Sciences, welcoming 8,000 delegates, 70 academic organisations, and more than 5,000 research papers to be housed on the University campus. In June 2016, negotiations for the School of Languages, Linguistics, Literatures, and Cultures (SLLLC) were finalised as an effort to condense the University's humanities departments into a single collective entity. SLLLC was officially inaugurated in February 2019.  Student life  The Faculty of Arts is governed from the Office of the Dean of Arts, whose facilities are housed on the 13th floor of the Social Sciences tower. The Faculty however, encourages student participation through the use of department groups such as the Faculty of Arts Students' Association, whose duties include the management of the Arts Lounge found in the 2nd floor of the Social Sciences tower in room SS 217. Arts students have a variety of opportunities provided by the Faculty to supplement their undergraduate and graduate experience. Co-op work experience programmes are made available for students who wish to pursue them. Various student-run clubs exist around campus to cater to the interests of arts students and non-arts students alike. Undergraduate department associations, ranging from archaeology to women's studies, provide services and a sense of community among students of similar programmes. Due to the size of the Arts student population, the Faculty is granted 4 Students' Union representatives, to oversee the affairs of arts students with the University Administration. = Campus Culture = Being the second oldest and largest Faculty, the Arts has contributed a great deal to the history of the University. The Social Science building's southern wall has been subject to student folklore. In current day, due to rain exposure, plants have grown onto the formerly acidic stone wall. Above the first E on the Social Science sign, one can faintly see a black ball, supporting evidence of the climbing myth.  Climbing the Social Sciences building  Completed shortly after autonomy, the building was one of the oldest towers to overlook the current University campus. There is an old myth among arts students that the original architects envisioned a green-ivy-grown southern face, hence the lattice like design. As the myth continues, the architects did not take into account the acidity of the building's exterior structure, which made it unsuitable to support such climbing plants. However, years of rain exposure has washed the building's exterior to lower acidic levels, giving reason to the minimal plants that grow along the tower's base. Social Sciences would become intertwined with similar campus legend. This time involving a student, who for reasons unknown, attempted to mount an expedition along the southern face of the beige Tower. The event has been said to have occurred during the Bermuda Shorts Day of 1982 or 1983. Former students, University staff, and members of the Faculty have recalled a similar incident, however the event remains unconfirmed. The University Archives and Special Collections do maintain that they have a photograph of two people climbing the building with rock climbing equipment in their collections from April 1985. Strangely enough, students have noticed a mysterious black tennis ball wedged just above the Social Sciences building sign, which used to be visible from the connecting bridge from Social Science to Administration. This ball is no longer visible due to exterior renovations of the Tower in the 2016-2017 academic year.  The campus rocks  The infamous paint-covered boulders that are found throughout the campus, affectionately known as \\"the Rocks,\\" have become an integral part of campus culture. This is reflected in the University Registrar's phone numbers sometimes ending with the four digits -7625 (ROCK). The original rock has moved about the campus three times, initially placed north of Craigie Hall for a month, and was later moved east of the MacEwan Student Centre (MacHall). It was then moved to its current location adjacent to Swann Mall and the Registrar, to make way for the 2000 expansion of MacHall. The original rock was unearthed in the summer of 1968 during excavation for the future Social Science building. Campus geologists have determined the rock's origins to be of the Jasper National Park region prior to the last glacial age. The rock was scheduled for removal, but was rescued by members of the Arts Faculty who thought it would serve as an \\"excellent forum for students to voice their opinion.\\" Since that summer, the rock has become a common target for students to paint messages and other graphics, as well as to provide for an unmistakable meeting place for students and faculty alike. Soon messages of congratulation such as \\"Yay Finally Graduated\\" to the more political \\"Lougheed is a bum,\\" began to grace the fa√ßade of these no-longer-grey rocks. The Administration accepted this curious trend willingly, as it seemed to remove desire from the students to vandalise other buildings on campus. The rocks are often painted to advertise campus events, signal the start of new semesters, and in protest to current affairs. In an effort to re-open the Science A - Administration tunnel, a 1966 Gauntlet editorial proposed that \\"the underground central heating system tunnels could symbolize the purpose of the University: to guide us to the light of knowledge.\\"  Science A - Administration Tunnel  The existence of tunnels on campus has sparked the imagination of students since the early years of the University. There are, of course, the tunnels that connect the residence buildings with the Dining Centre, as well as the multiple maintenance tunnels which provide central heating and water to every building on campus. However, the oldest of these tunnels is the one that connects the two oldest buildings on campus, Science A with Administration. Then called the Science and Engineering building and the Arts and Education building respectively, this tunnel provided students passage from the harsh prairie winters between 1960 and 1963. This tunnel usage was described by a 1961 editorial from the Gauntlet: \\"A tunnel between Arts-Education Building and the Science-Engineering Building does exist...but this tunnel more closely resembles a catacomb than a tunnel,\\" only suitable for \\"troglodytes [who] never come out in the sun.\\" This tunnel however, also functioned as a central heating tunnel, carrying pipes containing pressurised water, hot steam, and electrical wiring. It was for this reason that they were closed by the Board of Governors, due to the potential hazards that the central heating pipes could have on transiting students. Reactions from students were widely negative, and several attempts to re-open the tunnels continued well into the late 1960s. A 1963 Gauntlet editorial summarised the general student reaction: \\"The tunnel was closed closed to spare us the danger of being parboiled, and this shows a gratifying concern for our welfare. But I, for one, would prefer to die warm.\\" This tunnel still exists today. The tunnel empties its steam from surface vents that protrude the earth in front of the southwest door of Science A and the west doors of Administration. They can only be accessed from Rooms SA 01V, AD 10A, and AD 39V. This tunnel can be seen the Interactive Room Finder under Room SA 01Z.  UAC Student Council Election 1964  Prior to the tradition of painting rocks, a curious incident occurred during the 1964 UAC Student's Council election, where Education candidate Francis Somerville brought \\"Sylvia\\", a donkey from the Calgary Zoo, as a publicity vehicle for his election campaign. Under the helm of campaign manager Ron Dougan, Sylvia was adorned with a blanket etched onto it \\"Don't be a jackass vote Francis.\\" Unfortunately, Somerville would lose that election by a handful of votes to his two female opponents. However, in the same year, he would become the President of the Education Undergraduate Society. Ironically, Dougan would have more luck than his client, when in the following year, he would become the UAC Council representative for Education in 1965.  Soft drink dispute  In 1997, the University decided to make Pepsi Cola Canada Beverages the exclusive supplier of cold drinks on campus, which was a common trend among North American universities. This infuriated some students who regarded the move as undermining institutional independence to a multinational corporation. The rock became a figurative soapbox for \\"pop soda libertarians\\", adopting red and white slogans Always Coca-Cola. An underground \\"anti-Pepsi movement\\" emerged on campus, advocating for the protection of soft drink alternatives to the Pepsi brand. The \\"movement\\" did very little to hurt the University's business relations with the soda giant. However, on certain department floors of Social Science (history and political science particularly), vintage Pepsi machines have been known to offer selections of Coca-Cola products with labels saying Always Coca-Cola attached to the machine's dispensary hole. The existence of such soda machines is quite curious, but it points to the possibly that some arts students and Faculty members are still continuing the cause for campus-wide soda freedom. In September 2017, the Board of Governor's announced their decision to switch from Pepsi Cola to Coca-Cola, as the former's contract had expired.  \\"I. M. Hungry\\" student protest  Strangely enough, this was not the first incident where students took up arms over Campus food. In 28 September 1965, a group of former arts and sciences UAC students, Charles Szuch, Michael \\"Mike\\" McEwan, Patrick \\"Pat\\" Tivy and Donald \\"Don\\" Dewar, along with former engineer UAC student Terrance \\"Terry\\" Peressini, staged a fake funeral for the figurative fallen student I. M. Hungry in front of the Food Centre (now Dining Centre). According to the participants, the event was done to protest \\"only the quantity of the food, not the quality.\\" The protest featured a shaky rendition of Taps interpreted by McEwan and a makeshift horn from newspaper. The funeral protest laid to rest the soul of I. M. Hungry, symbolised by the 'body' of former commerce student Stephanie Baker.\\"Leon the Frog, written in the early 1970s, has constantly been revitalised by consecutive generations of students due to stairwell renovations and usage wearing down the original words.  Tale of Leon the Frog  One of the most beloved features among arts students is the saga known as \\"The Tale of Leon the Frog\\" which was originally written in the early 1970s on top of the stairwell in Social Sciences. It chronicles the journey of a young frog named Leon, and features overheard conversations of students from the time. Such existentialist musings from the 13-flights-of-stairs long poem include: > \\"What is art? Where is?... am I here? Where is my will power? These are > barbaric conditions. Is this the hallmark of my life?\\" Former writer for the now-defunct University of Calgary Gazette, Cathy McLaughlin summarises that \\"Leon begins, on the basement floor of the Social Sciences stairwell, an existential search for identity and the 'light at the top of the stairs.' He escapes dissection, crucifixion, sexual harassment and an attempt to sell him insurance before hopping, finally, to the 13th floor, where art and a chance to 'express and communicate his experiences to society,' offers some solace.\\" The suspects who knowingly vandalised campus property have consistently claimed the work was done for the art. The five individuals responsible, who have been later identified as arts alumni, were Joane Cardinal-Schubert, Tony Acosta, Robin Laurence, Catherine McAvity, and Rita McKeough. Cardinal-Schubert has stated that the amphibious hero of the poem is a \\"metaphor for a student...lost in space.\\" The exact dating of this self-termed \\"happening\\" has not been entirely confirmed. However McLaughlin, has hypothesised \\"the sixth floor segment quotes from a Gauntlet article of Oct. 18, 1974, citing \\"turmoil, confusion and acrimony\\" in the political science department, and narrowing Leon's probable date of authorship.,\\" indicating that the \\"happening\\" took place around 1974. > \\"I find this particular [seventh] floor in a state of turmoil, confusion, > and acrimony!*\\" (Footnote: see the Gauntlet of Thursday Oct. 18/74) The main character himself has been a source of debate, particularly the stylistic naming choice of Leon for an adventurous frog. Campus historians Peter Fortna, Martina King, and Doug McColl have theorised that the name Leon might have been inspired by professor emeritus of Biological Sciences, Dr. Leon W. Browder. This was partly due to his academic tenure coinciding with the speculated period of the early 1970s. Strangely enough, Browder was fondly remembered for his research on early embryonic development for Xenopus laevis, commonly referred to as the African Clawed Frog. In April 2017, the Tale of Leon the Frog was painted over by the University maintenance for being mistaken for graffiti. To much of the dismay of arts students and alumni, efforts to restore the Tale were undertaken. This effort was completed in May 2017.  Calgary School  There is a prevalent myth among students, alumni, and outsiders alike of the perceived conservative or right-leaning themes that surround factions of the social science departments of the Faculty, particularly in the departments of political science, economics, and history. This is due, in part, by the so-called Calgary School, which was a loose, informal collection of former graduates and faculty members who have contributed in some measure, to the modern conservative movement in Alberta and Canada. The existence of the \\"School\\" has become common knowledge among students and members of the Faculty. Several arts graduates and Faculty members have been known to place prominently in the Conservative Party of Canada and have held various notable positions in government of arts alumnus Stephen Harper. This perception is strengthened by the popular presence of student-run campus clubs representing centre-right political parties on both the provincial and federal level.  Ghost of Earth Science  Rumours of a resident ghost have sprung up by arts students and alumni alike, claiming to have seen sightings of a brown haired woman in the Department of Anthropology and Archaeology in Earth Sciences. The Faculty Club was a former cafeteria and bar for the University's staff, originally located on the 7th floor of Earth Sciences in 1973, but permanently moved to the 4th floor of MacHall in 1985. Individuals have noticed strange apparitions regarding a \\"pleasant looking woman\\" with medium brown hair. The identity of this brunette, sweater wearing poltergeist is unknown, but several people have speculated it to be the former University Advisor to Women's Studies (1960-1966), Dr. Aileen A. Hackett Fish. Dr. Fish passed away on 3 March 1977, but left a long legacy of civil service, women's rights advocacy, and community involvement In 1973, Dr. Fish was awarded the Order of Canada medal and an honorary degree from the University of Calgary in 1976, both for her outstanding service at the community level. The Beta Sigma Phi Sorority established the Dr. Aileen Fish Memorial Bursary award shortly after her death, due to her strong relations with the sorority.  Bermuda Shorts Day  Bermuda Shorts Day is a cornerstone event of student life, however this event had more modest origins. In the summer of 1959, arts student Alan Arthur was ridiculed for wearing shorts in public, an apparent uncommon occurrence for men during the time. In the following year, on Thursday, 31 March 1960, Arthur who was the inaugural Associate-Editor for the newly created student-run newspaper the Gauntlet at the time, took to the campus advertisement board and wrote in chalk, words of what would become the start of a campus tradition. It is hotly contested what the original words were exactly, but one variant goes that Arthur wrote \\"Tomorrow is Bermuda Shorts Day. Everyone wear Bermuda Shorts.\\" Arthur has stated that he wrote the now immortal words, in part to the arrival of warm spring weather, in jest as a light-hearted April Fools joke, and as an unlikely way to reduce stigma around men donning short-cut trousers. The famed arts alumnus, Maurice Yacowar ‚Äì who was The Gauntlet's inaugural Editor-in-Chief at the time ‚Äì was a contemporary and personal friend of Arthur. Yacowar recalls that many individuals of the UAC's 250 student population stayed true to Arthur's announcement, and wore Bermuda shorts that April Fools of 1960. The first BSD, according to Arthur and Yacowar, was a more innocent affair, featuring a highly competitive marbles tournament. Due to a controversial article entitled \\"Don't Wear a Poppy,\\" Yacowar was abruptly fired from his position as Editor- in-chief just five months in, receiving a 56.4% student-wide favourability rating against his dismissal. He was then succeeded by his friend Arthur, becoming the second Gauntlet Editor-in-chief. The pair would later graduate in 1962 to pursue lives in academia. Arthur who received a degree in History would later become a ‚Äì now retired ‚Äì Professor of History from Brock University while Yacowar, who received a degree in English, would become Emeritus Professor of English and future Dean of Humanities here in the University of Calgary. However, little did Arthur know just how powerful those 9 words would become, as the event gained increasing popularly for students to destress before exams. The BSDs of later years would feature pie duels with the University President, musical gatherings in Administration, games of squamish, and a tricycle race between SU representatives. In 1989, the University with the Students' Union introduced the BSD of modern day, with a single area which included the concert grounds and beer gardens.

Founded in 1927, CLRG is responsible for creating a standardised system of Irish dance, music and competition for its member organisations in 26 countries. It organises Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne (the World Championships) as well as Oireachtas Rince na h√âireann (the All Ireland Championships), and is the central authority for teacher and adjudicator accreditation. It is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland.  History  In 1927, Conradh na Gaelige, an organisation dedicated to promoting the Irish language, organised a Commission of Enquiry \\"for the purpose of examining the organisation of Irish dancing as it existed at that time and to make recommendations as to how it might be better organised in the future. The Commission's stated aim was to unify the various interests involved in Irish dancing and pursue the common goal of promoting the cultural heritage of dance in Ireland. In 1930, the Commission presented its recommendations, and Conradh na Gaelige established An Coimisi√∫n as a permanent body to carry out those recommendations. The CLRG board was initially made up of 3 delegates from the Dublin Irish Dance Teachers, 3 from the Irish Music Society, and 18 delegates from Conradh na Gaelige. This under-representation of dancing teachers was to cause problems within the first few decades of CLRG's existence. In 1939, CLRG published the first edition of √År Rince Foirne (Our Team Dances), an official handbook for the teaching and learning of ceili (social) dances. This was to become standard knowledge for CLRG registered teachers. On its first register of qualifications, CLRG listed 32 teachers from across Ireland. By 1943, a standard system of certification had been introduced in order to organise the training of new teachers and adjudicators. In 1969, a group of Irish dance teachers, frustrated with what they perceived to be a lack of influence in the growing organisation, broke from CLRG and formed Comhdh√°il na M√∫inteoir√≠ le Rinc√≠ Gaelacha (The Congress of Irish Dance Teachers) to compete with CLRG. These two organisations remain the most significant in Irish dancing, although CLRG is considerably larger and more highly gloablised. One enduring legacy of \\"the Split\\" is that CLRG competitions are open only to dancers from CLRG, and CLRG registered dancers are forbidden from competing with other \\"open- platform\\" organisations. (An Chomhdh√°il was originally open-platform, but later became closed after a breakaway from its own ranks.) Following the Split, CLRG decided to host Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne (the World Championships) for the first time in 1970. The first championships took place at the auditorium of Col√°iste Mhuire, a school in Dublin. The next important development in Irish dance came with the 1994 Eurovision launch of Riverdance. This event, followed by the continuing success of the Irish dance troupe, led to a massive increase in global interest for Irish dance. Over the following 20 years, the number of competitors at the World Championships increased dramatically, and the percentage of dancers from outside Ireland and the U.K. lifted to nearly 50%. The rapid increase in the number of dancers across the world accelerated the globalisation, and led to the election of Peter Smith in 2004 as the first president resident outside Ireland. By 1999, there were approximately 500 dance teachers registered with CLRG in Ireland and 600 in other countries. Through the early 2000s, CLRG faced criticism for failing to address the increasing influence of other dance styles on traditional Irish dance. The introduction of movements from Spanish flamenco, ballet and other styles led to concerns about the erosion of traditional Irish culture. Costumes also became more relaxed and modern following the popularity of shows such as Riverdance. Particularly controversial was the use in competition of tight curled wigs, fake tan and crystal embellishment, ostensibly to draw attention to a dancer on stage. Some have criticised this movement as representing an oversexualisation of dancers. A heavily revised and updated ceili handbook, renamed to Ar Rince Ceili (Our Ceili Dances), was also released in 2014. This coincided with a revised set of rules for dancers and teachers as well as the introduction of a grade exam system for dancers. The new rules included a prohibition on the use of makeup or false eyelashes in competition for dancers under the age of 10, as well as a restriction on \\"carriage aids\\", which assisted competitors to maintain a rigid posture. In 2014, CLRG estimated that some 250,000 dancers were taught under its jurisdiction.  Organisation structure  CLRG operates in 25 geographic regions. Each of these regions is administered by a Regional Authority reporting to CLRG, and hosts a qualifying event for Oireachtas Rince Na Cruinne. In Australia and North America, multiple regions are combined under a single regional authority, as follows. = Australia = Australian Irish Dancing Association (AIDA) * NSW * Victoria * Queensland * ACT * South Australia * Western Australia = North America = North American Feis Commission/Irish Dancing Teachers Association of North America (IDTANA) * Mid Atlantic * Mid America * Western US * Eastern Canada * Western Canada * New England * Southern US = Great Britain = * Scotland * England ‚Äî Midlands * England ‚Äî North-West * England ‚Äî North-East * England ‚Äî South = Ireland = * Connaght * Leinster * Munster * Ulster = Rest of the world = * New Zealand: Traditional Irish Dance Association of New Zealand * Europe: Registered Teachers of Mainland Europe * South Africa * Asia: Taiwan,Japan,Hong Kong *South America: S.A.I.D.A. (South American Irish Dance Association)  Competition structure  A medal awarded to qualifiers for Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne at the Connacht Championships CLRG organises two major competitions each year: Oireachtas Rince Na Cruinne (the World Championships) and Oireachtas Rince na h√âireann (the All Ireland Championships). Oireachtas (plural: Oireachtais) is the Gaelic term for championship, and in CLRG competition refers to a three-round competition marked by at least three adjudicators. Apart from this, competitions are organised by Regional Authorities and registered with CLRG. The most significant of these are the annual Regional Championships, which are the primary qualifying events for the World Championships. The larger Regional Authorities also hold secondary qualifying events, such as the North American National Championships, the Great Britain Championships, the All Ireland Championships, and the Australian Championships. Dancers may qualify for the World Championships at either a primary or secondary qualifying event, but if they qualify at a secondary event they must dance (or have danced) in the primary qualifier to remain eligible. Each region also hosts a number of other competitions throughout the year, known as feisanna. These events range in scale and structure from small local competitions with a single adjudicator to large oireachtais in the style of Worlds qualifying events. = Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne = The Irish Dancing World Championships (often known simply as the Worlds) are held annually in Easter Week. Until 1999, the Championships were held permanently in Ireland. Since 2000, however, they have been held in a number of countries each year, and have taken place in Northern Ireland, Scotland, England, the United States and Canada. The Championships are open to dancers who have qualified at Regional Championships in the calendar year following the previous Worlds. The World Championships have a similar structure to regional championships: there are separate competitions for solo and ceili (team) dancing, divided by age group. Solo competition takes place across three rounds, typically in front of a rotating panel of adjudicators. Ceili competition includes both traditional ceili dances (as outlined in Ar Rince Ceil√≠) and Own Choreography sections. The largest Own Choreography section, the Figure Dance, is for up to 16 dancers, must portray \\"an Irish theme or legend\\" and is considered the most prestigious team event in Irish dancing. The championships involve about 5,000 dancers from across CLRG's regions each year. Past and future host cities of the World Championships include: Oireachtas Rince Na Cruinne has been described as the \\"Olympics of Irish dance\\", and as a \\"vital boost\\" to city economies because of the 15,000 visitors it brings to the host city. The 2018 event in Glasgow was estimated by city officials to represent a contribution to the local economy. A competitive tendering process is in place for determining future host cities of the championships.  Examinations and accreditation  CLRG organises grade exams for dancers and accreditation exams for teachers and adjudicators. The teaching and adjudicating qualifications are recognised globally by CLRG, and are also recognised by certain other dance organisations. There are 12 dance exam grades (and a preliminary grade). Candidates must demonstrate proficiency in a variety of solo and ceil√≠ dances, and are marked on timing, footwork, execution and carriage, as in competition. On completion of all 12 grades, dancers are awarded The Diploma of the Irish Dancing Commission. The teaching and adjudicating qualifications are as follows: * TMRF ‚Äì qualified to teach ceili (teams) dancing. Must be at least 20 years old and pass written and practical exams. * TCRG (Teagasc√≥ir Coimisi√∫n Le Rinci Gaelacha) ‚Äì the \\"teacher\\" qualification. Qualified to teach both solo and ceili dancing. Must be at least 20 years old and pass written and practical exams in dancing, music and the Gaelic language. From 2018, must also have completed all 12 grades of practical dance exam. * ADCRG (Ard Diploma Coimisi√∫n Le Rinc√≠ Gaelacha) ‚Äì the \\"adjudicator\\" qualification. As well as teaching, qualified to adjudicate at any CLRG-recognised competition. Must be at least 30, have held TCRG qualification for at least 5 years, and pass further written and practical exams. * SDCRG (Scr√∫daithoir Coimisi√∫n Le Rinc√≠ Gaelacha) ‚Äì the \\"examiner\\" qualification.

It was built in 1864 by Henry Fenwick. It is now known as Gayndah Museum. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 14 December 2001.  History  The Brick Cottage in Gayndah was built in 1864 by Mr Henry Fenwick for a Mr Alexander Walker, early resident and licensee of the Gayndah Hotel. The cottage is located in the centre of town and is the oldest surviving brick residence in Gayndah. Gayndah was first settled as a town in 1849, shortly after squatters selected land in the Central Burnett. The site of what was to become the Gayndah Township was selected and named in 1849 by Maurice Charles O'Connell, Land Commissioner for the Burnett. In 1850 the name of Gayndah was recognised when the Post Office and Courthouse were gazetted, but it wasn't until 1852 that Gayndah was gazetted as a town. Once the road to the Port of Maryborough was surveyed and cleared in an influx of settlers followed and over the next ten years Gayndah's sheep, cattle, diary and agricultural industries began to flourish. Early freehold land sales were held in Gayndah in 1854. Joseph Hadley was one of the first people to buy land in the town and purchased the land that the brick cottage now resides on in 1854 for . In 1864, Alexander Walker purchased the land from Mr Hadley and employed local builder, Henry Fenwick, to build a brick cottage, where it is believed he resided for the next six years. Alexander Walker was an early resident of Gayndah. He was the licensee of the Gayndah Hotel and owner of the property, Mt Cyrus, located just outside Gayndah. He was also foster father to the Barnard boys, who he had taken into his care when their father died in 1858. In 1870 William Barnard took over ownership of the brick cottage on Simon Street. William Barnard, a local blacksmith, and his wife Elizabeth McDonald, remained as residents of the cottage until the death of their daughter, Ellen, in 1958. The cottage then passed through a number of hands until the Gayndah Shire Council purchased the cottage in 1969 in order to save it from demolition. The allotment the Brick Cottage resides on once ran from Capper Street through to Burnett Terrace and had several other buildings on the lot including a Blacksmith. Constructed of locally manufactured brick laid in the Flemish bond, the Georgian style cottage originally consisted of 3 rooms with a central fireplace. In , an open verandah with a small room to one side that served as a semi-detached kitchen was added to the back of the cottage. The presence of two front doors also indicates that the cottage may have been built for use as a residence and shop but there is no evidence to support to suggest that any of the owners used it for this purpose. During the Barnard's occupation the interior of the original cottage remained relatively unchanged. When the Barnard's sold the property in 1958 it passed through a number of hands and underwent some alterations. The back verandah was enclosed sometime during the late 1950s and the original timber flooring was removed, leaving the main bedroom with a rough concrete floor and the living area with a dirt floor. The mantels over the central fireplace were also removed at some point and the wall separating the two bedrooms demolished, effectively changing the cottage from 3 rooms to 2. A number of conservation works have taken place since the Gayndah Shire Council purchased the Brick Cottage in 1969. In 1988 the original shingled roof was removed and replaced with a corrugated iron hip roof. At this time, work was also carried out on the ceiling, which needed to be repaired again in 1994, as it was beginning to sag due to incorrect installation of the roof timbers. The dirt floor in the main room was laid with concrete to match the exposed floor in the bedrooms, the front doors of the cottage were replaced and the interior walls replastered. The mantels over the central fireplace were also replaced, on one side with what is believed to be a replica of the original and the other with the mantel from the fireplace at Ban Ban homestead. The Brick Cottage now operates as a museum under the direction of the Gayndah Historical Society. Once the only building on the lot, the cottage is now bordered on both sides by other buildings from the town of Gayndah to form part of an historical village. It houses a collection of memorabilia, which covers many aspects of early life in and around Gayndah.  Description  The Brick Cottage is located on the southern end of Simon Street, Gayndah, between Capper Street and Burnett Terrace. The cottage is a simple, symmetrical single storey building constructed of locally manufactured bricks laid in Flemish bond with a corrugated iron roof. A timber framed addition is attached at the rear and has corrugated iron skillion roof. The masonry portion of the house displays a Georgian influence through its simple rectangular form and symmetrical facade which has two large six-pane sash windows and two front doors to Simon Street. A rear door provides access to the enclosed verandah and lean to on the western elevation and there are two sash windows on the southern elevation and one on the northern elevation. The eaves are not lined and the rafters have a curved end profile. Internally the main cottage has a recent concrete slab floor, rendered walls and ceilings lined with beaded tongue and groove boards. The cottage is divided into two by a load bearing masonry wall that houses two fireplaces - one to each side. The northern portion of the cottage was once two rooms and evidence survives of the location of the dividing wall. To the rear of the cottage is an enclosed verandah and semi-detached lean-to. The enclosed verandah has been extended and divided into two rooms. Both rooms are clad with weatherboards and some sections lined with fibro sheeting. The semi-detached lean-to is constructed of wooden battens with a corrugated iron roof.  Heritage listing  Brick Cottage was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 14 December 2001 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Brick Cottage was erected in the town of Gayndah in 1864. It holds a special association for the community of Gayndah as the only surviving residence from the town's settlement period. The Brick Cottage demonstrates the pattern of development of some of Queensland's more remote towns. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Built in the very early stages of the town's development, the cottage is a good example of a mid 19th century workers dwelling and constructed of the now rare use of locally produced hand made bricks.

After his release, he volunteers in the social, educational and business fields. Serves as chairman and strategic advisor of several companies in Israel and abroad, and serves as chairman of \\"Yahad - United for Israel's Soldiers\\", chairman of the association \\"After Me!\\" and chairman of an association that operates drug and alcohol rehab villages. Yair built and heads the Rabin Leadership Program at the IDC Herzliya. Military service Yair was born in Kibbutz Ein Hanatziv, grew up in Tel Aviv and attended Ironi D. High School in the city, was a member of HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed youth movement. He enlisted in the IDF in August 1963 as part of the Nahal Gar'in (Core Group). At the end of his basic training, he was sent to his displeasure for a Squadron Commanders Course in Shivta , which he completed as an outstanding Company trainee and even remained as an instructor. At the end of the Officers Academy which he then proceeded to, he returned to serve as a Platoon Commander at the Squadron Commanders Course and when asked to sign for permanent service, he asked for and even conditioned it on moving to the Paratroopers' Brigade . His request was accepted and he served as a Platoon commander and Deputy Company Commander in the Parachuted Nahal Battalion, the 50th Battalion and eight months later was appointed Company Commander . In the Six Day War, Yair served as the Hod (Spearhead) company commander who were first to break into the Rafah tensions, at the head of the 50th Battalion which led the Paratroopers' Brigade, under the command of Raful. Yair, fought at the head of his company and managed with his one half-track with ten soldiers on, to break through about a mile and a half into the heart of the compound, fighting hundreds of enemy soldiers. Their progress was halted, when, the half-track was hit and exploded and three of the ten soldiers, killed and the rest wounded, Yair was severely wounded but fought along his soldiers in the Egyptian soldiers attacking them. His rescue from the battlefield took place many hours later. In 1968, he began his academic studies and chose the psychology track. In 1971, he completed his undergraduate studies and began his master's degree studies. In the same year, he returned to active service and was an instructor in the IDF Officer Candidate School. In this role, he identified the main issue of the Officers Academy and which was a dropout rate of over 50% of the cadets in the school and chose to serve as the Officers Academy psychologist. As the school's psychologist, he invented and developed the system for the sorting and formation of the cadets at the entrance to the academy. At a later stage, his method was transferred to the Paratroopers Brigade and the various patrols. Since then, Yair's system has been used as the IDF's sorting system for admission to elite units. In 1972, Yair returned to the Paratroopers' Brigade and was appointed Deputy Commander of the Parachuted Nahal Battalion until August 1973 when he left for the Inter-Armed College of Command and Staff. In October 1973, with the outbreak of the Yom Kippur War, Yair was a Major ranked student at The Inter-Armed College of Command and Staff. On the morning of Yom Kippur, he was asked by the commander of the Paratroopers Brigade to go back to the 50th Battalion, whose soldiers were manning the border outposts, in the southern half of the Golan Heights. Yair was sent to serve as a Deputy Commander of the 50th Battalion. The battalion commander was wounded in a parachute training two weeks earlier, and Menachem Zatursky the Deputy Commander took his place. Yair arrived at the battalion headquarters at El Al, under the heavy Syrian shelling that opened the war. There it became clear to him that the connection with Zatursky and the operations officer who had both gone out into the field had been lost. Yair took command of the battalion. The battalion took part in the difficult containment battle against the Syrian offensive in the southern Golan Heights. Already on the evening of Yom Kippur, the southern sector was left without tanks in the face of the Syrian division's attack. At dawn the next day - Sunday, after the Syrians occupied Tel Saki and Ramat Magshimim and reached a range of from the battalion's headquarters, Yair was ordered to retreat with all the fighters at headquarters to the Sea of Galilee. Yair, orders his soldiers to retreat towards Ein Gev, while he decides to be left alone, at his observation post, located near the front line, watching the Syrian division preparing to resume its attack south-ways. Yair kept in touch with his fighters trapped in outposts inside the territory occupied by the Syrians. When the first reserve tanks arrived in the sector, Yair positioned them to stop the Syrian attack, which reached up to 700 meters from its position and was stopped. The next day, Yair led the second rescue attempt of the Tel Saki and post 116 fighters, and managed to reach the besieged and wounded and rescue them. Yair was able to recover the battalion that was badly damaged, with the help of his demand from the IDF High Command to allow the battalion to return and participate in the fighting. Yair crossed the Suez Canal and led at the head of his battalion the advance of the three armoured brigades of the Baran Division, against the Egyptian commando and outposts in the agricultural buffer zone along the freshwater canal and lakes. The battalion fought for more than a hundred miles, as far as the outskirts of the city of Suez. Yair was careful to make use of the battalion's advantages and conducted all the fighting in the Egyptian complexes along the tens of kilometres in infantry fighting, which surprised the Egyptians who waited for Israeli tanks with anti-tank missiles. In all the long days of fighting on the other side of the Suez Canal not one of the battalion's soldiers was killed. In 1975, Yair was appointed commander of the Company Commanders Course and was sent to the United States to attend a one-year Command and Staff course of the United States Army. Upon his return from the United States, Yair was promoted to the rank of Colonel and served as head of Combat Theory at the Infantry and Paratroopers Chief Division. In Operation Litani , Yair commanded a combined brigade battle team of two radar school battalions: the 906th and 17th Battalions and the 53rd Armoured Battalion, under the Infantry and Paratroopers Chief Division, Brigadier General Uri Simchoni. The forces, under Yair's command, conquered Tel Chalaaboun, Tel 850 and junction Chaff - al Hawa, killing 55 terrorists. Then, Yair founded the Anti-Missile Brigade, \\"Hazi HaEsh\\" Division, and was appointed commander of the Officers Academy. In 1981, Yair was appointed commander of the Paratroopers Brigade. That same year, as the Paratrooper Brigade Commander, Yair led two raid operations deep in Lebanon , in response to artillery fire between the PLO and the IDF. Yair commanded Operation \\"Zilzal\\" More than deep in Lebanon. In this operation, Yair's force had one man killed and seven wounded, and under heavy fire coming from all the hills and buildings around, Yair managed to rescue the force with the help of two Yasur helicopters, which returned to Israel with bullet holes all around. In the first Lebanon War, Yair served as the Paratrooper Brigade Commander as well. In accordance with Yair's proposal, the Paratroopers' Brigade made a vertical flank - an amphibious landing from the sea north of Sidon in the depths of Lebanon, about from the border, the brigade continued to lead IDF forces to the suburbs of Beirut. During the first three days, the brigade advanced and fought, detached from the rest of the IDF forces, moving from the direction of the Israeli border up north. The choice of the mountain axis - long, made in light of the joining to the Armoured corps forces, was supposed to delay the brigade's forces, compared to the advanced IDF forces on the short coastal axis, only towards Beirut. However, in test of time, Yair's decision was correct, and the Paratroopers were indeed the first force to arrive to Beirut and to join the Christian forces on the Beirut - Damascus axis. During the battles, Yair was lightly wounded. After the Sabra and Shatila massacre, Performed by the Christian phalanxes, Yair entered the refugee camp at the head of a group of soldiers to reassure its terrified residents. Following the distress among his fighters, who witnessed Sabra and Shatila events, Yair demanded to meet with Prime Minister Menachem Begin , and instead met with Defense Minister Arik Sharon. Yair demanded that he take responsibility for what happened in Beirut, so that the blame would not fall on IDF fighters . After the war, Yair was appointed Division Commander, and he built and established the Airborne 98th Division. After converting to the Armoury Core, he commanded an armoured division in reserve, the \\"Pillar of Fire\\" Division and a Battalion Commander's course. During this time he returned to the academy in order to complete his master's degree in psychology at Bar-Ilan University, while studying for an MBA at Tel Aviv University. In 1987, before graduating, he was called to the post of commander of the Lebanese sector, Division 91, when the IDF was inside Lebanese territory. In this position, Yair made a significant change in the planning of operations and activities in the sector, where instead of the initiative and planning of operations being carried out at the command and division level and from there to the battalions and companies, Yair decided that the commanders in the field would be the ones to initiate and plan the activities. This change has doubled the amount of activities and operations and streamlined them. Under his command, the division carried out about eighty operations and raids across the border. In 1988, Yair was promoted to the rank of Major General and was appointed Commander of the Northern Corps, which commanded five divisions whose mission was fighting on the Syrian front. In 1992, Yair was appointed head of the Manpower Directorate at the General Staff of the IDF. Immediately upon taking office, he made a fundamental change in the method of recruitment to the IDF each candidate for recruitment will go through the selection system, fulfil his preferences and wishes and according to this will be assigned to the various units even before his enlistment. This significant change resulted in the shortening of the recruitment process to one day instead of 4‚Äì5 days, allowing the start of basic training within one day and over 85% of the recruits were placed according to their first or second preferences. He also made changes to improve the service conditions of the permanent servants and established the \\"Hever\\" club which was the first consumer club in the country. As part of his role, he chaired the committee, alongside Professor Asa Kasher, who worked for three years to compile and write the Code of Ethics for the IDF - an \\"IDF Spirit\\" document. In 1990, he published a book, Etty from Lebanon, about the paratroopers' fighting in the 1982 Lebanon War. In 1995, when he was about to be released, he was asked by Prime Minister and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin to serve as an IDF attach√© in Washington, during the period of contacts and talks on an agreement with the Syrians, and served there for about three years.  After Military Service  In 1998, Yair was released and became involved in social and educational activities, he serves as chairman, on a purely voluntary basis, of a number of associations that operate in these areas. Yair serves as chairman of the organisation that operates rehab facilities from drugs and alcohol in Ilanot and Hartuv, he is the chairman \\"After Me!\\" - Youth Leads a Change, a social educational movement which prepares thousands of youth and young people from the geographical and social periphery for significant service in the IDF and leadership positions in the community. Since 1982, while still in active service, Yair helped establish and promote the \\"Association for the Advancement of Education in Jaffa\\" in the most difficult area of mixed Jaffa, and he continues this activity to this day. Yair, served for seven years as chairman of the board of directors of Hadassah Youth. Today, Yair is the chairman of \\"Yahad - United for Israel's Soldiers\\" after merging the Association for the Welfare of Israel's Soldiers and the LIBI Foundation into one organisation, in 2015. Upon taking office, he made a number of significant changes, first and foremost stating that 100% of all donations will go to the soldiers. He stated that the soldier at the center is the organisations primary goal, the organisation's expenses were significantly reduced and the number of volunteers for the organisation increased. Since 2009, he has been leading a unique leadership program - the Rabin Program at the IDC Herzliya. The program is unique in academia, bringing together outstanding students from the various schools of the Interdisciplinary Centre, for an annual program. The course, taught by Yair himself, is called \\"Practical Leadership,\\" which expresses the unique concept of leadership that Yair developed about 40 years ago and which he teaches in the IDF and various civilian bodies. It combines various lectures and practical experience of students, initiating and establishing social projects. In parallel with his volunteer activities in the various associations, Yair works and is active in the business field.

Sitaram is faced with the difficulty of raising crops in the Indian monsoon climate. Despite his best efforts, Sitaram's field yields nothing but weeds. Sitaram's efforts to quench the thirst of his land lead him to dig a well.

To get the resources he needs, he approaches the local bank specifically established to meet the needs of farmers, only to realize that getting help there is even more complex than breaking Kalichaat.

It was built . It is also known as Gayndah Race Track. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 12 September 2005.  History  The Gayndah Racecourse was established in the mid 1850s to replace a track established nearby in 1852. The first Queensland Derby race was held there in 1868 and the course is still in regular use for horse racing. Europeans in search of grazing land for sheep first explored the Burnett in the early 1840s and the town of Gayndah was founded in 1849 to serve pastoral stations in the district. The site of the town was chosen and named by Maurice O'Connell, then Land Commissioner for the area. Gayndah developed as an administrative centre, having a court house and police station in the 1850s, soon followed a school, post office and bank. It was at one time considered to be a contender for the capital of Queensland when Separation from New South Wales was contemplated. By the late 19th century, cattle had replaced sheep on the surrounding pastoral properties and citrus orchards had been successfully established. From the turn of the century, dairying also played a part in the providing an economic basis for the development of the area. In 1852, the year that Gayndah was officially gazetted as a town, a public meeting was held at the Burnett Arms in Gayndah to organise the setting up of a track for horse racing. was collected and a suitable area at the edge of town selected. The winning post was set up midway between two hotels, the Burnett Arms and the Corinth Arms, which were about two and a half miles apart. The first race was held on 30 June 1852. It was a three-day event with racing on the first and third days for prizes in excess of . This track was used for a few years before the current and more level site nearby replaced it, probably in 1855 or 1856. A meeting was held at the Royal Hotel, Gayndah in July 1858 to mount a petition to Sir William Denison, Governor of New South Wales (the separation of Queensland did not occur until 1859), to grant the Crown Land on which the track was situated for use as a racecourse on the grounds that the town had not been granted a recreation reserve and there was no other course closer than Ipswich, away. There were 65 signatories to the petition, but it did not have an easy passage. As the land on which the track was located was in an area intended to serve as future suburban allotments, the government was at first inclined to refuse the request and on 6 May 1859 asked for guidance from the Surveyor General's office. A report of 25 August 1859 recommended that as town development was in fact taking place away from this area, a reserve of between should be granted for a racecourse. The request was approved on 11 June 1859, but Queensland was separated from New South Wales on 10 December 1859 as a self-governing colony. The racecourse reserve, of , was surveyed in March 1862 and the land grant signed by Sir George Bowen, the first Governor of Queensland, on 26 March 1863 at a quit rent of one farthing \\"as a racecourse and for no other purpose\\". Trustees were Berkely Basil Moreton, Alpin Grant Cameron, Robert Wilkin Smith, Gilbert William Eliott and Francis Glynn Connolly. Horses had arrived in Australia with the First Fleet in 1788 and the first organised horse race was run at Hyde Park in 1810. In 1842 the first racing club, the Australian Jockey Club, was formed. In Queensland, horse racing was one of the earliest organised sports following the opening of the Moreton Bay District for free settlement. The first race meeting was held at Coopers Plains on 17 July 1843 and there was a racecourse at New Farm in Brisbane by May 1846. In 1848 the towns of Warwick, Ipswich and Drayton organised race meetings. Government authorities took racing seriously as more than a sport as horses were then the main means of transport for economic, military and recreational purposes and racing was thought to help improve breeding. In 1861, the Gayndah Race Club decided to change its name to the Queensland Jockey Club; at the time, racing at Brisbane was under the auspices of the Brisbane Race Club and at Ipswich as the North Australia Race Club. Eagle Farm Racecourse opened in Brisbane in 1863, replacing the 1846 New Farm track, and the Queensland Turf Club was formed. The Gayndah racecourse by this time had booths for hire where publicans and confectioners supplied refreshments. Gayndah hosted the first Queensland Derby held in Queensland. This is a classic race for three-year-olds run over one and a half miles and was first held in 1780 at Epsom in England, being named for the 12th Earl of Derby. In Australia the first Derby was run in 1861 at Randwick in Sydney and in 1868 one was held at Gayndah. Bookmakers came up from Melbourne for the event. The race was won by the house Hermit, with owner William Parry-Okeden receiving the prize of 20 sovereigns. The Derby was held at Gayndah for two more years until falling into abeyance and being revived in 1872 in Brisbane. The race meetings were gala events attended by people from the surrounding district and from as far afield as Port Curtis, Ipswich and Nanango. Horses came from as far away as Sydney to compete and Gayndah considered itself the racing centre of Queensland, even after the Derby had moved to Brisbane. A Brisbane Cup was held in 1866 and a Gayndah Cup in 1867 quickly followed by Cup events at Gympie, Maryborough, Rockhampton, Townsville, Charters Towers, Toowoomba, Warwick and Dalby. In spite of the early establishment of the Queensland Turf Club and the development of horse racing in regional centres during the 1860s and 1870s, it did not become popular in Queensland on a large scale until the 1880s, when there was a boom in racing and many new clubs were formed and race meetings held. A new code of rules was adopted in 1885 based on those of the English Jockey Club and a system of registration of all clubs under the Queensland Turf Club rules was instituted. The Queensland Racing Calendar was first published in 1886 and in 1890 all clubs agreed to empower the Queensland Turf Club to allot dates for meetings to prevent clashes. In 1914 the racecourse land was gazetted as a reserve under Trustees led by the Mayor of Gayndah and on 29 October 1937 a special meeting was held by the Council to formulate by-laws. These were gazetted on 3 March 1938 under the provisions of the Local Government Land Act 1936. The Gayndah Shire Council are still trustees for the racecourse. New service buildings were constructed at the racecourse in the 1980s. The track itself has been in use as a racecourse since its inception and the Gayndah Jockey Club still hosts regular racing meetings there. A statue of a horse and rider in Capper Street commemorates the running of the first Queensland Derby.  Description  The Gayndah Racecourse occupies a large level area on the southeast side of the town. It is bounded on three sides by roads and a large block of open land adjoins it to the south. Two gates access the racecourse grounds. One comprises timber posts supporting a tubular metal structure framing the letters G.J.C. for Gayndah Jockey Club, the other is a timber gate constructed to commemorate the Centenary of Federation and also the founding in Gayndah of Queensland's first Jockey Club in 1861 and the first Queensland Derby in 1868. The track itself occupies most of the space and is enclosed on either side by a fence of metal posts with a white painted top rail. It is grassed and roughly oval in shape, being in circumference with a training track on the inside. Crops are currently grown in the centre of the course. A mechanical starting stall is used to start each race and the straight with the winning post is set at the northwest corner of the track overlooked by a metal tower. Bougainvilleas are planted along the edge of the track in this area and to the north of the tower is a set of parallel rails coloured red, yellow and blue for the winning horses. To the rear of the paddock area and extending southwest are two parallel sets of modern buildings. The facilities closest to the track include a clubhouse and betting ring, bars, a ladies' room and a tearoom and kitchen. A second set of buildings to the northwest comprises jockeys' rooms, offices and the Totalisator office with a toilet block at the northern end. There are also 60 day stalls for horses and a swabbing stall with a washing down bay at the end of the stalls. The saddling enclosure is between the jockeys' room and the track. All these buildings currently serving the course were constructed towards the end of the 20th century and have no heritage significance.  Heritage listing  Gayndah Racecourse was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 12 September 2005 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. As a horseracing track, established in the 1850s during the first phase of free European settlement in Queensland, the Gayndah Racecourse is evidence for the importance and early development of the sport. Horse races were amongst the first organised sporting events in Australia and served as both a recreation and for the furtherance of horse breeding. This was important in an era when horses were used for transport, industry and warfare as well as for recreation. The first Derby held in Queensland was held on this track in 1868. The establishment of a racecourse is part of the pattern of Gayndah's development as an early town, established in 1849 as a centre for the Burnett District. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Gayndah Racecourse is uncommon as a mid nineteenth century horse racing track in Queensland and may have been in longer continuous regular use as a race track than any other in Queensland. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Gayndah Racecourse is important for its social value to Jockey Club members, trainers, owners and jockeys and with generations of racegoers from all walks of life, both in the surrounding area and from further afield.

Don dislikes Paul's humorous ideas, and instead tells the staff to focus on the feeling of leaving the city, of adventure, of escape, of going somewhere you've never been, and about a stewardess in a short skirt. Don denigrates the idea that Creative needs to have more young people, but Roger insists. Don takes Betty to the Savoy Hotel for Valentine's Day. While there, they run into Juanita, an old roommate of Betty's from her modeling days, accompanied by a business executive. Betty fails to recognize what everyone else knows--Juanita is a call girl. Valentine's Day is not very happy--Trudy is crying because she is having trouble getting pregnant. In the Draper's hotel room, a more confident Betty shows Don a sexy merry widow she has gotten. The boldness throws Don, and when they try to have sex, he is impotent. The evening ends with Betty and Don watching the Jackie Kennedy TV special, A Tour of the White House with Mrs. John F. Kennedy. Also watching the special with their own significant others are Joan Holloway and her doctor-boyfriend, and Salvatore Romano, who is newly married. Pete sits alone watching it, eating the chocolate he'd purchased for his wife. The creative team is worried about the interviews to hire younger creative team members, and wonder about the power Duck Phillips has over Don. Ken Cosgrove scoffs and says that Don has a rope underneath his desk that is tied around Duck's neck and one day he's going to pull it. Don hires two young Creative team members, aged 24 and 25, both named Smith. Peggy and Salvatore meet with Don to show him mockups of the Mohawk campaign discussed. Don has changed his mind from his earlier sexy, adventuring Don, to one who is emphatic that it is not sex that sells, saying \\"You are the product. You, feeling something. That's what sells. Not them.\\" Now, he wants to emphasize in the ad a cute little girl running to the plane, not the short skirts of the stewardesses, with the copy \\"What did you bring me, Daddy?\\" Don pulls out the paper heart given to him by his daughter Sally for Valentine's Day. Meanwhile, Joan has been wondering where to put the new copier. When she hears that Peggy's cruel comments to Lois led to her crying in the break room, she realizes the perfect place to put the copier--Peggy's office. As the episode closes, the newly sentimental and attempting to be mature Don has arrived home in time for dinner, and he mails a copy of Meditations in an Emergency to someone, with the inscription \\"Made me think of you. ‚ÄìD.\\" Cultural references When Don is at a bar, a beatnik is reading the Frank O'Hara poetry collection Meditations in an Emergency, published in 1957. Don is later seen reading it as well. The episode title, \\"For Those Who Think Young\\", is a reference to a Pepsi slogan of the time. Don and Roger commiserate that kids today don't drink coffee, they prefer Pepsi and Frosted Flakes. At The Savoy, live musicians are playing The Song of the Indian Guest from Sadko by Rimsky-Korsakov. Referring to Juanita's life as an escort, Betty's friend mentions the film BUtterfield 8. Reception The episode was received positively by critics at the time. Alan Sepinwall, writing for New Jersey's The Star-Ledger, praised the episode, and the new season of questions it was setting up, saying \\"Matt Weiner has said that we're going to find out everything in due time; I'm more than willing to wait when the episodes are this strong.\\" Noel Murray, writing for The A.V. Club, was cautiously approving, writing that \\"If I have one major complaint about this first Season Two episode‚Äìaside from my usual complaints that Mad Men can hit its points a little too hard‚Äìit's that not much seems to have happened after 15 months. Aside from Betty's transformation into someone less lost and more imperious, the only major hint we get that this is all taking place over a year after the last episode is Don's voice-over quote from an O'Hara poem: 'Now I am quietly waiting for the catastrophe of my personality to become beautiful again.'\\" References External links * \\"For Those Who Think Young\\" at AMC * Mad Men (season 2) episodes 2008 American television episodes ","title":"For Those Who Think Young (Mad Men)"},{"id":"51388393","text":"Renato Luiz Louren√ßo Feliciano, known as Renato Sorriso, is a popular Brazilian street cleaner and samba dancer.Renato Sorriso: ‚ÄúMinha vassoura √© meu passaporte‚Äù Maur√≠cio Stycer - iG Colunistas, 14 February 2009 Beginning in 1995, he worked in Rio de Janeiro, for Comlurb (Companhia Municipal de Limpeza Urbana), the municipal urban cleaning company.Renato Sorriso: bom humor e simpatia na faculdade.

TEDES equipment is an integrated speed camera, red light camera and automatic number plate recognition device. Mounted beside or over a road, it detects violations of traffic regulation such as speeding and red light running. Other capabilities of TEDES are monitoring of driving on emergency stopping lane and parking violations. The system is linked to an automated ticketing service. Implementation The legal infrastructure for TEDES was enacted on December 9, 2015, as a supplement to the Highways Traffic Law (Act #2918). For the implementation, municipalities are made responsible. TEDES measures are executed by the Turkish National Police in the name of the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Finance. Municipalities receive 30% of the monthly revenues from the TEDES-related traffic fines for their expenses on installation and maintenance. TEDES is an integral part of the public area CCTV system (KGYS \\"Kent G√ºvenlik Y√∂netim Sistemi\\", literally: \\"City Security Management System\\") when this is already installed in the related city. Pilot experiment with TEDES started in √áerkezk√∂y, Tekirdaƒü Province in November 2013. Other cities in the country implemented the system later with Ordu being the first in November 2015. Ticketing The information collected by TEDES is converted to an administrative penalty decision. A traffic ticket constituting a fine assessed against the owner of the vehicle is sent per mail to the owner's address accompanied by an image of the vehicle taken during the violation, which shows the vehicle registration plate. The fine for speeding is categorized in two as exceeding the speed limit between 10% and 30%, and more than 30%. Forced red light violation in order to enable emergency vehicles with right-of-way, such as ambulances, fire engines and police cars, pass through is not charged. According to a court order, traffic law violations of a vehicle assessed by TEDES within five minutes can be charged once only. Arrival of the ticket per mail can take five to fifteen days. The existence of a ticket can be questioned online at the government's website by giving details of the related traffic registration certificate. The fine can be paid online at the website of the government's revenue administration. Controversy The income generated by ticketing the drivers is also shared with the municipalities where the system is commissioned.https://www.sabah.com.tr/yasam/2016/09/08/geliri-duyan-belediye- tedes-icin-sirada This generates incentive for municipalities to install TEDES on most abusive parts of the roads to increase the number of traffic violation tickets. Road safety It was reported that the number of traffic collisions at the TEDES-monitored intersections and fast lanes in Gaziantep declined by about 40% within two months of the implementation of TEDES in mid-April 2016. The average daily traffic law violation decreased from 3,500 in April 2016, to 1,500 in May and 1,200 in June of the same year. About 70% of the violations were speeding related.

Algae is extremely useful in various fields. An example for natural phycotechnology is the converting of atmospheric nitrogen into bioaccessible nitrogenous compounds by diazotrophic cyanobacteria (blue-green algae). Species of cyanobacteria like Nostoc, Arthrospira (Spirulina) and Aphanizomenon are used as food and feed due to their easy digestibility and nutrient content. Species of Dunaliella provide products like glycerol, carotenoids, and proteins. Algal-produced proteins can be biofactories for the production of therapeutic substances. Algae is also being used to assist in the remediation of pollution, to create bio-fuels, and as a bio-insecticide. Application Currently micro-algae are being exploited for environmental protection as the species of Chlorella, Chlamydomonas, and Scenedesmus carry out selective uptake, accumulation and biodegradation of pollutants and thus help in remediation. They are used in biological reclamation of sewage since they can immobilize heavy metals from aquatic systems. Microalgae can be used as biocontrol agents like 'Insect' a commercial bio-insecticide sold in USA, prepared from the dead biomass of diatom frustules. Microalgae are of significant use in healthcare. Chlorellin from the green microalga Chlorella is an effective antibiotic against Gram positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Algae are an excellent feed stock for green fuel as they are used for the production of biodiesel, bioethanol, biogasoline, biomethanol, biobutanol, and recently biohydrogen. The full genome sequences of many species of cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae have been used for evolutionary studies and the identification and comparison of the genes coding for specific proteins. Collections of cDNAs and ESTs also aid in genomic research by providing fast and inexpensive ways to discover new genes and their functions and map their positions on chromosomes. Many species of diatoms are used for synthesizing nanoparticles and are being explored for their use as drug delivery systems.

It was built from 1914 to 1917. It is also known as Yarrol Road State School. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The former Ventnor State School was originally constructed as an open-air school in 1914 in Maryborough. The school was located at Teddington Road, Tinana and opened on 11 November 1914. As an open-air structure, the school was an example of one of the experimental designs for state primary schools instigated by the Department of Works in 1914. The schools were a response to the advocacy that suggested maximum ventilation was necessary for a school building. Open-air schools were constructed for only a short period and were not to become a permanent feature of Queensland's State School architecture. The problems associated with these schools outweighed the advantages and by 1922 the open- air school was phased out and more traditional designs reappeared. By 1917 a new school building was constructed for the school at Tinana, now Parke State School, and the old open-air school was used as a play shed. In 1929 an application was made for a school at Wongalee and the old open-air school at Tinana was transported to Wongalee. School commenced at Wongalee on 21 September 1929 and in 1932 permission was granted for the construction of a play shed. It is likely that the open-air school was enclosed at this time along with the addition of a skillion-roofed verandah. In April 1945 R.M. Marshall delivered an application to the Department of Public Instruction in the Yarrol Road area. The application was approved and Tim Maloney, then owner of portion 111, donated three acres to the Secretary of Public Instruction on 25 September 1945 as the site for the new school. The school which had been moved to Wongalee was once again removed and transported to its present site at Yarrol Road, Ventnor. The Yarrol Road State School (at it was then called) commenced classes on 3 June 1946 with Doreen Turner as teacher. In July 1948 it was renamed Ventnor State School. The school continued operate until 22 April 1960 when it was closed due to low enrolment numbers. In 1963, local residents made an offer of ¬£150 to purchase the school from the Department of Education and the property was transferred to the Ventnor Progress Association on 15 March 1963. Since that time the school complex has been used as headquarters for the progress association, for religious group services, farming and pastoral bodies and fire control groups and was regularly used as a polling booth. The Ventnor Progress Association continues to own and maintain the premises.  Description  The former Ventnor State School is located on Yarrol Road, Ventnor. The school site consists of a one-room school building with verandah, a play shed, a girls' and boys' toilet, remnants of an old swing post and a flagpole. The block of land is a flat piece in a bush setting surrounded by a fence with steel cyclone mesh gates. New plantings along the front fence are memorials to donors and life members of the Progress Association. The school building is a simple structure of timber with a corrugated iron hipped roof truncated where a skillion-roofed verandah has been added on its western side. The building sits on low timber stumps and a small set of stairs on the eastern side gains entrance to the classroom. The walls are timber tongue-and-groove vertical joints and the schoolroom has sliding 6 pane windows on three walls. The room has a coved timber ceiling with a central lattice vent and a large timber support beam across the width of the room. The room contains some of its original desks and chairs dating from 1946 as well as other original pieces such as framed embroidery by former students. A doorway gains access to the verandah at the front of the room on the western side. The verandah contains evidence of hooks used for hanging school bags on its rear walls. There is a small storeroom located at the front of the verandah. The play shed is adjacent to the school building on the verandah side. It is a pole frame structure with a corrugated iron roof, two walls and dirt floor. The play shed contains the original timber bar which was used for holding the school children's saddles during the school day. The two toilets are located at opposite corners of the western side of the site and are timber framed structures with corrugated iron roofs and comprises a cubicle and entry.  Heritage listing  Ventnor State School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Ventnor State School is important in demonstrating the development of Queensland's state education system, in particular its response to the needs of small rural communities in the first half of the twentieth century. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The former Ventnor State School demonstrates the principal characteristics of an early 20th century school complex including the play shed, toilets and single room school building. Although the school building has been enclosed, the building is important as a remaining example of an original open-air school which were a feature of schooling in Queensland from about 1914 to 1922. The open-air school was a standard design implemented by the Department of Works in 1914 in response to climate and the need for ventilation. The open-air school was a testament to the experimentation undertaken by the Department of Works in relation to developing suitable school environments for Queensland children. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The school has aesthetic significance as a well-kept, small-scale complex in a bush setting with structures that complement each other in size and form. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The former Ventnor State School has a special association with the local community as a place of education and community gathering since 1946. It also has special association with past generations of school communities from Tinana and Wongalee, having operated as a state primary school at both these locations.

A History of the Royal New Zealand Army Ordnance Corps. . Early life Tucker entered Royal Navy service at the Plymouth Yard on 29 November 1802, initially as a Shipwright apprentice under the Master Measurer. Tucker completed his apprenticeship on 14 December 1811, when he then became the Clerk to the Master Measurer, remaining in this role until 1822. This was a role of some responsibility requiring above-average literacy and numeracy skills and would have provided Tucker with intimate knowledge of the behind the scenes logistic workings of the Royal Navy. On 16 November 1817 Tucker married Elizabeth Howell (1795‚Äì1844) at South Wraxall, Wiltshire, England. It is known that their union produced a daughter Emma Mary who was born in 1829 (died 1859) and a son, William Tucker who was born on 5 January 1843. Elizabeth died on 16 December 1844, and Tucker remarried on 20 December 1845 to Emily Shell. Tucker, with a wife to support, must have decided that a career as a purser would be a profitable and logical path of advancement. At that time pursers were warranted by the Admiralty but did not require professional qualifications. However, some kind of financial surety was required; 20 years as Clerk to a Master Measurer provided that. The duties of a purser were to oversee supply and issue of victuals, slops and other consumables. The purser was one of the five standing officers of the ship. (A standing officer was permanently assigned to a ship.) The purser's position presented many opportunities to the canny to enrich himself, often at the expense of the crew. Bligh of fame, served as his own purser, with the actual work falling to his clerk. The regulations of the Royal Navy demanded that individuals aspiring to become pursers serve at least one year as a captain's clerk, which Tucker completed on HMS Calliope, and in 1825 he obtained his promotion to the rank of Purser and Paymaster. In 1828 Tucker was the purser aboard , an 18-gun brig-sloop which was then part of the Royal Navy Barbados Station in the Caribbean, undertaking anti-piracy and anti-slavery patrols. In 1840 Tucker was the purser and paymaster on HMS Buffalo, which whilst anchored in Mercury Bay off Whitianga, loaded with kauri spars, was wrecked in a storm on 28 July 1840. Given the remoteness of New Zealand at that time, Tucker was, along with the rest of the crew of HMS Buffalo, stranded in New Zealand, with the choice to either settle or find passage on the next available ship out. Career in New Zealand In 1840 New Zealand became a Crown Colony separate from New South Wales. William Hobson, the incoming governor, requested that Tucker remain in the colony and undertake the office of colonial storekeeper. To this Tucker consented, occupying that position from 19 December 1840 to 1844 when the position was cancelled. In the new colony, the role of colonial storekeeper was a key position within the quickly expanding colonial administration. The storekeeper's responsibility was to support the colonial administration with its logistical needs. Imperial troops in New Zealand were the responsibility of the Board of Ordnance, with which no doubt Tucker had a close working relationship. Records show that Tucker as colonial storekeeper was purchasing all manner of goods including tents, blankets, stationery, printing supplies, building products, animals and feed. A primary duty of the storekeeper was to store and issue arms to settlers' militia should the need arise. By December 1842 Tucker had the following in store: *46 bayonets, *53 Muskets, *2 Cannonades 18pr, *3 Cannons, and *3 Camp ovens. In late 1843 the Colonial Secretary of New Zealand deemed the position of Colonial Storekeeper as unnecessary and the position was to be cancelled. This was seen as an unpopular move and was questioned by the newspapers of the day, as Tucker was a popular individual in the community, and especially in the light that as soon as he was made redundant, a Mr Leach was appointed, under a different job title to the office of Colonial Storekeeper. The duties of the Colonial Storekeeper were in time assumed by the Superintendent of Public Works. No longer Colonial Storekeeper, Tucker remained in Government service first as the Chief Clerk Audit from 17 February 1844, and on 24 July 1844 he was appointed as the Chief Clerk, Governor's private affairs. On 8 August 1846 it was announced in the nation's newspapers that Tucker was to be released from Government service. Judging by the newspaper articles of the time, Tucker was a well respected public servant and there was some disappointment that he was released from public service. Final years Late in 1846 Tucker returned to England, where he was shortly afterwards appointed Paymaster and Purser of HMS Acheron, a Hermes-class wooden paddle sloop of the Royal Navy. Whilst Acheron was undertaking a coastal survey of New Zealand, ill-health compelled Tucker to relinquish his post aboard this vessel. Years of service had greatly impaired his constitution, which rapidly gave way, and for the last three or four months he suffered with much fortitude and resignation despite being in great pain, until he died on 26 August 1850 in Auckland, New Zealand. Having been so recently on active service and a much respected public figure in the colony, Tucker's funeral was a martial affair: the coffin, covered with the Union Jack, and surmounted with his hat and sword, carried to the grave by a party of blue jackets landed for that purpose from HMS Fly. The funeral party included his son, the Governor of the New Zealand Colony, senior military officials and a long and highly respectable train of civilians and former shipmates from HMS Buffalo. Tucker is buried at the Symonds Street Cemetery in central Auckland. The Daily Southern Cross newspaper summarised Henry Tucker as: > The late Mr Tucker may, without the smallest approach to monument or eulogy, > be affirmed to have been a worthy, upright man. Sailors are accurate judges > of character, and the soubriquet ‚Äì \\"Honest\\" Ben Tucker\\" ‚Äì which, according > to Captain Edward Stanley was the appellation given him by his messmates, > proved the high estimation in which he was held. Legacy As the first colonial storekeeper of New Zealand, Henry Tucker has been adopted as the godfather of the New Zealand Army's Supply Trades. The former Royal New Zealand Army Ordnance Corps named its unofficial Senior NCO, Warrant Officer and Officer social and professional development club \\"The Henry Tucker Club\\", a tradition which has carried over to the Royal New Zealand Army Logistic Regiment. Today his name adorns lecture rooms at the Supply Wing of the NZ Army Trade Training School and is also used as the name of the a combined exercise and field phase of the Supply Technician RNZALR, Intermediate and Senior Supply courses.

Source code compiled using deterministic compilation will always output the same binary. Reproducible builds can act as part of a chain of trust; the source code can be signed, and deterministic compilation can prove that the binary was compiled from trusted source code. Methods For the compilation process to be deterministic, the input to the compiler must be the same, regardless of the build environment used. This typically involves normalizing variables that may change, such as order of input files, timestamps, locales, and paths. Additionally, the compilers must not introduce non-determinism themselves. This sometimes happens when using hash tables with a random hash seed value. It can also happen when using the address of variables because that varies from address space layout randomization (ASLR). Build systems, such as Bazel and Gitian, can be used to automate deterministic build processes. History The GNU project used reproducible builds in the early 1990s. Changelogs from 1992 indicate the ongoing effort. One of the older projects to promote reproducible builds is the Bitcoin project with Gitian. Later, in 2013, the Tor (anonymity network) project started using Gitian for their reproducible builds.Deterministic Builds Part Two: Technical Details.

The name was changed in 2013 and became Pydio (an acronym for Put Your Data in Orbit). In May 2018, Pydio switched from PHP to Go with the release of Pydio Cells. PHP version reached end-of-life state on 31 December, 2019. Pydio runs on any server supporting a recent Go version. The current offering of Pydio, known as Pydio Cells, has been developed from scratch using the Go programming language. Nevertheless, the web-based interface of Cells is very similar to the one from Pydio 8 (in PHP), and it successfully replicates most of the features, while adding a few more. There is also a new synchronisation client (also written in Go). The PHP version is being phased out as the company's focus is moving to Pydio Cells, with community feedback on the new features. According to the company, the switch to the new environment was made \\"to overcome inherent PHP limitations and provide you with a future-proof and modern solution for collaborating on documents\\". From a technical point of view, Pydio differs from solutions such as Google Drive or Dropbox. Pydio is not based on a public cloud, the software indeed connects to the user's existing storages (SAN / Local FS, SAMBA / CIFS, (s)FTP, NFS, etc...) as well as to the existing user directories (LDAP / AD, SAML, Radius, Shibboleth...), which allows companies to keep their data inside their infrastructure, according to their data security policy and user rights management.

Her main contributions to astronomy were works on stellar occultations by the moon, measures of double stars and astrometric measurements, as well as the determination of the passage of stars through two verticals. She accomplished all of this while she was working at the Observatory of the University of Santiago de Compostela (USC). Before the Spanish Civil War, she obtained degrees in chemistry and pharmacy from the USC, earned her teaching diploma and studied Exact Sciences, the name for mathematics, for two years. She obtained her degree in mathematics in the Complutense University of Madrid some years later. In 1963 she became the first Spanish woman to defend a thesis that addressed the issue of astronomy: Observaciones de pasos por dos verticales (in English, Observations of passages of stars through two verticals). This thesis was also the first defended in the Faculty of Mathematics of the USC. Economic hardship forced her to study and work at the same time, but she earned scholarships that helped her reach her academic goals.  Biography  = Early years = Antonia Ferr√≠n Moreiras was born in Ourense on May 13, 1914, and was the third of four daughters. Contrary to the conventions of the time, and despite the limited economic resources of the family, her father, a mathematics teacher, wanted all his daughtersAntonia, Celsa, Mar√≠a and Pastora, to have access to higher-level studies, so the family moved to Santiago de Compostela in 1920. Ferr√≠n started school when she was seven years old and at only nine years old, she was ready to start high school. She did the Scientific Bachillerato, which is the stage of education for people over the age of 16 in Spain. After that, she studied the University Bachillerato, since admission to the university required the completion of this education stage, with twelve other girls. = Higher education and professional career = Ferrin started her higher education studies in the Faculty of Sciences of the USC, at a time when chemistry was the only major offered. Even though her father worked in the Faculty of Pharmacy, his income was not enough, so she obtained free tuition and scholarships. With such financial support, she could earn a degree in chemistry and the title of Schoolteacher in 1935. She started working immediately after she graduated, but her first jobs were not paid. From 1934 to 1936, Ferr√≠n worked as training assistant teacher of physics and mathematics in the Faculty of Sciences of the USC and as temporary assistant teacher in the Department of Science of the high school Arcebispo Xelm√≠rez in Santiago de Compostela. At the same time, she was pursuing a pharmacy degree and the only two courses of Exact Sciences that the USC offered. In 1937, she started working as mathematics teacher in the orphan girls‚Äô school Nuestra Se√±ora de los Remedios, a position she held until 1948. In 1937, after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, she was sanctioned because of her political convictions, and an anonymous complaint lead to the opening of her file. As a result, she was removed from her duties as university teacher along with 45 other teachers. In 1940, however, she got her case reviewed, the sentence was revoked and she could teach again. After her removal, she restarted teaching at the university and sometimes she gave lessons in the girls' school until 1961. During the academic year 1939‚Äì1940, Ferrin completed the prerequisite courses for the pharmacy degree. It was during this time that she met Ram√≥n Mar√≠a Aller, the founder and director of the Astronomical Observatory of the USC, and the person who made it possible for her to become the first female Galician astronomer. In that observatory, Ferr√≠n started to use the passage instrument and the refracting telescope, which allowed her to visualize the concealment of stars by the moon, the passage of stars through two verticals, or micrometric measurements of double stars. The results of these investigations were published in the Spanish magazine of astronomy, Urania. Ferr√≠n recalled anecdotally that it was really cold while she was doing her research in the observatory. She never wore trousers because, according to her, it was a piece of clothing that ‚Äúwas not considered feminine and only the more daring movie actresses wore them on the big screen.‚Äù In 1950, she received a scholarship from the Spanish National Research Council to conduct research in the Astronomical Observatory of Santiago. This scholarship became a contract of research assistantship two years later. In the same year, she obtained a degree in mathematics from the Complutense University of Madrid, even though she was a guest student for the last three courses of the degree. In 1953, she passed the civil service examinations for professor of mathematics in the Escuela de Magisterio of Santander. However, two years later, she transferred to the girls‚Äô school Isabel la Cat√≥lica of Santiago. From 1954 until 1956 she studied to earn a doctorate in astronomy in Madrid. In the meantime, she helped professor Vidal Abascal to create the degree in mathematics in the Faculty of Sciences of the USC, a feat accomplished in 1957. Ferr√≠n became the first female professor of this faculty. During this time, she continued her research under the direction of Ram√≥n Mar√≠a Aller. The thesis that she defended in 1963 with the help of Aller, even though he was 80 years old, was probably her greatest accomplishment not only because it was the first read in the Faculty of Mathematics of the USC, but also the first one defended by a woman addressing the issue of astronomy in Spain. In 1963, she was appointed as full-time professor of mathematics in the Escuela de Magisterio Santa Mar√≠a in Madrid and she also worked as professor of mathematics in the degree of medicine for two years. In addition, she taught astronomy and celestial mechanics, she served in management, and sat on the selection boards. She also participated in the first international meetings of mathematics that were carried out in Spain. However, in spite of her great professional career, being a woman sometimes stood in the way of her aspirations. For example, when Aller got sick in 1964, a substitute was needed so that Aller‚Äôs chair of astronomy in the observatory could continue. Even though she applied for the public examination, she was excluded. She was considered as an applicant following a complaint, but the chair was declared void and the observatory deteriorated. Ferr√≠n retired in 1984.  Honors  On May 24, 2008, she was proclaimed as the patroness of the fiftieth anniversary of the Faculty of Mathematics of the USC. = Eponymous = * Lecture room of the Faculty of Mathematics of the USC. * Award for the creation of education materials and resources with gender perspective in the University of Vigo.

The eruption triggered the sudden release of about 100,000‚Äì300,000 tons (1.6 million tons, according to some sources) of carbon dioxide (). The gas cloud initially rose at nearly and then, being heavier than air, descended onto nearby villages, displacing all the air and suffocating people and livestock within of the lake. A degassing system has since been installed at the lake, with the aim of reducing the concentration of in the waters and therefore the risk of further eruptions.  Eruption and gas cloud  It is not known what triggered the catastrophic outgassing. Most geologists suspect a landslide, but some believe that a small volcanic eruption may have occurred on the bed of the lake. A third possibility is that cool rainwater falling on one side of the lake triggered the overturn. Others still believe there was a small earthquake, but because witnesses did not report feeling any tremors on the morning of the disaster, this hypothesis is unlikely. The event resulted in the supersaturated deep water rapidly mixing with the upper layers of the lake, where the reduced pressure allowed the stored CO2 to effervesce out of solution. It is believed that about of gas was released. The normally blue waters of the lake turned a deep red after the outgassing, due to iron-rich water from the deep rising to the surface and being oxidised by the air. The level of the lake dropped by about a metre and trees near the lake were knocked down. Scientists concluded from evidence that a column of water and foam formed at the surface of the lake, spawning a wave of at least that swept the shore on one side. Since carbon dioxide is 1.5 times the density of air, the cloud hugged the ground and moved down the valleys, where there were various villages. The mass was about thick, and travelled downward at . For roughly , the gas cloud was concentrated enough to suffocate many people in their sleep in the villages of Nyos, Kam, Cha, and Subum. About 4,000 inhabitants fled the area, and many of these developed respiratory problems, lesions, and paralysis as a result of the gas cloud. Lake Nyos disaster, Cameroon, 1986: the medical effects of large scale emission of carbon dioxide?, BMJ, Volume 298, May 27, 1989, It is a possibility that other volcanic gases were released along with the CO2, as some survivors reported a smell of gunpowder or rotten eggs which indicates that sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide were present at concentrations above their odour thresholds. However, CO2 was the only gas detected in samples of lake water, suggesting that this was the predominant gas released and as such the main cause of the incident.  Effects on survivors  Cattle suffocated by carbon dioxide from Lake Nyos One survivor, Joseph Nkwain from Subum, described himself when he awoke after the gases had struck: > \\"I could not speak. I became unconscious. I could not open my mouth because > then I smelled something terrible ... I heard my daughter snoring in a > terrible way, very abnormal ... When crossing to my daughter's bed ... I > collapsed and fell. I was there till nine o'clock in the (Friday) morning > ... until a friend of mine came and knocked at my door ... I was surprised > to see that my trousers were red, had some stains like honey. I saw some ... > starchy mess on my body. My arms had some wounds ... I didn't really know > how I got these wounds ... I opened the door ... I wanted to speak, my > breath would not come out ... My daughter was already dead ... I went into > my daughter's bed, thinking that she was still sleeping.

Following the eruption, many survivors were treated at the main hospital in Yaound√©, the country's capital. It was believed that many of the victims had been poisoned by a mixture of gases that included hydrogen and sulfur. Poisoning by these gases would lead to burning pains in the eyes and nose, coughing and signs of asphyxiation similar to being strangled.  Aftermath  The scale of the disaster led to much study on how a recurrence could be prevented. Several researchers proposed the installation of degassing columns from rafts in the middle of the lake. The principle is to slowly vent the by lifting heavily saturated water from the bottom of the lake through a pipe, initially by using a pump, but only until the release of gas inside the pipe naturally lifts the column of effervescing water, making the process self- sustaining.Degassing Lake Nyos project http://pagesperso- orange.fr/mhalb/nyos/nyos.htm Starting from 1995, feasibility studies were successfully conducted, and the first permanent degassing tube was installed at Lake Nyos in 2001. Two additional pipes were installed in 2011. Following the Lake Nyos disaster, scientists investigated other African lakes to see if a similar phenomenon could happen elsewhere. Lake Kivu in the Democratic Republic of Congo, 2,000 times larger than Lake Nyos, was also found to be supersaturated, and geologists found evidence that outgassing events around the lake happened about every thousand years. In popular culture A Greek novel by Basileios Drolias focusing on the Lake Nyos disaster and the degassing of the lake was published in 2016.

Hamri represented Algeria at two Summer Paralympics, winning a silver in the long jump at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London and a bronze in the same event four years later in Rio de Janeiro. Hamri has also won two silver medals at the IPC World Championships, both in the long jump, at Lyon in 2013 and at Doha in 2015. Personal history Hamri was born in Bab El-Oued, Algeria in 1989. She was born with a congenital eye condition, maculopathy, which is a deteriorating illness that effects her vision. Hamri comes from a large family of six sisters; one of which has the same eye condition. Sporting career Hamri was described as a childhood tomboy by her mother, and enjoyed playing football with the other children in her neighbourhood. When the Tadjar family moved into their building, their daughter, who was an athletics coach, spotted in potential in Hamri. After her first training session Hamri fell for the sport, and spent the next few years moving through different clubs, but it was later noticed that her vision began to deteriorate and her illness was confirmed by a doctor. Due to her failing eyesight, Hamri was classified as a T13 athlete and in 2007 she represented Algeria at her first major international competition, the 2007 All-Africa Games, where she won a bronze medal in the long jump. The high-point of her career came at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London, where she qualified for both the 100 metre sprint (T13) and the long jump (F13). Despite posting a season's best in the sprint, Hamri was unable to progress through to the finals. Her efforts in the long jump paid greater dividends with a distance of 5.31m winning her the silver medal. Further success followed over two successive IPC Athletics World Championships, 2013 in Lyon and 2015 in Doha where, now classified as a T12 athlete due to her condition worsening, she won two silver medals in the long jump event. At the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, Hamri again entered the 100 metre sprint and the long jump. In the 100 metre heats, she qualified as a fastest losing athlete, but then failed to qualify through the semi-finals. Her success, as in London, came through the long jump, where she finished in bronze medal position, with a jump of 5.53 metres.

He plays catcher for the Hanshin Tigers. Early Baseball Career A native of Saitama Prefecture, Fumihito began playing baseball in fourth grade, and went on to play for the Yorii Little Seniors (currently the Fukaya Saihoku Little Seniors) in junior high. But it wasn't until his second year in Teikyo High School that he switched permanently to the catcher role. When his school represented Eastern Tokyo in the 2009 Summer Koshien, he batted clean-up and averaged 0.385 in 3 games, helping his team reach the semi-finals. Despite not winning the championship, his performance at the plate and experience as a catcher earned him a spot in the national team for the US-Japan High School Baseball Tournament. According to an interview, he was so passionate about baseball that even after his classes, various club activities, and a 4-hour commute to his school in Tokyo and back to Saitama, he would spend hours into the night practicing with his father's home-made batting cage in their backyard. Hanshin Tigers  He was the Hanshin Tiger's 6th round pick in the autumn 2009 professional draft. He signed an initial 30-million contract for an annual salary of 4.8 million yen, and was assigned the jersey number 52. Farm Leagues (2010-2015) He batted 0.143 in nine Western League (farm) games during his first year. The following year, his performance improved, and though still at the farm, he was given more chances at the plate. He finished the season with a BA of 0.329, 26 hits, 11 RBIs and 2 home runs. Due to recurring hip injuries throughout the 2012 season, he only managed to appear in 16 games, and finished with a 0.189 BA and 5 RBIs. Because he was unable to make it to the main roster for three years, he was released from his contract at the end of the season, and was instead offered to sign a 1-year Ikusei (development) contract, and his jersey number changed to 124. 2013 was another injury-plagued year for Haraguchi, as a pitch fractured his left hand during a batting practice. He only managed to play in 17 farm games for the entire season, but luckily, the Tigers decided to renew his Ikusei contract for another year.„ÄÇ 2014 and 2015 proved to be better seasons as he appeared in more and more games. However, his performance at the plate, while enough to keep his contract getting renewed, still failed to earn him a spot in the main roster. 2016 With a new manager coming in, the 2016 season proved to be the break-out year for Haraguchi. He was assigned to train with the main squad during spring camp, and played all the way until the pre-season exhibition games. On April 27, the team decided to promote him to the main roster, assigned him the jersey number 94, and straight away called him to his first match. He debuted as a pinch-hitter on the bottom of the 5th in the Giants match at Koshien, remained as catcher, and scored his first hit as a pro on the 8th inning against Kazuto Taguchi. The following day, he scored the 2-base hit that tied the game in the bottom of the ninth, preventing the Giants to win as the game ended in a draw until the 12th. Because of his sudden assignment to the main squad and jersey number change, he borrowed the uniform of 2nd-squad coach Katsuhiko Yamada (no.82) for two games until he was given his proper jersey with number 94. He alternated as a catcher and first baseman in the following week, while his continued success at the plate eventually led him to bat clean-up in some games. He even notched a walk-off hit in the May 19 game against the Dragons. At the end of May, he was awarded the Central League MVP of the month for recording a batting average of 0.380, and hitting 17 RBIs including 5 home runs. He became the first Ikusei contract player in Japanese baseball history to get this award, and the 1st Hanshin catcher in 41 years to do so. Due to his consistent delivery on the plate, he became the first NPB player from an Ikusei contract to get nominated in the mid-season All Star Game. But as he began to experience pain in his right shoulder, his appearances were gradually reduced during the later half of the season. Out of 107 games, he finished with a batting average of 0.299, 46 RBIs including 11 home runs. His notable performance earned him a 17.2 million yen pay raise, bringing his annual salary to 22 million yen, the biggest player salary percentage increase (358%) in team history.„ÄÇ 2017 On March 1, he announced his marriage with a nursery school teacher from his home town in Saitama. This is also his first time to start the year in the main squad. While he trained both as a catcher and 1st baseman, he was groomed more towards being the replacement of the regular 1st baseman Mauro Gomez whose contract was not renewed for 2017. While still registered as a catcher, he joined the starting line up as 1st baseman at the start of the season. On the April 6 game against the Swallows, he hit his first home run of the season during overtime to win the game. This was his first career walk-off home run as a pro. But due to his inconsistent batting, he got alternated on the post with fellow catcher-turned-first-baseman Masahiro Nakatani. With his deteriorating performance and Nakatani's continuous improvement, his starts gradually became fewer mid-season (mostly as a pinch-hitter or substitute catcher), and he finally got sent back to the farm on August 26. As he battled with pain in his left torso, he never made it back to the main squad, and finished the season with 25 RBIs and an average of 0.226 in 73 games. His salary decreased to 20 million yen by the end of the season. 2018 At the start of the season, he and Umeno alternated as the starting catcher, but he gradually progressed as the team's go-to pinch hitter as he demonstrated a knack for clutch hitting. 57 out of his 82-game appearances were as a pinch hitter where he batted a remarkable 0.404. His performance was even better with runners in scoring position, where he averaged 0.455 throughout the season. By mid-September, he was two hits away from beating the team record of most hits by a pinch hitter in a season (23 hits, recorded by Shinjiro Hiyama in 2008), but he was taken off the roster when he injured his left hand on September 14. He made a full recovery in time for the October 5 match against the Dragons, and tied the pinch hit record in the 8th inning to the delight of the home crowd in Koshien. With this, he became the team's only right-handed batter with the most pinch hits, and the 3rd player in NPB history with the most pinch hits in one season (tied with Hiyama). Personal life At the end of the 2018 season, he was diagnosed with colorectal cancer during a year-end health check. He underwent surgery a few weeks later, and on January 31, he announced on social media that his surgery was successful and posted another tweet six days later saying he had left the hospital.

The priest originated from Livorno where he served as a parish priest for several decades in addition to his role as a caregiver for prostitutes and ill people ‚Äì he distinguished himself during an 1835 cholera epidemic that claimed his sister. He had the esteem of other noted individuals including Grand Duke Leopoldo II and Juliette Colbert. The beatification process commenced under Pope John Paul II in 1994 after he was titled as a Servant of God and the process culminated on 3 March 2016 after Pope Francis confirmed his life of heroic virtue and titled him as Venerable. Life Giovanni Battista Quilici was born in Livorno on 26 April 1791 to Bernardo Quilici and Chiara Sgallini; he was baptized on 27 April at the San Francesco Cattedrale and he later received his Confirmation in 1798. The Barnabites from the church of San Sebastiano and the Dominicans from the church of Santa Caterina oversaw his education in his childhood and adolescence. In 1811 he and his close friend Pietro Paolo Stefanini decided to become postulants in the Dominicans but the subsequent suppression of the Dominicans ‚Äì due to Napoleon Bonaparte's invasion of the Italian peninsula ‚Äì interrupted their plans to join and to enter the priesthood. His father died in 1811. He was ordained as a priest on 13 April 1816 ‚Äì Holy Saturday. Quilici served as an assistant pastor at San Sebastiano for two decades. In his ecclesiastical career he decided to dedicate himself to the social and moral outcasts of Livorno and this included people such as prisoners and prostitutes. He founded the Evangelical Workers and the Fathers of Families in 1820 as a means to instruct the faithful in catechism while also tending to the sick and instructing children in religious education. From 1828 until 1835 he started to build up and lead the Istituto della Carit√† di Santa Maria Maddalena which he established on 18 August 1828. This institute materialized after several meetings with Grand Duke Leopoldo II and Juliette Colbert ‚Äì future Venerable. In 1829 he began the construction of the church of Santi Pietro e Paolo and construction was completed in 1835; in 1837 he became its first rector and parish priest. In 1837 ‚Äì a few months after ‚Äì he refused to become a canon penitentiary of the Livorno Cathedral to devote himself to his new parish church. He distinguished himself during an 1835 cholera epidemic that claimed the life of his sister and his new church was used as a kind of field hospital for those suffering from the disease; he himself contracted the disease but was treated for it. The duke awarded him a gold medal for his services during the epidemic. He founded his religious order ‚Äì the Daughters of the Crucified on 12 September 1840. He referred to the women of his order as his \\"little girls\\". Quilici's decision to establish a religious congregation prompted Colbert to found one of her own in Turin. In 1843 one of his relatives attacked him to take possession of his funds intended for the poor. In 1844 Leopold II offered him the Cross of Saint Joseph but Quilici refused because he deemed it unimportant; the duke wanted to change it to an economic contribution but the priest had died before he could receive it. Quilici died at 5:00pm on the Feast of Corpus Christi on 10 June 1844 after he fell ill with a high fever at the beginning of the month. His funeral was celebrated on 11 June 1844 and his remains were later transferred in 1932. His order received the papal decree of praise from Pope Pius IX on 15 January 1853 and later received full approval from Pope Leo XIII in 1882. The order was later aggregated to the Order of Saint Augustine on 11 October 1898. The order now exists in Peru and as of 2008 there were 14 houses and a total of 92 religious in them. Beatification Tomb in Livorno. In mid-1985 a gathering of priests for a conference in Livorno requested Bishop Alberto Ablondi to consider the potential for a canonization cause for the late priest and on 27 April 1992 a formal request was made to Ablondi that a process soon be initiated. The cause commenced in Livorno under Pope John Paul II on 21 January 1994 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" ('nothing against') to the cause and titled Quilici as a Servant of God. Ablondi inaugurated the diocesan process on 17 June 1994 and oversaw its successful conclusion on 20 June 1998. The C.C.S. issued validation to this process in Rome on 12 November 1999 and received the official Positio dossier from the postulation in 2013. The historians met to assess the cause and issued their approval to it in a session held on 10 December 2013 while theologians followed this decision on 20 October 2015. The cardinal and bishop members likewise came to the same conclusion on 1 March 2016. On 3 March 2016 he was proclaimed to be Venerable after Pope Francis confirmed that the late Quilici had lived a model Christian life of heroic virtue.

Prior to 2018, CEO was held in Orlando, Florida. Introduced in 2010 and organized by Alex Jebailey, the event is known for its strong ties to the fighting game community. Fighting game players compete in a wrestling ring during the event's tournaments, and CEO has been a mainstay of the Capcom Pro Tour since its establishment in 2014. An annual side-event titled CEOtaku was initiated in 2015. Background Described in 2016 as one of the biggest fighting game community events in the United States by Red Bull, CEO has been running annually since 2010 and has grown exponentially every year. Organized by Alex Jebailey, the event is known primarily for emphasizing community spirit. Jebailey's goal for CEO is to ensure the entertainment of all its attendees. The event has an \\"infamous\\" wrestling ring in which tournament players compete and those who reach the finals make \\"WWE style entrances\\". Jebailey himself has been interested in video game competition since 1993, when he won a local Street Fighter II Turbo tournament on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. He has competed in various tournaments during the 1990s and 2000s, including Mortal Kombat and Killer Instinct competitions, as well as professional trading card game contests. Here, he got the inspiration and experience to become a tournament organizer. Jebailey joined Iron Galaxy in 2014. History =2010-2013= In 2010, there was a fighting game event that was \\"supposed to\\" happen in Orlando, but things did not come together until Alex Jebailey was assigned as Tournament Organizer three weeks prior to when the event was planned. He named the event 'Community Effort Orlando', managed the tournament brackets on his own, and ran the stream with one colleague. Florida was not known for having an active fighting game community, though the 2010 open tournament totaled 300 players. CEO was held on June 10-12 in 2011. Orlando Business Journal reported in 2012 that CEO was growing steadily, having reached 1,600 attendees and 30,000 online viewers. Jebailey stated that his presence on social media such as Twitter and Facebook has allowed the event to grow in size. At this point, CEO was part of the \\"Road to Evo\\" series of major ranking events. CEO 2013 had over 1,800 attendees. The day after winning a CEO tournament, Marvel vs. Capcom 3 player Noel Brown was arrested for domestic abuse after attacking a fellow tournament player. =2014= CEO was held on June 27-29 in 2014 and was one of the ten Premier Events of the first annual Capcom Pro Tour, meaning that high-ranking players of the Ultra Street Fighter IV tournament at CEO could qualify for the 2014 Capcom Cup. CEO 2014 was also sponsored by One Frame Link, and Jebailey sold CEO-themed T-shirts based on the various games played during the event in order to crowdfund the prize pool of each tournament. =2015= CEO, taking place on June 26-28, was one of the sixteen Capcom Pro Tour events of the 2015 season, and the winner of its Ultra Street Fighter IV tournament automatically qualified for the 2015 Capcom Cup. Capcom revealed the first playable demo of Street Fighter V at CEO 2015. Held at the Wyndham Orlando Resort, CEO 2015 brought in over 3,000 attendees. At the CEO 2015 Ultra Street Fighter IV tournament, well-known players such as Infiltration, Tokido, Yusuke Momochi, and Daigo Umehara were all eliminated before reaching the finals. The tournament was won by Kazunoko, who beat 801 Strider in the winner's bracket semi-final and defeated Fuudo in the Grand Final. As a response to the consistent success of Super Smash Bros.-player Gonzalo \\"ZeRo\\" Barrios throughout the 2015 season, Jebailey gave out a prize to whoever could knock him out of the CEO 2015 tournament. As a response, Smashboards owner Chris \\"AlphaZealot\\" Brown added more money to the \\"bounty\\". Regardless, ZeRo won the tournament, defeating Nairoby \\"Nairo\\" Quezada in the Grand Final. =2016= CEO 2016 took place two weeks after the Orlando nightclub shooting. Jebailey quickly responded to people's worries regarding personal safety on social media that he would redouble the event's security. In an interview with Red Bull, Jebailey stated that \\"We understand bad things happen in the world, but if I can spend a weekend with my community and get away from it... I can‚Äôt imagine anything better.\\" CEO 2016, again a Capcom Pro Tour Premier Event, featured ten major fighting game tournaments, including Ultra Street Fighter IV side-to-side with Street Fighter V. Jebailey stated in an interview that there was a large amount of interest in the older game within the Florida fighting game community. Orlando Business Journal reported that the event had over 4,000 attendees from 46 states and more than 25 countries. Besides major tournaments of new games such as Pokk√©n Tournament, King of Fighters XIV, and Guilty Gear Xrd, the event included a \\"free-to-play\\" video game arcade and a guest appearance of professional wrestlers Xavier Woods and Kenny Omega. =2017= Jebailey announced in July 2016 that CEO 2017 would move away from its traditional late-June date in order for the event to be held in a new venue. The event may even move to a different city. Later, CEO 2017 was announced to be held again in the Wyndham Resort in Orlando from June 16 to 18. The event featured tournaments for Street Fighter V, Tekken 7, Super Smash Bros Melee, Super Smash Bros for Wii U, Injustice 2, Pokken Tournament, Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3, Killer Instinct, The King of Fighters XIV, Guilty Gear Xrd, and BlazBlue: Central Fiction. Microsoft Studios announced at CEO 2017 that the 2013 version of Killer Instinct would be released on the Steam platform. Wrestling events In 2018, it was announced that New Japan Pro-Wrestling would host an event at the tournament, which was held Saturday night following the end of the day's matches. The event was named CEOxNJPW: When Worlds Collide. Jebailey made his wrestling debut at the event and defeated Michael Nakazawa. In 2019, new promotion All Elite Wrestling partnered with CEO to produce Fyter Fest. Jebailey once again wrestled Nakazawa, this time under hardcore stipulations, but failed to win the match. CEOtaku Jebailey set up a side event called CEOtaku in October 2015. A portmanteau of CEO and otaku, the event focused specifically on Japanese 2D fighting games often referred to as \\"anime fighters\\". Such games have historically not gotten as much attention among the fighting game community. Jebailey got the idea of starting CEOtaku when he noticed that Florida features many anime conventions throughout any given year, and was inspired when he saw a side-event at Evo 2015 dubbed \\"ANIMEvo\\". CEOtaku has since become an annual event as well. Dreamland In April 2017, Jebailey hosted CEO Dreamland, a Super Smash Bros.-focused event featuring tournaments for each game in the series. The event attracted nearly 1,100 attendees, but failed to return its production cost. Jebailey blamed the lack of attendees in comparison to his annual CEO events on poor scheduling, as Dreamland took place on Easter weekend and coincided with the annual Star Wars Celebration at Walt Disney World. Following its near $20,000 USD loss, Dreamland was originally thought to be unlikely to return, however on April 18, 2019, Jebailey confirmed that CEO Dreamland would return. The event is currently slated for a 2020 tournament held at the Wyndham Hotel in Orlando. DDR Storm Since 2016, CEO has also been the home of the Florida-based Dance Dance Revolution tournament, DDR STORM. Once a small side event to the larger fighting game tournaments, STORM has grown alongside the competitive DDR scene with each passing year, and is now regarded as one of the most prestigious DDR tournaments in the world. 2018's tournament was notable for having (at the time) the most entries for an in-person DDR tournament in history. STORM tournaments have also been held for related rhythm games Pump It Up and In the Groove.
