It is the oldest functioning theater in Utah as it was built in 1912. It also featured an underground tunnel which was used to smuggle alcohol during the American prohibition. The tunnel has been sealed recently during renovations, due to safety concerns. Description The theater is located at 78 South Main Street (US‚Äë89). The Beaux Arts building was constructed in 1912 and is currently undergoing renovations. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. History Gunnison entrepreneur Sims M. Duggins built the theater in 1912 as a \\"big box\\" as a first step in construction. Duggins had the Beaux-Arts School of Architectural Design in Paris design the fa√ßade and hired a Pittsburgh company to build it. Components of the fa√ßade arrived by train and were installed in 1915. Duggins died in 1928 and his widow hired C.E. Huish, whose family owned theaters throughout Utah, to manage the theater. Huish closed in the recessed entry with a wall at the front edge of the arch, and the addition that preserved many of the original decorations. Huish also installed restrooms and changed the name to the Star Theater. In 1940, the Cyrill E. Anderson family of Gunnison bought the theater and in the 1950s put up the triangular marquee that remained on the building until the current restoration began. The Andersons continued to operate the Star until 1973, although it became less profitable as the years passed as it faced competition from TV movies, videos and DVDs. After Cyrill E. Anderson's death in 1973, the family sold the theater to Max and Beth Curtis of Aurora, who in turn sold it to Ernie and Dawn Larson in 1981. The Larsens installed a new roof and began the nomination process for listing on the National Register of Historic places. In 1993, Paul Mower along with his son Mike Mower, owner of the Huish Theater in Payson and a descendant of one- time Star Theater manager C.E. Huish, purchased the Star. It was later incorporated into Hustar-Inc. The Mowers upgraded the seating and sound system, as well as reinforcing the wooden support system under the floor with concrete and steel. The Mowers sold the building in November 2004 to the Casino Star Theatre Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to restoring the rather dilapidated structure to its original splendor. Restoration of the exterior portion of the Theatre building was completed in late July 2013. Today In the late 1980s, before Larson sold the property to Mower, Diana Major Spencer and Lori Nay founded the non-profit organization Save Our Star (\\"SOS\\") and tried to purchase and rehabilitate the theater. When Mower put the theater on the market in 2004, Nay and Spencer formed the 501(c)(3) Casino Star Theatre Foundation to finance the building's purchase and repair.

He served as senator, minister, vice president, and acting president during these formative years. Early life Pac√≠fico Chiriboga was born in 1810, on the family estate in Riobamba, in what is now Chimborazo Province. He was the son of Don Martin Chiriboga y Leon, the last royalist corregidor of Riobamba. After the defeat of the Spanish forces, his father was exiled but died in the boat before they landed in Jamaica. His father's devotion to the crown did not affect the young Pac√≠fico's rise in the new Republic. The family land that had been confiscated during the revolution was restored and Pac√≠fico Chiriboga was involved early in the publication of the El Quite√±o Libre, a political periodical of great importance at the birth of the Ecuadorian nation. There, he worked with some of the most important intellectuals of his time, including Don Pedro Moncayo, Colonel Francisco Hall, Manuel de Asc√°subi y Matheu and his brother Roberto de Ascasubi. His restored fortune and group of friends led to a very prolific public life. Political career When President Juan Jose Flores left office in 1835, Pac√≠fico was elected to the Quito city council. He was then named Governor of Manabi and Pichincha in the 1840s. On August 30, 1852, he was elected Vice President with President Jos√© Mar√≠a Urvina, and was left in charge of the Executive branch for a total of 100 days in different periods between 1852 and 1854. Pac√≠fico was also vice-president from 1858 to 1860, and later was part of the triumvirate in power with Gabriel Garcia Moreno and Jer√≥nimo Carri√≥n, both early presidents. He was also part of a second triumvirate. He also served as Senator, Diputado (i.e. Congressman), Minister of State and Mayor of the city of San Francisco de Quito. As was the case with most politicians of the time, even when he was involved in government, he was involved in the maintenance and expansion of the family land holdings. He often used his own money to finance his political allies. At one point, he sent 4,000 heads of cattle to feed the troops of Dr. Garcia Moreno, during the wars between the Liberals and Conservatives. He also bought many properties within the city (Quito) limits, which he seems to have used for his political meetings.  Family  Don Pac√≠fico married and had ten children. He died in 1886 in his \\"main\\" Quito house after experiencing first- hand the birth of the new Republic.

The two schools in the system are the Catalyst Circle Rock Elementary School (Austin) and the Catalyst Maria Elementary School and High School (Chicago Lawn). History =The San Miguel Schools= The Catalyst Schools grew out of Chicago's San Miguel Schools, which were founded by Brother Ed Siderewicz and Gordon Hannon in 1995 when they met with a group of 18 students and a staff of four in a convent dining room in the Back of the Yards neighborhood. Today, the Back of the Yards campus serves mostly Hispanics; a second campus in Austin, which opened in 2002 but closed in 2012,http://austintalks.org/2012/03/san-miguel-chicagos-gary-comer-campus-to- close-at-end-of-school-year/ served mostly African-American students. Students at the San Miguel Schools saw increased academic success; in the San Miguel neighborhood, the average high-school graduation rate was 40% while more than 94% of students at San Miguel graduated from high school. San Miguel graduates also attended college at greater rates than those of their peers. =Planning for the Catalyst Schools= During their individual tenures in office, Chicago Public Schools CEOs Paul Vallas and Arne Duncan each asked the San Miguel Schools‚Äô Board of Directors to replicate the San Miguel Schools' academic model and values in the free-tuition charter school model. Some San Miguel Board members were initially apprehensive about the potentially negative public response to replicating a faith-based institution in the public charter context. Nevertheless, the Board investigated the possibility further and determined ways it could be done without undermining Church-State separation. When in June 2004 Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley launched Renaissance 2010, an initiative to increase the number of high quality educational options in communities across Chicago by 2010, the San Miguel Board of Directors had the impetus they needed to move forward. They incorporated the Catalyst Schools as a separate 501(c)(3) nonprofit educational institution in 2005. Also in 2005, Catalyst submitted a proposal to the Chicago Board of Education to establish the first Catalyst Charter School in the North Lawndale neighborhood. Located in the former Howland Elementary School, the new Catalyst Howland Charter school opened in Fall 2006 with 60 students in grades 4 and 5 and a mission \\"to provide quality elementary educational choice to urban students who have not been adequately served by existing educational institutions through the use of a curriculum and instruction that focuses on reading and math.\\" In later years, Catalyst Howland added additional grades with the capacity to serve as many as 540 students, or full enrollment (60 per grade) in grades K-8. After eleven years of service, however, Catalyst Howland closed voluntarily in July 2016.https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/proposal-to-move- charter-school-to-uptown-put-on-hold-by-school-board/ Also in 2005, a second proposal was submitted to the Chicago Public Schools Board of Education to establish Catalyst Circle Rock Elementary School. This new school, which replaced Circle Rock Elementary established by the Austin-based nonprofit agency Circle Urban Ministries, opened in fall 2007 initially as a Contract School under the Renaissance 2010 plan. The school started with approximately 60 students in grades 4 and 5, with plans to add grades 6, 7, and 8. In 2007, the proposal was amended and approved so that Catalyst Circle Rock could open with 250 students in grades K-8 and grow to 540 students in later years. The school's address changed to 5608 West Washington Boulevard but remained in Chicago's Austin neighborhood. In 2009, a proposal was submitted to the Chicago Public Schools Board of Education to convert the Catalyst Circle Rock Elementary School, which had been operating as a contract public school, into a charter school. The charter was approved, and Catalyst Circle Rock Charter Elementary school followed the mission of the first Catalyst Charter School: providing quality education through a focus on reading and math to urban students whose needs have not previously been met by other institutions. =Expansion to Chicago Lawn: Catalyst Maria Elementary and High Schools= The Need for Performing Schools in Chicago's Neighborhoods,https://www.iff.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cpsfullreport.pdf an October 2004 report by the Illinois Facilities Fund (IFF), named Chicago Lawn among the city's top 25 communities needing elementary and high schools. Complicating school choice in the Chicago Lawn neighborhood was the June 30, 2013, closing of Maria High School, a private all-girls high school operated by the Sisters of St. Casimir that had served the community for more than a century.https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/Maria-High-School-on-Southwest- Side-to-Close-131322094.html To fill the gap, Maria High School leaders invited the Catalyst Schools to propose a replication of its successful charter program in Chicago Lawn. The proposed school was also a response to a special interest by the Chicago Public Schools in implementing educational change and choice on the city's Southwest Side. Additionally, opening charter schools in high-need neighborhoods where parochial schools were closing had been an interest of Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel. A team of Catalyst Schools and Maria High School leaders therefore developed a multi-year strategy to offer the same quality education that Maria provided but tuition-free, coeducational, and with a K-8 division. In December 2011, Chicago Public Schools granted Catalyst a charter to open the Catalyst Maria Charter Elementary School and High School in the Maria High School building.http://www.beverlyreview.net/news/featured_news/article_ae7fd794-834f-5da6-ac1e-d0b878686cc5.html Catalyst Maria opened in four incremental phases: Fall 2012: K-5 and 9th grade; Fall 2013: Addition of 6th and 10th grades, and 50 students each in grades 11 and 12; Fall 2014: Addition of 7th grade and completion of full enrollment in grades 11 and 12; Fall 2015: Full enrollment, K-12 (1,100 students: 540 in K-8 and 560 in 9-12). In 2012, Catalyst purchased the eight- acre Maria campus from the Sisters of St. Casimir. This included the 198,000 square-foot school building at the corner of Marquette Road and California Avenue. Through fundraising efforts, Catalyst invested $1.8 million in capital improvements to the facility, including technology, furniture and equipment for the elementary school, and everything needed to ensure the physical plant met ADA and building code requirements. The investment, made possible through private philanthropy, provided a Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) curriculum to begin in kindergarten and continue through twelfth grade. Educational approach The Catalyst Schools offer a college-preparatory educational experience. Since many students arrive with below-average math and reading skills, teachers focus on math, reading, and language arts every day for 80 minutes each. Because this adds up to 1,200 minutes of core instruction per week, the school days are longer than those at traditional schools to leave time for gym, cultural enrichment, and other activities. At the Catalyst Schools, the school week is 2,100 minutes, whereas the typical week at a Chicago Public Schools school is 1,500 minutes. The schools also work to make sure that students and their parents are prepared for the transition to high school by equipping them with practical life skills and helping them complete high school applications. After graduating from eighth grade at the Catalyst Schools, students are tracked for four years by the schools to assure that they have assistance in seeking employment or searching for a college as well. The Catalyst Schools teach values in addition to core subjects like reading and math. For example, the students are met at the front door each school day by a teacher or administrator who shakes their hands and gives a word of encouragement. Positive relationship is one way in which Catalyst blends public, private, and faith-based education models. Others include: A Culture of Peace and Calm ‚Äì Mutual respect and trust translates to an environment in which scholars feel safe and learn without unnecessary anxiety. Higher Order Thinking and Problem Solving - the inquiry method is especially important in math and science instruction. Renaissance Fine Arts - During weekly Renaissance Enrichment classes, leading arts nonprofits introduce scholars to the arts through music, dance, and other creative pursuits. In partnership with Chicago's Ravinia Festival, the Sistema Ravinia symphonic orchestra at Circle Rock is the largest African-American elementary school orchestra in the nation.https://www.ravinia.org/Page/RTP_Play Social-Emotional Learning - Social workers and special education teams on the Circle Rock staff help scholars overcome the emotional barriers preventing them from classroom success. By untangling their frustrations, anxieties, and confusions, the staff enable scholars to concentrate on learning. Service Learning - Scholars participate in age appropriate service learning programs that help them understand the importance of a positive and productive relationship with the community. The graduation ceremonies celebrate achievement, unity, and a symbolic passing of the torch. Before the ceremony, teachers present neckties to eighth-grade students both as a symbol of maturation and to complete their high school uniforms. Later in the ceremony, eighth-grade students bestow ties on their seventh-grade colleagues to symbolize that it is the next class's turn to lead. =Achievements and Honors= The goal is for every Catalyst scholar to graduate from high school on time and enter college, or a meaningful trade, five years after eighth grade graduation. As of Fall 2018, 87% of all Catalyst Circle Rock alumni of high school age and older have graduated from high school within four years. Additionally, of the Circle Rock Classes of 2008 and 2009 (post-college-age alumni), 41% have completed college, 26% are still in college, 20% are working with some college experience, and 13% are working with no college experience. At Catalyst Maria High School, 100% of the Class of 2017 were accepted to college, receiving 829 acceptance letters and $15.3 million in scholarship offers. Seventy-nine Maria graduates received full-tuition college scholarships. In spring 2015, the Chicago Board of Education awarded Catalyst Circle Rock a full five-year (2015-2020) renewal of its charter without conditions, and in spring 2017, it awarded a full five-year charter renewal without conditions to Catalyst Maria (2017-2022). Catalyst Maria High School also received AdvancED accreditation, meaning the school is performing at or above expectations in five main standards defining excellent schools. CPS awarded Catalyst Circle Rock a Level 1 rating and Catalyst Maria a Level 1+ rating‚Äîthe two highest ratings CPS gives schools in its network. The University of Chicago's ‚ÄúMy School, My Voice‚Äù 2017 survey ranked the Catalyst Schools network Well Organized, its highest rating possible. =The Kehrein Center for the Arts= Catalyst is currently in the process of developing a new performing arts venue for the Austin neighborhood by restoring a mid-twentieth-century auditorium in its Circle Rock school building at Central Avenue and Washington Boulevard. Designed in 1954 for the Archdiocese of Chicago by Belli & Belli Architects and serving for twenty years as the main performing arts space for Siena High School, the auditorium evokes the neo-futuristic designs of Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen. It is a sculpture of masonry and poured-in-place concrete with curving walls and three-dimensional spaces that interlock with a library and exterior courtyard. It is anticipated that the $4 million project will be open to the public in early 2019. When completed, the Kehrein Center for the Arts, named in memory of community leader Glen Kehrein, will provide Austin and the West Side with a performance space that features a 1,000-seat auditorium for performing arts, cinema, and special events; and a gallery for the exhibition of local art. The Kehrein Center is slated to be one of the area's largest and most versatile performing arts and public community centers.

It was built between 1658 and 1678 by Kaspar Stockalper, a silk merchant of Brig. The Stockalper Palace was the largest private construction in Switzerland at the time. It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance. History The first building on the site is known as the Stockalper House, which was built in 1532 by Peter Stockalper. Over the following century it was expanded toward the north, but it remained generally unchanged until the rise of Kaspar Stockalper. Kaspar Stockalper was born to a wealthy family in Brig on 14 July 1609. After studying at the university in Freiburg im Breisgau from 1627 to 1629, he returned to Brig and began building an extensive trading empire. By 1647 he had the local salt monopoly and built a road over the Simplon pass which gave him a monopoly on trade over this pass. Between 1651-59 he built a canal from Vouvry to Collombey which expanded his trading empire. At the peak of his power, Kaspar employed around 5,000 people (at that time Brig only had about 900 residents).Swiss castles.ch accessed 11 August 2016 Between 1630 and 1640 Kaspar expanded the Stockalper House toward the south with a great hall, chapel and other construction. The great hall was decorated with a coat of arms in 1653. The chapel altar is black with silver reliefs depicting the Adoration of the Magi and the Coronation of the Virgin, both of which were the work of Samuel Hornung of Augsburg in 1655. A two-story covered arcade leads from the Stockalper House to the much larger Palace.Federal Office for Civil Protection quoting GSK: Kunstf√ºhrer durch die Schweiz. Bern accessed 16 August 2016 Kaspar's extensive trade empire required an extensive warehouse and in 1658 he began construction on the Palace to provide that space. Construction of the long building lasted 20 years. Once it was completed, Kaspar did not get many opportunities to enjoy his monumental building. In 1679 the communities of Visp, Leuk, Sierre and Sion rose up against him and drove him into exile in Domodossola. Six years later, in 1685, the Diet of Valais negotiated an agreement that allowed Kaspar to return and live out his last years in his Palace.Municipal website accessed 11 August 2016 In 1948 the city took over the Palace and in 1960 the city council moved in. A museum was established in the Palace and some of the rooms were renovated and used for concerts and exhibitions. Since 2010 the courtyard and surrounding parks have been included in Google Street View.Direktlink Today, there are guided tours which allow visitors to tour many parts of the building.Tour information for the Palace Castle site The Palace was built next to the smaller 16th century Gothic Stockalper House. It is a rectangular building with three towers on the north-west, south-west and south-east corners. The interior features a large, rectangular courtyard () with arcades in the style of the Italian Renaissance. The balusters that line the second story are not original, but were added later. The three towers were named for the Three kings or Wise Men of the Bible. The tallest was named after Saint Caspar as well as Kaspar Stockalper. The other two were then named Melchior and Balthazar, the traditional names of the Wise Men.

It is a member of the Varanus prasinus species group.Monitor-lizards.net This monitor lizard is found in a restricted area of less than 100 km2 near the Claudie and Nesbit rivers, in the McIlwraith and Iron Ranges of the Cape York Peninsula in northern Queensland. Description The colouration of V. keithhornei is dark black on the upper side. It has moderately big and smooth head scales. Its tail has no visible keel. The canopy goanna is small for a monitor lizard, reaching a total length up to 77 cm, but more robust than other species of the V. prasinus species complex, and can be further distinguished from them by its colour and the conical throat scales. Specimens were originally assigned to the species Varanus prasinus by Czechura in 1980, but Wells and Wellington declared it a new species 5 years later.  Diet  They forage in the trees and the leaf litter for insects such as orthopterans, roaches, and beetles. References Further reading * Photos of Varanus keithhornei at Pbase.com * Anonymous 2001.

It originally aired in the United States on Fox on April 25, 2010. The episode follows Stan who is unhappy with Steve's passive behavior, so he poses as a bully for Steve to toughen him up, despite Francine's disapproval. The episode was written by Matt Fusfeld and Alex Cuthbertson and directed by Rodney Clouden. \\"Bully for Steve\\" was watched by 5.31 million viewers in its original airing. The episode received positive reviews with its main plot, along with mixed reviews with its subplot, from critics. The episode features guest performances of Jeff Fischer, Kevin Michael Richardson, Cleo King, and Erik Durbin. Plot Stan learns that Steve is too passive and resorts to confronting Steve as a bully. Steve quickly figures out the bully is his own dad. After a physical confrontation, Steve comes home injured and Stan asks him what happened and changes the topic to his own high school experience being bullied by a Greek person named Stelio Kontos. He also tells Steve that, as bullies do not just go away, he must deal with them. Francine opposes this approach, saying that violence is never the answer, so Stan threatens to beat Steve up further if he ever tells her he is being bullied by his dad. Francine notifies Principal Lewis of her increasing concern for Steve, and despite Stan's threats to keep Steve from telling, Lewis reviews the security camera. Francine finds out that Stan is the bully. Nervous, Stan flees from the school, with Francine chasing him, eventually crashing her car into his SUV as he tries to escape from her wrath. Enraged at Stan's actions, Francine tries to train Steve to fight back, but is unsuccessful, and Steve is unable to dodge Stan with an old lady disguise. Finally accepting that he cannot avoid being bullied, Steve decides to settle things at the school playground the next day at 3:00. However, instead of fighting himself, Steve hires Stelio Kontos to beat Stan up. Stelio mercilessly beats Stan, leaving him bloodied and bruised to the point where he finally admits defeat. After the fight, Stan is considerably injured and humiliated, but respectfully acknowledges Steve for overcoming his bully in his own way. Meanwhile, Reginald asks Hayley out on a date, which she agrees. They arrive at the carnival and encounter Jeff Fischer, who is working there. After engaging in a brief conversation with each other, Hayley and Jeff reconnect, with Reginald understanding. In another subplot, Roger attempts a career as a crime scene photographer, and finally achieves success with a picture of Stan's injuries from the fight. Production The episode was written by series regulars Matt Fusfeld and Alex Cuthbertson and was directed by series regular Rodney Clouden. It's the second episode Clouden, Fusfeld, and Cuthbertson worked on this season, their previous episode being \\"Don't Look a Smith Horse in the Mouth.\\" Ron Hughart and Brent Woods served as supervising directors for \\"Bully for Steve.\\" Erik Sommers served as the main producer for the episode, with Laura McCreary and Erik Durbin serving as co- producers, along with Chris McKenna and Matt McKenna as supervising producers. Walter Murphy, a regular music composer for the music of MacFarlane-produced shows, including the opening theme songs of American Dad! and The Cleveland Show, composed the music for the episode. In addition to the regular cast, actress Cleo King guest starred in the episode. Recurring voice actors Jeff Fischer and Kevin Michael Richardson, and co-producer Erik Durbin also guest starred in the episode. Cultural references A recurring gag throughout the episode is Stan insulting Steve with a sexual joke involving the usage of the phrase, \\"That's what your mom said last night,\\" a variation of the original phrase, \\"That's what she said.\\" When Stan is driving in his SUV right after fleeing the high school, he sings a soundtrack of Drops of Jupiter by the musical group Train. Francine directly mentions the marine theme park SeaWorld when she says she needs to \\"punch a dolphin,\\" while Steve mentions the social networking site Facebook, where he says he found Stelio Kontos. Towards the end of the episode, Cap'n Crunch appears at the police station when he decides to give Roger the job for presenting the injured Stan, demonstrating Roger's talents in crime scene photography. Reception \\"Bully for Steve\\" was broadcast on April 25, 2010, as a part of an animated television night on Fox, and was preceded by The Simpsons, The Cleveland Show, and Family Guy. It was watched by 5.31 million viewers, according to Nielsen ratings. The episode also acquired a 2.7/7 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, beating The Cleveland Show but scoring below The Simpsons and Family Guy. The episode's ratings increased slightly from the show's last episode, \\"Merlot Down Dirty Shame,\\" and its total viewership increased by 2.65%. The episode's main plot was met with positive reception by television critics and fans alike upon its initial release, while its subplot received mixed reception. The Los Angeles Times Show Tracker blog gave a positive review to the episode. They comment its main plot, Stan teaching Steve a lesson, as \\"the next best thing to Roger‚Äôs insanity.\\" Jason Hughes of TV Squad also praised the episode overall, commenting that the main plot of Stan bullying Steve \\"was a stroke of genius by the creators of 'American Dad.'\\" Hughes said it \\"fits in perfectly with [Steve's] character.\\" He added \\"it led to so many other funny moments in the episode,\\" noting both instances of the janitor's sudden werewolf transformation at school and the footage showing Principal Lewis \\"drinking an entire case of beer and peeing on the basketball hoop before heading off.\\" However, he gave a mixed review to the episode's subplot involving the relationship between Hayley and Reginald, saying he could not \\"bring [him]self to really care about this relationship, or even Reginald at all.\\" In a simultaneous review of the episode of The Simpsons that preceded the show, Todd VanDerWuff of The A.V. Club gave \\"Bully for Steve\\" a positive review, saying that the episode overall was \\"just purely funny.\\" He praised Stan for \\"missing more and more work for this ridiculous quest to make Steve a better man,\\" as well as Stelio Kontos for his own theme song and his fight scene with Stan. Overall, VanDerWuff said that the episode's main plot worked, suggesting that the relationship between Stan and Steve, their \\"mutual lack of understanding,\\" is analogous to that between Homer and Lisa in The Simpsons. However, like Hughes of TV Squad, VanDerWuff criticized the episode's secondary plot, commenting Hayley and Reginald's relationship, \\"which seems to have reached its ending [...], continues to just not work, [...] since the ending to the storyline was fairly abrupt and out of nowhere.\\" He rated the episode an A-, the highest grade of the night, scoring higher than The Simpsons episode \\"The Squirt and the Whale.\\" References External links Category:2010 American television episodes Category:American Dad!

A thermal generating station, the Point Aconi Generating Station is owned and operated by Nova Scotia Power Corporation. It opened on August 13, 1994 following four years of construction. The Point Aconi Generating Station is situated on the shores of the Cabot Strait at the northeastern tip of Boularderie Island, located approximately west of the headland named Point Aconi and east of the headland named Table Head. Its civic address is 1800 Prince Mine Rd, Point Aconi, NS. The facility is located at the northern terminus of Prince Mine Rd - Highway 162. Unlike the nearby Lingan Generating Station which has four generating units, Point Aconi has only one. The Point Aconi unit, however, is the largest producing unit in Nova Scotia and is also the province‚Äôs newest. The facility is able to produce 165 MW and, unlike the vast majority of Canadian coal-fired power plants, uses Circulating Fluidized Bed (CFB) to reduce emissions of NOx and SO2. Point Aconi was the world‚Äôs largest CFB plant‚Äîand the first to enter commercial service in North America‚Äîwhen it came on-line in 1993. Tokyo-based Mitsui & Co., Ltd. was the turnkey contractor for Point Aconi; Sargent & Lundy was the project‚Äôs architect/engineer. Operation The Point Aconi Generating Station has one 165 MW unit (name plate capacity 186 MW). Its boiler was supplied by Finland‚Äôs Ahlstrom Pyropower. The plant burns bituminous coal and petroleum coke in a variety of blends, which is transported to the facility using semi-trailer trucks from a bulk ship unloading pier in Sydney Harbour near the community of Whitney Pier. The unit is a fluidized bed combustor built for NOx and SO2, control. The station has a fabric filter baghouse for particulate control. Point Aconi station is the only Nova Scotia Power Thermal plant without activated carbon injection system to control mercury emissions as it is an inherently lower emitter due to the injection of limestone into the process. Fly ash and bottom ash is handled dry and land-filled. The unit has one chimney above ground. The drum-type reheat CFB boiler was designed to produce 1,207,150 lb/hr of steam (maximum continuous rating) at 1,800 psi and 1,000 F. Toshiba Corp. supplied the multicylinder, tandem-compound steam turbine-generator. The 3,600-rpm generator is totally enclosed and has a cylindrical rotor whose winding is directly cooled by hydrogen at 30 psi. The generator is rated at 217 MVA and has a power factor of 0.85. Point Aconi‚Äôs coal-handling system comprises an active 27,500-ton storage pile; an inactive storage pile of identical size; receiving hoppers, conveyors, crushing equipment; and four in-plant storage bunkers. The conveying system can handle 440 tons of coal per hour or about 550,000 tons per year. The limestone- handling system consists of receiving hoppers and conveyors common to the coal system, crushers, dryers, storage silos, and a pneumatic conveyor leading to two in-plant storage bunkers. Limestone also arrives by truck, at the rate of about 165,000 tons per year. The in-plant ash-handling system conveys fly ash from hoppers under the baghouse, economizer, and air heater, as well as bottom ash from the combustor, to either of two silos located outside the powerhouse. Once in the silos, the ash is conditioned with water, loaded into trucks, and transported to a disposal site located next to the plant. Point Aconi uses a once-through circulating seawater system. Seawater is drawn from offshore at a depth of through a velocity cap intake structure. A tunnel below the seabed connects the offshore velocity cap to the onshore pump house. The two-pass, surface-type deaerating condenser operates at 1 inch HgA. The Point Aconi Generating Station consumes 189,000 tonnes of coal and 213,000 tonnes of petroleum coke per year and currently generates approximately 6.8% of the province's electricity and produces roughly 10.07% of the province's air pollution, including hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, hexachlorobenzene and mercury.\\"Dirty Air from Power Plants Fuels Health Problems in Nova Scotia\\" Pollution Watch In 2007, it created 1.465 million tonnes of greenhouse gases.Facility and Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Environment Canada In 2017 it reported 1,188,377 tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent under Nova Scotia's Cap- and Trade regulations. History The Seaboard Generating Station opened in Glace Bay in 1931 by Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation and was the sole supplier of electricity for the Industrial Cape Breton region until its purchase by Nova Scotia Power in 1966 as part of DOSCO's ongoing asset liquidation. Nova Scotia Power opened the province's largest generating station, the Lingan Generating Station, at the height of the 1979 energy crisis to take advantage of relatively cheap Cape Breton coal being produced by the Cape Breton Development Corporation (DEVCO). The idea of replacing the aging Seaboard Generating Station was discussed during the 1980s and was an important promise by the incumbent Progressive Conservative Party led by Premier John Buchanan during the 1988 provincial election. After Buchanan's government was returned to power, Nova Scotia Power issued a call for proposals in October 1988 to construct a 150 megawatt CFB (Circulating Fluidized Bed) coal-fired electrical generating station in Point Aconi. Significant controversy dogged Buchanan's election promise to build a new generating station as the Public Utility Board had authority to decide on all applications by Nova Scotia Power to construct new generating stations as well as associated rate increases. The PUB began to conduct hearings into the project in spring 1989 and stated that an economic analysis of Buchanan's election promise (the $500 million Point Aconi Generating Station) was not required as the province's generating needs were met by current sources. Coincidentally, Nova Scotia Power had also promised to purchase 30 megawatts annually from small independent power producers in the province beginning in 1990, however this agreement was abolished after the Small Private Power Association of Nova Scotia intervened at the PUB hearings to block the proposed Point Aconi Generating Station. On April 27, 1989, Buchanan introduced a controversial amendment to the Public Utilities Act, which would remove the requirement for Nova Scotia Power to submit proposals for new generating station to the PUB. Hearings into the Point Aconi project were cancelled after the amendment to the Public Utilities Act receiving Royal Assent in early June 1989.\\"Buchanan short-circuits N.S. utilities board with power plant bill.\\" The Globe and Mail, Thursday, April 27, 1989 = Request for Proposals = In early January 1990, Nova Scotia Power announced that the Japanese industrial conglomerate Mitsui had won the Request for Proposals (RFP) that had been issued in fall 1988 and a contract was signed on behalf of the Government of Nova Scotia. The proposal detailed a turnkey project designed by Mitsui with the CFB steam boiler supplied by Pyro-Power through Kamtech Services (a subsidiary of Lauren Engineers & Constructors of Abilene, Texas), project management and engineering by Chicago-based Sargent & Lundy LLC, and construction of the plant itself by Jones Power Corporation. = Public hearings = Two weeks later, the provincial government announced that its Environmental Control Council would conduct a one-day hearing into the project on January 18, 1990 in place of the PUB hearings conducted the previous spring which were aborted as a result of the amendment to the Public Utilities Act. The hearing received submissions from citizens and organizations that were strongly opposed to the Point Aconi Generating Station, pointing out the environmental impact, that its generating capacity wasn't required, and that it was a political mega-project that would add to the financial debt of the publicly owned Nova Scotia Power Corporation. Other submissions from citizens and organizations were supportive of the project, which they claimed would create an estimated 500 construction and operating jobs, as well as theoretically guarantee work in Cape Breton's coal mines; the United Mine Workers of America Local 26 had lobbied hard for the power plant. Richie Mann, the environment critic for the official opposition Liberal Party asked at the one-day hearing, \\"Can you give us some evidence that this process is not an exercise in public relations, a sham?\\"Kevin Cox \\"Panel asked to show evidence power plant hearing not 'sham'.\\" The Globe and Mail, Friday, January 19, 1990 On Friday, March 9, 1990 the provincial government announced its approval of the estimated $436 million project, even though it had already signed a contract with Mitsui two months earlier. Nova Scotia's Environment Minister John Leefe defended the projected 1.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions, stating \\"[The project will be] absolutely inconsequential in terms of global carbon dioxide production.\\"Kevin Cox \\"Nova Scotia to construct a coal-fired power plant\\" The Globe and Mail Saturday, March 10, 1990 Nova Scotia Power pointed out the environmental benefits of the Point Aconi project, stating that the use of CFB technology whereby limestone would be used to filter out sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) which were major contributors to acid rain. Minister Leefe stated that Nova Scotia Power intended to reduce SO2 emissions from its generating stations to 100,000 tonnes a year by 2010 from the 1990 level of 160,000 tonnes. Minister Leefe also noted that while the use of CFB technology would reduce acid rain, it would also result in a comparatively massive increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions which was a greenhouse gas; Leefe told reporters that Nova Scotia's coal-fired plants contributed 32 per cent of the 18 million tonnes per year of CO2 emitted by the province (as of 1990). The projected increase in Nova Scotia's CO2 emissions as a result of the Point Aconi Generating Station (an estimated additional 1.5 million tonnes per year) went against a recent (1990) decision by federal and provincial energy ministers to reduce emissions of the gas by at least 20 per cent by 2005.Kevin Cox \\"Nova Scotia to construct a coal-fired power plant\\" The Globe and Mail Saturday, March 10, 1990 The debate over construction of the Point Aconi Generating Station took place in the shadow of a much larger global debate over acid rain and its contributing factors, such as fossil fueled generating stations. The acid rain controversy resulted in the Canada-United States Air Quality Agreement which was signed by both countries on March 13, 1991 and stipulated that both countries would agree to reduce emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx). Canada-United States Clean Air Agreement - Environment Canada = Full Federal Environmental Review rejected = On September 20, 1990, federal Minister of Fisheries and Oceans Bernard Valcourt rejected a full environmental review of the project, arguing that any problems to the environment would be relatively minor. Valcourt justified this decision by referring to a scientific report on the project conducted by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans which stated that use of CFB technology could be mitigated. It noted, however, the widespread concern of local residents over the effect of the generating station's draw on ground water supplies (CFB requires large amounts of fresh water) as well as ash discharge and CO2 emissions. The DFO scientists noted widespread mistrust of the provincial government's decision and that the controversial one-day hearing in January left the impression \\"of a cooked-up deal between the province and federal government to slip this project by without a fair assessment of its potential dangers. In fact, problems are relatively minor... Point Aconi is in some respects a model.\\"Kevin Cox \\"Ottawa rejects full review of power station's effects.\\" The Globe and Mail Friday, September 21, 1990 On December 13, 1990, lawyers for Greenpeace, the Ecology Action Centre and six property owners who live near Point Aconi argued in the Federal Court of Canada that Valcourt had made a legal error in rejecting a public environmental review panel and that federal Environmental Assessment Review Panel guidelines should be followed to institute a formal review of the $436 million project. Mr. Justice Andrew MacKay ruled against the application on Friday, January 18, 1991 by stating that the Department of Fisheries and Oceans acted in accordance with the law in deciding not to order a full environmental assessment of the project. MacKay noted that the project has resulted in substantial testing of ground water around the plant. He also noted that because there are no standards for CO2, it was impossible to say that the plant would create a pollution problem with its massive CO2 emissions.Special to the Globe and Mail \\"Lawyer contends minister erred in coal plant ruling\\" The Globe and Mail Friday, December 13, 1990 A citizens liaison committee was established by Nova Scotia Power to review the project. Current (2010) Member of Parliament for Sydney‚ÄîVictoria, Mark Eyking whose family operated several farms on Boularderie Island near Point Aconi was a member of this committee at that time and had questions about how emissions from the plant or ground water withdrawn for it would affect his crops or how losses would be compensated, stating, \\"We see all these little mistakes happening and we know we're going to get dumped on. But when we ask for a neutral party to look at this, Nova Scotia power brings in its big shooters and they knock us down like pegs. Now it's almost too late but people won't sit down and take this any more.\\"Kevin Cox \\"Power but no glory in Point Aconi\\" The Globe and Mail Saturday, March 16, 1991 In addition to the estimated $436 million cost for the generating station, the project also included construction of a $150 million transmission line running for from Point Aconi to Halifax. Several property owners along the proposed route rejected offers by Nova Scotia Power to purchase their land, citing the physiological effects of the electromagnetic field from transmission lines. Additional controversy occurred when it was determined that the proposed route would disturb a great blue heron colony, which brought angry responses from members of the Mi'kmaq Nation.Kevin Cox \\"Power plant ruffles more than feathers\\" The Globe and Mail Saturday, July 6, 1991 Mitsui formed Mitsui & Co. (Point Aconi) Ltd. as an extraprovincial corporation in another province on December 1, 1989 as a result of its RFP submission. Mitsui & Co. (Point Aconi) Ltd. was registered in Nova Scotia on February 12, 1990 after the contract was signed with Nova Scotia Power in early January. 450px Construction Construction of the Point Aconi Generating Station began in early 1990 after Mitsui & Co. (Point Aconi) Ltd. contracted with Jones Power Corporation to act as construction manager and carry out construction work for the Point Aconi Generating Station project. Jones Power Corporation's obligations were guaranteed by its subsidiary J.A. Jones Construction.https://rjsc.gov.ns.ca Nova Scotia Registry of Joint Stock The Point Aconi Generating Station project ran into delays as a result of cost overruns, resulting in a series of prolonged contractual disputes that arose between 1991 and 1992. Jones Power Corporation claimed millions of dollars in additional compensation and a July 28, 1992 memorandum of understanding between Mitsui & Co. (Point Aconi) Ltd. and Jones Power Co. fixed compensation for Jones Power Corporation at $118 million. The companies agreed to complete the project on November 5, 1992 and leave the contractual dispute after the project's conclusion. Additional documents were discovered after the MOU had been signed but were deemed to be protected by solicitor- client privilege or litigation privilege as detailed in Mitsui & Co. (Point Aconi) Ltd. v. Jones Power Co. which is referenced as [2000] NSJ no. 258; 2000 NSCA 96; Mitsui & Co.

The Civil Litigation Process: Cases and Materials, Sixth Edition. Toronto: Emond Montgomery Publications Limited , pg. 826 Construction of the plant was overshadowed by the resignation of Premier John Buchanan upon his appointment to the Senate of Canada in the wake of a corruption scandal relating to his tenure as premier. The selection of a new leader for the governing Progressive Conservative Party, Donald Cameron, took place on February 26, 1991. Cameron made a surprise announcement on January 9, 1992 that his government would privatize Nova Scotia Power Corporation to remove public responsibility for the utility's $2.4 billion debt; Cameron stated that the debt had hurt the province's credit rating and that there had been allegations of political interference for setting electricity rates and decisions to build large power projects.Kevin Cox \\"N.S. to sell off electrical utility: Premier sets June stock sale.\\" The Globe and Mail, Friday, January 10, 1992 The $850 million initial public offering for 85 million shares of the utility took place on August 12, 1992.Dennis Slocum \\"N.S.

The Ahlstrom Pyropower circulating fluidized-bed (CFB) combustion system was designed to achieve a 90% reduction in SO2 emissions and a 65% to 75% reduction in NOx emissions‚Äîvery respectable numbers in 1994, when the plant began operation. After initial production issues at the Point Aconi facility were resolved, Nova Scotia Power Corporation closed and decommissioned the 65-year-old Seaboard Generating Station in 1997.\\"Seaboard Power Corporation\\" taken from History of Electric Power Companies in Nova Scotia Prince Colliery coal The Point Aconi Generating Station was originally designed to burn high sulphur coal mined in the Sydney Coal Field, which it sits atop. The primary source of coal was to be from the Prince Colliery, located east of the generating station property. The Prince Colliery was owned by the federal Crown corporation Cape Breton Development Corporation (DEVCO) which was beset with production problems at its three remaining collieries during the mid-late 1990s as a result of flooding, roof collapses and labour difficulties.

That required coal ordered for the Point Aconi Generating Station and Lingan Generating Station to be transported by the Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotia Railway to the DEVCO coal washing plant at Victoria Junction, and the coal destined for the Point Aconi Generating Station was trucked the final distance to the plant. DEVCO closed the Prince Colliery, its last operating coal mine, on November 23, 2001; ironically, the original reason for constructing the Point Aconi Generating Station had been to secure the long- term viability of the Prince Colliery.\\"Pennsylvania Coal Unloaded at Sydney,\\" Cape Breton Post October 23, 1998, taken from History of Nova Scotia with special attention given to Communications and Transportation, Chapter 40, September-October 1998 After Nova Scotia Power purchased the surface assets of DEVCO in late 2001, all coal for its two remaining thermal generating stations in Industrial Cape Breton was imported through the International Coal Pier on Sydney Harbour which was formerly owned and operated for coal export by DEVCO.http://www.littletechshoppe.com/ns1625/nshist50.html \\"NSPI Fuel Supplies at Dangerously Low Levels\\" Nova Scotia Power (http://www.nspower.ca/AboutUs/WhatsNew/detail1568.html)  See also  *List of power stations in Canada References Category:Buildings and structures in the Cape Breton Regional Municipality Category:Coal-fired power stations in Nova Scotia Category:Nova Scotia Power ","title":"Point Aconi Generating Station"},{"id":"27116818","text":"The Antiguo Cuartel Militar Espa√±ol de Ponce or \\"El Castillo\\" (English: Old Spanish Military Headquarters in Ponce or \\"The Castle\\") is the only structure directly related to the events of the land defense of Puerto Rico during the 1898 American invasion of the Island.Mariano G.

History \\"El Castillo\\", as this building is commonly known, was built in 1894 by the Spanish Royal Corps of Engineers as general headquarters for the Spanish military garrison stationed in Ponce. Since 1898, when Puerto Rico became a possession of the United States, this structure has served various purposes, first as courthouse and later as district jailhouse.

In the late 1980s, it ceased to be used as a district jail, was reconditioned, and in 1992 it was inaugurated as the headquarters of the Ponce School of Fine Arts, which is its role. The building was designed by the Spanish Royal Corps of Engineers. The architecture consists of 19th Century Civil Architecture. It is one of the largest Neoclassic Isabelino civil architecture structures built in Ponce during the 19th century. Its sober exterior walls help express its intended original use. The building played a significant role in law enforcement during the last years of the Spanish colonial rule for southern Puerto Rico and has played a significant role for both law enforcement and judicial purposes since then. Quinto in Ponce, Puerto Rico, the new tenant at \\"El Castillo\\". Significance The Spanish garrison stationed in Ponce at the time of the arrival of the American troops in 1898 played a significant role in the defense of the island. While the Spanish commander in charge of the Ponce garrison had determined it was not possible to defend the city of Ponce from the American advance at the time, the Ponce troops, together with the aid of other smaller garrisons, held the Asomante area preventing the U.S. Army from invading Aibonito in their advance to the conquest of fortified areas of San Juan. The Ponce garrison also helped the Guayama garrison in its attempt to detain American troops from taking that city. \\"This is the only structure directly related to these [land] events that has been identified to date\\". Description The building consists of a two level square structure with an interior courtyard. It is built in brick and stone masonry; timber beams and brick layers were used for the roof and floors. The interior courtyard is surrounded by open-arched galleries in both levels. During the time when the building was being used as a district jail in 1987, the galleries provided the foundation of the jail barracks. A repetition of windows over the facade's plane without any ornament gives the building an austere appearance, typical of military architecture developed during the Spanish period in Puerto Rico. The building still preserves its original lead gutters in the form of cannons. The building has been altered little since its original construction. The most significant alteration has been the replacement of the original wooden louvers windows with metal louvered windows. Also, iron bars have been added to its interior openings. The building has also been upgraded in two rather minimal ways: the interior courtyard was repaved and modern sanitary facilities were installed.

In Hindu mythology, Keshi (; ', nominative singular masculine from the root , literally \\"long haired\\") is the horse- demon, killed by Krishna, an avatar of the god Vishnu. The demon was dispatched by Krishna's evil uncle Kamsa, who was destined to die at Krishna's hands. The tale of the slaying of Keshi is told in the Hindu scriptures of Bhagavata Purana, Vishnu Purana and Harivamsa. Krishna is often praised as Keshava - the slayer of Keshi - in scriptures. Legend Keshi's legend is recounted in the tenth Book of the Bhagavata Purana (between 500 CE - 1000 CE). Kamsa, the evil king of Mathura and the maternal uncle of Krishna, is destined to be killed by Krishna. In an attempt to avoid his death, Kamsa sends a series of demons to Gokula, where Krishna is staying with his foster- parents. After Krishna kills the bull demon Arishta, the divine sage Narada confirms to Kamsa that Krishna is his sister Devaki's child and that the girl- child that Kamsa had killed, mistaking her for the child of Devaki, was in fact the daughter of Yashoda, Krishna's foster-mother. Infuriated at hearing this, Kamsa calls the demon Keshi and orders him to kill Krishna and his brother Balarama.Bryant p. 151 Chapter 35 19-23 alt=Painting showing a blue coloured man fighting a white horse. Keshi assumes the form of a huge horse, who gallops at the speed of thoughts, wears the earth with his hooves and scatters celestial vehicles and clouds in the sky with his mane. His neighing terrifies the people. Krishna challenges Keshi to a duel, as the horse is creating havoc around Gokula. Keshi roars like a lion and charges towards Krishna, striking him with his hooves. Krishna catches hold of Keshi's two legs and tosses him to a great distance. Recovering from the fall, the agitated Keshi opens his mouth and attacks Krishna. As soon as Krishna thrusts his left arm into Keshi's mouth, all of Keshi's teeth fall. Krishna's arm expands, and Keshi chokes to death, as sweat flows from his body, his eyes roll and he struggles kicking his feet. As Keshi falls lifeless on the ground, assuming his true demon form, the gods and Narada extol Krishna. Narada in his panegyric thanks Krishna for easily slaying the horse-demon, whose neighing alone was driving the gods to abandon heaven. He further prophesies the great deeds that Krishna will perform later, including the killing of Kamsa.Bryant pp. 153-4 Chapter 36 1-25 The fourth Book of the Vishnu Purana (between the 1st century BCE to the 4th century CE) also tells the story. However, Keshi first appears in the episode when Kamsa calls the host of demons to kill all male children, once he realizes Krishna is born.Wilson p. 272 Chapters 15 and 16 of the fourth Book presents a detailed account of Keshi's death which parallels the Bhagavata Purana account. The narrative of Arishta's death, Narada's disclosure to Kamsa and the subsequent ordering of Keshi is the same.Wilson pp. 335-8 Chapter 15 Though the terror by Keshi on earth and sky and Krishna's challenge is the same, the fight starts directly with Keshi attacking Krishna with his opened mouth. The hand of Krishna choking Keshi at the same time, tearing his body into two halves. The splitting of Keshi's body is not told in the Bhagavata Purana. Narada's eulogy and prophesy about Kamsa's death follows the account, where Narada decreed that Krishna would be called Keshava, the slayer of Keshi.Wilson pp. 339-42 Chapter 16 The Harivamsa from the epic Mahabharata also narrates the incident in a similar fashion complete with Narada's praise identifying Krishna as Vishnu. The Vishnu Purana and the Harivamsa (1st - 2nd century BCE) tell that Keshi is the last agent sent by Kamsa to kill Krishna, after Keshi's killing, Krishna and Balarama go to Mathura, where Kamsa is killed. However, the Bhagavata Purana describes the killing of the demon Vyoma sent by Kamsa, before he leaves for Mathura. The first century CE Buddhist writer Ashvaghosa also mentions the killing of Keshi in a passage in his Saundarananda. Origins In the Atharvaveda (2nd millennium BCE), Keshi, the \\"hairy one\\", first appears as being described as a demon who attacks the unborn, though not in relation to Krishna. A line from passage 8.6 which describes evils that attack female fetuses reads as: \\"Let us keep the black asura Ke≈õin, born in the reed clump, snout-mouthed and all other harmful creatures, away from her genitals and her loins\\" [IAST original]. Phyllis Granoff, a scholar on Indian religions, opines that the Keshi is a demon of childhood diseases or miscarriage, like the demoness Putana, who were both killed by the infant Krishna. However, this hypothesis is not unanimous. The tales of Keshi-vadha (\\"The killing of Keshi\\") are well known in the Kushan period (60-375 CE). Metropolitan Museum of Art parallels Krishna killing Keshi to the labour of Greek hero Heracles - slaying the horses of Diomedes, from which episode the former may be inspired. Keshi or Ke≈õƒ´ could be the earliest Sanskrit word known in Chinese; the (2nd century BCE) Huainanzi records treasures given in ransom for King Wen of Zhou to King Zhou of Shang in 1103 BCE, including the mount named jisi ÈõûÊñØ or Old Chinese *kese.Hoong Teik Toh (2010). \\"Notes on the Earliest Sanskrit Word Known in Chinese\\", Sino-Platonic Papers 201. Commemoration Keshighat in alt=Three boats parked near steps of a ghat built in yellow stones. According to the Malayalam Bhagavata Purana, Krishna got the name Keshava as he slew Keshi. Krishna is referred to as slayer of Keshi twice in the Bhagavata Gita by Arjuna - Keshava (1.30) and Keshi-nisudana (18.1). In the first chapter (1.30), addressing Krishna as slayer of Keshi, Arjuna expresses his doubts about war, at the same time, finds Krishna capable of destroying them. Here, Keshi represents false pride and the reference as slayer of Keshi by Arjuna expresses his humility. Keshi as a mad horse who created havoc in Gokula - also represents the wild horse of doubts who run in the mind of a person. In the last chapter (18.1), Arjuna addresses Krishna as Maha-baho (\\"mighty- armed\\") paired with the slayer of Keshi epithet, reminding the reader how Krishna killed Keshi with his arms alone. The Vishnu sahasranama (\\"The Thousand names of Vishnu\\") calls Krishna as Keshava (Names 23, 648) and Keshitha (649) - the slayer of Keshi. The fourth century play Mudrarakshasa also interprets the epithet Keshava as the slayer of Keshi. Keshighat is a major bathing ghat along the river Yamuna in Vrindavan, where Krishna is believed to have overpowered Keshi.

It is based on a faux-trailer of the same title featured in the Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez film Grindhouse.  Plot  A hobo arrives by boxcar in the city of Hope Town, its graffitied welcome sign reading \\"Scum Town\\". The city is brutally ruled over by a crime lord named \\"The Drake\\" and his sadistic sons Ivan and Slick. The Hobo sees an amateur filmmaker shooting a Bumfights-style movie. A bloodied man, Logan, the Drake's younger brother, screams for help. The Drake and his sons arrive and, labeling him a traitor to the townspeople, publicly decapitate him with a barbed-wire noose. Wishing to buy a lawnmower in a pawn shop, the Hobo begs for change on a sidewalk. However, after seeing a group of punks drag in a homeless man, he sneaks into the Drake's nightclub. Inside, the brothers and their henchmen torture and kill homeless people in arcade- style games. Slick begins harassing a boy named Otis, who owes him money, and Ivan snaps Otis' arm. Abby, a prostitute, defends Otis. Slick prepares to kill her, but the Hobo knocks him unconscious and carries him to the police station. There, he learns of the police chief's corruption and complicity in criminal activities. The brothers and the chief carve \\"scum\\" into his chest and throw him into a garbage bin. He meets Abby, who helps him recover. The next day, the Hobo goes to the filmmaker and completes a series of degrading acts, including chewing glass, to get enough money to buy the lawn mower. After getting his money and entering the pawn shop, a trio of robbers enter and hold a woman and her baby hostage. The Hobo grabs a shotgun from the shelf and kills the robbers. Realizing that Hope Town needs justice, he buys the shotgun, costing the same as the lawnmower, and kills dozens of criminals, including the filmmaker, a pimp, a coke lord, and a pedophile dressed as Santa Claus. The Drake, infuriated, lets his sons loose. They burn a school bus filled with children ‚Äî who are friendly to hobos ‚Äî and burst into a television station, killing the anchorman during a live broadcast ‚Äî who had expressed his appreciation of the hobo; they demand that all homeless people be killed. The Drake then joins them and orders the Hobo be brought to him. A mass murder of the city's vagrants begins. As Abby is walking home, a cop attempts to rape her. The Hobo kills him and Abby smuggles The Hobo past a group in a shopping cart covered with the cop's remains. The pair are spotted by Otis, who informs Slick and Ivan. Back at her apartment, the Hobo tells Abby of his plan to start a lawnmowing business, which she enthusiastically supports. Ivan and Slick enter and attack the two, wounding Abby. The Hobo overpowers Slick, holds him at gunpoint, and forces Ivan to leave. The Hobo then shoots Slick in the groin, avenging Logan and the 12 kids from the school bus, and takes Abby to the hospital. Slick manages to call the Drake before he is taken to hell in a burning school bus. The Drake, mourning the death of his favorite son, summons \\"The Plague\\", a duo of armor-clad demons named Rip and Grinder. While Abby is recovering, the Hobo visits the maternity ward and delivers a monologue to the babies. When he returns to Abby's room, the Plague capture and deliver him to the Drake, who plans to publicly execute him. Recovered, Abby returns to the pawn shop for weapons. Attaching an axe to the Hobo's shotgun and retrofitting the lawnmower into a shield, she arms a crowd to free the Hobo and bring down the Drake. She confronts the Drake, holding Ivan hostage; the Drake shoots and denounces him a disappointment. In the ensuing fight, Abby kills Grinder. Although the Drake severs Abby's hand with the lawnmower shield, she stabs him repeatedly with her exposed arm bone and incapacitates him. Rip tries to persuade Abby to be his partner, but the Hobo drives him off. The townspeople, motivated by Abby's bravery, have shown up with their own weapons and proceed to aim them at the shocked police, who demand that they leave the area. Seeing that the police will kill the people they failed to protect against the criminals, the Hobo tells the Drake that on their upcoming ride to Hell \\"You're riding shotgun,\\" and blows his head off. The police open fire on the Hobo and the people avenge him and turn their guns on the police. Both groups shoot each other, while the Hobo dies and Abby's screams are heard. The corrupt police are killed and the Drake's influence and his crimes against humanity in the town come to an end. = Alternative ending = In an extended ending that was taken out from the final cut of the film, Abby's hand is replaced by a gatling-style shotgun, as she becomes the new member of the Plague.  Cast  * Rutger Hauer as the Hobo: a homeless man who becomes a vigilante after witnessing Hope Town's high crime rate and corrupt, ineffective police. * Molly Dunsworth as Abby: a local prostitute who befriends the Hobo, she became at first horrified by his actions then after watching his bravery decides to help him. * Brian Downey as The Drake: A ruthless, psychopathic crime lord of Hope Town, the father of Ivan and Slick. * Gregory Smith as Slick: Drake's favorite son and Ivan's brother. Slick is a highly remorseless, sadistic, and cold killer. His father prefers him over Ivan due to his intelligence and leadership skills. * Nick Bateman as Ivan: Drake's son and Slick's equally sadistic brother. * Nick Bateman and Peter Simas as The Plague, (Rip and Grinder): two armored demons who seem to be contract killers with a hit list of historical and Biblical figures such as Abraham Lincoln and Jesus Christ. * Robb Wells as Logan, Drake's brother and a traitor for hobos * Jeremy Akerman as the Chief of Police * David Brunt as a corrupt police officer * Pasha Ebrahimi as the \\"Bumfights\\" director * George Stroumboulopoulos as the News Anchor  Development  Hobo with a Shotgun, directed by Jason Eisener, was initially a fake trailer made for an international contest to promote the release of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez's double feature Grindhouse. It won the contest, and was screened in some areas of Canada as part of the actual release of Grindhouse. A feature- length version of Hobo With a Shotgun began principal photography in Halifax on April 19, 2010. A teaser trailer (including behind-the-scenes and test footage) was released on April 26, 2010. David Brunt, who played the homeless man in the trailer, cameos in the film as a cop. It was the second of Grindhouses fake trailers to be turned into a feature film, the first being Machete. (Machete was also followed by a sequel, Machete Kills.) The opening theme music was borrowed from the exploitation film Mark of the Devil. The song \\"Run with Us\\", performed by Lisa Lougheed, from the 1980s animated series The Raccoons, is played in the end credits.  Release  Hobo with a Shotgun staged its world premiere at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival. The film was released on a limited basis to Canadian theatres on March 25, 2011 and in the United States on May 6, 2011. The film was also released via OnDemand services such as Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, and iTunes on April 1, 2011.  Home media  The film received its Australian premiere on the opening night of the Sydney Film Festival on June 8, 2011. It was later released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in the United States on July 5, 2011 and in the UK on July 15, 2011.  Reception  Reviews of the film are generally positive, and it currently holds a 66% \\"certified fresh\\" approval rating out of 119 reviews on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 5.7 out of 10 with the consensus being, \\"It certainly isn't subtle ‚Äì or even terribly smart ‚Äì but as a gleefully gory homage to low-budget exploitation thrillers, Hobo with a Shotgun packs plenty of firepower.\\"  References   External links   Category:2011 films Category:2010s action thriller films Category:American films Category:American action thriller films Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian action thriller films Category:Dystopian films Category:English-language films Category:American exploitation films Category:Features based on short films Category:Film spin-offs Category:Films shot in Nova Scotia Category:Grindhouse (film) Category:American splatter films Category:American vigilante films ","title":"Hobo with a Shotgun"},{"id":"27116976","text":"Luis Ricardo Falero (May 23, 1851 - December 7, 1896), Duke of Labranzano, was a Spanish painter.

His interest and knowledge of astronomy also led him to illustrate the works of Camille Flammarion. In 1896, the year of his death, Maud Harvey sued Falero for paternity. The suit alleged that Falero seduced Harvey when she was 17, first serving as his housemaid, and then model. When he discovered she was pregnant, he dismissed her.

HEPEX was launched in 2004 as an independent, cooperative international scientific activity. During the first meeting, the overarching goal was defined as to develop and test procedures to produce reliable hydrological ensemble forecasts, and to demonstrate their utility in decision making related to the water, environmental and emergency management sectors Key questions of HEPEX are: * What adaptations are required for meteorological ensemble systems to be coupled with hydrological ensemble systems? * How should the existing hydrological ensemble prediction systems be modified to account for all sources of uncertainty within a forecast? * What is the best way for the user community to take advantage of ensemble forecasts and to make better decisions based on them? The applications of Hydrological Ensemble Predictions span across large spatio-temporal scales ranging from short-term and very localized predictions to global climate change modeling. HEPEX is organised around six major themes: * Input and pre-processing * Ensemble techniques and process modelling * Data assimilation * Post-processing * Verification * Communication and use in decision making  Organisation of HEPEX  HEPEX is currently co-chaired by NOAA, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast and the European Commission Joint Research Centre. Co-chairs are elected during plenary HEPEX meetings. There is no formal membership for HEPEX. The HEPEX community is established through active participation of scientists, end users and decision makers in research, discussions and exchange of information on topics related to probabilistic hydrological predictions for floods, droughts, water management or related topics. The community has been very active with growing importance. Information on the initiative and the possibility to actively contribute to ongoing discussions can be found on the HEPEX website.

The Haynsworth Street Campus (Edmunds High) was for grades 11 and 12 while the Council Street Campus (Lincoln High) was for grade 10. The original school, built in 1925, was called \\"The Boys School\\" located on Haynsworth Street with \\"The Girls School\\" located on Calhoun Street. The Boys School and Girls School then became coeducational in 1939 on the Haynsworth Street school and was named Edmunds High School in memory of Superintendent Samuel Henry Edmunds. The Girls School became Calhoun Junior High and then McLaurin Junior High in 1950 in memory of Superintendent Linnie McLaurin. The colors were purple and white. This color combination represented the merging of the two junior high schools: McLaurin Junior High School, whose colors were red and white, and Alice Drive Junior High (now Alice Drive Middle School), with colors blue and white. In 1970, when Lincoln and Edmunds High Schools integrated and were renamed Sumter High School, the colors became the current blue and gold. In 1975 McLaurin Junior High became the Sumter High McLaurin campus for grade 9 making Sumter High a three-campus system. In 1980, Sumter High abandoned the McLaurin campus and 9th grade was moved to the Council Street Campus with 10th grade until the opening of the new Sumter High School on McCrays Mill Road in 1983. The current location on McCrays Mill Road was opened in 1983 for grades 10 to 12, with the Haynsworth Street Campus for grade 9. Since opening, Sumter High has undergone many expansions and renovations. First expansion came in 1985 in what is now known as B Hall math department which opened in 1987. In 1987, grade 9 from the Haynsworth Street campus was moved to McCrays Mill Road. Then in 1987 expansion for C hall computer and social studies started and was completed in 1989, making Sumter High the largest high school in South Carolina. Again in 2003 a new main entrance and office was built, a second gym, new science wing and a new auditorium for the arts; the 2003 additions opened to students in fall 2005 for the Class of 2006. The 2003 renovations included a new guidance office and attendance office and renovations of science classes. Then in 2014 a new floor and new tables were added to the commons. On July 1, 2011, Sumter School Districts 17 and 2 were consolidated into Sumter School District. The original school on Haynsworth now houses the Sumter County Cultural Center, which includes the Sumter Gallery of Art, a Performing Arts Center known as Patriot Hall, and a drama theatre known as Sumter Little Theatre. The Haynsworth Street Campus also houses the Sumter County Recreation and Parks department and the Sumter School District Annex. The Council Street campus now houses Trinity Lincoln Center, part of Trinity United Methodist church on Liberty Street. The McLaurin Junior High School on Calhoun Street now houses Grace Baptist Church.

The term The Meeting of the Two Yings originates from the first character of both leaders' personal names (). The debate was on the ECFA and related issues, and was broadcast on Sunday of April 25, 2010 by the Public Television Service. This was the first time the Republic of China President held a policy debate with the opposition. Ma himself also claimed the debate to be a first between the president and the opposition party chairperson.www.etaiwannews.com/-2010-04-25 Debate =Basic= The debate consisted of three parts and lasted for a duration of 142 minutes in total. It focused on the proposed economic agreement between Taiwan and Mainland China called the ECFA. Ma represents the Kuomintang party in government, and claims Taiwan must sign an ECFA with the People's Republic of China in order to prevent Taiwan from being marginalized as a regional economy as other countries in the region become more integrated. Tsai disagreed with these claims, and stated that the government must get consent from the Taiwanese citizens through a referendum before signing the agreement. She expressed concerns that the trade pact could undermine Taiwan's sovereignty and lead to an influx of cheap Chinese products into Taiwan's market, which would hurt local industries with lower profits, higher unemployment and a lower average income. The second round was held in Taoyuan County (now Taoyuan County).Ko Shu-ling, Taipei Times 2010/04/02 The third round of talks took place on June 12, 2010 in Beijing with an agreement on list of products and services approved for tariff cuts. =Content= In the debate, Tsai asked if Ma would allow a floodgate of Chinese imports into Taiwan. Ma responded with a guarantee that Chinese agriculture products and labor would not be allowed into Taiwan. The Taiwanese people were not convinced on the issue.www.nownews.com/- 2010-04-26 Moreover, Tsai said that Taiwan would have to open the whole market internationally within ten years after signing the agreement.

Economists Dan Rosen and Wang Zhi of the Peterson Institute for International Economics thinks the deal could add a net 5.3 percent to Taiwan's economy by 2020. Rosen and Wang described the ECFA as \\"an ambitious accord that fundamentally changes the game between Taiwan and China and hence affects the regional economy and even the transpacific tempo for the United States.\\" =Criticism= There is currently much controversy in Taiwan over the ECFA, including over potential effects on local Taiwanese businesses,Taipei Times 2009/07/31 as well as on how the government has presented it to the public. The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and other pro-independence groups believe the ECFA is a cover for unification with mainland China. Neither does it accord the same rights as a Free Trade Agreement which will reduce manufacturing jobs and average salary, accelerate capital outflow and brain drain of management and technology expertise. The opponents of the ECFA also indicated concerns about allowing the influx of mainland Chinese white-collar workers or professionals to work in Taiwan which could put the job security of locals at risk. The Bureau of Foreign Trade under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has allayed those concerns indicating the professional job market would not be included in the talks. In addition, a series of cartoons created by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (Republic of China) attempted to explain the ECFA stereotyped local ethnic groups and their responses to the agreement, and was withdrawn after much controversy.Taipei Times 2009/07/29 The opposition party tried to put the ECFA agreement to the Taiwanese public through a referendum. However, the government has denied the proposal on the grounds that the proposal addressed a hypothetical situation and failed to satisfy legal requirements.

Geography It is located approximately east of the town of New Amsterdam, Guyana along the one and only main road. Part of Albion is known as Albion High Reef. Demographics The town has 1,424 inhabitants as of 2012, 95% of which are Indians from India, vast majority of them were Madrasi (Tamils) whose ancestors came over on British ships from India beginning in 1838, in the capacity of indentured laborers, to work on the giant sugar plantations in British Guiana. The remaining 5% of the population in Albion is split between Blacks, Amerindians (native indigenous tribes from South America), and Chinese. Economy Albion is home to the largest sugar manufacturer in the Caribbean region. Electric and municipal water supplies, even though they were available in many areas since the 1970s, they were first made available in 1998 to areas that were once squatting areas prior to 1998. The people live entirely off the land, growing eggplant, tomatoes, squash, melons, spinach, eddoe (or taro leaf), okra, and a wide number of tropical fruits like guava, mango, coconut, banana, and star apple. Fish are also readily available in the many trenches that lead out to the Atlantic Ocean, as well as shrimp, crab, snails, and also many wild birds. Flora and fauna Albion, like all of Guyana, is heavily infested with several types of mosquitoes, though diseases like dengue and yellow fever, as well as malaria, have almost completely been eradicated in the Albion coastal areas. Still, the mosquitoes and flies are quite a constant harassment, and people must sleep under mosquito nets. Cuisine The cuisine is quite interesting, as it has retained very much of its East Indian quality. Curries cooked with garam masala and other Indian spices are very common, and Hindu and Muslim holidays are celebrated in much the same way as in India to this day. Entertainment Indian movies are watched on a daily basis. Many, if not all of the movie theatres that were once part of life up until the 1990s are gone and replaced by home entertainment systems. The availability of TV sets in the 1990s revolutionized the way movies are now watched. Points of Interest The Albion Sports Complex is an entertainment and sports venue, and is one of the home grounds of the Guyana cricket team. The stadium hosted its first international cricket match on 16 March 1977, between West Indies and Pakistan and won by the West Indies by four wickets. It was the first ODI match in the Caribbean. The venue has hosted five One Day Internationals but none for over two decades.http://cricket.yahoo.com/ground- profile/Albion%20Sports%20Complex,%20Berbice%20-%20Guyana_3 Many great cricketers started their careers representing Albion Sports Complex Club, Test cricketer Sew Shivnarine and Guyanese representatives Amarnauth Ramcharitar, Kamal Singh, Suresh Ganouri and Michael Chin.

Biography Michael Rosen was one of three sons of Rabbi Yaakov Kopul and Bella Rosen. He was born in Glasgow, Scotland. His thinking was strongly influenced by his father, who rejected fundamentalism and obscurantism and instead embraced secular wisdom while remaining committed to religious life. Rosen was first educated at Carmel College, the school his father had founded based on this philosophical orientation. He then continued his education at the Slabodka Yeshiva and the Grodno Yeshiva Beer Yaakov, both in Bnei Brak. He received semikhah from the latter in 1973. In addition, he studied at the Harry Fischel Institute for Talmudic Research in Jerusalem, and was presented with a second semikhah by Chief Rabbi Isser Yehuda Unterman. After serving as a rabbi near Manchester, Rosen opened a Jewish educational center in London in 1978 called Yakar ‚Äì Center for Tradition and Creativity, whose name is an acronym of his father's name, Yaakov Kopul Rosen, and also means precious or worthy in the Hebrew language. In 1992 he established a Yakar center in Jerusalem and, in 2007, another in Tel Aviv. What was unique about the Yakar concept was that it blended traditional Jewish learning with social action, interfaith dialogue and the arts. In 1994, Rosen received a Ph.D. from University College London after submitting a dissertation entitled A Commentary on Job Attributed to Rashbam. In 2008 he published a book about Hasidic Judaism entitled The Quest for Authenticity: The Thought of Reb Simchah Bunim. He spent his last three weeks in coma after a fall. He was buried on 9 December 2008 in the Har HaMenuchot cemetery in Jerusalem. He was survived by his wife, Gilla, six children, seven grandchildren, his two brothers, Rabbi Jeremy Rosen and Rabbi David Rosen, and his sister, Angela. He was widely considered one of the most popular and revered Anglo-immigrant rabbis in Israel.

In 2017, EJP had a 5-year impact factor of 4.2, which has increased since 2013 (from 2.9). Moreover, based on impact factor, the journal ranked 2nd of all the empirical journals in the social-personality field, and 1st when looking at journals exclusively devoted to research on personality. EJP seeks to promote the development of empirical and theoretical work in personality psychology. It publishes papers relevant to advancing the field of personality in the broadest sense, and encompasses topics such as the nature of personality, expressions of personality in a social context, personality development, and the consequences of personality. EJP also publishes work on methodological advances in research on personality. It is abstracted in many of the leading abstracting services including Psychological Abstracts/PsycINFO, Social Sciences Citation Index, and Web of Science. Since 2017, EJP has also implemented new editorial policies to promote the transparency of work published in the journal. EJP requires a minimal standard of reporting (e.g., sample size justification), and promotes the sharing of materials and data to the authors via Open Science badges. According to numbers in early 2019, the percentage of articles that were published in 2016 to 2019 that received one or more Open Science badges (i.e., Open Material badge, Open Data badge, and the pre-registration badge) has gone up from 2% in 2016 to nearly 70% in 2018. Moreover, in February 2019, EJP ranked third for transparency on a list of the Center for Open Science (along with Collabra: Psychology; calculated based on implementation of the Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) guidelines). EJP introduced two new options in the submission process in 2018. The journal now encourages authors to submit registered reports.

The film stars Sean Patrick Flanery, Joe Pantoliano, Carmen Serano, and Greg Serano. Plot Detective Tom (Sean Patrick Flanery) and his partner Ryan Alba (Greg Serano) have spent the last three years unsuccessfully trying to locate the Lion (Joe Pantoliano), an international hitman that has always eluded their grasp. They believe that they've found his location via a tipster but instead find Tom's wife Kelly (Michelle Greathouse) tied up in a basement filled with explosives, surrounded by a black outline. The Lion calls Tom and commands him to kill Kelly or risk the entire house blowing up and killing everyone inside. Any attempt to evacuate the house or rescue Kelly will result in everyone getting blown up and the Lion will not accept any substitutions, as he wants Tom to suffer for messing up the Lion's network in the Southwestern United States. His only mercy is that Tom may turn out the lights in the basement. With no other option, Tom has the lights turned off and he shoots and kills Kelly. The film flashes forwards to eight years later to show a grieving Tom, who is now retired and living in Mexico. As he's had past experiences dealing with the Lion, FBI agent Isabel Ordonez (Carmen Serano) travels out to persuade him to help track down and capture the Lion. She shows him evidence that the Lion will be meeting associates at a nightclub. Tom refuses but secretly copies down the address so he can take his own revenge for Kelly's death. At the nightclub Tom is initially unsuccessful at tracking down the Lion as he does not know what the other man looks like, even as the Lion walks directly past him in order to meet with his associate. The Lion, who is aware of the presence of both Tom and the FBI agents, receives his requested materials from his associate before killing the associate and detonating a bomb to cover his escape. Tom quickly follows after the Lion and after an extended chase scene, the Lion manages to subdue Tom and is about to cut his throat when an unmarked police car enters the alley, forcing the Lion to abandon Tom and make his escape. The FBI agent driving the car, \\"Hops\\" (David House), mistakes Tom for one of the Lion's associates and tries to arrest him. Hops is later corrected on this and Tom is brought on to assist the FBI's talk force along with his old partner Ryan, who is now part of the FBI. The FBI believes that the Lion is targeting Senator Cordero (Fredrick Lopez), who used to be a DEA agent. As more bombs go off, the Lion's true identity is revealed (David Kaplow) and he kidnaps Ryan's daughter in an attempt to have Ryan assassinate Cordero in exchange for his daughter's safety. He's successful, as Ryan does as he's instructed, but Ryan is in turn shot and killed by Cordero's bodyguard. Eventually Kaplow makes his big move and bombs the FBI headquarters, during which time he kidnaps Ordonez. Tom makes his way to Ordonez's house, where he sees that Kaplow has tied her up and strapped a bomb to the agent. The two men fight and Kaplow manages to force Tom to handcuff himself. A policeman arrives on the scene but is killed by Kaplow, who is wounded in the process. Kaplow then escapes the house and detonates the bomb, believing that this is the end of Tom and Ordonez. However Kaplow then receives a call from Tom stating that they are not dead and that Kaplow's bullet proof vest is rigged to bombs. Finally, Tom detonates the bomb and Kaplow explodes inside the police car.

Reception Critical reception for Deadly Impact has been largely negative. Reviewers for DVD Talk panned the film, with one writing \\"Rather uninspired and more than a little bit predictable, Deadly Impact doesn't really bring much of interest to a genre already riddled with clich√©s.\\" DVD Verdict also panned Deadly Impact, cautioning readers that it was \\"one hell of a bomb\\" and to \\"[not] waste any time on this dud\\". Beyond Hollywood was also critical in their review, stating that \\"Deadly Impact is an almost painful experience to behold, even when compared to the stuff Steven Seagal and Val Kilmer are pumping out these days. After the film‚Äôs mildly intriguing opening number, the production promptly loses its cinematic footing and never recovers.\\" References External links Deadly Impact at Film Affinity * Deadly Impact action thriller is scheduled for April 20 release at DVDTown.com * Q&A; with Deadly Impact director Robert Kurtzman at Clevescene.com * Robert Kurtzman and David Greathouse Interview at Killer Reviews * Robert Kurtzman at Movie Hole Category:2009 films Category:2009 action thriller films Category:2009 direct- to-video films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Robert Kurtzman Category:Films set in New Mexico Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer direct-to-video films ","title":"Deadly Impact"},{"id":"27117433","text":"Selenginsky (masculine), Selenginskaya (feminine), or Selenginskoye (neuter) may refer to: *Selenginsky District, a district of the Republic of Buryatia, Russia *Selenginskoye Urban Settlement, a municipal formation which Selenginsk Urban-Type Settlement in Kabansky District of the Republic of Buryatia is incorporated as ","title":"Selenginsky"},{"id":"27117469","text":"Neocampanella is a genus of fungus in the family Marasmiaceae.

After Irene's rise to sole rule, Aetios developed an intense rivalry with her eunuch chief minister Staurakios. After Staurakios's death, Aetios became the leading man in the state. He plotted to usurp the throne for his brother, Leo, but lost power when Irene was deposed in 802. Biography =Early years and rivalry with Staurakios= solidus of Empress Irene during her sole rule (r. 797‚Äì802). Aetios first appears in 790, when he was a protospatharios and a confidant of Irene, then the Roman empress-mother and regent for her young son, Emperor Constantine VI (r. 780‚Äì797). In the autumn of that year, Irene tried to sideline her son and assume full rule over the Roman Empire. This, however, caused a mutiny by the army in favour of the young emperor. Constantine was installed as sole ruler, Irene confined to a palace in Constantinople, and her eunuch prot√©g√©s, including Aetios, were exiled... Aetios was restored to his position, along with the other eunuchs, when Irene was recalled to power as a co-ruler in 792.. In August 797, Irene and her powerful eunuch minister Staurakios succeeded in overthrowing and blinding (and possibly also killing) Constantine, thus assuming governance of the state. However, the uncles of the deposed emperor, the surviving younger sons of Emperor Constantine V (r. 741‚Äì775), who had in the past been involved in plots against Irene, were still a potential threat. They were persuaded by sympathizers to seek refuge in the cathedral of Hagia Sophia, where the capital's populace would supposedly rally to them and declare one of them as emperor. No such support materialized; instead, Aetios managed to achieve their surrender, and they were exiled to Irene's home town of Athens.. Irene now divided her favour between Staurakios, her old-established chief minister, and Aetios. This began a period of intense rivalry between the two and their respective supporters, as they raced to place their relatives in positions of power, so as to secure control of the empire after Irene's eventual death... This competition came to the fore in 797/798, and intensified in May 799, when Irene fell seriously ill. Aetios, who had won the backing of Niketas Triphyllios, the commander of the Scholai guards, accused Staurakios before the Empress of plotting to usurp the throne. Irene duly convened a council at the Palace of Hieria where she severely rebuked her favourite minister, but Staurakios escaped with an apology.. Staurakios in turn began to distribute bribes amongst the men and lower officers of the Scholai and Exkoubitores regiments, trying to win their support for an eventual coup. Aetios again went to Irene, who in February 800 forbade anyone from the military to contact Staurakios. Coupled with Aetios's own appointment to the powerful post of strategos of the Anatolic Theme, this restored a precarious balance between the two camps. Soon after, Staurakios became very ill, but he continued plotting against Aetios, instigating a revolt against him in Cappadocia before dying in June 800. =Supremacy and downfall of Aetios= The revolt was quickly and brutally subdued, and with his rival's death, Aetios stood supreme amongst Empress Irene's court. He likely succeeded Staurakios as logothetes tou dromou, while retaining control of the Anatolics and adding to his command the Opsician Theme. He gained a victory in 800 against the Arabs, which was followed, however, by a defeat in 801.. In 801/802, Aetios appointed his brother Leo as monostrategos of the themes of Thrace and Macedonia. Controlling thus the armies closest to Constantinople, which comprised about a third of the empire's entire military forces, he was well placed to make Leo emperor. In the words of the chronicler Theophanes the Confessor, he \\"ruled by [Irene's] side and was usurping power on behalf of his brother\\". Consequently, in 802, Aetios was instrumental in the rejection of a marriage offer from Charlemagne, which Irene had apparently seriously considered.. Aetios's plans for his brother's elevation faltered with the opposition of the other courtiers, who resented his influence and the insulting manner with which he treated them. Chief among them were Nikephoros, Irene's finance minister (logothetes tou genikou), but also Niketas Triphyllios, Aetios's former ally, and Leo Sarantapechos, a relative of the empress. Fearing an imminent coup by Aetios, the conspirators, in the morning of October 31, 802, entered the Great Palace and acclaimed Nikephoros emperor. Irene was deposed and allowed to retire to a convent.. It is not known what became of Aetios after that. He most likely lost power upon Nikephoros's accession, but he may be the patrikios Aetios who was killed, along with Nikephoros himself, in the Battle of Pliska against the Bulgars on July 26, 811.

Jenkins Hilliard P. Jenkins (February 29, 1922 - August 23, 1992) was an American farmer, philanthropist, and civic leader. His family homestead, located in Loxley, Alabama, was considered one of the state's richest farms, and he earned distinction for his agricultural techniques.\\"Alabama's Richest Farm Family,\\" Ebony, August 1953. Jenkins also maintained leadership positions in a number of statewide and county organizations, including the Alabama Democratic Conference. Farm life One of 10 children, Jenkins was a lifelong resident of Loxley. His father, John Wesley Jenkins, purchased a turpentine farm in 1926. After his death in 1935, the custody of the farm fell to Jenkins' mother, Amelia Taylor Jenkins, and the older Jenkins children. Jenkins Farmhouse Over the next two and a half decades, Amelia oversaw the dramatic growth of the farm into a enterprise. When Jenkins came of age, he became general manager of the farm and continued to increase the farm's productivity, all while cultivating a wide variety of crops that enjoyed harvests throughout the entire growing season. Jenkins Farm historical marker During his youth, Jenkins, despite a lack of formal agricultural training, had a knack for learning the best scientific farming practices. His self-taught knowledge of agricultural methods and their application helped make the farm a vastly profitable enterprise that earned the Jenkins prestige among farmers white and black. He also garnered the Negro Farm Family Merit Award, bestowed by the Tuskegee Institute in 1952. The Jenkins' financial and social stature gained them national press in Ebony magazine. Public service As an Alabamian living under Jim Crow, Jenkins followed an example set by Amelia of using economic power to improve the sociopolitical status of fellow African-American neighbors. Employees of the Jenkins farm had the freedom and assistance to engage in community organizing and political activities like voting drives, unlike their counterparts whose white employers typically who did not lend support or, more commonly, sought to clamp down on their political activities. For several decades, Jenkins was committed to public service in various ways, often as a community organizer. An advocate for a wider African-American vote, he was a longtime member of the Alabama Democratic Conference (ADC), which seeks to raise the political status of African-Americans and increase their participation in the political system. For over 20 years, he served as chairman of the ADC's Baldwin County unit.

The building dates from 1897. It was designed by Manuel V. Domenech, a Puerto Rican architect that was responsible for designing various other now-historic buildings. Domenech built this residence for Ponce mayor Pedro Juan Rosaly. Domenech himself became mayor of Ponce and held numerous other political positions in Puerto Rico. The Batiz Residence is a monument to a great man and his works and a vivid reminder of the aristocracy of the years prior to the Great Depression.Mariano G.

September 29, 1986. History and significance The Batiz Residence was built in 1897 by the renown engineer Manuel Domenech for the Mayor of the City of Ponce, Don Pedro Juan Rosaly. A native of Ponce, Domenech graduated from the prestigious Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute of New York and was responsible for many of the island's most lavish turn-of-the-century buildings. Among Domenech's other designs are the Caryatid House (1910) which faces the Ponce Cathedral and the \\"Asilo de Pobres\\" (listed in the National Register on 2 December 1985). Domenech was also Mayor of the City of Ponce and held many governmental positions in Puerto Rico. Although a particular style cannot be attributed to Domenech, the vocabulary of his designs ranged from the purest Neoclassical to the most intricate eccletic. In this case, Domenech referred to the Renaissance Italian Palazzo as a model, a theme repeated in other properties both in Ponce and Mayaguez. However stern, the Batiz Residence displays a greater degree of mannerism over eclecticism, resulting in one of Ponce's most distinguished structures. Sale of the residence The property was purchased in the 1920s as the city residence of Antonio Batiz Olivera, a wealthy coffee plantation owner. During his visits to Ponce the house was said to be filled with light and music. Great balls, concerts and intellectual gatherings characterized the Batiz family and, thus, the house. The structure has never been altered from what Domenech designed. Only minor maintenance work has been carried out during its many years of forgotten splendor. The Batiz Residence today is a monument to the great man that Domenech was and his works, and a vivid reminder of the aristocracy of the years prior to the Great Depression. Physical appearance and description The Batiz Residence is located on the southeast corner of Villa Street at Mendez Vigo Street. It occupies a plot of land 1145 meters square, bordered by Villa Street on the north and Luna Street on the south.Mariano G.

September 29, 1986. This structure of stuccoed brick and rubble consists of two stories set on a podium approximately four feet above street level. The property follows a \\"U\\" shaped plan, creating a rectangular courtyard enclosed at the rear by a garden wall. The roof is flat, of wood and brick construction. The main facade is divided into five bays in an A-B-A rhythm established by a single-bay central section and flanking two-bay sections. Rustic quoins turn the east and west corners of the facade. An italianate cornice spans the roof-line between the rusticated quoins. At the first level, a recessed loggia is created by an arcade of segmental arches supported by diminished Doric columns on pedestals. Balusters enclose the arcade. The central bay is separated from the rest by a one-storey pair of rusticated pilasters. This bay breaks the podium for access to the main entrance and incorporates a round arch beginning at a point lower than the other arches. Inside the loggia the central doorway is flanked by rusticated segmental arches with full-height, double-shutter jalousies. A continuous string course separates the first floor from the second. At the upper level there are five rusticated openings similar to those of the first storey. The three inner bays open to a continuous balcony with wrought iron railing in intricate decorative patterns. Iron trellises support a decorative balcony roof. The west facade is divided by rusticated pilasters into three sections of two, three, and one bay respectively, from north to south. South of the sixth bay extends a one-storey section which serves as a port-cochere. The fenestration at the west facade is similar to that at the main, except with circular arches at the upper level. At the lower level, another circular arch of larger proportions opens at the sixth bay. The interiors are divided into three separate apartments: two similarly distributed residential units at the first level and a single large apartment at the second. The living quarters, kitchen, and servants' quarters of the upper floor are reached via a series of louvered galleries that open to the courtyard. The living room boasts original crystal chandeliers and electric features. Floors are generally of polished wood and ceilings of ornate pressed sheet-metal. The living room windows open to the balcony which has marble floors and iron railings. The Batiz Residence remains a magnificent example of the architectural trends of the aristocracy of Ponce.

Two members of the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) and one Black and Tan were also killed in the action. Background The IRA in west Mayo was relatively quiet until January 1921, when Michael Kilroy, described as, \\"a puritanical and ascetic blacksmith\\"Michael Hopkinson, The Irish War of Independence, p. 134 took over command of the Brigade after Tom Derrig was arrested by the British. Kilroy formed a relatively large \\"flying column\\" of 40‚Äì50 men to carry out attacks on British forces in the area. On 6 May they suffered a reverse at Islandeady, when a British patrol came upon the IRA men cutting a road; three volunteers were killed and two captured.Hopkinson, p. 134 Ambush On 18 May 1921, the IRA decided to attack an RIC/Black and Tan convoy at Kilmeena. Two small-unit attacks were made on the RIC barracks in Newport and Westport to try to draw the police out of their well-defended barracks. One RIC man died in these attacks.Hopkinson, p. 134 At 3am the next day, 19 May, the column of 41 IRA men took up position close to Knocknabola Bridge. The British convoy, travelling from Newport to Westport, consisted of two Crossley lorries and one Ford touring car‚Äîa total of about 30 men. The convoy did not arrive until 3pm and its arrival sparked a two-hour fire-fight. In the battle, one RIC man, Beckett, was wounded and later died. The British regrouped around the house of the parish priest, Father Conroy, and launched a counterattack. Four IRA volunteers were killed. They were Seamus Mc Evilly, Thomas O'Donnell, Patrick Staunton and Sean Collins.

The remainder of the column, carrying their wounded, fled over the mountains to Skerdagh, where they had safe houses. However, the British tracked them there and, in another exchange of fire, another IRA man was killed, Jim Brown from Newport.Hopkinson, p. 134 Aftermath The Black and Tans threw the dead and wounded IRA men on to the street outside the RIC barracks in nearby Westport, causing widespread revulsion among the local people and local police. The Marquis of Sligo, no friend of the republican guerrillas, visited the barracks to complain of their treatment of enemy dead. At the funerals of those killed, in Castlebar, the British allowed only close family to attend and forbade the draping of the Irish tricolour over the coffins.Hopkinson, pp. 134-135 The local IRA blamed their defeat in the ambush on the failure of an IRA unit from Westport to show up in time. Kilroy's column managed to get some revenge for the setback at Kilmeena the following month (3 June) in an action at Carrowkennedy, where they killed seven policemen and captured 16.Hopkinson, p. 135 References Category:Conflicts in 1921 Category:Military actions and engagements during the Irish War of Independence Category:History of County Mayo Category:1921 in Ireland Category:Royal Irish Constabulary Category:March 1921 events Category:Ambushes ","title":"Kilmeena ambush"},{"id":"27117775","text":"The Senator Marcantonio Barbaro, painting by Tintoretto The Venetian Senate (), formally the Consiglio dei Pregadi (\\"Council of the Invited\\", ), was the main deliberative and legislative body of the Republic of Venice. The Senate originated as a select committee of sixty men, chosen by the Great Council, to deliberate on decrees concerning taxation, commerce, foreign policy, and military operations, instead of the far larger, and more unwieldy, Great Council. Initially it was junior to another similar committee, the Council of Forty, but in later centuries it grew in importance. By the 15th century, the Forty could join in an enlarged Senate, which was further expanded through an extraordinary commission (a zonta) of sixty men, nominated by the sitting Senators. Furthermore, ambassadors and senior military commanders held an ex officio position in the Senate from the day of their election to the end of the year after their return from their post. In total, about 300 men (out of an estimated nobility of 2,500 in 1500) had a seat in the Senate, but only about 230 of them had a right to vote. The minimum number for a quorum was set at 70, but more usually there were about 180 nobles in attendance. Election to the Senate was for terms of one year, but frequently the same men were continuously re-elected, ensuring both experience and continuity in political decision-making.

Consequently, people tried to escape when their life allowed. Preferred places of escape for those who could not afford to go on vacation to the Baltic Sea were the lakes in the vicinity. Especially suitable was the Greater Wannsee, with its broad and shallow, sandy eastern shore. Owing to the moral standards of the time, public bathing, especially with women and men in plain sight of each other, was illegal. In 1907, the administration of the Brandenburg Teltow district, southwest of Berlin, then the cognisant authority over the area, gave in to public pressure and officially allowed bathing on a 200-metre stretch of beach. Conduct was strictly regulated, down to details of dress laid down by police regulation. Construction works began on 8 May 1907. In 1909, a lease was signed between the royal government and a local merchant Frankenthal from Nikolassee. The Freibad Wannsee, as it was named, then consisted of one beach each for men and women, both 65 metres in length, separated by the family section that offered 350 metres of beach. The sections were separated with wooden fences. Tents, erected at the foot of the steeper incline towards the forest served as changing facilities, according to sections, and booths and mobile vendors provided services. The whole area was surrounded by fences to discourage those merely wanting to watch the proceedings. With the signing of the lease, use of the facilities required paying of a fee. After the First World War, the importance of the lido at the Wannsee increased, not only among the people of Berlin, but also in surrounding communities. After the lease ended, the municipality of Berlin took over, and the business became part of the municipal forest service, due to the location in the Grunewald. In the same year, 1924, the tents were replaced by thatched pavillons, and the sanitary facilities, lacking up until then, were improved. The area was expanded to 800 metres and was open year- round, making the facilities available to winter bathers and skaters. Attendance increased, especially after the S-Bahn from nearby Potsdam to Erkner was opened. One year counted 900.000 visitors. In 1926 Nearby stations Nikolassee and Wannsee eased access to the beach, and the existing facilities were no longer sufficient. Plans to erect a permanent building at the site had come up as early as 1910, by Martin Wagner, later municipal construction director, but had been delayed due to the First World War. Now, the municipality of Berlin tasked the same Martin Wagner and colleague Richard Ermisch, both employees of the city and experienced in public building, with planning a large scale improvement project. While Wagner was responsible for the whole ensemble and its arrangement, Ermisch took care of the architecture. Construction commenced in 1929, and opening of the new buildings was already one year later, in 1930. The Great Depression compromised the execution of the plans Wagner and Ermisch had come up with. Initially, the budget had been a sum of 5 million Reichsmark (RM) that was supposed to have been spent on an additional five of the two-storeyed halls, as well as a large, circular main restaurant, a pier with a caf√© on it, a marina and an open-air theater. Furthermore, a medicinal bath, a kindergarten and a pension had been thought of. Of all that, only the existing four-structure complex was realized, and only after the maior visited the site to see that most of the reduced project had already been built and would not require much further work. In the end, about 2 million Reichsmark were spent. In the years that followed, attendances reached record highs, as Berliners wanted to see their new public bath. On the other hand, with Nazism growing, fights between various political groups, as well as the staff, damaged the reputation of the lido as well as that of the director, Hermann Clajus, who had been in this position since 1926 and was responsible for the continued development of the site. The Nazis especially disliked the \\"un-german\\" architecture. A sign forbidding Jews to access the premises disappeared during the Olympics in 1936, but from 1938 on, Jews were by law prohibited to enter. The non-nazi staff was replaced by party members, and entertainment was provided by bands of the Wehrmacht and the SA. In 1935, the communal corporation that had conducted business since 1926 was disbanded, and management of the business first went into responsibility of borough of Wilmersdorf, then, after an administrative reform in 1937, that of Zehlendorf. Beach life During the Second World War, the lido provided welcome relief during dark times to the Berlin population that was still allowed to use it. Attendance still reached 425000 in 1944. Luckily, the buildings were not destroyed during the war. As then, after the war the place provided an escape from devastation and debris. In 1947, again 615000 people pay their fee, and in 1951, Conny Froboess sang Pack die Badehose ein (literally 'Pack your swimming trunks), one of the great hits of that time. Rarely during its existence had the lido to close. Some closures occurred during the Berlin Blockade, when due to power outages the waste pumps had to shut off and the waste would have soiled the lake. Later, in 1952, the danger presented by live gunfire from a nearby US-forces shooting range caused another closure. In later years, attendance dropped. New public baths competed for attention, the buildings deteriorated, increasing wealth allowed citizens to travel further than just to the Wannsee, and finally public transport by bus ceased, forcing people to walk from Nikolassee station or to compete for a lot in the limited parking area. Strandbad Wannsee 1907 - 2007 (german) In 2004, under the management of the Stiftung Denkmalschutz Berlin, restoration of the buildings and infrastructure began with the declared goal of restoring conditions to the original as accurately as possible and updating the antiquated equipment. The restoration included the recreation of the forecourt in front of the entrance to the lido. As the whole ensemble is listed, and not just the building, maintenance requires not only care for the construction, but also for the surrounding open and forest areas.Stiftung Denkmalschutz Berlin (german) Due to financial restraints, not all of the buildings have been fully restored: notably the former restaurant, aptly named \\"Lido\\", is still in its old derelict state. Buildings Cabin section Former beach front caf√© The buildings that R. Ermisch planned in the late 1920s were built in the style of New Objectivity. This called for simple, functional and unadorned structures and aesthetics deriving from the materials that were used rather than ornaments. For the Strandbad Wannsee, preferred material for facades is yellow clinker, the bricks lending the complex its characteristic hue. The complex consists of four large two-storeyed buildings, arranged in a row along and close to the hill flank parallel to the beach line. Construction is steel framework filled with clinker. The row of uniform structures is articulated by staircases between the individual buildings. They are connected by a closed- roof colonnade in front of them, providing a view of the lake and river. The roofs could be used as sun terraces. From a small balcony on that colonnade, lost children were announced before the invention of public address systems. Tagesspiegel, 08.05.2007 (german) Originally, the showers were located on the roof of the colonnade as well. In the 1930s, a restaurant on the premises, called \\"Wannseeterrassen\\" (Wannsee terraces) was erected in a manner that intentionally contrasted the modern designs by Ermisch with a more traditionally styled structure.

It was known as Judges Limited between 1910 and 1984.  Fred Judge  Fred Judge (11 June 1872 ‚Äì 23 February 1950) was an English photographer of all parts of the British Isles and founder of the company. Judge was born at Old Market Place, Wakefield, the son of Joseph Judge, a corn dealer, and Harriet Judge (n√©e Waldron). Judge moved from Wakefield in 1902 and purchased Algernon Booker‚Äôs photographic business at 21A Wellington Place, Hastings.Hastings & St. Leonards Weekly Mail And Times. Editions examined from August 1902 to September, 1910 and 1911 Initially his business directory entry makes no mention of postcards: ‚Äúlandscape photographer, lanternist and photographic materials dealer‚Äù. Apart from lantern shows, these activities continued to be a major part of his business, prior to 1910. The first Judges postcards were not produced until 1903. A newspaper advertisement of 15 August 1903 offers ‚ÄúP.O.P. postcards 12 costing 6d‚Äù (Printing Out Paper). This may refer to an arrangement with customers that the first postcards he produced were multiple copies of their photographs required for their own use. The earliest of the probably privately submitted cards known are three views for use by the nuns at the Convent Chapel at St Leonards-on-Sea. The earliest of these is postmarked 16 November 1903. Fred and/or his younger brother Thomas Winn Judge, who did much of the ‚Äúback office‚Äù work, were quick to exploit the new medium available to visitors; namely postcards, with a view on the front, that they could write a message on the back and post to their friends and relatives. Judges first published commercial card is probably a multi-view of the Great Storm of September 1903 of which a copy has been seen postmarked 4 October 1903. The only indication that these cards are by Judges is a tiny embossed Fred Judge on a corner of the card. By January 1904 other more general views of Hastings had been published in sepia bromide format. Other topics were produced including flowers and animals. Between 1903 and 1908 Fred produced many local views and always had his bicycle at the ready to take photographs of any local events or disasters and produce postcards for sale, often by the next day.Picture Postcards and their publishers by Anthony Byatt 1978 He was a keen member of his local photographic society and was able to promote himself nationally and internationally, receiving over 100 photographic medals and diplomas by 1908. In 1915 he joined the Royal Photographic Society and was elected a Fellow the same year.  Early production  Between 1903 and 1908, many different types of photographic paper were used although 'Printing Out Paper' was widely used, with prints developing in the sunlight coming in through the shop and other windows. The problem was producing cards in quantity, and Judges also sent batches of negatives to other printers in England and Germany for series of coloured cards produced in collotype and photo-lithography. However, a turning point seems to have been in 1906 with the move to larger premises at 42 White Rock and the purchase of an exposing machine from Ellis Graber of Tunbridge Wells. This machine could produce larger production runs of cards to a consistent format and quality. This coincided with the publication of the first 10 cards in the new main series (that was eventually to run from 50-31782) which were used in the Judges Postcard Voting Competition.An article by Andrew Reynolds in Picture Postcard Monthly, Nov 2003, pp.24-26. '100 years of Judges Postcards.' This article includes illustrations of Judges' postcards and gives fuller details of the card numbering. Initially black and white cards with a glossy surface were produced in this series before sepia tone became ubiquitous apparently because the tone was more sympathetic to being tinted. Formation of Judges Limited In 1910 the firm again moved to new premises, bought more new Graber machinery and was re-formed as Judges Limited, a wholesale producer of postcards. The former retail shop was sold to Marriott. By appointing sole agents to sell their cards in specific towns and cities and opening their own retail depots in others, Judges became a national manufacturer. A card dated 1911 exists, written by T.H.W. Judge, and signed Judges Ltd, with which Thomas Winn sought business from W H Smith in Nottingham.Registrar of Companies, file 106758 Production between 1918 and 1939 Towards the end of the First World War, the company experienced a shortage of paper and as a result had to buy some from Sanbride, or possibly sub contracted the printing to them. Judges was again at a turning point, but instead of closing Judges added ¬£10,000 of preference shares to the existing ¬£20,000 capital in 1920 to provide additional capital to build and equip a new machine shop, and open and stock additional wholesale and retail depots. Fred Judge took all the published negatives up to 7400 and probably up to 7699 but then in 1921 he took on Oliver Butler as an additional photographer who was carefully trained and monitored to ensure that his work was compatible and comparable with that of the master. Also by then Fred was using his artistic talents to produce packs of 4 or 6 lithographic sketch versions of certain cards and packs of 12 photogravure cards to offer cheaper alternatives. By the 1920s, the success of the company was partially because they were able to establish a recognisable brand, known for the consistency and high quality of its products. Examples show that purchasers of their cards have specifically referred in the message on the card to the fact that they have purchased a Judges card or are sending it to a Judges card collector. In 1924 Fred Judge published a book Camera Pictures of London At Night.Review of book in Royal Photographic Society Journal 1925 p40 By June, 1926 the cost of a postcard was 2d. and hand tinted flower cards 4d.Judges Limited, List of Places and Studies The new factory at St. Leonards was opened in 1927. Fred Judge ceased taking his own new negatives from No. 9347 apart from the Buttermere series from No. 9760 to 9841. Some cards taken by Fred Judge were given higher numbers than this as they were not published with other cards taken at the same time. Oliver Butler continued until No. 12971 was taken in 1930 the year when Norman Button was also employed. Between 1930 and 1932 they both continued until No. 15323 was published. Production 1939-1950 and the death of Fred Judge The Second World War saw the cessation of new negatives and the company was in a poor state. Cards without a border were introduced during the war. The 1949 annual report mentions that a new Ford 10 car was not purchased until 1948 to enable Ernest to take new negatives. After the war home production of luxury items such as postcards was severely limited while exports were encouraged. Many Irish cards are found without borders as after the war evidently efforts were made to sell cards to this ‚Äúexport market‚Äù. Fred Judge, on ARP duty, was injured by one of the last HE bombs to fall on Hastings and after a long illness died on 23 February 1950. 1950 onwards Fred‚Äôs daughter Marjorie inherited the company, which was kept going through the quiet years of the 1950s mainly by the efforts of Ernest Bartholomew. The first 200 of the ‚ÄúC‚Äù series are older negatives with colour applied and printed on a rotaprint machine from about 1954. The first postmarked date of a ‚ÄúC‚Äù series card recorded is April, 1957. Again new investment in a German colour printing machine in 1960 and an offset litho machine in 1964 led to a rise in fortunes for the company. The main series of now sepia tone and black and white cards was continued with the colour series running alongside for a number of years. Evidence for this can be seen in the images of 30770 and C350, (30770 and C350 Pony Trekkers Elan Valley) which were clearly both taken on the same date about 1966. Litone black-and-white printing was introduced for some customer preferences in 1957 and eventually black and white replaced the sepia until colour became the norm. Gradually a niche market was carved out with Judges continuing to trade on its past reputation producing high quality cards of the more select tourist locations and increasingly batches of cards to specific order for many unusual organisations but primarily religious locations. Modern cards exist of small villages, country houses, retirement homes etc. Disaster did though almost strike in the early 1980s. The company was purchased by Peter Pugh of Burwood Ltd who were the selling agents for the Francis Frith Collection. However, the failure of an unrelated venture led to the company being placed in the hands of the receiver on 31 January 1984. Disaster though was averted and the company reformed as Judges Postcards Limited with the Wolford Family and former director Ernest C. Bartholomew taking control. Since then the company has developed from a niche producer, continuing producing cards to special order, but now producing larger quantities of cards of larger tourist locations for general sale and also developing cards of general interest such as the Thomas the Tank Engine Series. In 1995 postcards were only 30% of the company‚Äôs turnover and the percentage has decreased further since then. Judges have continued to be produced for over 100 years, and have produced about 32,000 main series sepia tone and black and white cards, 800+ London cards, 800+ 4- main series multi-views, 500+ pre main series, 1000+ other non standard and serrated calendar cards, a series of 1,500+ ‚ÄúA‚Äù series black and white modern cards, as well as a continuing series of approaching 40,000 ‚ÄúC‚Äù series colour cards.Stanley Gibbons Postcard Catalogue 3rd Edition 1983 Judges Postcard Study Group A Judges Postcard Study Group, with about 40 members, exists.

It is a not-for profit organization, and according to its statutes, its purpose is to encourage the study and discussion of problems concerning medical law, forensic and legal medicine and ethics, and their possible solution in ways that are beneficial to humanity and advancement of human rights. The aim of the WAML is to promote the study of the consequences in jurisprudence, legislation and ethics of developments in medicine, health care and related sciences. Members of WAML are both individuals holding an academic degree and interested in the field and both local organizations and institutes dealing with medical law,bioethics and health law from different countries in the world.  Medical Law Medical Law concerns the rights and duties of the health professions and is thus directly linked to professional liability and the field of Bioethics. [1] Some consider medical law a scientific discipline closely related to the advancement of health related technology over the last 60 years. Others link this field mainly to malpractice claims. This growing field of academic research is also of very practical nature, as it pertains to real every-day situations in the hospital, in a clinical trial, and in many other health related settings. The development of the field of medical law led to the establishment of Courses on medical law in various law schools, dentistry schools, medical schools, nursing schools etc. Also, some universities now offer LLM and even JSD or PhD specializing in health law and medical law. At same time, many countries have local organizations and associations of medical law.  Structure The Board of Governors (BoG) is a body of representatives from various countries. Each member of the BoG represents a different country and is elected at the General Assembly held during each World Congress. The Council of Presidents (CoP) brings together leaders of national, regional and international organizations to exchange ideas and discuss issues that may prevail in a particular part of the world and for which others may be able to offer solution. The Executive Committee (EC) is leading the association with the President, Vice president, Secretary General and Treasurer World Congresses Since its creation the WAML held 23 World Congresses for Medical Law, in various countries in the world, in 2017 World Congress was in Baku, Azerbaijan for the Golding Anniversary Meeting[3].

Both nations are members of G-20 major economies. According to a 2013 BBC World Service Poll, 65% of Indonesians view the United Kingdom's influence positively, with only 15% expressing a negative view, which makes Indonesia the country with the second most favourable perception of the United Kingdom in Asia after South Korea.2013 World Service Poll BBC History English sailors first reached what is now Indonesia in the 16th century, when Sir Francis Drake reached Moluccas in 1579 on his circum-globe journey. The British East India Company opened a trading post in Bantam on the first voyage in 1601 and imports of pepper from Java were an important part of the Company's trade for twenty years. However, because of heavy competition with the Dutch East India Company, the British trade post in Bantam was closed in 1683. The British shifted their attention to the Indian subcontinent while the Dutch began to establish themselves more firmly in Java and later expanded to most of the Indonesian archipelago. The British established their garrison at Bencoolen in 1685 and in 1714 built Fort Marlborough in the city. They also established a trading post in Riau, others in the region being the Strait Settlements in Penang and Singapore, while the Dutch wrestled the port of Malacca from the Portuguese in 1641. During the Napoleonic Wars in Europe, the Kingdom of Holland and their colonies in East Indies fell to the French Republic. The British launched a military campaign against Dutch and French hold in Java and establishing British rule in Java. From 1811 to 1815, Indonesia was administrated by the British. Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles was appointed as the Lieutenant Governor of Java in 1811-1816. He was an enthusiast of Javanese culture and history that during his administration he led expeditions that discovered Borobudur, Trowulan and other archaeological sites in Java, subsequently writing The History of Java and publishing it in 1817.Sir Thomas Stammford Raffles: The History of Java; Black, Parbury, and Allen for the Hon. East India Company 1817; reprinted in the Cambridge Library Collection, 2010 The British and the Dutch signed the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 which defined the boundary of British and Dutch realms in Southeast Asia and India. The boundaries were later inherited by modern Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. The name \\"Indonesia\\" was first coined in 1850, when George Windsor Earl, an English ethnologist, proposed the terms Indunesians ‚Äî and, his preference, Malayunesians ‚Äî for the inhabitants of the \\"Indian Archipelago or Malayan Archipelago\\". In the same publication, a student of Earl's, James Richardson Logan, used Indonesia as a synonym for the Indian Archipelago. The British ruled the Malay Peninsula (British Malaya) and Northern Borneo, while the Dutch controlled Java, Sumatra, and most of the Indonesian archipelago until the Japanese invasion in 1942. During the aftermath of World War II, the Allied Forces led by the British were involved in warfare with Republican Indonesian soldiers and militia during the Battle of Surabaya in 1945. The Indian troops successfully conquered Surabaya on behalf of the Netherlands, but faced some fierce resistance from Indonesian troops and militias. Again in 1962 the British army and the Indonesian Armed Forces were locked in undeclared warfare in Northern Borneo (Sabah and Sarawak) during the Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation. The Indonesian Sukarno administration was against the British decolonisation initiative on the formation of Malaysia, the amalgamation of the Federation of Malaya (now West Malaysia), Singapore and the crown colony/British protectorates of Sabah and Sarawak (collectively known as British Borneo, now East Malaysia). The British assisted the Malaysian armed forces against Indonesian campaigns and operations on Northern Borneo. With the fall of Sukarno and plagued with internal problems, Indonesia lost their intention to continue the fight and the hostilities ceased. Indonesia finally agreed to the formation of the Malaysian Federation. After the turbulent years of the 1960s, relations between Indonesia and the United Kingdom have been improving ever since. Because of the importance of English as an international language, the Indonesian government has been promoting the education of English as the most important foreign language taught in Indonesian schools since the 1970s. The British Council was established in 1948 in Jakarta to promote British culture in Indonesia through nurturing the core areas: English, arts, education and society. In 1974, Queen Elizabeth II visited Indonesia, and became the first British monarch to make an official visit to the country.https://www.exoticvoyages.com/travel-blog/12-countries-queen- elizabeth-ii-visited-asia/http://soeharto.co/1974-03-18-presiden-soeharto- menerima-ratu-elisabeth-iihttp://baltyra.com/2011/06/03/ratu-elizabeth-ii-dan- indonesia-3-ratu-inggris-pesta-kebun-di-menteng/ In 1989, the Prince and Princess of Wales visited Indonesia. The royal couple visited Sitanala Leprosy Hospital in Tangerang, Taman Mini Indonesia Indah in Jakarta, Kraton Yogyakarta, Borobudur and Bali. The Prince of Wales later revisited Yogyakarta and Borobudur in 2008. In October 2012, Indonesian President Yudhoyono received the prestigious Honorary Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath awarded by Queen Elizabeth II. Cooperation British Prime Minister David Cameron meeting with Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono In 2006, the then British prime minister Tony Blair met with then Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, where they agreed upon \\"the establishment of a regular Indonesia-UK Partnership Forum to be chaired by the Foreign Ministers, to promote strategic dialogue on bilateral, multilateral and global issues\\". The first Indonesia-UK forum was held in 2007, and was chaired by British foreign secretary Margaret Beckett and Indonesian foreign minister Hassan Wirajuda. In March 2010, members of the House of Lords praised Indonesia for their progress in democratising society, media freedom and environmental protection.Ministry of Foreign Affairs - Members of the UK‚Äôs House of Lords praised Indonesia‚Äôs achievements In a meeting with Indonesian MP Hayono Isman, the Lords stated that they wanted to improve the relationship between the two countries. In 2010, the Culture and Tourism Ministry of Indonesia launched a campaign to boost the number of tourists from the UK entering Indonesia. In 2009, 160,000 British tourists had visited Indonesia, and the aim of the campaign was to boost this number to 200,000. Trade and investment Exports of UK goods to Indonesia in 2010 were worth ¬£438.9 million, an increase of 25% over the previous year, whilst imports of goods to the UK from Indonesia saw an increase of 13% to ¬£1.3 billion.

From 1879 to 1888, he served as Attorney General of Kentucky. He was an unsuccessful candidate for Governor of Kentucky in 1891, 1895 and 1899. Early life Parker Watkins Hardin was born in Adair County, Kentucky.McAfee, p. 68 He was the second child of Parker C. and Carolina (Watkins) Hardin. His father was the nephew of Congressman Benjamin Hardin and served in the Kentucky Senate from 1840 to 1848.McAfee, p. 71 Known to friends as \\"P. Wat,\\" \\"Watt,\\" \\"P. W.,\\" \\"Parker,\\" and sometimes \\"Polly Wolly\\", the younger Hardin was educated in the schools of Adair County, then studied law with his father.Crocker, p. 404 In December 1864, Hardin married Mary E. Sallee. The couple had four children. The following year, he was admitted to the bar of Columbia, the county seat of Adair County. He formed a law partnership with his brother, Charles A. Hardin, in the city of Harrodsburg, Kentucky.McAfee, p. 72 Political career Hardin's political career began in 1865 when he was elected city attorney for the city of Danville, Kentucky. In 1879, state Democrats nominated him for attorney general.Klotter, p. 163 A polished orator, he stumped for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Luke P. Blackburn when Blackburn became ill during the campaign.Klotter, p. 166 Despite Blackburn's illness, the entire Democratic slate was elected.Klotter, p. 170 Hardin was re-nominated in 1883 on a Democratic slate that included J. Proctor Knott for governor against Republican Thomas Z. Morrow.Klotter, p. 215 Morrow's brother-in-law, William O. Bradley, was one of the Republican Party's strongest speakers, and he vigorously attacked the record of previous Democratic administrations, particularly that of Governor Blackburn.Klotter, p. 218 Hardin defended Blackburn's administration in a speech that drew heavy praise from Louisville Courier-Journal editor Henry Watterson. Watterson reprinted Hardin's entire speech in the Courier-Journal.Klotter, p. 217 Once again, the entire Democratic slate was elected by a large majority. =Gubernatorial election of 1891= Hardin was re-elected as attorney general 1887. In 1891, he was one of four men who sought the Democratic gubernatorial nomination.Klotter, p. 316 The others were ex-Confederate John Y. Brown, Cassius Clay, Jr. (nephew of the noted abolitionist), and Dr. John Daniel Clardy, a member of Kentucky's Farmers' Alliance. In the Democratic nominating convention, Brown led the field with 275 votes to Clay's 264, Clardy's 190, and Hardin's 186.Klotter, p. 317 Clay and Clardy split the votes of the state's agricultural interests, while Hardin and Clardy divided the free silver votes. The vote count changed little over the next nine ballots, although Hardin moved ahead of Clardy. After the tenth ballot, the convention chair announced that the candidate with the fewest votes would be dropped. That turned out to be Clardy, and his delegates split their votes nearly equally among the remaining three candidates. On the next vote, Hardin was dropped. His delegates supported Brown, who won the nomination on the thirteenth ballot. Brown went on to win the governorship over candidates from the Republican, Populist, and Prohibition parties.Klotter, p. 321 =Gubernatorial election of 1895= Democrats entered the 1895 gubernatorial election badly split over the question of free silver.Klotter, p. 348 Party leaders John G. Carlisle, Henry Watterson, and William Lindsay were all advocates of sound money principles. At the party's nominating convention, these leaders succeeded in getting the party to adopt a platform that included a sound money plank. Nevertheless, the delegates chose Hardin, a free silver supporter, as their gubernatorial candidate over Cassius Clay, Jr., a sound money supporter. Historian James C. Klotter attributes the choice of Hardin to the candidate's overwhelming personal popularity. Seeing the split in the Democratic ranks over the money question, Republicans, having never won the governorship of Kentucky before, put forth their strongest candidate, William O. Bradley, to oppose Hardin.Harrison, p. 267 The Populist Party also put forth a strong candidate, Thomas Pettit of Owensboro. The major party candidates agreed to a series of debates across the state.Klotter, p. 351 The first debate was held in Louisville on August 19, 1895. Hardin opened the debate with an attack on the Republican Party for its \\"carpetbagger despotism\\" during Reconstruction. Though pro-Southern oratory had long been a campaign tactic of Democratic candidates, Hardin was shocked by a heckler who cried out \\"The war is over; give us something else.\\" The comment shocked Hardin, and the rest of his performance in the debate was affected.Klotter, p. 353 Even sympathetic newspapers admitted that his usual glowing oratory had failed him. Despite the official party platform in favor of the gold standard, Hardin threw his support to the free silver position early in the race, believing he needed to do so to keep the party's rural agrarians from bolting to the Republicans. The strategy backfired as conservative Democrats abandoned the party. Sitting Democratic governor Brown refused to campaign for Hardin, and the Populist Party also ran Thomas S. Pettit, who siphoned off votes for Hardin. Republican Bradley also gained some Democratic votes from the American Protective Association, a secret fraternal group opposed to Catholics and immigrants.Harrison, p. 268 In the general election, Hardin lost to Bradley 172,436 to 163,524. =Gubernatorial election of 1899= Hardin was among three men who sought the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1899.Tapp, p. 415 The others were former congressman William Johnson Stone and state senator William Goebel. Hardin was the early favorite to win the nomination. He was supported by the powerful Louisville and Nashville (L&N;) Railroad and by Louisville political boss John Henry Whallen.Tapp, p. 416 His free silver views helped him with the state's populist voters, but Stone, from rural western Kentucky, was also courting those voters. Stone had an additional advantage among this group because he was not associated with a large corporation like the L&N.; Goebel primarily had his support among the state's urban areas.Kleber, p. 666 Just prior to the nominating convention, representatives for Goebel and Stone met to negotiate a deal whereby they could overcome the front-runner, Hardin.Tapp, p. 418 Goebel agreed to instruct half of his delegates from Louisville to vote for Stone in exchange for Stone's support of his choice of convention chairman. The two sides further agreed that if their candidate was defeated or withdrew, their delegates would support the other and not Hardin. The convention opened on June 21, 1899 in Louisville's Music Hall. Stone supporter Ollie M. James nominated Judge David B. Redwine for chairman. When Urey Woodson, a Goebel supporter, seconded the nomination, the deal between the two men became apparent to all. Hardin supporters nominated William H. Sweeney of Marion County, but Sweeney was defeated by a vote of 551 to 529.Tapp, p. 419 Hardin incurred a further disadvantage when only four of his supporters were named to the thirteen- member committee on credentials. This committee would decide which delegates would be allowed to vote from delegations that were contested. The following day, the credentials committee issued its report, which shifted 159 votes from Hardin to Goebel and Stone.Tapp, p. 420 Chairman Redwine only allowed uncontested delegations to vote on the committee's report, which was approved 441 to 328. This series of procedural defeats discouraged Hardin, and he announced his withdrawal from the race. As voting began, some Hardin delegates refused to acknowledge his withdrawal and voted for him anyway. When the Louisville delegation voted, they cast all their votes for Goebel instead of splitting them with Stone, as had been agreed earlier by the two men. At the end of the balloting, the vote was 520 for Goebel, 428 for Stone, and 126 for Hardin.Tapp, p. 421 Seeing the collapse of the Stone-Goebel deal, Hardin supporters returned to their candidate on the second ballot, and they were joined by some outraged Stone supporters and even some of Goebel's delegates who were angered by his turnabout. The result of the second ballot was 395 for Stone, 359 for Hardin, and 330 for Goebel. Ten more ballots were taken before the convention adjourned for the day. The voting on the last ballot was 376 for Stone, 365 for Hardin, and 346 for Goebel. The delegates did not convene on June 23 (a Sunday), but gathered to resume voting on Monday, June 24. The hall was packed with delegates and non-delegates; angered by Goebel's tactics and Redwine's biased rulings, both groups sang, shouted, and blew horns to disrupt the proceedings. Redwine attempted to take a roll call vote, but the noise made communication nearly impossible.Tapp, p. 422 Many delegations refused to vote under such conditions. Redwine announced a vote of 352 for Goebel, 261 for Stone, and 67 for Hardin, and declared Goebel the winner because he received a majority of the votes cast. Goebel declined to accept the nomination with anything less than a majority of the delegates present. Unable to proceed further, the convention adjourned for the day. When the delegates gathered on June 25, both Stone and Hardin called for the convention to adjourn sine die, but Redwine ruled the motion out of order. This decision was appealed, but Redwine ruled the appeal out of order. The raucous delegates promised not to disrupt the proceedings and accept the result of the day's voting. Seven more ballots were cast, and the vote stood at 398 for Stone, 355 for Hardin, and 328 for Goebel.Tapp, p. 423 Finally, the delegates adopted a resolution to drop the candidate with the fewest votes after the twenty-fifth ballot. The result of this ballot was 389 for Goebel, 382 for Hardin, and 319 for Stone. Stone was dropped, and on the next ballot, Goebel was nominated by a vote of 561 to 529. Following the convention, Hardin made no comment on Goebel or his nomination by the convention.Hughes, p. 44 Some discontent delegates began calls for a new convention, although there is no evidence that Hardin or Stone directly played any part in the organization of such a convention.Hughes, p. 45 Neither Hardin nor Stone gave Goebel much active support in the governor's race, and the election was won by Republican William S. Taylor.Klotter, p. 77 Later life Hardin died of pneumonia in Richmond, Virginia at the age of 79. He was buried in Frankfort Cemetery in Frankfort, Kentucky.

She specialized in the study of information in modern society; information worlds; information infrastructure; classification and standardization; sociology of science; sociology of work and the history of science, medicine, technology, and communication/information systems. She commonly used the qualitative methods methodology and feminist theory approach. She was also known for developing the concept of boundary objects and for contributions to computer-supported cooperative work . Biography =Life and education= Star grew up in a rural working class area of Rhode Island. Her family was of Jewish, English, and Scottish descent. Starved for philosophy she befriended an ex-nun during high school and eventually obtained a scholarship to Radcliffe College where she began taking philosophy classes. Not fitting in and deterred from taking a Religion degree, Star dropped out, married and moved to Venezuela where she co-founded an organic commune. It was here that Star asked many of the questions that formed the basis of her research. Her work is guided by interests in both technology and feminism, and it was during this time that the women's movement and Kate Millett's Sexual Politics inspired her to ask questions about technology and the effects that both good and bad technology have on oneself and on the world. Star later returned to school and graduated magna cum laude from Radcliffe in 1976 with a degree in Psychology and Social Relations. She then moved to California and began graduate school in the philosophy of education at Stanford University. The program was not the right fit and she pursued her graduate education in sociology at the University of California. She completed her dissertation, under Anselm Strauss, in 1983. She became interested in computer science while studying the decision-making process of the scientific community as a metaphor for artificial intelligence with Carl Hewitt. From 2004 to 2009 she held a position as a professor at the Center for Science, Technology, and Society at Santa Clara University. In 2010, she died in her sleep of unknown causes. At the time, she held the Doreen Boyce Chair at the University of Pittsburgh School of Information Sciences and was authoring the book \\"This is Not a Boundary Object\\" with her husband, Geoffrey Bowker. =Academic work= From 1987 to 1990, Star was an assistant professor at UC Irvine's Department of Information and Computer Science. She taught a variety of subjects including: social analysis of technology and organizations, computers and society, research methods and gender and technology. In 1987-1988 Star held a fellowship at Centre de Sociologie de l‚ÄôInnovation in Paris and worked with Bruno Latour and Michel Callon. They worked on French/American approaches to technology and science. After Irvine, Star held a Senior Lectureship and the Department of Sociology and Social Anthropology at the University of Keele. In 1992, Star and partner Geoff Bowker went to the Graduate School of Library and Information Studies at the University of Illinois until 1999. After leaving the University of Illinois, they moved back to California and into the Department of Communication at the University of California San Diego where they remained until 2004. Star and Bowker moved north in 2004 and worked at Santa Clara University's Center for Science, Technology and Society. In 2009 they moved to the University of Pittsburgh's School of Information Sciences, where Star was awarded the Doreen Boyce Chair. In addition, she has been an invited speaker at many universities and industrial firms, such as: Harvard, MIT and Xerox PARC. She was also co-Editor-in-Chief of Science, Technology, and Human Values and was president of the Society for the Social Studies of Science from 2005-2007. Star has been particularly influential in the area of information infrastructure, frequently noting that although the study of infrastructure often entails examining things that seem commonplace, those everyday items have widespread consequences for humans and human interaction. Star has worked to develop ways of understanding how people communicate about infrastructure, and has helped develop research methods aimed to examine the role infrastructure plays in mediated human activities. But her work extends far beyond the realm of information infrastructure. Star's interest in the connection between technology and lived experience led her to work in a wide array of disciplines, including library sciences, computer sciences, neuroscience, philosophy and women's studies. Boundary objects In the article ‚ÄúInstitutional Ecology, 'Translations' and Boundary Objects: Amateurs and Professionals in Berkeley's Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, 1907-39‚Äù, Star and her co-author Griesemer introduce the concept of boundary objects. In this article, Star and Griesemer analyze the formative years of the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology by expanding the model of interessement developed by Latour and Callon, to form their concept of boundary objects. Star and Griesmer initially defined boundary objects as ‚Äúobjects which are both plastic enough to adapt to local needs and the constraints of the several parties employing them, yet robust enough to maintain a common identity across sites...The objects may by abstract or concrete.‚Äù For the purpose of this article, Star and Griesmer defined four kinds of boundary objects: ‚Äúrepositories, ideal types, coincident boundaries and standardized forms,‚Äù however Star later commented that she never intended this to be a comprehensive list; rather she imagined the article as starting ‚Äúa kind of catalog of some of the characteristics of boundary objects‚Äù.

He attended Carleton College for a Bachelor of Arts (Physics) and then Carnegie Mellon University for an M.S. as well as a Ph.D in Computer Science, which he earned in 1982 under the guidance of William Allan Wulf. Snodgrass is a Professor of Computer Science at the University of Arizona.http://www.cs.arizona.edu/people/rts/ He has been an ACM Fellow since 1999. Currently, he is a member of the Advisory Board of ACM SIGMOD, of the ACM History Committee, and of the Editorial Board of ACM Ubiquity. He is married to Merrie Brucks, the Robert and Kathleen Eckert Professor of Marketing at the Eller College of Management. Work Snodgrass and his doctoral student originated the concept of valid time and transaction time.Richard T. Snodgrass and Ilsoo Ahn, \\"Temporal Databases,\\" IEEE Computer 19(9), September, 1986, pp. 35‚Äì42. As of December 2011, ISO/IEC 9075, Database Language SQL:2011 Part 2: SQL/Foundation included clauses in table definitions to define \\"application-time period tables\\" (valid-time tables) and \\"system-versioned tables\\" (transaction-time tables). TSQL2, a temporal extension to the SQL-92 language standard, was designed by the TSQL2 committee, which was formed in July, 1993. Snodgrass chaired the TSQL2 language design committee. The committee produced a preliminary language specification the following January, which appeared in the March 1994 ACM SIGMOD Record. Various members of the temporal database research community have worked to transfer some of the constructs and insights of TSQL2 into SQL3, termed SQL/Temporal. Snodgrass initiated SQL/Temporal part of the SQL3 draft standard. SQL/Temporal has been partially implemented in Oracle, Teradata version 14, and IBM DB2 10. Snodgrass along with Christian Jensen co- chairs TimeCenter, an international center for the support of temporal database applications on traditional and emerging DBMS technologies. The center has published more than 90 articles since 1997, many of which have been accepted in leading computer science journals. ACM Activities Snodgrass has worked continuously as a volunteer for Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) since the mid-90s. Previously, he has chaired the ACM Publications Board and the ACM History Committee and has served on ACM Council. He has chaired the ACM SIGMOD Special Interest Group on Management of Data from 1997-2001. In 2001-07, he was Editor-in-Chief of the ACM Transactions on Database Systems. Snodgrass presented to the ACM Council a proposal for \\"a new ACM service, the ACM Computing Portal,\\" a web-based repository of bibliographic information of all the computing literature. The proposal arrived at a ballpark figure of one million items that captured the entire history of computing, from roughly 1940 to 2000. The ACM Portal, also called the ACM Guide, was released to the public on May 21, 2003. As the chair of the ACM Publications Board, Snodgrass developed a strategic vision for the Association for Computing Machinery to become the preferred publisher for computer science and proposed a far-ranging policy that recognizes the rights and responsibilities of readers, authors, reviewers, editors and libraries.

Most tornadoes form in the U.S., although some events may take place internationally. Tornado statistics for older years like this often appear significantly lower than modern years due to fewer reports or confirmed tornadoes, however by the 1990s tornado statistics were coming closer to the numbers we see today. Synopsis The 1997 tornado season was largely defined by two tornado events. The first was a major outbreak on March 1 that resulted in 27 fatalities, 25 of which were in Arkansas. The second was a brutal, slow- moving F5 twister that struck the small town of Jarrell, Texas on May 27 killing 27 people and leaving behind some of the most extreme tornado damage ever seen. Events Confirmed tornado total for the entire year 1997 in the United States. January There were 70 tornadoes confirmed in the US in January. =January 24‚Äì25= A tornado outbreak in January produced 16 tornadoes in the Deep South. Damage from the tornadoes totaled around $16.771 million and 43 people were injured. An F2 tornado struck Tuscaloosa, Alabama on January 24, resulting in the first tornado fatality of the year. The tornado also injured 10 others and damaged up to 100 structures. February There were 23 tornadoes confirmed in the US in February. =February 28-March 1= A major tornado outbreak struck portions of the central and southern United States on March 1, with the initial activity beginning on February 28. Affecting areas mostly from Arkansas to Kentucky, the two-day outbreak produced 39 tornadoes and killed at least 27 people including 25 in Arkansas alone with one death in each Mississippi and Tennessee. This was Arkansas' deadliest tornado outbreak since May 15, 1968, where 34 were killed in Jonesboro. Over 400 others were injured during this event, which was about 45% of the yearly average of tornado-related injuries in the United States. March There were 102 tornadoes confirmed in the US in March. April There were 114 tornadoes confirmed in the US in April. May There were 225 tornadoes confirmed in the US in May. =May 25‚Äì26= A two-day tornado outbreak struck Oklahoma, Texas, and Kansas. F2 tornadoes struck Perth, Kansas, and Duncan, Oklahoma. A stovepipe tornado touched down near the Red River. On May 26, several intense tornadoes struck Oklahoma including a wedge tornado near Preston and another near Beggs. =May 12= A highly visible F1 tornado moved directly through Downtown Miami, Florida. The tornado is remembered not so much for its minor damage, but for its haunting pictures, which made headlines around the world. =May 27= An extremely violent, but unusual tornado outbreak occurred in Central Texas. The F5 tornado that struck the town of Jarrell, Texas killed 27 of the 1,319 residents. The tornado was 3/4 of a mile (1.2 km) wide and tracked 7.6 miles (12.2 km). Double Creek Estates, a subdivision of Jarrell, was literally wiped off the map with all 38 homes and several mobile homes destroyed. June There were 193 tornadoes confirmed in the US in June. =June 11= A tornado outbreak struck the Texas Panhandle. While most of the tornadoes were weak, rated F0 and F1, a large F3 tornado injured 13 people as it passed between McLean and Shamrock. Several other weak tornadoes touched down across parts of Kansas, Colorado, Nebraska, and South Dakota. July There were 188 tornadoes confirmed in the US in July. =July 2= A localized, but destructive tornado outbreak occurred in the built-up area of Detroit, Michigan. There were 13 tornadoes in total, three of which hit neighborhoods and downtown, striking northern Detroit between I-96 and Eight Mile Road, Hamtramck and Highland Park. The storms killed seven, caused local flooding, and destroyed houses. Five of the fatalities were recorded in Groose Pointe Farms due to straight-line winds of up to 100 mph that blew a gazebo full of people into Lake St. Clair. One tornado formed east of the Detroit River, causing damage in Essex County, Ontario near Windsor. Four tornadoes were rated F3. August There were 84 tornadoes confirmed in the US in August. September There were 32 tornadoes confirmed in the US in September. October There were 100 tornadoes confirmed in the US in October. November There were 25 tornadoes confirmed in the US in November. December There were 12 tornadoes confirmed in the US in December.

Retrieved May 24, 2011, from Kenowa Hills Public Schools: http://khps.org/?q=khps/home The district's name was derived from the names of the two counties it services: Kent and Ottawa counties. The high school and district provide education to students in Marne, Walker, Grand Rapids, Alpine Township, and Comstock Park. Kenowa Hills first opened its doors in 1963 with only one building for a high school and small rooms for the lower grades, at the previously named Berlin High School. Kenowa Hills began growing immediately. In 1992, the Kenowa Hills football team were the Michigan State Championship Runners-Up. By the fall of 1999, Kenowa Hills had built a new high school, which was over double the size of the original high school. The old high school became the middle school for the Kenowa Hills District. Before the 2010‚Äì2011 school year, Kenowa Hills closed Marne Elementary and Fairview Elementary, two of the original school districts.

The Vancouver Festival was a successful transference of the model Mitch Podolak developed in Winnipeg, and led to the pre-eminent growth of the western Canadian folk festivals. He has been a major contributor to festivals further East as well, including Canso, Nova Scotia, and Owen Sound, among others. For a time, Mitch commuted between Victoria, BC and Canso, NS, producing the Inter-Cultural Association of Greater Victoria's FolkFest on the West Coast and working with Troy Greencorn to establish the Stan Rogers Folk Festival on the East Coast. Beyond Folk festivals, Podolak was the co-founder of the Winnipeg International Children‚Äôs Festival, and was the originator of the idea and effort that created the West End Cultural Centre, a major music venue in Winnipeg. In 1976, Podolak founded Barnswallow Records, the label that launched the career of Stan Rogers. More recently, Podolak operated as Executive Producer of Home Routes, North America‚Äôs only house concert circuit at the time. In 2015, he was made a member of the Order of Manitoba, \\"for his contributions to the folk music community, and establishing and promoting music festivals and artistic venues in Manitoba and throughout North America.\\" References External links * The Canadian Encyclopedia * Winnipeg Folk Festival, History * Vancouver Folk Music Festival History Category:1947 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Canadian folk music Category:CBC Radio hosts Category:Members of the Order of Manitoba Category:Canadian Trotskyists ","title":"Mitch Podolak"},{"id":"27118439","text":"Stigmella rhamnicola is a moth of the family Nepticulidae.

Richard Jose promotional version (right, red), and one promoting a woman singer (blue, left). \\"The Blue and the Gray (or A Mother‚Äôs Gift to Her Country)\\" is a song composed by Paul Dresser. It was a sentimental ballad, written in what came to be known as ‚Äúmother-and-home‚Äù style for which Dresser was known. It was first published in 1900 in New York by Howley, Haviland & Co. and was one of the more popular songs published and recorded in the early 1900s. The colors in the title refer to United States Army and Confederate States Army uniforms of the period, respectively. Early performances and recordings Upon its release, \\"The Blue and the Gray\\" was associated with singer Richard Jose, a counter-tenor who worked closely with Dresser and who often sang the song on the vaudeville stage. The song was recorded by Arthur Collins on March 10, 1900 for Berliner Gramophone and again on July 21, 1900 for the Victor Talking Machine Company. It was also recorded several times between 1900 and 1903 by Harry Macdonough for Victor and by a number of artists for Zonophone, including Victor Herbert's Band, Edward Favor and Bert Morphy. Subject The song tells the story of a mother who lost two sons in the American Civil War (at Appomattox and Chickamauga) and, over thirty years later, loses a third son in Cuba during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The song was one of several songs Dresser wrote about the latter war, which ended in 1898. Its lyrics are: A mother's gift to her country's cause is a story yet untold She had three sons, three only sons, each worth his weight in gold She gave them up for the sake of war, while her heart was filled with pain As each went away, she was heard to say, he will never return again One lies down near Appomattax, many miles away Another sleeps at Chickamauga, and they both wore suits of gray 'Mid the strains of \\"Down to Dixie\\", the third was laid away In a trench at Santiago, the Blue and the Gray She's alone tonight, while the stars shine bright, with a heart full of despair On the last great day, I can hear her say, my three boys will be there Perhaps they'll wait, at the heav'nly gates, on guard beside their guns Then the mother true, to the gray and blue, may enter with her sons References External links *Sheet Music Category:1900 songs Category:American songs Category:Songs written by Paul Dresser ","title":"The Blue and the Gray (song)"},{"id":"27118485","text":"Dance on My Grave: a life and a death in four parts, one hundred and seventeen bits, six running reports and two press clippings, with a few jokes, a puzzle or three, some footnotes and a fiasco now and then to help the story along is a 1982 young adult novel by British author Aidan Chambers.

The text accuses Germans as a whole of doing nothing while atrocities were committed. German collective guilt refers to the notion of a collective guilt attributed to Germany and its people for perpetrating the Holocaust and starting World War II. Advocates Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung wrote an influential essay in 1945 about this concept as a psychological phenomenon, in which he asserted that the German people felt a collective guilt (Kollektivschuld) for the atrocities committed by their fellow countrymen, and so introduced the term into German intellectual discourse. Jung said collective guilt was \\"for psychologists a fact, and it will be one of the most important tasks of therapy to bring the Germans to recognize this guilt.\\" After the war, the British and US occupation forces promoted shame and guilt with a publicity campaign, which included posters depicting concentration camps with slogans such as \\"These Atrocities: Your Fault!\\" (Diese Schandtaten: Eure Schuld!). The theologian Martin Niem√∂ller and other churchmen accepted shared guilt in the Stuttgarter Schuldbekenntnis (Stuttgart Declaration of Guilt) of 1945. The philosopher and psychologist Karl Jaspers delivered lectures to students in 1946 which were published under the title The Question of German Guilt. In this published work, Jaspers describes how ‚Äúan acknowledgment of national guilt was a necessary condition for the moral and political rebirth of Germany‚Äù. Additionally, Jaspers believed that no one could escape this collective guilt, and taking responsibility for it might enable the German people to transform their society from its state of collapse into a more highly developed and morally responsible democracy. He believed that those who committed war crimes were morally guilty, and those who tolerated them without resistance were politically guilty, leading to collective guilt for all. The German collective guilt for the events of the Holocaust and beginning of World War II has long been an idea that has been pondered by famous and well-known German politicians and thinkers. In addition to those mentioned previously, German author and philosopher Bernhard Schlink describes how he sometimes feels as if being German is a huge burden due to the country‚Äôs past. According to Schlink, ‚Äúthe reason the European crisis is so agonising for Germany is that the country has been able to retreat from itself by hurling itself into the European project‚Äù. Schlink also believes that ‚Äúthe burden of nationality has very much shaped the way in which Germans view themselves and their responsibilities within Europe‚Äù, and he describes how Germans see themselves as Atlanticists or Europeans rather than as Germans. Schlink sees this existing guilt becoming weaker from generation to generation. Thomas Mann also advocated for collective guilt: Political use The idea that Germans bore collective responsibility for Nazi crimes was used as justification for the expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia and other countries. In today‚Äôs world, Germany has become known for its acceptance of massive numbers of refugees from a number of countries. This acceptance of refugees is still seen in Germany today by some as German collective guilt for World War II, and a need to prove to the world that it is a new and changed country. Gotz Kubitschek, a prominent German publisher, journalist, and far right-wing activist believes that German guilt is a major factor in accepting refugees, and it leaves a lasting impact on German culture.

Joan Goodnick Westenholz suggests it dates to around 2400 BC (ED III). Description The cylinder is inscribed with a Sumerian cuneiform mythological text, found at the site of Nippur in 1889 during excavations conducted by the University of Pennsylvania. The cylinder takes its name from George Barton, who was the first to publish a transcription and translation of the text in 1918 in \\"Miscellaneous Babylonian Inscriptions\\".George Aaron Barton, Miscellaneous Babylonian Inscriptions (Yale University Press, 1918). It is also referred to as University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, Catalogue of the Babylonian Section (CBS) number 8383. Samuel Noah Kramer referred to it as The Nippur Cylinder and suggested it may date as far back as 2500 BC. The cylinder dates to the Old Babylonian period, but Falkenstein (1951) surmises that the composition was written in Archaic, pre-Ur III cuneiform, likely dating to the Akkad dynasty (c. 2300 BC). He concludes a non-written literary history that was characterised and repeated in future texts.Bendt Alster, \\"On the Earliest Sumerian Literary Tradition,\\" Journal of Cuneiform Studies 28 (1976) 109-126. Jan van Dijk concurs with this suggestion that it is a copy of a far older story predating neo-Sumerian times. Content The most recent edition was published by Bendt Alster and Aage Westenholz in 1994.Bendt Alster and Aage Westenholz, \\"The Barton Cylinder,\\" Acta Sumeriologica 16 (1994) 15-46. Jeremy Black calls the work \\"a beautiful example of Early Dynastic calligraphy\\" and discussed the text \\"where primeval cosmic events are imagined.\\" Along with Peeter Espak, he notes that Nippur is pre-existing before creation when heaven and earth separated.Espak, Peeter. The god Enki in Sumerian Royal Ideology and Mythology, Tartu University Press, 2010 Nippur, he suggests is transfigured by the mythological events into both a \\"scene of a mythic drama\\" and a real place, indicating \\"the location becomes a metaphor.\\" Black details the beginning of the myth: \\"Those days were indeed faraway days. Those nights were indeed faraway nights. Those years were indeed faraway years. The storm roared, the lights flashed. In the sacred area of Nibru (Nippur), the storm roared, the lights flashed. Heaven talked with Earth, Earth talked with Heaven.\\" The content of the text deals with Ninhursag, described by Bendt and Westenholz as the \\"older sister of Enlil.\\" The first part of the myth deals with the description of the sanctuary of Nippur, detailing a sacred marriage between An and Ninhursag during which heaven and earth touch. Piotr Michalowski says that in the second part of the text \\"we learn that someone, perhaps Enki, made love to the mother goddess, Ninhursag, the sister of Enlil and planted the seed of seven (twins of) deities in her midst.\\" The Alster and Westenholz translation reads: \\"Enlil's older sister / with Ninhursag / he had intercourse / he kissed her / the semen of seven twins / he planted in her womb\\" Peeter Espak clarifies the text gives no proof of Enki's involvement, however he notes \\"the motive described here seems to be similar enough to the intercourse conducted by Enki in the later myth \\"Enki and Ninhursag\\" for suggesting the same parties acting also in the Old-Sumerian myth.\\"Espak, Peeter., Ancient Near Eastern Gods Ea and Enki; Diachronical analysis of texts and images from the earliest sources to the neo-sumerian period, Masters thesis for Tartu University, Faculty of Theology, Chair for Ancient Near Eastern Studies, 2006. Barton's translation and discussion Barton's original translation and commentary suggested a primitive sense of religion where \\"chief among these spirits were gods, who, however capricious, were the givers of vegetation and life.\\" He discusses the text as a series of entreatments and appeals to the various provider and protector gods and goddesses, such as Enlil, in lines such as \\"O divine lord, protect the little habitation.\\" Barton suggests that several concepts within the text were later recycled in the much later biblical Book of Genesis. He describes Ninhursag in terms of a snake goddess who creates enchantments, incantations, and oils, to protect from demons, saying: \\"Her counsels strengthen the wise divinity of An\\", a statement which reveals a point of view similar to that of Genesis 3, () 'Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field.\\" Barton also finds reference to the tree of life in the text, from which he claimed: \\"As it stands the passage seems to imply a knowledge on the part of the Babylonians of a story kindred to that of Genesis (). However, in the absence of context one cannot build on this.\\" Finding yet another parallel with Genesis, Barton mentions that \\"The Tigris and Euphrates are twice spoken of as holy rivers - and the 'mighty abyss' (or 'well of the mighty abyss') is appealed-to for protection.\\" His translation reads: \\"The holy Tigris, the holy Euphrates / the holy sceptre of Enlil / establish Kharsag.\\" See also *Debate between sheep and grain *Debate between Winter and Summer *Enlil and Ninlil *Old Babylonian oracle *Self-praise of Shulgi (Shulgi D) *Kesh temple hymn *Hymn to Enlil *Lament for Ur *Sumerian creation myth *Sumerian religion *Sumerian literature Notes Further reading * Alster, Bendt. 1974. \\"On the Interpretation of the Sumerian Myth 'Inanna and Enki'\\".

Biography Tatzates belonged to the noble Armenian Andzevatsi family. Probably in the 750s, he came to the Byzantine Empire and entered the service of Emperor Constantine V (r. 741‚Äì775)... Under Constantine V, he reportedly fought against the Bulgars, and achieved the position of strategos (general and governor of a theme) by circa 760. It is not known which themes he commanded, but by 776 he led the Bucellarian Theme.. In the same year, he led his army in a successful expedition against the Arabs, reaching Samosata. In 778, he took part in a successful large-scale expedition against Germanikeia under the overall command of Michael Lachanodrakon, and in 781 he fought, again under Lachanodrakon, in the Byzantine victory at Caesarea over an Arab invasion led by 'Abd al-Kabir.. In 782, the Abbasid Caliph's son, Harun al-Rashid (Caliph in 786‚Äì809), campaigned against the Byzantine Empire and invaded Asia Minor. The Byzantines, under the eunuch logothete Staurakios, managed to cut off Harun's return and encircle his army. Tatzates chose this moment to defect to Harun with many of his men. His defection, however, was kept secret for a while, allowing Harun to seize the Byzantine envoys, Staurakios among them, who had come to negotiate a truce. The Abbasid commander was thus able to dictate harsh terms to Empress-regent Irene of Athens.. The reasons for this action are not fully clear. Theophanes the Confessor cites his hatred for Irene's favourite Staurakios, while the Armenian historian Ghevond Yerets, more plausibly, suggests that he lost favour at court and feared his imminent replacement as part of Irene's policy of removing Constantine V's staunchly iconoclast generals from power.. Theophanes also records that in his defection, Tatzates left behind his wife and all his property, and that they joined him only later, when peace was signed; Armenian sources, however, report that he took them with him when he defected. Harun appointed Tatzates as governor of Arminiya (the Transcaucasian principalities). He was killed during a campaign against the Khazars in 785.

It is a set of formulations for solving statistical problems involved in linear regression, including variants for ordinary (unweighted), weighted, and generalized (correlated) residuals. Numerical methods for linear least squares include inverting the matrix of the normal equations and orthogonal decomposition methods. Main formulations The three main linear least squares formulations are: {{unordered list 1= Ordinary least squares (OLS) is the most common estimator. OLS estimates are commonly used to analyze both experimental and observational data. The OLS method minimizes the sum of squared residuals, and leads to a closed-form expression for the estimated value of the unknown parameter vector Œ≤: : \\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta} = (\\\\mathbf{X}^\\\\mathsf{T}\\\\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\\\mathbf{X}^\\\\mathsf{T} \\\\mathbf{y}, where \\\\mathbf{y} is a vector whose ith element is the ith observation of the dependent variable, and \\\\mathbf{X} is a matrix whose ij element is the ith observation of the jth independent variable. (Note: (\\\\mathbf{X}^\\\\mathsf{T}\\\\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\\\mathbf{X}^\\\\mathsf{T} is the Moore‚ÄìPenrose inverse.) The estimator is unbiased and consistent if the errors have finite variance and are uncorrelated with the regressors: : \\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\,\\\\mathbf{x}_i\\\\varepsilon_i\\\\,] = 0, where \\\\mathbf{x}_i is the transpose of row i of the matrix \\\\mathbf{X}. It is also efficient under the assumption that the errors have finite variance and are homoscedastic, meaning that E[Œµi2xi] does not depend on i. The condition that the errors are uncorrelated with the regressors will generally be satisfied in an experiment, but in the case of observational data, it is difficult to exclude the possibility of an omitted covariate z that is related to both the observed covariates and the response variable. The existence of such a covariate will generally lead to a correlation between the regressors and the response variable, and hence to an inconsistent estimator of Œ≤. The condition of homoscedasticity can fail with either experimental or observational data. If the goal is either inference or predictive modeling, the performance of OLS estimates can be poor if multicollinearity is present, unless the sample size is large. 2= Weighted least squares (WLS) are used when heteroscedasticity is present in the error terms of the model. 3= Generalized least squares (GLS) is an extension of the OLS method, that allows efficient estimation of Œ≤ when either heteroscedasticity, or correlations, or both are present among the error terms of the model, as long as the form of heteroscedasticity and correlation is known independently of the data. To handle heteroscedasticity when the error terms are uncorrelated with each other, GLS minimizes a weighted analogue to the sum of squared residuals from OLS regression, where the weight for the ith case is inversely proportional to var(Œµi). This special case of GLS is called \\"weighted least squares\\". The GLS solution to estimation problem is : \\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta} = (\\\\mathbf{X}^\\\\mathsf{T} \\\\boldsymbol\\\\Omega^{-1} \\\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\\\mathbf{X}^\\\\mathsf{T}\\\\boldsymbol\\\\Omega^{-1}\\\\mathbf{y}, where Œ© is the covariance matrix of the errors. GLS can be viewed as applying a linear transformation to the data so that the assumptions of OLS are met for the transformed data. For GLS to be applied, the covariance structure of the errors must be known up to a multiplicative constant. }} Alternative formulations Other formulations include: {{unordered list 4= Iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) is used when heteroscedasticity, or correlations, or both are present among the error terms of the model, but where little is known about the covariance structure of the errors independently of the data. In the first iteration, OLS, or GLS with a provisional covariance structure is carried out, and the residuals are obtained from the fit. Based on the residuals, an improved estimate of the covariance structure of the errors can usually be obtained. A subsequent GLS iteration is then performed using this estimate of the error structure to define the weights. The process can be iterated to convergence, but in many cases, only one iteration is sufficient to achieve an efficient estimate of Œ≤. 5= Instrumental variables regression (IV) can be performed when the regressors are correlated with the errors. In this case, we need the existence of some auxiliary instrumental variables zi such that E[ziŒµi] = 0\\\\. If Z is the matrix of instruments, then the estimator can be given in closed form as : \\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta} = (\\\\mathbf{X}^\\\\mathsf{T}\\\\mathbf{Z}(\\\\mathbf{Z}^\\\\mathsf{T}\\\\mathbf{Z})^{-1}\\\\mathbf{Z}^\\\\mathsf{T}\\\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\\\mathbf{X}^\\\\mathsf{T}\\\\mathbf{Z}(\\\\mathbf{Z}^\\\\mathsf{T}\\\\mathbf{Z})^{-1}\\\\mathbf{Z}^\\\\mathsf{T}\\\\mathbf{y}. Optimal instruments regression is an extension of classical IV regression to the situation where E[Œµi zi] = 0\\\\. 6= Total least squares (TLS) is an approach to least squares estimation of the linear regression model that treats the covariates and response variable in a more geometrically symmetric manner than OLS. It is one approach to handling the \\"errors in variables\\" problem, and is also sometimes used even when the covariates are assumed to be error-free. }} In addition, percentage least squares focuses on reducing percentage errors, which is useful in the field of forecasting or time series analysis. It is also useful in situations where the dependent variable has a wide range without constant variance, as here the larger residuals at the upper end of the range would dominate if OLS were used. When the percentage or relative error is normally distributed, least squares percentage regression provides maximum likelihood estimates. Percentage regression is linked to a multiplicative error model, whereas OLS is linked to models containing an additive error term. In constrained least squares, one is interested in solving a linear least squares problem with an additional constraint on the solution.  Objective function  In OLS (i.e., assuming unweighted observations), the optimal value of the objective function is found by substituting the optimal expression for the coefficient vector: :S=\\\\mathbf y^{\\\\rm T} (\\\\mathbf{I} - \\\\mathbf{H})^{\\\\rm T} (\\\\mathbf{I} - \\\\mathbf{H}) \\\\mathbf y = \\\\mathbf y^{\\\\rm T} (\\\\mathbf{I} - \\\\mathbf{H}) \\\\mathbf y, where \\\\mathbf{H}=\\\\mathbf{X}(\\\\mathbf{X}^\\\\mathsf{T}\\\\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\\\mathbf{X}^\\\\mathsf{T} , the latter equality holding since (\\\\mathbf{I} - \\\\mathbf{H}) is symmetric and idempotent. It can be shown from this that under an appropriate assignment of weights the expected value of S is m ‚àí n. If instead unit weights are assumed, the expected value of S is (m - n)\\\\sigma^2, where \\\\sigma^2 is the variance of each observation. If it is assumed that the residuals belong to a normal distribution, the objective function, being a sum of weighted squared residuals, will belong to a chi-squared (\\\\chi ^2) distribution with m ‚àí n degrees of freedom. Some illustrative percentile values of \\\\chi ^2 are given in the following table. : \\\\begin{array}{rccc} m - n &\\\\chi ^2 _{0.50} &\\\\chi ^2 _{0.95} &\\\\chi ^2 _{0.99}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline 10 & 9.34 &18.3 &23.2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 25 &24.3 &37.7 &44.3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 100 &99.3 &124 &136 \\\\end{array} These values can be used for a statistical criterion as to the goodness of fit. When unit weights are used, the numbers should be divided by the variance of an observation. For WLS, the ordinary objective function above is replaced for a weighted average of residuals. Discussion In statistics and mathematics, linear least squares is an approach to fitting a mathematical or statistical model to data in cases where the idealized value provided by the model for any data point is expressed linearly in terms of the unknown parameters of the model. The resulting fitted model can be used to summarize the data, to predict unobserved values from the same system, and to understand the mechanisms that may underlie the system. Mathematically, linear least squares is the problem of approximately solving an overdetermined system of linear equations A x = b, where b is not an element of the column space of the matrix A. The approximate solution is realized as an exact solution to A x = b', where b' is the projection of b onto the column space of A. The best approximation is then that which minimizes the sum of squared differences between the data values and their corresponding modeled values. The approach is called linear least squares since the assumed function is linear in the parameters to be estimated. Linear least squares problems are convex and have a closed-form solution that is unique, provided that the number of data points used for fitting equals or exceeds the number of unknown parameters, except in special degenerate situations. In contrast, non-linear least squares problems generally must be solved by an iterative procedure, and the problems can be non-convex with multiple optima for the objective function. If prior distributions are available, then even an underdetermined system can be solved using the Bayesian MMSE estimator. In statistics, linear least squares problems correspond to a particularly important type of statistical model called linear regression which arises as a particular form of regression analysis. One basic form of such a model is an ordinary least squares model. The present article concentrates on the mathematical aspects of linear least squares problems, with discussion of the formulation and interpretation of statistical regression models and statistical inferences related to these being dealt with in the articles just mentioned. See outline of regression analysis for an outline of the topic.  Properties  If the experimental errors, \\\\epsilon \\\\,, are uncorrelated, have a mean of zero and a constant variance, \\\\sigma, the Gauss‚ÄìMarkov theorem states that the least-squares estimator, \\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}}, has the minimum variance of all estimators that are linear combinations of the observations. In this sense it is the best, or optimal, estimator of the parameters. Note particularly that this property is independent of the statistical distribution function of the errors. In other words, the distribution function of the errors need not be a normal distribution. However, for some probability distributions, there is no guarantee that the least-squares solution is even possible given the observations; still, in such cases it is the best estimator that is both linear and unbiased. For example, it is easy to show that the arithmetic mean of a set of measurements of a quantity is the least-squares estimator of the value of that quantity. If the conditions of the Gauss‚ÄìMarkov theorem apply, the arithmetic mean is optimal, whatever the distribution of errors of the measurements might be. However, in the case that the experimental errors do belong to a normal distribution, the least-squares estimator is also a maximum likelihood estimator. These properties underpin the use of the method of least squares for all types of data fitting, even when the assumptions are not strictly valid. = Limitations = An assumption underlying the treatment given above is that the independent variable, x, is free of error. In practice, the errors on the measurements of the independent variable are usually much smaller than the errors on the dependent variable and can therefore be ignored. When this is not the case, total least squares or more generally errors-in-variables models, or rigorous least squares, should be used. This can be done by adjusting the weighting scheme to take into account errors on both the dependent and independent variables and then following the standard procedure. In some cases the (weighted) normal equations matrix XTX is ill-conditioned. When fitting polynomials the normal equations matrix is a Vandermonde matrix. Vandermonde matrices become increasingly ill-conditioned as the order of the matrix increases. In these cases, the least squares estimate amplifies the measurement noise and may be grossly inaccurate. Various regularization techniques can be applied in such cases, the most common of which is called ridge regression. If further information about the parameters is known, for example, a range of possible values of \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}}}, then various techniques can be used to increase the stability of the solution. For example, see constrained least squares. Another drawback of the least squares estimator is the fact that the norm of the residuals, \\\\ \\\\mathbf y - X\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}} \\\\ is minimized, whereas in some cases one is truly interested in obtaining small error in the parameter \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}}}, e.g., a small value of \\\\{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}}-\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}}\\\\. However, since the true parameter {\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}} is necessarily unknown, this quantity cannot be directly minimized. If a prior probability on \\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}} is known, then a Bayes estimator can be used to minimize the mean squared error, E \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\ {\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}} - \\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}} \\\\^2 \\\\right\\\\\\\\} . The least squares method is often applied when no prior is known. Surprisingly, when several parameters are being estimated jointly, better estimators can be constructed, an effect known as Stein's phenomenon. For example, if the measurement error is Gaussian, several estimators are known which dominate, or outperform, the least squares technique; the best known of these is the James‚ÄìStein estimator. This is an example of more general shrinkage estimators that have been applied to regression problems. Applications * Polynomial fitting: models are polynomials in an independent variable, x: ** Straight line: f(x, \\\\boldsymbol \\\\beta)=\\\\beta_1 +\\\\beta_2 x. ** Quadratic: f(x, \\\\boldsymbol \\\\beta)=\\\\beta_1 + \\\\beta_2 x +\\\\beta_3 x^2. ** Cubic, quartic and higher polynomials. For regression with high-order polynomials, the use of orthogonal polynomials is recommended. *Numerical smoothing and differentiation -- this is an application of polynomial fitting. *Multinomials in more than one independent variable, including surface fitting *Curve fitting with B-splines *Chemometrics, Calibration curve, Standard addition, Gran plot, analysis of mixtures =Uses in data fitting= The primary application of linear least squares is in data fitting. Given a set of m data points y_1, y_2,\\\\dots, y_m, consisting of experimentally measured values taken at m values x_1, x_2,\\\\dots, x_m of an independent variable (x_i may be scalar or vector quantities), and given a model function y=f(x, \\\\boldsymbol \\\\beta), with \\\\boldsymbol \\\\beta = (\\\\beta_1, \\\\beta_2, \\\\dots, \\\\beta_n), it is desired to find the parameters \\\\beta_j such that the model function \\"best\\" fits the data. In linear least squares, linearity is meant to be with respect to parameters \\\\beta_j, so :f(x, \\\\boldsymbol \\\\beta) = \\\\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\\\beta_j \\\\varphi_j(x). Here, the functions \\\\varphi_j may be nonlinear with respect to the variable x. Ideally, the model function fits the data exactly, so : y_i = f(x_i, \\\\boldsymbol \\\\beta) for all i=1, 2, \\\\dots, m. This is usually not possible in practice, as there are more data points than there are parameters to be determined. The approach chosen then is to find the minimal possible value of the sum of squares of the residuals :r_i(\\\\boldsymbol \\\\beta)= y_i - f(x_i, \\\\boldsymbol \\\\beta),\\\\ (i=1, 2, \\\\dots, m) so to minimize the function :S(\\\\boldsymbol \\\\beta)=\\\\sum_{i=1}^{m}r_i^2(\\\\boldsymbol \\\\beta). After substituting for r_i and then for f, this minimization problem becomes the quadratic minimization problem above with :X_{ij}=\\\\varphi_j(x_i), and the best fit can be found by solving the normal equations.  Example  A plot of the data points (in red), the least squares line of best fit (in blue), and the residuals (in green). As a result of an experiment, four (x, y) data points were obtained, (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 7), and (4, 10) (shown in red in the diagram on the right). We hope to find a line y=\\\\beta_1+\\\\beta_2 x that best fits these four points. In other words, we would like to find the numbers \\\\beta_1 and \\\\beta_2 that approximately solve the overdetermined linear system :\\\\begin{alignat}{3} \\\\beta_1 + 1\\\\beta_2 &&\\\\; = \\\\;&& 6 & \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\beta_1 + 2\\\\beta_2 &&\\\\; = \\\\;&& 5 & \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\beta_1 + 3\\\\beta_2 &&\\\\; = \\\\;&& 7 & \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\beta_1 + 4\\\\beta_2 &&\\\\; = \\\\;&& 10 & \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{alignat} of four equations in two unknowns in some \\"best\\" sense. The residual, at each point, between the curve fit and the data is the difference between the right- and left-hand sides of the equations above. The least squares approach to solving this problem is to try to make the sum of the squares of these residuals as small as possible; that is, to find the minimum of the function : \\\\begin{align}S(\\\\beta_1, \\\\beta_2) = {} & \\\\left[6-(\\\\beta_1+1\\\\beta_2)\\\\right]^2 +\\\\left[5-(\\\\beta_1+2\\\\beta_2) \\\\right]^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ & {} +\\\\left[7-(\\\\beta_1 + 3\\\\beta_2)\\\\right]^2 +\\\\left[10-(\\\\beta_1 + 4\\\\beta_2)\\\\right]^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ = {} & 4\\\\beta_1^2 + 30\\\\beta_2^2 + 20\\\\beta_1\\\\beta_2 - 56\\\\beta_1 - 154\\\\beta_2 + 210 .\\\\end{align} The minimum is determined by calculating the partial derivatives of S(\\\\beta_1, \\\\beta_2) with respect to \\\\beta_1 and \\\\beta_2 and setting them to zero :\\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial \\\\beta_1}=0=8\\\\beta_1 + 20\\\\beta_2 -56 :\\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial \\\\beta_2}=0=20\\\\beta_1 + 60\\\\beta_2 -154. This results in a system of two equations in two unknowns, called the normal equations, which when solved give :\\\\beta_1=3.5 :\\\\beta_2=1.4 and the equation y=3.5+1.4x is the line of best fit. The residuals, that is, the differences between the y values from the observations and the y predicated variables by using the line of best fit, are then found to be 1.1, -1.3, -0.7, and 0.9 (see the diagram on the right). The minimum value of the sum of squares of the residuals is S(3.5, 1.4)=1.1^2+(-1.3)^2+(-0.7)^2+0.9^2=4.2. More generally, one can have n regressors x_j, and a linear model :y = \\\\beta_0 + \\\\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\\\beta_{j} x_{j}. =Using a quadratic model= The result of fitting a quadratic function y=\\\\beta_1+\\\\beta_2x+\\\\beta_3x^2\\\\, (in blue) through a set of data points (x_i, y_i) (in red). In linear least squares the function need not be linear in the argument x, but only in the parameters \\\\beta_j that are determined to give the best fit. Importantly, in \\"linear least squares\\", we are not restricted to using a line as the model as in the above example. For instance, we could have chosen the restricted quadratic model y=\\\\beta_1 x^2. This model is still linear in the \\\\beta_1 parameter, so we can still perform the same analysis, constructing a system of equations from the data points: :\\\\begin{alignat}{2} 6 &&\\\\; = \\\\beta_1 (1)^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 5 &&\\\\; = \\\\beta_1 (2)^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 7 &&\\\\; = \\\\beta_1 (3)^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 10 &&\\\\; = \\\\beta_1 (4)^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{alignat} The partial derivatives with respect to the parameters (this time there is only one) are again computed and set to 0: \\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial \\\\beta_1} = 0 = 708 \\\\beta_1 - 498 and solved \\\\beta_1 = 0.703 leading to the resulting best fit model y = 0.703 x^2.

Introduction In ten contrasting movements, the cantata relates the story of the Bolshevik Revolution and the birth of the Soviet Union, from the battle for the Winter Palace in 1917, through the suffering of 1918 and Lenin's funeral in 1924, to the building of factories and collective farms in the early thirties, and the final consolidation of Stalin's control over the country with his new constitution of 1936. Begun by Prokofiev in 1936 on a generous commission from the All- Union Radio Committee and Prokofiev's friend Boris Gusman, it was finished the following summer. Prokofiev expected it to be part of the celebration of the 20th anniversary of the October Revolution of 1917. Prokofiev is said to have performed the entire piece himself when auditioning the piece for the celebration, both singing the choral parts and playing the piano. Even though he utilized texts for the piece published by Marx, Lenin and Stalin, Prokofiev was not able to win political approval of his gigantic cantata. In fact, Platon Kerzhentsev ripped into Prokofiev, accusing him of \\"...taking texts that belong to the people and setting them to ... incomprehensible music\\". Nevertheless, Prokofiev fought to have his cantata performed, writing numerous letters and attempting to hold rehearsals. Unfortunately, these attempts were in vain. Because it did not receive official approval, Prokofiev was only paid 25% of the commission promised. Upon the premi√®re of \\"Songs of Our Days\\" in 1938, Prokofiev hoped that the success of the piece would \\"soften hard hearts\\". Sadly, the Cantata never received official approval during Prokofiev's lifetime. The cantata was forgotten until 1966, when it finally premiered, being conducted by Kirill Kondrashin. However, the piece suffered from censorship. Stalin had died in 1953, and had been publicly denounced. Through the de-stalinization of the piece, the two movements \\"The Pledge\\" and \\"Constitution\\" were completely removed. Still a third movement, the 9th, \\"Symphony\\", was heavily modified. Having removed the finale of the piece, Kondrashin finished the piece by reprising the second movement, \\"The Philosophers\\". Prokofiev would never get to hear his piece. He died 13 years before the first performance. Previous examples of this type of Communist cantata include Shock Brigade of the World Proletariat (1931‚Äì32) by Alexander Krein and To the Proletariat and Agricultural Symphony (1923) by Alexander Kastalsky. =Movements= # Introduction: \\"A spectre is haunting Europe, the spectre of Communism\\" # Philosophers # Interlude # Marching in Close Ranks # Interlude # Revolution # Victory # The Pledge # Symphony # The Constitution The music's extravagant sound palette combines a full orchestra with typically Russian choral writing, folk instruments and the sounds of marching, gunfire and sirens.

A sequel to the Bionic Commando Rearmed, it features enhancements to protagonist Rad Spencer's bionic arm, which he primarily uses to grapple to and swing from objects. New bionic enhancements include abilities such as hacking data terminals, a powerful uppercut, and firing grenades. The game's plot revolves around a dictator named General Sabio and a missing commander from Spencer's organization, Colonel Brubaker. Spencer and a team of four other bionics are sent to locate Brubaker and his platoon and help them complete their mission of disarming Sabio's missiles. The team's original mission evolves as the bionics, split into three teams, face opposition greater than they have previously faced. Reception from critics was lukewarm. Some critics praised the new gameplay mechanics, while others felt that it was a step down from its predecessor. Gameplay Bionic Commando Rearmed 2 features many of the action gameplay elements from the original Rearmed. The game is played from a 2.5D perspective, with players being able to move horizontally and vertically. The protagonist is equipped with a bionic arm that can be used to grapple onto scenery, allowing the player to ascend or to swing to otherwise unreachable areas. The arm can also be used as a defensive mechanism, allowing the player to grab barrels and enemies and use them as shields, and to repel larger enemies. Rearmed 2 changes traditional mechanics slightly, requiring users to press a button to release the arm from its hold point, allowing players to user their momentum to swing in any desired arc. Bionic Commando Rearmed 2 features an upgrade system which allows protagonist Rad Spencer to equip both passive and combative features to his bionic arm. Challenge rooms return in Rearmed 2, but have been altered to require the use of specific abilities in certain challenges. Rearmed 2 features 24 challenge rooms, which are unlocked in a progressive order rather than a group at a time as seen in Bionic Commando Rearmed. Veteran players who've become accustomed to the glitchy swing mechanics of prior entries will be relieved, or frustrated, to know they'll need new strategies for completing some of the challenge rooms, most notably making use of the spike pits in order to progress. Local cooperative gameplay also returns, with the second player controlling a version of Spencer that resembles the one on the cover of the NES version of Bionic Commando. Rearmed 2 also features new gameplay mechanics. Some of these were first introduced in the 2009 action-adventure game Bionic Commando. These include the ability to jump and maneuver known as Death From Above in which the player slams into the ground upon landing from a fall, causing a shockwave to affect nearby enemies. Once the game is completed players may opt to activate the game's Retro mode which disables the ability to jump. Players can also climb over small obstacles, or onto slightly higher elevations. Entirely new to the series are Components; items and attributes that can be equipped to enhance the player character. Components include a grenade launcher attachment for the bionic arm and a passive heath regeneration ability. The player can upgrade or change Spencer's abilities in the enhancements screen during gameplay. Also, new to the series will be the ability to enter a scanning mode known as Bio Vision. While in this mode players can search for secrets and scan facts about enemies and locales which may help them progress through the game. Absent from Bionic Commando Rearmed 2 are top-down levels, which in its predecessor symbolized an enemy attack while en route to a location. When the game's producer, Rey Jimenez, was asked why they are being excluded, he responded ‚ÄúPeople liked them because they were in the original, but I don‚Äôt remember hearing anyone say that was their favorite part of the game. It doesn‚Äôt have the swinging, you know?‚Äù The game has also linear level progression, without the option to pick and choose the path. Players can, however, be able to return to previous levels, using newly acquired abilities and weaponry, to access areas they were previously unable to, similar to Metroidvania games. Synopsis Bionic Commando Rearmed 2 takes place a few years after Bionic Commando Rearmed and prior to 2009's Bionic Commando. In the game, a dictator named General Sabio from the Papagayan Islands threatens to attack the FSA, protagonist Rad Spencer's organization. The FSA sends Colonel Brubaker to confront the dictator, but Brubaker disappears shortly after arriving. In response, a team of five bionics, including Spencer, are sent to combat the threat and locate Brubaker. The group arrives on the islands via helicopter and divides into three teams, Spencer, being the commander, operates alone while the other teams operate in pairs. En route to Brubaker's last known location Spencer receives a communication from Mag, one of the team leaders, informing him that \\"something huge\\" had attacked them, taken her partner McNamara's bionic arm, and forced them to separate. Spencer instructs the team to regroup at Brubaker's last coordinates. Upon arriving Spencer finds the area in shambles with Brubaker's forces dead. Spencer soon discovers that a large mechanized robot designated GORILLA is responsible for the carnage. After disabling the robot, Spencer contacts FSA headquarters to inform them of the situation and the possible demise of Brubaker. Spencer's commanding officer, Joe Gibson (Super Joe) tells him that Brubaker is indeed alive, as his tracking device is still active. He informs Spencer that he may have been taken captive as his signal appears to be moving quickly across the island. Spencer is again tasked with rescuing Brubaker at all costs and completing his mission. Shortly afterward Spencer finds one of his operatives, Wilcox, dying outside a factory. Wilcox tells him \\"something huge\\" took his bionic legs, killed Hauser, and left him for dead. As Spencer begins to signal for help Wilcox dies. Deep in the factory Spencer confronts GORILLA, disabling it again. He is then contacted by McNamara, one of his remaining team, who struggles to tell Spencer that he must find and disable missiles armed by General Sabio. Upon finding Brubaker's signal, Spencer is knocked unconscious by poison gas while contacting Super Joe. He is placed in a high security prison by Sabio's men, which he promptly escapes. Outside he learns from Mag that Brubaker had actually lost his legs and an arm in the FSA's service. Following a hunch he heads to a nearby facility. Inside he finds Brubaker, equipped with the bionic legs and arm from Spencer's teammates Wilcox and McNamara. He tells Spencer that he has orchestrated a war between the FSA and Sabio's army. In exchange for Sabio's help retrieving and installing the bionic parts Brubaker gave Sabio the coordinates and performance data for all of the FSA missile batteries, giving Sabio the upper hand in the coming war. After a confrontation, the GORILLA robot appears. Brubaker orders it to kill Spencer; however, the robot now sees Brubaker as an \\"extreme bionic\\" and confronts him instead, thus allowing Spencer to escape. Spencer makes his way to Sabio's headquarters in order to disarm the missiles. He tries to convince Sabio of Brubaker's treachery, but is unsuccessful. Defeating Sabio, he boards one of the missiles as it takes off. Spencer disarms several missiles while en route to their target but is unable to disarm the last missile in time. Upon waking from final missile's impact, he is astonished to find that he is alive and that the missile did not explode. He encounters McNamara, who struggles to tell him that he was the one who disabled the final missile. Spencer notices McNamara has equipped the bionic arm of his fallen teammate Hauser in place of his lost arm. As each bionic is synchronized for only one user, the merge drives McNamara insane. Spencer reluctantly battles and defeats the crazed McNamara. In the game's epilogue the player learns that initially the public was grateful for the bionics' service, but soon began to be fearful and distrust the bionics as more details of the conflict were revealed. The bionic program was ordered to be disbanded and all implants removed or disabled. The player also learns that Super Joe placed the weight of the conflict on Spencer, something that would later drive him to his villainous ways in the future. Development thumb240pxThe protagonist, Rad Spencer, received a slight redesign for Rearmed 2 (left) from his original Rearmed design (right). The change was well received by critics. Bionic Commando Rearmed 2 was revealed at Capcom's Captivate 2010 event on April 20, 2010. It was developed using the Diesel engine, which was used on both Rearmed and 2009's Bionic Commando. The protagonist, Rad Spencer, received a visual redesign for the sequel to tie in the years between Rearmed and the 2009 3D game. Spencer is equipped with an updated arm, has changed his hair style, and has grown a mustache. The title originally started development under GRIN, who had developed the previous title. When the company folded four months into development, Fatshark took over, having worked with GRIN previously on other games. Some key employees worked with Fatshark following the closing of GRIN. Simon Viklund, creative director on the first Rearmed was hired as a creative advisor to the Fatshark team. Of his position with Fatshark, Viklund remarked, \\"They were taking over things mid-project and I worked as a creative advisor during the hand-over to tell them what they were looking at.\\" Viklund further stated that the original design for the game involved events beyond the existing plot. \\"I wanted to start off there and end up in a city in the FSA where everyone can see a bionic fighting. [I thought it would be] a nice way to convey that now everyone will see that bionics can't always be controlled.\\" He noted that this would be an event in which the public would notice the dangers of bionics and seek to outlaw them. Cooperative gameplay is again included in the game, though limited to local multiplayer. Producer Ray Jimenez stated that the reason for this was that the developers \\"wanted to concentrate on the actual game itself rather than adding new features to it.\\" The splitscreen gameplay was removed from cooperative gameplay. According to Fatshark's Robert B√§ckstr√∂m the developers found that \\"gameplay became more fun if you played it on the same screen.\\" B√§ckstr√∂m further stated that coop will feature modified gameplay, requiring players to work together to defeat level bosses. Developers added the ability to jump in the game, along with several other abilities from the 2009 3D game Bionic Commando. The developers provided the ability to complete the entire game without ever jumping, which also results in an achievement or trophy. In an interview with Gamereactor, Robert B√§ckstr√∂m stated that although he did not know a definite release date, the developers had completed the game as of December 2010. It was later released in February 2011. Simon Viklund returns as the game's composer for the sequel. The arrangements were created in Buzz, a freeware virtual studio program. Viklund cited games on the Nintendo Entertainment System as influences for Rearmed 2s music, including the Mega Man series, DuckTales, and Gun.Smoke. When asked about the possibility of a commercial release to the game's soundtrack, Viklund states \\"I do encourage those who ask me if there will be a BCR2 soundtrack to contact Capcom. Really, it's up to them.\\" A contest was held from July 16, 2010 to August 11, 2010 allowing fans to remix an 8-bit Bionic Commando track for inclusion in the game. On September 14, 2010 two winners were chosen. Their remixes were included in the music for Bionic Commando Rearmed 2. Regarding the winners' arrangements, Viklund stated \\"What I had to say about the winning submissions was that I think it's a clich√© at this point to bring in the electric guitars on interpretations of old NES songs, and yet it‚Äôs always nice to hear that (or any) clich√© actually done well. Those two guys both did it really well.\\" Reception Bionic Commando Rearmed 2 received \\"mixed\\" reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Most reviews cited it as inferior to its predecessor. Sales for 2011 were low, moving only 8,359 units on Xbox Live Arcade. IGNs Daemon Hatfield gave the game a mediocre score and stated it doesn't feel as special as the original Rearmed. He noted that the ability to jump just makes the game \\"just another platformer.\\" He also warned potential buyers of Rearmed 2 for the PlayStation 3, referencing the requirement that players must sign into the PlayStation Network before starting the game, a form of digital rights management. The reviewer from GameTrailers gave the Xbox 360 version a more favorable review. He cited some improvements to the swinging mechanics, yet pointed out some fans may not appreciate the jump mechanic. Brett Elston of GamesRadar felt that the game seemed to be \\"a scaled-back version\\" of the original Rearmed. He felt the levels were \\"watered down\\" and cited poor frame rate issues. Reviewer Jobert Atienza of 1Up.com stated that \\"In many respects, it's exactly what I would expect from a follow-up: more of the same with minor enhancements. At the same time, it is just more of the same with some enhancements, but Fatshark seemed to be aiming to make the best damn sequel they could...just without rocking the boat too much.\\" GameSpots Tom McShea gave the game a poor review, criticizing unresponsive controls and cheap deaths. Bryan Vore of Game Informer praised the game's varied environments and the new jump mechanics, but noted that some of the boss battles did not make creative use of the bionic arm's abilities like the original Rearmed.

His responsibility for the Diary‚Äîonce dubbed the ‚Äúmost gigantic‚Äù problem of uncertain authorship in American historical writing‚Äîwas carefully concealed and has only recently been established. ‚Äî the Diary appears as an appendix to this volume; Jacques Barzun and Henry F. Graff, The Modern Researcher (Fourth Edition, San Diego: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1985), 135-36. Early life Hurlbert was born in Charleston, South Carolina. His father, Martin Luther Hurlbert, a Unitarian minister and schoolmaster from Massachusetts, resettled in South Carolina in 1812 and lived there for most of the next two decades.William Henry Hurlbert changed the spelling of his family name, apparently on a whim, shortly after he finished college. He became ‚ÄúHurlbert‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúHurlbut‚Äù upon receiving some erroneous ‚Äúvisiting-cards‚Äù from a London stationery store, and deciding that he preferred ‚ÄúHurlbert.‚Äù His own hasty scrawl had been the source of the confusion. Hurlbert obituary, New York World, 7 September 1895. The elder Hurlbut remained a self-conscious Yankee who nonetheless owned slaves. Hurlbert's mother, Margaret Ashburner Morford Hurlbut, his father's second wife, was a native of Princeton, New Jersey. Hurlbert's parents moved to Philadelphia in 1831, where his father founded a successful school.Jeffrey N. Lash, A Politician Turned General: The Civil War Career of Stephen Augustus Hurlbut (Kent, Ohio: Kent State Univ. Press, 2003), 1-10, 25-27. Fragmentary evidence suggests that Hurlbert's childhood was difficult and intense. The gifted son plainly was his father's star pupil, adept in rhetoric, foreign languages, and classical literature. One may surmise that he was pushed to excel. His subsequent decision to change the way he spelled the family name may have distanced him from an overly demanding paterfamilias.Lash, A Politician Turned General, 26, 221n48; B. P., ‚ÄúA Reminiscence of the Hurlberts,‚Äù New York Times Saturday Literary Review, 5 July 1902, p. 453; Charles G. Leland, Memoirs, by Charles Godfrey Leland (Hans Breitman) (New York: D. Appleton, 1893), 73, 80-81, 233-34. Martin Luther Hurlbut died unexpectedly in 1843. William and his mother and sisters promptly returned to South Carolina. There the precocious sixteen-year-old came under the influence of his half brother, Stephen Augustus Hurlbut, an aspiring lawyer and politician who was over a decade William's senior. Stephen‚Äîwho later moved to Illinois, became an ally of Abraham Lincoln‚Äôs, and served as a Union general during the Civil War‚Äîwas attempting in the early 1840s to carve out a niche in Charleston society. He persuaded William to study for the Unitarian ministry.Lash, A Politician Turned General, 26. When Hurlbert enrolled at Harvard College in 1845, he had spent his most recent two years in Charleston and was regarded as a Southerner. He earned an undergraduate degree in 1847 and a divinity degree in 1849. Following college he traveled extensively in Europe. His personal charm, his gifts as a linguist, and his ability of ‚Äúacquiring knowledge as if by magic‚Äù enabled him to pass easily as ‚Äúa Frenchman in France, an Italian in Italy, [and] a Spaniard in Spanish countries.‚ÄùThomas Wentworth Higginson, Cheerful Yesterdays (Boston: Houghton, Mifflin, 1898), 107. He served a brief stint as a Unitarian minister in Salem, Massachusetts, where he was said to be ‚Äúextremely popular and very much admired as a preacher.‚ÄùHurlbert obituary, New York World, 7 September 1895. Career An intellectual and social prodigy, Hurlbert wrote with flair and found that he could make a good living with his pen. For almost thirty years he worked for or edited newspapers. His skill as a wordsmith provided the foundation for his career. His first assignment as a daily journalist was a legendary success. Between 1857 and 1860, he wrote editorials for Henry J. Raymond‚Äôs New York Times. There he promptly displayed ‚Äúthose talents for which he became remarkable‚Äù‚Äî‚Äúquickness of perception, vividness of ideas, brilliancy of style,‚Äù and the ‚Äúgreat art‚Äù of ‚Äúwriting for the press.‚ÄùHurlbert obituary, New York Herald, 7 September 1895. His ‚Äústyle and scholarship‚Äù were easily recognized and instantly ‚Äúattracted attention.‚Äù He was ‚Äúau courant with the transpiring of events abroad and at home;‚Äù he had historical perspective; and he was ‚Äúextremely ready‚Äù with ‚Äúrapid comment‚Äù when writing against a deadline about late-breaking news.Hurlbert obituaries, New York World, 7, 8 September 1895. Although James Gordon Bennett, Sr.‚Äôs New York Herald and Horace Greeley‚Äôs New York Tribune had more readers, the Times too had national perspective and commanded notice. Raymond made Hurlbert his right-hand man and second in command. During this time, Hurlbert also wrote the comic play Americans In Paris, which had a successful premiere at Wallack's Theatre in 1858. Political differences that came to a head during the 1860 presidential campaign forced Raymond and Hurlbert to part ways. Raymond remained a moderate Republican who supported Lincoln. Hurlbert, who feared that the election of a Republican president would create dangerous repercussions in the South, favored Stephen A. Douglas, Lincoln‚Äôs Democratic rival. Hurlbert watched helplessly as the Union unraveled following Lincoln‚Äôs victory. An abortive personal peacemaking expedition led to his incarceration in Richmond, Virginia, the Confederate capital, from July 1861 until August 1862. In 1862 Hurlbert joined the New York World, working directly under Manton Marble, the paper‚Äôs young owner and soon a fast friend. For the next two decades, the most productive of Hurlbert‚Äôs career, he wrote for the World. He, Marble, and two other talented journalists, Ivory Chamberlain and David Goodman Croly, made the World the most influential Democratic newspaper in the city and a kingmaker in national politics.George T. McJimsey, Genteel Partisan: Manton Marble, 1834-1917 (Ames, Iowa: Iowa State Univ. Press, 1971), 95-96, 178-81. Hurlbert‚Äôs rambunctious prose was a key reason for the World‚Äôs success. He brought his forceful, fluid writing style to bear on a wide range of topics‚Äîpolitics, international affairs, history, and literature. In 1869 Eugene Benson. the American painter, published an incisive assessment of Hurlbert‚Äôs writing. In Benson‚Äôs view, Hurlbert had a gift for capturing the cadences of ‚Äúhuman speech.‚Äù His style had ‚Äúsweep and dash.‚Äù His ‚Äúalliterative phrases‚Äù and ‚Äúrich fund of expression‚Äù enabled him to make ‚Äúthe gravest and heaviest‚Äù political subjects come instantly alive. ‚ÄúNo man‚Äôs articles are more invariably recognized,‚Äù Benson noted; Hurlbert's ‚Äúsang froid, audacity, playfulness, and fluency‚Äù stood out. Benson admitted that he disliked Hurlbert's politics: > The historian of the American press will have to say that while the slave > was lifting his shackled hands to the North, and the land was agitated with > a great moral and political question; while the men of justice and > benevolence were sweating with the task of emancipation, and our armies were > in the bleeding shock of battle, the most brilliant talent of the New York > press was used to persifle the liberators of the slave and the chief > saviours of the Republic. With ‚Äúcold irony and princely disdain‚Äù but always in ‚Äúthe best of humor,‚Äù Hurlbert satirized the ‚Äúmoral element‚Äù that occupied such a central position in American and English culture. He directed his ‚Äúsuperb scorn‚Äù at ‚Äúwhat he would call moral mush or moral twaddle.‚Äù Yet Benson confessed that he was hypnotized by Hurlbert's ‚Äúbold touch‚Äù and by the spectacle of a ‚Äúpolished and adroit mind‚Äù in ‚Äúfull play.‚Äù His writing was ‚Äúalways graphic‚Äù and ‚Äúnever prosaic.‚Äù His skill with the pen was matched by ‚Äúthe elegant fluency of his conversation.‚Äù Benson judged him ‚Äúthe only artist among American journalists.‚ÄùEugene Benson, ‚ÄúW. H. Hurlbut,‚Äù The Galaxy (Jan. 1869), 30-34. In 1876 Hurlbert became the World‚Äôs editor-in-chief. He answered to Thomas A. Scott, who hoped that owning a newspaper might improve his chances of getting a federal subsidy for the Texas & Pacific Railroad. Subsequently, Scott sold the World to Jay Gould, who also acquired Scott's interest in the Texas & Pacific.McJimsey, Genteel Partisan, 180-81, 200-1. However talented, Hurlbert was ill-suited to edit a newspaper. His circle of elite friendships and his rarefied aesthetic sensibilities distanced him from the mass public. He did little to make the paper popular. Instead its circulation dwindled and it lost money. In early 1883, Gould threatened to sell the World, but Hurlbert asked for a reprieve while attempting to put it ‚Äúon a paying basis.‚Äù He fired many editors and reporters, but did not succeed for long in staving off the inevitable. A few months later, Joseph Pulitzer bought the World from Gould. Unlike Hurlbert, Pulitzer knew how to attract readers.W. A. Swanberg, Pulitzer (New York: Charles Scribner‚Äôs Sons, 1967), 66-70; Harper‚Äôs Weekly, 19 May 1883, p. 307-8; 18 January 1890, p. 47. The Diary of a Public Man ‚ÄúThe Diary of a Public Man‚Äù was published anonymously in 1879 when Hurlbert was editing the World and at the height of his power and influence. It claimed to offer verbatim accounts of secret conversations between a long-time Washington insider and Stephen A. Douglas, William H. Seward, and Abraham Lincoln himself‚Äîamong others‚Äîin the desperate weeks just before the start of the Civil War. Historians have long been frustrated in pinpointing the Diary's author or determining its authenticity. Frank Maloy Anderson, writing in 1948, concluded that Gilded Age lobbyist Sam Ward (1814‚Äì1884) wrote the Diary, but that its contents were substantially concocted.Frank Maloy Anderson, The Mystery of ‚ÄúA Public Man‚Äù: A Historical Detective Story (Minneapolis: Univ. of Minnesota Press, 1948); see also Kathryn Allamong Jacob, King of the Lobby: The Life and Times of Sam Ward, Man-About-Washington in the Gilded Age (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 2009). But in 2010, historian Daniel W. Crofts reopened the Diary to fresh scrutiny. He believes Hurlbert to be the author, based on striking parallels between the Diary and Hurlbert's distinctive writing style. Crofts also paired with statistician David Holmes to use stylometry, the statistical analysis of literary style, which delivers a verdict that reinforces the case for Hurlbert.Crofts, A Secession Crisis Enigma; David I. Holmes and Daniel W. Crofts, ‚ÄúThe Diary of a Public Man: A Case Study in Traditional and Non-traditional Authorship Attribution,‚Äù Literary and Linguistic Computing (forthcoming, 2010). Crofts notes that the Diary was not a diary. It was instead a memoir, probably written shortly before it appeared in print in 1879. The word ‚ÄúDiary‚Äù was intentionally misleading. But Crofts also contends that the Diary's contents were largely genuine‚Äîaside from its fabricated hocus-pocus regarding a nonexistent diarist. The Diary repeatedly introduces previously concealed information that was corroborated only after its publication. It contains precise details regarding the struggle to shape Lincoln's cabinet, the composition of his inaugural address, and the secret negotiations between Seward and anti-secession leaders in Virginia.Crofts, A Secession Crisis Enigma. The Diary reflected Hurlbert's distinctive outlook, which was neither Northern nor Southern. Sooner than most Americans, he realized that his native South Carolina was on a collision course with New England, where he studied and lived from the mid-1840s to the mid-1850s. Although drawn for a time to the antislavery critique of the South, he had enough affinity with both sides of the sectional conflict to avoid becoming a partisan for either. He sensed that both sides were mutually blind to the potential catastrophe that their antagonism was creating. Hurlbert remained conflicted after the war started. He wanted the Union preserved, but he feared that prolonged fighting would so embitter the two sides as to make reunion impossible. He opposed emancipation on grounds that it would prompt the South to fight longer and harder. When the war finally ended, he favored a rapid restoration of the Southern states to the Union. He never thought the war should have been fought, and he never accepted the idea that it could be justified by its outcome. He thereby swam against the dominant tide of postwar Northern public opinion. His alleged Diary suggested that Northern Democrats, conservative Republicans, and Southern Unionists had acted more responsibly in early 1861 than extreme men on either side, who blindly stumbled into the abyss.Crofts, A Secession Crisis Enigma, 152. Just as Hurlbert was surreptitiously creating the Diary, he also spearheaded the campaign to move a 3,500-year-old obelisk, ‚ÄúCleopatra's Needle,‚Äù from the Egyptian port of Alexandria to New York City's Central Park, where it stands today on Greywecke Knoll, not far from the Metropolitan Museum of Art.Crofts, A Secession Crisis Enigma, 174-79. In differing ways, the Diary and the obelisk each reflected Hurlbert's historical sensibilities. Later life After losing control of the World, Hurlbert lived abroad. He published books on Ireland and France, each of which used the format of a travel diary to offer his opinions on current politics.William Henry Hurlbert, Ireland Under Coercion: The Diary of an American, 2 vols. (Edinburgh: David Douglas, 1888); William Henry Hurlbert, France and the Republic: A Record of Things Seen and Learned in the French Provinces During the ‚ÄúCentennial‚Äù Year 1889 (London and New York: Longmans, Green & Co., 1890). His last years were marred by a humiliating scandal. Hurlbert denied that he had written a sheaf of salacious letters to his London mistress, Gladys Evelyn, but a British court indicted him for perjury in 1891, and Hurlbert fled incognito to Italy, where he died in 1895.Crofts, A Secession Crisis Enigma, 197-202.

Most tornadoes form in the U.S., although some events may take place internationally. Tornado statistics for older years like this often appear significantly lower than modern years due to fewer reports or confirmed tornadoes, however by the 1990s tornado statistics were coming closer to the numbers we see today. Synopsis The 1998 tornado season saw record numbers of tornadoes and also the most fatalities since 1974 (surpassed in 2011). A number of tornado events resulted in large loss of life. In February, a series of tornadoes caused 42 fatalities in Florida. In March, a tornado killed 12 in Georgia. In April an F5 tornado killed 32 in the Birmingham, Alabama area (no stranger to killer tornadoes). By year's end, 130 people had been killed in the United States.

It is sometimes referred as Sports Club of Gujarat Stadium. The stadium holds the honor of hosting the first ever One Day International match played in India. Once a new stadium of the same name came up in Motera in 1982, the Sardar (Vallabhbhai) Patel stadium hasn't been used for international cricket matches. The stadium is one of the home grounds of the Gujarat cricket team that plays in domestic tournament of Ranji Trophy. It is equipped with floodlights for day-and-night games and is a regular venue during Indian domestic cricket season. The Sardar (Vallabhbhai) Patel Stadium is owned by Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. The stadium is situated in the heart of the city. It is mainly used for Cricket, but it has also played host to a number of programs arranged by the Government of Gujarat. History and Development Sardar Patel Stadium in Navrangpura, Ahmedabad In the early 1950s, the Province of Bombay gifted 80000 sq yards of land to the Cricket Club of Ahmedabad (CCA) to construct a grand Cricket Stadium and a Club House. CCA handed over the project as well as the land to the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation at a token price. It was agreed to have a separate management for the Stadium and the Club House and that the original members of the CCA would form a new club, christened The Sports Club of Gujarat Ltd. Sheth Chinubhai Chimanbhai, leading industrialist and former Mayor of Ahmedabad, went out of his way to hire the world-renowned architect Charles Correa to design both the Stadium and the Club House. Charles Correa, a master of modern progressive architecture also happens to be the designer of the Gandhi-Ashram on the banks of Sabarmati River, which is a standing physical manifestation of the Gandhian philosophy. As far as the stadium is concerned, the entire roof of the huge stadium with a seating capacity of 50,000sportsclub is designed to be supported on only one point! A unique cantilever, pillar-less stadium - the very first of its kind in India! Due to unforeseen circumstances, only one wing could be completed. Apart from Sheth Chinubhai Chimanbhai, the other founder members were Narottam K Jhaveri, Martandrai G. Shastri, Jayantilal Chimanlal Kusumgar, Jitendra Jiwanlal Thakore, Hariprasad Keshariprasad Thakore & Ramanlal C Parikh. The seating capacity will go up to about 1,10,000 after The Sardar Patel Cricket Stadium, Ahmedabad, renovation works are complete and venue opens up in 2019. International Cricket The stadium hosted its only ODI Match and first ever played in India on 25 November 1981. The match was played between India and England. The match was reduced to 46 overs. India scored 156 for 7. Dilip Vengsarkar top scored with 46 runs. England replied with 160 for 5 and won the match by five wickets and 13 balls to spare. Mike Gatting and Ian Botham were unbeaten on 47 and 25 respectively. Once a new stadium came up in Motera in 1982, the Sardar (Vallabhbhai) Patel stadium hasn't been used for international cricket matches. The Motera Stadium now hosts all ODI Matches and Test Matches in the city. Indian Cricket League During 2008 season of Indian Cricket League(ICL), the stadium was chosen as one of the venues for the tournament, others venues being Hyderabad, Gurgaon and Panchkula. Prior to the tournament the ICL spent Rs.100 million (Rs.10 crore) for renovation of the stadium and Rs.30-40 million for floodlights, apart from improving the pitch, outfield, and dressing rooms. The stadium hosted 12 matches during the T20 tournament. The stadium was scheduled to host all seven matches of ICL World Series, but the tournament was canceled after 4 matches due to the Mumbai terrorist attacks. Swarnim Gujarat 50,000 Spectators attended the Swarnim Guajarat celebrations at Sardar Patel Stadium in Ahmedabad The stadium played host to Swarnim Gujarat fest, golden jubilee celebrations of the foundation of Gujarat state, on 30 April and 1 May 2010. The dazzling show was put up at the Navrangpura stadium in the city. The stadium was decked up at the cost of Rs 5 crore. The renovation work included construction of public toilets, pathways, drinking water facilities and VIP foyer area inside the stadium. The civic body also made the stadium weather proof. The whole stadium was silicon painted. The transparent silicon paint will provide weather resistance mechanism to the building. In brilliantly synchronised multimedia show that began with fireworks, the story of Gujarat from pre-historic era, through the era of Siddhraj Jaisingh, sultan Ahmed Shah, the landing of Parsis at Sanjan and the separation from Bombay state to become a separate entity in 1960, was narrated before a jam packed crowd at the Sardar Patel stadium. There were at least 20,000 participants from across the country, doing the enactment of the state‚Äôs history based on a film that ran simultaneously. More than 50,000 spectators & VIPs came to the stadium to attend the golden jubilee celebrations of the foundation of Gujarat state. Outside, a huge crowd, including bureaucrats, politicians and other VVIPs, struggled to be a part of the celebrations and got turned away by the security guards, because the stadium was packed far beyond its capacity. As news of the chaos and agitation spread, Chief Minister Narendra Modi apologized and promised that the same programme would be repeated on Sunday for the benefit of those left out. The second day of the celebration also witnessed the same interest in terms of attendance.

In 1971, Ali was head of the Ministry of Information. He visited Washington, D.C., that year during preparations for planning the World Festival of Black Arts and Culture, to be held in Lagos in 1974. Ali was elected in 1979 at the start of the Nigerian Second Republic on the platform of the National Party of Nigeria (NPN). His government was active in constructing roads, housing projects and industries, and opened 16 model farms across the state. He initiated and constructed the five-star Zarand Hotel. He created 43 local governments in the state, which were later abolished after the coup of 31 December 1993 that brought in a new military government. Ali attempted to revive the Bauchi Meat Factory, establishing complementary outfits like the Gubi Dairy Farm, Madangala Sheep Ranch, Galambi Cattle Ranch and Gombe and Takko poultry farms. These enterprises, run by civil servants, were generally not profitable. He also introduced a car loan scheme for mid-level and senior civil servants. When the Buhari government took control, Ali was out of the country on pilgrimage. He traveled to the UK where he died of a heart complication. His body was brought back to Nigeria and buried in his home town of Zaki, according to Islamic rites. Ali's health suffered from the harsh treatment he received in jail and he died shortly after being released.

In addition to golf, the company also serves the Licensed Sports, Corporate and Specialty Retail markets.Antigua Corporate website About page History The genesis of what would later become Antigua was founded by Tom Dooley, a Phoenix area veteran of the golf industry, in 1976 at a private residence (Dooley‚Äôs garage) in Scottsdale, Arizona. A short time later, the first office/warehouse was leased and the company did business under the name Eagle Golf of Scottsdale. It was at this time that the first embroidery machine was purchased and the first sales representative hired to keep up with demand. After a vacation in the late seventies to the British West Indies island of Antigua, Dooley renamed the company in 1979. In a 1996 interview, Dooley, who prior to launching Antigua was a sales rep for another golf product line, cited his dissatisfaction with his former company‚Äôs delivery system as the reason to start his own company. \\"If I didn't deliver, I wanted it to be my fault, not someone else's,\\" he said. \\"It's hard to build a customer base when you can't deliver on time, so it was very important to me to control the ability of the company to deliver or not deliver. It's very important to me to be very honest with a customer if we are unable to deliver ... 99 percent of the customers always will come back if you're honest with them.‚Äù For the first two decades of Antigua, the company continued to grow and moved in and out of several facilities at this time. In 1982, Antigua moved into a facility also located in Scottsdale and rebranded as Antigua Sportswear, as to more closely identify with the product. In 1992, the company once again changed its name to The Antigua Group and by 1998, it now occupied . In October 2001, Antigua relocated to a new facility in Peoria, Arizona where all divisions are housed under one roof. In 1997 Antigua became a wholly owned subsidiary of Antigua Enterprises, Inc. and in April 2003, the controlling interest of Antigua was sold to Ashley NA, LLC, a subsidiary of Sports Direct International. of the United Kingdom. It was at this time that Ron McPherson, first employee of the company and recipient of the PGA of America‚Äôs Ernie Sabayrac Award for contributions to the golf industry, was named President. Markets Antigua began in business serving the golf industry. Antigua has displayed its line at 32 consecutive PGA Merchandise Shows and has been chosen as a vendor partner for Ryder Cup Matches, PGA Championships, Solheim Cups and numerous events on all tours.

(video) Handel / Somervell comparison Musically Arthur Somervell's song is a simple transcription of the original Handel aria ‚Äì with the orchestral parts reduced for piano, one or two slight changes in harmony, and the instrumental ending (postlude) omitted.Georg Friedrich H√§ndel ‚Äì \\"Silent Worship\\" sheet music at Boosey & Hawkes The text is treated quite differently in the two versions: * In the original Italian baroque aria as set by Handel, the first part of the aria uses a single couplet to express a single two-fold thought: \\"I will not say it with my lips, they do not have the courage\\". The words are repeated several times, to emphasize the lack of courage. The second part of the aria expresses a complement to the first, its antithesis ‚Äì twice as many words for half as much music ‚Äì and therefore not repeated: \\"Perhaps, with sparks from yearning eyes, my gaze will speak to reveal how I am consumed by flames\\". The first part of the aria is then repeated, in A‚ÄìB‚ÄìA da capo aria form. sung by countertenor David Walker (video) * Somervell's English adaptation took the basic thought and recast it to suit the aesthetic of a later era. Somervell expanded a two- line description of a static emotional state into a 16-line narrative, in which only a single line is repeated. Even the da capo ‚Äì the reprise of the first part at the end ‚Äì has a new paraphrase of the first text rather than the simple verbatim repetition which the baroque aria uses. Popular culture \\"Silent Worship\\" is featured in the 1996 film adaptation of Jane Austen's novel Emma, where it is sung by Gwyneth Paltrow (as Emma) and Ewan McGregor (as Frank Churchill). Although Somervell's 1928 English adaptation of the 1728 Handel aria was done more than a century after Austen's 1815 novel, the original Italian aria was recorded in Jane Austen's own handwritten songbooks.Emma: Non-soundtrack Music Notes from site on Emma adaptationsJane's Hand: The Jane Austen Songbooks (CD and MP3) In the film, Somervell's piano introduction to the song is shortened. \\"Silent Worship\\" Did you not hear My Lady Go down the garden singing? Blackbird and thrush were silent To hear the alleys ringing. Oh saw you not My Lady Out in the garden there? Shaming the rose and lily For she is twice as fair. Though I am nothing to her Though she must rarely look at me And though I could never woo her I love her till I die. Surely you heard My Lady Go down the garden singing? Silencing all the songbirds And setting the alleys ringing. But surely you see My Lady Out in the garden there, Rivaling the glittering sunshine With a glory of golden hair. \\"Non lo dir√≤ col labbro\\" Allessandro's cavatina in act 1 of Tolomeo: Non lo dir√≤ col labbro Che tanto ardir non ha. Forse con le faville Dell'avide pupille, Per dir come tutt'ardo, Lo sguardo parlera. I will not say it with my lips Which have not that courage. Perhaps the sparks Of my burning eyes, Revealing my passion, My glance will speak.

It was written by Chris Chibnall, who had previously written for Doctor Who and its spin-off series, Torchwood. It is the first episode of a two-part story, the second episode being \\"Cold Blood\\", and features the return of the Silurians, a reptile-like humanoid race last seen in 1984's Warriors of the Deep. In the episode, the Eleventh Doctor‚Äîa time travelling alien played by Matt Smith‚Äîand his companions Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) land in Wales in 2020, where a drilling operation headed by Nasreen Chaudhry (Meera Syal) is drilling deep into the earth and disrupting a civilisation of Silurians who dwell beneath the earth. The Silurians cause holes to open in the earth, one of which consumes Amy. The Doctor and Rory capture one Silurian, Alaya (Neve McIntosh), and the Doctor instructs Rory and a local family to not harm Alaya, as it could spark a war. He then takes Nasreen in the TARDIS to the Silurian civilisation to rescue Amy and kidnapped locals Mo (Alun Raglan) and Elliot (Samuel Davies). Executive producers Steven Moffat and Piers Wenger contacted Chibnall and asked him to write a two-part episode involving Silurians and a drill. Moffat wished to redesign the Silurians and worked together with Chibnall to create the idea of distinguishing prosthetics for their faces. Being in the fourth production block of the series, the episode was filmed in October and November 2009, with location filming in Llanwynno, Wales. McIntosh then returned in the series as a recurrent actress, portraying Madame Vastra, another Silurian character. The episode was watched by 6.49 million viewers on BBC One and BBC HD and received mixed reviews from critics. While some praised the horror, some noted that the story was very simplistic, and critics disagreed about the redesigned Silurians. Plot In the small Welsh hamlet of Cwmtaff in 2020, a driller at a mining operation called Mo is pulled underground after the ground opens during the night shift. The Eleventh Doctor, Amy and Rory land in Cwmtaff instead of their intended destination, Rio de Janeiro. They meet the leader of the operation, Doctor Nasreen Chaudhry, who is studying minerals deep in the earth that have not been seen for over 20 million years. Nasreen is assisted by Mo's father-in-law, Tony Mack. An earth tremor causes the ground to open and sends Tony and Amy falling into it; Tony is rescued but Amy is pulled underground. The Doctor surmises that someone is programming the ground to attack Amy and the others using technology usually seen on jungle planets. The group is soon alerted to the presence of three life forms travelling up the drilling shaft deep below the earth, and they barricade themselves in the church. The Doctor explains Amy's disappearance to Rory and assures him he will get her back. The three beings are discovered to be reptilian humanoids, and in a scuffle, they capture Mo's son Elliot and strike Tony with a venomous forked tongue; the Doctor and Rory subdue one while the other two retreat with Elliot back into the earth. The Doctor realises the beings are a new form of Silurians, and that they have relented in their attack since both sides hold a hostage. The captured Silurian calls herself Alaya; she was awoken by the drill. Alaya believes, as do all Silurians, that the Earth still belongs to them, that the drilling was a form of attack by the humans, and that they will defeat humanity eventually. Tony, suffering from the effects of the venom, says they should dissect Alaya, but the Doctor warns that it would be seen as an act of war. The Doctor decides to travel in the TARDIS down the drilling shaft to talk to the rest of the Silurians and work out a truce; Nasreen accompanies him. Amy awakens to find herself strapped to an examining table, near to where Mo is also ensnared. Mo explains that the Silurians \\"dissected\\" him, awake, and will do the same to Amy. The Doctor and Nasreen arrive underground in the TARDIS. The show ends on a cliffhanger as the Doctor and Nasreen behold an immense Silurian civilisation in the caverns below the earth. Production =Writing and casting= Steven Moffat contacted Chris Chibnall, asking him to return to writing for Doctor Who. Chibnall had previously written the Doctor Who episode \\"42\\" as well as episodes of the spin-off series Torchwood. Moffat and executive producer Piers Wenger gave him the brief of Silurians, a drill, and that it was a two-parter. The Silurians were villains who had previously appeared in the 1970 serial Doctor Who and the Silurians and the 1984 serial Warriors of the Deep. For research, Chibnall read the original novel Doctor Who and the Cave Monsters and watched the original serial, noting the freedom writer Malcolm Hulke took with the novel in things he could not have done in the television format. Chibnall wanted there to be a large Silurian city in contrast to the small human village on the surface. Knowing that the Silurians were not as popular and recurring as other villains, Moffat instructed Chibnall to bring the creatures to a new audience, and Chibnall decided to start out with knowing nothing about them and then introducing them in \\"the most exciting and scary way possible for people who've never seen them before\\". Chibnall also considered bringing back the Silurians' amphibious cousins the Sea Devils, but decided that doing two races of monster was much tougher and the story was \\"so clearly about the Silurians and what the Silurians want\\". Chibnall, having enjoyed when the Doctor and his companion were separated, made the decision for Amy to be absent for most of the episode. Moffat also thought that, at the point in the middle of the series, it was appropriate to show the Doctor behave differently with other people. A deleted scene, parts of which were shown on the accompanying behind-the-scenes show Doctor Who Confidential, was filmed, depicting Amy discussing with the Doctor how she had seen herself with Rory ten years in the future, and if that would really happen. With the absence of Amy, Chibnall thought that Nasreen became a \\"de facto companion\\". Meera Syal, who was cast as Nasreen, had been a fan of the series since childhood and had been trying to secure a role in the show since its revival in 2005 and was pleased when she received it. Syal described her character as \\"a very high-up, innovative geologist\\" who became good friends with the Doctor as the two admired each other's passion. =Filming and effects= Moffat wanted the Silurians to be redesigned and without their former third eye, as Davros also had a third eye and he wanted the Silurians to be \\"completely different\\". They were intended to be a different branch of the same species, and so the original Silurians still existed. Chibnall wrote for the redesigned Silurians to be beautiful and it was intended for the redesign to capture the actors' features and allow them to give stronger performances and differentiate themselves. Chibnall believed that it complemented the theme in the two-parter about how the humans and Silurians were alike and different. Due to the expensive prosthetics needed, extra Silurians wore face masks which prevented the need for every actor portraying a Silurian to receive the facial prosthetics. Chibnall also incorporated a poisonous tongue into the new branch of Silurians. \\"The Hungry Earth\\" and the second part, \\"Cold Blood\\" made up the fourth production block of the series and were filmed in late October and November 2009 in the Upper Boat Studios and Llanwynno, Wales. In an interview, Syal stated that they did the location filming first. The drill itself was automatic and done by computer. For the scene in which Amy is dragged underneath the ground, Gillan stood on boxes and lowered herself into a stone compartment. Two pieces of rubber were at the opening of the compartment which expanded as she lowered herself down. A layer of soil was spread across the rubber; Gillan's ears were taped over to make sure the soil did not enter her ears. Gillan, initially scared at performing the stunt, put some of her fear and claustrophobia into the scene as she expected Amy felt the same way. Broadcast and reception \\"The Hungry Earth\\" was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC One on 22 May 2010 at 6:15 p.m. The time was earlier than usual to make way for the finale of Over the Rainbow, broadcast afterwards. Initial overnight ratings showed that the episode was watched by 4.39 million viewers on BBC One, a 30.8% audience share. Based on this figure, it was the lowest-rated episode since Doctor Who had returned to television in 2005. When final consolidated ratings were calculated, it was shown that the episode was watched by 6.49 million viewers; 6.01 on BBC One and an additional 0.48 million viewers on BBC HD. The episode was the ninth most-watched programme on the week ending Sunday 23 May 2010, and the 20th programme across all channels. The episode also received an Appreciation Index of 86, considered \\"excellent\\". \\"The Hungry Earth\\" was released in Region 2 on DVD and Blu-ray on 2 August 2010 with the episodes \\"Amy's Choice\\" and \\"Cold Blood\\". It was then re-released as part of the Complete Fifth Series boxset on 8 November 2010. =Critical reception= The episode received mixed reviews from critics. Dan Martin, writing for The Guardian, said that the episode set up an \\"interesting quandary\\" but, although many elements were introduced, \\"not a lot actually seems to happen\\". He was also critical of the family members and found he did not care about any of them besides Elliot and Nasreen, and although the scene in which Amy was pulled into the ground was \\"effective and poignant\\", it left a lack of \\"Pond- life\\" in the rest of the episode. However, he did commend the prosthetics department for their redesigned Silurians. Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph was pleased that it \\"didn't disappoint\\" him. He praised the choice to show the Doctor's pacifism and Amy's few but memorable \\"nightmarish\\" scenes. However, he was not favourable to Meera Syal's performance and considered the Silurian's redesign too \\"radical and divorced\\" from their original appearance, most notably the absence of their third eye. Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times gave the episode a positive review, saying that it felt \\"like proper, classic Doctor Who\\" in terms of \\"gripping storytelling, terrific pace, spooky direction, a grand idea...a small-scale Earth setting in the near future, characters worth caring about...plenty of meat for the three leads\\" and \\"a companion in real peril\\". He particularly praised the performances of Syal and Smith. He also enjoyed the Silurian's redesign, saying that the old one \\"would...look ridiculous today\\". Though he \\"missed\\" the old voice from Peter Halliday, he said he adjusted to Neve McIntosh. AOL TV reviewer Brad Trechak was positive towards the comparisons that could be made between conflicts throughout history to the human-Silurian conflict, but called the episode a \\"wasted opportunity\\". He felt that it was \\"more suspense and adventure than horror\\", wishing that it was scarier, and also commented that it was \\"very simplistic\\" and did not re-introduce the Silurians as well as it would have, had they been part of the overall storyline. IGN's Matt Wales rated the episode 8 out of 10, assessing it as a \\"slender but satisfying success\\". He said that the narrative was \\"simplistic\\" without much depth, but that the \\"strong supporting cast\\" and \\"sympathetic characters\\" made it a \\"refreshingly involving tale\\". He also praised Smith's Doctor, who \\"delivered admirably\\" and carried out the show with the absence of Amy. Ian Berriman for SFX magazine gave the episode three out of five stars, mainly displeased with the redesign of the Silurians, although he was positive toward their \\"venomous tongue lash\\" and costume. He also criticised the \\"clunky\\" scripting and questioned some technical aspects. However, he praised the scene of Amy being dragged into the earth, as well as Alaya's hunt for Elliot in the graveyard and the interaction between the Doctor and Elliot.

The building, which dates from 1714, and is Grade II* listed, forms the central focus of Kew Green. The raised churchyard, which is on three sides of the church, has two Grade II* listed monuments ‚Äì the tombs of the artists Johan Zoffany (d. 1816) and Thomas Gainsborough (d. 1788). The French Impressionist painter Camille Pissarro (1830‚Äì1903), who stayed in 1892 at 10 Kew Green, portrayed St Anne's in his painting Church at Kew (1892). Services On Sundays the church usually holds three morning services ‚Äì a Said Eucharist in traditional language, Morning Prayer and a Sung Eucharist. An Evening Prayer is also held. Music The church is used as a venue for concerts, including those of the local orchestra, Kew Sinfonia. History St Anne's Church in the snow Interior of St Anne's Tomb of Thomas Gainsborough Tomb of Johan Zoffany East end of the church. The small domed building is the cenotaph of Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge and his wife Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel Originally built in 1714 on land given by Queen Anne, as a church within the parish of Kingston, St. Anne's Church has been extended several times since, as the settlement of Kew grew with royal patronage. In 1770, King George III undertook to pay for the first extension, designed by Joshua Kirby who, four years later, was buried in the churchyard. The church became a parish church in its own right in 1788. In 1805, a new south aisle, designed by Robert Browne, was added, along with a gallery for the royal family's own use. Under King William IV it was further extended in 1837 by Sir Jeffry Wyattville. A mausoleum designed by the architect Benjamin Ferrey was added in 1851 and an eastern extension, including a dome, in 1882. Further extensions occurred in 1902, 1979 and 1988. The interior of the roof was repainted in 2013. To mark the church's tercentenary in 2014, a new baptismal font was installed. The present parish hall, which is at right angles to the church and incorporates the previous choir vestry, was built in 1978. Its design echoes the materials and forms of the church building. A collection of funerary hatchments honouring deceased royal or noble parishioners is on display in front of the church's gallery, flanking a rare representation of Queen Anne's coat of arms. A hatchment commemorating George III's son, Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover, was hung in the church in 1821. It is now in the collection of the Museum of Richmond. Inside the church are fine memorials, including ones to the Hooker family. Just outside the church walls, on the south side, is the Kew war memorial, in the form of a large stone cross, commemorating the local people who fell in the First and Second World Wars. Their names are listed not on the memorial, but in the church.

Listed at 5' 6\\", 130 lb., Havlish batted and threw right- handed. She was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota.Jean Havlish ‚Äì Biography. All- American Girls Professional Baseball League. Retrieved 2019-04-14.The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League: A Biographical Dictionary ‚Äì W. C. Madden. Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2005. Format: Paperback, 295 pp. Language: English. Brief profile A slick-fielding shortstop, Jean Havlish joined the Fort Wayne Daisies during the last three seasons of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. She posted a modest .218 batting average in 193 games, but provided outstanding defense with a strong and secure throwing arm. After the league disbanded in 1954, Havlish went on to play elite fast-pitch softball and then to compete successfully in bowling for over three decades, leading the WIBC Top Twenty Year Average list for many years. Early life Havlish was one of five siblings of Howard Havlish, a full-time worker for the Great Northern Railroad, and Mary (Sheskern) Havlish, who labored part-time for the Internal Revenue Service. At age eight, Havlish was watching the older girls play when the shortstop got hurt. She was given an opportunity to play, and after that she played all the time. I can't even remember not playing baseball, she recalled in an interview. Havlish added that she started playing baseball in an empty cornfield near her home with all the neighborhood boys. While attending Washington High School, she developed as a multi-talented athlete, playing hockey, football, basketball, baseball and softball and competed in speed skating. She graduated from there to playing organized softball in the playground leagues. The only thing I could not play was tennis, she acknowledged.The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League In 1950, Havlish and her father saw an article in Parade Magazine about the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League and decided that she should try out. Havlish had the opportunity to do a little infield practice with the Racine Belles and received an invitation to a full- scale audition the next year. She was allocated to the Kalamazoo Lassies in 1951 but never heard from them. Eventually, she wound up with the Fort Wayne Daisies in 1952 in a shortstop swap that sent Dottie Schroeder to Kalamazoo. After three tryouts for three different teams, Havlish went back to school and entered the league in 1952 with the Daisies, by then managed by Bill Allington. AAGPBL career Havlish played in only a few games for the Daisies in 1952. In 1953, she struggled at the plate, hitting just .189 (64-for-343), but she excelled in the field preventing runs for a team particularly potent on offense. In the 1953 season, the Daisies outscored their nearest rival by over 100 runs, winning the league title with a 66-39 mark. The explosive bats of Wilma Briggs and the sisters Betty Weaver Foss and Joanne Weaver provided the difference in the league. While Briggs belted a league-lead nine home runs, Joanne led in average (.346) and Betty in runs batted in (81) and stolen bases (80), but Fort Wayne lost for the third consecutive year in the first round, now with the Kalamazoo Lassies, 2-to-1.League History. All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Retrieved 2019-04-14. In the 1953 All-Star Game, played on July 14 at Memorial Park, the Daisies defeated the All-Star team in an 11-inning effort behind Jean Geissinger, who belted a walk-off home run, and Katie Horstman, whose relief pitching silenced an All-Stars potential rally in the 9th inning.All- American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book ‚Äì W.

Havlish improved her offensive and defensive statistics in 1954, when she connected 11 more hits in 67 fewer at-bats for a .254 average (70-for-276), including hitting a home run in three consecutive games. At the field, she committed 18 fewer errors, participated in 14 more double plays, and started a triple play. Notably, she played in 14 fewer games due to an injury, but also had three times as many doubles, 11 more walks and 24 fewer strikeouts (she fanned only 16 times). During what turned out to be the league's final season, Kalamazoo clinched the Championship Title over Fort Wayne, three games to two. After the AAGPBL disbanded in 1954, Havlish was quickly recruited by the elite Minneapolis Comets amateur fast-pitch softball team. As shortstop for the Comets, she traveled twice to the world championships in Connecticut. She later started to play bowling recreationally in a 3M Company league that met in the upstairs of a St. Paul bar owned by Jake Mauer, grandfather of the Minnesota Twins‚Äô catcher Joe Mauer. Bowling career Eventually, Havlish went up against the very best women bowlers in the country. A member of the St. Paul Women's Bowling Association for over 30 years, she participated in 28 state and numerous national amateur competitions, winning the State 600 Tournament four times. She won the singles and all-events titles in the WIBC Championship Tournament in 1964, becoming the first Minnesotan to do so, and was state All Events champion in 1964 and 1968. In addition, Havlish was part of a team that placed third in the WIBC Championship Tournament in Tulsa; won the Singles and All Events in that tournament in Minneapolis, and was on a local championship team that won the All Events in the local tournament twice. She led the WIBC in 20-year average for many years, captured the 600 Club Championship three times, had the high game in the St. Paul Association three times and the high series five times. Havlish posted the high game in the St. Paul Association three times and the high series five times; had the high average in the city nine times and was on the All City team six times, reigning as Queen three times. She also was successful on the pro bowling tour, winning titles in Indianapolis, Kansas City and Fort Smith, and competed in the FIQ Tournament in Winnipeg, where the five-woman team won gold medals and the three-woman team earned bronze medals. She originated the Great Lakes Invitational Tournament (GLIT) in the late 1960s, made the Bowlers Journal first All-American Team in 1969, and had several high games of 299 and sixteen 700s during her bowling career, including a high series of 736, and maintaining an average of 185 or better for at least twenty-five years with a high average of 196. Awards and recognitions Havlish is included in a Women in Baseball permanent display, which was opened in 1988 at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League rather than any individual player. Havlish kept the glove she used at shortstop for the Daisies in her car for many years, because her gas station attendant liked to play catch with her. In 2009, the glove was accepted by the Hall of Fame as part of the AAGPBL memorabilia. In 1992, Havlish, Kay Heim and Nancy Mudge, two other Minnesota residents and former AAGPBL players, were invited to throw out the first pitch in a game Angels- Twins played at the Metrodome. The trio also was honored by the Colorado Silver Bullets all-female baseball team in their 1994 inaugural season, in which they threw out the first ball pitch of a game celebrated in Saint Paul.Colorado Silver Bullets Webpage In 1999, as century and millennium retrospectives abounded in magazines and newspapers, the Minneapolis Star Tribune named Havlish one of the top Minnesota athletes of the millennium,Star Tribune Millenium: Top 100 Sports Figures and Sports Illustrated ranked her 36th among the 50 top Minnesota athletes of the 20th century.Sports Illustrated - 50th Anniversary Additionally, Havlish gained inductions in the Women's International Bowling Congress Hall of Fame in 1987, the Minnesota State Women's Hall of Fame in 1991, the St. Bernard‚Äôs Athletic Hall of Fame in 2007, and is also a member of the Minnesota Sports Hall of Fame since 1987, having the distinction of being the only bowler in this society which is displayed at the Metrodome.Baseball in Fort Wayne Havlish currently lives in Rockville, Minnesota, where she is housekeeper for a priest.

The episode was an hour long and aired at 8:00pm, an hour after a repeat of the first episode with an introduction by William Roache from the soap's outdoor set where last minute preparations for the live episode were under way. The episode was number 4945 in the series and was the first live edition to be broadcast since Episode 17, which aired on 3 February 1961. It was watched by 17 million viewers. The episode is notable for an appearance by Charles, Prince of Wales who visited the show's Manchester based studios earlier in the day and met cast members. Footage of him meeting actress Sue Nicholls was incorporated into the storyline following prior agreement with the Prince's staff, and this is the only part of the episode which was pre-recorded. Scenes for the episode were broadcast live from the Coronation Street outdoor set and the Stage One studio complex next door. The episode charted the events of a single day. However, because transmission was during the hours of darkness all scenes set outdoors appeared near the beginning or end of the programme. Scenes meant to be set during the daytime were studio based. Plot With council workmen set to arrive to begin digging up the Street's cobble stones and replacing them with tarmac, Ken Barlow (William Roache) and Duggie Ferguson (John Bowe) decide to make up a rota so that the Street's entrance will be continuously manned by demonstrators. Vera Duckworth (Liz Dawn) is critical but stable at Weatherfield General, having had an allergic reaction to the antibiotics. Tyrone Dobbs (Alan Halsall) and Maria Sutherland (Samia Ghadie) convince Vera's husband, Jack (Bill Tarmey) to go home and rest, as he has been at Vera's bedside all night. However, when Martin Platt (Sean Wilson) advises them that Jack should not stay away for too long, Tyrone panics and phones Curly Watts (Kevin Kennedy) to ask him to fetch Jack. Curly, who is speaking on the phone in The Kabin is overheard by Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden), who misinterprets the conversation and believes that Vera has died. Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls) brags to Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox) about her upcoming lunch date with Prince Charles, who is visiting Weatherfield to open a new planning office at the Town Hall. Before she leaves, she calls into Roy's Rolls to warn Ken and Duggie that the tarmackers are getting a court injunction meaning the police will be able to remove the demonstrators. Ken is working on getting a preservation order from Northern Heritage but fears this may take too long. Hayley Cropper (Julie Hesmondhalgh) questions her husband, Roy (David Neilson) about their interview with Peter Hartnell, but Roy is more concerned with the demo. At The Rovers Return Inn, Natalie Barnes (Denise Welch) tells Liz McDonald (Beverley Callard) that she will be spending the day with the brewery, who are going to show her around other pubs. Natalie later overhears Liz and Geena Gregory (Jennifer James) express their pity for her situation as a single mother with a pub to run. Duggie tells Natalie about his experiences growing up in a pub, which make her even more worried. Jack reads a letter from Vera aloud to Curly. Jack is moved by Vera's words but tries not to shed tears. In her letter, Vera confesses to an affair which she had before their son, Terry (Nigel Pivaro), was born, which led to her uncertainty over Terry's parenity. Jack tells Curly he knew about the affair, and it ended after he beat up the man concerned - Vera never found out. Jack explains that he knows Terry is his son because he reminds him of the way he used to be. Jack and Curly are joined by Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire), who has been told that Vera has died and come to offer her sympathies. Jack and Curly race to the hospital, where they are relieved to learn that there has been no change in Vera's condition. News of Vera's apparent death spreads to The Rovers, putting a dampener on the spirits of the protesters. Curly and Emily confer and, realising that Norris was the source of the false rumour, confront him. Curly later puts the record straight. Just as everybody celebrates the fact that Vera has not died, Audrey returns from her lunch with Prince Charles and says the tarmackers will arrive soon with a police escort. Eileen Grimshaw (Sue Cleaver) overhears and hatches a plan. Terry arrives at the hospital having heard about Vera. Jack stops him leaving and berates him. Terry breaks down when he sees Vera. As Curly returns, Vera starts to regain consciousness, managing to utter a few words. Terry watches from outside the hospital room. The tarmackers arrive and the police give the demonstrators five minutes to move or they will be arrested. Norris is ready to admit defeat but Ken and Duggie persuade everybody to stay put. Ken manages to stall the police by saying he's waiting for his solicitor, but with the officer's patience wearing thin, the demonstrators still refuse to move. As the police begin manhandling them away, Eileen and Dennis Stringer (Charles Dale) blockade the Street with a convoy of taxis from StreetCars, Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson) knows nothing about the scheme, however, and when he arrives on the scene, he is annoyed when the police threaten to tow the vehicles away. Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) arrives in a taxi as the residents celebrate their brief victory. He is not surprised to find Ken at the centre of things. Peter tells Deirdre Rachid (Anne Kirkbride) and Blanche Hunt (Maggie Jones) that he has left the Navy and that his wife Jessica has left him. He goes for a drink in The Rovers and tries to chat up Linda Baldwin (Jacqueline Pirie), unaware that she is married to Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs), but becomes aware of her identity after making a fool of himself. Natalie, Geena and Liz watch the ITV Evening News on which Sir Trevor McDonald reads an item about Prince Charles' visit to Manchester. Audrey is seen being presented to the Prince at Weatherfield Town Hall. Hayley finally finds the opportunity to speak to Roy. She is distressed that Roy does not see her as a woman, and when he clarifies that he does not think of her in the same way as other women, before going off to join the demonstrators, Hayley writes him a letter, packs her bags and leaves their flat. Ken realises that the preservation order will not arrive in time to save the cobbles. However, Duggie realises that nobody knows what the preservation order looks like, so creates a fake preservation order, which will hopefully fool the police long enough for the real one to arrive. They type it on Ken's laptop before emailing it to Stan Potter, a friend of Duggie's, who prints a hard copy for them. With the cars moved, the police give the tarmackers the go-ahead to start work, but Stan arrives just in time to deliver the fake preservation order. The police are sceptical, but order the tarmackers to pack up for the night. The residents celebrate their victory, jeering at Les Battersby (Bruce Jones) when he tries to join in. Roy reads Hayley's letter and frantically searches for her as the celebrations are under way. Natalie tells Geena she plans to sell The Rovers to a pub chain. Ken leads the demonstrators in a toast to tradition and community. Background The announcement that Coronation Street would air a live episode to celebrate its 40th anniversary was first made by Granada Television in August 2000. Television producers in the United States had recently experimented with live episodes to great success, with a live edition of the hospital drama ER attracting 42 million viewers, and Granada Television believed that a live episode would be an ideal way to celebrate Coronation Street's 40th anniversary (a number of episodes, including the first one on 9 December 1960 had been recorded live). The show's producer, Jane Macnaught, said: \\"It will mean a lot of hard work for the cast and production team involved, but I know it will be an enjoyable and exhilarating experience.\\" At this point few details were available of any potential storyline, but a spokeswoman said that the episode would see one of the characters have a serious health condition, while a couple would be faced with a personal dilemma. Other events to mark the anniversary would include a documentary about the life of actor Bill Roache, who had played the role of Ken Barlow since the soap's inception, and a tribute programme called Forty Years of Coronation Street. On 5 December, it was announced that the Slade singer Noddy Holder would make a cameo appearance in the episode as a character named Stan. The actor John Savident who played Fred Elliott was also due to appear, but was unable to take part following an attack on him in his home by an intruder. It was also reported that because the episode would be aired at night cast members had been rehearsing many of the scenes in the evening as part of their preparations. Cast members did not usually rehearse before recording scenes, but it was reported they had spent forty hours rehearsing for the episode. On 8 December, Prince Charles visited the Granada Studios in Manchester and unveiled a plaque on the set to celebrate the soap's 40th anniversary. The plaque was located on a wall next to the Rovers Return Inn, but would eventually be moved to a green room where cast members relax between scenes. He also met cast members, including the actress Sue Nicholls. Footage of their meeting was later incorporated into the live episode, which showed a news report of Nicholls' character Audrey Roberts being presented to the Prince at the opening of a new planning office at Weatherfield Town Hall. An hour before the 8:00pm episode was due to be aired, ITV showed a repeat of the first episode from 1960. The episode was preceded by an introduction from William Roache, who was on set preparing to take part in the live episode. The live episode itself was preceded by a montage featuring the Coronation Street cast members over which was played the popular song \\"You're Nobody till Somebody Loves You\\". The sequence ended with the caption \\"Coronation Street - Forty Years - Thank You\\". Opening and closing scenes The programme's title sequence was not used at the beginning of the episode. Instead, the opening moment of the first scene was transmitted in black and white with a \\"scratchy film\\" overlay meant to simulate apparent early broadcasts. The first scene showed Sarah Platt telling her brother David to come inside to get ready for school. The end credits of the episode included the caption: \\"With thanks to H.R.H. The Prince of Wales\\".Coronation Street: Episode 4945, ITV, 8 December 2000, 8:00pm DVD releases The Live episode was included in the Golden Anniversary DVD Collection, released by ITV Home Entertainment on 11 October 2010. Also available as part of the Stars of the Street - 50 Years, 50 Classic Characters DVD set released on the same day.

In April 2010, Bill Roache confirmed that ITV would not be airing another live edition. He said; \\"We're not going to do a live episode, we did that in the Millennium year [the show's 40th anniversary], we don't want to do that again.\\" However, on 29 August, actor Keith Duffy said that Coronation Street would air a live episode to celebrate its 50th anniversary, something which was confirmed on 1 September by ITV. The episode was aired on Thursday 9 December as part of a week long celebration of the show's 50th birthday.

Early life In November 1831, the Reverend William Patterson Alexander (1805‚Äì1884) and Mary Ann McKinney Alexander (1810‚Äì1888) arrived in April 1832 as missionaries to the Hawaiian Islands. Samuel Thomas was born October 29, 1836 at the Waioli mission in what is now Hanalei on the northern coast of Kauai island. In 1843 the family moved to the Lahainaluna School, where they became friends with the family of Dwight Baldwin who had arrived in the previous company in 1831. Alexander's education was sporadic; he went to Punahou School for various times between 1841 and 1859 In 1857 he and Frederick S. Lyman (son of missionary David Belden Lyman) went to California in a late wave of the California Gold Rush, but came back empty handed. He then went to Williams College for one year, and then Westfield School in Massachusetts. He followed his father's footsteps and taught at Lahainaluna briefly. In 1863 Alexander became manager of the Waihee sugarcane plantation near Wailuku, hiring Henry Perrine Baldwin (1842‚Äì1911) as assistant. Business and adventure On January 26, 1864 Alexander married Martha Eliza Cooke, daughter of Amos Starr Cooke, one of two former missionary who founded the Castle & Cooke company. Abigail Charlette Baldwin (1847‚Äì1912) married his older brother William DeWitt Alexander (1833‚Äì1913) in 1861. William was a teacher and then president of Punahou School. In 1869 his sister Emily Whitney Alexander married Henry Perrine Baldwin. In 1870 he formed the PƒÅia plantation under the name Samuel T Alexander & Co. With Baldwin, he purchased 561 acres (2.3 km¬≤) between PƒÅia and Makawao, where they cultivated sugarcane. In 1871 Alexander managed the Ha ªik≈´ sugar mill which had been constructed in 1861 by Castle & Cooke. The Reciprocity Treaty of 1875 removed tariffs on sugar exported to the United States. But to raise their production a steady supply of water was needed for the semi-arid dry forests of PƒÅia. Alexander realized that rain was plentiful miles away in the rainforests on the windward slopes of HaleakalƒÅ mountain. Alexander proposed a irrigation aqueduct that diverted water from that part of HaleakalƒÅ to their plantation. Alexander knew about irrigation systems used since ancient Hawaii while he was at Lahainaluna, but this was on a much larger scale. He negotiated a lease of water rights from King KalƒÅkaua and raised financing from other partners. It was initially a 20-year lease for $100 per year. His brother James did a survey. Work started on the aqueduct in 1876 and was completed two years later in 1878 (at over three times the estimated cost), just before a deadline in the lease. In 1883 the Alexander family moved to Oakland, California, to get medical attention for his father, who died there August 13, 1884. After completion of the aqueduct, the company grew by selling water to adjacent plantations, and was eventually renamed Alexander & Baldwin Plantation. In 1884 Alexander arranged for the partners to buy the small American Sugar Refinery in California, and later organized a group of Hawaiian planters called the Sugar Factors which became the California and Hawaiian Sugar Company (C&H;). Between 1872 and 1900, the company took over more land and sugar mill operations. In 1898, Alexander and Baldwin purchased a controlling interest in one of its rival companies, Hawaiian Commercial & Sugar Company (HC&S;) from Claus Spreckels. By 1899, the company bought two of Maui‚Äôs railroad lines. On June 30, 1900, Alexander & Baldwin, Ltd. was incorporated. Alexander left running the company to others, and became an adventurer. In 1893 he bicycled through Europe. He traveled through the Pacific Ocean in 1896, including the Marquesas Islands where his parents traveled before he was born, China, and Japan. He also had a winter home on Maui called Olinda, and a summer home in Shasta County, California. Legacy Alexander & Baldwin became one of the \\"Big Five\\" corporations that dominated the economy of the Territory of Hawaii. A&B; is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and was added as part of the Dow Jones Transportation Average after purchasing Matson Navigation Company. It continues to produce sugar and founded a museum on Maui in 1980 which is now an independent non-profit organization. Alexander had two sons and three daughters. Wallace M. Alexander went on to serve as chairman of Alexander & Baldwin and as a trustee of Stanford University, as director of the California and Hawaiian Sugar Company and Pacific Gas and Electric Company, and died November 22, 1939. Wallace's daughter Martha Alexander Gerbode (1909‚Äì1971) became an environmental activist and philanthropist. Alexander's daughters were Juliette Alexander (1865‚Äì1948), Annie Montague Alexander (1867‚Äì1950), and Martha Mabel Alexander (1878‚Äì1970). A second son, Clarence Chambers, died young (1880‚Äì1884). In 1904, Samuel Alexander arranged a trip with daughter Annie and Thomas L. Gulick, son of another missionary Peter Johnson Gulick (1796‚Äì1877). The men were looking forward to hunting big game in Africa, while Annie was developing an interest in paleontology. Gulick became ill and died August 15, 1904 in Kijabe, Kenya. On September 8 the Alexanders reached Victoria Falls. The next day they crossed the Zambezi river and climbed down the canyon for a better view. While posing for a picture, Samuel was hit by a boulder tossed down from workers above that crushed his foot. He was buried at the Old Drift cemetery after dying a day later on September 10, 1904. (name is Samuel Taylor Alexander on memorial) Annie continued to go on expeditions through her 80th birthday, and founded two museums. Samuel also has a monument in Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland where other family members are buried. Martha Mabel married John Thomas Waterhouse (1873‚Äì1945) in 1900. The swimming pool at Punahou School was named for their daughter Elizabeth Pinder Waterhouse (1903‚Äì1920) who was a student there when she died. The track field is named for Samuel.

As a journeyman cornerback, Butler has been a member of eight NFL teams, including the Arizona Cardinals, Washington Redskins, Buffalo Bills, San Diego Chargers, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Seattle Seahawks and Detroit Lions. He has also been a member of the CFL's Saskatchewan Roughriders and BC Lions. Early years Butler was born in Asheville, North Carolina, and attended Asheville High School, where he led the Cougars to the 2005 divisional championship. Rated a four-star cornerback by recruiting services like Scout.com and Rivals.com, he chose to attend Clemson University over other schools such as the University of South Carolina, University of North Carolina, and Virginia Tech. College career As a true freshman, Butler received playing time as a cornerback in nickel and dime packages, recording three interceptions. He was named a starter in his sophomore year, and managed to record three picks. Butler became a standout in his junior year, producing 68 tackles (three for a loss) and four interceptions, including one key interception against Nebraska in the 2009 Gator Bowl. Butler chose to return to Clemson for his senior year and earn his degree in sociology, electing to wait one more year before declaring for the NFL draft. During the course of his senior season, the fear of turning the ball over caused opponents to throw his way just 14 times in the whole season, dropping his statistical output to only one interception and 8 passes defensed. Butler finished his collegiate career with 166 tackles, two sacks, and eleven interceptions. Professional career =2010 NFL Combine= Butler was originally projected to be a late first round selection before his senior year. After his statistically lacking season, opinions as a whole dropped negatively: some sources regarded Butler as an undrafted free agent target, while others rated him as a possible fifth round target. =Pittsburgh Steelers= The Pittsburgh Steelers selected Butler with their fifth round selection, 164th overall, of the 2010 NFL Draft. Butler was regarded as a long and athletic cornerback with good ball skills, albeit with a weak statistical senior season. He was signed to a three-year rookie contract, and was named to the 53-man roster. Although he was drafted in the fifth round only the year prior, he was waived by the Steelers on September 3, 2011. =Arizona Cardinals= On September 4, 2011, Butler was claimed off waivers by the Arizona Cardinals. He was placed on the injured reserve list on September 20 due to a dislocated ankle. On August 31, 2012, he was waived by Arizona, being one of the final roster cuts before the start of the 2012 season. =Washington Redskins= On September 1, 2012, the Washington Redskins claimed Butler off waivers. After playing in only two games, he was waived- injured on September 25 after suffering a hamstring injury in Week 2 against the Cincinnati Bengals. =Arizona Cardinals (II)= The Cardinals re-signed Butler on October 9, 2012, but released him a week later. He re-signed with the Arizona Cardinals on October 23, 2012, and was assigned to the practice squad. =Buffalo Bills= On November 7, 2012, Butler was signed from the Cardinal's practice squad, joining the Buffalo Bills active roster. He dressed in five games for the Bills, recording three tackles and a forced fumble against the New York Jets in Week 17. He was released on August 30, 2013. =San Diego Chargers= He was signed by the San Diego Chargers on September 17, 2013. Butler was released on August 29, 2014. =Tampa Bay Buccaneers= The Tampa Bay Buccaneers signed Butler on September 10, 2014 to replace the injured Mike Jenkins. Butler made his first career NFL start against the Baltimore Ravens on October 12, 2014. Tampa Bay released Butler on December 16. During his time with Tampa Bay, he made three starts and recorded 14 tackles. =Detroit Lions= The Detroit Lions signed Butler to a reserve/futures contract on January 7, 2015. Butler did not make the final 2015 roster and was cut in early September. =Seattle Seahawks= On October 13, 2015, Butler was signed by the Seattle Seahawks but was released a week later. = Detroit Lions (II) = On November 14, 2015, Butler re-joined the Lions, signing a one-year contract for $747,500 with a $2,500 signing bonus. This was necessitated by placing starting cornerback Rashean Mathis on injured reserve. In his first game with the Lions, against the Green Bay Packers, Butler batted down an attempted pass from Aaron Rodgers to Davante Adams during a two point conversion toward the end of the fourth quarter, preserving a two-point lead. The Lions won the game 18‚Äì16, ending a 24-year losing streak in the state of Wisconsin. He appeared in the final eight games of the season and finished with three total tackles on the year. On March 11, 2016, the Detroit Lions re-signed Butler to a one-year, $760,000 contract. On August 29, 2016, Butler was released by the Lions. He was re-signed on December 28, 2016. =Saskatchewan Roughriders= On June 7, 2017, Butler was signed by the Saskatchewan Roughriders. After the two game CFL preseason, Butler was released on June 18, but was assigned to the Roughriders' practice roster on June 25. Following the first four weeks of the season spent on the practice roster, Butler was promoted to the active game-day roster on July 22. During a 30‚Äì15 loss to the BC Lions on August 5, Butler was productive, recording 5 tackles, but gave up a touchdown after running into the goalpost in the end zone. Butler would later leave the game with an injury. As the season progressed, Butler was utilized as a blitzing cornerback in addition to his coverage duties, recording 2 sacks and a forced fumble to go along with 39 defensive tackles and 4 pass knockdowns in 15 games played for the 2017 season. During 2 playoff games played, Butler totaled 8 tackles, as well as a fumble recovery during the CFL East Championship, which saw the Roughriders lose to Toronto 25‚Äì21. During the off-season, the Roughriders extended Butler's rookie contract by a year, keeping him with the team through the end of 2019. In his second year with the Riders, Butler missed several games with injury. In 11 games, Butler made 31 tackles and 2 special teams tackles. What would have been his first professional interception was wiped out by an unrelated penalty by a teammate during a week 7 loss to Calgary on July 28, 2018. Butler made two tackles during the lone postseason game, a loss to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. Butler was released as a part of final cuts prior to the 2019 season. =Toronto Argonauts= Butler was signed by the Toronto Argonauts on July 3, 2019. He was released on July 10, 2019. =BC Lions= Butler was signed by the BC Lions on July 23, 2019. Butler finished the season playing 12 games and making 25 tackles. Butler also forced a fumble, and recorded his first career interception. =Toronto Argonauts (II)= On February 19, 2020, Butler signed as a free agent with the Toronto Argonauts.

VGAM consist of a tangled mass of dilated vessels supplied by an enlarged artery. The malformation increases greatly in size with age, although the mechanism of the increase is unknown. Dilation of the great cerebral vein of Galen is a secondary result of the force of arterial blood either directly from an artery via an arteriovenous fistula or by way of a tributary vein that receives the blood directly from an artery. There is usually a venous anomaly downstream from the draining vein that, together with the high blood flow into the great cerebral vein of Galen causes its dilation. The right sided cardiac chambers and pulmonary arteries also develop mild to severe dilation. Genetics 10% of vein of Galen aneurysmal malformations are associated with deleterious heterozygous mutations of EPHB4 Another study found that 30% of cases were associated with mutations in EPH receptor B4 (EPHB4) gene.Duran D, Zeng X, Jin SC, Choi J, Nelson-Williams C, Yatsula B, Gaillard J, Furey CG, Lu Q, Timberlake AT, Dong W, Sorscher MA, Loring E, Klein J, Allocco A, Hunt A, Conine S, Karimy JK, Youngblood MW, Zhang J, DiLuna ML, Matouk CC, Mane S, Tikhonova IR, Castaldi C, L√≥pez-Gir√°ldez F, Knight J, Haider S, Soban M, Alper SL, Komiyama M, Ducruet AF, Zabramski JM, Dardik A, Walcott BP, Stapleton CJ, Aagaard-Kienitz B, Rodesch G, Jackson E, Smith ER, Orbach DB, Berenstein A, Bilguvar K, Vikkula M, Gunel M, Lifton RP, Kahle KT (2018) Mutations in chromatin modifier and ephrin signaling genes in vein of Galen malformation. Neuron Signs and symptoms 3D reconstruction of CTA showing vein of Galen malformation. Malformations often lead to cardiac failure, cranial bruits (pattern 1), hydrocephaly, and subarachnoid hemorrhage in neonates. The heart failure is due to the size of the arteriovenous shunt that can steal 80% or more of the cardiac output, with large volumes of blood under high pressure returning to the right heart and pulmonary circulation and sinus venosus atrial septal defects. It is also the most common cause of death in such patients. =Associated conditions= Non-developmental syndromes also directly or indirectly affect the Great Cerebral Vein of Galen, although they are extremely rare. These include superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS), and thrombosis of the lateral sinus, superior sagittal sinus, internal jugular vein, or of the Great Cerebral Vein of Galen itself. Diagnosis Testing for a malformed vein of Galen is indicated when a patient has heart failure which has no obvious cause. Diagnosis is generally achieved by signs such as cranial bruits and symptoms such as expanded facial veins. The vein of Galen can be visualized using ultrasound or Doppler. A malformed Great Cerebral Vein will be noticeably enlarged. Ultrasound is a particularly useful tool for vein of Galen malformations because so many cases occur in infancy and ultrasound can make diagnoses prenatally. Many cases are diagnosed only during autopsy as congestive heart failure occurs very early. =Classification= Five patterns of Galenic arteriovenous malformations have been described: { class=wikitable + Patterns'' - ! Pattern 1  Many vessels, including anterior cerebral arteries, thalamic perforating arteries, and superior cerebellar arteries discharge into the vein of Galen. - ! Pattern 2  A single posterior choroidal artery drains into the vein of Galen. - ! Pattern 3  One or both posterior choroidal and one or both anterior cerebral arteries drain directly into the Galenic system. - ! Pattern 4  An angiomatous network of posterior choroidal and thalamic perforating arteries enter the Vein of Galen directly. - ! Pattern 5 A high flow arteriovenous malformation in the right inferior frontal lobe drains via the inferior sagittal sinus and pericallosal vein into the Vein of Galen. } These malformations develop in utero by the persistence of fistulae between primitive pia arachnoidal arteries and pial veins that cross each other at right angles. Because the primitive Galenic system and the primitive choroidal system lie close together, an arteriovenous malformation involving the primitive choroidal system will inevitably involve the Galenic vein. Larger arteriovenous shunts correlate with greater hemodynamic effects and earlier symptom onset; small arteriovenous shunts correlate with greater local mass effect causing progressive neurological impairment. Treatment Treatment depends on the anatomy of the malformation as determined by angiography or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). =Surgical= Head circumference measurements should be obtained regularly and monitored carefully to detect hydrocephalus. Neurosurgical procedures to relieve hydrocephalus are important. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt may be required in some infants. A pediatric cardiologist should be consulted to manage high- output failure, if present. Often patients need to be intubated. In most cases, the fistulous arteries feeding into the Vein of Galen must be blocked, thereby reducing the blood flow into the vein. Open surgery has a high morbidity and mortality. Recent advances over the past few decades have made endovascular embolization the preferred method of treatment. These treatments are preferred because they offer little threat to the surrounding brain tissue. However, there have been several reported cases of arteriovenous malformations recurring. The young age of many patients, the complex vascular anatomy, and the sensitive location of the Vein of Galen offer considerable challenges to surgeons. Another treatment option is Radiotherapy. Radiotherapy, also called radiosurgery, involves the use of focused beams to damage the blood vessel. Radiotherapy is often not pursued as a treatment because the effects of the procedure can take months or years and there is risk of damaging adjacent brain tissue. =Medical Care= Surgery is not always an option when the anatomy of the malformation creates too much of a risk. Recent improvements in endovascular procedures have made many cases, which were not surgically accessible, treatable. Endovascular treatments involve delivering drugs, balloons, or coils to the site of the malformation through blood vessels via catheters. These treatments work by limiting blood flow through the vein. There is, however, still risk of complications from endovascular treatments. The wall of the vein can be damaged during the procedure and, in some cases, the emboli can become dislodged and travel through the vascular system. Two-dimensional echocardiography with color-flow imaging and pulsed Doppler ultrasound was used to evaluate one fetus and five neonates with a Vein of Galen malformation. Color-flow imaging and pulsed Doppler ultrasonography provided anatomical and pathophysiological information regarding cardiac hemodynamics and intracranial blood flow; with the patient's clinical status, these methods provided a reliable, noninvasive means to evaluate the effectiveness of therapy and the need for further treatment in neonates with Vein of Galen malformations. When none of these procedures are viable, shunting can be used to ameliorate the pressure inside the varix. Seizures usually are managed with antiepileptic medications. Prognosis The complications that are usually associated with vein of Galen malformations are usually intracranial hemorrhages. Over half the patients with VGAM have a malformation that cannot be corrected. Patients frequently die in the neonatal period or in early infancy. Society and culture Vein of Galen malformations are devastating complications. Studies have shown that 77% of untreated cases result in mortality. Even after surgical treatment, the mortality rate remains as high as 39.4%. Most cases occur during infancy when the mortality rates are at their highest. Vein of Galen malformations are a relatively unknown affliction, attributed to the rareness of the malformations. Therefore, when a child is diagnosed with a faulty Great Cerebral Vein of Galen, most parents know little to nothing about what they are dealing with. To counteract this, support sites have been created which offer information, advice, and a community of support to the afflicted (, ).

It is partnered with University Hospitals of Cleveland. Southwest General Health Center is certified as a Level III Trauma Center and a Primary Stroke Center. History =Facilities= Southwest General Health Center was founded in 1920 as The Community Hospital. A flu epidemic in 1920 resulted in many deaths of patients while being transported to the nearest hospital in nearby Cleveland. Citizens of several southwestern Cleveland communities responded by raising $100,000 in only 10 days to build a local community hospital in Berea, Ohio. After several expansions and a name change to Southwest General Hospital, the current site ran out of room to expand. In 1973 the local communities of Berea, Brook Park, Olmsted Falls, Olmsted Township, Strongsville, and Middleburg Heights passed tax levies to support the building of a new 235-bed facility nearly a mile down the road from the original location in Middleburg Heights. This new facility went through several expansions in 1983, 1994, 2000, and 2006, putting the facility at its current capacity of 354 beds. In 1994, Southwest General Hospital changed its name to Southwest General Health Center to reflect its practices of preventative health care as well as remaining a primary care hospital. =The Old Oak= The new facility built from 1973 to 1975 was built on a large plot of land next to the Cuyahoga County Fairgrounds. This site had several old White Oak trees, one of which was more than 200 years old. This 200+ year old tree was left in place near the entrance of the new facility, and quickly became a symbol for the hospital. In 1995, after several attempts to save the tree from disease, the Old Oak was removed due to safety concerns. Several new White Oak trees have been planted, along with a seedling from the Old Oak in the tree's original location. The Old Oak has been a part of the Southwest logo since its move to the current location. Several of the nearby businesses and facilities are named after the Old Oak, as well as Old Oak Boulevard, which borders the west side of the hospital. =2013 Expansion= In 2013, Southwest General started construction on a $124 million expansion to the facility. The new expansion includes a 40,000 square foot emergency department, a 24-bed Critical Care Unit, a 250 car underground parking structure, and a new patient bed tower that added 96 private patient rooms to the facility. The emergency department opened in January 2014, and the Critical Care Unit opened three months later. The entire expansion project was completed in 2015. Partnering With University Hospitals In 1997, Southwest General entered into a partnering agreement with University Hospitals, This made Southwest General the flagship hospital for UH on Cleveland's West Side. Through this partnering agreement, Southwest General offers its communities local access to several of the specialty services offered by UH and their facilities. =Ireland Cancer Center= Southwest General built an addition to house their own branch of University Hospitals Ireland Cancer Center. This center is designated as a Comprehensive Cancer Center by the National Cancer Institute. This allows Southwest General to offer cancer treatment on-site, as well as providing access to clinical trials.

They were transported to England in 1870-1871.Robert Mathiesen, An Important Greek Manuscript Rediscovered and Redated (Codex Burdett-Coutts III.42), The Harvard Theological Review, Vol. 76, No. 1 (Jan., 1983), pp. 131-133. The manuscript was presented by Burdett-Coutts to Sir Roger Cholmely's School, and was housed at the Highgate (Burdett-Coutts III. 43), in London. The manuscript was added to the list of New Testament manuscripts by Scrivener (number 248) and Gregory (number 225). Gregory saw it in 1883. In 1922 it was acquired for the University of Michigan.Kenneth W. Clark, A Descriptive Catalogue of Greek New Testament Manuscripts in America (Chicago, 1937), p. 294.

The first traditional conjectures, originating from Alexander Grothendieck and introduced in Esquisse d'un Programme were about how topological homomorphisms between two groups of two hyperbolic curves over number fields correspond to maps between the curves. These Grothendieck conjectures were partially solved by Hiroaki Nakamura and Akio Tamagawa, while complete proofs were given by Shinichi Mochizuki. Before anabelian geometry proper began with the famous letter to Gerd Faltings and Esquisse d'un Programme, the Neukirch‚ÄìUchida theorem hinted at the program from the perspective of Galois groups, which themselves can be shown to be √©tale fundamental groups. More recently, Mochizuki introduced and developed a so called mono-anabelian geometry which restores, for a certain class of hyperbolic curves over number fields, the curve from its algebraic fundamental group. Key results of mono-anabelian geometry were published in Mochizuki's \\"Topics in Absolute Anabelian Geometry.\\" Formulation of a conjecture of Grothendieck on curves The \\"anabelian question\\" has been formulated as A concrete example is the case of curves, which may be affine as well as projective. Suppose given a hyperbolic curve C, i.e. the complement of n points in a projective algebraic curve of genus g, taken to be smooth and irreducible, defined over a field K that is finitely generated (over its prime field), such that :2 - 2g - n < 0. Grothendieck conjectured that the algebraic fundamental group G of C, a profinite group, determines C itself (i.e. the isomorphism class of G determines that of C). This was proved by Mochizuki. An example is for the case of g = 0 (the projective line) and n = 4, when the isomorphism class of C is determined by the cross-ratio in K of the four points removed (almost, there being an order to the four points in a cross- ratio, but not in the points removed). There are also results for the case of K a local field.

It grew to become arguably the most highly respected sport photo agency in the world, and its photographers won numerous awards until acquisition by Getty Images in 1998. Until 1968 Tony Duffy was an accountant and part-time photographer who shot track and field athletics in his spare time. He paid for himself to go to the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City. At the 1968 Olympic Games, Bob Beamon broke the World Record in the Long Jump with a leap of 8m 90 or 29 ft 2¬Ω inches. Crouched at the end of the long jump pit was Tony Duffy. Duffy took a picture which, through wide re-production, is perhaps the definitive shot of this remarkable jump. The Allsport agency was founded on the strength of his photograph of Beamon. 1970s Tony Duffy was joined in the 1970s by photographers John Starr, Don Morley who was Chief Photographer of Sportsworld magazine and the official photographer for the British olympic Association, and in 1971, Steve Powell. Powell would go on to become Group Managing Director. Morley specialised in shooting motorsport, specifically motorbikes, and Starr took studio shots. Adrian Murrell joined in the mid seventies and became the agency's Cricket specialist. Duffy's innovative feature 'Sport and the Body' brought his name and the name of the agency to a wider audience when published by the Sunday Times in 1973. The use of naked sports stars caused uproar and brought nationwide publicity. 1980s The Allsport agency experienced tremendous growth throughout the 1980s, and in 1983 Tony Duffy moved to California to open the Allsport USA offices in Santa Monica. In 1985 he was joined by Mike Powell, the younger brother of Steve. David Cannon joined in 1982 as a general sport photographer specialising in football and golf. With Duffy working stateside, Bob Martin assumed the role of leading athletics photographer in Europe. Younger photographers such as Mike King, Simon Bruty, Gray Mortimore, Mike Stahlschmidt, Jonathan Daniel and Pascal Rondeau continued to create stunning and thought-provoking sport images. In 1988 Allsport was appointed as Official Photographer to the International Olympic Committee. The first book in the Visions of Sport series was published to celebrate 20 years of Allsport, and included all of the famous images shot by Allsport photographers in its first 20 years. 1990s In 1998 Allsport was acquired by Getty Images.

He served as a Teachta D√°la (TD) for the Cork North-Central constituency from 2011 to 2019. He announced his resignation as a TD in December 2019, in the wake of a controversy about his lack of attendance in D√°il √âireann, in order to take a full-time position in the administration of the European Union. Early and personal life Murphy is from Mayfield, Cork. After attending Christian Brothers College, he studied economics at University College Cork from 1988, but failed his final exams; he finally graduated in 2015 after completing the necessary modules remotely. He started several catering businesses, the first while still in college; these prospered until the 2008 recession, when they folded, leaving him with tax debts which were settled in subsequent years. Political career Murphy was appointed to the National Economic and Social Council by the then Taoiseach John Bruton in October 1996, serving until the end of 1997. He was elected to Cork City Council in 2004 and 2009, serving as Deputy Lord Mayor from 2005 to 2006 and Lord Mayor from 2009 to 2010. He also served as the first Chair of the Cork Joint Policing Committee. In accordance with dual mandate restrictions, he vacated his council seat in 2011 after winning election to the D√°il . On 15 July 2014, Murphy was appointed as Minister of State with responsibility for data protection and European Affairs and at the Departments of the Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs and Trade respectively. He was dropped from the position by Leo Varadkar when he became Taoiseach in June 2017. In October 2017, Murphy was appointed Campaign Director for the European People's Party in the 2019 European Parliament election. In May 2018, Murphy announced that he intended to retire from D√°il √âireann at the next general election. In November 2019, Murphy revealed that he was resigning as a TD at the end of 2019 to take up a senior position in the European Commission. However, this was overshadowed by the controversy surrounding the expenses scandal, which saw him collect his D√°il √âireann expenses. From October 2017, Murphy was mainly based in Brussels where he worked with the European People's Party. During this period he drew his full D√°il salary of ‚Ç¨94,500 and his full parliamentary standard allowances of ‚Ç¨51,600 each year. Murphy had the lowest attendance rate in the D√°il on sitting days by a considerable margin during 2018 and 2019; attending on 42 days out of 104 in 2018, and 24 out of 70 until the end of September 2019. He resigned as a TD on 3 December 2019, which was announced in the D√°il the following day.

Its entries are dated between December 28, 1860, and March 15, 1861, the desperate weeks just before the start of the American Civil War. The Diary appeared to offer verbatim accounts, penned by a long-time Washington insider, of behind-the-scenes discussions at the very highest levels during the greatest crisis the country had yet faced. Its pithy quotations attributed to the key principals -‚Äî Stephen A. Douglas, William H. Seward, and especially Abraham Lincoln ‚Äî- have long been accepted by historians. David Potter, a leading specialist on 1860-61, said it contained \\"astonishing\\" revelations made by someone \\"who possessed an authoritative personal knowledge of affairs at the time of secession.‚ÄùPotter in Journal of Southern History (Feb. 1947) 13#1 pp 118‚Äì19. In the 21st century historians concluded that the diary was written by journalist William Henry Hurlbert in 1879, and represents not a real diary but a memoir. It contains both valuable unique information as well as a few fictional elements.Daniel W. Crofts, \\"Tracking Down ‚ÄúThe Public Man,‚Äù Journal of the Gilded Age & Progressive Era (2012) 11#4 pp 497-517. Contents of the Diary Douglas, the leading Northern Democrat who defeated Lincoln in 1858 to retain his Senate seat but who then lost to him in the 1860 presidential election, reached out to his former antagonist as the crisis deepened. Lincoln, who wanted to keep Northern Democrats \\"close to the Administration on the naked Union issue\\", proved receptive. Nothing better symbolized the rapport between the two Illinois rivals than an incident reported by the diarist on inauguration day. As Lincoln prepared to speak, he scarcely could find room for his hat on the \\"miserable little rickety table\\" that had been provided for the occasion. Douglas reached forward, \\"took it with a smile and held it during the delivery of the address\\". This spontaneous gesture \\"was a trifling act, but a symbolical one, and not to be forgotten, and it attracted much attention all around me\\". The diarist and Douglas both pinned their hopes for a peaceful settlement on Seward, who emerged as Lincoln's Secretary of State after having lost the Republican presidential nomination in 1860. Although his long public career as governor and senator from New York earned him a somewhat undeserved reputation for stigmatizing the South, Seward attempted during the secession winter to find a middle ground that would preserve the peace and hold the Union together. He became, in the eyes of the diarist, \\"the one man in whose ability and moderation the conservative people at the North have most confidence\\". From its first paragraph to its last, The Diary of a Public Man recounts the twists and turns as two successive presidents, the repudiated James Buchanan and the untested Lincoln, attempted to figure out what to do about Fort Sumter, the besieged federal fortress located on an artificial island at the mouth of Charleston harbor, South Carolina. The Diary conveys a strong sense of on-the-spot immediacy, reinforced by the diarist‚Äôs excellent ear. He wrote as if he were seated next to the principals and holding an audio recorder. Anyone who attempts to understand what was going through Lincoln‚Äôs mind as he took office and as he made the fateful decisions leading to war is bound to find the Diary intriguing. Controversy But two key questions hang over the Diary. Who wrote it? And was it genuine? The editor of the North American Review concealed the identity of its author, and historians have found it difficult to crack the secret. Jacques Barzun and Henry F. Graff‚Äôs influential reference work, The Modern Researcher, singles out the Diary for presenting the \\"most gigantic\\" problem of uncertain authorship in American historical writing.Jacques Barzun and Henry F. Graff, The Modern Researcher (Fourth Edition, San Diego: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1985), 135-36. In part because the diarist has remained elusive, the Diary has become suspect. Historian Frank Maloy Anderson, after spending years in detective work, concluded in 1948 that lobbyist Sam Ward (1814‚Äì1884) wrote the Diary, but that its contents were substantially concocted.Frank Maloy Anderson, The Mystery of \\"A Public Man\\": A Historical Detective Story (Minneapolis: Univ. of Minnesota Press, 1948); see also Kathryn Allamong Jacob, King of the Lobby: The Life and Times of Sam Ward, Man-About-Washington in the Gilded Age (Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 2009). Historian Daniel W. Crofts recently reopened the Diary to fresh scrutiny and concluded that it was not a diary, but a memoir, probably written shortly before it appeared in print in 1879. The word \\"Diary\\" was intentionally misleading. Crofts established that its author was New York journalist William Henry Hurlbert (1827‚Äì1895), based on striking parallels between the Diary and Hurlbert's distinctive writing style. Crofts paired with statistician David Holmes to use stylometry, the statistical analysis of literary style, which delivers a verdict that reinforces the case for Hurlbert.Daniel W. Crofts, A Secession Crisis Enigma: William Henry Hurlbert and \\"The Diary of a Public Man\\" (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State Univ. Press, 2010)‚Äîthe Diary appears as an appendix to this volume.; David I. Holmes and Daniel W. Crofts, ‚ÄúThe Diary of a Public Man: A Case Study in Traditional and Non-Traditional Authorship Attribution,‚Äù Literary and Linguistic Computing 25 (June 2010): 179‚Äì97. Acclaimed as \\"the most brilliant talent of the New York press\\" and \\"the only artist among American journalists\\", Hurlbert successfully perpetrated one of the most difficult feats of historical license.Eugene Benson, \\"W. H. Hurlbut\\", The Galaxy (Jan. 1869), 30-34. He pretended to have been a diarist who never existed, and he covered his tracks so well that he escaped detection. But Crofts also contends that Hurlbert's work was far from fictional‚Äîaside from the fabricated hocus-pocus regarding a nonexistent diarist. The Diary repeatedly introduces previously concealed information that was corroborated only after its publication. It contains precise details regarding the struggle to shape Lincoln‚Äôs cabinet. Its segments on the writing of Lincoln's inaugural address include key information that was not then part of the public realm‚Äîmost notably, the role played by Seward in persuading Lincoln to make last-minute revisions. The diarist also shed light on Seward's secret promise to leading Virginia Unionists in mid-March 1861 that Fort Sumter soon would be evacuated. Although there was no diarist, the substance of the Diary appears reliable. The Diary reflected Hurlbert's distinctive outlook, which was neither Northern nor Southern. Sooner than most Americans, he realized that his native South Carolina was on a collision course with New England, where he studied and lived from the mid-1840s to the mid-1850s. Although drawn for a time to the antislavery critique of the South, he had enough affinity with both sides of the sectional conflict to avoid becoming a partisan for either. He sensed that both sides were mutually blind to the potential catastrophe that their antagonism was creating. Hurlbert remained conflicted after the war started. He wanted the Union preserved, but he feared that prolonged fighting would so embitter the two sides as to make reunion impossible. He opposed emancipation on grounds that it would prompt the South to fight longer and harder. When the war finally ended, he favored a rapid restoration of the Southern states to the Union. He never thought the war should have been fought, and he never accepted the idea that it could be justified by its outcome. He thereby swam against the dominant tide of postwar Northern public opinion. His alleged Diary suggested that Northern Democrats, conservative Republicans, and Southern Unionists had acted more responsibly in early 1861 than extreme men on either side, who blindly stumbled into the abyss.Crofts, A Secession Crisis Enigma, 152. Modern jargon would call it a stretch to get The Diary of a Public Man back into the historical lexicon. But that is where it belongs. It parallels the work of Mary Chesnut, the observant South Carolinian who transformed skeletal notations made during wartime into something far more polished long after the fact. Her seeming diary was a memoir, historian C. Vann Woodward concluded, but \\"the facts bear her out\\" and her writing has \\"enduring value\\".C. Vann Woodward, ed., Mary Chesnut‚Äôs Civil War (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1981), xvi-xvii, xxv, xxvii. Much the same must be said for The Diary of a Public Man.

In 2014 he was released on parole, after an appellate court ruled that his jury had been given improper instructions.  Background  In addition to his position in the Black Panther Party, Conway was also employed by the United States Postal Service. He was unaware that some of the founding members of the Baltimore chapter of the Party were actually undercover officers at the Baltimore Police Department who reported daily on his activities at the chapter. At the same time, the Federal Bureau of Investigation had also started its own investigation of Conway, recording his whereabouts, contacting his employers at the Post Office and maintaining contact with the Baltimore Police Department. BPD shooting On the night of April 21, 1970, Baltimore Police Officers Donald Sager and Stanley Sierakowski were shot by three assailants who fired at least eight rounds at the officers during their response to a domestic disturbance call. Officer Sager was killed and Officer Sierakowski was critically wounded. About an hour later, Officers James Welsh and Roger Nolan arrested two men near the scene of the shooting, based on information they received over police radio. The men were Jackie Powell and Jack Ivory Johnson, and two pistols were found near the location where they were hiding. The police determined that these two men, Powell and Ivory Johnson, knew members of the Baltimore Black Panther Party chapter or were affiliated with it. Immediately after contact with the two men, Officer Nolan briefly chased a black man on foot and tried to make contact with him. The man then fired several shots at Nolan and escaped. Nolan stated that he had previously seen this man on his assigned beat and could recognize him, but he did not know his name. Based on the affiliation of the two suspects with the Black Panther Party, Nolan was shown two photo line-ups of party members. In the first line-up, Nolan claimed that a picture of Conway, taken seven years earlier in 1963, resembled the shooter. In the second line-up, which used a current photograph of Conway, Nolan positively identified Conway as the individual who had shot at him. Welsh also positively identified Conway as the man whom Nolan had chased. The next day, Conway was arrested while working at the Post Office. Following an investigation where the ballistics of both shootings were determined to match, Conway was charged with both the murder of Officer Sager and the attempted murders of Officers Sierakowski and Nolan. According to Conway, he was working during the time of the shooting and his supervisor at the Post Office affirmed his alibi. One of the weapons found with Powell and Johnson was also matched through ballistics testing to the murder of Officer Sager. Black Panther Party member Jack Ivory Johnson was released from Prison on May 2010. Trial Conway appealed to the court to be represented by either Charles Garry or William Kunstler, two attorneys who consistently represented party members. Both lawyers had offered their services free of charge. However, the court denied Conway‚Äôs request and appointed a lawyer who performed no pre-trial investigation and never met with Conway. Therefore, Conway chose to absent himself from much of his January 1971 trial. Before the trial, Johnson had confessed to the police, naming Powell and Conway as the ones who shot Officers Sager and Sierakowski. According to court testimony, Johnson stated he fired into the air because \\"I didn't have the heart to kill the pig.\\" But later, Johnson refused to testify against Conway and claimed his statement was coerced. The state‚Äôs case was based partially on photo identification by Officer Nolan. To strengthen its case, the state called Charles Reynolds, a known jailhouse informant. He testified that while he shared a cell with Conway before the trial, Conway confessed to him. However, as was verified by the court transcript, Conway had protested greatly when Reynolds was placed in his cell because everyone knew he was an informant. One of the points that proved key to the truthfulness of Reynolds was that Reynolds was told by Conway that he had taken Officer Sierakowski's watch, a fact that was not released by the police during the investigation. Finally, the ballistic evidence connecting the weapons to the murders also played a significant role in the trial. After hearing all the evidence, the jury convicted Conway of the murder, and both he and Powell were sentenced to life in prison. Both men appealed but the appellate court upheld the convictions. Controversy There are several controversies involving the trial and conviction of Conway. The trial took place just two years after the 1968 Baltimore riot, the use of the photo line-up was questioned and the reliability of the jailhouse informant was brought up. In addition, Conway fired two lawyers, the first (Nelson Kandel) over trial strategy differences and the second one that was appointed to represent him and who Conway refused to cooperate with. Conway requested that his cellmate, attorney Arthur Turco, be appointed to represent him. Turco requested bail to be able to do so, but both of these requests were denied. Conway claims to have been a political prisoner. Imprisonment During his imprisonment, Conway earned three college degrees, started a literacy program, and was an \\"exemplary\\" prisoner. During the entire time, Conway maintained his innocence. Conway's supporters have called him one of the country‚Äôs longest-held political prisoners. While incarcerated, Conway tried to organize prison unions and organized a prison library. In February 2001, the Baltimore City Council passed a resolution urging the Governor of Maryland to pardon Conway, over the strident protests of police officers. Conway has written a book on his life, Marshall Law: The Life & Times of a Baltimore Black Panther, that was released on April 4, 2011. Release After an appellate court ruled that his jury had been given improper instructions, state prosecutors agreed to change his life sentence to time served and probation, and Conway was released from prison on March 4, 2014 after having served 43 years and 11 months. He is currently a producer at The Real News and hosts the show Rattling the Bars.

The two novels of the series, In the Night Garden (not to be confused with the BBC TV series of the same name) and In the Cities of Coin and Spice, are in turn split into two books apiece. While three of these four books begin with a story told by the same young woman, her stories branch out into other stories, often narrated by a completely different character. The series won the 2008 Mythopoeic Award for Adult Literature, and In the Night Garden was nominated for both the 2006 James Tiptree, Jr. Award and the 2007 World Fantasy Award.

When he visits, she tells him the stories that are inked on her skin.The Orphan's Tales Official Website. . Retrieved 2008-12-11. The novel is split into two books, which revolve around two different casts of characters who inhabit the same world. Some characters appear in both books - as well as in the sequel, In the Cities of Coin and Spice; for example, the myths of the Stars run through numerous stories. Book of the Steppe: Prince Leander escapes his castle in search of adventure. Once he is on the road, he kills a goose for food and is accosted by a witch who accuses him of murdering her daughter. As he tries to redeem himself, he learns about the witch's life on the steppe, quests for the skin of a beast, and discovers the truth of his family's history. Book of the Sea: In the bitter cold of an icy country, to pass the time as they work, Sigrid the Netweaver tells a girl called Snow how she got her name: When she was young, she joined a group of monks traveling back to their temple and eventually entered into a temple of her own. Desperate to see the story to its conclusion, Snow convinces Sigrid to continue her quest to find the original Saint Sigrid. =In the Cities of Coin and Spice= First edition cover of In the Cities of Coin and SpiceThe friendship between the girl and the prince strengthens as she begins to tell him the stories inked on her second eye. While in the first volume the children had the garden almost completely to themselves, now the marriage of the prince's sister Dinazade threatens their sanctuary. The stories grow similarly darker, revolving around the two titular cities: one where coins are made from bones of the children who work at the mint, and the second, an exotic city that is home to a variety of fantastic creatures such as a firebird, a clockwork woman, and sirens.In The Cities of Coin and Spice Reviewed by Dan Hartland. . Retrieved 2008-12-11. Like the first volume, In the Cities of Coin and Spice is composed of two books. Although each book focuses on a different set of characters and new locations, some of the stories run through each part of the series. Book of the Storm: Seven, the seventh son in a farmer family, is ritualistically abandoned. Instead of being taken by the Stars, he is captured and forced to work at a mint, pressing coins out of bone. He escapes with Oubliette, a huldra, and they join a troupe of performers traveling across the countryside. Book of the Scald: Unlike the other three books, in Scald, it is the prince who tells the story. From the girl's eye, he reads about a city besieged by an army of djinn, and the one djinni who defies her kingdom to stop the war. Allusions The Orphan's Tales is written in the style of One Thousand and One Nights; like the latter's main character Scheherazade, the girl tells a story that then branches into more stories. The prince's sister is named Dinarzad, another reference to One Thousand and One Nights. Musical adaptations Singer-songwriter S. J.

In its present form, Gregynog Festival has been running annually since 1988 but it is a revival of festivals held at the same venue from 1933 to 1938 by Gwendoline and Margaret Davies, major patrons of the arts in Wales. The original Festivals were directed by the composer and organist Henry Walford Davies. A sequence of festivals was then held under the direction of the composer Ian Parrott from 1956-61 and a one-off Festival took place in 1972 featuring Benjamin Britten, Peter Pears and Osian Ellis. The modern incarnation was directed by the tenor Anthony Rolfe Johnson from 1988 until his retirement in 2006 when Dr Rhian Davies, the music historian and broadcaster, succeeded as Artistic Director. The Festival has hosted many major international performers including Jelly D'Aranyi in the 1930s, Evelyn Barbirolli in the 1950s, and, in its more recent history, John Lill, John Mark Ainsley, Bryn Terfel, Alison Balsom, The Sixteen and The King's Singers.

History Outriders was founded in 1968 by Max Wickert (then Assistant Professor of English in the University at Buffalo), Dan Murray (a Buffalo M.A. candidate in Creative Writing) and Doug Eichhorn (then studying under Donald Justice at Syracuse University). Max Wickert has been its Director since 1969. In the 1970s, Outriders, with support from the New York State Council on the Arts and Poets & Writers, Inc., ran a series of weekly poetry readings in Buffalo bars, typically involving a reading by a featured writer, followed by an open reading, in which celebrities visiting Buffalo often also participated. From 1978 to 1980, Outriders formed part of N.E.W. (Niagara-Erie Writers), a local writers‚Äô collective. Max Wickert served as an officer in both organizations. Weekly poetry readings Among distinguished poets who appeared in the series were Robert Bly, Albert S. Cook, Robert Creeley, Raymond Federman, Allen Ginsberg, Lee Harwood, David Ignatow, Milton Kessler, John Logan, A. Poulin, and John Wieners, as well poets relatively unknown at the time who eventually went on to high honors, such as Charles Baxter (National Book Award finalist, 2000), Carl Dennis (Ruth Lilly Prize 2000, Pulitzer Prize 2002), Cornelius Eady (Lamont Prize, 1985), Robert Hass (Poet Laureate of the United States 1995‚Äì97, National Book Award 2007, Pulitzer Prize 2008), and Rosmarie Waldrop (International PEN Award for Poetry in Translation, 2008). Other sponsored events During its opening seasons, Outriders worked closely with the Buffalo area Poets-in-the-Schools Program. This program had been conceived state-wide by the New York State Council for the Arts's Galen Williams. It was established in the Buffalo area by cooperation between three agencies: Outriders, which was the recipient of the initial grant; the Department of English at the University at Buffalo; and the University's Office of Cultural Affairs, then directed by Esther Harriott, who coordinated the entire venture. During its opening years, Outriders and Poetry-in-the-Schools frequently overlapped and a number of poets appeared in both programs. (In later seasons, Poetry-in-the-Schools operated independently.) In its 1970‚Äì71 season, Outriders also ran two \\"Third World Poetry Festivals\\" that showcased Latino poets Felipe Luciano, Jose-Angel Figueroa and Pedro Pietri (later well known as members of the Nuyorican school) and the late Nigerian poet, Pol Ndu. In 1978 and 1979, Outriders, through its Director, co-sponsored Summer Poetry Festivals with Artpark (Lewiston, NY) and the University at Buffalo, featuring, among others, Marvin Bell, Irving Feldman, Canada‚Äôs Four Horsemen (bpNichol, Paul Dutton, Steve McCaffery and Rafael Barreto-Rivera), Anselm Hollo, David Ignatow, J.F. Nims, Carlene Polite, Mark Rudman, Louis Simpson, William Stafford, Gerald Stern, Virginia Terris, and Harriett Zinnes. Publications During its first years, Outriders also planned a series of publications and chapbooks. Aside from a few ephemeral broadsides, only one of these appeared, Max Wickert‚Äôs All the Weight of the Still Midnight (1972; 2nd, expanded edition 2013). The weekly readings ceased in 1980 and Outriders suspended its activities for a number of years. In 2009, Wickert revived it as a small press which has since issued Ann Goldsmith‚Äôs The Spaces Between Us and Martin Pops‚Äôs Minoxidyl and Other Stories(2010); Judith Slater's The Wind Turning Pages (2011), Max Wickert's No Cartoons (2011), Gail Fischer's Red Ball Jets (2011), Jeremiah Rush Bowen's Consolations (2012) and Jerry McGuire's Venus Transit as well as An Outriders Anthology: Poetry in Buffalo 1969-1979 and After (2013),Jacob Schepers' A Bundle of Careful Compromises and Linda Stern Zisquit's Return from Elsewhere(2014); Edric Mesmer's of monody and homophonies (2015); the anthology Four Buffalo Poets: Ansie Baird, Ann Goldsmith, David Landrey, Sam Magavern (2016); Carole Southwood's Listen and See: Twenty-Two Poems and a Story'; and most recently, Carole Southwood's non- fiction novel Abdoo: The Biography of a Piece of White Trash. For five years, ending in 2015, the press conducted an annual competition open to poets and fiction writers with some significant connection to the Buffalo-Niagara Falls area. The winners of this competition were Jeremiah Rush Bowen (2011); Jerry McGuire (2012), Jacob Schepers and Linda Zisquit (co-winners 2014); and Edric Mesmer, Of Monodies and Homophony (2015). Beginning in 2016, authors are encouraged to submit unsolicited manuscript during the annual reading period from January 1 to April 15.

The hujja is a prophet or an Imam who possess a relationship with God that is greater than anyone else. The Imam who is the hujja of his time functions as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity, giving the Imam the greatest precedence for interpretation of the Qur'an. As the mediator between God and humanity, the Imam is the only one who can properly resolve conflicting interpretations of the Qur'an's words, giving the Imam ultimate authority over divine knowledge. In Twelver shi'ism the title \\"hujja\\" is specifically applied to the Twelfth Imam who is currently in a period of hiding and is attributed with the tradition of using Shi'i hadith to guide the religious community.http://www.brillonline.nl/subscriber/uid=3875/entry?entry=islam_COM-0297. The word Imam and hujja do not necessarily refer to the same person because an Imam may not be hujja but may keep the title of Imam. Proof of Hujja The Imam that is hujja is hujja for several different logical proofs that are supported by Shi'i Qur'an interpretation and Shi'i hadith. The first proof of an Imam who is hujja is presented by the Imam's role as mediator between God and humanity.Sayyid Mujtaba Musavi Lari,\\"Imamate and Leadership:Lessons on Islamic Doctrine.\\" Islamic Education Center. The divine appointment of the Imam, according to Shi'i belief, was passed down from the Prophet Muhammad to 'Ali and his sons al-Hasan and al-Husayn, who passed the divine knowledge onto their sons and so on. Therefore, it is only those who are members of the Prophet's family line that possess the divine knowledge from God and therefore are hujja. The second proof an Imam is hujja is shown by the inner guidance the Imam provides for mankind \\"for he is a channel of divine grace which comes to him inwardly from the suprasensible realm\\". The Imam with his extensive knowledge of the different levels of human behavior and spiritual faith, is able to influence others thoughts and inner beings to help aid them in the refinement of their souls and inward journey. The Imam's divine guidance from God gives him the ability to lead and influence, which is why the Imam is hujja (proof of God). The third proof an Imam is hujja is based on the Imam's immunity from the pollution of human sin. The Imam is such a divine spiritual figure he is free from committing human error or misinterpreting the Qur'an, which would otherwise lead to human error and sin. For a man who does commit sin is not fit to lead for he can spread sin and is therefore denied the rank of Imam and therefore cannot possess hujja. Only those who are free from error can be considered divinely touched and therefore are hujja and entitled to the Imamate. The fourth proof that the Imam is hujja is deducted by reason. God's grace keeps his creatures towards obedience and keeps them away from disobedience. However, if God orders man to do something He knows man cannot do or will have difficulty doing, He would contradict His own aim. Therefore, God gives humanity hujja to help lead man toward God and His spiritual greatness.Sayyid Sa'eed Akhtar Rizvi, \\"Imamate: The Vicegerency of the Prophet [s].\\" Organization for Islamic Services. The hujja sent here is filled with spiritual guidance and helps direct man towards God, which is also what the Imam does, which is why the Imam is hujja. The last justification of the hujja comes from the idea that without the hujja the world would not exist. \\"The world cannot exist even for a moment without the imam who is the hujja of God. If the imam were to be taken away from the earth even for an hour, the earth would swallow up its inhabitants just as the sea swallows its people\\".Lalani, A.R \\"Early Shi'i Thought: The Teachings of Imam Muhammad Al-Baqir.\\" I.B. Tauris & Co., Ltd. 2000, 83. The idea that the Imam, who is hujja, is always present helps support the fact that God is always present to mankind and it supports the fact that it is only through the Imam that God can be known.

In 1957 Nu-West Homes was a small, privately owned, house-building company operating in Calgary, Alberta. In 1969, Nu-West Homes Ltd. became a publicly traded company and was listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. By 1981 Nu-West Group Ltd. had become the largest house-building company in Canada, with diversified asset holdings of $1.9 billion, and over 3,700 employees. The company was heavily leveraged with debt used to purchase vast holding of real estate throughout Canada and the United States. This debt, combined with the recession of the early 1980s that saw land values tumble, resulted in Nu-West losing it place of dominance in the industry. Beginnings Ralph Scurfield, Nu-West's president from 1957 until his death in 1985, worked long hard hours to build up the near bankrupt house building company into a multibillion-dollar business. Scurfield's route to housing development was circuitous. After receiving his Bachelor of Science degree at the University of Manitoba, he was a school teacher in that province for two years, working the summers on construction jobs. In 1951 Scurfield abandoned his teaching career and drove to Edmonton, lured then, as others are now, by stories of opportunity and wealth in Alberta. Soon after his arrival, Scurfield got a job working for Cheseley McConnell, a small homebuilder who became one of Edmonton's biggest during the six years Scurfield worked for him. In 1957, two of McConnell's partners, Clifford Lee and Gordon Clark, were saddled with Nu-West Homes Ltd., a 12-year-old near bankrupt homebuilding company located in Calgary. It was rapidly sinking because nobody would buy its poorly constructed houses. Lee and Clark were looking for a manager to replace the one they had just fired. McConnell knew that Scurfield was eager to become a partner in McConnell's business. It was instead decided that each would buy 25 percent of Nu-West's then $60,000 assets and Scurfield would move to Calgary to revive the company. To come up with his $15,000 stake, Scurfield, in a classic rags to riches saga, sold his Edmonton home for $21,000, recovered the $9,000 home equity, and used $1,500 as a down payment on another house in Calgary. The remaining $7,500 provided half the money toward buying into Nu-West and the rest came from a bank loan. In 1981, Scurfield and his family owned 26 percent of Nu-West, then worth about $50 million. McConnell was the second largest shareholder with 21 percent. Scurfield took Peter Vast, a Dutch immigrant who was 10 years older and who had worked as a construction crew leader for McConnell, to Calgary with him as his only employee. The two men then set about repairing the shoddy workmanship of Nu-West Homes and, hence, to polish up Nu-West's reputation During the day, Scurfield and Vast would install towel bars and paint rooms that had been left unfinished. At night, Scurfield would do the estimating and bookkeeping and Vast would do draft designs for the 65 new houses they planned to build the first year. To further clean up Nu-West's tarnished reputation, Scurfield offered owners of Nu-West homes a five-year warranty, which was the first of its type in Canada. In 1972, the warranty was expanded to a ten-year coverage. The hard work paid off. Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, which had cracked down on Nu-West by chopping off $3,000 from any loan guarantee, removed the restriction. Nu-West's other major source of funds, Investors Syndicate Ltd., which had stopped providing mortgage money because of customer complaints, also restored Nu-West to its lending list. Growth Scurfield slowly and methodically enlarged Nu-West, first through geographical expansion and later through a series of acquisitions starting in Canada and then in the United States' Sun Belt. Nu-West had grown from the homebuilder of the 1960s to the more diversified real estate company of the 1970s, and by 1980 Nu-West had become a diversified company with major interests in oil and gas and income properties. Throughout the 1970s, Nu-West continued its tradition of growth and profitability. During the decade Nu-West's average annual growth in net income has been 49%. In 1979, despite record interest rates and spiralling costs, revenues and net income increased more than 50%, and assets passed the billion dollar mark and totalled $1.28 billion at year end. The financial growth was the result of Canadian land sales, U.S. real estate operations and the successful operations of Voyager Petroleums Ltd. During 1979 the wholly owned Voyager Petroleums increased production and reserves of oil and gas through an aggressive exploration program, and they also increased their acreage holdings substantially.Nu-West Group Limited. Annual Report 1979, p.2 Highlights of Nu-West's 1979 real estate activities were the growth of the Phoenix operation and the expansion of commercial and industrial operations. Nu-West Development Corporation of Arizona recovered much of its former market position to become one of the largest residential builders in Phoenix. This company also became involved in the profitable condominium conversion market in several \\"Sunbelt\\" cities. Nu-West ended the 1970s proud of their achievements to that point, and entered the 1980 with business goals that included the plan to increase their real estate activities, with emphasis on land and commercial development, and also the expansion of their oil and gas investment so that within five years it would employ approximately one-third of their assets. In 1980, seeking to increase the potential for greater oil and gas revenues, Nu-West aggressively doubled Voyagers' 1979 budget for oil and gas exploration and development programs. By 1981, just 12 years after going public in 1969, Nu-West evolved from being a poorly regarded Calgary builder to one having operations in five Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario) and in ten U.S. states (Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas).NuWest also had a Seattle, Washington office in the late 1970‚Äôs located in Federal Way, Washington. Formerly this entity was United Homes begun many years before by Herman Sarkowsky. Early 1980s Things began to get tough in the early 1980s when the Canadian federal government brought in the National Energy Program (NEP), which didn't allow Albertans to sell oil to the Canadian market at world prices. This policy decimated Alberta's Petroleum industry. People left Alberta in droves and almost no one bought homes, with existing owners walking away from mortgages.http://www.carma.ca/us/NewsEvents/Roller%20coaster.aspx The negative effects of the NEP, combined with the North American-wide recession of the early 1980s that saw land values tumble, resulted in Nu-West, who was heavily leveraged with debt, losing its place of dominance in the industry.

It stemmed from a protest against censorship of the American television show South Park episode \\"201\\", led by the show's distributor Comedy Central, in response to death threats that had been made against some of those responsible for two segments broadcast in April 2010. A drawing representing Mohammed was posted on the Internet on April 20, 2010, with a message suggesting that \\"everybody\\" create a drawing depicting Mohammad on May 20 in support of free speech. U.S. cartoonist Molly Norris of Seattle, Washington created the artwork in reaction to Internet death threats that had been made against animators Trey Parker and Matt Stone for depicting Muhammad in an episode of South Park. Postings on RevolutionMuslim.com (under the pen name Abu Talha al-Amrikee; later identified as Zachary Adam Chesser) had said that Parker and Stone could wind up like Theo van Gogh, a Dutch filmmaker who was stabbed and shot to death. Norris claimed that, if people draw pictures of Muhammad, radical Islamist terrorists would not be able to murder them all, and threats to do so would become unrealistic. Within a week, Norris' idea became popular on Facebook, was supported by numerous bloggers, and generated coverage on the blog websites of major U.S. newspapers. As the publicity mounted, Norris and the man who created the first Facebook page promoting the May 20 event disassociated themselves from it. Nonetheless, planning for the protest continued with others \\"taking up the cause\\". Facebook had an \\"Everybody Draw Mohammed Day\\" page, which grew to over 100,000 participants (101,870 members by May 20). A protest page on Facebook against the initiative named \\"Against ‚ÄòEverybody Draw Mohammed Day'\\" attracted slightly more supporters (106,000 by May 20). Subsequently, Facebook was temporarily blocked by Pakistan; the ban was lifted after Facebook agreed to block the page for users in India and Pakistan. In the media, Everybody Draw Mohammed Day attracted support from commentators who felt that the campaign represented important issues of freedom of speech, and the need to stand up for this freedom. History =Background= South Park episodes \\"200\\" and \\"201\\", broadcast in April 2010, featured a character in a bear costume, who various other characters stated was Muhammad. The South Park episode sparked statements from the extremist website Revolution Muslim, which posted a picture of the partially decapitated body of the Dutch filmmaker, Theo van Gogh, with a statement declaring that Parker and Stone could meet a similar fate. The group running the website said it was not threatening Parker and Stone, however, it also posted the addresses of Comedy Central's New York office and the California production studio where South Park is made. Comedy Central self-censored the episode when it was broadcast by removing the word \\"Muhammad\\" and a speech about intimidation and fear from the South Park episode. =Molly Norris cartoon= Molly Norris drew the original, poster-like cartoon on April 20, 2010, which declared May 20, 2010, to be the first annual \\"Everybody Draw Mohammed Day\\".

She sent a copy of her illustration to Dan Savage, who posted it on his blog on April 22. On April 23, she was interviewed by Dave Ross of KIRO, a local Seattle radio station. Norris responded to a question \\"Are you sure you want to do this?\\", and said \\"Yeah, I want to water down the targets ... as a cartoonist I just felt so much passion about what had happened, I wanted to counter Comedy Central‚Äôs message about feeling afraid.\\" The motivation for the protest was not simply to defend the South Park creators, but also to support the right to free speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. She also said, \\"it's a cartoonist's job to be non-PC.\\"Dave Ross Interviews Molly Norris , MyNorthwest.com, April 23, 2010. On her website, Norris stated that the idea was not to disrespect Islam, but to support everybody's freedom of expression.

The Raw Story called the idea of the protest movement \\"a snarky response\\" to the threats from Revolution Muslim against South Park. A blog was created for the fictional group \\"\\"Citizens Against Citizens Against Humor\\", at www.cacah.org. By April 27, there were over 9,000 confirmed guests that planned to participate in the event. A story about the protest movement was one of the most popular articles highlighted on the website Digg.com. On April 28, The Malaysian Insider reported that the protest movement \\"appears to be gaining ground\\", and some schools planned to join in the event. Michael C. Moynihan of Reason stated he planned to select some of his favorite depictions of Muhammad from the protest movement, and then add them to the Reason.com website. By May 3, 2010, there were 11,000 members of the protest movement on Facebook, and individuals had submitted over 460 pictures. =Cartoonist and Facebook page creator end involvement= On April 25, Norris wrote on her website that the response to her idea had surprised and shocked her: \\"I did not intend for my cartoon to go viral. I did not intend to be the focus of any 'group'. I practice the First Amendment by drawing what I wish. This particular cartoon of a 'poster' seems to have struck a gigantic nerve, something I was totally unprepared for. I am going back to the drawing table now!\\" On April 26, she wrote on her website: \\"I am NOT involved in \\"Everybody Draw Mohammd [sic ] Day! I made a cartoon that went viral and I am not going with it. Many other folks have used my cartoon to start sites, etc. Please go to them as I am a private person who draws stuff\\". She also asked Savage to replace the original illustration she had given him with another one she drew that was tamer, but Savage refused. Asked why she initially publicized it, she replied, \\"Because I'm an idiot.\\" Norris said the campaign had grown much bigger than she initially intended, and that her cartoon was being used in ways she couldn't control. \\"I just want to go back to my quiet life\\", she told the writer of a blog about comics at The Washington Post. Wellington announced on April 26 that he, too, was dropping out of the movement. \\"I am aghast that so many people are posting deeply offensive pictures of the Prophet,\\" he wrote. \\"Y'all go ahead if that's your bag, but count me out.\\" Norris acknowledged, \\"I said that I wanted to counter fear and then I got afraid.\\" On April 29, Norris suggested that \\"Everybody Draw Mohammed Day\\" be called off: \\"Let's call off 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day' by changing it to 'Everybody Draw Al Gore Day' instead. Enough Mohammed drawings have already been made to get the point across.

Writing for The Daily Telegraph, Alex Spillius commented, \\"No one should blame Norris for withdrawing from the fray, for this kind of case throws up lingering and insidious uncertainties. Any threat could blow over quickly or endure, Rushdie-style, for decades. The row over the cartoons depicting Mohammed in the Danish paper Jyllands-Posten percolated for months before bubbling over into violent protests.\\" William Wei of The Business Insider was more critical of the decision by the cartoonist to withdraw from the protest movement, with an article titled, \\"Artist Who Proposed 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day!' To Protest South Park Censorship Wimps Out.\\" =Protest movement continued= An information technology specialist named Mimi, based in Toronto, Canada, helped to lead the protest movement in the wake of the departures of Norris and Wellington. Mimi stated to AOL News that the protest movement should be regarded as, \\"pro-free speech, not anti-Muslim.\\" She commented, \\"If [Muslims] are offended, they have the right to be offended ‚Äì just like Christians.\\" With regard to keeping with the tenets of Freedom of Speech, Mimi is permitting a wide array of depictions of Muhammad \\"except for those inciting violence or pornographic in nature.\\" \\"Mainstream society does whatever the Muslim society asks out of fear of violence or political correctness.

Silverman stated he agreed with the rationale behind the idea, commenting, \\"Whether this succeeds or not, and I have no personal interest in drawing Muhammad, I support the concept. We must join together to stop injustice.\\" A columnist for The Washington Post Writers Group wrote that Norris should not be regarded as having further responsibility related to the movement; and affirmed that her Muhammad cartoon had significantly impacted a greater discussion about the issue. Telepolis described some of the pictures submitted to the Facebook group in support of the protest movement as, \\"funny, crude, silly, original, the whole range of possibilities.\\" The Jawa Report urged individuals to participate in the protest movement, but encouraged them to post images reflecting positively on Muhammad. Writing in an editorial for The Washington Times, Jason Greaves urged individuals to participate in the protest event on May 20. Greaves concluded, \\"Theo van Gogh was murdered for making a movie critical of Islam. 'South Park' creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone are threatened with the same fate. They deserve our solidarity, and I will stand with them by hosting images of Muhammad on my own website. Please stand with us.\\" In a May 17, 2010 article in The Daily Bruin, writer Tyler Dosaj noted that numbers of both supporters and critics of the protest movement were increasing: \\"The Facebook group is 35,000 strong. To compare, the anti-Draw Mohammed Day group is almost 30,000 strong. Both are gaining members rapidly.\\" In a May 18, 2010 article, \\"Why We're Having an Everybody Draw Mohammed Contest on Thursday May 20\\", Reason editor Nick Gillespie explained: \\"No one has a right to an audience or even to a sympathetic hearing, much less an engaged audience. But no one should be beaten or killed or imprisoned simply for speaking their mind or praying to one god as opposed to the other or none at all or getting on with the small business of living their life in peaceful fashion. If we cannot or will not defend that principle with a full throat, then we deserve to choke on whatever jihadists of all stripes can force down our throats.\\" Gillespie asserted, \\"Our Draw Mohammed contest is not a frivolous exercise of hip, ironic, hoolarious sacrilege toward a minority religion in the United States (though even that deserves all the protection that the most serioso political commentary commands). It's a defense of what is at the core of a society that is painfully incompetent at delivering on its promise of freedom, tolerance, and equal rights.\\" As May 20, 2010, came closer, Molly Norris stated she was staying away from being directly involved in the protest movement. Norris told Dave Ross, \\"I'm against my own concept becoming a reality.... If I had wanted to be taken seriously, I would be thrilled, but now I'm horrified because people did take it as an actual day. The one-off cartoon is not good as a long term plan because it's offensive.\\" Fox News Channel reported that on May 19, 2010, a Facebook group supporting the protest movement had 41,000 members, and The Register reported this increased to 43,000 the same day. Norris told Fox News Channel in a statement on May 19, \\"It's turned into something completely different, nothing I could've imagined it morphing into. I'm happy some people are talking, because obviously this needs to be addressed.\\" By May 20, the Toronto Sun reported that both the \\"Everybody Draw Mohammed Day\\" group and the \\"Against 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day'\\" Facebook group protesting against the initiative had attracted more than 100,000 supporters, at 101,870 members and 106,000 members respectively. On May 20, 2010, Nick Gillespie and Matt Welch of Reason announced the winners of the publication's \\"Everybody Draw Mohammed Day\\" contest. Gillespie and Welch warned the reader not to view the image \\"if you are offended by graphical representations of the Prophet Mohammed.\\" Of the images highlighted, Gillespie and Welch explained: \\"The single most important element‚Äìand the thing that ties these selections together‚Äìis that each image forces the viewer to do two things. First, they consciously call into question the nature of representation, no small matter in fights over whether it is allowed under Islamic law to depict Mohammed ... Second, each of the images forces the viewer to actively participate not simply in the creation of meaning but of actually constructing the image itself.\\" There were two images in the position of runner-up ‚Äì one was an artistic rendition of a tobacco smoking pipe. The depiction references surrealist artist Ren√© Magritte, and includes the text, \\"This is not a pipe. This is Muhammed.\\" The Reason journalists commented that the image toyed with Magritte's \\"famous statement about the necessary disjuncture between a picture and the thing it seeks to represent.\\" The second runner-up was a parody of the Where's Waldo? series, and the winner was a connect the dots picture. Commenting on the winner of the Reason contest, Gillespie and Welch concluded, \\"There is a deeper lesson here: Connect the dots and discover that we all must be Spartacus on Everybody Draw Mohammad Day. And that in a free society, every day is Everybody Draw Mohammed Day.\\" =Pakistan Internet block= Subsequent to an order from the Lahore High Court on May 19, 2010, the government of Pakistan, through its agency the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), indefinitely banned Facebook in the country, in response to the impending May 20 date at the focus of the protest movement. The order to carry out the shut down of Facebook in Pakistan was given by the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, which also publicized an email address and phone number and requested individuals contact the agency to let them know about \\"all similar URLs where such objectionable material is found\\". Representative Khoram Ali Mehran of the Pakistan agency stated to CNN, \\"Obviously it (the blocking of Facebook) is related to the objectionable material that was placed on Facebook. That is why it is blocked. We have blocked it for an indefinite amount of time. We are just following the government's instructions and the ruling of the Lahore High Court. If the government decides to unblock it then that's what we will do.\\" The agency was responding to an action by a group of Islamic attorneys based in Pakistan, who had acted to get the court order due to a Facebook group \\"Everybody Draw Mohammad Day‚ÄîMay 20\\". Azhar Siddique had filed the petition to the Lahore High Court on behalf of the organization, the Islamic Lawyers Forum. The government faced pressure from public protests against Facebook. In its petition to the government, the Islamic Lawyers Forum described the \\"Everybody Draw Mohammed Day\\" event as \\"blasphemous\\". Siddique told The Times, \\"The court has also ordered the foreign ministry to investigate why such a competition is being held.\\" The lawyers succeeded in getting the government to block the Facebook group itself individually on May 18, but the Islamic lawyers requested a full block of the entirety of the Facebook site, because the organization had permitted the posting of the particular group on its site. They argued that unless the entire Facebook website were blocked, it would be difficult to stop the protest movement campaign on the site. The Lahore court carried out this request, and ordered the government to issue a temporary block on Facebook to stand until May 31, 2010. Justice Ejaz Chaudhry of the Lahore High Court issued the ruling of the court. The court's ruling determined that the content of the protest movement on Facebook would damage the religious beliefs of the 45 million users of the website in Pakistan. The force of the ban was effective immediately after the ruling of the court. Those present for the court's ruling included many religious clerics, attorneys, and students. The court held an in-depth hearing on the matter on May 31, 2010. The deputy attorney general of Punjab province, Naveed Inayat Malik, confirmed to the Press Association that the Lahore court had ordered Facebook banned in the country until May 31, 2010. The Secretary of the Pakistan Ministry of Information Technology, Naguib Malik, told the Associated Press that he requested the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority to carry out the ruling of the Lahore court. Pakistan Law Minister Babar Awan told ABC News, \\"this issue will be raised on all international forums.\\" According to Press Trust of India, by mid-day on May 19, 2010, individuals in Pakistan were not able to gain access to the Facebook site via computer, but could get entry using a smartphone. The Hindu reported that prior to the court's ruling, multiple Internet service providers had taken independent action to block Facebook, in light of protests against the website in Pakistan. The May 20 plans of the protest movement sparked demonstrations in the streets of Pakistan and objections to Facebook by groups including the Pakistan-based Muslim Lawyers Movement. In several Pakistani cities demonstrators burned the Norwegian flag although the Norwegian News Agency reported that the Norwegian flag was burned mistakenly in the belief that it was the Danish. In Lahore both Swedish and Danish flags were burned, A lawyer involved in the action in the Lahore court, Rai Bashir, told The Daily Telegraph, \\"There are so many insults to the Prophet on the Internet and that's why we felt we had to bring this case. All Muslims in Pakistan and the world will be supporting us.\\" Bashir explained to Sky News, \\"We moved the petition in the wake of widespread resentment in the Muslim community against the Facebook contest.\\" Islamic Lawyers Forum attorney, Chaudhry Zulfikar Ali, told Xinhua News Agency, \\"The competition has hurt the sentiments of the Muslims.\\" Protesters against Facebook and \\"Everybody Draw Mohammed Day\\" converged in Karachi on May 19, 2010, and held up signs and yelled phrases critical of Facebook. According to the Associated Press, approximately 2,000 female students protested in Karachi, urging the banning of Facebook for permitting the \\"Everybody Draw Mohammed Day\\" movement on the site. Agence France-Presse compared this to the 2006 protests over the depictions of Muhammed in European newspapers. They went on to report that there were approximately 20 individuals demonstrating outside the court in Lahore after its decision, holding signs which were negative regarding Facebook. Picketers outside the court held up signs praiseworthy of Muhammad. One protest sign at a picket in Lahore read: \\"We love Muhammad. Say No to Facebook.\\" BBC News noted reports in Pakistan media that there were protests against Facebook on May 19, 2010 outside parliament in Islamabad. Individuals passed on text messages, requesting other Facebook users to support the ban on the website. Attorneys standing outside the Lahore court on May 19, 2010 were repeating the phrase, \\"Down with Facebook\\". Protests against Facebook were organized in Lahore, Kasur, Narowal, Gujranwala, Rawalpindi and Peshawar; by Pakistan-based religious parties including Jamaat-e-Islami, Islami Jamiat Tulba and Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam. According to The Financial Express, \\"protests against the website were held across the country\\". The Vancouver Sun reported that Hamid Saeed Kazmi, Pakistan Religious Affairs Minister, \\"strongly condemned\\" the Facebook groups' efforts and requested Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani \\"to take immediate action and call a Muslim conference\\". The Facebook group had supporters including Dutch politician Geert Wilders, former Dutch politician and feminist activist Ayaan Hirsi Ali. An Islamic student association based in Lahore, Pakistan, handed out pamphlets requesting individuals to boycott Facebook; the pamphlet stated: \\"The west is conspiring against the honour of the prophet and of Muslims. The real purpose of freedom of speech is to provoke the sentiments of Muslims.\\" A representative of the Karachi-based Internet company Creative Chaos named Shakir Husain told The Guardian that a ban of Facebook would not be easy to carry out due to the ability to circumvent it using tactics such as proxy servers. Husain noted, \\"By banning this web page, it will just make people more curious. It's pouring petrol on a small fire that could become a lot bigger. You can't police the Internet. The Saudis have tried it, as have other governments, and all have failed. It's a waste of state money.\\" The CEO of the company Nayatel, Wahaj- us-Siraj, told Reuters that the decision of the Lahore court was not wise: \\"Blocking the entire website would anger users, especially young adults, because the social networking website is so popular among them and they spend most of their time on it. Basically, our judges aren't technically sound. They have just ordered it, but it should have been done in a better way by just blocking a particular URL or link.\\" The Gabriel Consulting Group analyst Dan Olds commented about the Pakistan government's ban to Computerworld, \\"I think we can expect to see more of this type of thing coming from dictatorial countries as they try to keep their citizenry locked down.\\" Olds observed, \\"Trying to stop citizens from accessing the Internet is increasingly becoming like a little kid trying to stop the tide with a toy shovel and a bucket.\\" An editorial in the Pakistan-based newspaper the Express Tribune commented on the ban of Facebook, \\"Many users of the social media website have put up their own pages expressing their admiration for the Holy Prophet ‚Äî surely this is a better response. Furthermore, the said page is one of millions on Facebook and blocking it entirely means that millions of users in Pakistan will be unable to access a site which has become part of their daily life. A better way would be to block the offensive web page but allow users in this country access to the rest of Facebook.\\" A representative of Facebook told CBS News that the block of the website in Pakistan was under investigation by the company. The company released a statement on May 19, 2010: \\"While the content does not violate our terms, we do understand it may not be legal in some countries. We are investigating this. In cases like this, the approach is sometimes to restrict certain content from being shown in specific countries.\\" The Jakarta Globe reported that several Muslim religious scholars in Indonesia were critical of Facebook in light of the protest movement. Rohadi Abdul Fatah the Indonesia, Religious Affairs Ministry director of Islam and Shariah Law, announced that Facebook was to be considered haram (forbidden) according to Muslim law. Rohadi Abdul Fatah stated, \\"We cannot tolerate it. Those who created the account were extremely irresponsible.\\" Indonesia Communication and Information Minister Tifatul Sembiring stated to The Jakarta Globe, \\"I consider this an act of provocation to mess up religious harmony enjoyed by Indonesians. I call on everybody to stay calm. Let us all just cool down.\\" Sembiring stated his intention to write the management of Facebook, and noted, \\"Removing it is useless because other party can just post it again on the account. Therefore, we all need to be aware of this.\\" On May 20, 2010, the Internet ban by the government of Pakistan related to \\"Everybody Draw Mohammed Day\\" was extended to include the video-sharing website, YouTube. YouTube released a statement, saying it is \\"looking into the matter and working to ensure that the service is restored as soon as possible\\". The Pakistan Telecommunications Authority stated it ordered the shut down of YouTube in the country due to \\"blasphemous content\\". A representative of YouTube told BBC News, \\"YouTube offers citizens the world over a vital window on cultures and societies and we believe people should not be denied access to information via video. Because YouTube is a platform for free expression of all sorts, we take great care when we enforce our policies. Content that violates our guidelines is removed as soon as we become aware of it.\\" Additional websites including Flickr were blocked in Pakistan on May 20. The Pakistan Telecommunications Authority had first tried to block separate pages on YouTube; representatives of the agency stated to Reuters, \\"but the blasphemous content kept appearing so we ordered a total shut down\\". Pakistan restricted access to Wikipedia and banned viewing of certain pages on the website in the country on May 20, 2010, according to Fast Company, The New York Times, Radio France Internationale, The Express Tribune, The Washington Post, Computerworld, Newsweek, Agence France-Presse, and the Financial Times. Agence France-Presse noted, \\"The Pakistan Telecommunications Authority (PTA) extended a ban on Facebook, ordered by a court until May 31, to popular video sharing website YouTube and restricted Wikipedia.\\" The Washington Post reported, \\"At least 450 sites, including Wikipedia, were also cut off by midday\\" on May 20. Radio France Internationale quoted the editor of The Friday Times, who stated, \\"They‚Äôve banned not just Facebook, now you have YouTube. They‚Äôre also blocking Flickr, I‚Äôve just heard that they‚Äôve blocked Wikipedia ... eager beavers sitting in the PTA and in other ministries are just going on and blocking sites.\\" The New York Times reported that the ban, \\"also included certain pages on Flickr and Wikipedia\\". According to Radio France Internationale, and Newsweek, pages were blocked on Wikipedia by the Pakistan agency due to what the government described as \\"growing sacrilegious contents\\". Ahmad Rafay Alam of the Pakistani English-language daily newspaper The Express Tribune commented, \\"the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority has taken it upon itself to block Wikipedia, among other things.\\" The Christian Science Monitor reported, \\"Pakistan blocked YouTube, Wikipedia, and other websites ... to try to suppress a Facebook page declaring Thursday Everybody Draw Mohammad Day.\\" Reuters reported on May 20 that \\"websites, including Wikipedia and Flickr, have been inaccessible in Pakistan\\" since the previous evening. According to Agence France-Presse, a representative of the organization the Internet Service Providers Association of Pakistan, Wahaj us Siraj, stated \\"Wikipedia had been blocked\\" in the country. A representative of the United States Department of State weighed in on the actions of the Pakistan government with respect to the images. Assistant Secretary of State Philip J. Crowley stated that the United States was critical of a \\"deliberate attempt to offend Muslims\\". Crowley commented, \\"Pakistan is wrestling to this issue. We respect any actions that need to be taken under Pakistani law to protect their citizens from offensive speech.\\" The Assistant Secretary of State went on to note, \\"At the same time, Pakistan has to make sure that in taking any particular action, that you‚Äôre not restricting speech to the millions and millions of people who are connected to the Internet and have a universal right to the free flow of information.\\" On May 22, 2010, the Ambassador to the United States from Pakistan, Hussain Haqqani, formally issued a complaint to the U.S., in communications with U.S. Special Representative Richard Holbrooke. The Pakistan embassy in the United States sent a formal complaint to the U.S. Department of State. The Lahore High Court had ordered the Pakistan representative to issue the complaint to the U.S. regarding the images on Facebook. Pakistan's embassy in the U.S. told the U.S. Department of State that the images on Facebook \\"immensely hurt and discomforted the people and the government of Pakistan\\"; the embassy requested the U.S. government \\"take effective measures to prevent, stop or block this blasphemous contest immediately\\". On May 25, 2010, The Nation reported that a poll of citizens of Pakistan conducted by ProPakistani.pk revealed that 70 percent of those polled wanted Facebook to be permanently banned in the country. On May 31, 2010, PC World reported that the Lahore High Court had lifted the ban on Facebook. The magazine quoted the government of Pakistan as saying that \\"the web site had promised to make material considered derogatory inaccessible to users in Pakistan.\\" This was in line with an earlier statement by a Facebook spokeswoman, stating that Facebook \\"may consider IP blocking in Pakistan upon further review of local regulations, standards and customs\\". Pakistan's secretary of IT and telecom said in an interview that Facebook had \\"apologized\\" and agreed to block access to the page from Pakistan. Facebook had already blocked access to the page for users from India the previous week, at the request of the Indian authorities. On May 30, 2010, the day before the Facebook ban in Pakistan was lifted, Bangladesh imposed its own ban on Facebook. Justice Ijaz Chaudhry of the Lahore High Court planned to review the case on June 15, 2010 to see if Facebook had allowed more blasphemous material to be displayed. This review was postponed to July 9, 2010. MillatFacebook Millat of Millat Ibrahim (faith of Abraham) is a word used to describe the Muslim faith. Due to the block on Facebook in Pakistan, a spinoff version of the site, MillatFacebook, was created to cater primarily to Muslims. This is Pakistan's first social networking site and a writer for Agence France Presse reported in May 2010 that it had received poor reviews and drawn few adherents. Reception =Support= The idea for the May 20 protest received support from Kathleen Parker, an opinion columnist for The Washington Post: \\"Americans love their free speech and have had enough of those who think they can dictate the limits of that fundamental right. [...] Draw to any heart's discontent. It's a free country. For now.\\" The idea also received support from prominent bloggers and bloggers on prominent websites, such as Michael C. Moynihan at Reason magazine's \\"Hit & Run\\" blog, who encouraged his readers to send him their drawings.Moynihan, Michael C., \\"First Annual Everybody Draw Mohammad Day\\" , blog post, April 23, 2010, \\"Hit & Run\\" blog, Reason magazine website. Retrieved April 27, 2010. Moynihan stated he planned to select some of his favorite depictions of Muhammad from the protest movement, and then add them to the Reason.com website. Moynihan commented, \\"In the South Park episode that started all this, Buddha does lines of coke and there was an episode where Cartman started a Christian rock band that sang very homo-erotic songs. Yet there is one religious figure we can't make fun of. The point of the episode that started the controversy is that celebrities wanted Muhammad's power not to be ridiculed. How come non-Muslims aren't allowed to make jokes?\\" Moynihan posited that the decision of Comedy Central to enact self-censorship of the South Park episode would have the impact of worsening the situation. Maayana Miskin of Arutz Sheva characterized the movement as \\"a mass protest\\". Writing for The American Thinker, Ethel C. Fenig described the protest movement as a cause for freedom of speech. Westword commented positively on the protest idea, \\"Sounds like an idea we'd like to frame.\\" The editor of Family Security Matters, Pam Meister, discussed the protest movement from the perspective of freedom of speech, and commented, \\"I realize that in a free society, someone is always going to be doing or saying something that will offend somebody somewhere. I also realize that more free speech, not censorship, is the answer.\\" Andrew Mellon of Big Journalism wrote in favor of the protest movement, commenting, \\"The bottom line is that the First Amendment guarantees free speech including criticism of all peoples. We are an equal-opportunity offense country. To censor ourselves to avoid upsetting a certain group (in a cartoon no less) is un-American.\\" Mario Roy of La Presse discussed the incident, and noted, \\"it is likely that institutions will apply more and more self-censorship. Fearing a possible threat, nothing is worse than the fear of fear.\\" Writing for The American Spectator, Jeremy Lott commented positively about the protest movement: \\"While the suits at Comedy Central and Yale University Press have been cowed, people across the country have decided to speak up and thereby magnify the offense a thousandfold.\\" Helge R√∏nning, a professor at the Institute of Media and Communication at the University of Oslo, said the offense to Muslims was outweighed by freedom-of-speech concerns. \\"Indignation from those who claim the right to engage in criticism of religion is as important as the indignation that comes from the Muslim side,\\" he told the NRK (Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation). \\"I think that this is an attitude that goes deeper than whether these drawings are blasphemous or not.\\" Vebj√∏rn Selbekk, a Norwegian editor who was threatened in 2006 after he reprinted Danish cartoons of Mohammed in his publication, supported the May 20 protest. \\"I think maybe this is the right way to react‚Äîwith humor, and also to spread this number, so it isn't only a few who sit with all the threats and all the discomfort associated with defending our freedom of speech in this area,\\" he said.Vold, Henrik Brattli, \\"Alle skal tegne Muhammed\\" , article, NRK (Norsk Rikskringkasting AS‚ÄîNorwegian Broadcasting Corporation), April 26, 2010, in Norwegian (Selbekk: \\"og jeg synes kanskje dette er den riktige m√•ten √• reagere p√• ‚Äì med humor, og ogs√• √• spre dette p√• flere, s√• det ikke bare er noen f√• som blir sittende med alle truslene \\"; R√∏nning: \\"Jeg mener nok at indignasjonen fra dem som hevder retten til √• drive religionskritikk er like viktig som den indignasjonen som kommer fra den muslimske siden.

James Taranto, writing in the \\"Best of the Web Today\\" column at The Wall Street Journal, also objected to the idea, not only because depicting Mohammed \\"is inconsiderate of the sensibilities of others\\", but also because \\"it defines those others‚ÄîMuslims‚Äîas being outside of our culture, unworthy of the courtesy we readily accord to insiders.\\"Taranto, James, \\"Everybody Burn the Flag/If we don't act like inconsiderate jerks, the terrorists will have won!\\" , opinion article, The Wall Street Journal, April 26, 2010.

Bill Walsh of Bedford Minuteman wrote critically of the initiative, which seemed \\"petulant and childish\\" to him: \\"It attempts to battle religious zealotry with rudeness and sacrilege, and we can only wait to see what happens, but I fear it won‚Äôt be good.\\" Janet Albrechtsen wrote in The Australian, \\"As a cartoon, it was mildly amusing. As a campaign, it's crass and gratuitously offensive.\\" Writing for New York University's Center for Religion and Media publication, The Revealer, Jeremy F. Walton called the event a \\"blasphemous faux holiday\\", which would \\"only serve to reinforce broader American misunderstandings of Islam and Muslims\\". Franz Kruger, writing for the Mail & Guardian, called Everybody Draw Mohammed Day a \\"silly Facebook initiative\\" and found \\"the undertone of a 'clash of civilisations'\\" in it \\"disturbing\\", noting that \\"it is clear that some feel great satisfaction at what they see as 'sticking it to the Muslims'.\\" The Mail & Guardian, which had itself published a controversial cartoon of Mohammed in its pages, distanced itself from the group, noting that it \\"claimed to be a protest against restrictions on freedom of speech and religious fanaticism, but had seemingly become a forum for venting Islamophobic sentiment.\\" Hugo Rifkind, writing for The Times, called the Facebook initiative a \\"grubby project\\": \\"... there‚Äôs something here that makes me twitch. I think it‚Äôs the 'everybody'. It‚Äôs the 'everybody' of a man at the back of a mob, trying to persuade other people to get lynching. If a cartoonist wants to satirise Islam by drawing Mohammed, I‚Äôm on his side all the way. But among the 13,000 pictures on the EDMD Facebook page, you have Mohammed as a dog in a veil, Mohammed as a pig and Mohammed as a monkey. That‚Äôs not resistance, but picking a fight. Issuing a death threat against somebody who drew a picture isn‚Äôt my thing, but this isn‚Äôt either.\\" Bilal Baloch, writing for The Guardian, called the initiative \\"juvenile\\" and \\"an irresponsible poke-in-the-eye\\", while at the same time criticizing the Pakistani government's response, and calling on \\"Pakistan's Internet community to engage in an organised and compelling dialogue: if not with the offenders, then most certainly with the rest of the world that is watching.\\" In Pakistan, an editorial in Dawn, the country's oldest English-language newspaper, said that there was no doubt that the Facebook initiative \\"was in poor taste and deserving of strong condemnation,\\" adding that it was \\"debatable whether freedom of expression should extend to material that is offensive to the sensibilities, traditions and beliefs of religious, ethnic or other communities.\\" However, the editorial called the Lahore High Court's decision to block Facebook a \\"knee-jerk reaction,\\" saying that, \\"many users feel, and rightly so, that they can decide for themselves what is or is not offensive, and choose not to access material that is repugnant to their beliefs,\\" and that the block might \\"have played right into the hands of those who think nothing of displaying or publishing material that denigrates their beliefs. By reacting the way we do we only harm ourselves and, in the process, even become a subject of derision.\\" =Analysis= The protest movement and incidents surrounding the censorship of the South Park episode were discussed on the National Public Radio program, Talk of the Nation, where commentators including Ross Douthat analyzed the phenomenon of Norris withdrawing from the cartoon. Stephanie Gutmann of The Daily Telegraph wrote that she had joined the Facebook group, and commented that if the 2010 Times Square car bomb attempt was found to be related to the South Park episode \\"200\\", \\"this sort of protest will be more important than ever.\\" Writing for The Faster Times, journalist Noah Lederman noted that Norris' cartoon, \\"was her way of supporting the show‚Äôs creators and the First Amendment.\\" Writing for Financial Times, John Lloyd commented on the decision by Norris to withdraw from the protest movement and noted, \\"Molly Norris proposed a 'let‚Äôs everyone draw Mohammed day' ‚Äì then, apparently appalled by her own audacity, backed quickly away.\\" Writing for Religion Dispatches, Austin Dacey compared the protest movement to Martin Luther, stating, \\"Forget the South Park dust up; forget Everybody Draw Muhammad Day. If you want to see truly shocking anti-religious cartoons, you have to go back to the sixteenth century. Near the end of Luther‚Äôs life, his propaganda campaign against Rome grew increasingly vitriolic and his language grotesquely pungent.\\" Dacey argued, \\"The debate over cartoon depictions of the Prophet Muhammad is often framed as a clash between free speech and religious attitudes. But it is just as much a clash between conflicting religious attitudes, and the freedom at stake is not only freedom of expression but freedom of religion. For while Luther was surely engaging in offensive speech, he was also exercising a right of freedom of conscience, which included the right to dissent from Catholic orthodoxy.\\" In an analysis of the protest movement for the Daily Bruin, journalist Jordan Manalastas commented, \\"Everybody Draw Mohammed Day is a chance to reinstate offense and sincerity to their proper place, freed from terror or silence. ... The proper (and, at the risk of looking jingoistic, American) way to combat bad speech is with better speech. To silence and be silenced are the refuge of cowards.\\" In an analysis of the protest movement for Spiked, Brendan O'Neill was critical of the concept of \\"mocking Muhammad,\\" writing, \\"... these two camps ‚Äì the Muhammad-knockers and the Muslim offence-takers ‚Äì are locked in a deadly embrace. Islamic extremists need Western depictions of Muhammad as evidence that there is a new crusade against Islam, while the Muhammad- knockers need the flag-burning, street-stomping antics of the extremists as evidence that their defence of the Enlightenment is a risky, important business.\\" Several editorial cartoonists quoted by The Washington Post blogger Michael Cavna were critical of the Draw Mohammed Day idea or declined to participate, although all supported the right of cartoonists to depict Mohammed if they chose to.Michael Cavna, THEIR TURN: 12 top cartoonists offer their take on 'Draw Muhammad Day', The Washington Post blog Comics Riff (May 20, 2010). The president of the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists opposed involvement because, \\"something like that can be too easily co-opted by interest groups who, I suspect, have an agenda that goes beyond a simple defense of free expression.\\" Other cartoonists quoted in the article called the event, \\"childish and needlessly provocative,\\" or demurred because they dislike, \\"choreographed punditry.\\" Tarek Kahlaoui, an assistant professor of Islamic Art at Rutgers University, analyzed the reasons behind Islamic aniconism in an article on Global Expert Finder, pointing out that despite aniconism the depiction of Muhammad is not wholly forbidden in Islam, and so in principle it should be possible for non-Muslims to draw him as well, although stating, \\"What should be an issue, however, are all possible implications between visual representation and bigotry.\\" He also defended the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution in the way that it's an important right of all Americans. Anwar al-Awlaki Threat on Molly Norris's life, forced into hiding On July 11, 2010, it was reported that the Yemeni- American al-Qaeda cleric Anwar al-Awlaki had put Molly Norris on a hitlist. In the English version of the al-Qaeda magazine Inspire, Al-Awlaki wrote, \\"The medicine prescribed by the Messenger of Allah is the execution of those involved,\\" and was quoted as saying, > The large number of participants makes it easier for us because there are > more targets to choose from in addition to the difficulty of the government > offering all of them special protection ... But even then our campaign > should not be limited to only those who are active participants. FBI officials reportedly notified Norris warning her that they considered it a \\"very serious threat.\\" Norris has since changed her name and gone into hiding. According to the Seattle Weekly (her former employer), this decision was based on \\"the insistence of top security specialists at the FBI.\\" * The threat against Norris appeared to be renewed when Al Qaeda's Inspire included her in its March 2013 edition with eleven others in a pictorial spread entitled \\"Wanted: Dead or Alive for Crimes Against Islam,\\" and captioned, \\"Yes We Can: A Bullet A Day Keeps the Infidel Away.\\" The cartoonist St√©phane \\"Charb\\" Charbonnier was also added to Al-Qaeda's most wanted list, along with Lars Vilks and three Jyllands-Posten staff members: Kurt Westergaard, Carsten Juste, and Flemming Rose. As of 2015, Norris is still in hiding and jihadist threats against her life continue.

It is their first studio album with session drummer Mario Fabre, who replaced Charles Gavin, their last with vocalist and guitarist Paulo Miklos, who left the then quartet in 2016, and also their first release through Som Livre and producer Rafael Ramos. The album was dedicated to Rachel Sal√©m, Miklos' wife who died on July 23, 2013 of lung cancer. The album is considered a back-to-the-roots work, with Tit√£s departing from the soft, romantic and electronic arrangements from the previous album, Sacos Pl√°sticos, and returning to the heavier sound of their Cabe√ßa Dinossauro and Titanomaquia times. The lyrics are also more bitter, dealing with topics such as pedophilia, police brutality, violence against women, sexual, racial and social discrimination. In 2014, the album was nominated for the Latin Grammy Award for Best Brazilian Rock Album.  Background  Tit√£s in 2013 shooting some images of them recording \\"Cabe√ßa Dinossauro\\" for Vai que D√° Certo in S√£o Paulo. The continuous performances of Cabe√ßa Dinossauro's songs would strongly influence Nheengatu's sound. The first mention of the album dates back to as early as May 2010, just after Charles Gavin left the band. When asked about the future projects of the band, keyboardist, vocalist and bassist S√©rgio Britto stated that Tit√£s would prepare a new album in 2011. Since then, nothing was said. In the 2012-14 period, Tit√£s carried out their Futuras Instala√ß√µes (Future Installments) and Tit√£s In√©dito (Tit√£s Unseen) Tours, in which, apart from hits, they performed several new songs, for testing purposes. Some of those songs would be featured in a new album then expected for a 2012-13 release. Indeed, ten out of the 14 tracks off the album were already performed live during the aforementioned tours. Some tracks, such as \\"Morto Vivo\\" (Living Dead), which had influences of ska and guitarrada, were left out of the album. That tour was succeeded by the Cabe√ßa Dinossauro ao Vivo 2012 Tour and the celebration of the band's 30th anniversary. In March 2013, new comments suggested that the band was indeed preparing new material. While recording a new video for their song \\"Cabe√ßa Dinossauro\\" as part of the soundtrack for the Brazilian film Vai que D√° Certo, they informed M√¥nica Bergamo that they would start essaying for their new album, then expected for the second half of that year. The Cabe√ßa Dinossauro anniversary tour played a major role in defining the direction of the album. At the time, Britto commented: In that interview, the band also informed they had the intention of releasing an independent album. In November 2013, vocalist and guitarist Paulo Miklos confirmed the band would begin works on a new album in April or May 2014. At the occasion, he said the album would be \\"heavy, dirty, and mean\\". Around the same time, S√©rgio Britto stated that the band asked Andreas Kisser to produce the album, but he couldn't accept for conflicting schedules with Sepultura. Later, Britto confirmed the album would be released in early May and that the band was already recording songs on studio. In March, radio Globo FM informed that the album would be released in April via Som Livre and would feature 14 tracks. On April 16, the band announced at their official Facebook page that the album was ready and would be released in May. On 28 April, they announced the title, cover and release date for the album.  Concept  The Tower of Babel, Pieter Bruegel's painting that inspired the album cover art. The name of the album means \\"General Language\\" and is a reference to the artificial language created by the Jesuits in Brazil to ease the communication between the Indigenous peoples in Brazil and the Portuguese colonizers. As for the cover, it is based on the painting De \\"Kleine\\" Toren van Babel, by Pieter Bruegel. It depicts the Tower of Babel, a mythical tower built by men to reach the heavens, but destroyed by God's rage, which resulted in they being spread over the Earth, causing new languages to develop, thus making it difficult for different peoples to understand each other. The cover art was chosen after the album was done, via a research made by Britto. At their official Facebook announcement, the band explained: In one of the first occasions in which the band sessioned with its new formation (four members, session drummer and no other supporting musicians), Miklos came up with a manifesto of sorts, explaining how Tit√£s should be from that moment on. Each member \\"understood it in a different way\\", but the band ended up finding a common point. From there on, according to Britto, the band started to work on two ideas: \\"that we were going to make a raw rock album and that it should contain an explicit brazilianity\\". Commenting on the influence of Cabe√ßa Dinossauro on the album, guitarist Tony Bellotto explained that the moment of Brasil at the time of the album's preparation could be compared to the moment Brasil experienced at the time of Cabe√ßa Dinossauro (1986): However, he rejects that Nheengatu is a \\"back to the roots\\" album. \\"People speak through stereotypes. We didn't get back to the roots, much to the contrary. What they mean is that we did an album as relevant and seminal as some of our best past works, like Cabe√ßa Dinossauro and Titanomaquia.\\"  Lyrical themes and composing  \\"Mensageiro da Desgra√ßa\\" was based on impressions of the band about homeless and indigenous people, seen as pariahs by society. Episodes such as the assassination of the native Galdino Jesus dos Santos were sources of inspiration as well. \\"Rep√∫blica dos Bananas\\" was co-written by bassist/vocalist Branco Mello, cartoonist Angeli, o actor and director Hugo Possolo and Tit√£s' ex-session guitarist Emerson Villani. Its lyrics cover many characters that form Brazilian society. The song received a promotional video made with illustrations by Angeli himself, including depictions of himself, Tit√£s' members and the people mentioned in the lyrics. In order to write \\"Fala, Renata\\", Bellotto conceived a fictional female character inspired by early MPB songs that were named after the women covered in their own lyrics. In this case, the lyrics are about a woman that talks too much - according to Britto, who also wrote the song, it criticizes times in which \\"people talk a lot but little is said\\". Miklos, the third and final author of the song, says the lyrics pay some \\"tributes\\". One of its verses says \\"Jo√£o Luiz... Cala essa boca, porra!\\" (Portuguese for \\"Jo√£o Luiz... Shut the fuck up!\\"). Jo√£o Luiz is the real name of singer and guitarist Lob√£o. When asked if he believed that was a message for him, Lob√£o wrote the following note on his tumblr: \\"Cad√°ver Sobre Cad√°ver\\" resulted from a partnership between Miklos and the band's ex- vocalist Arnaldo Antunes. It deals with the finiteness of life. It was based on two different texts in which they were working. It was the last song to be worked on in studio. Musically, the song features some elements of indigenous music which, according to Britto, were also present in Cabe√ßa Dinossauro's title track. \\"Canalha\\", the only cover, was made with approval of its author, Walter Franco, who asked \\"the heaviest possible guitar\\". The suggestion to cover it came from Britto at the backstage of a show. Since the track was created when the Brazilian military government faced its decline, the band felt it would fit the album's purpose. Mello, who sings in this track, opted for doing it in a softer way than the original one, as if it was a \\"veiled pain\\". \\"Pedofilia\\" and \\"Flores Para Ela\\" are about violence against children and women, respectively. The first was another suggestion of Britto, and it found its inspiration in American singer Suzanne Vega's hit \\"Luka\\". In both of them, the band wanted to write the lyrics as if the people directly involved in such issues were speaking. \\"Chegada ao Brasil\\" was created through a partnership between Mello and theater director Aderbal Freire, with whom he and Newton Moreno (another director) worked on a play called Jacinta, which had a passage about an arrival in Brazil. The track also features some Brazilian elements that the band wanted to add to the album. \\"Eu Me Sinto Bem\\" features lyrics that fall out of the general scope of the album, so the band \\"compensated\\" this by adding frevo and ska rhythms to keep its brazilianity. \\"N√£o Pode\\" was inspired by orders given by Britto to his children and his dog, many of which he admits to have no meaning at all, being mere exercises of power. \\"Senhor\\" is a \\"reverse prayer\\" in which a man asks God for things that aren't normally asked for in prayers. It is a criticism to the exploitation of people from certain religious groups, and to their interference on scientific matters. \\"Bai√£o de Dois\\" was named like this by Bellotto because it was based on two sentences related to samba: \\"O Mundo √© um Moinho\\" (The World is a Windmill), a verse by Cartola; and \\"A Vida √© um Buraco\\" (Life is a Hole), the title of a Pixinguinha show. The track also cites otheer Brazilian songs. \\"Quem S√£o os Animais\\" deals with the habit of using animal names to offend other people, such as \\"veado\\" or \\"macaco\\".  Critical reception  Nheengatu received generally positive reviews from music critics, with all of them drawing comparisons with the band's older albums (specially Cabe√ßa Dinossauro, Jesus N√£o Tem Dentes no Pa√≠s dos Banguelas and Titanomaquia). Bernardo Araujo from O Globo labeled the album as \\"great\\" and called it \\"one of the most well performed Tit√£s' albums, and certanily the best in many years\\". He also praised the album's sound, which is, according to him, reminiscent of Cabe√ßa Dinossauro, Jesus n√£o Tem Dentes no Pa√≠s dos Banguelas, Tudo Ao Mesmo Tempo Agora and Titanomaquia. Commenting on the lyrics, he said: \\"Pedophilia, prejudice, racism, poverty, drugs... there's no thorny topic that doesn't pass through this Nheengatu album's lyrics.\\" Leonardo Rodrigues from UOL M√∫sica said the album \\"might be the last great Tit√£s album - or just the first of a new phase\\". Commenting on the band's line-up, he stated the group found in it \\"their best studio album since the 1995 Domingo.\\" He praised the heaviness of \\"Fardado\\" (which he saw as an upgrade on \\"Pol√≠cia\\"), \\"Pedofilia\\", \\"Bai√£o de Dois\\" and \\"Senhor\\". Julio Maria of O Estado de S. Paulo labeled the album as \\"strong\\" and praised the album for its unobvious metrics, while the melodies \\"demand two auditions, when they penetrate forever\\". He also stated that \\"here, Tit√£s take down a prejudice that was growing strong with every album released by an eighties' band: the idea that the strength or rock and roll had its days numbered, and that nobody above their 35s could make it as they did at their twenties.\\" Claudio Dirani, at 89 FM a R√°dio Rock, called Nheengatu the \\"best national rock album in the last 20 years\\". Andr√© Rrodrigues of the Brazilian edition of Rolling Stone considered Nheengatu Tit√£s' best album in years and also heard similarities with Cabe√ßa Dinossauro and Titanomaquia. He concluded his reviews by saying: \\"Nheengatu is a punch in the face from the beginning to the end\\". Regis Tadeu at Yahoo! News Brazil called Nheengatu a \\"beautiful album, specially coming from a group that had reached the bottom of the well in artistic terms with their two previous albums\\". He also pointed the absence of ballads and called its words \\"straight and aggressive\\". Omelete's Kaluan Bernardo called the album \\"good, sincere and urgent\\" and stated that Tit√£s are the \\"true survivors\\" (in reference to the line \\"quem vive sobrevive\\", from the track \\"Cad√°ver Sobre Cad√°ver\\", which translates as \\"who lives survives\\") for them being still active even after losing half its members and being neglected after Sacos Pl√°sticos.

It was inspired by blogger Jennifer McCreight. Inception The Boobquake rally served to protest news reports of controversial beliefs espoused by Hojatoleslam Kazem Seddiqi, an Islamic religious authority in Iran. Seddiqi blamed women who dress immodestly for causing earthquakes. On April 19, it was reported that Seddiqi advised his listeners that \\"Many women who do not dress modestly lead young men astray, corrupt their chastity and spread adultery in society, which increases earthquakes\\" and Iranians should \\"adapt their lives to Islam's moral codes\\" to avoid being \\"buried under the rubble\\". In response to Seddiqi's comments, a blogger named Jennifer McCreight invited people to dress \\"in your immodest clothing to represent Boobquake.\\"Boobquake Facebook Event She described Boobquake as a scientific experiment: \\"With the power of our scandalous bodies combined, we should surely produce an earthquake. If not, I'm sure Sedighi can come up with a rational explanation for why the ground didn't rumble.\\"Boobquake on Facebook McCreight's idea was popularized by prominent blogs and soon caught the attention of the international media. The event also drew criticism from people seeing it as objectifying women. Following repeated inquiries from the BBC and other news agencies, McCreight planned two meetings for participants: one in West Lafayette, Indiana, and one in Washington, D.C. Soon, what originated as \\"a humorous exercise in scientific and skeptical thinking\\" had begun to ignite serious debate regarding the organization of the feminist community. Inspiration Jennifer McCreight participating in Boobquake The inpiration for this event was Jennifer McCreight, who attributes her activism to reading Richard Dawkins' book The God Delusion and attending a relatively religious college. While working on her undergraduate degree she had co-founded the Society of Non-Theists at Purdue. One year prior to Boobquake, McCreight had begun keeping a blog in which she described herself as an atheist and a feminist. On April 19, McCreight announced a protest against Seddiqi's comments on her blog, asking for participants to avoid \\"hateful or anti-Muslim or anti-Iranian messages\\".The Epicenter: Boobquake West Lafayette Facebook event In the week leading up to Boobquake, McCreight received several emails from \\"thankful skeptics, feminists, and Iranians\\". Event Organizers at the Dupont Circle Boobquake An estimated total of 200,000 people participated in Boobquake on April 26, 2010. The so-called \\"epicenter\\" of Boobquake was a light-hearted two-hour gathering at 1:00 pm at the Purdue Bell Tower in West Lafayette, Indiana. Participants' attire included push-up bras, unbuttoned shirts, short dresses, as well as other \\"racy costumes\\" and \\"risqu√© clothing\\". They also held signs with slogans such as \\"Cleavage for Science\\", \\"Amnesty\\", and \\"God hates Boobs\\". Purdue's student newspaper reported that the female participants were outnumbered by male spectators. Washington, D.C.'s Dupont Circle was the site of another gathering at noon. The Washington gathering was attended by a dozen women and drew the attention of BBC Persia. Other notable gatherings were reported in New York City and Vancouver. In Vancouver, it was reported that most attendees at the event were hundreds of men using camera phones to take pictures, especially of a small number of women who were topless. Some people also supported the event by purchasing official \\"Boobquake 2010\\" T-shirts through Zazzle.com. The proceeds from the shirts went to the Red Cross, to benefit earthquake recovery, and to the James Randi Educational Foundation, to support critical thinking. Evaluation That morning, at 10:59 am (2:59 am GMT or 10:59 pm on April 25, Indiana time - 10 hours after Boobquake Indiana; 9 hours after the Washington Dupont circle event), a 6.5-magnitude earthquake struck 195 miles off the coast of Taitung, Taiwan, at a depth of 6.2 miles. Upon hearing of this, McCreight said that it alone was not statistically significant, but that she would continue to monitor seismic activity for the next 24 hours. Other participants mentioned that the earthquake in Taiwan occurred early in the morning, prior to the official start of the experiment. After April 26 had ended in all time zones, McCreight began to conduct rigorous statistical analysis. McCreight pointed out that dozens of earthquakes occur daily, and that the goal of her analysis was not to see if all seismic activity would cease, but to determine whether the number or severity of earthquakes increased during the experiment. By compiling data from the USGS website, McCreight determined a 95% confidence interval of zero to 148 daily earthquakes. During the course of the Boobquake event, only 47 earthquakes were reported. She also calculated that an earthquake of the magnitude of that in Taiwan had a 37% chance of occurring on that day. McCreight also said that the mean magnitude of seismic activity during the \\"Boobquake\\" event was actually slightly below average. As a result of this analysis, McCreight concluded that the immodest clothing worn during Boobquake had no significant effect on earthquake frequency or magnitude. Although McCreight admitted that there were some flaws with the experimental procedure, and that she doubted it would have any impact on Seddiqi's opinions, she believed that the event fulfilled its original intentions of being \\"a humorous exercise in scientific and skeptical thinking\\". Responses = Support among expatriate Iranians = The event drew a favorable response from several expatriate Iranian political activists, including Mina Ahadi of the International Committee Against Executions and Stoning and Maryam Namazie of Iran Solidarity both of whom are members of the Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain. These activists felt that Boobquake was a significant act in the defense of women's rights and human dignity. They said that many Iranian citizens supported Boobquake in its opposition to Sedighi's views, which they believe to be representative of the Iranian government of the past three decades. Kazem Sedighi defended his statements in a new sermon on May 14, 2010. When asked why there are not more natural disasters in western nations that do not follow his moral codes, Sedighi answered that God occasionally allows people to continue sinning \\"so that they (eventually) go to the bottom of Hell.\\" It was not reported whether or not Sedighi specifically mentioned Boobquake during this sermon. = Brainquake and objectification of women = A feminist critique and response to Boobquake was the brainchild of Golbarg Bashi, who created a counter- movement known as \\"Brainquake\\" in April 2010.Brainquake Fan page Bashi, a feminist professor of Iranian Studies at Rutgers and some other feminists were critical of Boobquake's method of drawing attention to questions about gender in Iran which they believed further victimized and objectified women and girls. Bashi, who conceived of the idea, stated that Boobquake was essentially another white liberal \\"post-feminist\\" spectacle at the expense of women's struggles in Iran. Negar Mottahedeh, a Duke University professor, managed Brainquake's social media activities in 2010. Bashi explained the disproportionate interest in Boobquake as opposed to major feminist campaigns in Iran as such: \\"Our usual boob-crazed, I mean civilized male-dominated mass media went potty over this 'eye-ran' (read as Iran) related campaign, turned it into a major international story and thousands of (mostly) men joined McCreight's 'Boobquake' Facebook event. It was in this context that Brainquake began as an Iranian counter feminist initiative to save the discourse on women's rights from being used as another spectacle and provide visual reference to Iranian women's own century long feminist struggles against sexism.\\" Planned for the same day as Boobquake, Brainquake was initially a Facebook event registered, composed and managed by Bashi. Brainquake's Facebook event encouraged women to demonstrate their \\"abilities to push for change\\" by showing off their r√©sum√©s, CVs, honors, prizes, and accomplishments. In this way, Bashi and her fellow feminist activists hoped to provide a visual reference to Iranian women's own century long feminist struggles against sexism. Later in Spring 2010, Brainquake's event page was turned into a fan page and has since become a portal on news and commentary on global women's issues with a particular emphasis on leftist causes. Brainquake has retained its initial goal of providing a comprehensive visual reference to Iranian women's movements and also a pictorial dictionary to many issues and campaigns that identify and fight against all kinds of violence and discrimination against women and girls and other minorities in the United States of America, Europe, and elsewhere. These photo albums and the reliable links and information that accompany them are part of Brainquake's feminist consciousness raising effort for a mass public. = Other notable responses = Russell Blackford, of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies, fully supported the idea of Boobquake, saying, \\"There is nothing wrong with the beauty of the human body, male or female, nothing wrong with enjoying it, and nothing wrong with displaying it to the world.\\" Blackford encouraged participants to \\"Strut your stuff, and don't let anyone make you feel ashamed about so-called 'immodesty'. Feel free to scorn the moralism of Islamic clerics and anyone else who tries to put you down.\\" In response to feminists' disagreements over Boobquake and Brainquake, some asked, \\"Why not both?\\". Melody Moezzi, for example, writing for the blog of Ms., saw no reason for there to be any conflict between the two events. Moezzi believed that there should be no problem with having multiple means of discrediting \\"the leaders of the so-called Islamic Republic of Iran\\", and suggested that women participate in both events. McCreight herself subsequently observed that some atheists acted misogynistically towards her and other women, partly in reaction to the joke in Boobquake's name, and she has called for a greater respect for feminism and a more welcoming culture in the atheism movement.

BRILL In his work, Heraclitus defended Homer against those who denounced him for his immoral portrayals of the gods. Heraclitus based his defense of Homer on allegorical interpretation. He gives interpretations of major episodes from the Iliad and the Odyssey, particularly those that received the greatest criticism, such as the battles between the gods and the love affair between Aphrodite and Ares. Many of his allegories are physical, claiming that the poems represent elemental forces; or ethical, that they contain edifying concealed messages. An important example of physical allegory is Heraclitus' interpretation of the love affair between Aphrodite and Ares. He argues that Aphrodite and Ares represent Love and Strife, the forces responsible for the mixture and separation of the elements in Empedocles' philosophy, which were \\"united together after their ancient rivalry {philoneikia} in one accord\\".Stephen Trzaskoma, R.

It has been suggested that and believed by many local citizens to be an area with a long history of battling environmental injustice. History Since the mid-19th century, the Rogers-Eubanks Community has been home to many African-American families. A great deal of the black-owned family farmland in this area has been passed down throughout the generations. Rogers Road was originally a wagon-track in the late 19th century, and Eubanks Road contained a small school founded by a former slave. The school provided an education for the neighborhood's black children in a time when they had no such opportunities. In current times, the Rogers-Eubanks Community has maintained its rich culture despite being the host to mainly low-income households. The social bonds among the families that formed their roots over 100 years ago have been crucial to the ability of the residents to battle the county and achieve environmental equality. An organization called Play Street Soccer, an affiliate of the Chapel Hill and Carrboro Human Rights Center, also hosts pick up soccer games for the youth of the area once each week. The organization began hosting games in the spring of 2011 with the hope of empowering children and building community through soccer. Dumping disputes =Orange County's growing problem= From 1939 to 1979, many new families moved into this historically small neighborhood, buying houses and land and establishing themselves in the area surrounding Rogers Road. Just like most of Orange County at the time, the Rogers-Eubanks Community was moving away from being a small group of tight-knit families and moving toward rapid expansion. Aside from changing the nature of the community, there was one other problem that the county was not well-prepared to solve: garbage. More people equals more garbage, but in the 1970s, the political scene was active and a lot of change was beginning to happen. Along with the formation of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in December 1970, the American people were becoming concerned with inflation, racial tensions, conservation, and pollution. This new-found national interest in preserving the environment \\"called into question the common practice of burning household waste and disposing of waste into‚Ä¶waterways.\\" All of these national concerns were equally existent in Orange County. The issue of race was prominent in Orange High School where many black students were accused of \\"carrying weapons, insulting white female students, and passing out literature\\" at school. The school emblem was changed from the \\"black panther\\" and ' 'Dixie' ' was no longer allowed to be played at the school's football games due to its racial associations. =The promises of Howard Lee and Orange County, 1970= The racially charged area was still in need of a place to put its rapidly growing volume of refuse. The mayor at the time was a man named Howard Lee. Howard Lee was elected in 1969 and was the first African-American to be elected as mayor in a southern, mostly white area since reconstruction. In 1970, the Orange County Board of County Commissioners (BOCC) discussed a solution to the growing waste problem as the county's existing landfills were nearing capacity more and more each day. The search for a piece of land on which to locate the new landfill began in 1971. Various sites were considered and the initial decision had been to locate the landfill in Chestnut Ridge, but at some point between June 8 and June 29, 1972, the site was dropped and changed to a site on Eubanks Road (then State Road 1727) where it still remains. Despite his plans and promises to \\"prevent zoning decisions from being influenced by considerations of wealth, race, or political influence\\", Lee was under the pressures of time, progress, and space, making it difficult to ensure such equality. There was a great deal of protest before the landfill was built on the Eubanks Road site by both individual citizens and community groups. One such group was the New Hope Improvement Association, an organization led by John L. Kline that consisted of roughly 500 members living in the area surrounding the proposed site. Lawyer B.B. Olive from Durham aided the group in their struggle, and although the team failed to prevent the construction of the landfill, Olive is remembered as one of the biggest advocates against the landfill. The County Commissioners were at a loss after losing Chestnut Ridge as an option and now facing opposition and protest from the residents living near the site on Eubanks Road. After a denial of the rezoning of the site from \\"residential\\" to \\"rural industrial\\", the New Hope Improvement Association was excited and tried to boost the force against the landfill's creation on Eubanks Road by filing a legal complaint against the county, Right before this legal battle was to be fought, Mayor Howard Lee visited the community and said: \\"We want to put a landfill out here. To do it, we're going to pave your road. When the landfill is full, we're going to turn it into a recreation center for you.\\" Having convinced the families that this may be beneficial, Lee singlehandedly weakened his opposition and eventually, despite the community being one that was \\"strongly opposed to having a landfill near them\\", the unlined landfill was built on of land on Eubanks Road in 1972. =Widening the divide= In late 1980s, the county announced that there would be an expansion of the landfill rather than the promised shutdown and recreational facilities. David Caldwell, Judy Nunn Snipes, and B.B. Olive led a new activist group in the 90s in response to the proposed actions and demanded a shutdown of the landfill and compensation for having hosted the facility for the promised number of years. The county had known almost a decade earlier in the late 70s that the need to expand would be an issue in future years. Once the citizens were informed, there was internal debate among citizens and officials within the county. Many arguments of the injustice were made, and the residents of the Rogers Road coalition believed that the areas creating the waste were not the ones hosting the facilities for that waste, a fact that they hoped would change. =What now?= Many of the black residents felt as though they had been completely neglected by the government and betrayed and fooled by their mayor, the person who was supposed to be their advocate, not their enemy. One of the main reasons the dump hadn't been located in Chestnut Ridge was to avoid creating dangers for the children who attended a nearby year-round camp, yet so many families in the Rogers-Eubanks community feel that their neighborhood is family-oriented aside from the landfill and that their children's health is being negatively affected. Upon hearing that the government was planning on placing a new facility in the same area, the citizens were outraged. In March 2006, the county's Solid Waste Advisory Board officially recommended the Eubanks Road site as the location of the new solid waste transfer station. Having already temporarily expanded the existing landfill and ignored the people's requests for amenities, the local town governments proceeded to go behind the backs of the citizens in the Rogers Road community and give the county both control of the landfill and 60 more acres of land for the siting of a solid waste transfer station. The families in this area had already been dealing with increased truck traffic, landfill odor, deteriorating water quality, and unwanted visits from buzzards, rats, and stray dogs searching for food in the county's trash for many years, and feel that it is unfair to bear it any longer. The commissioners in Orange County have responded to the uproar from the Rogers Road residents and promised to reconsider the site, but they have yet to promise to completely wipe the Eubanks Road site off the list of possibilities. Many people in the area worry about their ancestral property. The planned facility is expected to cost $4.7 million. Water shortage The landfill, although modern for the time, was not constructed in a way that kept the area safe from the toxins and waste that leached into the ground of the surrounding area. Tests conducted in the early months of 2010 showed that only two of the eleven wells in the Rogers Road area are supplying the area's residents with water \\"within the EPA recommended limits\\". Water lines were eventually laid in the area but did not reach all the way down Rogers Road, and for many families, the hook-up fees that ran up costs of about $2,000 were out of the price range for many citizens in the area. The sewer hook-up fees were even more expensive, reaching about $3,000 per household. Despite the program set up by the county to give assistance to homeowners unable to afford these costs, many either could not afford the water bills that followed or did not fall low enough on the income bracket to be considered in need. In February 2010, Orange County Board of Commissioners unanimously passed a resolution that is expected to plan a way to provide safe and clean water options for households located within of the landfill. If the plan comes to fruition, possible solutions include fixing and replacing existing wells or give the residents access to the county's public water supply by extending the lines. The residents seem hopeful that the government will choose to extend the water supply rather than simply repair the wells. =Possible health hazards= People in the neighborhood have questioned the safety of the water since shortly after the landfill was first built in the 70s. Many noticed their loved ones coming down with cancer among other sicknesses and a change of the color of the water in which their families drank, cooked with, and bathed in. The government denied any allegations from the start that it was a result of the landfill and as a result felt no obligation to give them the amenities which they lacked. Contaminants have been found in tests done on some of the wells in the area around the Orange County Regional Landfill. Vinyl Chloride, tetrachloroethylene,dichloroethene, and benzene are all chemicals that could cause health problems in high doses. The concentration of vinyl chloride was found to be 16 mg/l when the regulations state the acceptable range to be 0.002 mg/l-0.015 mg/l. Dichloroethene also exceeds the standards, found at a concentration of 232 mg/l when the accepted level falls at 70 mg/l. Additionally, the benzene was discovered to exist at a level of 7 mg/l when it should not be any greater than 1 mg/l. The health effects of these chemicals are said to be dangerous if long-term exposure occurs. Lack of data to prove that the chemicals have affected the health is what maintains the rift between the beliefs of the citizens and those of the local government. Government involvement The government has been trying to make amends in recent years, but many residents of the area see these changes as superficial attempts at \\"patching\\" the problem and not really fixing the source of all of the issues that the area faces. A huge problem with the legislation is that Rogers Road has only some parts within city limits but other parts are transition areas between Carrboro and Chapel Hill known as \\"extraterritorial planning jurisdiction.\\" This has allowed for a great deal of neglect as no one wants to take responsibility for the area that is not within the drawn city lines. In December 2006, the town of Chapel Hill began developing the Rogers Road Small Area Plan. This plan is designed to provide a \\"more detailed look at the impacts of providing public services in the area, especially the extension of sanitary sewer, and the impacts of developing an affordable housing site.\\" It also serves as an outlet to analyze \\"desirable land uses and revision to the land use plan water and sewer extension plan, roadway network, bicycle and pedestrian facilities plan, transit service plan, zoning ordinance and map amendment.\\" This plan affects the Greene Tract, an area containing Chapel Hill, Carrboro, and other parts of Orange County. Many residents fear the loss of ancestral property in relation to this plan as well. Related government action has started to be taken to aid communities like the Rogers-Eubanks Community. In September 2007, Senator Hillary Clinton introduced a bill titled the Environmental Justice Renewal Act. Despite the efforts to aid poverty-struck areas, some advocates, like African American Environmentalist Association (AAEA) president Norris McDonald, feel that bills like the EJRA are insufficient and just strategic political moves to gain votes. The idea that this was an instance of racial discrimination really started to flourish in the first decade of the 21st century. In Oct 2007, Reverend Robert Campbell, \\"one of the town's leading activists for environmental justice in the Rogers Road community\\" filed a complaint with the EPA in reference to the Rogers-Eubanks Community claiming that county officials had \\"violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\\" and the regulations set by the EPA that prohibited discrimination. The mention of the lengthy history of such behavior, groundwater contamination, and the lack of sewer and water lines were also discussed. Reverend Campbell's complaint that he filed \\"with the Department of Justice about the siting of the transfer station\\" is not agreed upon by local government officials. The county's commissioner Barry Jacobs said that the decision was in no way a matter of racial or socioeconomic discrimination and that he is \\"thinking about\\" considering other sites. Having gained a great deal of national attention, the Rogers-Eubanks community coalition ensure that it became an issue in the 2007 elections, hoping that incoming politicians will see it as an issue needing repair. Reverend Robert Campbell was invited to the \\"Obama Administration's green energy table\\" and went in hopes of gaining a commitment for federal stimulus money to improve the water and air quality of his neighborhood. He traveled to the White House and spoke to EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson and Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius about the issues facing the Rogers-Eubanks Community. Hoping to influence policy change, discuss a national campaign for reducing, reusing, and recycling, and the suggest the expansion of testing and forming infrastructure, Rev. Campbell had great hopes for the meeting after the great response to the grant he had submitted to the EPA. The Reverend feels that if money were available, the issues of air, sewage, and water could be dealt with properly. Rogers-Eubanks \\"Coalition to End Environmental Racism\\" (CEER) Founded in 2007, the Rogers-Eubanks Coalition to End Environmental Racism, often abbreviated as CEER, has a three part mission. The first part is to undo the recent decision of Orange County to locate a new waste transfer center in their community. The second is to restore just health and safety in the areas surrounding the Orange County Landfill. The third part of their mission is to make heard the concerns of local residents, and to provide them with healthy and safe water. The group was brought together through grass roots efforts, yet in the two and a half years since it was founded, many other organizations have taken an interest to the cause. Some of these include the Chapel Hill/Carrboro branch of the NAACP, the Women's league of Peace and Freedom and the students and faculty of the University of North Carolina. Like almost any other environmental justice movement, the involvement of outside groups is likely to continue to be a huge aid in the fight for the Rogers-Eubanks Community against Orange County and its new waste transfer station. = Ineffective to influential? = On September 20, 2007, this mission was very clearly laid out in a memorandum from the Solid Waste Director to the County manager over a span of approximately fourteen months. After five meetings, the Rogers-Eubanks community had twenty-six points on their \\"Wish List for Enhancement\\". These points are quite varied but not the least bit unreasonable, such as finding an alternate site for the Waste Transfer Station, provide municipal water for those who did not get it the first time, reduce the odor surrounding us, and stop dividing Rover-Eubanks as a community. In the September 24, 2007 issue of the Daily Tar Heel, a resident of the Rogers-Eubanks community was quoted saying, \\"Most of us feel we're not being heard,\\" and that they, \\"just aren't getting a strong feel that what we're saying is going to make a difference.\\" However that Thursday, more than 40 residents and members of CEER attended the Assembly of Government meeting, where it is usually policy to not let representatives speak. However at this meeting, Neloa Jones was given the floor and allowed to make a speech about the promises that had been broken for the past thirty-five years. During her heartfelt speech, Jones was quoted saying, \\"I don't know if people understand what it's like to live beside a landfill for 35 years.\\" This statement brings a lot into perspective, reminding outsiders that the garbage is not just an inconvenience; it is a huge detriment to the quality of life of members of the Rogers Road community. \\"I guess all that noise we've been making, somebody listened,\\" said the Rev. Robert Campbell on Saturday November 14, in reference to his invitation to the White House. He had a chance to discuss the environmental and physical health of his community with EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson and Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. The Reverend was invited because he is one of the co-founders / co-chairs of CEER, is a prominent figure in the environmental justice movement and is president of the Rogers- Eubanks Neighborhood Association. He says the main issue with his community is lack of funding, and his goal is to get more funding so more positive steps can be taken to clean up the Rogers-Eubanks community. However, despite the recent change to these positive events, the water quality of the poor neighborhoods in the Rogers Road community is as bad as ever. According to a recent water and ground test, 9 of the 11 wells servicing the community are contaminated and do not meet EPA standards. For over thirty-five years the citizens have been fighting the filth put into their community, and it appears that their struggle is not over yet. =Coalition officers & committee chairs= *Neloa Jones ‚Äì Co-Chair *Rev.

Its main advantage relative to Allan variance is its ability to separate white phase noise from flicker phase noise. The modified Allan deviation (MDEV), also known as mod œÉy(œÑ), is the deviation variant of the modified Allan variance. Background The Allan variance has a drawback in that it is unable to separate the white phase modulation (WPM) from the flicker phase modulation (FPM). Looking at their response to Power- law noise it is clearly seen that WPM and FPM have almost the same response to tau, but WPM is linearly sensitive to the system bandwidth fH whereas FPM is only weakly dependent on it. Thus, by varying the system bandwidth the WPM and FPM noise forms may be separated. However, it is impractical to alter the hardware of the measurement system. By post-processing the sample-series and implementing a software bandwidth a modified Allan variance measure can be given capable of resolving the noise forms.

Kern Transportation Foundation. Produced by: White Bear Enterprises, 2008. Located at the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley, the county is at a prime location to ship goods west to the central coast, south to ports in Los Angeles, and east to corridors that connect to the rest of the country. It is also on major corridors that link to all northern points. State Routes in Kern County. Shown with Centennial Corridor currently under construction. Intercity Highways Kern County is served by a large network of highways, expressways and freeways. It is easier to break the network down into three categories: primary, alternate, and local. It is also easier to view Bakersfield as the center of the transportation network, and the routes traveling away from that point. They are listed below, with the names either officially designated by the state, or commonly used by local authorities and Caltrans. Primary routes are the mainline highways connecting Bakersfield with major destinations and other major transportation infrastructure. Alternate routes are other routes that connect major destinations and other major transportation infrastructure, but do not require travel on the primary route. The exception is SR 58 (Mojave Freeway), which is a primary route and part of the alternate route to I-5 (Golden State Freeway). The reason is SR 58 and SR 14 are both mostly freeways and are capable of handling large semi-trucks. Local routes are the remaining state routes. They primarily connect local roads and rural communities to primary and alternate routes. Although Kern County is located at the center of an important interstate highway system, it is only served by one interstate (I-5). Ironically this interstate bypasses many important transportation hubs and connectors in the valley, currently served by state routes (SR 99 and SR 58). This includes the two largest cities not served by an interstate, which are Fresno and Bakersfield. Efforts have been made for inclusion of the other two routes into the interstate system. SR 99 has been designated a NHS future interstate, which would either be number I-7 or I-9. Currently Caltrans and the Federal Highway Administration are negotiating what needs to be upgraded to conform to interstate standards. SR 58 is currently being converted to a freeway, but has not been submitted for future interstate status. If adopted, it would be an extension of I-40 which currently terminates in Barstow, CA. Currently about 65% of truck traffic which use the route does cross the California state line.Report for SR-58 Origiand Destination Truck Study . KernCOG. Page 7, 9.

Both railroads parallel each other north of Bakersfield through the San Joaquin Valley. Within the county, Union Pacific follows SR 99, while BNSF follows SR 43. The distance between the two railroads average about 16 miles. South of Bakersfield, both railroads must use the route over the Tehachapi Mountains.

At one time, a railroad line connected Bakersfield and the oil rich City of Taft, known as the Sunset Railway. However, the construction of oil pipelines and equipment being hauled by trucks resulted in the removal of the route. Passenger service is provided exclusively by the San Joaquin Route, run by Amtrak California. North of Bakersfield the train uses the BNSF route through the valley. The line terminates in Bakersfield, where passengers transfer to one of five Amtrak Thruway bus routes.

Bakersfield is served by three major freeways and two minor freeways. State Route 99 is the north‚Äìsouth route, running through the entire length of the city, just east of downtown. It is also the mainline connecting Bakersfield with interstate routes in Sacramento and Los Angeles. State Route 178 connects east and northeast Bakersfield with downtown. However, it ends at the east end of downtown, approximately 1.5 miles from SR 99. State Route 58 is the mainline connecting Bakersfield with Interstates 15 and 40, which are major routes that serve the rest of the country. Since the route mostly travels along the southern edge of the city, it generally does not see as much intracity traffic as SR 99 and SR 178. Currently there is no state-maintained freeway in west Bakersfield. However, the Westside Parkway is currently being constructed parallel to Stockdale Highway and the Kern River as a local freeway (built to Caltrans standards). The Centennial Corridor project (which the Westside Parkway is a part of) will connect the freeway to SR 58, creating the first continuous east‚Äìwest freeway to span the width of Bakersfield. Eventually, the freeway will be extended west to I-5. Bakersfield is also served by two minor freeways. State Route 204 (Golden State Avenue) is built as a four-lane freeway from SR 99 to F Street, a length of about 1.4 miles. This provides an alternate route for traffic from SR 178 and downtown to northwest Bakersfield and SR 99 north. The other freeway is Alfred Harrell Highway, which connects northeast Bakersfield to Hart Park and the rest of the Kern River County Park. Additional right of way was reserved to extend the freeway east to SR 178, but there are currently no plans for construction. =Intracity rail= Southern Pacific's station sits idle in East Bakersfield. Office portion still used by Union Pacific. BNSF and Union Pacific have major yards located within Bakersfield. BNSF is located in downtown Bakersfield. Because of a land dispute between Southern Pacific (later merged with Union Pacific) and the City of Bakersfield in 1874, the railroad built its line five miles east in Sumner (later annexed by Bakersfield and renamed East Bakersfield).Lynch, George.The Streetcars, Gone but not Forgotten . The Bakersfield Californian. Retrieved April 26, 2010. Since Amtrak only runs on BNSF tracks, one station is used in downtown Bakersfield. Prior to Amtrak, both railroads had passenger rail service. The Southern Pacific station was located at the intersection of Sumner and Baker streets in East Bakersfield. The need for transportation between the two stations resulted in the first street car line being built to connect them in 1888. It was also the last line to be removed when street car line was discontinued and removed. =Street layout= Bakersfield arterial streets are laid out in a grid pattern, running north‚Äìsouth and east‚Äìwest. In central Bakersfield, collectors are also laid out in a grid pattern parallel to the arterials. In East Bakersfield, since the streets were laid out by Southern Pacific, they ran parallel to their railroad tracks, which is about 45 degrees off from the rest of the city. In older sections of southwest Bakersfield, developers used the neighborhood design, where developments were laid out on arterials behind brick walls. Collectors followed curved paths through large tracts of land. Few streets would connect to arterials for each development. This created a maze of streets, where a resident could walk for miles, before being able to leave the development. However, later developments throughout the city created a more direct path for pedestrians to exit. =Bus transportation= Public transportation in the Greater Bakersfield area is provided exclusively by Golden Empire Transit. There are two transit hubs: Downtown Transit Center and Valley Plaza Transit Center. A network of 18 routes traverses Bakersfield and serves many local attractions. These include: Northwest Promenade, Bakersfield Museum of Art (and Mill Creek), Kern County Museum, and Valley Plaza. Transportation is available to Meadows Field. However, unlike Kern Regional Transit, direct transportation to the Amtrak station is not provided.Maps. Golden Empire Transit. Retrieved April 29, 2010. =Cycling= Bakersfield contains two bike trails. The primary trail (and the longest) is the Kern River Bike Trail. It is located in the Kern River Parkway and runs from China Grade Loop (west of Hart Park) to Enos Lane (east of I-5). The bike path follows the Kern River for its entire length. In addition, there are a couple of spur routes off of the bike path. One is located at Cal State Bakersfield, and the other is near The Park at River Walk. The other shorter bike trail is in Kern River County Park. It runs from the east side of Hart Park to the east side of the Kern River Golf Course; at the large reservable picnic area.Bakersfield Metro Area . South Valley Bicycle Coalition. Retrieved April 29, 2010. In addition, many arterials and collectors in Bakersfield contain a bike lane. The distance from the curb varies depending on whether there is on street parking. GET buses contain bike racks on the front of their buses and Amtrak has bike racks on the trains. =On foot= In recent years, several projects have been undertaken that are making Bakersfield a much more pedestrian friendly city. The largest project is Mill Creek, in downtown. The Kern Island Canal, which runs through eastern downtown, was modified to resemble a natural creek. A path, with artistic landscaping, and decorative lighting was added along sides of the canal. The total length of the project is approximately 1.5 miles long.Mill Creek, A Downtown Master Plan. City of Bakersfield. Retrieved April 29, 2010. There has also been a variety of streetscape projects conducted throughout downtown. These include installing decorative lighting, planting trees, and decorative concrete. In addition to downtown, there are many other areas throughout Bakersfield friendly to walkers. Many trails exist throughout the Kern River Parkway, and the foothills in northeast Bakersfield. The Park at River Walk in the southwest, and Panorama County Park (on the Panorama Bluffs) in the northeast, are also popular places for walkers. Most new developments, primarily in the northwest and southwest, have created shaded, winding sidewalks adjacent to arterials. Future =Kern County= SR 58, 46, and 65 are all in the process, or planned to be, converted to a minimum of a 4-lane expressway. SR 58 is the closest to being completed, with only two segments remaining (both outside of Kern County). The first segment has started on SR 46, with the total project expected to take a minimum of 20 years. SR 65, the shortest highway to be converted within Kern County, is not scheduled to start construction on its first segment until at least 2025.2007 Destination 2030 Regional Transportation Plan . KernCOG. May 17, 2007. Retrieved April 26, 2010. In addition, Kern County has proposed constructing an intermodal facility near Meadows Field. Its purpose is to allow the easy transfer of goods from one mode of transportation to another. The location is close to air with Meadows Field, rail with Union Pacific mainline, and road with State Route 99. It would also be located in the midst of Bakersfield‚Äôs growing industrial center. In the future, SR 58 and SR 46 may be considered for a possible westward expansion of Interstate 40 via SR 58 from Barstow to Bakersfield, from Bakersfield to I-5 via Westside Parkway, and then following SR 46 to Paso Robles. =Greater Bakersfield= Bakersfield has had the challenge of its freeways not connecting to each other and west Bakersfield. The Westside Parkway provides the western freeway and the Centennial Corridor will connect it to SR 58. The last connection, which is currently not listed as a future project, will be to connect SR 178 to the Westside Parkway. When the freeway is considered, most likely at least two routes will be studied, since both have been recommended in past reports. One would travel west through downtown and Westchester, while the other would travel south through southern downtown near the BNSF railroad yard.Progress Report 2008/2009. TRIP (Thomas Roads Improvement Program). Page 7. In addition, future projects on SR 204 (Golden State Avenue) will construct an interchange at F Street and reconfigure ramps at SR 178. These changes, combined with the existing interchange at Garces Circle, would most likely result in extending the freeway to SR 178. Bakersfield also identified a network of beltways, which would route traffic around the outer parts of town. These beltways would be initially built as expressways, and later converted to freeways as traffic increases. Currently three beltways are being considered. The West Beltway would run north‚Äìsouth from Seventh Standard Road to Taft Highway. It will run parallel to Heath Road to the north and parallel to South Allen Road to the south. A future extension would connect the West Beltway to SR 99 and I-5, providing a bypass to Bakersfield. The South Beltway would run east‚Äìwest from SR 58 to I-5. From SR 58, it would run south, parallel to Comanche Drive, until Taft Highway. From there, the freeway would turn west and run parallel to Taft Highway until terminating at I-5. The East Beltway would run from SR 58 north to Morning Drive. North of SR 178, the route would most likely follow the existing Alfred Harrell Highway. =Light rail= Bakersfield has considered constructing a light rail system within the city. The proposed route would run from Cal State Bakersfield in the southwest to Bakersfield College in the northeast. It would travel on surface streets, and run through many populated parts of the city, including: southwest, downtown, east Bakersfield, and northeast. A study conducted in 1998 concluded that Bakersfield was not dense enough to justify the expense. However, the study did indicate that the city was large enough to justify an express bus system. A light rail system could be phased in, first constructing stations for the bus system, and later adding tracks when the demand increases.Phase 2 Poster . KernCOG. Retrieved April 26, 2010. A part of the study was a plan for regional rail throughout the county. The routes highlighted used existing rail infrastructure, except the Sunset route to Taft, whose tracks would have to be relayed. The primary communities connected would be Bakersfield, Taft, Lamont, Arvin, and Shafter. There would also be additional stations in East Bakersfield, Rosedale, and Gosford. Similar to the city, the county is also too small to support a system at this time. However, this system could be implemented in the future, as the population of the county continues to grow.

The building is a hypothetical method to combat geographic urban sprawl and lower the environmental impact of populations. Xtopia features a tripod base which combats winds and ground tremors, while allowing sunlight to pass through to surrounding buildings and parks. There are industrial sections in the legs, commercial floors in the first panoramic levels, residential levels, and aeroponic gardens further up.

The program stated that a traditional lift system wouldn't have worked in the building because it might take hours to reach the destination. A special lift system would be used, which not only would slide with the iron bars of the building in upward and downward direction, but also move sideways.

It is the twenty-third and the season finale episode of the show's sixth season and aired on May 16, 2010. Plot The show opens with Mary Alice narrating over the hostage scene at Eddie's house: while Eddie panics, all Lynette can think about is her children. Lynette offers to give evidence for Eddie, and tell the police what a horrible woman his mother was, but Eddie confesses that his mother was not the only person he has killed. He wants to drop Lynette off in the middle of nowhere so that by the time she is able to tell somebody what he has done, he will be long gone. Lynette tells him that she is unable to go along with this plan, as she has just gone into labor. She pleads with him to take her to a hospital as she is already having contractions, but Eddie refuses, too scared that she will tell somebody what he has done. Outside, Tom pulls up after spotting Lynette's car and knocks on the door. Eddie covers Lynette's mouth to keep her quiet and she is unable to answer, so Tom leaves, thinking she is giving him the silent treatment for getting drunk the night before. By this point it is too late to go to the hospital, Lynette tells Eddie the baby is on its way, and he is forced to deliver the baby. Eddie is faced with the difficult task of saving the baby's life when she is born with the umbilical cord around her neck. Eddie leaves soon after the birth, despite Lynette telling him he will never be free from his pain as long as he runs away. He soon comes back, and Lynette allows him to hold the baby while she calls the police. A former nurse from the maternity ward at Fairview hospital, named Teresa Pruitt, is admitted as a patient. In flashback scenes she is shown working during the births of Susan, Gabrielle and Lynette's children (although it is not known which children she cared for). Terresa admits to a visiting priest that she didn't retire from the hospital; she quit because of guilt. He offers to take her confession, but she tells him that she does not want what she is about to say to remain private, as it must be put right. The priest then proceeds to a hospital directors office. Teresa has died, but not before telling him her secret. The director calls in lawyers, one of whom states that he knows the family affected by the secret, they live on Wisteria Lane. He then worries how he will be able to tell the family that the child they have been raising isn't their own. Bree tells Orson and Andrew that she is being blackmailed by Sam, as he has found out about Andrew running over Carlos' mother 11 years ago. Bree reveals that she intends to hand over her company in order to silence him. Andrew wants to let Sam go to the police, and states that maybe it is time he owned up to what happened. Orson does not want Bree to give in, either. However, Bree asks him to leave, as it is between her and Andrew. Bree signs over her company to Sam, and he asks her not to hate him. Bree tells Sam that she doesn't hate him, she pities him and the lonely life he leads. Meanwhile, Orson resents Bree for sending him to prison because of running over Mike, yet giving up her company in order to save Andrew from the same fate. He admits he respected Bree for holding him to her high standards, yet now the respect is gone because she dropped her standards to protect Andrew. Bree insists she had no choice but to protect Andrew, and Orson tells her there is always a choice, and his choice is to no longer be her husband. Andrew finds Bree in Orson's empty room, and she asks for his permission to do something she should have done a long time ago. After saying goodbye to Susan, Bree tells Gabrielle that she has something to tell her that may destroy their friendship. Gabrielle arrives at the hospital to tell Nick about the note Angie had written, although the nurse on duty will not allow her to his room until the next morning. Gabrielle then waits for another nurse to come to the front desk, and impersonates Angie by mimicking her distinctive New York City accent to intimidate the nurse into taking her to Nick's room. Gabrielle tells Nick that Angie and Danny are being held hostage in the house, Nick refuses to call the police, so Gabrielle agrees to drive him back to Wisteria Lane. Meanwhile, Angie has completed the bomb for Patrick, and expects for her and Danny to now be set free. However Patrick reveals that she will have to go to Oregon with him while Danny remains hostage at the house, so that he can be sure the bomb works. If it doesn't, he will kill them both. Patrick gives Angie time to say goodbye to Danny whilst he goes to put the bomb in the car. However, when the door is closed, he hides the bomb in a cupboard. Gabrielle and Nick pull up on the street, and plan to distract Patrick whilst Nick slips into the house. However, Gabrielle is forced to act alone when Nick, still under the influence of his medication, passes out. Gabrielle takes Susan over to Angie's house, in order for Susan to distract Patrick, which doesn't work. Gabrielle sneaks in the back to free Danny as Angie and Patrick stop in the car just down the street. Patrick reveals that he came back to punish Angie, and presses the detonator of the bomb, telling Angie she has 30 seconds to save her son. Gabrielle struggles to free Danny, as Angie runs to the house, and stops outside. She turns to face the car, and with a smirk on her face reveals the bomb is actually in the detonator. The car explodes, and Patrick is killed inside. Gabrielle then helps Angie and Nick again by giving them enough money to leave Wisteria Lane. Angie and Nick leave for Atlanta, and they send Danny to New York so he can start a new life without his parents' past chasing him. Susan holds a garage sale before she moves from her house on Wisteria Lane to an \\"apartment behind a gas station\\". While she sits counting the money in her empty house, M.J. tells Mike and Susan that he didn't know there was a 'sell pile' for the garage sale. It turns out his favorite toy dinosaur has been sold to Roy, who in turn has given it to his deaf grandson. Susan having to tell M.J. that he can't have the dinosaur back because life isn't fair leads to her telling Mike that she resents him for messing up and causing them to move from the house where she raised her children. Mike tells her they will one day move back to the house on Wisteria Lane, and breaks off the piece of wood on which Susan had recorded her children's heights so she can take it with her to carry on marking M.J.'s height. As Susan and Mike leave Wisteria Lane, the new occupant of their house pulls into the driveway in a Lincoln Towncar, and is revealed to be none other than Martha Huber's killer, Paul Young.

Kennedy. Delta's first acquisition, in February 1998, was Miller-Motte Business College, with campuses in Clarksville, TN, Wilmington, NC, and Lynchburg, VA. Delta later purchased Career Training Specialists in Monroe, Louisiana. In September 2000, Miller-Motte Business Colleges and Career Training Specialists changed their names to Miller-Motte Technical College and Career Technical College, respectively. In December of that year, Miller-Motte launched a new branch campus in Charleston, South Carolina. Delta Career Education Corporation operates the brands Berks Technical Institute, McCann School of Business and Technology and Miller-Motte Technical College. 19 campuses were purchased by Ancora Education It operated 43 campuses across the United States in 2017. In September 2017, it was announced that Delta was closing seven campuses in North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Louisiana. Expansion In August 2002, Delta acquired the McCann School of Business and Technology, a school that was founded in 1897 and operates campuses in Carlisle, Allentown, Pottsville, Sunbury, Dickson City, and Hazleton, Pennsylvania. The Mahanoy City branch of McCann moved to Hazleton in May 2005. In September 2002, Delta purchased The Creative Circus, a school for advertising (copywriting and art direction), graphic design, photography, and interactive development, and opened a branch campus of Miller-Motte Technical College in Chattanooga, Tennessee. In November 2003 Delta acquired Miami- Jacobs Career College, a school that was founded in 1860 and operates in Dayton, Ohio. A second Miami-Jacobs location opened in Springboro, Ohio in July 2005, and a third location opened in Troy, Ohio in February 2007. Delta Education opened several additional branch locations in 2004 and 2005. Miller- Motte Technical College opened in Raleigh, North Carolina in October 2004, Career Technical College in Shreveport, Louisiana opened in November 2004, and Miller-Motte Technical College in Nashville, Tennessee opened in May 2005. The Nashville school is Delta Education's first school to offer courses in Heating and Air Conditioning, Welding, and Electrician. In May 2006, Delta was once again re-capitalized by Gryphon Investors, through Gryphon Colleges Corporation. Gryphon Investors is a $700 million San Francisco-based private equity fund that focuses on leveraged acquisitions of growth investments in middle market companies in partnership with experienced management teams that run them. Gryphon Colleges Corporation was formed at the end of 2004 by Gryphon Investors through the acquisition of National Career Education (NCE), a four campus school (Lamson College, National Career Education, Institute For Business and Technology, Tucson College) company located in Arizona and California. In June 2007 Lamson Institute opened in San Antonio, Texas. On August 3, 2006 Delta acquired The Academy of Court Reporting (ACR), a school that was founded in the 1970s and operates in the following cities in Ohio: Cleveland, Akron, Columbus, Cincinnati, as well as in Clawson, Michigan and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In March 2008, Delta Acquired its 10th school brand, Berks Technical Institute (BTI) in Wyomissing, PA. BTI, located in southeastern Pennsylvania, was founded in 1982 and is home to over 700 students. The 8th Miller-Motte campus was opened in Raleigh, NC in July 2008 followed by the Greenville, NC branch in March 2009, Fayetteville in November 2009 and Conway, SC in March 2010.

It has raised funds and advocated for children with cancer since 1980. In 2018, Wipe Out Kids' Cancer announced former Texas A&M; football player, Luke Laufenberg, as their 33rd annual Honorary Race Chair & Founding Member of the WOKC Youth Advisory Council. Mission and history Commemorating 30 years of progress in investing in pediatric cancer research, Wipe Out Kids' Cancer has raised over $3 million in the crusade against pediatric cancer. Since being founded in 1980, the survival rates for some cancers, such as Leukemia, have increased from less than 50% to nearly 90%. Several of the top cancer initiatives are programs that WOKC has supported over the years. For many childhood cancers, the odds of survival are still less than 50%. Cancer remains the number one disease killer of American children and the number two killer after auto accidents. Every day 46 children will be diagnosed with cancer. Of those, 7 will not survive, and of those who do survive nearly 66% will struggle with chronic medical issues brought on by the treatment of their cancer. Wipe Out Kids Cancer strives to represent kids with cancer and be an advocate for them. Events hosted WOKC raises funds primarily through special events throughout the year. Our largest annual fundraising event is the American Airlines Kids Cancer Golf Classic. Held in the fall each year, golfers are treated to exceptional \\"goody\\" bags with BlackBerry phones and Bachendorf watches. In 2004, WOKC made national news as one of the golfers hit a hole-in- one to win a Maserati Spyder from Park Place Maserati. Over the past 5 years, the event has raised over $725,000 for Wipe Out Kids' Cancer. WOKC's mainstay event is the Tom Thumb Run for the Children Fun Run and Addison Oktoberfest 5K, which is held in conjunction with the Town of Addison's Oktoberfest celebration in September. Runners enjoy cash prizes from Amica Insurance, families enjoy a post-race party featuring Eddie Coker, and everyone receives free entry to Addison's Oktoberfest with registration. In 2005, the Spirit of \\"Little Mo\\" Awards were introduced at a 25th Anniversary gala. The awards were created to honor community leaders who have committed to eradicating pediatric cancer. In 2008, the gala moved to spring, and appropriately changed its name to \\"Swing into Spring.\\" The gala featured swing band dancing, the Spirit of \\"Little Mo\\" Awards, and an incredible auction. Ann Podeszwa chaired the 2008 event which netted over $125,000 for Wipe Out Kids' Cancer.

In modern psychology, vigilance, also termed sustained concentration, is defined as the ability to maintain concentrated attention over prolonged periods of time.Warm, J., Parasuraman, R., & Matthews, G. (2008). During this time, the person attempts to detect the appearance of a particular target stimulus. The individual watches for a signal stimulus that may occur at an unknown time.Vigilance Requires Hard Mental Work and Is Stressful. Human Factors, 50. 433-441. The study of vigilance has expanded since the 1940s mainly due to the increased interaction of people with machines for applications involving monitoring and detection of rare events and weak signals. Such applications include air traffic control, inspection and quality control, automated navigation, military and border surveillance, and lifeguarding. Origins of research The systematic study of vigilance was initiated by Norman Mackworth during World War II. Mackworth authored \\"The breakdown of vigilance during prolonged visual search\\" in 1948 and this paper is the seminal publication on vigilance.Mackworth, N.H. (1948). The breakdown of vigilance during prolonged visual search, Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 1, 6-21. Mackworth's 1948 study investigated the tendency of radar and sonar operators to miss rare irregular event detections near the end of their watch. Mackworth simulated rare irregular events on a radar display by having the test participants watch an unmarked clock face over a 2-hour period. A single clock hand moved in small equal increments around the clock face, with the exception of occasional larger jumps. This device became known as the Mackworth Clock. Participants were tasked to report when they detected the larger jumps. Mackworth's results indicated a decline in signal detection over time, known as a vigilance decrement. The participants' event detection declined between 10 and 15 percent in the first 30 minutes and then continued to decline more gradually for the remaining 90 minutes. Mackworth's method became known as the \\"Clock Test\\" and this method has been employed in subsequent investigations. Vigilance decrement Vigilance decrement is defined as \\"deterioration in the ability to remain vigilant for critical signals with time, as indicated by a decline in the rate of the correct detection of signals\\".Parasuraman, R. (1986). Vigilance, Monitoring and Search In J.R. Boff, L. Kaufmann & J.P. Thomas (Eds.) Handbook of Human Perception and Performance, Vol.2, Cognitive Processes and Performance (pp 41‚Äì1 - 41-49). New York, Wiley. Vigilance decrement is most commonly associated with monitoring to detect a weak target signal. Detection performance loss is less likely to occur in cases where the target signal exhibits a high saliency. For example, a radar operator would be unlikely to miss a rare target at the end of a watch if it were a large bright flashing signal, but might miss a small dim signal. Under most conditions, vigilance decrement becomes significant within the first 15 minutes of attention,Teichner, W.H. (1974). The detection of a simple visual signal as a function of time on watch. Human Factors 16, 339-353. but a decline in detection performance can occur more quickly if the task demand conditions are high.Helton et al. (2007). The abbreviated vigilance task and cerebral hemodynamics. Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology, 29, 549-552. This occurs in both experienced and novice task performers.Mackie, R.R. (1984). Research relevance and the information glut. Human Factors Review, (pp 1‚Äì11), Santa Monica, CA: Human Factors Society. Vigilance had traditionally been associated with low cognitive demand and vigilance decrement with a decline in arousal pursuant to the low cognitive demand,Frankmann, J.P. & Adams, J.A. (1962). Theories of Vigilance. Psychological Bulletin, 59, 257-272. but later studies indicated that vigilance is hard work, requiring the allocation of significant cognitive resources, and inducing significant levels of stress.Parasuraman, R. & Davies, D.R. (1977). A taxonomic analysis of vigilance. In R.R. Mackie, (ed.) Vigilance: Theory, operational performance and physiological correlates, (pp 559‚Äì574) New York: Plenum. Vigilance decrement and Signal Detection Theory Green and SwetsGreen, D.M. & Swets, J.A. (1966) Signal Detection Theory and Psychophysics. New York: Wiley formulated the Signal Detection Theory, or SDT, in 1966 to characterize detection task performance sensitivity while accounting for both the observer's perceptual ability and willingness to respond. SDT assumes an active observer making perceptual judgments as conditions of uncertainty vary. A decision maker can vary their response bias, characterized by d', to allow more or less correct detections, but at the respective cost of more or less false alarms. This is termed a criterion shift. The degree to which the observer tolerates false alarms to achieve a higher rate of detection is termed the bias. Bias represents a strategy to minimize the consequences of missed targets and false alarms. As an example, the lookout during a bank robbery must set a threshold for how \\"cop-like\\" an approaching individual or vehicle may be. Failing to detect the \\"cop\\" in a timely fashion may result in jail time, but a false alarm will result in a lost opportunity to steal money. In order to produce a bias-free measure, d' is calculated by measuring the distance between the means of the signal and non-signals (noise) and scaling by the standard deviation of the noise. Mathematically, this can be accomplished by subtracting the z-score of the hit rate from the z-score of the false alarm rate. Application of SDT to the study of vigilance indicates that in most, but not all cases, vigilance decrement is not the result of a reduction in sensitivity over time.Broadbent, D.E. (1971) Decision and Stress. New York: Academic Press. In most cases a reduction of detections is accompanied by a commensurate reduction in false alarms, such that d' is relatively unchanged. Vigilance Taxonomy: discrimination type and event rate Mental workload, or cognitive load, based on task differences can significantly affect the degree of vigilance decrement. In 1977, Parasuraman and Davies investigated the effect of two task difference variables on d', and proposed the existence of a vigilance taxonomy based on discrimination type and event rate. Parasuraman and Davies employed discrimination tasks which were either successive or simultaneous, and presented both at high and low event rates. Successive discrimination tasks where critical information must be retained in working memory generate a greater mental workload than simultaneous comparison tasks. Their results indicate the type of discrimination and the rate at which discriminable events occur interact to affect sustained attention. Successive discrimination tasks indicate a greater degree of vigilance decrement than simultaneous discriminations, such as comparisons, but only when event rates are relatively high. For detection tasks, empirical evidence suggests that an event rate at or above 24 events per minute significantly reduces sensitivity. Further investigation has indicated that when the discrimination task is difficult, a decrement can occur when the mental workload is low, as with simultaneous comparisons, at both high and low event rates.Neuchterliein, K.H., Parasuraman, R. & Jiang, Q. (1983). Visual sustained attention: Image degradation produces rapid sensitivity decrement over time. Science, 220. 327-329.Williams, P.S. (1986). Processing demands, training and the vigilance decrement. Human Factors, 28. 567-579. The effect of event rate on monitoring task performance can be affected by the addition of non-target salient objects at varying frequencies. Clock test research conducted in the late 1950s and 1960s indicates that an increase in event rate for rare irregular low salience signals reduced the vigilance decrement. When non-target \\"artificial\\" signals similar to target signals were introduced, the vigilance decrement was also reduced. When the \\"artificial\\" signal differed significantly from the target signal, no performance improvement was measured.Mackworth, Jane F. (1963) The Effect of Intermittent Signal Probability on Vigilance. Canadian Journal of Psychology, 17(1). 82-89 Other dimensions beyond event rate and discrimination task difficulty affect the performance of vigilance tasks and are factors in the Vigilance Taxonomy. These include but are not limited to: sensory modality, or combinations of sensory modalities; source complexity; signal duration; signal intensity; multiple signal sources; discrete versus continuous events; intermittent versus continuous attention requirement; observer skill level; and stimulation value.Parasuraman, R. & Davies, D. (1977) A taxonomic analysis of vigilance performance. In R. Mackie (ed.) Vigilance: Theory, operational performance and physiological correlates. Plenum Press. Measuring mental workload during vigilance tasks Initial Vigilance Taxonomy studies relied on assumptions regarding the mental workload associated with discrimination tasks, rather than a direct quantification of that workload. Successive discriminations, for example, were assumed to impose a greater workload than simultaneous discriminations. Beginning in the late 1990s, neuroimaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and Transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) have been employed to independently assess brain activation and mental workload during vigilance experiments. These neuroimaging techniques estimate brain activation by measuring the blood flow (fMRI and TCD) or glucose metabolism (PET) associated with specific brain regions. Research employing these techniques has linked increases in mental workload and allocation of attentional resources with increased activity in the prefrontal cortex. Studies employing PET, fMRI and TCD indicate a decline in activity in the prefrontal cortex correlates with vigilance decrement. Neuroimaging studies also indicate that the control of vigilance may reside in the right cerebral hemisphere in a variety of brain regions.Parasuraman, R. & Caggiano, G. (2005). Neural and genetic assays of mental workload. In D. McBride and D. Schmorrow (Ed.) Quantifying Human Information Processing (pp 123‚Äì155). Lanham, Maryland: Rowman and Littlefield.  Associated brain regions  Reductions in arousal generally correspond to reductions in vigilance. Arousal is defined as a component of vigilance, though it is not, as one may believe, the sole source of the main effect of the vigilance decrement.Moruzzi, G. and Magoun, H.W. (1949) Brain stem reticular formation and activation of the EEG. EEG Clinical Neurophysiology I: 455-473 As such, subcortical brain regions associated with arousal play a critical role in the performance of vigilance tasks. Because the amygdala plays an important role in the recognition of emotional stimuli, it appears to be an important brain structure in the regulation of vigilance. Subcortical brain regions associated with arousal include the basal forebrain cholinergic system, and the locus coeruleus (LC) noradrenergic system.Parasuraman, R., Warm, J. & See, J. (1998) Brain Systems of Vigilance in The Attentive Brain R. Parasuraman (Ed.) pp. 221‚Äì256. Cambridge MA: MIT Press Both regions are components of the reticular activating system (RAS). The basal forebrain cholinergic system is associated with cortical acetylcholine release, which is associated with cortical arousal. Blocking the release of acetylcholine in the forebrain with GABAergic compounds impairs vigilance performance.Moore, H., Sarter, M. & Bruno, J.P. (1993) Bidirectional modulation of stimulated cortical acetylcholine release by benzodiazepine receptor ligands. Brain Res. 596: 17-29 Several cortical brain regions are associated with attention and vigilance. These include the right frontal, inferior parietal, prefrontal, superior temporal cortices and cingulate gyrus. In the frontal lobe, fMRI and TCD data indicate that brain activation increases during vigilance tasks with greater activation in the right hemisphere. Lesion and split brain studies indicate better right-brain performance on vigilance tasks, indicating an important role for the right frontal cortex in vigilance tasks.Shaw, T.H., Warm, J.S., Finomore, V., Tripp, L., Matthews, G., Weiler, E. & Parasuraman, R. (2009) Effects of sensory modality on cerebral blood flow velocity during vigilance, Neuroscience Letters 461, 207-211 Activity in the LC noradrenergic system is associated with the alert waking state in animals through the release of noradrenaline. Chemically blocking the release of noradrenaline induces drowsiness and lapses in attention associated with a vigilance decrement. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex exhibits a higher level of activation than other significantly active areas, indicating a key role in vigilance. The cingulate gyrus differs from other brain regions associated with vigilance in that it exhibits less activation during vigilance tasks. The role of the cingulate gyrus in vigilance is unclear, but its proximity and connections to the corpus callosum, which regulates interhemispheric activity, may be significant. Reduced activation in the cingulate gyrus may be a by-product of asymmetrical frontal lobe activation initiated in the corpus callosum.Steriade, M. (1996) Awakening the brain. Nature 383: 24 - 25 Stress Stressful activities involve continuous application of extensive cognitive resources. If the vigilance decrement were the result of less brain activity rather than more, vigilance tasks could not be expected to be stressful. High levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine are correlated with continuous extensive mental workloads, making these compounds good chemical indicators of stress levels. Subjects performing vigilance tasks exhibit elevated levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine, consistent with high stress levels and indicative of a significant mental workload.Lundberg, U. & Frankenhaeuser, M. (1979) Pituitary-adrenal and sympathetic adrenal correlates of distress and effort (Report 548). Stockholm, Sweden: University of Stockholm, Department of Psychology Vigilance tasks may therefore be assumed to be stressful, hard mental work. Individual differences in performance Large individual differences in monitoring task performance have been reported in a number of vigilance studies. For a given task, however, the vigilance decrement between subjects is generally consistent over time, such that individuals exhibiting relatively higher levels of performance for a given task maintain that level of performance over time.Davies, D.R. & Tune, G.S. (1969) Human Vigilance Performance. New York: American Elsevier For different tasks, however, individual performance differences are not consistentBaker, C.H. (1963) Consistency of performance in two human vigilance tasks. Vigilance: A Symposium. New York: McGraw-Hill Performance for any one individual may not correlate well from one task to another. An individual exhibiting no significant decrement while performing a counting monitoring task may exhibit a significant decrement during a clock test. Relative performance between subjects may also vary based on the nature of the task.Parasuraman, R. (1976) Consistency of Individual Differences of Human Vigilance Performance: An Abilities Classification Analysis. Journal of Applied Psychology Vol. 61 No. 4 486-492 For example, subjects whose task performance is well correlated for a successive task may exhibit a poor performance correlation for a simultaneous task. Conversely, subjects performing similar monitoring tasks, such as radar versus sonar target detection, can be expected to exhibit similar patterns of task performance. Levine et al. propose that individual differences in task performance may be influenced by task demands. For example, some tasks may require rapid comparisons or \\"perceptual speed\\", while others may require \\"flexibility of closure\\", such as detection of some predefined object within a cluttered scene.Levine, J.M., Romashko, T., & Fleishman, E.A. (1973) Evaluation of an abilities classification system for integrating and generalizing human performance research findings: An application to vigilance tasks. Journal of Applied Psychology 58, 149-157. Linking task performance differences to task demands is consistent with the Vigilance Taxonomy proposed by Parasuraman and Davies described above, and also supports the hypothesis that vigilance requires mental work, rather than being a passive activity. Reducing the vigilance decrement with amphetamines Considerable research has been devoted to the reduction of the vigilance decrement. As noted above, the addition of non-target signals can improve task performance over time if the signals are similar to the target signals. Additionally, practice, performance feedback, amphetamines and rest are believed to moderate temporal performance decline without reducing sensitivity.Mackworth, Jane F. (1964) Performance Decrement in Vigilance, Threshold, and High-Speed Perceptual Motor Tasks. Canadian Journal of Psychology, 18(3). 209-223 Beginning in the mid-1940s research was conducted to determine whether amphetamines could reduce or counteract the vigilance decrement.Solandt, D.Y. & Partridge, D.M. (1946) Research on auditory problems presented by naval operations. Journal of the Canadian Medical Service3. 323-329Mackworth, N.H. (1950) Researches on the measurement of human performance. Med .Res .Council, Special Report., No. 268 In 1965, Jane Mackworth conducted clock test experiments in which half of 56 participants were given a strong amphetamine and half were given a placebo.Mackworth, J.F. (1965) The effect of amphetamine on the detectability of signals in a vigilance task. Canadian Journal of Psychology 19 (2). 104-117 Mackworth also provided false feedback and feedback in separate trials. Mackworth analyzed detection and false alarm rates to determine d', the measure of sensitivity. Participants dosed with amphetamine exhibited no increased sensitivity but did exhibit a highly significant reduction in vigilance decrement. In feedback trials, sensitivity increased while the performance decline was significantly reduced. In trials where both amphetamine and feedback were given, sensitivity was increased and there was no significant vigilance decrement. Practice and sustained attention Training and practice significantly reduce the vigilance decrement, reduce the false alarm rate, and may improve sensitivity for many sustained attention tasks. Changes in strategy or bias may improve task performance. Improvements based on such a criterion shift would be expected to occur early in the training process.Wiliges, R.C. (1976) The vigilance increment: An ideal observer hypothesis. In T.B. Sheridan and G. Johannsen (Eds.) Monitoring Behavior and Supervisory Control. New York: Plenum Experiments involving both audio and visual stimuli indicate the expected training performance improvement within the first five to ten hours of practice or less.Mackworth, J.F. (1963) Effect of Reference Marks on the Detection of Signals on a Clock Face. Journal of Applied Psychology, 47(3). 196-201.Kerkhoff, G.A., van der Schaaf, T.W. & Korving, H.J. (1980) Auditory Signal Detection: Effects of long-term practice and time on task. Perception and Psychophysics 28, 79-81Moray N., Fitter, M. Ostry, D., Favreau D., & Nagy, V. (1976) Attention to pure tones. Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology 28, 271-283 Training improvements may also occur due to the reduced mental workload associated with task automaticity. In pilotage and airport security screening experiments, trained or expert subjects exhibit better detection of low salience targets, a reduction in false alarms, improved sensitivity, and a significantly reduced vigilance decrement. In some cases the vigilance decrement was eliminated or not apparent.Uenking, M. (2000) Pilot Biofeedback Training in the Cognitive Awareness Training Study. American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronomics, Proceedings 2000-4074, 1-8McCarley, J.S., Kramer, A.F., Wickens, C.D., Vidoni, E.D., & Boot W.R. (2004) Visual Skills in Airport Security Screening. Psychological Science 15, 302-306Fisk, A.D. & Schneider, W. (1981) Control and automatic processing during tasks requiring sustained attention: A new approach to vigilance. Human Factors 23, 737-750. Aging Vigilance research conducted with subjects across a range of ages conflict regarding the ability to maintain alertness and sustained attention with age. In 1991, Parasuraman and Giambra reported a trend towards lower detection rates and higher false alarm rates with age when comparing groups between 19 and 27, 40 and 55, and 70 and 80 years old.Parasuraman, R. & Giambra, L. (1991) Skill Development in Vigilance: Effects of Event Rate and Age. Psychology and Aging, 6(2), 155-169. Deaton and Parasuraman reported in 1993 that beyond the age of 40 years, a trend towards lower detection rates and higher false alarm rates occurs in both cognitive tasks and sensory tasks, with higher and lower mental workloads respectively.Deaton, J. & Parasuraman, R. (1993) Sensory and Cognitive Vigilance: Effect of Age on Performance and Subjective Workload. Human Performance, 6(1), 71-97. Berardi, Parasuraman and Haxby reported no differences in 2001 in the overall levels of vigilance and the ability to sustain attention over time for when comparing middle aged (over 40) and younger subjects.Berardi, A., Parasuraman, R. & Haxby, J. (2001) Overall vigilance and Sustained Attention Decrements in Healthy Aging. Experimental Aging Research 27, 19-39. Age dependent differences in cognitive tasks may differ with task type and workload, and some differences in detection and false alarms may be due to the reduction in the sensitivity of sensory organs. Lack of habituation Early theories of vigilance explained the reduction of electrophysiological activity over time associated with the vigilance decrement as a result of neural habituation.Mackworth, J.F. (1969) Vigilance and Habituation. Baltimore MD: Penguin Habituation is the decrease in neural responsivity due to repeated stimulation. Under passive conditions, when no task is performed, participants exhibit attenuated N100 Event Related Potentials (ERP) that indicate neural habituation, and it was assumed that habituation was also responsible for the vigilance decrement. More recent ERP studies indicate that when performance declines during a vigilance task, N100 amplitude was not diminished. These results indicate that vigilance decrement is not the result of boredom or a reduction in neurological sensitivity.Parasuraman, R. (1985) Sustained attention: a multifactorial approach.

Founded in 1973, the choir has often been invited to perform/ record songs for various important events such as television/radio shows, films, concerts, advertisements (especially at Christmas and Chinese New Year), etc.  Introduction  Wong Tai Sin Children's Choir, the first district children's choir in Hong Kong, was founded in 1973. Its establishment went back to July in 1972. The former Leisure and Cultural Services Department held a Community Children's Singing Competition. The excellent result reflected that there were numerous musically talented children living in Wong Tai Sin. Wong Tai Sin Children's Choir was established with the help of the Government and non-government organization to become an independent registered charitable organization. Its establishment aims at developing member's musical potential and community consciousness through well-steered musical activities. Formerly members were confined to children of Wong Tai Sin District. To cope with the demand, the choir has extended its membership by considering applications from children of other districts as well. In early 1978, youth group was first established. Wong Tai Sin Youth Choir was established in 1982 because of the expansion of the youth group. Since April 1979, a scholarship / bursary fund has been established for members who have interest and potential to furthering their vocal and instrumental training but are financially unable to pay for the training fees. With its association of the Social and Welfare Department, a suite on the 1st floor of Wong Tai Sin Community Centre is allocated to the Choir in 1980.  Aims  # To develop the musical and other artistic potentials of children with formal training. # To encourage and guide children to pursue music-making as a lifelong passion. # To help children develop an all-rounded personality. # To promote community consciousness.  Organization  In addition to the Director of Music and the Choirmaster, the executive committees comprise representation from welfare and charitable organizations, schools in the district, as well as religious associations.  Financial support  The following financial support maintains the choir: # Charity trust from society # Funding from District Council # Choir members' training fees # Donations from various organizations for the children's participation in concerts by invitations  Choir members  The choir consists of four groups: Infant, Small Children, Junior Children, and Teenage. The children attend regular training sessions each Saturday at the Wong Tai Sin Community under qualified choir conductors and piano accompanists. In addition to vocal training, members are also provided with opportunities to receive private instrumental coaching, such as piano, violin, etc.  Performances  :TV shows : Musicals :Movies :Concerts :Advertisements  References   External links  * WTSCC's website Category:Musical groups established in 1973 Category:Hong Kong choirs Category:Choirs of children Category:Wong Tai Sin District ","title":"Wong Tai Sin Children's Choir"},{"id":"27120855","text":"K.

Its chemical structure resembles that of pyridoxine (a type of vitamin B6). It is not approved for any medical use in the United States or Europe. History Emoxypine was first synthesized by L.D. Smirnov and K.M. Dumayev, then studied and developed in the Institute of Pharmacology, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences and National Scientific Center of Bioactive Substances Safety. Use In Russia, emoxypine has a wide range of applications in medical practice. It purportedly exercises anxiolytic, anti-stress, anti-alcohol, anticonvulsant, nootropic, neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory action. Emoxypine presumably improves cerebral blood circulation, inhibits thrombocyte aggregation, lowers cholesterol levels, has cardioprotective and antiatherosclerotic action. Mechanism of action Emoxypine's mechanism of action is believed to be its antioxidant and membrane-protective effects with the following key components: * Emoxypine inhibits free radical oxidation of biomembrane lipids, reacts to peroxide radicals of lipids primary and hydroxyl radical of peptides * Increases the activity of antioxidant enzymes, specifically that of superoxide dismutase, responsible for the formation and consumption of lipid peroxides and active oxygen forms * Inhibits free radicals during the synthesis of prostaglandin catalyzed cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase, increases the correlation prostacyclin/ thromboxane A2 and blocks the leukotriene formation * Increases the content of polar fraction of lipids (phosphatidyl serine and phosphatidyl inositol) and reduces the cholesterol/phospholipids ratio which proves its lipid-regulatory properties; shifts structure transition into the low temperature zones, that is provokes the reduction of membrane viscosity and the increase of its fluidity, increases lipid-protein ratio. * Modulates the activity of membrane-bound enzymes: phosphodiesterase, cyclic nucleotides, adenylate cyclase, aldoreductase, acetylcholinesterase. * Modulates the receptor complexes of the brain membranes, i.e. benzodiazepine, GABA, acetylcholine receptors by increasing their binding ability. * Stabilizes biomembranes, i.e. membrane structures of blood cells - erythrocytes and thrombocytes during their haemolysis or mechanical injury accompanied by the formation of free radicals. * Changes the monoamine level and increases the dopamine content in the brain. Clinical study One study determined the effectiveness of emoxypine in 205 patients with clinical manifestations of lumbosacral radiculopathy (LSR). Patients were divided into two groups, and further were divided into subgroups depending on the presence of motor disturbances. All patients received a course of conventional medical treatment and physiotherapy; main group additionally received emoxypine. Thereafter, clinical-neurological control of long-term results of treatment in subgroups of patients was performed. The results showed that the use of emoxypine in the combined therapy of patients with LSR led to significant and persistent reduction of severity of pain syndrome and rapid recovery of function of spinal roots and peripheral nerves compared with conventional therapy.

With more than 5,000 members, IEDC is the largest national and global organization of its kind.. IEDC is located in Washington, D.C., and is governed by a Board of Directors and by the President and CEO, currently Jeffrey A. Finkle, CEcD. As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, IEDC is legally barred from endorsing political candidates and may only engage in limited lobbying activities.http://www.iedconline.org/?p=FAQs IEDC's strategic directives include the core topics of globalization, sustainability, entrepreneurship, and economic restructuring. IEDC works with communities and economic development organizations to weave these core topics into pertinent economic development projects, such as community revitalization, business development, and job creation nationwide and abroad.  Background  The IEDC was created as a result of a merger between the Council of Urban Economic Development (CUED) and the American Economic Development Council (AEDC) in May 2001.http://www.fedc.net/wp- content/uploads/2011/09/IEDC_EDJournal_Summer_11.pdf Both AEDC and CUED were organizations that were formed as a result of efforts by businessmen and civic leaders. Founders came from the railroad utilities, and the public and private sectors. Despite their diverse backgrounds and professional experiences, founders of each organization shared a common passion to develop their cities and communities into vibrant places to live and do business. The AEDC had been operating in various forms since 1926 with focus on industrial development. AEDC had been linked to the Economic Development Institute (EDI) since the early 1960s, with the focus on training and development for economic development as a profession. Notably, AEDC‚Äôs education initiatives developed professionalism in the field, fostered the sharing of best practices among economic developers and cultivated an expertise among those in the profession. AEDC members offered their services around the world in order to encourage the use of common economic development tools internationally. AEDC traditionally had a high representation of members from the American South, and a large contingent of Canadian members that concentrated on forging ties with the private sector. The CUED originated as \\"Helping Urban Business\\", or the HUB Council, in 1966. It changed its name to CUED in 1974. The founding of the CUED followed the civil disturbances/urban riots in Watts in Los Angeles and other cities like Detroit, Newark and Washington. These disturbances further weakened the position of many urban economies, as manufacturing and commercial businesses increased their exodus to the suburbs and outer transportation corridors. The CUED‚Äôs primary objective was to develop an urban policy for economic development. In 1968, the Economic Development Administration (EDA) provided the CUED with a grant for technical assistance, information, and research. From its early days, CUED established itself as a go-to organization for research and technical assistance on federal programs like the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program and the UDAG Program and played an important role in helping to develop strong economic development policies.  Members  As the world's largest membership organization serving the economic development profession, IEDC members represent the entire range of economic development experience. Members come from the public and private sectors and rural and urban areas throughout the globe. IEDC members promote economic development through the auspices of local, state, provincial and federal governments, public-private partnerships, chambers of commerce, universities and a variety of other institutions. Members include: :* Regional, state, county, and city economic development organizations :* Chambers of commerce and other business support agencies :* Community and neighborhood development organizations :* Technology development agencies :* Utility companies :* Educational institutions :* Consultants :* Redevelopment authorities  Programs and services  IEDC additionally provides professional development services, offering 25 courses each year in over 30 states, educating its network of 1,200 Certified Economic Developers (CEcDs) and other practitioners, and certifying Economic Development Organizations (EDOs) through its accreditation program (AEDO).

The department also publishes relevant policy papers and issues a Federal Leadership Economic Development Award that recognizes an individual whose commitment to economic development enhances the industry as a whole. = Advisory services and research = IEDC has two research arms: The Advisory Services and Research Department (ASR) works directly with local communities and Federal agencies to provide peer-review technical assistance and practice-oriented research on a variety of economic development topic areas. The department focuses on important matters that impact communities and the profession, enabling practitioners to better compete in today‚Äôs global economy. ASR services focus on: * Strategic Planning * Organizational Development & Program Analysis * Real Estate Development & Reuse * Business Retention, Expansion & Attraction * Neighborhood Development & Revitalization * Research Publications & Policy Analysis * Technology-led Economic Development The Economic Development Research Partnerships Program (EDRP) is a think-tank that operates under the IEDC banner, which directs research that will benefit the economic development profession as whole. EDRP research is not being done anywhere else and EDRP members choose what areas of research to fund and how those topics will be addressed. Some issues examined have included: * Seeking new ways to capitalize on foreign markets * Integrating regional businesses into the global economy * New realities for economic development organizations * Capitalizing on new technologies, networks and software * Strategies to support growth-oriented companies * Responding to population and demographic changes * Preparing for risk and unforeseen challenges = Other services = IEDC offers several webinars each year on pertinent economic development topics; publishes a bi-monthly online newsletter, Economic Development Now; provides members with quarterly copies of the Economic Development Journal; maintains the Clearinghouse Information Research; and provides members with full benefits of the GrantStation Premium Access Program (GPA).

Geographic situation makes Jiangxi distinguish from its neighbors, as high mountains separate it from Zhejiang to the east, Fujian and Guangdong to the south, Hunan to the west and Yangzi River forms a natural division between the South and northern China. Language Gan Chinese has always played a significant role in Jiangxi culture. The Chinese variety is spoken mainly in Jiangxi but also in surrounding regions such as Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and Fujian. Modern Gan is considered as one of Sinitic languages, which derives from Old Gan and still keeps some linguistic traces of ancient languages in South China. Gan Chinese is written in traditional Chinese characters with Gan variants. Many vocabulary items are no longer used in most Chinese varieties, particularly in Mandarin, while they remain in daily usage in Gan. For example, cooking utensils are called uoh () or tiang () in Gan which date back to the Shang Dynasty. The Bible was also translated into some Gan dialects as the Christianity was introduced into Jiangxi as early as the 16th century, with the arrival of Marco Polo. Academy culture Since the academy represents the historical and cultural progress in a place, the importance of it gradually increased during the thousands of years in China.

In January 1746/7, he inherited the estate of East Knoyle from his uncle, William. In 1753, Seymour married Lady Caroline Cowper (d. 1773), daughter of William Clavering-Cowper, 2nd Earl Cowper, by whom he had two daughters: * Caroline Seymour (31 January 1755 ‚Äì 20 March 1821), married in September 1775 William Danby, of Swinton Park (b. 9 July 1752) * Georgiana Amelia Seymour (31 Dec 1756 ‚Äì ?), married on 27 September 1794 F√©licit√© Jean Louis de Durfort, Comte de Deyme (4 March 1752 ‚Äì 10 March 1801) He inherited an estate at Sherborne, Dorset upon the death of his father in December 1761, and also owned estates at Redland Court, Gloucestershire, and Northbrook, Devonshire. After his father's death, he entered politics, obtaining the office of Groom of the Bedchamber on 16 February 1763 and being returned as Member of Parliament for Totnes in a by-election that year. On 17 January 1765, he resigned his office as Groom of the Bedchamber. In 1768, he was returned for Huntingdon. After buying an estate at Norton, Worcestershire, he was returned as a Whig for Evesham in 1774, but did not stand in 1780. He is only known to have addressed the House once, in 1776, supporting Fox's motion to inquire into the mismanagement of the American war. On 5 October 1775, after the death of his first wife in 1773, he married the widow Anne Louise Th√©r√®se, Comtesse de Panthou. Louise (1741‚Äì1821) was the daughter of Charles de la Martelli√®re (b1700) and Claudine Louise de Lory (1706‚Äì1742). By this marriage he had one son: *Henry Seymour (1776‚Äì1849) Seymour and his wife moved to Paris in 1778, and he soon after bought an estate at Prunay. Around 1779 or 1780, Seymour became the lover of Madame du Barry. He separated from his second wife in early 1781. The French Revolution led him to flee France in August 1792, and he lost most of his property in that country through confiscation. He spent the rest of his life in retirement at Knoyle. Seymour is often stated to have died in 1805, but his monument in Exeter Cathedral dates from 1807. By this time, he had disposed of his estates at Sherborne, Redland, and Norton, leaving Knoyle and Northbrook to his son Henry.

Their relationship began while they were studying at the University of Pennsylvania School of Architecture. Upon graduation, they both received a traveling fellowship that eventually led them to San Francisco in 1937.Cleper-Borkovi, Felicia et al. (2007). Modernity in Healing and Learning: The Architecture of Anshen + Allen. Keck Science Center at Pepperdine University, designed by Anshen and Allen Their first project was the Davies House, a Tudor Gothic inspired mansion in Woodside, California, commissioned by Ralph K. Davies, a senior vice-president of Standard Oil of California. The house was completed on November 30, 1941. After the end of World War II, as a generalist practice, the firm developed gas station prototypes for Standard Oil, parking garages and interior naval architecture. Joseph Eichler and John Calder Mackay, both residential real estate developers, commissioned Anshen and Allen to build the initial Eichler homes and Mackay Homes in the California Modernist style beginning in the 1950s.Arbunich, Marty. (2002). Eichler: Modernism Rebuilds the American Dream.Ditto, Jerry et al. (1995). Eichler Homes: Design for Living. The firm continued to build tract housing until 1962. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, under the leadership of Derek Parker, the firm was transformed into a modern international architectural practice. During the mid-2000s, Anshen and Allen adopted the use of Building Information Modeling (BIM).Barista, Dave. Building Design & Construction.

Biography Seymour was the second son of Sir Edward Seymour, and Dorothy, daughter of Sir Henry Killigrew of Lothbury, Cornwall. He was a Page of Honour to Queen Henrietta Maria and made Groom of the Bedchamber to Charles, Prince of Wales in 1638. Upon the outbreak of the English Civil War Seymour joined the Royalist army, serving under his kinsman William, Marquess of Hertford. He accompanied the Marquess into Somerset and was at Battle of Sherburn when with only two troops of horse (cavalry) and 400-foot, the Royalists withstood the whole force of the William, Earl of Bedford, consisting of above 7,000-foot supported by horse and artillery. During this engagement Hertford sent Bedford a challenge which was carried by Seymour. Attaching himself to Prince Charles, he carried the message from him to the Earl of Warwick in August 1648 concerning the surrender of the fleet. cites Clarendon, Rebellion, xi. 69. When the Royalist cause was lost, Seymour accompanied Charles, Prince of Wales into exile and was commissioned to carry the last messages between the Prince and his father King Charles I, which he delivered on 27 January 1649 (just three days before the Kings execution, and the day the verdict was delivered). It is said on hearing the verdict he broke down, and kissed the king, clasped his legs, and moaning aloud. To him the king imparted his last letter to the prince. He was sent by Charles II from Jersey to Ireland in September 1649. cites Gardiner, Commonwealth, i. 160, 207. He accompanied Charles to Scotland in 1650, was voted away from the king's person by the Scottish committee, and left at Aberdeen after the defeat at Dunbar. cites Cal. Clarendon Papers, ii. 69, 77, 87. In 1651 he is described as of Charles's bedchamber at Paris, cites Clarendon, ubi supra, xiii. 108. and was frequently despatched by the king to his friends in England. cites Cal. Clarendon Papers, ii. 297. In January 1654 he collected ¬£1,920 for Charles in England, and received a pass on his return to France from the Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell. He represented that he was solely engaged in his private affairs. He almost immediately returned to England, and would appear to have been arrested in June 1654. He was not released until the end of May 1657, and then upon hard terms. cites Cal. Clarendon Papers, iii. 303. At the Restoration in 1660 he continued in his office (until 1685) as Groom of the Bedchamber to Charles, now King Charles II, and was appointed Comptroller of Customs and Clerk of the Hanaper. In 1660 he was also elected the MP for East Looe to the Convention Parliament and then to the Cavalier Parliament until 1681. In 1666, Seymour leased the estate of Langley, Buckinghamshire, which he purchased in 1669, receiving with it the manor of Langley. He retired to Langley and died on 9 March 1686 aged 74, leaving his estate to his son Sir Henry Seymour. During his retirement Seymour was known to be honourable, affable, generous and charitable. He endowed, In his lifetime, an alms house, at Langley for six poor elderly people; and by his last will and testament, gave ¬£400 to put out poor boys apprentices, beside other charitable legacies to specific persons. Family Seymour married twice. His first marriage was to Elizabeth (died 1671), daughter of Sir Join Killigrew, and widow of William Basset, they had no children. He married secondly Ursula, daughter of Sir Robert Austen and widow of George Stowel. They had two children: *a daughter. *Henry (1674‚Äì1714), was created a baronet at the age of seven (while his father still lived) by Charles II 4 July 1681.

It was followed a year later by the Shrine Building (Miami, Florida), an application of Art Deco with local Seminole Indian motifs added as an interesting twist. Both were covered in a 1988 study of Downtown Miami historic resources, but were not NRHP-listed due to owner objections at the time. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in August 8, 1997. Only its tower remains. After the area's drastic decline in the early 1980s, the building's intense structural decay, and declining sales, the store closed for good in 1983. The building remained vacant and abandoned and was the subject to graffiti and vandalism. Sears was unable to sell the property and it donated the site to Dade County in 1992. That same year, the Sears signs were removed. The building listing was added to the National Register on August 8, 1997.

Life Malins was born at 7 Askew Place, Worcester on 21 October 1844. He emigrated to Philadelphia, USA, with his wife in 1866 and found work as a painter of railway wagons. As a result of his wife's ill health, they returned to Birmingham in 1868. When he returned to England, he brought back the Independent Order of Good Templars (IOGT), a temperance organization which he had joined in the US. The first English lodge was called Columbia No. 1 in Morton's Chapel, Cregoe Street, Birmingham, founded on 8 September 1868. He became president of the English Good Templars, though sometimes called despotic. From 1876 to 1887, the English and Irish Good Templars were in conflict with the Good Templars in America, as in 1875 the American body had adopted a policy of accepting de facto racial segregation of lodges in the American South after the American Civil War. For the reunion of the American and English lodges in 1887, Malins compromised by accepting segregation, but Malins and the Good Templars were uncompromising over temperance and regarded as extreme in England. Malins was in favour of Local Option votes for local areas, which could vote to go \\"dry\\". He opposed compensation for liquor licence owners and public management of retail liquor outlets. Malins supported the Liberal Party, but went from supporting the Liberal Unionists to supporting the Home Rule (for Ireland) Liberals. His support for candidates depended on their attitude to temperance. Malins' 1895 poem, \\"The ambulance down in the Valley\\", is describing the difference between prevention and cure. The poem is quoted in numerous modern day resources (e.g., Primary health care in Australia: A nursing and midwifery consensus viewPrimary health care in Australia: A nursing and midwifery consensus view. http://anmf.org.au/documents/reports/PHC_Australia.pdf). He died at home in Birmingham on 5 January 1926 and was buried in the Yardley Cemetery there. References *Joseph Malins - Patriarch Templar, by Joseph Malins, 1932, Templar Press, Birmingham.

The first permanent missionaries to the area arrived in 1834, and the district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The building is known as Wai‚Äòoli Mission House and is now a museum open to the public. Description Wai oli means \\"joyful water\\" or \\"singing river\\" in the Hawaiian language. In 1824, after the royal yacht Ha ªaheo o Hawai ªi (\\"Pride of Hawaii\\") ran aground in the bay, a crowd gathered for an attempt at salvage. Reverend Hiram Bingham took the opportunity to preach a sermon. Around 1832, a thatched hut was built in this area for the missionaries to Hawaii from the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions who would visit from other missions in the Hawaiian islands, such as the one at Waimea, Kauai. Early supporters were island governor Kaikioewa and Queen Dowager Deborah Kapule. The first permanent pastor was Reverend William Patterson Alexander (1805‚Äì1884), with his wife Mary Ann McKinney Alexander (1810‚Äì1888) who arrived in 1834. By then the original temporary structure had to be rebuilt. Alexander also started building a wood framed house about 1835. Their son Samuel Thomas Alexander was born here. After the second thatched church blew down in an 1837 storm, a frame building was begun and finished in 1841. The new church was a single rectangular structure by . Alexander also expanded his house for his growing family. While most mission houses are built in the New England style (including the interiors), this house shows influence of the Southern States. This is attributed to Alexander being born in Paris, Kentucky. Edward Johnson and his wife Lois Hoyt Johnson arrived in 1837 and opened a school. In 1843 George Berkeley Rowell (1815‚Äì1884) and his wife Malvina Jerusha Chapin Rowell (1816‚Äì1901) arrived and the Alexanders moved to Lahainaluna School. Abner Wilcox (1808‚Äì1869) and Lucy Eliza Hart Wilcox (1814‚Äì1869) arrived in 1847 as teachers after the Rowells moved to Waimea. Johnson became pastor of the church. By the end of the 1840s, the American Board removed funding for the missions and formed a Hawaiian Evangelical Association which tried to raise funds with small farms at each site. After the Great Mahele the Wilcox family obtained fee simple title to the property. The mission school became the Hanalei Public School. Abner and Lucy Wilcox both died while visiting relatives in Colebrook, Connecticut, in August 1869. Albert Spencer Wilcox lived in the house until 1877. In 1912 the current church building was built with donations from Sam, George, and Albert Wilcox (sons of the missionary couple, they were born at the station). The old 1841 church was used as the Mission Hall. The old mission bell was used in the belfry. In 1921 Wilcox descendants funded architect Hart Wood to restore the Mission House and the Mission Hall. By 1945 it merged with the Anini Church and the Haena Church to become the Huiia Church. Some of Abner Wilcox's library can still be seen in his study. In 1957 the Congregational Church organization became the United Church of Christ. Hui ia means \\"united\\" in the Hawaiian language. The district includes with the 1836 mission house, two caretaker cottages, and a garage, in addition to the 1841 Hall and 1912 Church. The house now is a small private museum.

Early life Born in a log cabin in Houston, Minnesota on October 22, 1899, Bidwell was the eldest of seven children. He was raised on a small farm, and at the age of sixteen was left with his father to raise the family when his mother died. Bidwell attended the University of Minnesota and served on the Columbia County Board of Supervisors for ten years. He was a farmer and an ice cream manufacturer. Career A member of the Republican Party, Bidwell was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly from 1953 to 1967 and served in the Wisconsin State Senate from 1971 to 1983. During his years in the Wisconsin State Legislature, Bidwell earned the reputation as an \\"Irishman with a short fuse and an inability to carry a grudge for very long.\\" While serving in the State Senate, Bidwell was the oldest serving legislator in the state. As a Wisconsin state senator, Bidwell served as the chairman of the Committee on industry, labor, taxation, and banking and the Senate Committee on Commerce during the 1970s. Bidwell was defeated for reelection by future United States Senator Russell Feingold. On the November 2, 1982 Senate Election day against Russ Feingold, Bidwell was declared the winner by a 19 vote margin. The recount started the day after the election and continued for three weeks. Two days after the election, Sauk County, Wisconsin uncovered 64 votes for Feingold that had not been counted on election night. Over forty additional votes for Feingold were also found on a broken voting machine in a North Madison school. The lead see-sawed back and forth until the very end. When all the votes had been recounted, in what was considered a major Republican Party of Wisconsin upset, Feingold defeated Bidwell by just 31 votes.

Its stated purpose is to educate the public about financial products and to push for policies that curb predatory lending. On its website and elsewhere, CRL describes its mission as that of ‚Äúprotecting homeownership and family wealth by working to eliminate abusive financial practices.‚Äù CRL is affiliated with the Center for Community Self-Help.  History  Established in 2002 by Self-Help, CRL is a nonprofit, nonpartisan research and policy organization that focuses on financial products and services, including mortgages, credit cards, payday lending, and bank overdraft fees. It is affiliated with the Self-Help Credit Union, also founded by Martin Eakes in Durham, N.C. It has issued research reports, issue briefs and policy statements on a range of topics. CRL has pushed hard for financial reform--including the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Agency--in the wake of the mortgage meltdown The founders of CRL are Herbert Sandler and his wife Marion Sandler, founders of the Sandler Foundation. The Sandlers have been heavily criticized for their role in the 2008 financial crisis. Their financial company, Golden West, was one of the many banks to offer the adjustable rate mortgages that were blamed for the subprime mortgage crisis. The Sandlers' ties to the financial crisis were detailed by CBS's 60 Minutes. Martin Eakes, the current CEO of CRL and Self-Help, describes the mission of the organization as follows: \\"The economic problems we've seen in subprime lending came about through a narrow focus on self-enrichment among brokers, lenders and investors on Wall Street. We must redefine success to include the common good, and recognize that we are all enriched through sustainable lending that strengthens families and communities.\\"http://images.businessweek.com/ss/10/03/0323_powerful_real_estate_people/15.htm  Lobbying Work  An investigation by Politico revealed CRL had a heavy role in helping the CFPB draft new regulations on payday loans. According to POLITICO, \\"The group regularly sent over policy papers, traded emails and met multiple times with top officials responsible for drafting the rule. At the same time, the group‚Äôs financial services business, Self Help Credit Union, was pushing CFPB to support its own small-dollar loan product with a much lower interest rate as an alternative to payday loans.\\" CRL opposed the Mortgage Choice Act of 2013 (H.R. 3211; 113 Congress), a bill that would direct the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to amend its regulations related to qualified mortgages to reflect new exclusions made by this bill. The CRL called the bill a \\"bill that would threaten the safety of home loans and leave consumers vulnerable to excessive fees.\\" According to the CRL, the bill \\"would allow the fees from affiliated title companies to be exempt from the fee limits in the definition of a Qualified Mortgage.\\" Influence on Operation Choke Point An investigation by the House Oversight Committee found that the Federal Deposit and Insurance Commission took a prominent role in Operation Choke Point, an interagency initiative to pressure banks to stop providing business services to industries such as payment processors, firearms sellers, payday lenders etc. As members of the FDIC‚Äôs Advisory Committee on Economic Inclusion, CRL board member Wade Henderson pushed agency leadership to crack down on the payday lending industry‚Äîone of the industries targeted by Operation Choke Point. Additionally, according to emails uncovered by the Oversight investigation, Mark Pearce (former CRL president and current director of FDIC‚Äôs Division of Depositor and Consumer Protection), was exploring ways for FDIC to ‚Äúget at payday lending.‚Äù The report found Pearce used his position to push for stringent regulations on the payday lending industry. CRL praised efforts by Operation Choke Point to increase regulations on payday lenders.

Canavarro House, also known as the Canavarro Castle, at 2756 Rooke Ave., Honolulu, Hawaii, was built in 1924-1927 for Georges de Souza Canavarro, son of the longtime Consul-General of Portugal in Hawaii, Antonio de Souza Canavarro. It was designed by Hart Wood, the leader of a group of architects aiming to develop a style suitable for the climate and lifestyle of the islands. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 as a fine example of the Mediterranean Revival style employed for several large estates of that era, most notably Walter F. Dillingham's La Pietra. The design in this case was inspired by Sicilian villas. The house site is on a steep slope in the Puunui area of Nuuanu Valley, next to the Oahu Country Club, with expansive views up the Valley and down to Honolulu harbor. The roofing is covered with red tiles, the masonry walls are covered with white stucco both inside and out, and the terraced floors and terraced grounds give the impression of a hillside town above the Mediterranean. The house itself is cross-shaped with an open courtyard and fountain in the center. The master bedroom, bath, and parlor are on the uphill side above the courtyard, with dining room, kitchen, and pantry on the downhill side. The north wing contains a library and two more bedrooms with separate baths. The interior floors are tiled and ceilings are coffered. In 1947, the Canavarro Castle was purchased by the Korean Kook Min Hur (National Association), but subsequently fell into disuse. In 2002, the Korean Cultural Center of Hawaii bought the property and restored it for use as a meeting site and museum of the Korean independence movement.

The Fiesta de las Cruces (\\"Festival of the Crosses\\") or Cruz de Mayo (\\"May Cross\\") is a holiday celebrated on the 3rd of May in many parts of Spain and Hispanic America. Origins Religiously, the festival is rooted in the search by Byzantine Empress Saint Helena for the cross on which Jesus died, but the popular traditions connected to the festival certainly originate from pagan traditions brought to Spain by the Roman Empire (see May Day). The legend is that Emperor Constantine I, in the sixth year of his reign, confronted the barbarians on the banks of the Danube, in a battle where victory was believed to be impossible because of the great size of the enemy army. One night, Constantine had a vision of a cross in the sky, and by it the words \\"In hoc signo vincis\\" (With this sign, you shall be victorious). The emperor had a cross made and put it at the front of his army, which won an easy victory over the enemy multitude. On returning to the city and learning the significance of the cross, Constantine was baptized as a Christian and gave orders to construct Christian churches. He sent his mother, Saint Helena, to Jerusalem in search of the True Cross, the cross on which Jesus died. Once there, Helena summoned the wisest priests to aid in her attempt to find the cross. On Calvary Hill, traditionally considered the site of Jesus's crucifixion, she found three bloody logs hidden. In order to discover which was the True Cross, she placed the logs one by one over sick people, and even dead people, who were cured or resuscitated at the touch of the True Cross. The veneration of the True Cross, and the use of pieces of the True Cross as relics, begins at this time. Santa Helena died praying for all believers in Christ to celebrate the commemoration of the day the Cross was found.  Places where the holiday is celebrated  The \\"Fiesta de las Cruces\\" is celebrated in numerous places in Spain and Hispanoamerica. = Spain = Cruz de mayo de la Cuesta del Bail√≠o, 2005, C√≥rdoba, Spain. Various groups of people - usually linked to the Hermandades, the religious Brotherhoods who organise the Easter Week processions, get together and decorate a tall cross with flowers. They choose a pretty square or street, and also decorate the area around the cross with typical and traditional items. A guitar. An embroidered shawl. Old earthenware pots. Even an old-fashioned sewing machine! For the cross of the Hermandad de Nuestra Se√±ora del Carmen, Queen of the Sea, they use fishing nets and tackle. For San Isidro the Ploughman Saint, they have crops and traditional foodstuff. They set out these beautiful items, redolent of the past and of the traditions of the town, making an artistic display that everyone comes to admire. Although it is normally one of the Brotherhoods decorating the crosses, it can also be a group of friends and neighbours, a youth group, a Charity, who get together to produce these lovely events.

The origin of this celebration is uncertain, but it may go back as much as 500 years. One of its peculiarities is that instead of a procession centered on a cross, there is a procession of the Virgin of Sorrows dressed in sky blue to celebrate Christ's victory over death. The statue of the Virgin is displayed, successively in three aspects: as the mother of Jesus, as the Dolorosa accompanying Jesus to Calvary, and because May is her month * Santa Cruz de La Palma (Santa Cruz de Tenerife).

That celebration begins at 6 p.m. on 2 May with a celebration of the eucharist in honor of the Holy Cross. On 3 May people begin to gather at 3 a.m. and parade through the streets of various municipalities of the department, after which there are various sporting activities (including mountain biking and a marathon). At noon, roughly 3,000 construction workers gather for lunch at FFACSA's various branch offices (in Quetzaltenango, Sacatep√©quez, Totonicap√°n) and at their central site in Chimaltenango. After lunch there are raffles, with prizes such as motorcycles, bicycles, televisions, DVD players, and household appliances.

The holiday is celebrated in Mexico mainly by guilds and unions involved in construction. A cross adorned with flowers and paper is placed in a high position on a building in the process of construction. The workers then celebrate with local cuisine and alcoholic beverages such as tequila, mezcal, and local beer. = Peru = * Jun√≠n (Jun√≠n Province, Jun√≠n Region) * Cerro de Pasco (Pasco Province, Pasco Region) * Huancayo (Huancayo Province, Jun√≠n Region) * Amazonas Region * Chupaca Province (Jun√≠n Region) * Ayacucho (Huamanga Province, Ayacucho Region) * Puno (Puno Province, Puno Region) * Huancavelica (Huancavelica Region) * Ica Region * Roman Catholic Diocese of Tacna y Moquegua, comprising the lay administrative regions Tacna Region and Moquegua region = Venezuela = * Choron√≠, Aragua State has a celebration of great importance and tradition.

This celebration is not considered an official government or church holiday; it only marks the beginning of the \\"wet\\" or rainy season in winter. It is a tradition that dates back to prehispanic times during which the indigenous people of the region (Pipiles) offered food to give thanks to the gods and Mother Earth for what they provided. The cross was added when the tradition fused with Catholicism during the colonial period. The cross is made from wood, and decorated with flowers and long chains of colorful tissue paper. Fruits, grains, vegetables, drinks, candies and sometimes money are placed at the foot of the cross as offerings. Visitors to the household are invited to take offerings with them after they kneel in front of the cross and recite a thanksgiving prayer. = Trinidad = In Lopinot, Trinidad, parang is performed at the Cruz de Mayo (May Cross) festival, a ritual whose performance strongly mirrors the contemporary Santa Rosa Festival and was likely the source of its patterning. The Cruz de Mayo celebrates the month of Mary, and is also when the maypole is performed, which has even more significance for the Caribs as it was amalgamated into their traditions of weaving the sebuc√°n, their cassava strainer (the dance around the maypole, weaving the ribbons together, is seen as mimicking the weaving of the sebuc√°n).Review of the Indigenous Caribbean, accessed 2012-08-28.

Early life and the Russian Revolution Yakov Antipov was born in the village of Novosavitskaya (nowadays part of the unrecognized Trans-Dniester Republic) to Yakov Antipov, a railway worker, and Smaragda Dimitrievna. The date of his birth is unsure. According to his own declaration on the occasion of his arrest in 1926, he was born in 1899, while his Siguran»õa (Romanian secret police) file noted 7 April 1899 as his birth date. However, an article published in 1926 in the newspaper Izvestia of Odessa, mentions 1892 as the year of his birth, while several late Soviet sources present April 1901 as the month of his birth.Great Soviet Encyclopedia In 1902 the whole family relocated to Bendery. At the age of 14 he began working as an apprentice in the local railway workshops, around this time becoming a supporter of socialism. After finishing a local high school in 1917, he left for Petrograd to enrol in Law school. There he joined the Russian revolutionary movement, adopting the pseudonym Tcacenco. He participated in the Russian Revolutions of February and October. In August 1917 he joined the Red Guards and fought against the forces of White general Lavr Kornilov. In late 1917 Tcacenco returned to Bendery, where he helped organise the local supporters of the Bolsheviks, and became one of the leaders of the revolutionary youth organisation. Activism in Romania After Bessarabia joined Greater Romania, a large part of the communist organisation in Chi»ôinƒÉu, the Bessarabian capital, was arrested by the new authorities and put under trial in the Trial of the 108. Tcacenco received the task of restoring the organisation, and in October 1919 he was elected secretary of the Chi»ôinƒÉu communist committee. Later he would be elected secretary of the regional organisation of the party in Bessarabia. Tcacenco was one of the founders of an illegal typography in Chi»ôinƒÉu, and was the editor of Bol»ôevicul basarabean (\\"The Bessarabian Bolshevik\\", in Moldavian), and Bessarabskiy kommunist (\\"The Bessarabian Communist\\", in Russian). He also contributed to the restoration of the communist youth organisation in the main city of Bessarabia, and tightened contacts with the local communist-influenced trade unions. At the same time, Tcacenco established contacts with Alecu Constantinescu, a leading member of Bucharest's nascent communist movement. The contacts between the two organisations were however soon interrupted as Tcacenco was arrested in Chi»ôinƒÉu on 6/7 August 1920, along with several communist activists. Tcacenco succeeded in escaping custody on 17 August 1920, leaving for Ia»ôi. On 19 February 1921, the Chi»ôinƒÉu court-martial convicted him in absentia to death. In Ia»ôi, Tcacenco assisted in the organisation of the still chaotic local workers' movement. In March 1921 he participated at the Ia»ôi Conference of communist organisations, and was elected in the central committee of the Conference. During the debates, he supported the creation of an unified communist movement, part of the Socialist Party of Romania, and opposed the creation of several provincial parties, as proposed by other delegates. He and most of the delegates to the Conference were arrested by the Romanian authorities on 26 March and during the following days. Tcacenco was included in the group of communists tried in the Dealul Spirii Trial (January‚ÄìJune 1922), when the National-Liberal government attempted to eliminate the Communist Party by making it responsible for a bomb attack on the Romanian Senate by anarchist Max Goldstein. During the trial, Tcacenco acknowledged he had participated in distributing communist newspapers and manifestos, but denied any connection with the bomb attack. Most of the defendants were ultimately amnestied under public pressure, however Tcacenco received a 2-year jail sentence. The Supreme Council of Re-examination annulled the sentence on 22 September, and disposed a retrial to take place at the War Council of the 5th Army Corps, in Constan»õa. As the legal proceedings were delayed, Tcacenco escaped custody again on 2 April 1923, and left for Bucharest. He joined the local communist movement, however he was quickly re- apprehended by the authorities. Back in Constan»õa, the court decided his 1921 activities had a political character, thus falling under the royal amnesty of 1922. Nevertheless, he was not set free, as he was sent to Chi»ôinƒÉu for a retrial of the February 1921 decision. In August 1923 the sentence was quashed, but Tcacenco was ordered to leave the country in 30 days. He subsequently fled Romania, settling temporarily in Prague, Czechoslovakia. Exile and demise Tcacenco eventually made his way into the Soviet Union, where he worked for the Joint State Political Directorate in Moscow. In February 1924 Tcacenco, Grigory Kotovsky, Solomon Timov and other Bessarabian and Romanian communists sent a letter to the Central Committees of the Communist Parties of Russia and Ukraine, requesting the formation of a Moldovan national territory. Soon after, a Moldavian Autonomous Oblast would be created on the left bank of the Dniester, on the territory of the Ukrainian SSR. Later that year, Tcacenco left for Vienna, where he worked for the apparatus of the Comintern. In August 1924, at the Third Congress of the Communist Party of Romania, he was elected a member in the Central Committee, and in March and April 1925 he represented the party in the Executive Committee of the Communist International. There he participated in the political, trade union and peasant commissions. Tcacenco returned to Romania for a short time in July 1925, reintegrating in the local communist movement, however he fled again to Prague as he was notified of an imminent arrest. He succeeded in coming back to Bucharest in 1926, despite a Siguran»õa order disposing his arrest at the border. In Romania, he agitated for the Workers' and Peasants' Bloc, a legal front organization of the Romanian Communist Party during the 1926 electoral campaign. Tcacenco was a supporter of a united front comprising, besides the Bloc, the Peasants' Party, the National Party and the People's Party. On 15 August 1926, during a meeting with communist leaders Boris Stefanov and Timotei Marin, the group was surrounded by the police. Tcacenco was shot, but succeeded in escaping, only to be captured later that day. He was sent to Tighina for trial, but never appeared before the court, as he was killed by the Romanian secret police. The exact details of his death are disputed. According to one version, he was killed by the Siguran»õa in Chi»ôinƒÉu. Another version posits that he escaped his guards in Chi»ôinƒÉu with the help of local communists, only to be captured the following days near Soroca, while attempting to cross the Dniester River in the Soviet Union, and executed. According to a third account, he was shot in Vesterniceni, near Chi»ôinƒÉu, while attempting to escape. The location of his remains is unknown. Legacy After World War II, as the Romanian Communist Party gained power in Romania, Tcacenco was honoured by the official propaganda along other young communists killed by the previous Romanian governments. After 1970, they were all gradually removed from official discourse, as the personality cult of president Nicolae Ceau»ôescu singularised the Romanian leader as a hero of the communist youth. Tcacenco was also celebrated in the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic. His name was adopted for several enterprises, cultural institutions, and streets bore his name in Chi»ôinƒÉu, Bender, and Tiraspol. A monument and a museum dedicated to Tcacenco are found in Bender, while a bust was placed in Tiraspol.
