Early life Ellery was born in Cranleigh, Surrey, England, the son of John Ellery, a surgeon, and his wife Caroline, née Potter. Ellery was educated at the local grammar school and qualified as a medical practitioner, but he had an early interest in astronomy. Friends at Greenwich Observatory encouraged him and he had some access to instruments there.  Career  Ellery sailed for Victoria in 1851 attracted by the discovery of gold, and is stated to have practised as a physician at Williamstown, Victoria. If so it could only have been for a very short period, as in 1853 the Victorian government decided to found an astronomical observatory as a service to shipping, whose navigators relied critically on accurate astronomical time for determination of their longitude and appreciated the opportunity to synchronise their chronometers. Ellery had already established a reputation as a astronomer and in July 1853 was put in charge of the facility. The Victorian government observatory was at first on a very modest scale, being housed in a small two-roomed cottage at Williamstown, and the only instruments were a sextant, an artificial horizon and a marine chronometer. However, by March 1854, a 30-inch transit instrument, a good astronomical clock and a time-ball apparatus had been added, and a few meteorological instruments were also obtained. Ellery's workload was not heavy, and he also undertook for a time the duties of storekeeper of the marine depot. In 1856 he began a geodetic survey of Victoria which was not completed until 1874. At the beginning of 1858 the government founded another observatory known as the magnetic observatory on Flagstaff Hill, West Melbourne, under a distinguished German scientist, Georg von Neumayer, who had applied for a site in the Domain south of the Yarra without success. Both Ellery and Neumayer found that the sites given them were not suitable for their work, but it was not until 1863 that a move was made to the Domain. Edward John White, an able astronomer, was added to Ellery's staff in May 1860, and several valuable catalogues of stars were prepared and published. Melbourne Observatory played a crucial role in the 1862 determination of the distance from the earth of the sun, which involved close cooperation between Ellery and E. J. Stone of Greenwich. In 1868 a new telescope was sent out from England but the results obtained with it were unsatisfactory. Ellery resolved the issues he had with the telescope by applying his mechanical ability to the problems involved. Ellery had an able assistant in Ebenezer Farie Macgeorge (born 1836), who had been his surveyor in 1867 when he defined the boundary between South Australia and New South Wales, then replaced Albert Le Sueur as his observer, serving from 1870 to 1872. In March 1871 he reported to the Royal Society of Victoria that since Le Sueur's polishing of the Great Melbourne Telescope the chief limitation to observation was the atmosphere, not the instrument. At the end of 1890, another telescope arrived and Ellery began a new important piece of work, the preparation of the share allotted to Melbourne of the astrographic chart. He retired in 1895 and was succeeded by Pietro Baracchi. Later life In addition to his own work Ellery had much to do with educational and scientific bodies. He was one of the founders of the Royal Society of Victoria and its president from 1866 to 1884, became a trustee of the public library, museums and National Gallery of Victoria in 1882, and was also for many years a member of the council of the University of Melbourne. He was interested in the volunteer movement and in 1873 organized the Victorian torpedo corps, afterwards the submarine mining engineers. He was in command until 1889, when he retired with the rank of lieutenant colonel. In 1900, Ellery was elected president of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science; he chose as the subject of his address \\"A Brief History of the Beginnings and Growth of Astronomy in Australasia\\". Ellery was the first president of the Victorian Beekeepers' Club in 1885, and edited the Australian Beekeepers' Journal. Early in 1907 Ellery had a paralytic stroke, but recovered well and was in fair health until shortly before his death at Melbourne on 14 January 1908. Ellery wrote many papers for scientific journals some of which were re-issued as pamphlets. Some of the catalogues of stars and other work done under his supervision at the observatory were published, but at the time of his death much remained in manuscript. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, London, in 1873, and was created C.M.G. in 1889. He was married twice, to two sisters, daughters of Dr John Shields. He left a widow and a daughter. Ellery was awarded the Clarke Medal by the Royal Society of New South Wales in 1889. Mount Ellery in Antarctica was named after him in 1886.  References  Bibliography S. C. B.

Fort Ward was a Confederate States of America fort located in Wakulla County, Florida, at the confluence of the Wakulla River and St. Marks River and named after Colonel George T. Ward, owner of Southwood Plantation, Waverly Plantation, and Clifford Place Plantation south of Tallahassee. During the American Civil War, Confederate troops placed a battery of cannons at Fort Ward.  History  The site on which Fort Ward stands was originally a camp site of Spanish explorer Pánfilo de Narváez, in 1528, when he ventured north from Tampa. Narváez saw that the area was advantageous in a geographic sense. In 1539, Hernando de Soto followed with his men. By 1679, the Spanish governor of Florida started construction on the first fort (named Fort San Marcos de Apalache)Morris, Allen and Joan Perry Morris, compilers. The Florida Handbook 2007–2008 31st Biennial Edition. Page 444. Peninsula Publishing. Tallahassee. 2007. Softcover Hardcover using logs coated with lime to give the look of stone. The fort stood, until 1681, then was burned and looted by pirates. In 1719, Spanish Captain Jose Primo de Ribera arrived to construct a second wooden fort. The fort was called San Marcos de Apalache. The wood for construction was cut at Mission San Luis de Apalachee to the north. As a stone fort, its construction began in 1739. The old moat at Fort Ward. The fort was turned over to the English in 1763, half complete, as a result of the Seven Years' War. Spain regained control and ownership, by 1787, reoccupying it for 13 more years. In 1800, a former British officer named William Augustus Bowles attempted to unify and lead 400 Creek Indians against the Spanish, eventually capturing San Marcos. A Spanish flotilla arrived some five weeks later and re-assumed control of the fort. In 1818, General Andrew Jackson invaded the territory and took San Marcos after raids originating in Spanish Florida had a deep impact in Georgia. Two captured British citizens, Robert Christy Ambrister and Alexander George Arbuthnot, were tried and found guilty of inciting Indian raids and executed, causing a diplomatic nightmare between the United States and England. In 1821, Florida became the property of the United States and the fort was occupied by U.S. troops. In 1824, the fort was abandoned by the U.S. and turned over to the Territory of Florida. By 1839, the fort was returned to the U.S. and a federal marine hospital was built there 18 years later, using stones from the Spanish fort. The hospital provided care for victims of yellow fever. In 1861, the final conflict took place at San Marcos when the Confederates took the fort and renamed it Fort Ward. From 1861–1865, a Union squadron blockaded the mouth of the St. Marks River. The Battle of Natural Bridge eventually stopped the Union force that intended to take Fort Ward.

Legends =Birth and Early Life= Pururavas was born in Treta Yuga as the son of Budha and Ila. Budha was the son of Chandra, the moon god and thus Pururavas was the first Chandravanshi King. Since he was born on Mount Puru, he was called Pururavas. =Reign= According to the Puranas, Pururavas reigned from Pratisthana (PrayagWilson, H.H. (1840). The Vishnu Purana, Book IV, Chapter I, footnote 7.). He performed a penance to Lord Brahma and as a reward, he was made the sovereign of the whole earth. Pururavas celebrated a hundred Ashwamedha Yajnas. The Asuras were his followers while, the Devas were his friends. =Pururavas and Urvashi= Urvashi and Pururavas, a painting by Raja Ravi Varma In the Mahabharata, Pururavas fell in the apsara Urvashi. Urvashi married him on three conditions. Pururavas agreed them and they spent many years together. Indra started to miss Urvashi and created circumstances where all three conditions were broken. Urvashi left Pururavas, which left him heartbroken.https://www.blush.me/unwind/the-tragic-love-story-of-urvashi-an- apsara-and-king-pururavas-a-mortal Descendants He had six (or seven or eight according to different accounts) sons. The names of these sons are: Ayu (or Ayus), Amavasu,Pargiter, F.E. (1972). Ancient Indian Historical Tradition, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, pp.85–6. Vishvayu, Shrutayu, Shatayu (or Satayu), and Dridhayu. Nahusha, the son of Ayu, is a well-known name in the Rigveda.Misra, V.S. (2007). Ancient Indian Dynasties, Mumbai: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, , pp.59–61 Narrative of Urvashi and Purūravas The earlier version of the narrative of Urvashi and Pururavas is found in the Rigveda (X.95.1–18) and the Śatapaṭha Brāhmaṇa (XI.5.1). The later versions are found in the Mahābhārata, the Harivaṃsa, the Viṣṇu Purāṇa, the Matsya Purāṇa,Dandekar, R.N. (1962). Indian Mythology in S. Radhakrishnan ed. The Cultural Heritage of India, Calcutta: The Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, , pp.229–30, 230ff and the Bhāgavata Purāṇa. =In Vedic literature= The Ṛg-veda, X.129 contains a conversational fragment, written in a highly wrought poetic style. The hymn suggests that Uṣas (also known as Urvaśi) is a Gandharvi or Apsara (an aquatic nymph). Having been united with a human king, Purūravas, and after living together for four autumns, suddenly left him on his unintentional violation of the stipulated conditions of the union. Later Purūravas made futile entreaties to her to return to him. The narrative displays multiple levels of symbolism by playing on the multiplicity of meanings in the Vedic Saṃskṛt terms. While it is a love poem, expressing the conflict of interest between a lover and his beloved, who spurns his love, it also expresses the immortal relationship between the Sun (Purūravas) and the Dawn (Uṣas). In addition to these two levels of meaning, it also offers mantric prescriptions for a ritual activity bent on taking rebirth as a Gandharva or Apsaras. =In Later Literature= The love story of king Pururavas and celestial nymph Urvashi is found in the Sanskrit drama, Vikramōrvaśīyam, written by the celebrated poet Kalidasa. The story is more dramatized and with variations from the original story. Notes References *A Dictionary of Hindu Mythology & Religion by John Dowson *Gaur, R.

Denmead & Son; launched on 4 May 1865; and completed on 21 October 1865. Waxsaw was a Casco-class, light-draft monitor intended for service in the shallow bays, rivers, and inlets of the Confederacy. These warships sacrificed armor plate for a shallow draft and were fitted with a ballast compartment designed to lower them in the water during battle. Design revisions Though the original designs for the Casco-class monitors were drawn by John Ericsson, the final revision was created by Chief Engineer Alban C. Stimers following Rear Admiral Samuel F. Du Pont's failed bombardment of Fort Sumter in 1863. By the time that the plans were put before the Monitor Board in New York City, Ericsson and Simers had a poor relationship, and Chief of the Bureau of Construction and Repair John Lenthall had little connection to the board. This resulted in the plans being approved and 20 vessels ordered without serious scrutiny of the new design. $14 million US was allocated for the construction of these vessels. It was discovered that Stimers had failed to compensate for the armor his revisions added to the original plan and this resulted in excessive stress on the wooden hull frames and a freeboard of only 3 inches. Stimers was removed from the control of the project and Ericsson was called in to undo the damage. He was forced to raise the hulls of the monitors under construction by 22 inches to make them seaworthy. Fate As a result, the Navy Department ordered on 24 June 1864 that Waxsaw's deck be raised to provide sufficient freeboard. Upon delivery, the monitor was laid up at the Philadelphia Navy Yard; and she saw no commissioned service. She was renamed Niobe on 15 June 1869. She would be broken up at New York, NY by John Roach on 25 August 1875.

The ritual symbolises the act of honoring the person as a vessel of the female or male version of Deity. Each kiss given is accompanied by a blessing: > :Blessed be thy feet, that have brought thee in these ways :Blessed be thy > knees, that shall kneel at the sacred altar :Blessed be thy [womb/phallus], > without which we would not be :Blessed be thy breasts/chest, formed in > [beauty/strength] :Blessed be thy lips, that shall utter the Sacred Names.

It was once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index but was purchased by France Télécom (now Orange S.A.) in 2000, which then adopted the Orange brand for all its other mobile communications activities. Orange UK merged with Deutsche Telekom's T-Mobile UK to form a joint venture, EE in 2010. EE continued to operate the Orange brand until February 2015, when new connections and upgrades on Orange tariffs were withdrawn. Existing Orange customers could continue on their plans until March 2019. History =Background: 1990–1994= The inception of the Orange brand occurred in 1990 in the United Kingdom with the formation of Microtel Communications Ltd, a consortium initially formed by Pactel Corporation (American), British Aerospace, Millicom and Matra (French); and later wholly owned by BAe. In July 1991, the Hong Kong-based conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa, through a stock swap deal with BAe, acquired a controlling stake of 65% in Microtel, who by then had won a license to develop a personal communications network in the United Kingdom. As part of the deal, BAe gained a 30% stake in Hutchison Telecommunications (UK) Ltd. =Launch of Orange and expansion: 1994–1999= Hutchison renamed Microtel to Orange Personal Communications Services Ltd on 28 March 1994; and on 28 April 1994, the Orange 1800MHz GSM network was launched. The Orange brand, at the time an unusual name for a telecommunications firm, was created by a team at Microtel led by Chris Moss (marketing director) and supported by Martin Keogh, Rob Furness and Ian Pond. The brand consultancy Wolff Olins was charged with designing the brand values and logo, and advertising agency WCRS created the slogan \\"The future's bright, the future's Orange\\". The team that launched Orange in the UK was led by Malcolm Way, and later Hans Snook who became the chief executive. A holding company structure was adopted in 1995 with the establishment of Orange plc. In April 1996, Orange went public and floated on the London Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, majority owned by Hutchison (48.22%), followed by BAe (21.1%). In June 1996, it became the youngest company to enter the FTSE 100, valued at £2.4 billion. By July 1997 Orange had gained one million customers. =Acquisition of Orange and part of France Télécom: 1999–2009= The stint as a public company came to an end in October 1999, when it was acquired for US$33 billion by the German conglomerate Mannesmann AG. Mannesmann's acquisition of Orange triggered Vodafone to make a hostile takeover bid for the German company. Shortly thereafter, in February 2000, Vodafone acquired Mannesmann for US$183bn and divested Orange, as EU regulations would not allow it to hold two mobile licences. In May 2000, France Télécom announced the acquisition of the global operations of Orange from Vodafone for US$37bn, and the transaction was completed in August 2000. France Télécom subsequently rebranded all its mobile telecommunications as Orange. The company was initially 100% owned by France Télécom (although there were and remain minority investors in some of the national operating companies). In 2001 15% was sold in an IPO, but in 2003 the outstanding shares were bought back by France Télécom. =Merger with T-Mobile UK: 2009–2015= On 8 September 2009, France Télécom and T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom announced they were in advanced talks to merge their UK operations to create the largest mobile operator, which would have 37% of the market. The Orange brand was to be retained for the first eighteen months at least. Consumer Focus and the Communications Consumer Panel sent a joint letter to the then Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes in December 2009, asking for the merger to be investigated by authorities in the United Kingdom, rather than Brussels.Co-signed letter to European Competition Commissioner in relation to joint venture between Orange and T-Mobile Consumer Focus/Communications Consumer Panel. 21 December 2009 The British Office of Fair Trading joined this call by asking the EU to allow it to investigate the proposed deal in February 2010, saying that it believed the merger could have a 'significant' effect on competition. On 1 March 2010 the European Commission approved the merger, on condition that the combined company sell 25% of the spectrum it owned on the 1800 MHz radio band, and amend a network sharing agreement with smaller rival 3. On 1 April 2010 Deutsche Telekom and France Télécom completed the merger of their UK operations, causing Orange UK and T-Mobile UK to cease to exist, although the brands were to be maintained until 2015 for new customers, and 2019 for existing customers. On 11 May 2010 it was announced that both the Orange and T-Mobile brands would remain on British high streets, although their new merged parent company would be called EE. Orange's broadband service was rebranded as EE Broadband on 30 October 2012. =Phase- out of brand: 2015-2019= In February 2015, Orange UK's parent company EE announced that Orange (along with T-Mobile) tariffs were withdrawn for new customers. Existing customers wishing to upgrade had to choose an EE price plan. Starting in July 2015, Orange pay-as-you-go customers also had the ability to dial premium rate and directory enquiries numbers withdrawn. Those who needed to call such services were advised to transfer to an EE plan. Remaining Orange customers were informed in early 2019 that they had to switch to an EE plan by March, or their services would be terminated. This marked the end of Orange service in the United Kingdom. Services Adjacent Orange and T-Mobile shops in Leeds in 2009. The two were later re-branded as EE stores. Orange UK offered pay-as-you-go and pay monthly service plans. As with other prepaid plans, pay-as-you-go customers could top-up their phone via a swipe card, over the internet, by voucher bought printed as a receipt from a till, or via a credit or debit card. Until the EE takeover, Orange UK operated GPRS, EDGE and 3G HSDPA services. This has since been merged with T-Mobile's network. Orange's 2G network covered 99% of the UK population, and was the largest integrated 3G/2.5G network in the UK. Orange claimed in 2008 that it spent up to £1.5 million per day investing in its network. In 2009, Orange UK decided to outsource its mobile network. Therefore, in March 2009, Nokia Siemens Networks was chosen to manage, plan, expand, optimise and provide maintenance services for the Orange UK 2G/3G mobile network for the next five years. Currently, Orange customers are only able to access the UK's biggest 3G network along with EE's standard 2G network. Customers that wish to use EE's 4G network, have to upgrade to EE from their Orange plan. Orange UK also provided DSL services under the same brand. Originally operated as Freeserve in the UK, it was bought-out by France Télécom, rebranded as Wanadoo and on 1 June 2006 Wanadoo was rebranded Orange. When Orange launched its DSL broadband service it offered it for 'free', joining TalkTalk in the foray for market share. The company attempted to converge its mobile and DSL broadband products and offered broadband services alongside its mobile services, at a subsidized rate (up to £15 off full price per month for Orange mobile customers in an Orange Broadband network area). Orange offered 'triple-play' services converging mobile, landline and DSL broadband. Orange UK on its most expensive broadband service used to offer a Livebox which integrates VoIP technology as well as WiFi, but in more recent times, this has been replaced by a Netgear router. =Price plans= In 2000, Orange introduced a limited plan called 'Out Here', designed for users who did not make a lot of calls but needed to keep in touch. For a one-off payment of £15, users received a SIM with five free texts every day for life without ever having to top up again, and an Orange-branded 'Out Here' drawstring bag. In April 2006, Orange changed its contract offering by offering four packages to customers, named Dolphin, Canary, Racoon and Panther. On some plans there were unlimited minutes (to landlines or Orange UK mobiles), texts or data. In addition to this Orange offered dedicated business plans: Solo and Sense (a sharer plan). Orange also offered 'magic numbers': unlimited free calls to other Orange UK mobiles on contract or \\"talk for an hour, pay for a minute\\" on PAYG. In April 2008, Orange extended its animals to pay-as-you-go customers, introducing Dolphin, Raccoon, Canary, Camel, and Monkey. Dolphin, Monkey and Canary offer bonuses, whilst Raccoon is a discounted call rate and Camel is for a call-abroad tariff giving discounted calls to foreign countries. Orange, like other mobile networks, offered an \\"Internet Everywhere\\" tariff on pay-as-you-go, pay monthly and business plans. The tariffs names for pay monthly were aligned with the animals' theme in May 2010 when Orange offered both Dolphin and Raccoon plans for internet use available on both 1 month and 12-month contracts. In August 2011, the price plans were revised, and names changed to Small, Medium, and Large. Similar to home broadband, Orange mobile customers received a £5 discount on their mobile broadband plan. The business plans remained as \\"Business Everywhere\\". The 12-month plans came with a USB modem (or dongle) for free. The customer was required to pay a small price for the dongle on the 1-month plans. A portable WiFi dongle could also be purchased, dubbed \\"Mobile WiFi\\". The service operated across the network's EDGE, 3G, HSDPA and HSUPA network and offered speeds of up to 3.6 Mbit/s. Orange announced in June 2008 that this speed would be increased to 7.2 Mbit/s in the top 30 UK cities and 14.4 Mbit/s in the top five cities. =Orange shops= An Orange Shop in London, UK Orange, like its competitors, operated a retail estate, with over 300 stores. These were branded as \\"The Orange Shop\\" and operated as an indirect sales channel. In September 2012, Orange's parent company EE announced that all Orange and T-Mobile stores were to be re-branded as EE stores by 30 October 2012, the launch date of their 4G network, offering products from all three brands of the company. There are now around 700 EE stores open in the UK. After February 2015, only EE products were available in stores. Marketing =Orange Gold Spots= Until 2012, at most cinemas across the UK, advertisements for Orange were shown directly before the film, after the other adverts and film trailers, to remind people to turn off their mobile phones if they hadn't done so already. These were officially known as 'Orange Gold Spots'. The adverts featured various celebrities including; Rob Lowe, Dennis Hopper, Macaulay Culkin, Patrick Swayze, Carrie Fisher, John Cleese, Ewan McGregor, and The A-Team. Throughout the sketch, a pair of fictional Orange executives, played by Brennan Brown and Steve Furst, manipulate an idea into film which promotes Orange through product placement, despite the product being completely 'out-of-place' (a mobile phone in a Western Film is one example); the catch line is \\"Don't let a mobile phone ruin your movie. Please switch it off.\\" After five years, Orange changed advertising agencies and replaced the fictional Orange Film Funding Board with adverts in which the characters now run a film studio, remaking classic films with mobile phone references inserted. In April 2010, Gold Spots featuring specific forthcoming films replaced the Orange Film Funding Board parodies. The new adverts, promoting specific movies released by 20th Century Fox, Walt Disney Pictures, Vertigo Films and Nu Image feature the stars of the movie filming scenes in-character with Orange product placement, before breaking character to complain. The first advert featured the cast of The A-Team, followed by a spot starring Jack Black in Gulliver's Travels, Jesse Eisenberg and Anne Hathaway in Rio, Potiche, The Muppets, The Expendables 2 and The Sweeney. In 2012, the Orange adverts were replaced with adverts for parent company EE, featuring Kevin Bacon. In addition to this Orange offered 'Orange Wednesdays' from 2003 until 2014. This enabled any Orange customer to apply for 2 for 1 cinema tickets at participating cinemas, by text message. This was a result of Orange attempting to increase cinema visits during the quiet weekly periods. The Orange Wednesdays promotion also allowed Orange customers a 2 for 1 main courses with complimentary appetizers at PizzaExpress restaurants. Both the cinema ticket and meal offers only required a text ticket from Orange, which is entered at point of purchase. EE announced on 11 December 2014 that the Orange Wednesday promotion will end on 25 February 2015. =Sponsorship= An Orange Arrows F1 car. Orange sponsored the Arrows Formula One team from 2000 until 2002. In spirit with Orange's commitment to cinema Orange sponsored the British Academy of Film and Television Arts Awards until 2012 which includes an award in its own name – the Orange Rising Star Award. Sponsorship switched to EE from 2013 onwards. Orange UK has also shown a commitment to music which has included partnering with the Glastonbury Festival to provide mobile charging facilities and offers a music bursary. =Slogans= In 2008, Orange's slogan, \\"The future's bright – the future's Orange\\" was dropped after many years by its CEO Tom Alexander in a bid to save its ailing fortunes. From July 2008 to 2013, \\"I am\\"' became the main slogan, shortened from \\"I am who I am because of everyone\\", however, subsidiary slogans were used to describe the company's products and services, for example \\"I am more focus, less fuzz\\" was used to describe the Samsung Soul handset. Controversies =Data protection= In 2007, Orange was found to be in breach of the Data Protection Act 1998 by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) after complaints from customers about the use of their personal information. Orange has since agreed to reinforce the requirements of the Act. The company was also criticised in the press for its handling of personal data, following complaints of Orange customer data being used by independent mobile sales companies in the practice of slamming. Orange denied any involvement. =Attempted price increases= In August 2009, Orange attempted to increase the cost of its services to customers already under contract. Users were informed that legally, they were allowed to cancel their contract, as this was a breach of contract. Orange reverted their decision, and the price hikes did not go ahead. In December 2011, Orange sent a text to its customer base to notify them that they were increasing monthly contract fees by just below RPI rates. They imposed a 4.34% increase, coming into effect on 8 January. It was identified that the clause that supposedly allowed Orange to increase by inflation mid-contract, clause 4.3.1, was flawed as it referenced a Statistical Office which no longer exists. Specifically, Orange referenced \\"the All Items Index of Retail Prices published by the Central Statistical Office in the Monthly Digest of Statistics\\". The complete Terms and Conditions are available here and here. Orange maintain that their inaccurate wording in previous contracts was legally binding but chose to settle all known court cases brought against them on this issue. Two years later, following its merger with T-Mobile, the combined companies again signalled their intention to increase the agreed tariffs of existing pay monthly customers. Clause 4.3.1 has now changed to disallow the customer from cancelling their contract if \\"we give you written notice to increase the charges (as a percentage) by an amount equal to or less than the percentage increase in the All Items Index of Retail Prices or any other statistical measure of inflation published by any government body authorised to publish measures of inflation from time to time, and published on a date as close as reasonably possible before the date on which we send you written notice\\". This led to many customers using the change of clause to cancel their mobile phone contracts with Orange. See also * Orange S.A.

Her charm and humour made her a popular guest at salons in Paris between the wars, standing out even in a social circle known for its flamboyant talkers. Life = Early life = Wilde, born in London three months after her uncle Oscar Wilde's arrest for homosexual acts, was the only child of Oscar's older brother, Willie, and his second wife, Sophie Lily Lees. Though Wilde had never met her uncle, she idolized him far more than she did her own father, who was violently alcoholic and died just a few years after her birth. This left her under the care of her mother and stepfather, translator Alexander Teixeira de Mattos, though at the time, her mother was “so impoverished that she could not afford to keep her at home” and sent young Wilde away to what she described as a “country convent.” Wilde spoke little of her childhood, with only one story ever told. As recorded by Parisian raconteuse Bettina Bergery, “when Dolly was very young, she used to like to take lumps of sugar, dip them in her pretty mother Lily's perfume, and eat them.” = World War I = In 1914, she travelled to France in order to drive an ambulance in World War I. About 1917 or 1918, while both were living in Paris, she had an affair with one of her fellow ambulance drivers, Standard Oil heiress Marion \\"Joe\\" Carstairs, who in the 1920s became a speedboat racer and was known as \\"the fastest woman on water.\\" Although she \\"revelled in\\" attracting both men and women, Wilde was a lesbian.Schenkar, 124. = Addictions and later life = Wilde drank to excess and was addicted to heroin. She went through several detoxification attempts, none successful; she emerged from one nursing-home stay with a new dependency on the sleeping pill paraldehyde, then available over-the-counter.Schenkar, 280-293. In 1939 she was diagnosed with breast cancer and refused surgery, seeking alternative treatments.Schenkar, 269. The following year, with the Germans approaching Paris, she fled to England.Rodriguez, 318. She died aged 45 in 1941, of \\"causes unascertainable\\", according to the coroner's inquest—possibly the cancer or possibly a drug overdose.Schenkar, 37-48. Relationship with Natalie Barney Wilde's longest relationship, lasting from 1927 until her death, was with openly lesbian American writer Natalie Clifford Barney, who was host of one of the best-known Parisian literary salons of the 20th century. Writing Dolly Wilde was regarded by many as a gifted storyteller and writer, but she never took advantage of these natural talents. She was supported mostly by the generosity of others and by a small inheritance from her stepfather; her only written works were translations--often uncredited and unpaid--and animated correspondence with her friends.

Suncook was a Casco-class, light-draft monitor intended for service in the shallow bays, rivers, and inlets of the Confederacy. These warships sacrificed armor plate for a shallow draft and were fitted with a ballast compartment designed to lower them in the water during battle. Design revisions Though the original designs for the Casco-class monitors were drawn by John Ericsson, the final revision was created by Chief Engineer Alban C. Stimers following Rear Admiral Samuel F. Du Pont's failed bombardment of Fort Sumter in 1863. By the time that the plans were put before the Monitor Board in New York City, Ericsson and Simers had a poor relationship, and Chief of the Bureau of Construction and Repair John Lenthall had little connection to the board. This resulted in the plans being approved and 20 vessels ordered without serious scrutiny of the new design. $14 million US was allocated for the construction of these vessels. It was discovered that Stimers had failed to compensate for the armor his revisions added to the original plan and this resulted in excessive stress on the wooden hull frames and a freeboard of only 3 inches. Stimers was removed from the control of the project and Ericsson was called in to undo the damage. He was forced to raise the hulls of the monitors under construction by 22 inches to make them seaworthy. Fate As a result, the Suncook was laid up at the Philadelphia Navy Yard from 1866 to 1874. Her name was changed to USS Spitfire on 15 June 1869, but she resumed the name Suncook on 10 August 1869. The monitor was broken up at Philadelphia in July 1874.

Students, starting in the fall of 2008, attended classes based on the letter of the day. Days could range from A-E, and each student's schedule may be different for each letter. This allowed students never to miss too many classes. For example, in past years, students with lab days on Fridays would have fewer lab days when it would be a three-day weekend because school was not in session on Friday. With the letter days, students schedules rotate and eliminate this issue by having a student have lab on a specific letter day. The current system that the high school employs is not much different from the letter schedule, but is significantly shortened. This is similar to the college system and helps prepare those for college. The school now relies upon a 4-day schedule with a total of eight periods, two of which are dropped every day. This way, a student's schedule rotates through four different options, having class periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the morning block, and having periods 5, 6, 7 and 8 in the afternoon, leaving out a morning and afternoon class each day. Every student, regardless of grade, also attends lunch at the same time, which is commonly known as Lunch and Learn. This time is not only utilized for lunch and social purposes, but for kids to receive extra help during their lunch from teachers who are available or meet with clubs and other activities.

The current principal of the school is Orit Rosen. The school was established in the 1960s, thanks to a donation given by the Meyerhoff family from Brazil, as a high school belonging to the Tel Aviv University. Handasaim offers only science electives such as Computer Science and Biotechnology and attracts students from all over the country due to its excellence. In 2005, due to Tel Aviv University's financial difficulties the school was sold to the Herzliya municipality and in 2008 the school moved to a new campus in Herzliya located near the 'Seven Stars' Mall and very close to two other schools: high school Hadash, and middle school Yad Giyora. The school is located next to a science center which was built especially for Handasaim, used by all high schools in Herzliya. The science center includes advanced labs for Physics, Chemistry, Robotics etc., and is the biggest science center used by high school students in Israel. The school supports programs such as FRC, FLL and Nachshon. The School offers three courses: Computer Science, Engineering and Biotechnology. Handasaim high school is the school with the most FIRST teams in Israel, and as of 2020, includes 12 FLL teams and an FTC team, all mentored by the members of the school's FRC team General Angels. A new robotics building on campus is currently under construction and will be used by the school's flagship team, General Angels. Handasaim is known to be the school from which the greatest number of soldier-students (atuda'im) graduates from all of the Israeli schools. The high school has been criticized for being over-funded and for minimizing the averages of other high-schools in the city, due to pulling student from the regular education system.

It is rare, with an incidence between 0.24 and 1.23 cases per million people.  Pathophysiology  Being idiopathic, IPH by definition has an unknown cause. It is thought to be an immune-mediated disease. The lung bleeding causes accumulation of iron, which in itself causes additional lung damage. Meanwhile, there is insufficient iron for inclusion into the haemoglobin molecules inside red blood cells which carry oxygen to body tissues for cellular respiration. Idiopathic pulmonary haemosiderosis can occur either as a primary lung disorder or as the sequela to other pulmonary, cardiovascular or immune system disorder. *PH1 involves PH with circulating anti-GBM antibodies. *PH2 involves PH with immune complex disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE. *PH3 involves no demonstrable immune system involvement. A distinct subset of patients with pulmonary hemosiderosis has hypersensitivity to cow's milk which result in formation of IgG antibodies against basement membrane. This is called Heiner syndrome. Mechanism of haemorrhage is similar to that observed in Goodpasture syndrome. = Related or similar conditions = There are many pulmonary problems that may seem to mimic haemosiderosis but do not necessarily include the deposits of iron into the lung. The deposition of iron in the lungs, occurring in the form of haemosiderin, is the defining characteristic of this illness. These other conditions may occur separately or together with haemosiderosis. :*Pulmonary fibrosis :*Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) :*Immune complex disease :*intra-alveolar bleeding Diagnosis Clinically, IPH manifests as a triad of haemoptysis, diffuse parenchymal infiltrates on chest radiographs, and iron deficiency anaemia. It is diagnosed at an average age of 4.5 plus or minus 3.5 years, and it is twice as common in females. The clinical course of IPH is exceedingly variable, and most of the patients continue to have episodes of pulmonary haemorrhage despite therapy. Death may occur suddenly from acute pulmonary haemorrhage or after progressive pulmonary insufficiency resulting in chronic respiratory failure. Treatment Corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment of IPH, though they are controversial and lack clear evidence in their favour. They are thought to decrease the frequency of haemorrhage, while other studies suggest that they do not have any effect on the course or prognosis of this disease. In either case, steroid therapy has significant side effects. Small trials have investigated the use of other medications, but none has emerged as a clear standard of care. This includes immune modulators such as hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine, and cyclophosphamide. 6-mercaptopurine as a long-term therapy may prevent pulmonary haemorrhage. A 2007 scientific letter. reports preliminary success in preventing pulmonary haemorrhage with the anti-oxidant N-acetylcysteine.  Prognosis  Death may occur rapidly with acute, massive pulmonary bleeding or over longer periods as the result of continued pulmonary failure and right heart failure. Historically, patients had an average survival of 2.5 years after diagnosis, but today 86% may survive beyond five years. History The condition was first described as \\"brown lung induration\\" by Rudolf Virchow in 1864 in patients after their death. Wilhelm Ceelen later correlated his findings to the clinical symptoms of two children who died of IPH in 1931. The first living patient was diagnosed by Jan Waldenström in 1944.

His father, Reuben Oscar Everett, was one of the first five law students at Duke and practiced law for 66 years until his death, in his law office, at age 92. His mother, Kathrine Everett, was one of the first women to graduate from the University of North Carolina School of Law, where she ranked at the head of her class and was the first woman to argue and win a case before the North Carolina Supreme Court. She practiced for 70 years, retiring at the age of 97. In 1954, the Everetts were the first family of lawyers sworn in together to the bar of the Supreme Court of the United States. Robinson O. Everett graduated magna cum laude in 1947 from Harvard University, at age 19. At Harvard Law School he was on the Harvard Law Review, graduating magna cum laude in 1950.

History FÉGARMY Arms Factory (FÉG) of Hungary started producing Walther PP/PPK clones in the late 1940s starting with their Model 48 which differed from the Walther PP only in minor details. By the late 1950s FÉG began making broader changes resulting in the PA-63, which uses the 9×18mm Makarov round. It quickly became standard issue to both Hungarian military and police forces. The military standard PA-63 version sports a two-tone polished aluminum frame with black slide, grips, trigger and hammer assembly. While unusual for military issue in that a reflective polish was used, it was chosen due to its relative cheapness as well as quicker build time. After the fall of communism in 1990, the Hungarian army and police units initiated a program to replace the PA-63 with pistols using the NATO-standard 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge, first the imported Jericho 941, followed by the domestically produced P9RC, but the PA-63 is still in service in Hungarian law enforcement. It has been largely phased out in Hungary, but due to the large number produced, they are a popular and affordable surplus firearm since they have begun to be imported to the west. Variants and derivatives Due to the PA-63's popularity and relative durability, FÉG later issued models using .32 ACP and .380 ACP caliber rounds, the FÉG AP7.65 and PMK-380 respectively. The AP7.65 is almost identical to the PA-63 except that it is chambered in 7.65mm Browning (.32 ACP) and is anodized not two toned. The PMK-380 is chambered in the .380 ACP cartridge with a blued titanium-aluminum alloy frame and blued steel slide. In 2000, FÉG began producing the Walther PPK/E under license from Walther. It is available in .22 LR, .32 ACP and .380 ACP. The Makarov label PA-63s sold in the United States are often advertised as \\"PA-63 Makarov.\\" This can lead some consumers to believe they are purchasing a Makarov pistol instead of a different pistol chambered for the same 9×18mm Makarov caliber. Though both pistols share lineage from the Walther PP/PPK, similar operating principles and use the same ammunition, the Makarov PM is a different design featuring all-steel construction and different lockwork. There are no parts in common between the FÉG PA-63 and the Makarov pistol.

History It followed the mythical First Crusade and the Second Crusade to Finland. Viborg Castle was established in 1293 on the site of destroyed Karelian fort as the easternmost outpost of the medieval Kingdom of Sweden. After the crusade Western Karelia remained under Swedish rule until the Treaty of Nystad in 1721. The name of the expedition is largely anachronic, and it was a part of the Northern Crusades. According to the Eric Chronicles (Erikskrönikan) the reason behind the expedition was pagan intrusions into Christian territories. According to the Eric Chronicles, the Swedes conquered 14 hundreds from the Karelians. Karelians had also been engaged in a destructive expedition to Sweden in 1257 which led Valdemar, King of Sweden (1250–1275) to request Pope Alexander IV to declare a crusade against them, which he agreed. Birger Magnusson, King of Sweden (1290 to 1318), stated in a letter of 4 March 1295 that the motive of the crusade was long-time banditry and looting in the Baltic Sea region by Karelians, and the fact that they had taken Swedes and other travellers as captives and then tortured them.

The municipality had 2 churches: Nordvik Church in the north and Hæstad Church in the south. History The municipality of Nordvik was established on 1 July 1917 when the northern part of Herøy Municipality was divided into two with Nordvik in the north and Herøy in the south. Initially, Nordvik had a population of 1,530. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1962, the municipality of Nordvik (population: 1,293) was merged with the part of Herøy Municipality on the island of Dønna (population: 19), most of Dønnes Municipality (population: 1,348), and the part of Nesna Municipality on the island of Løkta (population: 80) to become the new Dønna Municipality. Government All municipalities in Norway, including Nordvik, are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads.

History Grandy's was founded in 1972 by Walter E. Johnson and Rex E. Sanders, who became friends while working together as teenagers at a Dallas, Texas cafeteria. After launching and selling a successful chain of restaurants, the two young men created Grandy's, hoping to combine the efficiency of fast food with the ambiance of a full-service restaurant. Under the ownership of Saga Foods, Inc. a multi-concept restaurant firm who acquired Grandy's in 1983, Grandy's experienced its greatest growth surge, primarily in the 1980s, having at its zenith almost 200 stores. A buyout of Saga by Marriott Corporation led to a sell off of the Grandy's chain, along with other concepts owned by Saga, to American Restaurant Group. In the late 1990s, Grandy's, now over 20 years old, began to close older locations and remote markets that were underperforming. They retreated to the core markets of Texas and Oklahoma with a strong presence in southern Indiana and northern Kentucky. In 2000, American Restaurant Group sold Grandy's and three other subsidiaries to Spectrum Restaurant Group.Souper Salad and Grandy’s Sold to Captain D’s, LNC Ventures In July 2004, Steve Butts and Brian Bowen left Grandy's, leaving the restaurant chain without an executive to lead the chain. Monty Whitehurst took over, without experience running a restaurant chain. Within 12 months, the chain lost 18 stores and same store sales dropped 32%. Also under Whitehurst, many of Grandy's locations were exposed on local television stations for failing health inspections. This caused sales to drop and closing a number of units. Spectrum filed for bankruptcy in 2006 and put Grandy's up for sale. Souper Salad acquired Grandy's in 2007. Souper Salad filed for bankruptcy in 2011. On December 19, 2011 Grandy's was acquired by Captain D's for an undisclosed amount. In 2013 several of the restaurants were shut down due to failed health inspections. In September 2016, USRP closed 8 stores by not renewing leases that Grandy's, Inc. signed in 1996. In 2018, the original chicken restaurant in Denton, Texas that the founders opened and rebranded it the second Grandy's, closed. This left the city of Denton without a Grandy's. As of May 2019, Grandy's is franchised in six states, with 38 restaurants. Almost half of these locations are in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex.

In total Methven was on the books at the Baseball Ground for 31 years and represented the club, in one capacity or another, in over 1000 matches. Methven, though born in Ceres, Fife, first played senior football in Edinburgh, for Leith Athletic, Heart of Midlothian and St Bernard's. He joined a growing band of Scottish professionals in English football when he signed forms with Derby County at the end of the 1890-91 season. Under Harry Newbould Derby endured a period of great frustration, never fulfilling what talent that team had and Methven was involved in all the matches that mattered. In total he played 511 games and (was one of three players who) appeared in each of the three unsuccessful FA Cup appearances for the Rams, before taking the reins as manager immediately following Harry Newbould's departure in 1906. He last played for the club (at the age of 38) on 2 February 1907, in an FA Cup Second Round tie against Lincoln City, which Derby won 1-0. Methven was unable to stop the slide into the Second Division during his first season with the club and only converted the club's wayward fortunes when he persuaded the 36-year-old Steve Bloomer to return home from Middlesbrough in 1910, helping Derby County back to the First Division as deserved champions in 1912.

It lies at the southern foot of Blencathra, one of the more prominent fells in the northern Lake District, and to the north of the River Glenderamackin. Overview The name is of Norse origin and is a combination of thraell, meaning slave or serf, and kelda, meaning a spring or well.Etymology and Origins of the Name Threlkeld, the Threlkeld One-Name Study, accessed 17 Oct 2020. There was extensive Norse settlement in the area during the era of Viking expansion (790s-1066). Thraell was probably a reference to native Cumbrians subjugated by the incoming Norse. Historically a part of Cumberland, Threlkeld formerly had its own railway station on the Cockermouth, Keswick and Penrith Railway, on the opposite side of the valley, next to the (closed) Threlkeld Quarry, at the foot of Clough Head. Today the railway line is a footpath and cycle track. Three rows of terraced houses, which used to accommodate the quarry workers, stand near the station.

A calcareous glade is a type of ecological community that is found in the central eastern United States. Calcareous glades occur where bedrock such as limestone occurs near or at the surface, and have very shallow and little soil development. Because of the shallow soil and the extreme conditions created by it, trees are often unable to grow in the glades. This creates a habitat that is usually sunny, dry, and hot. Calcareous glade vegetation is more similar to that of a desert habitat than a grassland, being dominated by small spring annuals with occasional geophytic or succulent perennials. The usage of the words \\"glades\\" and \\"barrens\\" to describe dry, rocky communities in the United States is not uniform, and the terms are often used interchangeably. Calcareous glade communities can intergrade with dry rocky prairies, particularly in sloping habitats. Due to their unsuitability for agriculture, glade communities have survived to the present day at a higher rate than deeper-soil prairie communities. Interior Low Plateau glades The Interior Low Plateau is a region in the Upper South that is known for its calcareous glade communities. This region is centered in Tennessee and Kentucky, and extends into northern Alabama, and southern Illinois, southern Indiana, and southern Ohio. These glades are best developed in the area of the Central Basin (or Nashville Basin) in Tennessee, where they are geographically widespread and harbor high levels of endemism. Outside of the Central Basin, calcareous glades are found in lower numbers throughout the Interior Low Plateau, and species endemism is greatly reduced. Glades in the Interior Low Plateaus are characterized by species such as one-flower gladecress (Leavenworthia uniflora), limestone skullcap (Scutellaria parvula), widow's-cross stonecrop (Sedum pulchellum), poverty dropseed (Sporobolus vaginiflorus) and glade violet (Viola egglestonii). =Central Basin cedar glades= The limestone glades of the Central Basin in Tennessee are often called \\"cedar glades\\". The name comes from the abundance of eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana) that occurs on the margins of the glades or in cracks in the bedrock where the roots can gain a foothold. Many of the characteristic plants that grow in the limestone glades of the Central Basin are endemics that occur nowhere else, or disjunct populations of plants that are widespread in the prairies of the central U.S.Cedar Glades Brochure Center For Cedar Glade Studies Some species with highly restricted ranges that occur in the glades of the Central Basin include the Tennessee coneflower (Echinacea tennesseensis), Pyne's ground plum (Astragalus bibullatus), leafy prairie clover (Dalea foliosa), Tennessee milkvetch (Astragalus tennesseensis), Nashville breadroot (Pediomelum subacaule), and limestone fameflower (Phemeranthus calcaricus). \\"Cedar glade\\" in the Nashville Basin, Wilson County, Tennessee These glades can be saturated with water in the winter and spring, leading to \\"xerohydric\\" (dry/wet alternating) conditions.Glades Austin Peay State University Herbarium =Threats to the cedar glades= The central basin (or Nashville Basin) of Tennessee is one of the largest areas containing limestone glades. Because of the rapid growth of metropolitan Nashville and the surrounding cities of Murfreesboro and Lebanon, many of the limestone glades have been destroyed by development. The State of Tennessee and the Nature Conservancy have established a number of parks and preserves to protect important plant populations. Cedars of Lebanon State Park in Wilson County and Long Hunter State Park in Davidson County both protect substantial limestone glade ecosystems. Ozark Mountains glades Calcareous glades are well developed in the Ozark Mountains. In Missouri, the majority of these glades are found on dolomitic limestones, with less than 1% formed from carbonate limestone. Species indicative of Ozarkian calcareous glade communities include Cheilanthes feei, Echinacea simulata, Heliotropium tenellum, Isoetes butleri, Oenothera macrocarpa, and Ophioglossum engelmannii. In Missouri, Physaria filiformis is a species restricted to calcitic limestone glades. Ridge and Valley glades The Ridge and Valley region, which extends north from Pennsylvania south to Alabama, has significant calcareous glade communities. These glades often have dolomitic soils, resulting in a high magnesium content (in contrast to the glades of the Nashville Basin). In Virginia, these glades provide habitat for rare magnesiophiles such as Addison's leatherflower (Clematis addisonii), tall larkspur (Delphinium exaltatum), smooth coneflower (Echinacea laevigata), and glade wild quinine (Parthenium auriculatum).Limestone / Dolomite Woodlands and Barrens The Natural Communities of Virginia Classification of Ecological Groups and Community Types At the southern end of the Ridge and Valley in Alabama in Bibb County, species endemism of glade communities peaks. This area, known as a Ketona Dolomite Outcrops, was first recognized as ecologically significant in 1992. Since its discovery, eight new plant taxa to science have been described from this region, in addition to the 60 species of conservation concern found in or around this community.

This so-called ' was renamed ' (\\"north zone\\") in November 1942, when the previously unoccupied zone in the south known as ' (\\"free zone\\") was also occupied and renamed ' (\\"south zone\\"). Its role in France was partly governed by the conditions set by the Second Armistice at after the success of the leading to the Fall of France; at the time both French and Germans thought the occupation would be temporary and last only until Britain came to terms, which was believed to be imminent. For instance, France agreed that its soldiers would remain prisoners of war until the cessation of all hostilities. Replacing the French Third Republic that had dissolved during France's defeat was the \\"French State\\" ('), with its sovereignty and authority limited to the free zone. As Paris was located in the occupied zone, its government was seated in the spa town of Vichy in , and therefore it was more commonly known as Vichy France. While the Vichy government was nominally in charge of all of France, the military administration in the occupied zone was a ' Nazi dictatorship. Nazi rule was extended to the free zone when it was invaded by Germany and Italy during ' on 11 November 1942 in response to Operation Torch, the Allied landings in French North Africa on 8 November 1942. The Vichy government remained in existence, even though its authority was now severely curtailed. The military administration in France ended with the Liberation of France after the Normandy and Provence landings. It formally existed from May 1940 to December 1944, though most of its territory had been liberated by the Allies by the end of summer 1944.  Occupation zones  German soldiers march by the Arc de Triomphe on the Avenue des Champs-Élysées in Paris (June 1940) Alsace- Lorraine, which had been annexed after the Franco-Prussian war in 1871 by the German Empire and returned to France after the First World War, was re-annexed by the Third Reich (thus subjecting their male population to German military conscription.) The departments of Nord and Pas-de-Calais were attached to the military administration in Belgium and Northern France, which was also responsible for civilian affairs in the wide zone interdite along the Atlantic coast. Another \\"forbidden zone\\" were areas in north-eastern France, corresponding to Lorraine and roughly about half each of Franche-Comté, Champagne and Picardie. War refugees were prohibited from returning to their homes, and it was intended for German settlers and annexation in the coming Nazi New Order (Neue Ordnung). The occupied zone (, , ) consisted of the rest of northern and western France, including the two forbidden zones. The southern part of France, except for the western half of Aquitaine along the Atlantic coast, became the zone libre (\\"free zone\\"), where the Vichy regime remained sovereign as an independent state, though under heavy German influence due to the restrictions of the Armistice (including a heavy tribute) and economical dependency on Germany. It constituted a land area of 246,618 square kilometres, approximately 45 percent of France, and included approximately 33 percent of the total French labor force. The demarcation line between the free zone and the occupied zone was a de facto border, necessitating special authorisation and a laissez-passer from the German authorities to cross. German control post on the Demarcation LineThe name ligne de démarcation did not figure in the terms of the armistice, but was coined as a translation of the German Demarkationslinie.These restrictions remained in place after Vichy was occupied and the zone renamed zone sud (\\"south zone\\"), and also placed under military administration in November 1942.

The Italian occupation zone was also occupied by Germany and added to the zone sud after Italy's surrender in September 1943, except for Corsica, which was liberated by the landings of Free French forces and local Italian troops that became co-belligerents of the Allies.  Administrative structure  After Germany and France agreed on an armistice following the defeats of May and June, Marshal Wilhelm Keitel and General Charles Huntzinger, representatives of the Third Reich and of the French government of Marshal Philippe Pétain respectively, signed it on 22 June 1940 at the Rethondes clearing in Compiègne Forest. As it was done at the same place and in the same railroad carriage where the armistice ending the First World War when Germany surrendered, it is known as the Second Compiègne armistice. France was roughly divided into an occupied northern zone and an unoccupied southern zone, according to the armistice convention \\"in order to protect the interests of the German Reich\\".La convention d'armistice, sur le site de l'Université de Perpignan, mjp.univ-perp.fr, accessed 29 November 2008. The French colonial empire remained under the authority of Marshall Pétain's Vichy regime. French sovereignty was to be exercised over the whole of French territory, including the occupied zone, Alsace and Moselle, but the third article of the armistice stipulated that French authorities in the occupied zone would have to obey the military administration and that Germany would exercise rights of an occupying power within it: > In the occupied region of France, the German Reich exercises all of the > rights of an occupying power. The French government undertakes to facilitate > in every way possible the implementation of these rights, and to provide the > assistance of the French administrative services to that end. The French > government will immediately direct all officials and administrators of the > occupied territory to comply with the regulations of, and to collaborate > fully with, the German military authorities. The military administration was responsible for civil affairs in occupied France. It was divided into Kommandanturen (singular Kommandantur), in decreasing hierarchical order Oberfeldkommandanturen, Feldkommandanturen, Kreiskommandanturen, and Ortskommandanturen. German naval affairs in France were coordinated through a central office known as the Höheres Kommando der Marinedienststellen in Groß-Paris (Supreme Command for Naval Services in the Greater Paris Area) who in turn answered to a senior commander for all of France known as the Admiral Frankreich. After Case Anton, the \\"Admiral Frankreich\\" naval command was broken apart into smaller offices which answered directly to the operational command of Navy Group West.  Collaboration  In order to suppress partisans and resistance fighters, the military administration cooperated closely with the Gestapo, the Sicherheitsdienst, the intelligence service of the SS, and the Sicherheitspolizei, its security police. It also had at its disposal the support of the French authorities and police forces, who had to cooperate per the conditions set in the armistice, to round up Jews, anti-fascists and other dissidents, and vanish them into Nacht und Nebel, \\"Night and Fog\\". It also had the help of collaborationists auxiliaries like the Milice, the Franc-Gardes and the Legionary Order Service. The two main collaborationist political parties were the French Popular Party (PPF) and the National Popular Rally (RNP), each with 20,000 to 30,000 members. The Milice participated with Lyon Gestapo head Klaus Barbie in seizing members of the resistance and minorities including Jews for shipment to detention centres, such as the Drancy deportation camp, en route to Auschwitz, and other German concentration camps, including Dachau and Buchenwald. Some Frenchmen also volunteered directly in German forces to fight for Germany and/or against Bolsheviks, such as the Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism. Volunteers from this and other outfits later constituted the cadre of the 33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Charlemagne (1st French). Stanley Hoffmann in 1974, and after him, other historians such as Robert Paxton and Jean-Pierre Azéma have used the term collaborationnistes to refer to fascists and Nazi sympathisers who, for ideological reasons, wished a reinforced collaboration with Hitler's Germany, in contrast to \\"collaborators\\", people who merely cooperated out of self-interest. Examples of these are PPF leader Jacques Doriot, writer Robert Brasillach or Marcel Déat. A principal motivation and ideological foundation among collaborationnistes was anti-communism.  Occupation forces  The Wehrmacht maintained a varying number of divisions in France. 100,000 Germans were in the whole of the German-zone in France in December 1941. When the bulk of the Wehrmacht was fighting on the eastern front, German units were rotated to France to rest and refit. The number of troops increased when the threat of Allied invasion began looming large, with the Dieppe raid marking its real beginning. The actions of Canadian and British Commandos against German troops brought Hitler to condemn them as irregular warfare. In his Commando Order he denied them lawful combatant status, and ordered them to be handed over to the SS security service when captured and liable to be summarily executed. As the war went on, garrisoning the Atlantic Wall and suppressing the resistance became heavier and heavier duties. Some notable units and formations stationed in France during the occupation: *1940: Luftflotte 2, Luftflotte 3 operated from airfields in northern France during the Battle of Britain. Luftflotte 3 stayed there to defend against the allied strategic bombings until it had to retreat in 1944. *1941: Battlecruisers and . The battleship Bismarck was sunk while trying to reach French Atlantic harbors after its commissioning. *1942: 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich, 4th SS Police Regiment *1943: At the height of the battle of the Atlantic, between 60 and over a 100 German U-boats were stationed in submarine pens in French Atlantic ports such as La Rochelle, Bordeaux, Saint-Nazaire, Brest, and Lorient. *1944: 157th Mountain (Reserve) Division, Panzer Lehr, XIXth Army, 716th Static Infantry Division, 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend.  Anti-partisan actions  A volunteer of the French Resistance interior force (FFI) at Châteaudun in 1944 The \\"Appeal of 18 June\\" by de Gaulle's Free France government in exile in London had little immediate effect, and few joined its French Forces of the Interior beyond those that had already gone into exile to join the Free French. After the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, the French communist party, hitherto under orders from the Comintern to remain passive against the German occupiers, began to mount actions against them. De Gaulle sent Jean Moulin back to France as his formal link to the irregulars throughout the occupied country to coordinate the eight major Résistance groups into one organisation. Moulin got their agreement to form the \\"National Council of the Resistance\\" (Conseil National de la Résistance). Moulin was eventually captured, and died under brutal torture by the Gestapo, possibly by Klaus Barbie himself. The resistance intensified after it became clear the tide of war had shifted after the Reich's defeat at Stalingrad in early 1943 and, by 1944, large remote areas were out of the German military's control and free zones for the maquisards, so-called after the maquis shrubland that provided ideal terrain for guerrilla warfare. The most important anti-partisan action was the Battle of Vercors. The most infamous one was the Oradour-sur-Glane massacre. Other notable atrocities committed were the Tulle massacre, the Le Paradis massacre, the Maillé massacre, and the Ascq massacre. Large maquis where significant military operations were conducted included the maquis du Vercors, the maquis du Limousin, the maquis des Glières, the maquis du Mont Mouchet, and the maquis de Saint-Marcel. Major round-up operations included the Round up of Marseille and the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup. Although the majority of the French population did not take part in active resistance, many resisted passively through acts such as listening to the banned BBC's Radio Londres, or giving collateral or material aid to Resistance members. Others assisted in the escape of downed US or British airmen who eventually found their way back to Britain, often through Spain. By the eve of the liberation, numerous factions of nationalists, anarchists, communists, socialists and others, counting between 100,000 and up to 400,000 combatants, were actively fighting the occupation forces. Supported by the Special Operations Executive and the Office of Strategic Services that air-dropped weapons and supplies, as well as infiltrating agents like Nancy Wake who provided tactical advice and specialist skills like radio operation and demolition, they systematically sabotaged railway lines, destroyed bridges, cut German supply lines, and provided general intelligence to the allied forces. German anti-partisan operations claimed around 13,000-16,000 French victims, including 4,000 to 5,000 innocent civilians.Peter Lieb: Konventioneller Krieg oder NS- Weltanschauungskrieg? Kriegführung und Partisanenbekämpfung in Frankreich 1943/44, München, Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, 2007, At the end of the war, some 580,000 French had died (40,000 of these by the western Allied forces during the bombardments of the first 48 hours of Operation Overlord). Military deaths were 92,000 in 1939–40. Some 58,000 were killed in action from 1940 to 1945 fighting in the Free French forces. Some 40,000 malgré-nous (\\"against our will\\"), citizens of re-annexed Alsace-Lorraine drafted into the Wehrmacht, became casualties. Civilian casualties amounted to around 150,000 (60,000 by aerial bombing, 60,000 in the resistance, and 30,000 murdered by German occupation forces). Prisoners of war and deportee totals were around 1.9 million. Of this, around 240,000 died in captivity. An estimated 40,000 were prisoners of war, 100,000 racial deportees, 60,000 political prisoners and 40,000 died as slave labourers.Dear and Foot 2005, p. 321.  Propaganda  Military propaganda for European countries under occupation was headquartered in Potsdam. There was one Propaganda battalion in each occupied country, headquartered in the main town or capital. This was further subdivided at the regional level. Headquarters for France was at the Hotel Majestic in Paris, with propaganda sections () in Bordeaux, Dijon, and other towns. A ' (\\"propaganda squadron\\") was a service charged by the German authorities with the propaganda and control of the French press and of publishing during the Occupation of France. Sections (, \\"squadron\\") in each important town. After their victory in June 1940, the occupation authorities first relied on the German embassy in Paris (Hôtel Beauharnais) to monitor publications, shows, and radio broadcasts. They then set up the (France Propaganda Department), which developed Nazi propaganda and censorship services called Propagandastaffel in the various regions of France. Each Propagandastaffel was led by a commander and employed some thirty people. There were (special directors) in charge of particular areas: censorship of shows and plays, publishing and press, cinematographic works, and public advertising and speeches. The directors, chosen for their skills in civil matters, wore military dress and were subject to military regulation.  Civilians  The census for 1 April 1941 show 25,071,255 inhabitants in the occupied zone (with 14.2m in the unoccupied zone). This does not include the 1,600,000 prisoners of war, nor the 60,000 French workers in Germany or the departments of Alsace-Lorraine. =Daily life= The life of the French during the German occupation was marked, from the beginning, by endemic shortages. They are explained by several factors: #One of the conditions of the armistice was to pay the costs of the 300,000-strong occupying German army, which amounted to 20 million Reichsmark per day. The artificial exchange rate of the German currency against the French franc was consequently established as 1 RM to 20 FF. This allowed German requisitions and purchases to be made into a form of organised plunder and resulted in endemic food shortages and malnutrition, particularly amongst children, the elderly, and the more vulnerable sections of French society such as the working urban class of the cities. #The disorganisation of transport, except for the railway system which relied on French domestic coal supplies. #The cutting off of international trade and the Allied blockade, restricting imports into the country. #The extreme shortage of petrol and diesel fuel. France had no indigenous oil production and all imports had stopped. #Labour shortages, particularly in the countryside, due to the large number of French prisoners of war held in Germany, and the Service du travail obligatoire. Rationing tickets for the French population (July 1944) Ersatz, or makeshift substitutes, took the place of many products that were in short supply; wood gas generators on trucks and automobiles burned charcoal or wood pellets as a substitute to gasoline, and wooden soles for shoes were used instead of leather. Soap was rare and made in some households from fats and caustic soda. Coffee was replaced by toasted barley mixed with chicory, and sugar with saccharin. The Germans seized about 80 percent of the French food production, which caused severe disruption to the household economy of the French people.E. M. Collingham, The Taste of War: World War Two and the Battle for Food (2011) French farm production fell in half because of lack of fuel, fertilizer and workers; even so the Germans seized half the meat, 20 percent of the produce, and 80 percent of the Champagne.Kenneth Mouré, \\"Food Rationing and the Black Market in France (1940-1944),\\" French History, June 2010, Vol. 24 Issue 2, pp. 272-273 Supply problems quickly affected French stores which lacked most items. Faced with these difficulties in everyday life, the government answered by rationing, and creating food charts and tickets which were to be exchanged for bread, meat, butter and cooking oil. The rationing system was stringent but badly managed, leading to malnourishment, black markets, and hostility to state management of the food supply. The official ration provided starvation level diets of 1,300 or fewer calories a day, supplemented by home gardens and, especially, black market purchases.Mouré, \\"Food Rationing and the Black Market in France (1940-1944)\\" pp 262-282, Hunger prevailed, especially affecting youth in urban areas. The queues lengthened in front of shops. In the absence of meat and other foods including potatoes, people ate unusual vegetables, such as Swedish turnip and Jerusalem artichoke. Food shortages were most acute in the large cities. In the more remote country villages, however, clandestine slaughtering, vegetable gardens and the availability of milk products permitted better survival. Some people benefited from the black market, where food was sold without tickets at very high prices. Farmers diverted especially meat to the black market, which meant that much less for the open market. Counterfeit food tickets were also in circulation. Direct buying from farmers in the countryside and barter against cigarettes were also frequent practices during this period. These activities were strictly forbidden, however, and thus carried out at the risk of confiscation and fines. During the day, numerous regulations, censorship and propaganda made the occupation increasingly unbearable. At night, inhabitants had to abide a curfew and it was forbidden to go out during the night without an Ausweis. They had to close their shutters or windows and turn off any light, to prevent Allied aircraft using city lights for navigation. The experience of the Occupation was a deeply psychologically disorienting one for the French as what was once familiar and safe suddenly become strange and threatening.Ousby, Ian Occupation The Ordeal of France, 1940-1944, New York: CooperSquare Press, 2000 pages 157-159. Many Parisians could not get over the shock experienced when they first saw the huge swastika flags draped over the Hôtel de Ville and flying on top of the Eiffel Tower.Ousby, Ian Occupation The Ordeal of France, 1940-1944, New York: CooperSquare Press, 2000 page 159. The British historian Ian Ousby wrote: > Even today, when people who are not French or did not live through the > Occupation look at photos of German soldiers marching down the Champs > Élysées or of Gothic-lettered German signposts outside the great landmarks > of Paris, they can still feel a slight shock of disbelief.

Ousby wrote that by the end of summer of 1940: \\"And so the alien presence, increasingly hated and feared in private, could seem so permanent that, in the public places where daily life went on, it was taken for granted\\".Ousby, Ian Occupation The Ordeal of France, 1940-1944, New York: CooperSquare Press, 2000 page 170. At the same time France was also marked by disappearances as buildings were renamed, books banned, art was stolen to be taken to Germany and as time went on, people started to vanish.Ousby, Ian Occupation The Ordeal of France, 1940-1944, New York: CooperSquare Press, 2000 pages 171, 18 & 187-189. With nearly inhabitants killed and tons of bombs dropped, France was, after Germany, the second most severely bomb-devastated country on the Western Front of World War II.Centre d'études d'histoire de la défense, Les bombardements alliés sur la France durant la Seconde Guerre Mondiale, Stratégies, bilans matériels et humains, Conference of 6 June 2007, Defense.gouv.fr retrieved 5 November 2009 Allied bombings were particularly intense before and during Operation Overlord in 1944. The Allies' Transportation Plan aiming at the systematic destruction of French railway marshalling yards and railway bridges, in 1944, also took a heavy toll on civilian lives. For example, the 26 May 1944 bombing hit railway targets in and around five cities in south-eastern France, causing over 2,500 civilian deaths.See French language Wikipedia article :fr:bombardement du 26 mai 1944 Crossing the ligne de démarcation between the north zone and the south zone also required an Ausweis, which was difficult to acquire. People could write only to their family members, and this was only permissible using a pre-filled card where the sender checked off the appropriate words (e.g. 'in good health', 'wounded', 'dead', 'prisoner'). The occupied zone was on German time, which was one hour ahead of the unoccupied zone. Other policies implemented in the occupied zone but not in the free zone were a curfew from 10 p.m to 5 a.m, a ban on American films, the suppression of displaying the French flag and singing the Marseillaise, and the banning of Vichy paramilitary organizations and the Veterans' Legion. Schoolchildren were made to sing \\"Maréchal, nous voilà !\\" (\\"Marshall, here we are!\\"). The portrait of Marshal Philippe Pétain adorned the walls of classrooms, thus creating a personality cult. Propaganda was present in education to train the young people with the ideas of the new Vichy regime. However, there was no resumption in ideology as in other occupied countries, for example in Poland, where the teaching elite was liquidated. Teachers were not imprisoned and the programs were not modified overall. In the private Catholic sector, many school directors hid Jewish children (thus saving their life) and provided education for them until the Liberation. = Nightlife in Paris = German soldiers talking with French women by the Moulin Rouge in June 1940, shortly after the German occupation of Paris One month after the occupation, the bi-monthly soldiers' magazine ' (The German Guide to Paris) was first published by the Paris Kommandantur, and became a success. Further guides, such as the Guide aryien, counted e.g. the Moulin Rouge among the must-see locations in Paris.Emotion in Motion: Tourism, Affect and Transformation, Dr David Picard, Professor Mike Robinson, Ashgate Publishing, 2012, Famous clubs such as the Folies-Belleville or Bobino were also among the sought-after venues. A wide array of German units were rotated to France to rest and refit; the Germans used the motto \\"Jeder einmal in Paris\\" (\\"everyone once in Paris\\") and provided to the city for their troops.Paris under the occupation, Gilles Perrault; Jean-Pierre Azéma London : Deutsch, 1989, . Various famous artists, such as Yves Montand or later Les Compagnons de la chanson, started their careers during the occupation. Edith Piaf lived above L'Étoile de Kléber, a famous bordello on the Rue Lauriston, which was near the Carlingue headquarters and was often frequented by German troops. The curfew in Paris was not upheld as strictly as in other cities. The Django Reinhardt song \\"Nuages\\", performed by Reinhardt and the Quintet of the Hot Club of France in the Salle Pleyel, gained notoriety among both French and German fans. Georg-Hans Reinhardt was even invited to play for the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht.Michael Dregni: Django – The Life and Music of a Gipsy Legend. p.344, Oxford University Press, 2006, The use and abuse of Paris in the visitations of German forces during the Second World War led to a backlash; the intensive prostitution during the occupation made way for the Loi de Marthe Richard in 1946, which closed the bordellos and reduced raunchy stage shows to mere dancing events. =Oppression= During the German occupation, a forced labour policy, called Service du Travail Obligatoire (\\"Obligatory work service, STO\\"), consisted of the requisition and transfer of hundreds of thousands of French workers to Germany against their will, for the German war effort. In addition to work camps for factories, agriculture, and railroads, forced labour was used for V-1 launch sites and other military facilities targeted by the Allies in Operation Crossbow. Beginning in 1942, many refused to be drafted to factories and farms in Germany by the STO, going underground to avoid imprisonment and subsequent deportation to Germany. For the most part, those \\"work dodgers\\" (réfractaires) became maquisards. There were German reprisals against civilians in occupied countries; in France, the Nazis built an execution chamber in the cellars of the former Ministry of Aviation building in Paris. Many Jews were victims of the Holocaust in France. Approximately 49 concentration camps were in use in France during the occupation, the largest of them at Drancy. In the occupied zone, as of 1942, Jews were required to wear the yellow badge and were only allowed to ride in the last carriage of the Paris Métro. 13,152 Jews residing in the Paris region were victims of a mass arrest by pro-Nazi French authorities on 16 and 17 July 1942, known as the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup, and were transported to Auschwitz where they were killed.Online Encyclopedia of Mass Violence: Case Study: The Vélodrome d'Hiver Round-up: July 16 and 17, 1942 Overall, according to a detailed count drawn under Serge Klarsfeld, slightly below 77,500 of the Jews residing in France died during the war, overwhelmingly after being deported to death camps.Summary from data compiled by the Association des Fils et Filles des déportés juifs de France, 1985.Azéma, Jean-Pierre and Bédarida, François (dir.), La France des années noires, 2 vol., Paris, Seuil, 1993 [rééd. Seuil, 2000 (Points Histoire)] Out of a Jewish population in France in 1940 of 350,000, this means that somewhat less than a quarter died. While horrific, the mortality rate was lower than in other occupied countries (e.g. 75 percent in the Netherlands) and, because the majority of the Jews were recent immigrants to France (mostly exiles from Germany), more Jews lived in France at the end of the occupation than did approximately 10 years earlier when Hitler formally came to power.François Delpech, Historiens et Géographes, no 273, mai–juin 1979, File:Juif.JPGThe yellow Star of David made mandatory by the Vichy regime in France File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S59096, Plakat im Fenster eines französischen Restaurants.jpg\\"Jews not admitted here\\".

Most of France was liberated by September 1944. Some of the heavily fortified French Atlantic coast submarine bases remained stay-behind \\"fortresses\\" until the German capitulation in May 1945. The Free French exile government declared the establishment of a provisional French Republic, ensuring continuity with the defunct Third Republic. It set about raising new troops to participate in the advance to the Rhine and the invasion of Germany, using the French Forces of the Interior as military cadres and manpower pools of experienced fighters to allow a very large and rapid expansion of the French Liberation Army (Armée française de la Libération). Thanks to Lend-Lease, it was well equipped and well supplied despite the economic disruption brought by the occupation, and it grew from 500,000 men in the summer of 1944 to more than 1.3 million by V-E day, making it the fourth largest Allied army in Europe. A plaque commemorating the Oath of Kufra near the cathedral of Strasbourg, the capital of Alsace and Elsaß-Lothringen, and after the war, a capital of Europe as a symbol of peace and reconciliation The French 2nd Armored Division, tip of the spear of the Free French forces that had participated in the Normandy Campaign and had liberated Paris on 25 August 1944, went on to liberate Strasbourg on 22 November 1944, thus fulfilling the Oath of Kufra made by General Leclerc almost four years earlier. The unit under his command, barely above company- size when it had captured the Italian fort, had grown into a full-strength armoured division. The spearhead of the Free French First Army, that had landed in Provence on 15 August 1944, was the I Corps. Its leading unit, the French 1st Armored Division, was the first Western Allied unit to reach the Rhône (25 August 1944), the Rhine (19 November 1944) and the Danube (21 April 1945). On 22 April 1945, it captured the Sigmaringen enclave in Baden- Württemberg, where the last Vichy regime exiles, including Marshal Pétain, were hosted by the Germans in one of the ancestral castles of the Hohenzollern dynasty. Collaborators were put on trial in legal purges (épuration légale), and a number were executed for high treason, among them Pierre Laval, Vichy's prime minister in 1942–44. Marshal Pétain, \\"Chief of the French State\\" and Verdun hero, was also condemned to death (14 August 1945), but his sentence was commuted to life three days later.by de Gaulle, then leader of the Provisional Government of the French Republic Thousands of collaborators were summarily executed by local Resistance forces in so-called \\"savage purges\\" (épuration sauvage).

Remington and Sons (later Remington Arms Company). The action was extremely strong, and could easily withstand the increased pressure of the new smokeless powders coming into use by the late 1880s. It was made in a variety of calibers, both rimfire and centerfire, including the 12.17x42 mm rimfire, 12.17x44 mm rimfire and 12.17x44 mm rimmed centerfire Swedish and Norwegian cartridges, .43 Spanish (11.15x58mmR), .50-70, .40-70, .45-70 and later in .22 caliber. Later models were produced in .30-06 Springfield, 7×57mm Mauser, and 8×50mmR Lebel. Service rifle The Remington rolling block was developed from the 1863 pattern .50 calibre split breech carbine issued to the US Cavalry during the American Civil War. This earlier weapon was designed by Joseph Ryder and Leonard Geiger to fire the same cartridges as the Spencer carbine.Remington goes to war Unlike the rolling block, the split breech rifle lacked a hammer spur because it self-cocked when the breech-block was opened.NRA guns The later rolling block saw service with George Armstrong Custer's Seventh Cavalry at the Battle of Little Big Horn, and also in the hands of Native American braves during the Indian Wars.Weapons of Little BighornIndian weapons Remington Rolling-Block breech In 1867, the United Kingdoms of Sweden and Norway was the first military to adopt the rifle as the standard military rifle. Around 250,000 military rifles and carbines and 85,000 civilian rifles in Sweden, were produced under license by Carl Gustafs Stads Gevärsfaktori and Husqvarna Vapenfabriks Aktiebolag, and about 53,000 rifles in Norway by Kongsberg Vaapenfabrik. In 12.17×42mmRF and 12.18×44mmRF (two cartridges that were interchangeable), and towards the end of its service life also 8×58mmR Danish Krag centerfire, the rolling block served as the standard service rifle of the Swedish Army from 1867 to the mid-1890s, when it was replaced by the Swedish Mauser. In Norway it was the standard service rifle from 1867 to the mid-1880s, when it was replaced by the M1884 Jarmann. In .43 Spanish it was the chief service arm of the Spanish Army from 1869–1893, and was used by reserve and militia forces for many years thereafter. Many Rolling Block rifles were used by Argentina before being replaced in 1891 by the new 7.65mm Mauser, and were also widely used by Egypt and Mexico. Like Sweden and Norway, Denmark adopted the rifle in 1867 in 11×41,5mmRF (11 mm caliber). Initially the Royal Danish Army bought 40,000 rifles and 1800 carbines in the United States between 1867–1868. Later 31,551 rifles and about 4,600 carbines were made at the government owned rifle factory in Copenhagen. Production was halted in 1888 and the last rifles were decommissioned in 1940. In Danish service it was replaced by the M/1889 Krag-Jørgensen.  Use by the British and French  The British Empire purchased rolling blocks to arm the Egyptian army during the 1870s. These were made in Liege, Belgium in .43 Egyptian calibre and were issued with a sword bayonet. Rolling block rifles were used against Muhammad Ahmad's Ansar Dervishes during the Mahdist War, including at the Battle of Khartoum where General Gordon met his end.Egyptian Remington Guns with decorative brass Islamic crescents and Arabic inscriptions on the buttstock are not uncommon on the collector's market.Collectors weeklyOld Ammo The French acquired 210,000 Egyptian Rolling Block rifles to make up for a shortage of the standard-issue Chassepot and Tabatiere rifles during the Franco-Prussian War. During World War I, the British Royal Navy purchased 4,500 Rolling Block rifles in 7mm Mauser from Remington's leftover stock after production had ended, issuing them to the crews of minesweepers and Q-ships. In November 1914, production of the Rolling Block was resumed, in the form of a French contract for rifles in 8×50mmR Lebel, designated by France as \\"Fusil Remington modèle 1914\\". 100,291 such rifles were delivered by 1916, and used to equip rear-line troops. Civilian use Along with the Sharps rifle it was one of two rifles probably used more than any other by the buffalo hunters who hunted the American bison herds in the 1870s and 1880s. Civilian Remington rolling block rifles, and later surplus military rifles, became very popular among hunters in Scandinavia, particularly for moose hunting, with ammunition for the rifles being commonly available on the civilian market into the 1920s-1930s.

It was originally described by Ernest Arthur Freeman and Joseph Harold Sheldon in 1938.James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology. (10th ed.). Saunders. . As of 2007, only about 100 cases had been reported in medical literature. Signs and symptoms The symptoms of Freeman–Sheldon syndrome include drooping of the upper eyelids, strabismus, low-set ears, a long philtrum, gradual hearing loss, scoliosis and walking difficulties. Gastroesophageal reflux has been noted during infancy, but usually improves with age. The tongue may be small, and the limited movement of the soft palate may cause nasal speech. Often there is an H- or Y-shaped dimpling of the skin over the chin. Cause FSS is caused by genetic changes. Krakowiak et al. (1998) mapped the distal arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (DA2B; MIM #601680) gene, a syndrome very similar in phenotypic expression to classic FSS, to 11p15.5-pter. Other mutations have been found as well. In FSS, inheritance may be either autosomal dominant, most often demonstrated. or autosomal recessive (MIM 277720). Alves and Azevedo (1977) note most reported cases of DA2A have been identified as new allelic variation. Toydemir et al. (2006) showed that mutations in embryonic myosin heavy chain 3 (MYH3; MIM *160270), at 17p-13.1-pter, caused classic FSS phenotype, in their screening of 28 (21 sporadic and 7 familial) probands with distal arthrogryposis type 2A. b .0001 c .0002 d .0004 e .0006, .0003 In 20 patients (12 and 8 probands, respectively), missense mutations (R672H; MIM *160270.0001 and R672C; MIM *160270.0002) caused substitution of arg672, an embryonic myosin residue retained post-embryonically. Of the remaining 6 patients in whom they found mutations, 3 had missense private de novo (E498G; MIM *160270.0006 and Y583S) or familial mutations (V825D; MIM *160270.0004); 3 other patients with sporadic expression had de novo mutations (T178I; MIM *160270.0003), which was also found in DA2B; 2 patients had no recognized mutations. Diagnosis Freeman–Sheldon syndrome is a type of distal arthrogryposis, related to distal arthrogryposis type 1 (DA1). In 1996, more strict criteria for the diagnosis of Freeman–Sheldon syndrome were drawn up, assigning Freeman–Sheldon syndrome as distal arthrogryposis type 2A (DA2A). On the whole, DA1 is the least severe; DA2B is more severe with additional features that respond less favourably to therapy. DA2A (Freeman–Sheldon syndrome) is the most severe of the three, with more abnormalities and greater resistance to therapy. Freeman–Sheldon syndrome has been described as a type of congenital myopathy. In March 2006, Stevenson et al. published strict diagnostic criteria for distal arthrogryposis type 2A (DA2A) or Freeman–Sheldon syndrome. These included two or more features of distal arthrogryposis: microstomia, whistling-face, nasolabial creases, and 'H-shaped' chin dimple. Management =Surgical and anesthetic considerations= Patients must have early consultation with craniofacial and orthopaedic surgeons, when craniofacial, clubfoot, or hand correction is indicated to improve function or aesthetics. Operative measures should be pursued cautiously, with avoidance of radical measures and careful consideration of the abnormal muscle physiology in Freeman–Sheldon syndrome. Unfortunately, many surgical procedures have suboptimal outcomes, secondary to the myopathy of the syndrome. When operative measures are to be undertaken, they should be planned for as early in life as is feasible, in consideration of the tendency for fragile health. Early interventions hold the possibility to minimise developmental delays and negate the necessity of relearning basic functions. Due to the abnormal muscle physiology in Freeman–Sheldon syndrome, therapeutic measures may have unfavourable outcomes. Difficult endotracheal intubations and vein access complicate operative decisions in many DA2A patients, and malignant hyperthermia (MH) may affect individuals with FSS, as well. Cruickshanks et al. (1999) reports uneventful use of non-MH-triggering agents. Reports have been published about spina bifida occulta in anaesthesia management and cervical kyphoscoliosis in intubations. =Medical emphasis= General health maintenance should be the therapeutic emphasis in Freeman–Sheldon syndrome. The focus is on limiting exposure to infectious diseases because the musculoskeletal abnormalities make recovery from routine infections much more difficult in FSS. Pneumonitis and bronchitis often follow seemingly mild upper respiratory tract infections. Though respiratory challenges and complications faced by a patient with FSS can be numerous, the syndrome’s primary involvement is limited to the musculoskeletal systems, and satisfactory quality and length of life can be expected with proper care. Prognosis There are little data on prognosis. Rarely, some patients have died in infancy from respiratory failure; otherwise, life expectancy is considered to be normal. Epidemiology By 1990, 65 patients had been reported in the literature, with no sex or ethnic preference notable. Some individuals present with minimal malformation; rarely patients have died during infancy as a result of severe central nervous system involvement or respiratory complications. Several syndromes are related to the Freeman–Sheldon syndrome spectrum, but more information is required before undertaking such nosological delineation. Research directions One research priority is to determine the role and nature of malignant hyperthermia in FSS. Such knowledge would benefit possible surgical candidates and the anaesthesiology and surgical teams who would care for them. MH may also be triggered by stress in patients with muscular dystrophies. Much more research is warranted to evaluate this apparent relationship of idiopathic hyperpyrexia, MH, and stress. Further research is wanted to determine epidemiology of psychopathology in FSS and refine therapy protocols. Eponym It is named for British orthopaedic surgeon Ernest Arthur Freeman (1900–1975) and British physician Joseph Harold Sheldon (1893–1972), who first described it in 1938.

She enlisted at the age of 14, and served in seven different regiments until the conclusion of the war, thus holding the record for reenlisting in the most regiments. Compton fought at Mill Springs, Fort Donelson, Shiloh, and Gettysburg until the conclusion of the Civil War before moving to Ontario, Canada. Early life Little is definitively known of Lizzie Compton's early life, as she gave different details of her life each time she was discovered. When wounded and discovered on the battlefield at Green River Bridge, she claimed that she traveled from her hometown of London, Ontario to enlist in the Union. On another occasion, she had also claimed that her hometown was in Pennsylvania. The most complete account of her early life starts in a rural area near Nashville, Tennessee in 1848, where she was born. After the death of her parents in her infancy, Compton was left in the care of people whom she described as \\"unfeeling wretches.\\" In another case, she said that her guardians were secessionists, and were the reason of her escape. At an early age, she worked in the fields. During that time, she had not received an education, had never been in full women's clothing, and was never taught the duties associated with running the household, unusual for a girl in the mid 19th century. To escape her life, she left at the age of thirteen, dressed as a boy, when she got a job on a steamboat that established her identity as male.advantage  Civil War  Lizzie Compton was thirteen years old when the Civil War began. At the age of fourteen, she enlisted in the army, falsifying her age and changing her name. Two of her known male aliases were \\"Jack\\" and \\"Johnny\\". Compton saw considerable action during the war, serving in seven different regiments, holding the record for the most reenlistments. She transferred many times, either due to her sex being revealed or her fear of being detected. Her first reveal was when she was dared by her comrades to ride an unruly horse. While being treated for injuries sustained during the dare, the doctor revealed her as a woman, and she was thus discharged. In the 18 months Compton was in the army, she served in the 11th Kentucky Cavalry, 125th Michigan Cavalry, 21st Minnesota Infantry, the 8th, 17th, and 28th Michigan Infantry and the 3rd New York Cavalry. Her first battle was the Battle of Mill Springs on January 19, 1862, where she watched the fall of General Felix Zollicoffer. Compton fought and was wounded by shrapnel at the Battle of Antietam during the Union's uphill charge. After being wounded at Fredericksburg and being transferred out, she immediately headed west to rejoin the army as part of the 25th Michigan Infantry. While fighting at the Battle of Gettysburg, she was wounded and discharged again. She was subsequently shot in the shoulder in a squabble outside of Green River, Kentucky, at the Battle of Tebbs Bend. While she was being treated by the surgeon, her sex was discovered. Undeterred, she returned to Green River after her recovery to join a regiment that was encamped there. She also fought in the Battle of Fort Donelson, the Battle of Shiloh, and the Battle of Antietam. Compton was also occasionally drawn out of her regiment to remove or tend to the wounded on the field, a job that she was commended for.  Later life  On February 20, 1864, Compton was arrested under charges of disorderliness in Rochester, New York for trying to enlist in another regiment. When told that it was against the law to dress as a man, she replied that she would never be a lady. She said that she could be a gentleman, but she would rather die than be a lady. When taken to the Chief Magistrate, she told him of her story and was let go. Her bail was entered on account of her good behavior and cooperation, after which she boarded a train and left town. She went off to join the 11th Kentucky Cavalry, her last service, and was almost immediately detected. Her last known whereabouts were Ontario, Canada, where she made her home. Physical Appearance Lizzie Compton stood little over 5 feet tall and was slight of build. She was of stout build, had light brown hair, and a fair complexion. One contemporary said that she appeared a \\"rosy boy of fifteen\\", and another vowed that she wasn't above seventeen. As with many women soldiers, she relished the freedom that menswear gave her, both physically and socially.

The mantle is employed as a lung, and therefore immersion of the animal in sea water is of secondary importance, and occurs for not more than an hour at each high tide. This is one of very few air-breathing marine snails with an operculum and a veliger larva. =Feeding habits= This snail is a detritus or deposit feeder. It extracts bacteria, diatoms and decomposing matter from the surface sand. It egests the sand and a slimy secretion that is a rich source of food for bacteria. Human use In the past this species was an important food for the Māori. From Dave Robson, Auckland, NZ. - The titiko, karahue, pupu, Amphibola Crenata or mud-flat snail was plentiful in traditional times but because it took a lot of effort to extract the \\"meat\\" it was not a \\"staple\\" food of Maori. In earlier times it was preferable to travel miles by waka to collect pipi rather than walk 200m to scoop up the titko and spending a lot of effort to recover the meat. The titiko couldn't be used as a relish (kinaki) as it is a sealed unit with a hard shell and a cap (even 2) attached to its body that closes up and is difficult to remove. The only way in traditional times to remove the meat was to either smash the whole shell or to smash the top end and suck-out the soft contents. 25 years ago I was with a group of archaeologists near my papakainga (village) Maramarahi near Thames, NZ where they were explaining to me what a shell midden was. They said this is what your people were eating hundreds of years ago. I noticed that there were only a handful of Titiko in the midden even though there were tonnes readily available nearby. In comparison, there were hundreds of pipi and cockle shells. Over the next 25 years I asked every archaeologists and read heaps of archaeological reports/assessments as to why there were few Titiko in the midden. Their views is that it was a seasonal harvest, pollution had affected their habitats, not tasty, at least some acknowledged the difficulty to recover the meat. In the late 1950s and early 1960s I recall waiting for the time of the spring tide (3am low tide) and either wander to the mud-flats to pick titiko or cycle to the coast to pick pipi's. We would sweep and gather the titiko up with a branch, put then in a flax kete, wash/shake them in the incoming tide and then into a pot at home, boiled, then out would come the safety pin and titiko on hot fried bread and butter - only a delightful memory. It was only recently that I knew the full answer. It was the availability of the standard safety pin which were being used for tying up babies nappies. We only had one safety pin but it was an ideal tool – it had the perfect bend to access the Titiko cap/s and it had a sustained sharp point to pierce the cap/s and to pull out the tasty morsel including its tasty and chewy head and tastier entrails from the apex. Unfortunately I haven't had a meal of Titiko since 1963 and over the last 25 years during my travels all over NZ I have not seen a mature Titiko. I usually ask the old people I meet in my travel about the Titiko and they tell me the same story – they are small ones (10mm) around but no mature sized ones (25mm) ideal for eating. Apparently the Titiko, karahue, pupu, amphibola crenata is not a threatened species but unfortunately the mature ones certainly are. References * Rosenberg, G. 1992. Encyclopedia of Seashells.

It is also the first transshipment port in India. The port lies on two islands in the Lake of Kochi: Willingdon Island and Vallarpadam, towards the Fort Kochi river mouth opening onto the Laccadive Sea. The International Container Transshipment Terminal (ICTT), part of the Cochin Port, is the largest container transshipment facility in India. The port is governed by the Cochin Port Trust (CoPT), a government of India establishment. It was established in 1928 and has completed 90 years of active service. The Kochi Port is one of a line of maritime-related facilities based in the port-city of Kochi. The others are the Cochin Shipyard, the largest shipbuilding as well as maintenance facility in India; the SPM (single point mooring) facility of the Kochi Refineries, an offshore crude carrier mooring facility; and the Kochi Marina.  History  The Cochin port was formed naturally due to the flooding of the Periyar River in 1341 AD, and, over time, has become a major flashpoint for trade. The port in its initial history attracted European merchants- predominantly Dutch and Portuguese- and was later expanded by the British with the establishment of Willingdon Island. The traditional port was near Mattancherry (which still continues as Mattancherry Wharf). Cochin Port Trust in 1948 The idea of establishing a modern port in Cochin was first posited by Lord Willingdon during his governorship of the Madras Province. The opening of the Suez Canal allowed several ships to pass near the west coast and he felt it was necessary to build a modern port in the southern part as well. He selected the newly joined Sir Robert Bristow, a leading British harbour engineer, to head the project, and Bristow became chief engineer of Kochi Kingdom's Port Department in 1920. From that point forward until the port's completion in 1939, he and his team were actively involved in making a greenfield port. With extensive research spanning over a decade toward securing a permanent manmade port that could withstand monsoon erosion, he was convinced that it would be both feasible and largely beneficial to develop Kochi through its port. He believed that Kochi could become the safest harbour in India if the ships could enter the inner channel. The challenge before engineers was a rock-like sandbar that stood across the opening of Kochi backwaters into the sea. Its density prevented the entry of all large ships (requiring more than eight or nine feet of water). It was thought that the removal of the sandbar was a technical impossibility, and the potential consequence on the environment was beyond estimation. Efforts that had been previously undertaken on this scale had led to ecological atrocities such as destruction of the Vypeen foreshore. However, Bristow, after a detailed study of wind and sea current conditions, concluded that such issues could easily be avoided. He addressed the immediate problem of Vypeen foreshore's erosion by building granite groynes that were nearly parallel with the shore and overlapped each other. The groynes enabled a system of automatic reclamation which naturally protected the shore from monsoon seas. Spurred on by this success, Bristow planned out a detailed proposal of reclaiming part of the backwaters at a cost of . An ad-hoc committee appointed by the Madras government examined and approved the plans submitted by Bristow. The construction of the dredger Lord Willingdon was completed in 1925 and arrived in Kochi in May 1926. It was estimated that the dredger was put to use for at least 20 hours a day for the next two years to create a new island to house the Cochin Port and other trade-related establishments. Around 3.2 km² of land was reclaimed in the dredging. Sir Bristow and his team had successfully completed the port when the steamship SS Padma, was given clearance for the newly constructed inner harbour of Kochi. Speaking to the BBC directly after the port's completion, Bristow proudly proclaimed: \\"I live on a large island made from the bottom of the sea. It is called Willingdon Island, after the present Viceroy of India. From the upper floor of my house, I look down on the finest harbour in the East.\\"\\"75 years ago, Cochin Port happened\\". Metro Plus Kochi. The Hindu. Retrieved 11 January 2006. The Willingdon Island was artificially created with the mud sledged out for the harbour construction. During World War II, the port was taken over by the Royal Navy to accommodate military cruisers and warships. The strategic importance of Cochin during the World Wars was one immediate reason for the construction of the harbour. It aided the British in resisting the Japanese threat, but it also proved crucial domestically in the shaping of Cochin as a modern urban space, reorganising local caste and labour relations. According to a recent study, \\"[t]the 20-year long project appropriated, modified, or undermined existing social institutions of labour recruitment, work processes, skills and local technologies. The large-scale appropriation and modification of local skills and labour recruitment and work process in this colonial project produced a space of disparity by reinforcing the pre-capitalist caste-based corecive labour relations.

In 1932, the Maritime Board of British India declared the Port of Cochin as a major port and was opened to all vessels up to 30 feet draught. It was returned to civil authorities on 19 May 1945. After the Independence, the port was taken over by the government of India, and in 1964, the administration of the port was vested to a Board of Trustees under the Major Port Trusts Act. The port is currently listed as one of the 12 major ports of India.  Organizational structure  Cochin Port Trust is an autonomous body under the government of India and is managed by Board of Trustees constituted by the government. The board is headed by the chairman who acts as the chief executive officer. The government may from time to time nominate the trustees in the Board representing various interests. The chairman is assisted by the deputy chairman who in turn is assisted by department heads and officials of the following port departments: * General Administration * Traffic * Finance * Marine * Civil Engineering * Mechanical Engineering * Medical  Navigational channel  The entrance to the Port of Cochin is through the Cochin Gut between the peninsular headland Vypeen and Fort Kochi. The port limits extend up to the entire backwaters and the connecting creeks and channels. The approach channel to the Cochin Gut is about 1000-metre long with a designed width of 200 meters and maintained dredged depth of 13.8 meters (now dredging for 16 meters for ICTT). From the gut, the channel divides into Mattancherry and Ernakulam channels, leading west and east of Willingdon Island respectively. Berthing facilities for ships have been provided in the form of wharves, berths, jetties and stream moorings alongside these channels.  Infrastructure facilities  A draft of 30 ft is maintained in the Ernakulam channel along with berthing facilities, which enables the port to bring in larger vessels. In the Mattancherry channel a draft of 30 ft is maintained. The port provides round-the-clock pilotage to ships subject to certain restrictions on the size and draft. There is an efficient network of railways, roads, waterways and airways, connecting the Cochin Port with the hinterland centers spread over the states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Facilities for supply of water and bunkering to vessels are available.  New initiatives  The CPT launched E-Thuramukham, a comprehensive enterprise resource planning implementation programme, becoming the first Indian port to do so. The project is based on SAP platform and will be customized by Tata Consultancy Services. Maritime Heritage Museum-The Cochin Port Trust has set up a Maritime Heritage Museum in Willingdon Island where a good collection of unique and rare navigational equipments and photographs connected with the saga of construction of Cochin Port during 1920-40 period are on display. The exhibits reveal the hardships faced by Sir Robert Bristow and his workforce, who developed the port amidst financial constraints and without technology support.

It is a photosensitive, white, crystalline solid. It is a useful reagent in the laboratory as a source of silver ions lacking an oxidizing anion. It has been used in some antismoking drugs. Synthesis and structure Silver acetate can be synthesized by the reaction of acetic acid and silver carbonate at 45–60 °C. After allowing cooling to room temperature, the solid product precipitates. :2 CH3CO2H + Ag2CO3 → 2 AgO2CCH3 \\\\+ H2O + CO2 It can also be precipitated from concentrated aqueous solutions of silver nitrate by treatment with a solution of sodium acetate. The structure of silver acetate consists of 8-membered Ag2O4C2 rings formed by a pair of acetate ligands bridging a pair of silver centres. Reactions Silver acetate finds use in certain transformations in organic synthesis. =Sulfenamide synthesis= Silver acetate is used to prepare sulfenamides from disulfides and secondary amines: : R2NH + AgOAc + (RS)2 → R2NSR + AgSR + HOAc =Hydrogenation= A solution of silver acetate in pyridine absorbs hydrogen, producing metallic silver: :2 CH3CO2Ag + H2 → 2 Ag + 2 CH3CO2H =Direct ortho-arylation= Silver acetate is a reagent for direct ortho- arylation (to install two adjacent substituents on an aromatic ring) of benzylamines and N-methylbenzylamines. The reaction is palladium-catalyzed and requires a slight excess of silver acetate. This reaction is shorter than previous ortho-arylation methods. =Oxidative dehalogenation= Silver acetate can be used to convert certain organohalogen compounds into alcohols. It may be used, in spite of its high cost, in instances where a mild and selective reagent is desired. =Woodward cis-hydroxylation= Silver acetate in combination with iodine forms the basis of the Woodward cis-hydroxylation. This reaction selectively converts an alkene into a cis-diol. Uses In the health field, silver acetate-containing products have been used in gum, spray, and lozenges to deter smokers from smoking. The silver in these products, when mixed with smoke, creates an unpleasant metallic taste in the smoker's mouth, thus deterring them from smoking. Lozenges containing 2.5 mg of silver acetate showed \\"modest efficacy\\" on 500 adult smokers tested over a three-month period. However, over a period of 12 months, prevention failed. In 1974, silver acetate was first introduced in Europe as an over-the-counter smoking- deterrent lozenge (Repaton) and then three years later as a chewing gum (Tabmint). Silver acetate is also a well known precursor used in printed electronics. Particularly, complexes of silver acetate have been reported to form particle free \\"reactive inks\\" that form traces that approach bulk silver conductivity (within one order of magnitude). Safety The LD50 of silver acetate in mice is 36.7 mg/kg. Low doses of silver acetate in mice produced hyper-excitability, ataxia, central nervous system depression, labored breathing, and even death. The U.S. FDA recommends that silver acetate intake be limited to 756 mg over a short period of time; excessive intake may cause argyria.

Older danchi are sometimes compared to Khrushchyovkas, similar housing development project in the Soviet Union from the same period. The Japan Housing Corporation (JHC), now known as the Urban Renaissance Agency (UR), was founded in 1955. During the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, the JHC built many in suburban areas to offset the increasing housing demand during the post-World War II economic boom. It introduced the Japanese salaryman to a life around the nuclear family in contrast with the multi-generation homes before the war.A Generation in Japan Faces a Lonely Death, Norimitsu Onichi, November 30, 2017, New York Times. The kitchen embodied the raised status of the Japanese housewife, as it was in the center of the apartment, not in a dark corner. The families equipped them with the \\"Three Sacred Treasures\\": a refrigerator, a washing machine and a black and white television set. The rent payment for a is much cheaper than that of a condominium or a mortgage, but for a public the prospective tenant must usually participate in a lottery to be assigned an open apartment. Some built in recent years are quite modern and spacious, but since there is a lottery for assignment the waiting list can often run years. On the other hand, there continue to be many open slots in older, distant . Originally, the monthly wage of the renter had to be at least 5.5 times the rent. Residents in UR danchi do not have to pay key money or contract renewal fees, making the residences cheaper than comparable housing even if the monthly rents are equivalent. Some are owned by large corporations, who charge low or no rent to employees as a benefit as well as to encourage them to live alongside their colleagues to foster a corporate \\"family\\" atmosphere. Issues with danchi =Aging population= School being demolished in Tama New Town, Tokyo due to declining enrolment Today, fewer and fewer Japanese live in the rapidly aging danchi, preferring detached houses or condominiums, known as . Due to the mass influx of young families into danchi in a short period of time from the 1950s through 1970s, age groups of danchi neighbourhoods are much more uniform compared to other neighbourhoods in Japan. Since the 2000s, it became a major social issue in Japan due to its rapidly aging population with a majority of the population being pensioners with their dependents living elsewhere. The rapidly aging population have caused nearby stores, public facilities and schools to close, further keeping young families from moving into danchi neighbourhoods. Many of the new residents after the 1990s are childless couples or elderly singles. Seniors living in danchi often face isolation and are susceptible to kodokushi, a phenomenon of dying alone and not being discovered. Men living alone are especially vulnerable. Some danchi have attracted young immigrants and foreign worker families from outside of Japan, gradually lowering the average age of the population, although the seniors still face isolation. =Aging buildings= Danchi buildings built in the 1960s (right), situated across a street from modern apartment blocks built in the 2000s (left) Many danchi were built in the 1950s through 1970s with building codes and seismic standards of that time. Buildings from those periods are considered outdated and often have various accessibility issues. While most danchi have gone through seismic retrofit to meet the current seismic standards, many danchi are being demolished and rebuilt since the 2000s to modernize and bring the buildings up to current codes, improve accessibility and to attract younger families. =Public perception= Although the name danchi evoked the image of modern housing at the time they were built in the 1960s, today the name is associated with poverty, ageing population and outdated post-war buildings offering minimum amenities to their occupants. Modern \\"danchi\\" built in recent years are no longer branded as a danchi due to the negative image of this name.

Biography He was probably born in Oudewater, and is mentioned by Karel van Mander (1604) as a reputable painter at the time in which he lived. Albert van Ouwater in Karel van Mander's Schilder-boeck, 1604, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature According to Karel van Mander he was possibly a contemporary of Jan van Eyck and had been the teacher of Geertgen tot Sint Jans, though he was quick to qualify this statement with the eye-witness account of an old man named Albert Simonsz who had been a pupil of Jan Mostaert and claimed neither he nor Mostaert had ever even heard of this Albert van Ouwater or Geertgen tot Sint Jans. Van Mander highly commends an altarpiece by Van Ouwater in the principal church in Haarlem, the Grotekerk or Sint-Bavokerk, representing St. Peter and St. Paul, in which the figures are carefully and correctly designed, and richly coloured. Van Mander posits Van Ouwater as the founder of the Haarlem school of painting, making him the first major Dutch (as opposed to Flemish) artist. According to Van Mander, landscape painting was a particular specialty of this Dutch school, although none of Van Ouwater's surviving works exhibit this tendency. Van Ouwater seems to have been a contemporary of Dirk Bouts in mid-15th-century Haarlem, and Geertgen tot Sint Jans may have been his pupil. Van Mander describes another picture by Van Ouwater of a more extensive composition, the Resurrection of Lazarus, which had been taken by the Spaniards back to Spain after the siege of Haarlem as war booty, but which he saw the copy of that had been greatly admired by Maarten van Heemskerck. This has been identified as the painting now in the Staatliche Museen in Berlin. This is the only widely accepted attribution to Van Ouwater, although many scholars also credit him with the small, fragmentary Head of a Donor in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Max J. Friedländer also gave him a Virgin and Child (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), but this painting has also been associated with the early works of Dirk Bouts (the Metropolitan Museum now considers it the work of a German painter influenced by the Haarlem school). Less convincingly, Albert Châtelet adds a pair of altar wings with St. John the Baptist and St. Michael (both in the Capilla Real, Granada) to Van Ouwater's œuvre. According to the RKD he was also known as Albertus Veteraquinas,Albert van Ouwater in the RKD and the art historian W.R. Valentiner identified him as identical to the painters Master of Bellaert and Master of the Tiburtine Sibyl.Meester van Bellaert in the RKD References T'leven van Albert van Ouwater, Schilder van Haerlem. in Het schilder-boeck (1604) by Karel van Mander External links *Gerard David: purity of vision in an age of transition, an exhibition catalog from The Metropolitan Museum of Art (fully available online as PDF), which contains material on Ouwater (see index) 1410s births 1475 deaths Early Netherlandish painters Artists from Haarlem People from Oudewater ","title":"Albert van Ouwater"},{"id":"5020843","text":"Honda Interceptor may refer to: *Honda VF and VFR, introduced in 1982 *Honda VF1000, made from 1984 to 1988 *Honda VFR800, first produced in 1998 *Honda VTR250, two models, one produced 1988–1990; the other produced 1997 onward Interceptor ","title":"Honda Interceptor"},{"id":"5020850","text":"The National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), (), is a department of the Government of Pakistan and a major research institute of Ministry of Science and Technology (Pakistan).

His division was considered as one of the finest in the Army of Northern Virginia. Field was one of a handful of American officers who advised the army of Egypt following the Civil War. Early life Field was born at the family plantation, \\"Airy Mount,\\" in Woodford County, Kentucky. His parents had immigrated from Virginia, and his father was a personal friend of Henry Clay. Through Clay's and Andrew Jackson's influence, President James K. Polk appointed Field as an \\"at large\\" cadet to the United States Military Academy. Field graduated 27th of 43 cadets in the Class of 1849 and accepted a commission as a brevet second lieutenant in the 2nd U.S. Dragoons. He was assigned to frontier duty for five years at various posts in New Mexico, Texas, and the Great Plains. In 1855, he was promoted to first lieutenant and assigned to the newly organized 2nd U.S. Cavalry, a regiment under Col. Albert Sidney Johnston that also included Robert E. Lee and numerous other future Civil War generals. In 1856, Field returned to West Point as Assistant Instructor of Cavalry Tactics. He was promoted to captain in January 1861. Civil War With the outbreak of the Civil War, Field resigned his commission on May 30, 1861, and left West Point for Richmond, where he offered his services to the Confederacy. His first assignment was to organize a school for cavalry instruction in Ashland, Virginia. In July, he became major of the 6th Virginia Cavalry, becoming its colonel in November. In March 1862, he was promoted to brigadier general of a brigade of Virginia infantry. He served in what became famed as A.P. Hill's \\"Light Division\\" of the Army of Northern Virginia during Stonewall Jackson's Valley Campaign in the spring of 1862. Field performed competently during the Peninsula Campaign, but was severely wounded in the leg at the Second Battle of Bull Run in August. At first, it was feared that the mangled leg would require amputation, but doctors managed to save it. However, it took nearly a year for Field to recuperate, although he never fully recovered. During his convalescence, John M. Brockenbrough and Henry Heth commanded Field's Brigade, which officially retained his name until the Chancellorsville Campaign. In May 1863, using crutches to move, Field was able to resume limited military duties, serving as Chief of the Bureau of Conscription in the War Department until July. He continued as a conscription and recruiting officer for nine more months. Finally cleared for field duty, Field rejoined the army in Tennessee in February 1864, serving on the board of generals appointed to court-martial Lafayette McLaws. Promoted to major general, he commanded the veteran division formerly led by John Bell Hood. In the confused fighting in the Wilderness, Field suffered two minor wounds, but stayed in action throughout the Overland Campaign, including the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House. When Lt. Gen. James Longstreet was wounded during a friendly-fire incident in the Wilderness, Field briefly assumed command of the First Corps, but he was later replaced by Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson, who had more seniority and combat experience. Field's division continued to perform well during the fighting at Battle of Cold Harbor and Siege of Petersburg. On the afternoon of August 16, 1864, at the Battle of Deep Bottom, 5,000 Union soldiers under Brig. Gen. Alfred H. Terry broke through the Confederate lines and briefly threatened to rout the defenders. The tide finally turned when Field orchestrated a hard-hitting counterattack that forced the Federals to retreat. In April 1865, he surrendered with his division at Appomattox Court House. Numbering nearly 5,000 men, it was one of the few units still in fighting condition. Postbellum career After the war, Field pursued business interests in Maryland and Georgia. He traveled abroad in 1875 and served Isma'il Pasha, the khedive of Egypt, as a colonel of engineers, helping train native officers and supervising several construction projects. He later served as Inspector General. Returning to the United States in 1877, he was nominated for the position of doorkeeper of the U.S. House of Representatives. His service under a foreign head of state technically resulted in the loss of U.S. citizenship, rendering him ineligible for the post. However, former fellow Confederate general Eppa Hunton argued that Field's service was under a private contract and that he had never sworn an oath of allegiance to the khedive. Field was elected to the post. Field was a member of the Maryland Club in Baltimore. He became a civil engineer from 1881 through 1888 and then served for a time as superintendent of Hot Springs Reservation (later renamed Hot Springs National Park). He died in Washington, D.C., and was buried in Baltimore, Maryland, in Loudon Park Cemetery.Civil War High Commands In the 20th century, the commonwealth of Kentucky erected a roadside marker on U.S. Route 62 near Versailles commemorating Woodford County's Civil War generals, including Field.

Materials and production methods range from mass-produced and commercial, to local and traditional.  Uses  Their primary function is to protect the dinner table from water marks, food stains or heat damage. They also serve as decoration, especially placemats made from lace or silk. In restaurants, they can be used to advertise menu items, specials, local businesses or games for children. If the mat is cotton, it can absorb water and other liquids. Higher-end placemats – made from vinyl or leather – are used by hotels and organizations for meetings as they provide a writing surface, and give an area on which to lean comfortably and to place objects on the table with minimal noise during meetings. Contemporary opinion on the usefulness of placemats is mixed. Cloth placemats are commonly considered to be unnecessary and require excessive upkeep - compared to the surface of a table (which can be easily cleaned), a stained placemat must be run through the washer and drier before it can be used again.

View of the village of Evanger and Evanger Church seen across the river Vosso from the Bergen Railway Line The administrative centre of the municipality was the village of Evanger where Evanger Church is located. Evanger Church served the central part of the municipality. Nesheim Church and Eksingedal Church served the northern part of Evanger and Bergsdalen Church served the southern part of the municipality. History The municipality was established on 1 January 1885 when the western district of the large municipality of Voss (population: 2,045) was separated from Voss to become the new municipality of Evanger. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the municipality of Evanger was dissolved. The Bergsdalen and Eksingedalen valleys (population: 251) were merged with parts of the municipalities of Bruvik and Modalen to create the new Vaksdal Municipality. The rest of Evanger, with 1,075 inhabitants, was merged into the neighboring Voss Municipality. =Municipal council= The municipal council of Evanger was made up of 17 representatives that were elected to four year terms.

J. Leslie and Stephenson, creators of Dorothy Benjamin Charles Stephenson or B. C. Stephenson (1839 - 22 January 1906) was an English dramatist, lyricist and librettist. After beginning a career in the civil service, he started to write for the theatre, using the pen name \\"Bolton Rowe\\". He was author or co-author of several long-running shows of the Victorian theatre. His biggest hit was the comic opera Dorothy, which set records for the length of its original run. His writing collaborators included Clement Scott and Brandon Thomas, and composers with whom he worked included Frederic Clay, Alfred Cellier and Arthur Sullivan with whom he wrote The Zoo, which continues to be revived today. Life and career =Early years= Stephenson, the son of Sir William Henry Stephenson, came from a family with a history of public service, both civil and military. His grandfather, also named Benjamin Charles Stephenson, was a major-general and later one of the Commissioners of Woods and Forests.\\"Obituary, Major-Gen. Sir B. C.

C. Stephenson\\", The Times, 24 January 1906, p. 5 While working as a civil servant, Stephenson began writing theatrical pieces. His grandfather, General B. C. Stephenson, had lived and died at a house in Bolton Row, Mayfair, and the young Stephenson adopted \\"Bolton Rowe\\" as his pen name. Stephenson's first works were collaborations with the composer Frederic Clay in three pieces played by amateurs, The Pirate's Isle, Out of Sight and The Bold Recruit (1868). The last of these was repeated at a benefit, produced by Thomas German Reed, at the Gallery of Illustration in 1870 as a companion piece to Clay and W.S. Gilbert's Ages Ago.The Era, 24 July 1870, p. 6 Stephenson's first professional success came at the same venue, two years later, with a short operetta, written with the composer Alfred Cellier, Charity Begins at Home.Adams, p. 273 The piece was in the company's repertory for most of 1872, and was played more than 200 times.The Morning Post, 16 November 1872, p. 1; and \\"Dramatic and Musical Chronology for 1872\\", The Era, 5 January 1873, supplement.

Boucicault and Marion Terry.The Times, 19 December 1882, p. 8 Writing under his real name for the first time, Stephenson had a great success in 1882–83 with his play Impulse, based on La Maison du mari by Xavier de Montépin, which opened in December 1882 and ran through most of the next year.The Times, 1 December 1882, p. 6; and 18 September 1883, p. 6 In 1886, he adapted Der Probepfeil by Oscar Blumenthal as A Woman of the World, which was staged at the Haymarket Theatre, starring Herbert Beerbohm Tree and Helen Barry.Le Follet: Journal du Grand Monde, 1 February 1886, p. 16. In 1886 Stephenson had his greatest success. He and Cellier wrote the comic opera Dorothy. The piece opened at the Gaiety Theatre on 25 September 1886, receiving lukewarm notices. Much of Cellier's score was reused material from an earlier failure, and neither the music nor the libretto attracted critical praise. The Times wrote, \\"Gentility reigns supreme, and with it unfortunately also a good deal of the refined feebleness and the ineptitude which are the defects of that quality.\\"The Times, 27 September 1886, p. 10 Stephenson and Cellier revised the work, and it transferred in December to the Prince of Wales Theatre with new stars, including Marie Tempest. Dorothy became a great success at the box office and transferred in 1888 to the Lyric Theatre, where it ran until 1889. Its initial run of a total of 931 performances was the longest of any piece of musical theatre up to that time.Gillan, Don.

Stephenson's later work in musical theatre was less successful. For the Carl Rosa Opera Company he rewrote the libretto for The Golden Web, an opera bouffe by the composer Arthur Goring Thomas, which was first heard in 1893. In spite of some positive critical attention, interest in the piece was short-lived.\\"The Golden Web\\", The Musical Times March 1893, p. 152; and \\"Facts, Rumours, and Remarks\\", The Musical Times, January 1893, pp. 18–20 The same year, two short operettas with music by Edward Jakobowski, The Improvisatore and A Venetian Singer, made little impact.The Musical Times, September 1893, p. 549 and \\"Things Theatrical\\", The Sporting Times, 11 November 1893, p. 3 The Ranch, a musical farce with music by Edward Solomon, failed to find a theatre to stage it.

In 1892 one British newspaper protested that a new play, advertised as the work of Stephenson and Augustus Harris, was in fact the work of less-known writers.\\"Things Theatrical\\", The Sporting Times, 5 March 1892, p. 3 In the same year, Stephenson produced one of his more enduring works, Faithful James, a one act comedy.

Important Radar-Visual UFO On August 5 and August 6, 1953 the US Military investigated a UFO incident in Rapid City, South Dakota. What has become known as the Ellsworth Case is one of the most significant radar-visual cases in the annals of UFO sightings. The event was witnessed by almost forty-five agitated citizens along with military Air Defense System personnel. The object was first sighted by Miss Killian at 8:00 P.M. on August 5. The description was of a red glowing light making long sweeping movements. Erratic Motion Observed The information was transmitted to the Bismarck, North Dakota, Air Defense Filter Center. Sometime later Sergeant Harry spotted the objects from the roof. He observed, paying close attention to the irregular movement, as it danced between telephone lines. Others on duty saw the moving light which would be visible in the night sky for approximately three hours. Sergeant Harry described his observance in the following manner: It would remain stationary--then hop up several degrees very quickly--almost simultaneously. Another witness commented, It would stop...move to the left and then swerve down in a sort of slanting motion, repeating these maneuvers several times. Immense Luminosity Seen By F-84 Pilots At midnight three additional objects appeared in the sky above Dakota. The employees of the Filter Center had a feeling like someone was watching them. Before they were seen in Bismarck, two F-84s had been vectored into the area over Blackhawk, South Dakota. The objects and the jets were monitored on radar. One pilot established visual contact for twenty to thirty seconds. His description could be heard over the intercom. It's brighter than the brightest star I've ever seen. When the pilot gave chase the light inexplicably disappeared. Lieutenant Needham, the second pilot spotted one of the objects at 15,000 feet. It was below him and to his right. The object moved spasmodically up and down. The colors changed from white to green. In pursuit Needham climbed to 26,000 feet. He changed course to 360 degrees. After maintaining steady on 360 degrees for a brief time, his radar lock-on- light on the A-4 gun-sight came on and remained on. The object was ahead of him. It increased speed and moved rapidly ahead and up. The chase was being carried on the radarscope at the control room. Radar indicated that the UFO was staying five to ten miles ahead of the Lieutenant and his F-84. Finally Lieutenant Needham gave up his pursuit and flew back to the Military base. The object continued on and was detected by the Filter Center in Bismarck. Varied Colors Emulate A Wave At 1:09 A.M. an Air Force Globemaster II flew over Bismarck. As the plane neared, the object closest to the plane appeared to emanate a signal by blinking red and green. This signaling was picked up by the other three objects. An observer reflected about this, It was as if a 'wave' passed from one to the other. A signaling effect influenced a then- classified Air Force report filed by Dr. Hynek. He concluded, The entire incident, in my opinion, has too much of an Alice in Wonderland flavor for comfort. In the late 1970s Hynek confirmed his conclusion, That's exactly how I felt at the time. The Air Force offered a number of possibilities as to the cause of the sightings. In the final synopsis the objects would continue on the records as \\"unknowns\\".

Walsh is located on Main (\\"God\\") Quad, directly south of Sorin Hall and is directly north of the Knights of Columbus Building. It was built in 1909 and the architect was William J. Brinkmann.William J. Brinkmann Among other buildings on the Main Quad of Notre Dame, Walsh Hall is on the National Register of Historic Places. With . Map of district included with [text version available at National Park Service]. The coat of arms is taken from the Walsh family.  History  The cornerstone was laid May 12, 1909 by Archbishop Alexander Christie of Portland in a ceremony where the president of the university John W. Cavanaugh gave a short sermon. Walsh Hall was constructed at an estimated cost of $100,000 It was constructed in yellow brick, as most of the buildings in its surroundings, but its architectural style was more elaborate and decorated than previous buildings on campus. It was be three stories in height with basement and attic, with an auditorium located in the basement. It was formally dedicated and blessed on October 31st, 1909 by Apostolic delegate monsignor Diomede Falconio. It was built as a male dorm and could accommodate 104 students, and named in honor of the former president Fr. Thomas E. Walsh. Rev Thomas E. Walsh C.S.C created Notre Dame's first football team in 1887 and was only 28 when he was chosen by Rev, Edward Sorin to be appointed the sixth president of Notre Dame. Walsh expanded the University's curriculum and raised its academic standards. In the 1960s the basement was home to the Knights of Columbus at Notre Dame, before the Knights of Columbus building was built. In 1967 the hall's rector Father Dan O'Neil, made Walsh into a \\"stay-hall,\\" where students could live all four years if they so chose. This eventually became the standard model at Notre Dame. Walsh Hall During World War II, Walsh hosted the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps. When women were first admitted into the university in 1972, Walsh as well as Badin Hall were converted to female halls. Walsh Hall's chapel was renovated in 2012-2013 and is dedicated to the Visitation. During the renovations, stained glass windows featuring the Visitation of Mary to Elizabeth were installed. In 2016 it was announced that the residents of Walsh Hall would live temporarily in Pangborn Hall for the 2016-2017 year while Walsh Hall underwent the most significant renovations any residence hall had until that time, taking a full year. The move was met with mixed responses, with some criticism. The renovation included new piping and plumbing, additional lounges with full kitchens, new elevators and restrooms, and important accessibility options. Walsh Hall front on Main Quad Honors and awards In 2011, Walsh was awarded with \\"Best Freshmen Orientation Program\\" and \\"Women's Hall of the Year.\\" 2012 saw Walsh claim the championship in Interhall Lacrosse and in the Dorm Energy Competition. In 2013, Walsh took trips to the Interhall Championships for both Flag Football and Lacrosse, won Brother-Sister Hall of the year, and broke a record at Washington Hall for highest attendance at a student event with the Mr. ND Pageant. In 2014-2015, the Wild Women were recognized for creating the Best New Event for \\"Pie Your President,\\" the Best Diversity Event for the \\"I AM WILD\\" Photo Campaign, and \\"Brother-Sister Dorm of the Year\\" with Dillon Hall (again). Walsh rounded out that year by winning the Interhall Lacrosse Championship and garnering the much coveted \\"Hall of the Year\\" award bestowed by the Hall President's Council. In the 2015-2016 and 2017-2018 academic years, they were again named \\"Women's Hall of the Year\\", earning the residents a dance under the dome of the main building for each title.

The band was formed in 1997 and have released eleven studio albums. History =The first ten years (1997–2007)=  1997–2004  Hardcore Superstar was formed in Gothenburg, Sweden in 1997 by Joakim Berggren and Martin Sandvik. Their previous band Link had been grunge-inspired but with their new band they wanted to pull more towards rock'n'roll. They kept the drummer from Link, Mika Vaino (with the moniker DynaMike), and as lead guitarist they recruited Thomas Silver who had previously been in the band Glamoury Foxx with Jocke and had recently quit the band Green Jesus Saviours. During an early gig, Silver introduced Jocke as \\"Gothenburg's very own Jocke Berg\\", a reference to the singer of the Swedish band kent and the moniker stuck. Through Silver's contacts with the Gothenburg record label Gain Records they got their song \\"Hello/Goodbye\\" included on a promo compilation titled Gain Experience, which led to a record deal with the label. In early 1998, they recorded their debut album, released in Sweden on 4 October. The first pressing of 1000 copies sold very fast, and so did the second pressing. \\"Hello/Goodbye\\" was put out as the single and music video.Official band biography, 2009 The band got to support Backyard Babies, Motörhead and Dio, and soon the British company Music For Nations offered the band a new worldwide record deal. By the end of 1998, drummer DynaMike decided to quit. Jocke phoned Magnus \\"Adde\\" Andreasson, who at that time was living in Los Angeles where he had been a student at Musicians Institute. Adde, who had formerly been the original drummer of Link and his own band Dorian Gray, accepted the offer and moved back to Gothenburg. During 1999 the band's second single \\"Someone Special\\" became a hit song in Sweden and ended up on the Top 20 of national radio music charts. Instead of re-releasing their debut album with Music for Nations, as the label wanted, the band insisted on recording a new version since they wanted Adde to play on the album and they had already written new songs such as \\"Liberation\\" and \\"Have You Been Around\\". Bad Sneakers and a Piña Colada became their international debut album, released in the spring of 2000. The music video for \\"Liberation\\" was nominated for a Swedish Grammy Award. The entire year was spent on tour in Sweden, Europe and Japan. The tour continued into 2001 when it also took them to Canada for a few shows. In the winter of 2001 they released the single \\"Staden Göteborg\\" together with fellow Gothenburg band LOK. The song is an anthem to their hometown, and in February 2001 the two bands performed a joint set in Gothenburg where all members played together. On Midsummer's Eve they repeated this concept when both bands were the joint support act for AC/DC at Ullevi Stadium in Gothenburg. A few days later, Hardcore Superstar were invited to support AC/DC a second time in Turin, where they replaced Megadeth. In September 2001, the band released their third album, Thank You (For Letting Us Be Ourselves). The album had a more laid back and polished feel than its action rock predecessors, and spawned two singles; \\"Shame\\" and \\"Mother's Love\\" / \\"Significant Other\\". In the spring of 2003, they recorded their next album and during their summer tour they released the single \\"Honey Tongue\\". The album No Regrets was released on 27 August, once again with a different style from the predecessor. A second single, \\"Still I'm Glad\\", followed. For this album the Japanese version featured a completely different cover. After touring Sweden and Europe in the autumn and winter they made their first short tour of the US in March 2004, funded by the Swedish Export's Council. The day before their show at CBGB in New York they attended a cocktail party at the Swedish Consulate, where members of the band got into a fist fight with a Swedish tabloid journalist. When the band returned from the US they decided to take a break, after several years of hard work.  2005–2007  In the spring of 2005 the band made their first signs of a comeback with a few concerts in Italy. They had returned to their former record label Gain and in the summer they released their new single \\"Wild Boys\\", which became the most sold heavy metal single in Sweden that summer. By the end of August they did their Swedish comeback gig in Gothenburg, and in October they once again supported Motörhead in Sweden. A second single, \\"We Don't Celebrate Sundays\\", was released and on 2 November they released the self-titled album Hardcore Superstar. This return had a rejuvenated and heavier sound. The album was granted top reviews in several major Swedish newspapers and was nominated for a Swedish Grammy. The songs My Good Reputation and Bag On Your Head were also picked as singles. A show at the Sticky Fingers club in Gothenburg on 25 March 2006 was filmed for a DVD. A festival show in Tokyo during the summer was also released on DVD With this triumphant return, the band branded their new style as 'street metal'. The summer of 2007 saw the release of the new single \\"Bastards\\" which sold gold in Sweden and went to number 4 on the Swedish singles chart. During their summer tour they played the biggest stage at Sweden Rock Festival, a show that would later be released on DVD. On 7 November they released the album Dreamin' in a Casket, recorded both at Adde's home studio and in the studio of fellow Gothenburg band In Flames. This album had an even heavier sound than its predecessor. Once again there were top reviews and another Swedish Grammy nomination. The album was also released with a bonus DVD, featuring the documentary \\"Inside the Casket\\" about the recordings. The title track and the songs \\"Silence for the Peacefully\\" and \\"Medicate Me\\" were picked as singles. The following tour was called \\"Mentally Damaged Tour\\" and started in Helsinki, Finland on 12 November and continued through Europe. =2008–2018= On 24 January 2008, it was announced on the band's official website that guitarist Thomas Silver would be leaving the band, since he had \\"lost his fire and inspiration\\". Vic Zino, from their current opening act Crazy Lixx, replaced him temporarily for the remainder of the planned tour and when Zino later offered to stay he became the new permanent member of the band. In March 2009 the world's biggest heavy metal label Nuclear Blast announced the signing of Hardcore Superstar. The seventh album by Hardcore Superstar, entitled Beg for It was released worldwide at the beginning of June 2009. It was once again recorded in the In Flames studio. The first single \\"Beg For It\\" was released on 15 April and the song \\"Into Debauchery\\" would later get a music video. The album gave the band their third Swedish Grammy nomination in a row. The Japanese edition featured a live version of \\"Silence for the Peacefully\\" as the bonus track, while the American version contained two demo songs, one being \\"Welcome to Your Own Death\\", and the other \\"When I Glow\\", a demo version of \\"Need No Company\\", again, from the album Dreamin' in a Casket. Shortly after the Beg For It tour of the UK in 2010, Hardcore Superstar announced that they were planning to release a new album, as the tour had proved to trigger their creative minds, and as a result, new material was being recorded. On 12 April 2010 they announced four potential song titles from their upcoming album, being \\"Last Call\\", \\"Sick as a Dog\\", \\"Won't Be Bullied\\" and \\"Sadistic Girls\\". On 19 May 2010, the band released the titles of four more potential songs from their upcoming album, being \\"Lowlife\\", \\"Beat On the Bully\\", \\"Party Ain't Over ´til I Say So\\" and \\"Here Comes That Sick Bitch Again\\". \\"Last Call\\", and presumably, judging by the chorus of the song, \\"Party Ain't Over 'til I Say So\\", were changed to \\"Last Call for Alcohol\\", \\"Won't Be Bullied\\", and again, presumably, \\"Beat on the Bully\\", were changed to \\"Bully\\", while \\"Sick as a Dog\\" and \\"Lowlife\\" were left off the release. On 9 August 2010, Split Your Lip was announced as the title of the album, as well as a tentative release date, set for January 2011. When the band performed a free show in their hometown Gothenburg on 11 August 2010, they premiered the songs \\"Here Comes That Sick Bitch\\", \\"Last Call for Alcohol\\" and \\"Sadistic Girls\\". The first single, a double A-side featuring both \\"Moonshine\\" and \\"Guestlist\\" was released with the November issue of Sweden Rock Magazine and was followed by the album release on 26 November, two months earlier than planned. The album had been thoroughly rehearsed and then recorded live in only five days at Studio Bohus south of Gothenburg. The album was followed by intense touring. On 30 August 2011 the band announced that they would be releasing a Best Of album, with a release date of 26 October. The album was to include songs from all releases, with a brand new song entitled \\"We Don't Need a Cure\\". The song premiered on Swedish radio station Bandit Rock on 31 August 2011. On 30 October 2012, it was announced by Gain and Vic Zino that the next album would be called C'mon Take on Me. The debut single from the album, \\"One More Minute\\", was released on 17 January 2013. The album was released on 27 February 2013. It was recored at Brew House Studio in central Gothenburg. Four music videos were made to the album, for the songs \\"One More Minute\\", \\"Above the Law\\", \\"Because of You\\" and \\"C'Mon Take On Me\\". October 2014 saw the release of a new single, Glue, and the band toured Germany as the opening act for Gotthard. On 24 January 2015 the band performed a full headline set to a sold-out crowd at the Whisky a Go Go in West Hollywood, California, after more than ten years since their latest American show. The night before they also played a six-song opening set for Steel Panther at the 2015 NAMM Jam in Anaheim, California. At the beginning of March 2015 a second single was released from the upcoming album, Touch the Sky, and during the spring tour they premiered several new songs live. The album, titled HCSS was released on 22 April. A large inspiration for the album came when a fan in England managed to dig out old demos from 1994 with the band's predecessor Link, and some of the songs were 20 years old. In 2016, the band embarked on a co-headlining UK and US tour with Michael Monroe. On 12 October 2017, the band released the single \\"Have Mercy On Me\\" for their next album, and it was followed by four more singles (\\"Bring the House Down\\", \\"Electric Rider\\", \\"Baboon\\" and \\"AD/HD\\") before the album, You Can't Kill My Rock 'N' Roll, was released on 21 September 2018. All four singles were granted a music video, as well as the title track. The album was nominated for yet another Swedish Grammy award.

From September 2010, due to BSF works the Lower School site will accommodate Years 7 to 8, with Years 9 to 13 remaining at the Upper School. Admissions It is situated in the north of Bethnal Green, just to the east of Cambridge Heath Road (A107) and half a mile south of the Regent's Canal and not far from the Cambridge Heath railway station. It is opposite the London Chest Hospital, just off the Old Ford Road (B118) and in the parish of St James-the-Less, Bethnal Green. It is one of six schools in the borough that has a sixth form. History Henry Raine had made a good sum of money from selling alcohol. However he was a devout Christian, and he knew that he should use his wealth for good. He decided to found a school where poor children could get a free education. He built it in Wapping, where he lived and named it \\"the Lower School\\". It opened in 1719. \\"The Lower School\\", was designed to provide an education for fifty boys and fifty girls between the ages of 8 and 18 years. They would learn \\"the three Rs\\", which were reading, writing and arithmetic. Girls however were also taught to sew and to cook, and boys were also made to shovel coal underground for the school's heating, and to scrub the floors. This was done in between periods. =Boarding school= In 1736 Henry built and set aside money for a boarding school which would take on forty girls from the Lower School. It was known as \\"Raine's Hospital\\" and later \\"Asylum\\"(this did not have the connotations it has today). It would have been quite pleasant, with clothes being provided along with frequent meals. The boys and the girls were separated at first and the boys would be beaten if caught talking to a girl. Because of this a fence was put up between the boarding and lower school. In 1820, a new boys' school was opened as there was a large increase in boys at the lower school which was only a boys' school, the girls had the boarding school but were soon to move to the Lower School. It was opened in Silver Street by the Duke of Clarence who was later King William IV. In 1883, the boarding school closed and a new boys' and girls' school opened in Cannon Street Road. Not all places were free anymore, it was 3d a week for the preparatory school and 6d for the senior school. Raine's Foundation School-Approach Road site-part to south. =Former site= In 1913, the school moved to Arbour Square in Stepney, the building still stands today and is part of Tower Hamlets College. It was state of the art with its gymnasium, science laboratories, a girls' cookery room and in World War I a rifle range was built on the open rooftop for boys who could prepare for the army which they would fight in against the Germans. The separation for boys and girls continued until 1964, even the hall was separated by a hinged folding wooden dividing wall. =Comprehensive= In 1977, Raine's merged with St Jude's Secondary School and became a comprehensive school. In 1985, the school moved to Old Bethnal Green Road (the lower school for years 7 and 8), and the old Parmiter's building in Approach Road. Both are in Bethnal Green and remain there until today. The Upper School site is being redeveloped from Summer 2010 as part of the Building Schools for the Future project. This will result in Year 9 being based in the Lower School building. Motto The motto was devised when the school opened. It was: :\\"Come in and do your duty to God and man\\". It has, however, been changed to: :\\"Come in and learn your duty to God and man\\". The words of verse 4 of the school song say \\"Enter in and learn your duty, duty both to God and man\\"http://www.oldraineians.com/old%20raineians%20association%20school%20song.php Ethos and events The general ethos of the school has a friendly feel to it. The social integration of the pupils is good, as is their relationship with the teachers. Events include talent shows held regularly in the school at the end of terms. These are occasions when the pupils can show off talents or skills to their fellow pupils. The most recent was at Summer 2009. Uniform When it first opened it had a boys' uniform: cap, long coat with buttons (the neck button always had to be done up), tights and high heel-like shoes. The girls had: a coat, skirt and a hat. =Current boys' uniform= * Black blazer with school badge; white shirt; school tie; * Plain V-necked black or navy pullover (cardigans and hooded tops are not permitted); * Black trousers (not denim or corduroy); plain black leather shoes (boots are not permitted); * Plain dark socks * A plain navy or black coat or anorak.

The list below gives times per week for Key Stage 3, not the number of times if taken for options. The subjects taught now are: *English x7 *Maths x7 *Science x10 (Year 7), x7 (Year 10 onwards) *D.T. (Design and Technology) x1 (Year 7, Year 9), x2 (Year 8) **Textiles **Graphic Skills **Resistant Materials **Art (becomes weekly in Year 9) **Computer graphics (Year 9 only) *French/Spanish x2 *Religious Studies x5 *Physical Education x8 *History x3 *Geography x2 *Information Technology x1 *Business Studies (Only available as an option) *Skills x1 (Year 7, Year 8) *Citizenship x1 (Year 10 onwards) *Preparation for Adult Life x1 (until Year 9) *Music x1 *Drama x1 (Year 7, Year 8, Year 9) Compulsory subjects for GCSEs: *Maths *English *Science *Religious Studies *ICT *Physical Education *Citizenship The subjects in italic do not have to be taken for GCSEs, but an allocated number of periods per week for these lessons must take place. Headteachers and Heads of Years (2019) *Headteacher: Mr. Woods *Deputy Headteacher : Mr. Justin Childs *Head of Year 7: Mrs. Omo-Bare *Head of Year 8: Mr. Blenman *Head of Year 9: Mr. Jenkins *Head of Year 10: Mr. Leighton *Head of Year 11: Ms. Ayling *Heads of Sixth Form/Year 13 Partnership with China The school has recently begun a relationship with a school in China. Chinese are currently visiting the school. Opportunities within the relationship will include foreign exchange trips from both England and China. Chinese lessons currently take place after school on Tuesdays and Thursdays. A new teacher has taken over the lessons. In 2007, some teachers and sixth form students went on a residential trip to China to visit its partner school, and it was an incredibly successful and enjoyable trip for all. Success story The school's athletic department is top in P.E. The football teams usually gets through to the borough finals along with the basketball and athletics teams. The Girl's Athletics team have won the borough athletics league for 7 years in a row. Also the Math Challenge with EPGY is run every year with students who excel in Mathematics. It is an annual course in which pupils must sit an entrance exam.  The future  In 2006, the school received £17 million which will be spent on refurbishing both lower and upper schools which are aging rapidly. At some point in 2008 it is proposed that lower and upper schools will temporarily be merged in order to allow building work to take place at the lower school site with the current building being demolished. Due to its age, the upper school buildings shall remain but the interiors will receive refurbishment. The old Headteacher, Gordon Clubb, moved from temporary Head to a permanent position in 2007–2013. As a result of poor administrative decisions, in regards to hiring of senior staff within the school, the quality of the school significantly dipped. This was evidenced by the school's 2017 Ofsted report which concluded the school 'Requires Improvement'.https://files.ofsted.gov.uk/v1/file/50099429 Ultimately, it seems as if the school will be shut down and absorbed by nearby Oaklands. Academic performance It gets GCSE and A level results slightly under the England average. GCSE results are generally high in Tower Hamlets LEA. Raine's gets the second highest A level results in the borough.

The hero plays Werner Von Wallenrod, a farm boy who must interact with various characters in a fantasy atmosphere, solve puzzles, and fight enemies. Eventually the protagonist uncovers that he is the orphaned son of the late Axel von Wallenrod, a \\"Dragon Knight.\\" Werner sets out to uncover his past and reclaim his heritage. Werner's ultimate goal is to earn the favor of enough of the current Dragon Knights so as to be voted into their order. He also has to deal with his rival, Haggen Von Diakkonov.

Technical issues and release information The PC version had relatively high memory requirements, which made the game difficult to run unless the user first edited the AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files and/or created a boot disk. The game was bundled with multimedia kits such as those released by Reveal. At the time, many personal computers were not equipped with CD-ROMs and sound cards out of the box, and users wanting these features may have chosen their kit based on the pack-in software. The Reveal 4x CD-ROM kit featured a SC400 sound card, speakers, and a large bundle of multimedia software, including games and educational titles. Besides Dragon Lore, this kit featured another Cryo Interactive game, MegaRace. GOG.com released an emulated version for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X in 2013. Reception Dragon Lore was a commercial success, with sales of 300,000 units by 1997. A reviewer for Next Generation applauded the game for its fast-moving rendered graphics, captivating plot, and gratifyingly difficult puzzles in its later sections. He added that the inclusion of fighting segments, in addition to being satisfying of themselves, serve to break up the monotony that puzzle adventure games sometimes suffer from. GamePros brief review of the 3DO version stated, \\"Smooth, rendered 3D animation and voice clips accompany the great mythological storyline to make up a well-rounded game. RPG fans will enjoy the attention to detail as well as the intuitive motions and menus ... slow access time is one of the few setbacks.\\" References External links * 1994 video games 3DO Interactive Multiplayer games Adventure games Cancelled Sega CD games Cryo Interactive games DOS games Fantasy video games Games commercially released with DOSBox Single-player video games Video games developed in France Video games with pre- rendered 3D graphics ","title":"Dragon Lore"},{"id":"5020943","text":"Center of Excellence in Molecular Biology (CEMB) is a highly distinguished biological research institute in Asia, located on the West Bank of the picturesque Canal Road Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. It is an autonomous organization that is under administrative control of University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan. History On 1 November 1981, University of the Punjab announced the \\"birth\\" of the Centre. In April, 1983 the Federal Government allocated a sum of 1.635 million rupees to create a nucleus laboratory of the Centre. In November, 1985 the proposal to establish the Centre for Advanced Molecular Biology (CAMB) was approved at a cost of 24.55 million rupees. In 1986, the CAMB project was upgraded into a Centre of Excellence in Molecular Biology (CEMB) and the cost of setting it up was subsequently revised in January 1991, to 44.33 million rupees. In April 1987, the Federal Ministry of Science & Technology (MOST) approved the establishment of a Centre for Applied Molecular Biology (CAMB), located back to back with the laboratory block of the Centre of Excellence in Molecular Biology (CEMB). The CEMB established nucleus laboratories in March, 1985 in two student laboratories of the Department of Zoology, University of the Punjab, Quaid-e-Azam Campus, Lahore. Construction work on the CEMB building started in 1987 on a site located in Lahore's southern suburb of Thokar Niaz Baig along the Canal. The scientific staff moved into the new building in late 1992-93. Admission process The Centre offers M.Phil and Ph.D. in Molecular Biology. Annually, only 20-30 position for academically brilliant students with research aptitude, from all over the world, are available for M.Phil and Ph.D. The admission process is one of the toughest and highly competitive in Pakistan with admission rate of around 10% annually. A greater number of foreign scholars are also pursuing their M.Phil and Ph.D in the centre. Research groups CEMB has the following research groups: #Applied and Functional Genomics #Bioinformatics #Congenital Mental Retardation #Crop Breeding and GMO Detection Group #Development of Recombinant Biopharmaceuticals #Forensic Research Lab #Forensic Services Lab #Hearing Impairment #Medical Genetics Group #Molecular Medicine #Molecular Virology and Molecular diagnostics #Plant Biosafety, #Plant Genomics, #Plant Transformation #Seed Biotechnology #Stem Cell Research #Vision Impairment Achievements CEMB researchers have made a great contribution to Molecular Biology. Recently, CEMB has made Bt transgenic rice, Bt transgenic cotton and virus-free gladiolus, potato and tomato. Several kits are made for the PCR-based diagnosis of HCV and HBV . A total of 11 new deafness loci, 3 vision impairment loci and 17 new genes are discovered here. All these results have been published in the form of research papers in more than 100 international journals of high reputation including Nature, American Journal of Human Genetics, European Journal of Human Genetics, Molecular Vision, Virology Journal, Infectious Diseases, PLoS, Differentiation, Forensic Science International and International Journal of Legal Medicine. Besides, CEMB holds the rights to 7 patents for inventions made by its scientists. In recognition of these achievements, Islamic Development Bank conferred it with Science and Technology Prize in 2008. International collaborations As research in general and molecular biology in particular is an expensive business to do, CEMB often has collaborations with many national and international research institutes. These include National Institute of Health (NIH) USA, University of Cincinnati, University of Washington, University of Arizona, Johns-Hopkins University, Brigham Young University and US Department of Agriculture. Local collaborations CEMB also has linkages with local institutes like Quaid-e-Azam University Islamabad, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, University of Lahore, Lahore College for Women University, Forman Christian University Lahore, Comsats Islamabad, Abdul Wali Khan University Mardan, Bahauddin Zakariya University Multan, Government College University Lahore, Government College University Faisalabad, Baluchistan University of Information Technology, Engineering and Management Sciences, Quetta, Sheikh Zayed Hospital Lahore, University of Health Sciences Lahore, Jinnah Hospital Lahore, King Edwards Medical University Lahore and Allama Iqbal Medical College Lahore.

Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot (1 player) Armored Warriors most prominent feature is its multi-player option, and the ability to augment the players' mechs with a large array of different parts for varied attacks. Multiple regions of the mech could be switched, including the arms, legs and handheld weaponry. Such parts were gained (or lost) by inflicting damage upon enemies, which would cause various parts to disembark and be wielded by the player. Additionally, by using commands, the players could use an option called a \\"Team-up Change\\" which initiated a powerful attack used in tandem, and could also further vary the customization of weapons by using a main and sub-weapon. Gameplay follows a mission-like structure, with seven in total. Each stage consists of the game giving the player prerequisites such as a time-limit to eliminate enemies, a set amount of ammunition for weapons, and destroying a varying number of enemies. Each stage ended with a boss character, and the game provided a competent replay value with the customization options.  Plot  In the year 2281, the United Earth Government and the Principalities of Raia signed a ceasefire treaty, ending a war that lasted for half a century. One year after the signing of the treaty, the United Earth Government's 18th scouting party reported that the Raian capital, Melkide, has been captured by an army of unknown origin. The United Earth Government decided to dispatch an army to Raia to retake the capital and rescue its citizens. However, unbeknownst to the general public, the true purpose of this operation was to eliminate the unknown enemy and bring Raia under Earth's control.  Characters  * 1st Lieutenant Jeff Perkins pilots the AEX-10M BLODIA, a well-designed machine that is equally matched in all areas of combat. Its firepower is below average but makes up slightly greater attack distance. * Captain Ray Turner pilots the SVA-6L REPTOS, a mecha designed for close ranged/melee combat. Its light and mobile specifications make it plausible for high-speed situations. * Major Glenn Reed uses the AEX-10H GULDIN, a power-type mech used for absorbing damage and plowing through opposition. Its high attack statistics give it a low speed designation, however. * 2nd Lt Sarah White uses the AEX-12J FORDY, an extremely fast mech used for rushing attacks and a featuring a high mobility. It lacks a sufficient amount of armor and must use its speed to avoid damage.

The administrative centre of the municipality was the village of Bruvik where Bruvik Church is located. History The parish of Haus was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). On 1 January 1870, the northeastern district of Haus (population: 2,062) was separated from Haus to form the new municipality of Bruvik. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the municipality of Bruvik was dissolved and its lands were split up as follows: *the area around the village of Bruvik on the island of Osterøy (population: 409) was merged with parts of the municipalities of Haus (population: 2,237), Hamre (population: 1,166), and Hosanger (population: 1,616) to create the new Osterøy Municipality. *the rest of Bruvik (population: 5,264), was merged with a parts of the municipalities of Evanger (population: 251) and Modalen (population: 151) to create the new Vaksdal Municipality. =Municipal council= The municipal council of Bruvik was made up of 37 representatives that were elected to four year terms.

He played for Deportivo Quito in the Ecuadorian Serie A and the Ecuadorian national team. Club career Elizaga started his career in 1992 for Nueva Chicago in the Argentine 2nd division. In 1998, he transferred to Club Atlético Lanús in the Primera Division Argentina. In 2000, he joined Quilmes Atlético Club in the 2nd division and helped them gain promotion to the Primera. Since transferring to Emelec he has received awards including Goalkeeper of the Year in 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008 and 2009 from the Ecuadorian Championship. Elizaga became a citizen of Ecuador after declaring his intention of playing in the international stage. He has also stated that he has a love for his new country. Emelec He arrived to Ecuador in 2004 as one of four foreign players signed by Emelec for that season. He immediately started showing great goalkeeping skills and despite or because Emelec's poor season he quickly became a fan favourite thanks to his performances for the club, and he won his first award of many for best goalkeeper of the year in Ecuador. He was ratified in the club for the next season and once again he became Emelec's best player helping the club avoid relegation for the second season in a row, and winning his second best goalkeeper of the year award in a row. Six years later he remains in the club despite many opportunities to leave and he is its captain and fan favourite. He has openly declared his intentions of retiring playing for Emelec, but not before winning a title with the club, he was very close in 2006 when Emelec finished second behind El Nacional and in 2009 when they finished third in the Ecuadorian tournament. In 2010, Elizaga helped Emelec to qualify to that year's final matches against LDU Quito, but controversially was sent to the bench in this two matches by the team's manager Jorge Luis Sampaoli. Emelec could not score more than two goals in the final match, so Liga won the championship (Emelec lost the away match 2–0, so had to win at least 2–0 to secure penalty definition, but only scored one goal). On 30 December 2010, Elizaga left Emelec and signed with Deportivo Quito for one season, a transfer that was met with lot of surprise specially by Emelec's fans. In December 2011, Elizaga won the national championship with his new club Deportivo Quito, winning the title against his past team Emelec, playing the two finals and keeping a clean sheet. International career He made his international debut in May 2007 with Ecuador against Ireland. They later tied 1–1. Selected for the 2007 Copa América, he demonstrated superb goalkeeping skill during Ecuador's final match against giants Brazil keeping the score level until Robinho's penalty. They were eliminated 1–0. Elizaga later got called up for the 3rd and 4th rounds of the FIFA World Cup Qualification in the CONMEBOL region against Paraguay and Peru. Elizaga kept the Peruvians off the scoreboard until he was substituted off. He did not receive a call up for a while but is being put back on the line-up and has demonstrated good showings including Ecuador's victory over Colombia at Giants Stadium, where he stopped a penalty kick as well as the rebound. He continually receives call-ups for the national team, often as a back-up for José Francisco Cevallos. In June 2009, he started in World Cup qualifiers against Peru and Argentina in place of the injured Cevallos. During those matches, he helped the squad earn crucial points for qualification, including a clean-sheet against Argentina in which he saved a penalty kick against Carlos Tevez during the first half of the match. He also performed strongly during a decisive match against Uruguay, but conceded a penalty kick (converted by Diego Forlan) after bringing down an Uruguyan striker in the last minutes of the game, resulting in a 1–2 loss. In 2011, he was called up once again to guard Ecuador's goal posts, this time during the Copa America played in Argentina.

Biography Begeyn was born in Leiden. Though perhaps known mostly for his Italianate landscapes and cattle in the manner of Nicolaes Pietersz Berchem, Begyn was a highly skilled painter active in many genres, who traveled widely. According to the RKD, Begeyn's earliest known work is from 1653, though he was first accepted into the Guild of St. Luke in Leiden in 1655. He stopped paying dues in 1667, because he set off for a trip to Italy. He is registered in Rome and Naples from 1659–1660. In the rampjaar or disaster year, of 1672, he is registered in Amsterdam, and after that he lived in London, where he painted at Ham House, Surrey, together with Willem van de Velde the Younger (1633–1707) and Dirck van der Bergen (1645–1690). In 1681 he was in the Hague where two years later he became a member of the painters' confraternity 'Pictura'. He moved to Berlin in 1688, where he became Prussian court painter.Abraham Jansz. Begeyn in the RKD There his works were greatly prized, and, according to Houbraken, he was principal painter to Frederick III, the elector of Brandenburg, afterwards king of Prussia. He died of a heart attack when Augustinus Terwesten came to visit his studio, accompanied by two other painters. Death of Abraham Begyn in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature It is highly possible that he felt put under great pressure by Terwesten to perform, since Terwesten had also become court painter in Berlin and had also started an academy there, which opened in 1697. The two men were in direct competition with each other for the title of professor. Begeyn died in Berlin. In many collections in the Netherlands, the pictures of Begeyn are placed amongst those of the most admired masters. His pencilling is light and free, and his colouring very agreeable. Many of his works are landscapes like Peasants with Cattle by a Ruin, with views of rivers, ruins, and pieces of architecture, enriched with figures and a variety of animals. He is also known for his still life paintings of flowers and hunting paraphernalia.

The 1KD-FTV is a straight- four common rail D-4D (Direct injection four-stroke common-rail Diesel) diesel engine with a variable nozzle turbocharger (VNT) and Intercooler. It has 16 valves and a double overhead camshaft (DOHC) design. Bore and stroke is . It generates at 3400 rpm, and of torque at 1800-3400 rpm depending on target market and emission specifications. In some markets, outputs are / and /. Redline of this engine is at 4200 rpm. Compression ratio is 17.9:1. This engine uses Toyota's D-4D Common Rail fuel injection technology operating at ultra high pressures of up to which is about 8 times more than the pressure of conventional fuel injection systems within a \\"common rail\\" that feeds the injectors on all four cylinders. This is combined with a 32-bit ECU which controls fuel quantity, valve timing, and boost pressure at different engine parameters resulting in best fuel economy and also full utilization of power during acceleration. Pilot injection is also utilized by the common rail fuel system to smooth engine operation. Small amounts of fuel are introduced into the combustion chamber prior to the main injection event, reducing lag time and promoting more continuous and complete combustion. Exterior and interior engine noise is also reduced. The 1KD engine produces 17% more power with 11% less fuel consumption than its predecessor, the 1KZ engine. This engine was first used in Toyota Land Cruiser Prado, third generation Hilux Surf and now used in the Toyota Fortuner, HiAce and Toyota Hilux. 2KD-FTV Appearing in November 2001, the 2KD-FTV is the 2nd generation of the KD series of engine with a smaller displacement and went on sale in the UK market in the 2002 Toyota Hiace producing either 88bhp at 3,800rpm and 192Nm at 1,200-3,000rpm or 102bhp@3600rpm and 260Nm of 1,600-2,400rpm The displacement of this engine is based on the previous 2L engine. Bore remains the same but stroke is increased to . It has 16 valves and is a DOHC engine with a turbocharger and intercooler. It produces at 3400 rpm and of torque at 1600-2400 rpm with 4 speed Automatic ECT transmission without intercooler and of torque at 1600-3600 rpm with manual transmission without intercooler and at 3400 rpm and of torque at 1600-3600 rpm for the intercooled version. Toyota Thailand, has updated the turbocharger to variable nozzle turbo (VNT) with intercooler. This increased the horsepower to at 3400 rpm and torque to at 1600-2800 rpm. Compression ratio is 18.5:1. Redline of this engine is 4400 RPM. This engine also uses D-4D Common Rail (Common rail direct fuel injection) technology. The manufacturers default injection timing is 6.5 deg before TDC. The only major changes from the 1KD-FTV to the 2KD-FTV was the bore and the stroke. In 2005, Denso Corporation was introduced the 3rd generation of Common Rail System (CRS) on the next 2KD-FTV engine (2005). This fuel system provides an ultra high injection pressure up to in order to promote the clean diesel engine. In this engine, the compression ratio was reduced to 17.4:1 with high pressurized and multiple diesel injection. The multiple injection consists of a pilot injection and a main injection, in order to shortening the ignition delay, reduce the noise and emission. The pilot injection timing is 5-6 deg before TDC (dependent to the correction factor by the ECU) while the main injection timing is on the TDC. However, the pilot injection is repealed as the engine speed reach to 2200 rpm and above at low load condition. This generation of 2KD-FTV engine produces at 3600 rpm and the maximum torque is at 2000 rpm. This engine is used in the Toyota Hilux, Toyota Fortuner, Toyota Innova and Toyota Hiace. In some Central and South American countries, Toyota also offered this engine on the 2003-2006 4Runner in limited quantities.

Initially, Valestrand had a population of 900. On 1 April 1870, the Øklandsgrend area (population: 247) of the neighboring municipality of Finnås was transferred to Valestrand. On 1 January 1964, a major municipal merger took place as a result of the Schei Committee. The municipalities of Sveio (population: 1,697) and Valestrand (population: 1,216) were merged with the western part of the municipality of Vikebygd (population: 471) and a small portion of the northern part of the municipality of Skjold (population: 24), both located north and west of the Ålfjorden.

In looking for a keeper for Ramses, they find a demoralized Englishman named Donald Fraser. Donald has troubled family relationships and a hashish habit, both of which Amelia means to reform. Enid Debenham, a young lady whose behavior scandalizes Cairo society, also takes a hand when Amelia takes her under her wing. Meanwhile, the Master Criminal reappears personally, taking an interest not only in illegally obtained antiquities but in the person of Amelia herself. The story is key in the series because it is the first time the reader learns the pseudonym of the Master Criminal: Sethos. It is the name of a number of Pharaohs, and is tied to Set or Seth, the Egyptian god of the desert. Sethos interacts in a number of ways, including offering gifts and returning the communion set stolen from Mazghuna the previous year.

Strand plain in Western Netherlands in 100 AD A strand plain or strandplain is a broad belt of sand along a shoreline with a surface exhibiting well-defined parallel or semi- parallel sand ridges separated by shallow swales. A strand plain differs from a barrier island in that it lacks either the lagoons or tidal marshes that separate a barrier island from the shoreline to which the strand plain is directly attached. Also, the tidal channels and inlets which cut through barrier islands are absent. Strand plains typically are created by the redistribution by waves and longshore currents of coarse sediment on either side of a river mouth.

In 1993, he moved to Harvard University as an assistant professor in the department of astronomy, where he was tenured three years later. Loeb has published nearly seven hundred papers on a broad range of research areas in astrophysics and cosmology, including the first stars, the epoch of reionization, the formation and evolution of massive black holes, the search for extraterrestrial life, gravitational lensing by planets, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) at high redshifts, 21-cm cosmology, the use of the Lyman-alpha forest to measure the acceleration/deceleration of the universe in real time (the so-called \\"Sandage–Loeb test\\"), the future collision between the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies, the future state of extragalactic astronomy, astrophysical implications of black hole recoil in galaxy mergers, tidal disruption of stars, and imaging black hole silhouettes. Some of his papers (e.g., on planet microlensing, and 21-cm cosmology) are considered as pioneering in areas that have become by now the focus of established communities of astrophysicists. Several of Loeb's early predictions were confirmed in recent years. In 1992, he suggested with Andy Gould that exoplanets could be detected through gravitational microlensing, a technique that is routinely used these days. In 1993, he proposed the use of the C+ fine-structure line to discover galaxies at high redshifts, as done routinely now. In 2005, he predicted in a series of papers with his postdoc at the time, Avery Broderick, how a hot spot in orbit around a black hole would appear; their predictions were confirmed in 2018 by the GRAVITY instrument on the VLT which observed a circular motion of the centroid of light of the black hole at the center of the Milky Way, SgrA*. In 2009, Broderick and Loeb predicted the shadow of the black hole in the giant elliptical galaxy M87, which was imaged in 2019 by the Event Horizon Telescope. In 2013, a report was published on the discovery of the \\"Einstein Planet\\" Kepler 76b, the first Jupiter size exoplanet identified through the detection of relativistic beaming of its parent star, based on a technique proposed by Loeb and Gaudi in 2003. In addition, a pulsar was discovered around the supermassive black hole, SgrA*, following a prediction by Pfahl and Loeb in 2004. Also, a hypervelocity star candidate from the Andromeda galaxy was discovered, as predicted by Sherwin, Loeb, and O'Leary in 2008. Together with Paolo Pani, Loeb showed in 2013 that primordial black holes in the range between the masses of the Moon and the Sun cannot make up the dark matter, another result reported in TIME magazine. He led a team that discovered tentative evidence for the birth of a black hole in the young nearby supernova SN1979C. In collaboration with Dan Maoz, Loeb demonstrated in 2013 that biomarkers, such as molecular oxygen (), can be detected by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) over the next decade in the atmosphere of Earth-mass planets in the habitable zone of white dwarfs. Together with his postdoc, James Guillochon, Loeb predicted the existence of a new population of stars moving near the speed of light throughout the universe. Together with his postdoc John Forbes and Howard Chen of Northwestern University, Loeb made another prediction that sub-Neptune sized exoplanets have been transformed into rocky super-Earths by the activity of Milky Way's central supermassive black-hole Sagittarius A*. = Early Universe = Loeb was among the very first theorists to trigger the research frontier on the \\"cosmic dawn\\" of the first stars and galaxies. In a series of papers with his students and postdocs, he addressed how and when the first stars and black holes formed and what effects they had on the young universe. Together with his former student Steve Furlanetto (currently a professor at UCLA), Loeb published in December 2012 an extensive textbook entitled \\"The First Galaxies in the Universe\\". In 2013, Loeb introduced the new concept of \\"The Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe\\", and mentored Harvard undergraduate, Henry Lin, in the study of industrial pollution on exoplanets as a new method to search for extraterrestrial civilizations. = ʻOumuamua = In December 2017, Loeb cited ʻOumuamua's unusually elongated shape as one of the reasons why the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia would listen for radio emissions from it to see if there were any unexpected signs that it might be of artificial origin, although earlier limited observations by other radio telescopes such as the SETI Institute's Allen Telescope Array had produced no such results. On 13 December 2017, the Green Bank Telescope observed the asteroid for six hours across four bands of radio frequency. No radio signals from ʻOumuamua were detected in this very limited scanning range, but observations are ongoing. On 26 October 2018, Loeb and his postdoc Shmuel Bialy submitted a paper exploring the possibility of the interstellar object ʻOumuamua being an artificial thin solar sail accelerated by solar radiation pressure in an effort to help explain the object's non-gravitational acceleration. Other scientists have stated that the available evidence is insufficient to consider such a premise,Scientists push back against Harvard 'alien spacecraft' theory. Kerry Sheridan, PhysOrg. 7 November 2018. and that a tumbling solar sail would not be able to accelerate.Cigar-shaped interstellar object may have been an alien probe, Harvard paper claims. CNN News. 6 November 2018. In response, Loeb wrote an article detailing six anomalous properties of \`Oumuamua that make it unusual, unlike any comets or asteroids seen before. On 27 November 2018, Loeb and his undergraduate student at Harvard College, Amir Siraj, proposed a search for \`Oumuamua-like objects which are trapped in the Solar System as a result of losing orbital energy through a close encounter with Jupiter. They identified 4 candidates for trapped interstellar objects that could be visited by dedicated missions (2011 SP25, 2017 RR2, 2017 SV13, and 2018 TL6). The authors pointed out that future sky surveys, such as with LSST, should find many more. In public interviews and private communications with reporters and academic colleagues, Loeb has become increasingly vocal regarding the prospects of proving the existence of alien life. On April 16, 2019, Loeb and his undergraduate student, Amir Siraj, reported the discovery of the first meteor of interstellar origin. This discovery pioneers a new path for studying the composition and nature of interstellar objects. Loeb is completing a popular-level book titled \\"Extraterrestrial: The First Sign of Intelligent Life Beyond Earth\\" to be published by HMH on January 26, 2021, with translations to more than twenty languages. He also co-authors a textbook on \\"Life in the Cosmos: From Bio-Signatures to Techno-Signatures\\" with his former postdoc, Manasvi Lingam, to be published in 2021 by Harvard University Press.  Media appearances  In 2006, Loeb was featured in a cover story of TIME magazine on the first stars and in a Scientific American article on the Dark Ages of the universe. In 2008, he was featured in a cover story of Smithsonian magazine on black holes and in two cover stories of Astronomy Magazine, one on the collision between the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy and the second on the future state of our universe. In 2009, Loeb reviewed in a Scientific American article a new technique for imaging black hole silhouettes. In 2010 he wrote a textbook entitled \\"How Did the First Stars and Galaxies Form?\\",\\"How Did the First Stars and Galaxies Form?\\" book jacket (pdf) published by Princeton University Press. In the same year, Loeb wrote an article encouraging young researchers to be creative. Loeb received considerable media attention after proposing in 2011 (with E.L. Turner) a new technique for detecting artificially-illuminated objects in the Solar System and beyond, and showing in 2012 (with I. Ginsburg) that planets may transit hypervelocity stars or get kicked to a fraction of the speed of light near the black hole at the center of the Milky Way. Science magazine published a detailed article about Loeb's career in April 2013, and Discover magazine reviewed his pioneering research on the first stars in April 2014. The New York Times published a science profile of Loeb in December 2014. In May 2015, Astronomy magazine posted a podcast of an hour-long interview with Loeb in its series entitled \\"Superstars of Astronomy\\". In April 2016, Stephen Hawking visited Loeb's home and attended the inaugurations of the Starshot and Black Hole Initiatives that Loeb leads. Loeb's latest eBook on Kindle details his career path from childhood on a farm with interests in philosophy to chairing the Harvard Astronomy department and directing the ITC, and includes opinion essays on the importance of taking risks in research and promoting diversity. Loeb regularly writes timely opinion essays on science and policy.  Honors and awards  Loeb has received many honors, including the Kennedy Prize in 1987, the Guggenheim Fellowship in 2002, the Salpeter Lectureship at Cornell University in 2006, the Bahcall Lectureship at Tel Aviv University in 2006, the Merle Kingsley Lectureship at Caltech in 2007, the Australian Institute of Physics Lectureship at the University of Melbourne in 2007, the Distinguished Visiting Lectureship at the Carnegie Observatories in 2009, the Las Cumbres Observatory Lectureship at Santa Barbara in 2011, the Sackler Lectureship at Leiden Observatory in 2011, the Galileo Galilei Chair (\\"Cattedra Galileiana\\") for 2011–12 from Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa, Italy, and the Miegunyah Distinguished Visiting Fellowship for 2013 at the University of Melbourne in Australia. For over two decades he held a visiting professorship at the Weizmann Institute of Science, and since 2011 he was awarded a Sackler Professorship by special appointment in the School of Physics and Astronomy at Tel Aviv University. In 2012 Loeb was elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2013, he was awarded the Chambliss Astronomical Writing Award by the American Astronomical Society for the book he published in 2010.

Some of the ancients regarded him as the real founder of tragedy. Phrynichus is said to have died in Sicily. His son Polyphrasmon was also a playwright. Works He gained his first victory in a drama contest in 511 BC. His famous play, the Capture of Miletus or the Sack of Miletus, was probably composed shortly after the conquest of that city by the Persians during the Ionian Revolt. Miletus was a colony of Athens and therefore traditionally held especially dear to the mother city. The audience was moved to tears by Phrynichus' tragedy, with the poet being fined \\"\\", \\"for reminding familiar misfortunes\\". As a result, the play was banned from being performed again. (Herodotus 6.21.10) In 476 BC Phrynichus was successful with the Phoenissae, called after the Phoenician women who formed the chorus. This drama celebrated the defeat of Xerxes I at the Battle of Salamis four years earlier. Themistocles provided the funds as choregos (producer), and one of the objectives of the play was to remind the Athenians of his great deeds. The Persians of Aeschylus (472 BC) was modeled after the Phoenissae. The titles of his other known plays (Actaeon, Alcestis, Antaeus, Daughters of Danaus, Egyptians, Pleuroniai, and Tantalus) show that he dealt with mythological as well as contemporary subjects. He introduced a separate actor, as distinct from the leader of the chorus, and thus laid the foundation for theatrical dialogue. But in his plays, as in the early tragedies generally, the dramatic element was subordinate to the lyric element as represented by the chorus and the dance. According to the Suda, Phrynichus first introduced female characters on the stage (played by men in masks), and made special use of the trochaic tetrameterSuda φ 762. Recognition Aelian (Claudius Aelianus), in his Varia Historia (3.8), says that Phrynichus' martial verses so stirred the people of Athens, they made him a general.

It included the land surrounding both sides of the Skånevikfjorden and its smaller branches: the Åkrafjorden and Matersfjorden in the present-day Etne Municipality and Kvinnherad Municipality. It also included the eastern part of the island of Halsnøya and stretched quite a ways inland all the way to the Folgefonna glacier. The administrative centre of the municipality was the village of Skånevik where Skånevik Church is located. History The parish of Skonevig was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). The spelling of the name was changed in the early 20th century to its present spelling of Skånevik. On 1 January 1965, the municipality of Skånevik was dissolved due to the recommendations of the Schei Committee during a period of many municipal mergers across Norway. The area of Skånevik situated south of the Skånevikfjord and Åkrafjorden, as well as the parts of Skånevik located north of the fjord and east of the village of Åkra (population: 1,493) were merged with the neighboring municipality of Etne to the south.

Usually, an ecological collapse is precipitated by a disastrous event occurring on a short time scale. Ecological collapse can be considered as a consequence of ecosystem collapse on the biotic elements that depended on the original ecosystem. Ecosystems have the ability to rebound from a disruptive agent. The difference between collapse or a gentle rebound is determined by two factors—the toxicity of the introduced element and the resiliency of the original ecosystem. Through natural selection the planet's species have continuously adapted to change through variation in their biological composition and distribution. Mathematically it can be demonstrated that greater numbers of different biological factors tend to dampen fluctuations in each of the individual factors. Scientists can predict tipping points for ecological collapse. The most frequently used model for predicting food web collapse is called R50, which is a reliable measurement model for food web robustness. Causes and examples Although, there is no single cause for ecological collapse, attributing factors include asteroid impacts, extremely large volcanic eruptions, and abrupt climate change. The snowball effect of these attributing factors and ecological collapse are demonstrated within the fossil record. Prehistoric examples include the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse, the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, the Permian–Triassic extinction event, and other mass extinctions. For example, effects of climate change as a contributing factor towards ecological collapse are demonstrated in the Ordovician–Silurian extinction events. A possible cause of the Ordovician Extinction was global cooling which affected the habitats of marine life. Consequently, sea creatures such as trilobites, brachiopods, and graptolites became extinct. Furthermore, Karabonov and colleagues conducted a study to show how during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), alternations in the environment and climate led to ecological collapse in Lake Baikal and Lake Hovsgol which then led to species evolution in these systems. The collapse of Hovsgol's ecosystem during the LGM brought forth a new ecosystem, with limited biodiversity in species and low levels of endemism, in Hovsgol during the Holocene. Karabonov's study also shows that ecological collapse during LGM in Lake Hovsgol led to higher levels of diversity and higher levels of endemism as a byproduct of evolution following the ecological collapse of the LGM. The Ordovician Extinction event and Lake Baikal and Hovsgol demonstrate two effects of ecological collapse on prehistoric environments. Historic examples include the collapse of the Grand Banks cod in the early 1990s, attributed to overfishing. Important pressures contributing to current and future ecological collapse include habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation, overgrazing, overexploitation of ecosystems by humans, human industrial growth and overpopulation, climate change, ocean acidification, pollution, and invasive species. Rainforest collapse Rainforest collapse refers to the actual past and theoretical future ecological collapse of rainforests. It may involve habitat fragmentation to the point where little rainforest biome is left, and rainforest species only survive in isolated refugia. Habitat fragmentation can be caused by roads. When humans start to cut down the trees for logging, secondary roads are created that will go unused after its primary use. Once abandoned, the plants of the rainforest will find it difficult to grow back in that area. Forest fragmentation also opens the path for illegal hunting. Species have a hard time finding a new place to settle in these fragments causing ecological collapse. This leads to extinction of many animals in the rainforest. = Carboniferous period = In the Carboniferous period, coal forests, great tropical wetlands, extended over much of Euramerica (Europe and America). This land supported towering lycopsids which fragmented and collapsed abruptly. The collapse of the rainforests during the Carboniferous has been attributed to multiple causes, including climate change. Specifically, at this time climate became cooler and drier, conditions that are not favourable to the growth of rainforests and much of the biodiversity within them. This sudden collapse affected several large groups including lycopsids and amphibians. Reptiles prospered in the new environment due to adaptations that let them thrive in drier conditions. Fishbone pattern of rainforest fragmentation  Today  Possible tipping points in the climate system =Terrestrial examples= A classic pattern of forest fragmentation is occurring in many rainforests including those of the Amazon, specifically a 'fishbone' pattern formed by the development of roads into the forest. This is of great concern, not only because of the loss of a biome with many untapped resources and wholesale death of living organisms, but also because plant and animal species extinction is known to correlate with habitat fragmentation. Overgrazing was found to cause land degradation, specifically in Southern Europe, which is another driver of ecological collapse and natural landscape loss. Proper management of pastoral landscapes can mitigate risk of desertification. =Oceans= In 2010 of oil was dumped into the Gulf of Mexico when BP's Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded. The effects of the BP oil spill will continue to be felt by future generations, as contamination has been found throughout the entire food chain. More than 8,000 marine birds, sea turtles and marine mammals were found dead or injured within months of the clean up effort. The impact of this disaster has unbalanced the food web of the environment. The oil spill occurred at the height of breeding season and as result affected egg and larval animals to the worst extent wiping entire age classes. This loss of a generation down the line will prove dire for future predators of the ecosystem. In addition, a major concern for marine biologists is the effects of ecological collapse on the coral reefs (who based on fossil evidence are more vulnerable to extinction but also demonstrate greater resilience). An effect of global climate change is the rising sea levels which can lead to reef drowning or coral bleaching. Human activity, such as fishing, mining, deforestation, etc., serves as a threat for coral reefs by affecting the niche of the coral reefs. For example, Edinger and colleagues demonstrate a correlation between a loss in diversity of coral reefs by 30-60% and human activity such as sewage and/or industrial pollution. Log–log linear relationship between the spatial area and the temporal duration of 42 observed Earth system regime shifts The world ocean is in great danger of collapse. In a study of 154 different marine fish species, David Byler found out that many factors such as overfishing, climate change, and fast growth of fish populations will cause ecosystem collapse. When humans fish, they usually will fish the populations of the higher trophic levels such as salmon and tuna. The depletion of these trophic levels allow the lower trophic level to overpopulate, or populate very rapidly. For example, when the population of catfish is depleting due to overfishing, plankton will then overpopulate because their natural predator is being killed off. This causes an issue called eutrophication. Since the population all consumes oxygen the dissolved oxygen levels will plummet. The dissolved oxygen levels dropping will cause all the species in that area to have to leave, or they will suffocate. This along with climate change, and ocean acidification can cause the collapse of an ecosystem. =Scientific research= Some scientists predict that a global ecological collapse will occur after 50% of the natural landscape is gone due to human development. There is evidence that even large ecosystems can collapse on relatively short timescales, disproportionately faster than smaller ecosystems. A paper suggests that once a 'point of no return' is reached, breakdowns do not occur gradually but rapidly and that the Amazon rainforest could shift to a savannah-type mixture of trees and grass within 50 years and the Caribbean coral reefs could collapse within 15 years once a state of collapse has been reached.  Consequences  Although the causes of ecological collapse are due to factors unique to their environment, they all for the most part share similar ramifications such as loss in biodiversity, trophic cascades, and even extinction. For example, the urbanization and deforestation of the South east Asian Pacific has led to the extinction of three plant species and eight animal species in 2003.

Derived from Middle Persian warāz meaning \\"boar\\" combined with Middle Persian dātan \\"to give\\", the name Varazdat () roughly means \\"given by boars\\" or \\"giver of boars,\\"Behind the name, accessed February 2014. a boar being a symbol for valor and fierceness. Family & early life Varazdat was the nephew and successor of the previous Arsacid Armenian king Papas (Pap) who reigned from 370 until 374. According to Saint Mesrop Mashtots, the priest and historiographer of the Catholicos Nerses the Great, names the father of Varazdat as Anob, while the identity of the mother of Varazdat is unknown. The father of Varazdat, Anob who was an Arsacid prince was the older paternal half-brother of Papas. Also, according to Faustus of Byzantium (Book IV, Chapter 37), Varazdat proclaims himself as the nephew of Papas and the historian reveals Varazdat's relations to the Armenian Arsacids. Hence the paternal grandfather of Varazdat was the Arsacid monarch Arsaces II (Arshak II), who ruled as Roman client king of Armenia from 350 until 368 as his paternal grandmother was an unnamed woman whom Arsaces II married prior to his Armenian kingship, who died before the year 358. Little is known of his early life. Championship at Olympic Games Sometime before his Armenian kingship, Varazdat participated in the Olympic Games in Greece. He is often regarded as one of the last competitors in the Ancient Olympic Games.Wilson, Nigel (2006). Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece, Routledge (UK) Varazdat's victory in the bare-knuckle boxing event (pugilat) is recorded in Moses of Chorene's History of Armenia (3.40). Since he reigned from 374 until 378, conjecture places his victory in the 360s. Varazdat is the second recorded Armenian to participate in the Olympic Games, while the first was his ancestor Tiridates III of Armenia, before he served in his Armenian kingship.[Armenian Olympic Games Information] Varazdat's victory is also known from a surviving memorandum which is now kept at the Olympic Museum in Olympia, Greece. According to the \\"Chronicle of Eusebius,\\" the Olympic Games were banned in 394 by Emperor Theodosius as pagan. Accurate evidence of the latest games are missing: it is believed that the 293rd Olympic Games did not take place. Thus, the Armenian king Varazdat was one of the last winners of the ancient games. An initiative from the Armenian National Olympic Committee on May 8, 1998 a statue bust of Varazdat was installed at the International Olympic Academy in Olympia, Greece.Khanjyan, N., Ministry of Nature Protection of the Republic of Armenia – Specially Protected Nature Areas of Armenia, Yerevan – 2004, p.8 The sculptor of Varazdat's statue bust was Levon Tokmajyan. Appointment to the Arsacid throne Following the assassination of his uncle Papa, Roman emperor Valens sent Varazdat, who as a young man was highly reputed for his mental and physical gifts, to occupy the Armenian throne. At that time, Varazdat had been living in Rome for an unknown period of time. Varazdat began to rule under the regency of Mušeł I Mamikonian, whose family were pro-Roman. The Sasanian emperor Shapur II, having failed on the battlefield, now proposed to Valens in 375 that Armenia which he called the perpetual source of trouble, be evacuated or that Roman forces be withdrawn from the western part of Caucasian Iberia ruled by Sauromaces. The emperor rejected the proposal but sent two legates, the magister equitum Victor Magistrianus and Urbicius the dux of Mesopotamia to the Persian king to discuss the question. Shapur II was told that his demands were unjust because the inhabitants of Armenia had been granted the right to live according to their decisions.Ammianus Marcellinus, 30.2.4 - \\"ad arbitrium suum vivere coltoribus eius permissis.\\" Shapur II was also told that unless Roman troops assigned to protect the Iberian king in the west were allowed to pass unhindered, Shapur II would be forced into war with Rome. Valens was confident of this threat because he was counting on filling the ranks of his army with auxiliaries from the Goths that he had permitted to settle in Thrace. The two legates made a blunder during their return trip by accepting two regions (Asthianene and Belabitene) under Roman rule without proper authorization. This gave Shapur II a new bargaining chip to revive negotiations and in late 376 he sent Suren with an embassy offering Valens these two regions illegally accepted by the legates in exchange for Roman concessions. Suren was sent back with the message that Rome was unwilling to negotiate and would launch a tripartite invasion of Persia the following spring in 377. Shapur II responded by seizing back Asthianene and Belabitene and harassed the Roman troops in western Iberia. The Goths revolted in early 377 and Valens was forced to negotiate, eventually withdrawing Roman forces from Armenia in order to use them against the Goths. Valens himself died fighting the Goths in August 378 during the Battle of Adrianople. Varazdat like his uncle, aggressively promoted Arian Christianity. Decline and banishment The situation in Armenia deteriorated even further. Sometime after the withdrawal of the Roman forces, Varazdat killed the regent Mušeł Mamikonian. The vacant position of sparapet was quickly filled by Manuel Mamikonian who had served under Shapur II in the most recent Kushan war. Manuel took up arms against Varazdat and forced him to flee from Armenia in 378, after four years of reign. Varazdat sought refuge in Rome. Manuel together with Papas' widow Zarmandukht, and their first son Arsaces III (Arshak III) formed a new provisional government allied with Persia. Shapur II garrisoned a 10,000 man army in Armenia under Suren, much like Valens in 377. Eventually Manuel revolted against Persia and defended Armenian sovereignty against both Rome and Persia throughout the 380s until his death. Valens sent Varazdat to the British Isles.Lang, David Marshall. Armenia: Cradle of Civilization. (Boston: George Allen & Unwin, 1970) p. 162 Varazdat most probably died in exile and the date of his death is unknown. Family & issue Archaeological evidence and the ancient Armenian and Roman historical sources of the period do not indicate that Varazdat had a wife or any children. However, modern genealogies present Varazdat as being the father of Khosrov IV and Vramshapuh.

Earlier, the company built military vehicles and some tanks during World War II, and until the late 1950s or early 1960s was a manufacturer of trucks and trolley buses. Marmon- Herrington had a partnership with Ford Motor Company, producing trucks and other commercial vehicles, such as buses. The company may be best known for its all-wheel-drive conversions to other truck maker's units, especially to Ford truck models. Founded in 1931, Marmon-Herrington was based in Indianapolis, Indiana, with a plant in Windsor, Ontario, and remained in Indianapolis until 1963. It is now based in Louisville, Kentucky. History Marmon-Herrington all-wheel-drive converted Ford 1/2-ton truck. Delivered in small numbers to the U.S. and Belgian Armies, and some other countries, circa 1936. Two Marmon-Herrington CTLS (Combat Tank Light Series) U.S. tanks maneuvering in a mountain pass in Alaska in 1942. Founded in 1931 by Walter C. Marmon and Arthur W. Herrington, the company was the successor to the Marmon Motor Car Company, a maker of high quality, costly automobiles from 1902 to 1933. By the early 1930s, the U.S. economy had taken a severe downturn, and with the onset of the Great Depression, the market for prestigious luxury cars mostly collapsed. To keep his business going, Marmon joined forces with an ex- military engineer in the person of Arthur Herrington in 1931, with a new idea to focus on building all-wheel-drive trucks.Borth, Christy. Masters of Mass Production, pp. 215-6, 225, Bobbs-Merrill Co., Indianapolis, IN, 1945. And so the company became Marmon-Herrington, initially as the truck production division of the Marmon Motor Car Company, developing military trucks. Marmon- Herrington (MH) got off to a successful start in March 1931, when the company procured contracts for 33 T-1 4x4 aircraft refueling trucks, powered by 6-cylinder Hercules engines, followed by a variety of 4x4 and 6x6 vehicles for the U.S. and Persian armies, for use as general load carriers, towing light weaponry, mobile machine shops, and wreckers. Reconnaissance, scout and armored cars were also made, some with four-wheel steering as well as four- wheel drive. In 1932 Marmon-Herrington built the first all-wheel-drive truck and trailer combination, and the largest trucks ever built at the time, for oil pipe construction in Iraq. Construction of all-wheel-drive (AWD) vehicles and conversion of existing vehicles to AWD were among the company's products. MH's all-wheel-drive conversions of Ford light trucks were successfully sold to the military of both the U.S. and several foreign governments. Marmon-Herrington also made multi-stop delivery vans and passenger vehicles. The company designed a military armoured vehicle which could be constructed on a commercial truck chassis. The design was taken up by South Africa in 1938, the result of which became known as the Marmon-Herrington Armoured Car, which was used by British and Commonwealth armies in the North Africa Campaign. A 1940 Ford/Marmon-Herrington dump truck preserved at the Pacific Northwest Truck Museum, in Oregon During World War II the British were looking for a purpose-built airborne light tank to replace the Tetrarch light tank but decided not to produce the tank in Britain due to a lack of production capacity. Instead, the American government was approached with a request that it produce a replacement for the Tetrarch.Flint, p. 23. This request was made by the British Air Commission in Washington, D.C., with a proposal calling for a tank of between and to be developed, this being the maximum weight the War Office had decided could be carried by current glider technology. The United States Ordnance Department was given the task of developing the proposed tank, and in turn, requested designs from three American companies: General Motors, J. Walter Christie and Marmon-Herrington. The design offered by Christie in mid-1941 was rejected as it failed to meet the specified size requirements, as was a modified design the company produced in November.Zaloga, M551 Sheridan, p. 5. At a conference in May 1941, the Ordnance Department chose the Marmon- Herrington design and requested that the company produce a prototype tank, which was completed in late 1941; it was designated the Light Tank T9 (Airborne) by the company and the Ordnance Department and later designated M22.Flint, p. 24. The company also manufactured airport fire trucks, like the Marmon Herrington MB-1 and Marmon Herrington MB-5. They were mainly used by the military, like the U.S Air Force and U.S. Navy. Post-War civilian adaptations, known as \\"Brush Breakers\\", were also produced. Trolley buses Dayton, Ohio trolleybus system. The company's foray into transit buses began in 1946, when it produced its first electric trolley bus. The end of World War II had brought a steep drop in the need for military vehicles, so Marmon- Herrington looked for another area of vehicle manufacturing in which it might find new business.Sebree, Mac; and Ward, Paul (1973). Transit's Stepchild: The Trolley Coach. Los Angeles: Interurbans. LCCN 73-84356. Its first \\"trolley coaches\\", the more common term for trolley buses at that time, introduced innovative features such as lightweight monocoque bodies and strong, double- girder sidewalls, which made the Marmon-Herrington trolley coach the best- selling trolley coach of the postwar era. Its trolley buses were successful in the fleets of many North American cities, most notably Chicago and San Francisco, which purchased large numbers; Chicago bought 349 in a single order (delivered in 1951–52), a record for the MH company. Marmon-Herrington supplied trolley buses to 16 different cities in the United States, among the buyers being the Cincinnati Street Railway Company, which purchased 214, and the Cleveland Railway, with 125;Porter, Harry; and Worris, Stanley F.X. (1979). Trolleybus Bulletin No. 109: Databook II. North American Trackless Trolley Association (defunct). vehicles were also sold to two cities in Brazil. The principal models were the TC44, TC48, and TC49, with the number denoting the number of seats.

Some MH trolley buses withdrawn from service in the United States were sold secondhand to Mexico City's Servicio de Transportes Eléctricos (STE) between the late 1960s and late 1970s and continued in service for many more years on that city's trolley bus network.Sebree, Mac; and Ward, Paul (1974).

Although the last Marmon-Herrington trolley buses in original form were retired by STE in 1988, many underwent a rebuilding of their bodies in the 1980s by the Mexican company Moyada and continued working; the last five of these Moyada-remodeled Marmon-Herrington trolley buses of STE survived in service until 2002.Trolleybus Magazine No. 246 (November–December 2002), p. 138. ISSN 0266-7452. By the late 1950s, the market for new trolley buses in North America had dried up, as some trolley bus systems were being abandoned while others had re-equipped with new MH vehicles. The company's very last orders for transit vehicles were also its only export orders for trolley buses, to Recife and Belo Horizonte in Brazil, comprising 65 and 50 TC49s, respectively, delivered in 1958–59. Recife overhauled some of its TC49s in the 1980s, and several remained in service until 2001.Morgan, Steve (2001). \\"Recife in Transition\\", Trolleybus Magazine No. 240 (November–December 2001), pp. 129–135. The Illinois Railway Museum has preserved two ex-Chicago Transit Authority Marmon-Herrington trolley coaches and one ex-Milwaukee unit. 1960s to present In the early 1960s, the Pritzker family bought the company, and soon the focus on full vehicle manufacturing ended, the truck designs being sold to a new company that traded under the Marmon brand. Marmon-Herrington's longtime main plant and headquarters in Indianapolis was closed in 1963. The remaining production became part of an association of companies which in 1964 adopted the name Marmon Group. During the Cold war era, Marmon diversified its production line by adding aircraft, missiles and rockets ground support equipment, manufactured by its subsidiary, Cardair, based in Chicago, Illinois.Compression to 12,000 psi. // Aviation Week & Space Technology, Mid- December, 1960, v. 73, no. 27, p. 292. The MH company continues today as a converter of commercial trucks to all-wheel-drive (AWD) vehicles, as well as a manufacturer of transmissions, transfer cases, and axles for heavy vehicles.Marmon-Herrington – OEM Products Marmon-Herrington axles can still be found on even the newest military vehicles and commercial trucks. In addition to building installation kits for all-wheel-drive, the company has also become a front-drive-axle and transfer case manufacturer to the medium- and heavy- duty truck market.

The NPR was created on March 3, 1993. It was the eleventh federal reform effort in the 20th century. In early 1998, the National Performance Review was renamed to the National Partnership for Reinventing Government. History = Background = In March 1993, President Bill Clinton stated that he planned to \\"reinvent government\\" when he declared that \\"Our goal is to make the entire federal government less expensive and more efficient, and to change the culture of our national bureaucracy away from complacency and entitlement toward initiative and empowerment.\\" After this, Clinton put the project into Vice President Al Gore's hands with a six-month deadline for a proposal for the plan. The National Performance Review (NPR), which was later renamed the National Partnership for Reinventing Government, released its first report in September 1993, which contained 384 recommendations for improving bureaucracy's performance across the entire federal governmentInside the Reinvention Machine by Donald Kettl and John J. DiIlio, Jr., Brookings Institution Press, 1995. The report was the product of months’ worth of consultation of various government departments and meetings within Clinton's bureaucracy, which narrowed down 2,000 pages of proposals to the final report. NPR promised to save the federal government about $108 billion: $40.4 billion from a \\"smaller bureaucracy\\", $36.4 billion from program changes, and $22.5 billion from streamlining contracting processes. Each of the recommendations would fall into three categories: whether it required legislative action, presidential action, or internal bureaucratic reform. Major branches of bureaucracy that were targeted were the US Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Interior, the Agency for International Development (AID), Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Labor, and Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The first-year status report of the NPR claimed that, pending Congressional action, likely savings would amount to about $12.2 billion in 1994. In 1993, Congress rejected many key provisions of the NPR downsizing when it came to individual departmental cuts, proving that NPR could not sustain its reforms without modest congressional support. As Donald Kettl points out, the NPR's biggest hurdle was that \\"although [it] had a strategy leading to the release of its report on September 7, 1993, it had no strategy for September 8 and afterward.\\" Still, key legislation successfully passed throughout the reform effort was the NPR's procurement reforms—the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, the Federal Acquisition Reform Act of 1995, and the Clinger-Cohen Act in 1996. In a September 1996 pamphlet, Gore wrote that the federal government had reduced its workforce by nearly 24,000 as of January 1996, and that thirteen of the fourteen departments had reduced the size of their workforce. In addition, thousands of field offices that were considered \\"obsolete\\" closed.In September 1997, Gore reported that 2.8 million people left the welfare rolls between 1993 and 1997. 4 Federal Welfare-to-Work Commitments: a report to President Bill Clinton by Vice President Al Gore, June 1997. Toward the end of Clinton's first term, the task of the NPR became less to \\"review and recommend\\" and more to \\"support agencies in their reinventing goals\\", reflected in the change of the senior advisor from Elaine Kamarck to Morley Winograd. It was also around this time that the name change occurred to reflect more engagement with relevant public institutions such as student loans, the IRS, and emergency preparedness. = Creation = The creation of the National Partnership for Reinventing Government was announced during U.S. President Bill Clinton's address on March 3, 1993, to a special joint session of the United States CongressWinograd, Morley. \\"Getting Results Americans Care About.\\" Public Manager 27.3 (1998): 17. Academic Search Premier. Web. 19 Mar. 2012. This initiative was a reinvention of an effort formerly known as the National Performance Review, and consisted of a proposed six-month efficiency review of the federal government spearheaded by U.S. Vice President Al Gore. The aim for the initiative was to create a government that \\"works better, costs less, and gets results Americans care about.\\"Stone, Bob (03/01/1998). \\"Creating \`reinvention university.'\\". The Public Manager (Potomac, Md.) , 27 (1), p. 47. However, Vice President Gore went beyond preparing a report to lead an effort that evolved into the longest-running and, arguably, most successful reform effort in U.S. history to date. In the address to a joint session of Congress on March 3, 1993, President Clinton provided rationale for implementing the NPR: \\"The conditions which brought us as a nation to this point are well known. Two decades of low productivity growth and stagnant wages, persistent unemployment and underemployment, years of huge government and declining investment in our future, exploding health care costs, and lack of coverage for millions of Americans, legions of poor children, education and job training opportunities inadequate to the demands of this tough global economy.\\"\\"Clinton Text: \`Our Nation Needs a New Direction.\\" Los Angeles Times (pre-1997 Fulltext): 20. ABI/INFORM Complete; Los Angeles Times; ProQuest Central; ProQuest Criminal Justice. Feb 18 1993. Web. 19 Mar. 2012 The stated intention of the NPR was to \\"invent government that puts people first, by: serving its customers, empowering its employees, and fostering excellence.\\" In order to achieve this, the objectives of the NPR were to \\"create a clear sense of mission; delegate authority and responsibility; replace regulations with incentives; develop budget-based outcomes; and measure [our] success by customer satisfaction.\\" Clinton's address on March 3 was a call to arms aimed at both branches of government and the political parties. His proposition to establish and implement the NPR consisted of four components, detailing the shift from # consumption to investment in both the public and private sectors, # changing the rhetoric of public decision making so that it honors work and families, # substantially reducing federal debt, and # administering government spending and cuts. Gore presented the report of his National Performance Review to President Clinton and the public on September 7, 1993. Gore cited the long- term goal was to \\"change the very culture of the federal government,\\" and designated \\"optimism\\" and \\"effective communication\\" as the keys to success of the NPR. In September 1993, the National Performance Review issued its initial report, noting that successful organizations—businesses, city and state governments, and organizations of the federal government—do four things well. These four things became the recipe for reinventing government: 1) Put customers first; 2) Cut red tape; 3) Empower employees to get results; 4) Cut back to basics.6\\\\. Al Gore. National Performance Review: The Vision Takes Hold. Government Publications Department, 1995. Print. = Legacy = The Hammer Award was created by Vice President Gore to recognize government efficiency as a part of the program. Made simply of a $6 hammer, a striped ribbon and an aluminum-framed note from Gore, the award parodies the Pentagon's infamous bloated hardware costs, including the infamous $436 hammer. (The cost of the hammer was actually an artifact of government accounting rules, and include not just the cost of the equipment but also a portion of the overhead cost of the entire project it was associated with.The myth of the $600 hammer) General trends in the federal government = NPR and streamlining = Many attempts at reducing red tape involved streamlining grant processes and listening to the recommendations of the NPR. The U.S. Department of Commerce \\"streamlin[ed] the internal grants process\\" in order to reduce the amount of paperwork involved in applications for financial assistance.Galston, William A. and Geoffrey L Tibbetts. \\"Reinventing Federalism: The Clinton/Gore Program for a New Partnership Among the Federal, State, Local, and Tribal Governments.\\" Publius 1994: 23–48. JSTOR. Web. 16 Apr. 2012. The Department of Transportation has transitioned to electronic submission of grant forms. The Alamo Federal Executive Board Reinvention Lab in Texas works to \\"remove unnecessary regulations… so that intergovernmental employees may work together as partners\\" and eliminate problems together. = NPR and national service = In addition to its association with executive branch reform, the NPR's reinvention movement is tightly bound to the idea of national service. In the words of President Bill Clinton, \\"National Service is nothing less than the American way to change America. It is rooted in the concept of community: the simple idea that every one of us, no matter how many privileges with which we are born, can still be enriched by the contributions of the least of us.\\"Lenkowsky, Leslie and James L. Perry. \\"Reinventing Government: The Case of National Service\\" Public Administration Review Aug. 2000: 298–307. JSTOR. Web. 17 Apr. 2012. Because National Service is so closely tied to the American citizens, Clinton and Gore recognized its role in government reinvention since a main purpose of the NPR is to respond to the needs of the people. In 1993, the Corporation for National Service (CNS) was created to further \\"develop and expand the President's reinvention themes.\\" Like the ideals of the National Performance Review, the main goal of the CNS was to yield fast results. Likewise, the CNS was dedicated to producing \\"well- informed decisions without delay, keep[ing] staffing lean and flexible, multiply[ing] resources, and delegat[ing] authority and responsibility in- house and in the field.\\"  Impact on government entities  = NPR and the Department of Housing and Urban Development = The original 168-page report of the National Performance Review made a total of 255 agency-specific recommendations, 10 of which were directed at the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). A few of these recommendations are listed below to show the type of request the government had in mind. The report recommended that HUD eliminate their annual budget reviews and work with congress to change rent rules that would create strong incentives for people to move from public housing as soon as they find jobs. A brief list as stated above of some of the recommendations for the Housing and Urban Development. # \\"Reinvent Public housing\\": This was to improve housing management, eliminate unnecessary procedures and help provide a broader range of choices for public housing tenants. # \\"Improving management over multifamily assets and disposition\\": This will help spot financial assets for the HUD and give them a better solution on how to act on public-private partnerships, issues with loans and reduce the tension placed upon them by the FHA insurance programs. # \\"Establish a New Housing Production Program\\": This recommendation is describing what needs to happen to improve availability for loans for multifamily housing, create a partnership between FHA, non-profits and the government to help resurrect old/dying neighborhoods. = NPR and defense spending = According to military strategist Isaiah Wilson III, there were two phases to the National Performance Review, the second of which was commenced on January 3, 1995, by Vice President Al Gore.Wilson, Isaiah. The Problem with Foreign Military Sales Reinvention. World Affairs; 2001. The aim of Phase 2 was to \\"examine the basic mission of government…to find and eliminate things that don’t need to be done by the government.\\" While another focus of the NPR was to cut down on red tape bureaucracy, in regards to the adjustments made to the Defense Department, Wilson argues that a fundamental step towards actual reinvention was skipped. The Arms Export Control Act, which is viewed as the essential piece of legislation regarding the trading of arms and related technologies, has remained essentially untouched since 1976 even after phase 2 of the NPR. Defense spending, in regards to its relativity to the NPR, began to decrease in 1991, after the Cold War. This trend continued until 2001's terrorist attacks, and the war on terror began. The conclusion can be made that the NPR did not greatly affect defense spending, rather defense spending is greatly dependent on international affairs and conflict. There was very little way for the NPR to adjust governmental spending on defense, as the Defense Department in the United States is a larger, more independent agency of the government. It is important to note that while the defense budget has fluctuated by billions of dollars, the U.S. Defense spending in relativity to percentage of U.S. GDP has only fluctuated within 1–2%. The NPR also aimed to improve general customer satisfaction with all dealings involving the federal government. In terms of foreign military sales, however, there is a dilemma of whether or not the federal government's main \\"customer\\" should be the foreign nations purchasing arms and technologies or the American taxpayer who in part pays for the service provided by the defense department. = NPR and shrinking workforce = Downsizing was a common goal for every factor of government including management. After decades of ineffective government the Clinton-Gore administration and their team of advisers were looking for a solution. Gore recognized that the problem passed the restricted system government employees have to work within. Gore instead decided to look from the top to bottom. Supervisor are found at every level of government and have a direct influence on the employee and the workplace. The NPR sought to drive supervisors to take accountability for their unproductive work. With multiple pressures from legislature Clinton constructed a proposal to \\"eliminate decentralization. The NPR believed that by removing the United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) there would be a decrease in decentralization. Past methods of employment through this agency made applicants apply to multiple civil service jobs rather than just the job of their interest. In result managers were given more human resource responsibility and could \\"control the outcome of their employees’ career. Despite the employee gaining the ability to apply to individual organizations there was criticism of the shrinking government. Dean of the school of Public policy at the University of Maryland, Donald Kettl recalls the problem of the shrinking government stating \\"The reduction didn’t happen in a way that matched workforce needs because they used a strategy for downsizing to hit a target\\". Kettl also believed that the idea of downsizing public service was a higher priority than actually making the system better itself. The NPR sought to eliminate \\"inspectors general, controllers, procurement officers and personnel specialists. Project Director and \\"Energizer in Chief\\" Bob Stone aimed for a no-layoff policy but failed. Stone worked closely with the OPM to gain support for a buyout program that offered payments up to 50,000 to persuade employees to leave. As a result, more than 25,000 employees were laid off. = NPR and the Government Printing Office = Apart from Defense spending, the NPR also narrowed its sights on government printing, namely the operation of the Government Printing Office (GPO).Peterson, Eric C. The Impact of the National Performance Review and Other Forces on the Rights of an Informed Citizenry: A Case Study in Reinvention-Reforming Government Publishing. Government Information Quarterly, pp. 383–392. 1998. According to recommendations made by the NPR, the GPO was seen as a monopoly on government printing and was responsible for great spending waste. The three specific recommendations read as follow: # Authorize the executive branch to establish a printing policy that will eliminate the current printing monopoly. # Ensure public access to federal information. # Develop integrated electronic access to government information and services. = NPR and the Executive Branch = One way Vice President Al Gore intended to put his plan into action was by reducing the number of workers in the executive branch. Many agencies saw the downsizing as detrimental to their efficiency because it left them \\"shorthanded in the delivery of programs and services.\\"Barr, Stephen. \\"Reinventing Government Is an Idea Whose Time Has Come—Again.\\" The Washington Post 22 Oct. 2000. LexisNexis. Web. 16 Apr. 2012. However, Gore recognized that a smaller workforce would allow agencies to focus on customer service instead of managing an unnecessary number of workers. This emphasis on customer service coincides with Gore's determination to focus on what the citizens want from the government. Aside from diminishing the size of executive agencies, the report also suggests \\"redefin[ing] the role of the institutional presidency\\" by reducing the management role. This would involve \\"devolving management authority to the lowest level possible and shift[ing] accountability from the President to agency ‘customers.\\"Moe, Ronald C. \\"The ‘Reinventing Government’ Exercise: Misinterpreting the Problem, Misjudging the Consequences\\" Public Administration Review Apr. 1994: 111–122. JSTOR. Web. 17 Apr. 2012. In this case, lowest level refers to the interagency committees; however, management duties would be assigned to \\"the politically appointed leadership in the departments and agencies.  Other similar commissions  While government reformation efforts often come relatively soon into a president's term, it is rare for president-elects to push for reform immediately on taking office. Presidents often realize the need for reform relatively quickly in order to make their policy goals achievable. These efforts may arise for a variety of reasons, whether substantive or symbolic. The substantive reasons may include motives such as \\"enhancing the capacity of the president to manage the bureaucracy, rationalizing the structure of government, and making career officials more responsive to political direction.\\"Thompson, James (2000). \\"Reinvention as Reform: Assessing the National Performance Review\\". Public Administration Review. 60: 508–521 – via JSTOR. Symbolic reform proposals are oftentimes associated with the state of the economy, the amount of waste produced by government organizations, among other reasons. Government reform has been practiced for over a century, beginning in 1905 with Theodore Roosevelt's Keep Commission. The following are examples of reformation commissions: * Brownlow Committee 1937 * Hoover Commission two commissions in 1947–1949 and 1953–1955. * The Grace Commission 1982–1984 * Project on National Security Reform 2006–present References http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=ed616c2f-ff03-4cee-98c8-6913350d07ac@sessionmgr4010&vid;=2&hid;=4213 Clinton Administration initiatives History of the United States government United States national commissions ","title":"National Partnership for Reinventing Government"},{"id":"5021260","text":"Starlight & Shadows is a series of novels by Elaine Cunningham, set in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting.

He qualified on the pole position for NASCAR's first Strictly Stock (now NASCAR Cup Series) race and, along with Red Byron, is considered one of the two best drivers from that era. Flock family He was the brother of NASCAR pioneers Tim Flock and Fonty Flock, and the second female NASCAR driver Ethel Mobley. The four raced at the July 10, 1949 race at the Daytona Beach Road Course, which was the first event to feature a brother and a sister, and the only NASCAR event to feature four siblings. Ethel beat Fonty and Bob by finishing in eleventh. Moonshine business The Flock family had an illegal moonshine business. The federal agents discovered that Flock would be running a race in Atlanta, and they staked out the place to make an arrest. A gate opened as the race was beginning, and he drove on the track to take the green flag. The police vehicles quickly appeared on the track. They chased Flock for a lap or two before he drove through the fence. The police followed him until he ran out of gas. Reminiscing years later, Flock said, \\"I would have won that race if the cops had stayed out of it.\\" Racing career He was a well established driver before NASCAR was formed. He took over NASCAR founder Bill France's ride in 1946. He won both events at the Daytona Beach Road Course in 1947. Flock was known for his daring driving style. For example, during a race on June 15, 1947, Flock overturned his car in an accident. Instead of accepting a DNF, he solicited help from spectators, who turned the car back on its wheels, and he finished the race: \\"Like other wrecks it wasn’t anywhere near as serious, and folks flipped Flock’s car over on its wheels.\\" In an October 1947 race at Piedmont Interstate Fairgrounds, he suffered a crushed vertebra when his tire blew, sending his car through the track fencing and into a light pole. He sat on the pole for NASCAR's first race at Charlotte Speedway on June 19, 1949, setting a qualifying time of 38.37 seconds. He had two wins that season, and finished third in the points behind Lee Petty and champion Red Byron. Flock was the only winner of a Cup Series race held at the mysterious Air Base Speedway in Greenville, SC in 1951 on August 25. His brothers, Tim and Fonty also took part in the event.https://www.racing-reference.info/race/1951-23/W The track was closed in 1952 after only three years of racing but was still visible by 1964 and only partially by 1976.

He was successively bishop of Durango (1670 to 1681), of Guatemala (1681 to 1684) and of Michoacán (1684 to March 24, 1700), and then archbishop of Mexico (June 21, 1700 to December 16, 1708). He also served as interim viceroy of New Spain from February 27, 1696 to December 18, 1696 and again from November 4, 1701 to November 27, 1702. Education and ecclesiastical career Ortega y Montañés was a native of Cartagena. Some sources give a different birth date: June 23, 1627. He studied at Cartagena, at Málaga, and at Alcalá de Henares, where he graduated with a doctorate in jurisprudence. He was named inquisitor for New Spain, and it was there that he entered the service of the Church. He was bishop of Durango, then Guatemala, then Michoacán (Valladolid). He was known for his opposition to clerical abuse and arbitrariness, and also for his support of simple happiness and poverty among the clergy. He had also a reputation for charity, concern for the parishioners, and energy in his work. First term as viceroy In February 1696 he was named interim viceroy of New Spain, to succeed Gaspar de la Cerda, 8th Count of Galve. One of the first challenges of his administration was the suppression of an uprising of university students. On March 27, 1696 they tried to burn the scaffold in the Plaza de Armas, which they saw as \\"an annoying manifestation of the power of the monarchy.\\" This caused great alarm in Mexico City. The constables broke up the demonstration, arresting a youth named Francisco González de Castro. The students tried to rescue him as he was being escorted to jail, pelting the constables with rocks. The other important event of this viceroy's first term was the sending of a Jesuit expedition to evangelize and colonize the Californias. This expedition included the famous missionary fathers Eusebio Kino and Juan María Salvatierra. The two fathers had founded the Fondo Piadoso de California on August 15, 1696 to continue the work of colonization. A new viceroy, José Sarmiento y Valladares, conde de Moctezuma y de Tula, took up the government on December 13, 1696, and Bishop Ortega y Montañés returned to his see in Michoacán. He remained there until March, 1700, when he was made archbishop of Mexico. Second term as viceroy A ship arrived in Veracruz on March 6, 1701 carrying the news of the death of King Charles II of Spain on November 1 of the previous year. Charles II left no heir. The War of the Spanish Succession, between Spain and France on the one hand and Austria, England and Holland on the other, began to determine his successor. The viceroy at the time, Sarmiento y Valladares, was a supporter of the Habsburg claims to the Spanish throne. (The Bourbons were in control in Spain.) He was removed from office and Ortega was once again named interim viceroy. Ortega y Montañés's formal consecration as archbishop of Mexico occurred January 6, 1702, while he was again serving as viceroy. The archbishop was distinguished for his devotion to the Virgin of Guadalupe, patron of Mexico, whose church was finished under this administration (1702). The archbishop personally toured, asking for alms to support the construction. He suspended the transportation of prisoners from New Spain to Puerto Rico, which his predecessor Sarmiento y Valladares had begun. The viceroy received word that the conde de Chateau-Renaud had arrived in Havana with a French fleet to transport the tribute of New Spain to France. Viceroy Ortega consulted with the Audiencia, and the decision was reached not to turn over the tribute to the French without express orders from the Spanish Crown. On November 18, 1702, Archbishop Ortega left Mexico City for Otumba to welcome the new viceroy, Francisco Fernández de la Cueva, 10th Duke of Alburquerque, and turn over temporal power to him. Ortega died in 1708, still occupying the see of Mexico. He left behind various writings. These included Informe del Estado de la Nueva España, written for his first successor, José Sarmiento y Valladares. It was a report on the state of the colony at the end of the seventeenth century.

Her father wanted to marry her to the \\"best of the Hellenes\\" and, subsequently, he organized a competition, whose prize was the hand of his own daughter in marriage. According to his declaration, all the eligible young men had to appear in Sicyon within 60 days. Finally, twelve competitors appearedHerodotus 6.127: \\"From the city of Sybaris in Italy came Smindyrides, and from Siris came Damasus. Amphimnestus and Males made their way to Sicyon from the cities of the Ionian Gulf. The Peloponnesus sent Leocedes from Argos, Amiantus from Arcadia, Laphanes from Pæus, and Onomastus from Elis. From Eubœa came Lysanias; from Thessaly, Diactorides; from Molossia, Alcon; and from Attica, Megacles and Hippoclides. Of the last two, Megacles was the son of the renowned Alcmaeon, while Hippoclides was accounted the handsomest and wealthiest of the Athenians.\\" and Cleisthenes held a banquet in his guests' honour. Cleisthenes preferred the former archon Hippocleides but, during the dinner the suitor embarrassed himself. According to Herodotus, Hippocleides became intoxicated and began to act like a fool; at one point, he stood on his head and kicked his legs in the air, keeping time with the flute music. When Hippocleides was informed that he had \\"danced away his bride,\\" his response was , (\\"Hippocleides doesn't care\\" or \\"It doesn't matter to Hippocleides\\").Herodotus. The Histories, 6.129-6.130. Herodotus' description insinuates a bawdy pun: the phrase \\"danced the bride away\\" may also be read as \\"displayed your testicles\\", in reference to Hippoclides standing on his head while wearing a tunic, which would have exposed his genitals to the guests. After these unfortunate events, Megacles of the Alcmaeonid clan was chosen to marry Agariste, who gave birth to two sons, Hippocrates and Cleisthenes, the reformer of the Athenian democracy. Hippocrates was the father of another Megacles (ostracized 486 BC) and a daughter Agariste was the mother of Pericles and Ariphron (himself the father of Hippocrates of Athens who died 424 BC). The younger son Cleisthenes was allegedly father of Deinomache (or Dinomache), mother of Alcibiades (d. 404 BC)Hippocrates' daughter was Agariste, the mother of Pericles. Either Hippocrates's son Megacles or his younger brother Cleisthenes was maternal grandfather of Alcibiades. According to other sources, Pericles's mother and Alcibiades's mother's father were siblings, and Pericles and Deinomache were therefore cousins, which supports the latter contention. In either scenario, Agariste was a common ancestress of Pericles and Alcibiades. W. K. Lacey felt that Agariste was an epikleros, or sole heiress who was required to have children to perpetuate her father's family.Lacey, W. K.

Nearby cities include Mijas to the east, Marbella to the south, Istán to the west, and Monda and Coín to the north. Description Its name is oddly derived from an Arabic word, hoxán, meaning \\"rough\\" or \\"bitter\\" place, thus it is curious that the Moors should establish a settlement in a place they presumably did not care for. In common with other inland villages such as Istán, Ojén was spared the Christians' embargo on the Moors living too close to the sea after the Reconquest. The town is situated beside the Almadán stream above the valley of the River Real at an altitude of approximately 200 metres, hemmed in by the Sierra Blanca and the Sierra Alpujata. These may provide a clue to the Moors' determination to stay in spite of their apparent antipathy, for both ranges of mountains have long been known as rich sources of talc, nickel, iron and lead. This mineral wealth put the area in the forefront of the Spanish industrial revolution of the 19th century. Close by, in the Serranía de Ronda, is the Refugio de Juanar. Originally the private hunting lodge of the wealthy Larios family, and a favoured retreat of King Alfonso XIII, this is now a hotel popular with tourists and hunters. The Serranía is still very much a hunting reserve where ibex, wildcats and eagles abound. It is also a favourite with ramblers and hikers who come for the mountain air and the panoramic views of Marbella and the coast 1000 metres below. Ojen liqueur Ojén is famous for the production of Aguardiente de Ojén (es), or simply \\"ojen\\" (\\"OH-hen\\") as it is known in English, an anise liqueur that once played a major part in the town's economy. This liqueur, nowadays locally produced by the distillery company Dominique Mertens Impex. S.L.,Dominique Mertens Impex.

The character is loosely based on the Archie Comics character, The Comet. Fictional character biography The Comet's story is narrated, first-person, by the character himself in the past tense. In the beginning, he is an ordinary human named Rob Connors, whose only real ambition in life is to play professional baseball. His ambition is somewhat stilted by his parents, who are scientists living in arctic areas. Rob returns to his parents' home one day to find it torn apart by some kind of battle, which to all appearances took places weeks ago: our first sign of a strange continuity clash, since Rob had been gone only a matter of hours. In an attempt to call for help, Rob is forced to climb up the radio mast to fix it. It collapses under his weight, and he is pinned beneath it, unable to free himself until a sudden surge of energy sends him soaring through the air. Assuming his powers to be the result of an electric shock from the mast, Rob learns he can fly and generate energy beams from his hands - one of which inadvertently sets off an explosion. He returns to his girlfriend, a news reporter, who reprimands him for not speaking to her for months, even though Rob wrote to her every week. He reveals his powers to her, and she suggests he don a costume and become a superhero, since he left a red energy trail behind when he flew, he assumed the guise of The Comet. In his numerous battles as the Comet, Rob slowly learns to use his powers. He can fly, generate heat beams and force blasts, create a limited forcefield, and even breathe underwater by using his powers to force the water away: he hypothesizes that this traps a bubble of air between him and the water. The Comet is also stronger than a normal human, and considerably tougher, though not invulnerable: shrapnel from a grenade does his arm some damage. Eventually, Rob learns that his powers are the result of his mind being accidentally transferred into the body of shape-shifting aliens that were researching the Earth, disguised as the Connors family. This is the reason for the discontinuity in Rob's memory compared to actual events. He attempts to force the other aliens to free his parents, but fails: they leave, never to return. The hits keep coming, as Rob's original human body is killed by one of the Comet's enemies, in circumstances that make it look like the Comet was responsible. He goes to his girlfriend for help, only to discover that she knew all along, and was in fact the one who sent the aliens to the Connors. In attempting to reveal this story on the news, she breaks the bargain she made with the aliens, and the last of them on the planet kills her. The police attempt to arrest the Comet for the murder of Rob Connors. Rob tries to unmask himself to prove himself blameless, but accidentally accesses his alien shapeshifting ability in his desire to show his face, and morphs into a one- eyed alien monster. Horrified, Rob tears away from the scene, and is apparently killed in an explosion. We learn later, in The Crucible, that he didn't die, but resumed human form and became a baseball player named Jay Cole with no memory of his earlier life. His true identity is revealed by The Black Hood, and they team up for a while. However, the Tomorrow Men, a group of time-manipulating businessmen, make it look like the Hood was intending to betray the Comet, and in insane rage, the Comet irradiates an entire city. The city is covered over with an immense dome, but the Comet breaks free, intending to kill Jordan, the world's greatest authority on energy control, whom he believes is a threat to him. His attack is foiled by one of the Tomorrow Men, who captures the Comet, intending to steal his energy to power the Tomorrow Men's base. The Comet breaks free, but is sent back to Earth, where the Black Hood is forced, regretfully, to kill him. Powers and abilities Comet had the ability to manipulate photonic energy to fire blasts of force, heat, blinding light, and laser beams. He could fly at supersonic speeds, leaving a red energy trail behind him. He could also generate a protective halo of light that could deflect most physical attacks, but could not protect him from heat based attacks (when a robot used a flame thrower on him, his used his halo to block the attack, but he still got mildly burned). He could also shapeshift and was stronger than a normal human.

The Berca Mud Volcanoes (Vulcanii Noroioși de la Pâclele Mici) is a geological and botanical reservation located in Scorțoasa commune close to Berca in Buzău County in Romania. Its most spectacular feature is the mud volcanoes, small volcano-shaped structures typically a few metres high caused by the eruption of mud and natural gases. The geological phenomenon The surrounding landscape formed by the dried off volcanic mud As the gases erupt from 3000 metres deep towards the surface, through the underground layers of clay and water, they push up underground salty water and mud, so that they overflow through the mouths of the volcanoes, while the gas emerges as bubbles. The mud dries off at the surface, creating a relatively solid conical structure resembling a real volcano. The mud expelled by them is cold, as it comes from inside the Earth's continental crust layers, and not from the mantle. The reservation is unique in Romania. Elsewhere in Europe, similar phenomena can be observed in Italy (northern Apennines and Sicily), Ukraine (in the Kerch Peninsula), Russia (in the Taman Peninsula) as well as Azerbaijan. Gases There are several sites (the main tourist sites being Pâclele Mari and Pâclele Mici), and gas analysis shows that the composition varies from site to site, but is mainly methane, with approximately 2% carbon dioxide, and 2-15% nitrogen. More details are given in Etiope et al. Flora The mud volcanoes create a strange lunar landscape, due to the absence of vegetation around the cones. Vegetation is scarce because the soil is very salty, an environmental condition in which few plants can survive. However, this kind of environment is good for some rare species of plants, such as Nitraria schoberi and Obione verrucifera. Tourism The phenomenon can be observed on two separate locations near the Berca commune, dubbed the Little Mud Volcanoes and The Big Mud Volcanoes. The volcanoes themselves are surrounded by 'badlands' of water- cut ravines. Admission fees are charged (4 RON/adult in 2017) and (since you're walking on a crust of dried mud that is not entirely solid yet) access is only permitted on dry days to prevent destruction of the unique environment.

It is commonly known as PW or P-Dub. It is located on Mod Quad, between North Dining Hall and its twin dorm Pasquerilla East Hall.  History  Pasquerilla West Hall was built in 1981 as a gift from Frank J. and Sylvia Pasquerilla to their daughter. Their donation was the largest in the school's history by a living person. Initially, he wanted his gift to the university to be anonymous, but Fr. Theodore Hesburgh convinced him to disclose his name since it might attract other donors. Pasquerilla West Frank J Pasquerilla was an entrepreneur of Italian descent from Johnstown, Pennsylvania. He was the president in 1953 and eventually sole owner in 1961 of Crown American construction company, and later invested in shopping malls and hotels Frank Pasquerilla was a philanthropist for many cultural institutions in the Johnstown areas such as the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown and for many Catholic colleges, including Georgetown University and St. Francis College and was Knight Commander of the Order of St. Gregory the Great. The current rectress is Emily Orsini, who graduated from Lourdes University with a Bachelor's degree in Interdisciplinary Studies and the University of Toledo with a Master's degree in Higher Education. Features Pasquerilla West was the first dorm that was built to house women from the very beginning together with its twin Pasquerilla East. Originally, the two dorms were planned to have a shared chapel, but the idea was scrapped and the chapel in the hall was carved out of a common area. It was also the first dorm to be equipped with air conditioning. Its inhabitants are known as \\"Purple Weasels\\", but before the 1990s they were known as \\"Plaid Wave\\" or the \\"Pink Wizards\\". The chapel is dedicated to Saint Clare of Assisi, and an entire wall of stained glass depicting the Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi in Assisi, Italy was completed in 1998. Traditions  Pasquerilla West's signature event is called Queen Week. Every section of PW participates in a number of events and at the end of the week, a freshman in the winning section becomes the queen of the dorm. Another event PW has is PDub's Closet. Every fall, members of the dorm collect gently used clothes from across campus, and students who donate can choose to get some new-to-you clothing items or win some raffle prizes. All proceeds and unexchanged clothes, along with all winter coats, are donated to the local homeless shelter. PDub’s carnation sale is the longest standing tradition in the dorm. During the week of Valentine’s Day, ND students are able to purchase carnations to be delivered to anyone on campus’s door. All proceeds go to St. Margaret’s House. Women's Empowerment Week, the newest signature event, is held throughout a week in March to celebrate and empower women across campus.

Cartoons, released in 1963. Production returned to Hollywood after five years (the previous 13 shorts were produced in Czechoslovakia and directed by Gene Deitch). Plot Tom is relaxing in a penthouse, while Jerry is struggling to look for food, being forced to tie his tail around his waist to stop his stomach growling. Suddenly Jerry sees a lunchbox at a 125-story skyscraper construction site and jumps into it, eating through to it. However, the steel beam on which the lunchbox is sitting is lifted into the air and the box slides off. Jerry tries to hide in the lunchbox, but it bursts open. The lunchbox then falls onto Tom's head, much to Tom's annoyance, but Tom sees Jerry falling and catches him in a baseball glove in between two pieces of bread. Tom eats the sandwich, but notices he missed eating Jerry. Tom eats the rest of the sandwich, but Jerry escapes by flicking Tom's middle finger into his eye. Jerry jumps into a rain gutter, but unaware slides back onto the construction site, barely managing to evade a crusher. Jerry jumps into Tom's mouth and closes his ears and eyes, but Tom shakes Jerry out. Tom grabs a flyswatter and flattens Jerry four times, but Jerry angrily stops him. He marches towards Tom and holds out his hand as if to say, \\"Hand over the flyswatter.\\" And then he flattens Tom's head to escape. Jerry runs to the end of a flagpole, with Tom following, but Jerry spins the pole counterclockwise. Tom, running very fast, convinces Jerry to stop. He momentarily sports a halo and points at it as to say \\"I'm too young to die\\", but Jerry lets Tom know that he loves him before unscrewing the ball. Tom thinks that Jerry is crazy, but the cat and the flagpole are sent down to the construction site as Jerry, still standing on the ball in mid air, rolls back to the penthouse. Tom eventually ends up rolling on a barrel and encounters the same crusher that almost killed Jerry. He too evades the crusher and is relieved for a moment, but soon afterwards rolls into a humongous building hosting a big dog show before the dogs quickly attack Tom. Finally, Jerry relaxes in Tom's penthouse and drinks some juice but ends up swallowing a whole ice cube before he decides to take a nap.

Finding the local bass fishing guides too expensive, Decker takes Ott's advice and meets a reclusive hermit who lives in the woods, calling himself \\"Skink\\". While teaching Decker about fishing, he mentions seeing Clinch on the lake, but not fishing, on the morning he died. Attending Clinch's funeral, Decker meets Gault's sister Elaine, or \\"Lanie,\\" who confides to Decker that she and Clinch were lovers. She tells Decker that Gault hired Clinch to catch Lockhart first, only she believes Lockhart had Clinch killed. Ott is skeptical of Lanie's suspicions, since the coroner ruled Clinch's death an accident and a murder over fishing is too outlandish to be believed. However, when Ott interviews Clinch's widow, he also discovers clues that Clinch wasn't fishing. Tracking down the junked remains of Clinch's boat, Ott discovers signs of sabotage. Unfortunately, at that moment Ott is tracked down and murdered. After finding the body, Decker and Skink are both committed to nailing Lockhart. They tail him to his latest fishing tournament on Louisiana's Lake Maurepas, but inadvertently photograph the wrong gang of cheaters; Lockhart wins the tournament anyway. Skink tries to raise Decker's spirits, adding, \\"Worse comes to worst, I'll just shoot the fucker.\\" Later, Decker returns to their hotel room and finds Lanie waiting for him. After the two sleep together and he drops her off at her hotel, Decker notices lights on at the lakeside. He discovers Lockhart floating in the weigh tank, clubbed to death. Assuming Skink is the culprit, Decker drives back to Florida. Upon returning home, he finds the Miami police, led by Detective Al Garcia, waiting for him. Skink intercepts Decker and tells him Gault's whole assignment was a set-up, allowing Gault to kill his hated rival and put the blame on Decker. The Outdoor Christian Network, led by televangelist Charlie Weeb, organizes a fishing tournament in Lockhart's memory to promote Weeb's housing development at the edge of the Everglades. Weeb is becoming increasingly desperate to boost sales of the condominia, as his network is so financially dependent on the development that its failure will also ruin Weeb himself. He becomes even more desperate when the bass salted into the condo's lakes die, revealing that the water is toxic. Weeb orders his new spokesman, Eddie Spurling, to cheat by harvesting caged bass from the neighboring stretch of clean water in the Everglades. While trying to escape Miami, Decker and Skink are stopped by Garcia, who has already found holes in Gault's frame-up story and is more than ready to believe Decker's version of events. Meanwhile, a worried Gault sends his hired thug, Thomas Curl, to kill Decker before Garcia finds him. While researching Lockhart's history, Decker and Skink learn of the housing development, and Skink is determined to stop it by sabotaging the fishing tournament. With the help of Skink's friend, State Trooper Jim Tile, Decker tracks down Lanie and forces her to confess to helping her brother frame Decker for Lockhart's murder. Lanie admits that she became involved with Decker at Gault's suggestion, to help punish Lockhart for Clinch's murder. After Lockhart was killed, Gault convinced her to falsely tell police that Decker was on his way to see Lockhart when she last saw him. Although Lanie's recorded statement is enough to clear Decker's name, Curl kidnaps Decker's ex- wife Catherine and demands that Decker trade his life for hers. Decker tells Skink to go ahead with his plan to sabotage the tournament while he deals with Curl himself. Skink's original plan is to have Garcia and Tile enter the tournament, posing as brothers, and win by catching Skink's gargantuan Queenie. With publicity for Weeb's development aimed exclusively at white people, Skink predicts that having an African-American and a Cuban win the tournament will be fatal for sales. However, at the last moment, Skink changes his plan and arranges a \\"confrontation\\" between Queenie and Gault. He anonymously tips off Gault as to the location where he will plant Queenie, while sabotaging the motor of Garcia and Tile's boat. Decker rescues Catherine and kills Curl with a booby-trapped camera. Predictably, the tournament is a fiasco: the latest batch of fish are so sickened by the toxic water that they refuse to eat, while Garcia and Tile are the only participants to catch one (tiny) bass. Spurling refuses to cheat, forcing Weeb to name them the winners and admit that the promised $250,000 grand prize is \\"not available.\\" Garcia and Tile reveal their badges and arrest Weeb for fraud on live television. Skink sees all the bass floating to the surface and realizes he has put Queenie in mortal danger by slipping her into the toxic water. Decker and Catherine join him on a boat borrowed from Spurling, and they speed to where he put her into the water. They come upon Gault's boat, where Lanie is sitting alone and Gault's dead body is floating in the water. Gault succeeded in hooking Queenie, but was unprepared for her weight and power, and so tried to use his boat's engine to exhaust her. When she unexpectedly changed direction, Gault was unwilling to let her go, and was pulled overboard onto his own boat's propeller. Skink dives into the water, pulls a barely-alive Queenie out and leaps across a levee to put her in the Everglades. Decker and Catherine, following onto the levee, cannot see either of them, but are sure they hear the sound of both swimming to safety.

Plot The shuttle camera on a United States spaceship orbiting Earth begins to malfunction and the astronauts on board shut it off. Back on Earth, there are two technicians working on the shuttle after it has landed; one of the technicians, Crew Chief Simmons, detaches the camera and takes it to be repaired. However, after touching it, a blue light flashes and he suddenly disappears. The box falls to the ground and another technician calls for the emergency alert, and the box is put in an isolation chamber. As the scientists are discussing what could possibly have happened to the technician, there is a bright flash in the isolation chamber and Simmons reappears; the box, however, is mysteriously missing. Simmons asks to be let out and becomes irritated when his pleas go unanswered. The scientists review the surveillance tape of the box changing into the man but are stumped as to what could have caused the transformation. Though the technicians are suspicious, Simmons is able to tell them his name, identification number, and can give them personal information. After it becomes clear that he will not be released, Simmons disappears in another flash of light, and replacing him is a woman who begs them to let her out. One of the technicians claims that it is Simmons' wife Kathy. After realizing that Simmons may be a creature of unknown origin, they come to the conclusion that it can shape-change at will. After being foiled by a lapse in judgement, the creature becomes flustered and tries to cover up its mistake. The blue light flashes again and Simmons reappears only to start breaking the interior of the isolation tank. In response, the scientists and technicians subdue him with sleeping gas. Dr. Vaughn Heilman attempts to enter the chamber, but is surprised to find that Simmons is still awake and takes his hand. They both disappear in a flash of blue light and they are replaced by a nuclear bomb. The technicians and scientists suddenly recall that Dr. Heilman was once a bomb expert for the United States nuclear team. Dr. Curt Lockridge attempts to reason with the creature, saying that it will probably survive the explosion but those in the complex will not. When the timer reaches zero, Heilman appears again and runs through the open door with Lockridge at his heels. Heilman is confronted at a launch platform and Lockridge begs to let the doctor and Simmons free. The creature claims that they are not prisoners, and stay within him due to their thirst for knowledge. The creature asks Lockridge to come with them, to join them in the adventure, but Lockridge declines. He then asks why the creature came to earth, and it replies that it arrived on Earth out of curiosity before changing into a glowing gaseous cloud that flies away into the night sky.

He played as a catcher in professional baseball for 26 seasons between 1911 and 1937, including nine seasons in Major League Baseball with the Cleveland Naps in 1913 and 1914 and the Detroit Tigers from 1921 to 1927. Bassler had a career batting average of .304 and an on-base percentage of .416 in his nine major league seasons. His on-base percentage ranks as the second highest in major league history for a catcher. His .346 batting average in 1924 was the highest by a catcher to that point in American League history and the highest by any major league catcher since 1912. He finished in the top seven in the voting for the American League Most Valuable Player award three straight years: sixth in 1922, seventh in 1923, and fifth in 1924. Baseball historian, Bill James, ranked Bassler 47th all- time among major league catchers in his book, The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract. Bassler also played 15 seasons in the Pacific Coast League (PCL) with the Los Angeles Angels (1915–1917, 1919), Seattle Rainiers (1920), Hollywood Stars (1928–1935), and Seattle Indians (1936–1937). He appeared in 1,525 games in the PCL, compiling a .321 batting average in those games. In 1943, he was one of the inaugural inductees into the Pacific Coast League Hall of Fame. After his playing career ended, Bassler lived in Southern California. Early life Bassler was born in 1895 in Mechanics Grove, Pennsylvania. He was one of 13 children born to a Mennonite family in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. His father Jacob Bassler (born 1866) was a Pennsylvania native who worked in a paper mill in 1900 and as a motorman on a street car in 1910. His mother Fianna Bassler (born 1868) was also a Pennsylvania native.Census entry for Jacob Bassler and family. Son John born June 1895.

Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations Inc, 2010. Professional baseball =Minor leagues= Bassler began playing professional baseball in 1911 at age 15 for Sunbury in the Susquehanna League. He next played in 1912 for the York White Roses in the Tri-State League. =Cleveland Naps= Johnny Bassler, 1913 After completing the 1912 season in the Tri-State League, Bassler traveled to California to play winter league baseball. There he played on the same team as Cleveland Naps shortstop, Ivy Olson. Olson persuaded Bassler to join the Naps for spring training camp in 1913. Bassler made his major league debut for the Cleveland Naps on July 11, 1913, one month after his 18th birthday. He appeared in only one game for the Naps in 1913 – going hitless in two plate appearances and committing an error. In 1914, Bassler played in 43 games, 18 as the Naps' starting catcher. Though he compiled a .182 batting average he drew 15 bases on balls in 94 plate appearances to boost his on-base percentage to .323. =Pacific Coast League= Bassler returned to West Coast and played for the Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League from 1915 to 1917 and again in 1919. He missed the 1918 season due to military service during the United States' participation in World War I. =Detroit Tigers= 1921 season In January 1921, the Los Angeles Angels traded Bassler to the Detroit Tigers in exchange for Oscar Stanage, two infielders and a pitcher. The Tigers made the deal on the recommendation of Ty Cobb. He remained with the Tigers for seven years. In 1921, his first season with the Tigers, Bassler appeared in 119 games, including 111 as the team's starting catcher. He compiled a .307 batting average. He also drew 58 bases on balls for a .401 on-base percentage. He also ranked among the American League's leading catchers with a 5.11 range factor rating per nine innings (first), 433 putouts (fifth), 113 assists (fourth), and a .975 fielding percentage (fifth). After the 1921 season, Cobb opined that Bassler was smart, diagnosed plays quickly, and had a good arm, and predicted that Bassler would be the premier catcher in the American League in 1922. The entire Detroit lineup hit remarkably well in 1921. Harry Heilmann and Ty Cobb finished first and second in batting average, and the team finished the season with a batting average of .316, the highest in American League history and second highest in major league history. However, true to the baseball adage that good pitching beats good hitting, the 1921 Tigers lacked good pitching and finished in sixth place, 27 games behind the pennant-winning Yankees. 1922 season In 1922, Basser appeared in 121 games, 113 as the Tigers' starting catcher. He compiled a .323 batting average, and his .422 on-base percentage was seventh best in the American League. He also ranked among the league leaders with a 31.0 at bats to strikeout ratio (eighth). Defensively, he continued to rank among the league's leading catchers with 12 double plays turned (fourth), a 4.53 range factor rating per game, 113 assists (fifth), and a .980 fielding percentage (fifth). However, he also led the league with 73 stolen bases allowed and ranked third with 11 errors. He ranked sixth in the voting for the 1922 American League Most Valuable Player award. 1923 season In 1923, Bassler appeared in a career-high 135 games, 121 as the starting catcher, and compiled a .298 batting average. Offensively, he ranked among the American League leaders with a .414 on-base percentage (eighth), 76 bases on balls (ninth), and 29.5 at bats per strikeout. Defensively, he led the league's catchers with 84 runners caught stealing and a 59.6% success rating in catching base runners trying to steal a base. He ranked second in the league with a .988 fielding percentage and 133 assists and ranked fifth with a career-high 447 putouts. He ranked seventh in the voting for the 1923 American League Most Valuable Player award. Between the 1923 and 1924 seasons, Harry Bullion of the Detroit Free Press wrote that Bassler, like Cobb, was a student of the game. During the 1923 season, Bassler was part of one of the great trick plays in baseball history. When Babe Ruth came to bat, player-manager Ty Cobb whistled a signal to Bassler and pitcher Hooks Dauss from center field, directing them to give Ruth an intentional walk. When Dauss threw a strike past Ruth, Cobb ran to the infield, yelling at Dauss and Bassler for disobeying his order. When Dauss then threw a second strike past Ruth, Cobb raced in again, stomped around and pulled both Dauss and Bassler from the game. After warming up, the relief pitcher fired a third strike past an unsuspecting Ruth. Cobb reportedly doubled up in laughter, calling it a \\"once in a lifetime setup play.\\" 1924 season Bassler had his best season in 1924. In his fourth season as the Tigers' starting catcher, he appeared in 122 games, including 116 as a starter at catcher. He compiled a career-high .346 batting average that was the fifth highest in the American League and a .441 on-base percentage that was the second highest in the league trailing only Babe Ruth. Bassler's .346 batting average in 1924 was the highest by a catcher to that point in American League history. It was also the highest by any major league catcher since Chief Meyers hit .358 in 1912. Playing at a position where the emphasis was on defense rather than offense, Bassler was the leading batter on a 1924 Detroit team that included four Hall of Famers and American League batting champions: Ty Cobb (12 batting titles), Harry Heilmann (four batting titles), Heinie Manush (1926 batting title), and Charlie Gehringer (1937 batting title). He also had another strong defensive season, ranking among the league's leading catchers with 103 assists (third), 11 double plays turned (third), a .979 fielding percentage (fourth), and 402 putouts (fifth). In the voting for the 1924 American League MVP, he finished fifth behind pitchers Walter Johnson and Herb Pennock, second baseman Eddie Collins, and outfielder Charlie Jamieson. Bassler later credited his improved batting in 1924 to his teammate Bobby Veach. Bassler recalled: > \\"I was a dead left-field hitter and all a good pitcher had to do was shoot > me a fast high ball, inside, and I'd pop up. I found Veach used a little > fuller swing than I against this delivery, always keeping his wrist behind > the point of contact with the ball. About the middle of 1924, after > experimenting, I landed upon the combination of a big-handled bat of light > Cuban wood and a full swing patterned after Veach. Then suddenly they began > to line into right and center for me.\\" 1925 to 1927 seasons In 1925, Bassler remained the Tigers' primary catcher, but his batting average dropped 67 points from .346 to .279. In 1926, he shared the catcher position with Clyde Manion and Larry Woodall, with Bassler and Manion each starting 57 games and Woodall 41. He again shared the job with Woodall starting 70 games at catcher and Bassler starting 59 games. Bassler compiled batting averages of .305 and .285 in 1926 and 1927. He appeared in his final major league game on September 30, 1927, at age 32. =Career accomplishments= Detroit Tigers, 1921 (left to right): Johnny Bassler, Donie Bush, Bobby Veach, Bert Cole, Dutch Leonard, Hooks Dauss Bassler was a capable player both on offense and defense. His notable career accomplishments include the following: * Bassler finished in the top seven in the American League Most Valuable Player voting three straight years: sixth in 1922, seventh in 1923, and fifth in 1924. * Bassler's .346 batting average in 1924 was the highest by a catcher to that point in American League history and the highest by any major league catcher since 1912. His 1924 average led a Detroit team that included Hall of Fame batsmen Ty Cobb, Harry Heilmann, Heinie Manush, and Charlie Gehringer. * Bassler compiled a .416 on-base percentage over the course of his career. He had an on-base percentage over .400 in all seven years he played for the Tigers. The only major league catcher with a higher career on-base percentage is Mickey Cochrane at .419. Bassler's 1924 on-base percentage of .441 was second behind Babe Ruth. His .406 on-base percentage in his years with the Tigers ranks third in franchise history, behind Ty Cobb and Hank Greenberg. * Bassler had a good batting eye. He walked 437 times in his major league career, while striking out only 81 times. That is a ratio of 5.4 walks per strikeout – one of the highest in major league history. The only two American League players known to have a higher walk per strikeout ratio are Joe Sewell and Tris Speaker. * Bassler was also among the American League leaders in at bats per strikeout four straight years from 1922 to 1925. His 1925 total of 57.3 at bats per strikeout was a career high. In The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, released in 2001, baseball analyst Bill James rated Bassler as the 47th best catcher of all time. James wrote that, \\"if his major league career wasn't so short he would rank among the top 20 catchers of all time.\\" Bassler was also a solid defensive catcher in his years with the Detroit Tigers. In 1923, his .988 fielding percentage (eight errors in 128 games) was twelve points higher than the league average of .975. Bassler was known for his strong throwing arm. In his prime years from 1921 to 1925, Bassler had 462 assists in 482 games. In 1923, he had 133 assists in 128 games as a catcher. He also had 14 double plays in 118 games in 1925. The weakest area of Bassler's game was power. In 2,319 career at bats, Bassler hit one home run. =Return to the Pacific Coast League= In 1928, the Tigers sold the 32-year-old Bassler to the Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League (PCL). Bassler played for the Stars from 1928 to 1935 and appeared in 867 games for the club. In 1930, he hit .365 and led the Stars to the PCL pennant. He hit .354 in 1931 and .336 in 1933. According to Bill James, \\"the PCL didn't record walks, but it would be a safe guess that he wasn't walking any less often.\\" In his book, The Hollywood Stars, Richard E. Beverage wrote that Bassler was \\"one of the greatest catchers in minor league history.\\" On March 30, 1935, Bassler collapsed with what was originally reported to be a stomach hemorrhage while in the dugout during a spring game for the Stars against the Chicago Cubs. His diagnosis was later reported as a heart attack, and he announced his retirement from baseball in the summer of 1935. Bassler made a comeback with the Seattle Indians of the PCL in 1936. He compiled a .354 batting average in 111 games and 260 at bats during the 1936 season. On May 25, 1937, he was hired as the manager of the Seattle club. He also appeared in 56 games as a player for Seattle in 1937, compiling a .313 batting average. Bill Klepper, the Seattle team owner, had financial problems. On the last day of the 1937 season, pitcher Dick Barrett needed two victories to reach 20 and earn a $500 bonus. He beat Sacramento 4–1 in the first game of a doubleheader. Between games, federal and state tax agents seized the gate receipts for money due on admission taxes. Klepper told Bassler to pitch Marion Oppelt in the second game. Bassler started Barrett anyway. Barrett went all the way and got his 20th win, 11–2. The next morning, September 20, 1937, Klepper fired Bassler for insubordination. Over the course of 15 seasons, Bassler appeared in 1,525 games in the PCL, compiled .321 batting average with 1,353 hits, 533 runs scored, and 198 doubles. In 1943, he was one of the inaugural inductees into the Pacific Coast League Hall of Fame. =Major league coach= On November 28, 1937, Bassler was hired as a coach and chief assistant to newly hired Cleveland Indians manager Ossie Vitt, a former Detroit teammate of Bassler. Bassler remained with Cleveland from 1938 to 1940. He has been credited with helping Bob Feller, who had won no more than nine games in his first two major league seasons. In three years working with Bassler, Feller won 68 games and led the American League in wins and strikeouts in both 1939 and 1940. During the 1940 season, Bassler was the second in command under Vitt. Vitt was a tough man to get along with and became embroiled in a player revolt by the 1940 team that became known as the \\"Cleveland Crybabies.\\" In his autobiography, Feller wrote that the players decided to stop dealing with Vitt and work instead with Bassler. \\"We decided to go around Vitt. We worked with his coaches, mostly with his number two man, Johnny Bassler. We were doing what people in a lot of organizations with management problems do: ignore the top guy and work with the second in command.\\" On December 7, 1940, Bassler was hired as a coach for the St. Louis Browns and was given the responsibility of working with the pitchers. He was released by the Browns on June 6, 1941, after spending less than one season with the club. Family and later years Bassler was married to Margaret Bassler. They had four children, Barbara (born c. 1922), Sally (born c. 1925), John (born c. 1929), and James (born 1933).Census entry for John Bassler, professional baseball player living at 245 Euclid Street in Santa Monica.

After retiring from baseball, and during the offseason during his years in baseball, Bassler spent much of his time hooking rugs. Bassler would take old silk stockings and dye them in pots on the stove. He would then cut them in strips and hook them into silk rugs. In the 1940s, Bassler bought in Latigo Canyon in Malibu for $75 an acre; he drove to the property on weekends and planted plants. He also built a house on the property, using discarded tile from a Malibu tile company and wood from the demolition of the Venice Pier. Bassler also collected materials from his job at the Twentieth Century Fox movie lot in Century City. According to his son, the studio job was \\"mainly to get building supplies.\\" After a project, the sets would be torn down and burned. Bassler saw an opportunity to obtain materials from discarded sets to help build his house in Latigo Canyon. Bassler's son joked that their house went up bit by bit with pieces from Hollywood sets, including the front door from a Gene Tierney film Leave Her to Heaven, and the back of the house (in Chinese style) from Gregory Peck's The Keys of the Kingdom. Bassler coached Bob Feller before he entered the military during World War II, and the two became friends. When Feller got out of the military, Bassler took him on a tour of the studio. Alfred Hitchcock knew of Feller and let him sit in on the shooting of the film Lifeboat. Bassler died in 1979 in Santa Monica at age 84. He was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in Santa Monica.

The site and remaining buildings are preserved as Fort Simcoe Historical State Park, located eight miles (13 km) west of modern White Swan, Washington, in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains. History The site was a school for tribes of Indigenous peoples of the Americas from areas all around the present state of Washington. Prior to 1850, the site was used as a school where Native American children taken from their families were forced to cease practicing traditional customs and speak English, a specific practice in ethnocide. Punishment for non-compliant children included imprisonment in a small jail. The fort was built in the late 1850s in an old oak grove watered by natural springs by future Civil War general Robert S. Garnett. The fort was in use for three years. The park was established in 1956. The fort was built in the middle of the Yakima Valley and the Yakama Tribe's traditional fishing areas. This prime location allowed soldiers of the new commander to keep an eye out for visitors to the tribe and basically keep an eye on the tribe. The relations of the White soldiers and tribes can serve as a dark time in US government relations. Fort Simcoe can be labeled as a program of an act of cultural genocide. Fort Simcoe is viewed this way because the U.S. government decided to merge 14 different tribes and to teach them American culture. The tribes were to learn famous Americans and given Christian/American names. In 1922, the U.S. government decided to move the Indian agency from Fort Simcoe to Toppenish which triggered extreme emotions of past feelings of relocations for generations of the original tribes. The location of the fort also provided easy trading routes established by waterway or railroad. Seeing that the fort is United States government property, a certain architect designed and constructed the fort, Louis Scholl. Fort Simcoe is similar to the design of Fort Dalles where there are blockhouses at each corners but no stockade allowing barracks to define the fortification. James Harvey Wilbur and Captain Frederick Dent took of the challenge of creating a road passage to Fort Simcoe. They said, \\"the fort's location also fits perfectly with the army strategic goal to carve out a road system that connected California with Washington Territory\\". This quote demonstrates the determination to get to Fort Simcoe and how naturally it can be easy to get there but it is all based around strategic movements by the government. Park and museum Fort Simcoe Historical State Park is a , day-use heritage park on the Yakama Indian Reservation. The park is primarily an interpretive effort, telling the story of mid-19th-century army life and providing insights into the lifeways of local Native Americans. Five original buildings are still standing at the fort: the commander's house, three captain's houses, and a blockhouse. Various other buildings have been recreated to appear original. Houses are filled with period furnishings. The park was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The interpretive center, the original commander's house and two officer's buildings with period furnishings open to the public from April through September on Wednesday through Sunday. The original blockhouse and other recreated fort buildings are not open to the public. Special re- enactments and living history events are held during the year, as well as other special events.

The law came into effect on 22 January 2003 when it was published in the Government Gazette of South Africa number 28075. Scope RICA regulates the interception of communications, the monitoring of radio signals and radio frequency spectrums and the provision of communication-related information - information relating to indirect communication in the records of telecommunication service providers. It also regulates applications for interception of communications and provision of communication-related information under certain circumstances. It regulates law enforcement where interception of communications is involved and prohibits the provision of telecommunication services which do not have the capability to be intercepted and requires telecommunication service providers to store communication-related information (CRI). The law specifies costs to be borne by telecommunication service providers related to these requirements and compensation to services providers. It provides for the establishment of interception centres an Office for Interception Centres and an Internet Service Providers Assistance Fund. Lastly it prohibits the manufacturing, assembling, possessing, selling, purchasing or advertising of interception equipment without a certificate of exemption issued by the relevant Minister. Structure RICA is not limited to the provisions contained in the Act itself, but is supplemented by a directive, a notice, a schedule and four proclamations. The directive prescribed the technical and security requirements related to the interception and routing of communications and the recordal and storage of CRI. Schedule A of the Directive applies to fixed line telecommunications operators and Schedule B and C applies to mobile cellular providers and Internet service providers respectively. The various types of listed equipment is detailed in the notice while the Schedule lists serious crimes that justify interception. Finally the four proclamations deal with the enforcement dates of the Act. Since its promulgation RICA has been amended four times. Two of these amendments are already in force and two are pending. Constitutional Conflict Section 14 of the Bill of Rights in the South African Constitution of 1996The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa expressly provides that \\"everyone has a right to privacy, which includes the right not to have (...) (d) the privacy of their communications infringed\\". The rights in the Bill of Rights may be limited, section 36 of the Constitution. However, various other provisions in the Bill of Rights indirectly imply a right to safety and security. If citizens have a right to security, it creates a corresponding duty on the State. Chapter 11 of the Constitution governs this duty and authorise the Police, Defence Force and Intelligence Agencies to assist the State in its security obligations. Parliament therefore attempted to balance these two conflicting rights by providing for judicial oversight and limiting interception only to those cases where a serious crime is involved. Duties and Prohibitions RICA provides for three main types of provisions - duties, prohibitions and procedures. The duties are directed at enabling interception, while the prohibitions are aimed at enforcing the individuals privacy right. Equality It is, however, neither privacy nor security that raise the most objections against RICA, but equality concerns. A recent proposed amendment to section 40 provides for preferential treatment of mobile providers by extending the enforcement of cell phone registration indefinitely. Technological neutrality Different communications tools and technologies are also not subject to equal treatment in RICA. An email, for example is not subject to the onerous duty that related data (like the time, date, sender and recipient of the email) should be recorded and stored while such duties apply to all telephone and cellular communications.

The school was named after Saint Francis of Assisi and Saint Francis de Sales, and is operated by an independent corporation that is a partnership between the Salesian Society and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Monterey. History and Early Development The origins of Saint Francis School go back to 1869. In that year the Catholic Diocese of Monterey-Los Angeles opened a boys' orphanage in the Pajaro Valley, on the outskirts of the farming community of Watsonville. The orphanage was placed under the patronage of the Virgin Mary as the Immaculate Conception. In 1871, a group of Franciscans (Order of Friars Minor) from Germany assumed responsibility for the orphanage. Originally Saint Francis School and the Immaculate Conception Orphanage were set off on the northern side Hecker Pass Road and overlooked excellent farm land. As the program grew, the friars developed the agricultural program as a way to support the orphanage and the school. The presence of the school also attracted the support of local farmers, many of whom were Catholic immigrants from Ireland, Italy and Croatia. As farm families looked to St Francis as the local spiritual center (the parish church was several miles away), the Franciscan friars opened the school chapel for Sunday Services and daily Masses. The school chapel, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, became known simply as the 'Valley Church'. The Franciscan friars remained at Saint Francis School through the remainder of the 19th century, enlarging the plant, developing the farm, and serving hundreds of needy boys. At the beginning of the 20th century, the friars launched a building program. It was time to move out of the wooden dwellings and build a modern plant. The friars planned to build a whole new style of residential program for the boys, with twelve group homes to be built on three sides of a central plaza, and a school building, dining facilities, and a new Valley Church on the fourth side. The building program was launched in 1913. Unfortunately, one year later World War I broke out in Europe. The fact that the Franciscan Community in the Pajaro Valley was largely made up of Germans created difficulties in the minds of local businessmen. The contractor that the friars had hired, a German- American, was boycotted by those in building supplies. As a result, he could only procure inferior materials for the building of the new school and residences. In 1995 a movement for a new Catholic high school in the Diocese of Monterey took off with the support of Bishop Sylvester Ryan and the Salesians of Don Bosco. From 1998 to 2001, funds were raised, plans made, students recruited, teachers hired, and construction begun. In 2001, the school opened with 35 freshmen and sophomores at a temporary location in Santa Cruz. Students, teachers, staff members, and administrators commuted to Holy Cross Parish Hall for classes, while construction was underway on the new classrooms being built at the Watsonville site. During the summer months the school moved from Santa Cruz into the present facilities. The dedication service was held on August 25, 2002, and classes started the next day.

It is possible to derive an evaluation order or the absence of an evaluation order that respects the given dependencies from the dependency graph.  Definition  right Given a set of objects S and a transitive relation R \\\\subseteq S \\\\times S with (a,b) \\\\in R modeling a dependency \\"a depends on b\\" (\\"a needs b evaluated first\\"), the dependency graph is a graph G = (S, T) with T \\\\subseteq R and T being the transitive reduction of R. For example, assume a simple calculator. This calculator supports assignment of constant values to variables and assigning the sum of exactly two variables to a third variable. Given several equations like \\"A = B+C; B = 5+D; C=4; D=2;\\", then S=\\\\\\\\{A,B,C,D\\\\\\\\} and R=\\\\\\\\{(A,B),(A,C),(B,D)\\\\\\\\}. You can derive this relation directly: A depends on B and C, because you can add two variables if and only if you know the values of both variables. Thus, B must be calculated before A can be calculated. However, the values of C and D are known immediately, because they are number literals.  Recognizing impossible evaluations  In a dependency graph, the cycles of dependencies (also called circular dependencies) lead to a situation in which no valid evaluation order exists, because none of the objects in the cycle may be evaluated first. If a dependency graph does not have any circular dependencies, it forms a directed acyclic graph, and an evaluation order may be found by topological sorting. Most topological sorting algorithms are also capable of detecting cycles in their inputs; however, it may be desirable to perform cycle detection separately from topological sorting in order to provide appropriate handling for the detected cycles. Assume the simple calculator from before. The equation system \\"A=B; B=D+C; C=D+A; D=12;\\" contains a circular dependency formed by A, B and C, as B must be evaluated before A, C must be evaluated before B and A must be evaluated before C.  Deriving an evaluation order  A correct evaluation order is a numbering n : S \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{N} of the objects that form the nodes of the dependency graph so that the following equation holds: n(a) < n(b) \\\\Rightarrow (a, b) otin R with a, b \\\\in S. This means, if the numbering orders two elements a and b so that a will be evaluated before b, then a must not depend on b. There can be more than one correct evaluation order. In fact, a correct numbering is a topological order, and any topological order is a correct numbering. Thus, any algorithm that derives a correct topological order derives a correct evaluation order. Assume the simple calculator from above once more. Given the equation system \\"A = B+C; B = 5+D; C=4; D=2;\\", a correct evaluation order would be (D, C, B, A). However, (C, D, B, A) is a correct evaluation order as well. Examples Dependency graphs are used in: * Automated software installers: They walk the graph looking for software packages that are required but not yet installed. The dependency is given by the coupling of the packages. * Software build scripts such as Unix Make, Node npm install, php composer, Twitter bower install, or Apache Ant. They need to know what files have changed so only the correct files need to be recompiled. * In compiler technology and formal language implementation: **Instruction scheduling: Dependency graphs are computed for the operands of assembly or intermediate instructions and used to determine an optimal order for the instructions. ** Dead code elimination: If no side effected operation depends on a variable, this variable is considered dead and can be removed. * Dynamic graph analytics: GraphBolt and KickStarter capture value dependencies for incremental computing when graph structure changes. * Spreadsheet calculators. They need to derive a correct calculation order similar to that one in the example used in this article. * Web Forms standards such as XForms to know what visual elements to update if data in the model changes. * Video games, especially puzzle and adventure video games, which are frequently designed as a graph of dependent relationships between in-game actions. Dependency graphs are one aspect of: * Manufacturing plant types: Raw materials are processed into products via several dependent stages. * Job shop scheduling: A collection of related theoretical problems in computer science.

They are all colorless solids. Anhydrous AlF3 is used in the production of aluminium metal. Several occur as minerals. Occurrence and production Aside from anhydrous AlF3, several hydrates are known. With the formula AlF3·xH2O, these compounds include monohydrate (x = 1), two polymorphs of the trihydrate (x = 3), a hexahydrate (x = 6), and a nonahydrate (x = 9). The majority of aluminium fluoride is produced by treating alumina with hydrogen fluoride at 700 °C: Fluorosilicic acid may also be used make aluminum fluoride. :H2SiF6 \\\\+ Al2O3 \\\\+ 3 H2O → 2 AlF3 \\\\+ SiO2 \\\\+ 4 H2O Alternatively, it is manufactured by thermal decomposition of ammonium hexafluoroaluminate. For small scale laboratory preparations, AlF3 can also be prepared by treating aluminium hydroxide or aluminium metal with hydrogen fluoride. Aluminium fluoride trihydrate is found in nature as the rare mineral rosenbergite. The non-hydrated form appears as the mineral oskarssonite.Oskarssonite. Mindat. Structure According to X-ray crystallography, anhydrous AlF3 adopts the rhenium trioxide motif, featuring distorted AlF6 octahedra. Each fluoride is connected to two Al centers. Because of its three-dimensional polymeric structure, AlF3 has a high melting point. The other trihalides of aluminium in the solid state differ, AlCl3 has a layer structure and AlBr3 and AlI3, are molecular dimers. Also they have low melting points and evaporate readily to give dimers.. In the gas phase aluminium fluoride exists as trigonal molecules of D3h symmetry. The Al–F bond lengths of this gaseous molecule are 163 pm. Like most gaseous metal trifluorides, AlF3 adopts a planar structure upon evaporation. Applications Aluminium fluoride is an important additive for the production of aluminium by electrolysis. Together with cryolite, it lowers the melting point to below 1000 °C and increases the conductivity of the solution. It is into this molten salt that aluminium oxide is dissolved and then electrolyzed to give bulk Al metal. Aluminum fluoride complexes are used to study the mechanistic aspects of phosphoryl transfer reactions in biology, which are of fundamental importance to cells, as phosphoric acid anhydrides such as ATP and GTP control most of the reactions involved in metabolism, growth and differentiation. The observation that aluminum fluoride can bind to and activate heterotrimeric G proteins has proven to be useful for the study of G protein activation in vivo, for the elucidation of three-dimensional structures of several GTPases, and for understanding the biochemical mechanism of GTP hydrolysis, including the role of GTPase-activating proteins. =Niche uses= Together with zirconium fluoride, aluminium fluoride is an ingredient for the production of fluoroaluminate glasses. It is also used to inhibit fermentation. Like magnesium fluoride it used as a low-index optical thin film, particularly when far UV transparency is required. Its deposition by physical vapor deposition, particularly by evaporation, is favorable. Safety The reported oral animal lethal dose (LD50) of aluminum fluoride is 0.1 g/kg. Repeated or prolonged inhalation exposure may cause asthma, and may have effects on the bone and nervous system, resulting in bone alterations (fluorosis), and nervous system impairment. Many of the neurotoxic effects of fluoride are due to the formation of aluminum fluoride complexes, which mimic the chemical structure of a phosphate and influence the activity of ATP phosphohydrolases and phospholipase D. Only micromolar concentrations of aluminum are needed to form aluminum fluoride. Human exposure to aluminum fluoride can occur in an industrial setting, such as emissions from aluminum reduction processes, or when a person ingests both a fluoride source (e.g., fluoride in drinking water or residue of fluoride-based pesticides) and an aluminum source; sources of human exposure to aluminum include drinking water, tea, food residues, infant formula, aluminum-containing antacids or medications, deodorants, cosmetics, and glassware. Fluoridation chemicals may also contain aluminum fluoride.

Founded in 1883, it closed on April 1, 2005. History =Beginnings= What became Huron University was founded in 1883 as Presbyterian University of Southern Dakota, founded in Pierre while it was still in Dakota Territory. A year later the school became Pierre University, but was commonly known as Pierre College. On May 31, 1887, the University conferred its first degree, which was the first degree to be awarded in the Dakota Territory. In 1897, the efforts of John L. Pyle, Mamie Shields Pyle, and other Huron residents led to the University's move to Huron, where it became Huron College.* By 1915, the school had become accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (NCA). Two years later one of its alumni won a Rhodes Scholarship and in 1932 one of its attending students also won the award. One student was George M. McCune, co-developer of the McCune-Reischauer romanization of Korean. =For-profit ownership= By the 1980s, the school had become seriously in debt and Midwest Educational Systems Inc., owner of Rapid City-based, for-profit business school National College, agreed to manage the school after the town of Huron agreed to take over existing debt as well as purchase the school's Fine Arts Center for $1.5m. On July 11, 1984 the deal was finalized, marking the end of the school's 100 years of Presbyterian affiliation. The new owner shifted the school's emphasis from liberal arts education to business. After three years of managing the school, Midwest Educational Systems exercised an option to buy the school for $1 and became the Higher Education Corporation of America. In January 1989, the school was sold to Lansdowne University Ltd., a South Dakota corporation with ties to a college in London. The Board of Trustees of the school changed the name to Huron University, and soon opened a new branch: Huron University USA in London, which became an independent institution. In February 1992, Eastern International Education Association, a Delaware-based corporation headed by a member of the Japanese House of Representatives, purchased the school and set up a branch campus in Tokyo. Businessman Chikara Higashi was assigned as president of the university and chairman of the board of trustees. Unfortunately, different management styles and a lack of understanding of the American education system caused problems for the school, and the North Central Association threatened to not renew the school's accreditation in 1996. Higashi resigned in July of that year and the school went up for sale once again. In December 1996, the Huron and Sioux Falls campuses were sold for $3.5 million to for-profit Whitman Education Group, Inc., then owners of Colorado Technical University (CTU). The Sioux Falls campus currently remains a part of the CTU system. A group of local investors bought the Huron campus from Whitman Education Group in August 1999. =Tribal ownership= In April 2001, the University was purchased by Si Tanka College, a former community-college chartered by the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe of the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation. Si Tanka College, named after the Teton Sioux chief of the same name, already had a campus in Eagle Butte, and both campuses became the two-campus Si Tanka University. The Huron campus became Si Tanka University-Huron, the first off-reservation university controlled by a Native American tribe. The Tribe financed the deal with $6.6 million in loans and guarantees from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, but soon found it could not support the school. The federal government grants that the Tribe had been counting on required at least 50% Native American enrollment, and Si Tanka couldn't meet that threshold with its new, primarily white Huron campus. The situation was further complicated by a scandal in April 2002, when a freshman basketball player at Si Tanka was arrested and eventually pleaded guilty to intentionally exposing another student to the AIDS virus. The case received national media coverage and student enrollment the following fall declined by 53 students to 475. The school was faced with too many professors and facilities for its number of students, leading to problems in paying faculty and staff. The property fell into foreclosure in 2004 after the Tribe defaulted on $6.6 million worth of loans and faced a $2 million federal tax lien. On February 26, 2006, the Higher Learning Commission of the NCA voted to revoke the school's accreditation, effective on August 7, 2006, because the school's trustees had voted to cease operation as a university in the previous January . By March 2005, teachers and staff suffered multiple missed paychecks and gave the administration a vote of no confidence, walking off the job and effectively ending classes on March 28, 2005. =Closure= Voorhees Hall at the former Huron College, photographed November 10, 2006 as the campus awaits a potential buyer. The Huron campus officially closed on April 1, 2005, ending its 123-year history. On April 9, Si Tanka filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. By April 25, the U.S. Department of Education alerted the school that it was no longer permitted to take part in federal grants and that its students were no longer eligible for federal student loans. On April 30, an unofficial graduation ceremony was held for the school's final seniors. Northern State University, a public university in Aberdeen took control of the school's transcripts. In February 2006, the Chapter 11 case was dismissed when a federal judge found there weren't enough remaining assets for unsecured creditors. On May 5, 2006, the campus and all its assets were placed onto the auction block, including with classrooms, campus center, dorms, library and gym -- along with bleachers, band uniforms, bookcases and basketball banners. Two empty lots, including the football field, were sold immediately, but as of 2006, the bank was uninterested in selling buildings individually and continued to seek a buyer for the property as a whole. In 2008, the Huron School District bought the University arena. The Fine Arts Center is now owned by the City of Huron and is a community Fine Arts Center. In 2011, the City of Huron voted to tear down the campus to make room for Central Park, which will include a park and new swimming pool complex. Demolition was started on September 19, 2011. Construction was due to start in early 2012, and the park to open Summer 2013.

The Parks Highway intersects the trail at milepost 251.1, two miles north of the center of Healy. Though this intersection marks the present-day eastern terminus of the Stampede Road, Lignite Road continues a few miles east from this intersection to the railroad tracks and the Nenana River. The trail is located near the northern boundary of Denali National Park in a small finger of State of Alaska public land that extends into the national park. The valley, known as the Stampede Valley or the Stampede Corridor, is mostly low-lying tundra and watersheds. The Stampede Trail has been the subject of international attention since the 1992 death of Christopher McCandless, whose remains were found in an abandoned bus deep inside the wilderness about 28 miles down the trail. First brought to the public's attention by Jon Krakauer in an Outside magazine article, a book in 1996, and film in 2007, followed. The landmark's infamy led to an increase in hikers along the trail as well as complaints of a corresponding increase in unprepared hikers who require assistance in the backcountry. Many rescues and deaths occurred annually along the trail. The Alaska State Troopers and the Tri-Valley Fire Department (Healy) were primarily responsible for these rescues and assistance. In June 2020 because of these incidents the State of Alaska arranged for the Alaska National Guard to extract the bus (known as 'Bus 142') from the trail. As part of a training mission, an Alaska Army National Guard CH-47 Chinook helicopter airlifted the bus out of the wilderness and a flatbed truck then transported it to an undisclosed location. The trail currently receives limited tour traffic. In 2015, Alaska Travel Adventures stopped operating Jeep tours along the trail due to deteriorating trail conditions and frequent mechanical problems. Denali Tundra Tours ceased operations of an Argo tour in 2016. As of 2019, Stampede Excursions continues to operate three daily tours along the trail in Pinzgauer 6x6 military grade trucks as well as Volvo C306 6x6 personnel carriers. This tour is called the Denali Backcountry Safari. While they pick up passengers from all Denali area hotels, the 6x6 tours actually begin at their Eight Mile Lake Base Camp at mile 7.5 of the Stampede Road. Their pavilion and other associated buildings are the last permanent structures along the Stampede Road. All tours turn around a few miles east of the Savage River. Traversing the beaver ponds, \\"mud flats,” and crossing the Teklanika River are major obstacles preventing most vehicles from continuing more than 5 miles or so down the trail. During the fall, hunting traffic along the trail is heavy as the area is prime habitat for moose. Many hunters use ATV's or Argos to access hunting camps. Moose hunting in this area generally yields high success rates. Winter travel by snowmobile, dog sled, or tracked vehicle is much easier than summer travel after the boggy tundra, beaver ponds, and rivers freeze. In September 2017, Circle the Globe Productions filmed a pilot episode for a possible new TV series along the trail and at the bus. Logistics and equipment were provided by Stampede Excursions and Alaska Mountaineering School. The series is hosted by J.J. Kelley, titled \\"Off the Map,” and was set to premiere on the Travel Channel on July 18, 2018. The full episode is also available online on Vimeo. Since the death of Christopher McCandless in 1992, two additional people have lost their lives attempting to reach the infamous Bus 142 (which was removed entirely from the area in June 2020). In 2010, Claire Ackermann of Switzerland drowned in the Teklanika River while attempting to cross. She had tied herself off to a preexisting rope that spanned a fast moving stretch of river. When the water became too deep, she lost footing and drowned before she could be cut free. In 2019, a similar incident occurred in the same location. Veranika Nikanava of Belarus perished in the same way, attempting to cross the river while tied off to a rope. Any future hikers are strongly urged to avoid tying themselves to ropes as a method of crossing Alaskan rivers. After Nikanava’s death, her husband is attempting to raise funds and awareness for a potential cable crossing or bridge at this location. History The Stampede Trail began as the \\"Lignite to Kantishna\\" mining trail blazed in 1903 by prospectors drawn to the Kantishna region by the discovery of placer gold. In the 1930s miner Earl Pilgrim used the trail to access his antimony claims on Stampede Creek at , above the Clearwater Fork of the Toklat River. For many years, the mine was accessed through the use of a winter trail. Antimony ore was shipped east to the railroad through the use of “Cat Trains,” sleds loaded with ore and towed by Caterpillar Bulldozers. Fuel and supplies for the mine were backhauled in the same way. The overland cat trains could take 3 or more days of travel time and February was the generally the best month for such winter trail travel. In 1960, Yutan Construction won a contract from the new state of Alaska to upgrade the trail as part of Alaska's Pioneer Road Program, building a road for trucks to haul ore from the mine year-round for transshipment to the railroad at Lignite (near the present day town of Healy.) Construction was discontinued in 1961 after only of road were built. No bridges were constructed over the several rivers it crossed. In 1963 maintenance was halted and the route promptly became impassable for road vehicles by the soft permafrost and seasonal flooding. The trail has since been used by backcountry travelers on foot, bicycle, dog sleds, snowmachines, and all-terrain vehicles. The trail's main obstacle is crossing the Teklanika River during the summer months when the river swells with snowmelt. The Alaska State Troopers report that several rescues were necessary every year at the river crossing. In August 2010, high water resulted in the drowning death of Claire Ackermann, a hiker from Switzerland and in July 2019 Veranika Nikanava of Belarus was also swept downstream and drowned. Hundreds of hikers attempted to reach Bus 142 every year, until its removal in June 2020. Bus 142 Hikers take a break at Bus 142 on the Stampede Trail. Fairbanks City Transit System Bus 142 was a 1946 International Harvester K-5 bus abandoned in a clearing at along the Stampede Trail near Denali National Park. It was originally one of three buses used by the Yutan Construction Company to provide site accommodations for the construction crew from Fairbanks that worked on road upgrades in 1960–1961. It was towed on location by a Caterpillar D8 bulldozer as the engine had been removed. It contained a couple of beds and a wood-burning stove. When the Stampede Mine ceased operations in the 1970s, the buses were removed from the trail, but Bus 142 was left behind due to a broken rear axle to serve as a shelter for hunters, trappers, and visitors. The bus gained notoriety in January 1993 when Outside magazine published an article written by Jon Krakauer titled \\"Death of an Innocent\\"Death of an Innocent – How Christopher McCandless lost his way in the wilds describing the death of Christopher McCandless, an American hitchhiker who lived in the bus during the summer of 1992 while attempting to survive off the Alaskan wilderness only to die of starvation three and a half months later. The bus, also known as the \\"Magic Bus\\" as per McCandless's own writings, became a pilgrimage site for visitors seeking the location where McCandless perished. The 2007 film version of Jon Krakauer's 1996 book about McCandless, Into the Wild, revived more interest in the bus. In 2013, Dave Gill from the United Kingdom visited the bus as part of a British documentary publishing project. The post on his website shows that as of 2013, visitors have shot at the bus and caused damage, resulting in its accelerated deterioration. On June 18, 2020, various government agencies coordinated a training mission with the Alaska Army National Guard to remove the bus, deemed a public safety issue after numerous visitor rescue incidents. It was flown out of the wilderness by a CH-47 Chinook helicopter to Healy and then by flatbed truck to an undisclosed location. On September 24, 2020, the Museum of The North at the University of Alaska (Fairbanks) announced it became the permanent home of McCandless' 'Magic Bus 142' where it will be restored and an outdoor exhibit will be created.

Comyns Carr. The medieval Faustian story concerns an ugly, crippled girl, who dreams of being beautiful and meeting a handsome prince. The Devil offers her a magical stone that confers perfect beauty to anyone who wears it. The stone is passed from one character to another, but eventually the prince recognizes the girl's beautiful soul, the stone is discarded, and the disappointed Devil leaves the town. It premiered at the Savoy Theatre on 28 May 1898, closing on 16 July 1898 after a run of just 50 performances, making it the least successful of Sullivan's operas. Reviewers criticised the lyrics and lengthy dialogue scenes and the lack of humour in the story. Savoy audiences, accustomed to more comic and satiric pieces, did not find the opera attractive. The cast of The Beauty Stone included Savoy regulars Walter Passmore, Rosina Brandram, Ruth Vincent, Emmie Owen and Henry Lytton, as well as opera singer Pauline Joran. The opera was revived by the Carl Rosa Opera Company in 1901–02 on tour in a cut version. Background Spy in Vanity Fair: \\"An Art Critic\\" When the Gilbert and Sullivan partnership collapsed after the production of The Gondoliers in 1889, their producer Richard D'Oyly Carte struggled to find successful new works to show at the Savoy Theatre. Carte produced Sullivan's grand opera, Ivanhoe at another theatre, and afterwards, he turned to Sullivan to create more comic operas for the Savoy. With Sydney Grundy, Sullivan wrote the nostalgic and sentimental Haddon Hall (1892) then, reunited with W. S. Gilbert, he produced Utopia, Limited (1893). He next returned, with his earlier collaborator F. C. Burnand, with The Chieftain (1894) and collaborated for the last time with Gilbert on The Grand Duke (1896). None of these had proved to be more than modestly successful, and Carte's other new pieces for the Savoy in the 1890s had done no better. Following the success of Sullivan's ballet Victoria and Merrie England in 1897, Carte asked Sullivan to work on another new opera for the Savoy.Coles, Clifton. Notes on the text of The Beauty Stone, The Gilbert & Sullivan Archive, accessed 5 October 2011 Carte assembled a high quality team for The Beauty Stone, hoping for a hit. J. Comyns Carr had earlier written the text for Henry Irving's grand production of the King Arthur legend, for which Sullivan had provided the incidental music score in 1895. Sullivan had in the past considered the idea of an opera on the same subject and was pleased when Carr offered him a similarly romantic work with a medieval setting.Gordon- Powell, Robin. Notes to programme for Sir Arthur Sullivan Society Festival Concert, 16 September 2006, London The eponymous beauty stone was a magical item that would transform its holder's appearance but would have unanticipated consequences. Sullivan seemed not to notice that this major element of the plot was simply a variant of the \\"magic lozenge\\" plot that Gilbert had so often proposed to the composer, and that he had repeatedly rejected.Gordon- Powell, Robin. Introduction to full score of The Beauty Stone, The Amber Ring, (2010) ISMN M-708031-65-9 A. W. Pinero was at the height of his career in 1898, having produced several enduring successes in the 1890s, including The Second Mrs. Tanqueray (1893) and The Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith (1895), and the same year as The Beauty Stone he would produce Trelawny of the 'Wells' (1898). One of the most important, prolific and popular British playwrights, Pinero was later knighted for his services to dramatic authorship. Carr conceived of the basic idea of the libretto, that true beauty is an inner quality. Carr confined himself to writing the lyrics, however, and Pinero was brought in to work out the plot and write the dialogue. Having brought together three such eminent talents, Carte had high expectations, and there was much anticipation in the press. Pinero and Comyns Carr The Beauty Stone was conceived as a musical drama different in style from the productions that had preceded it at the Savoy Theatre. Sullivan's intention was to create a work halfway between the romantic flights of his grand opera Ivanhoe and the familiar humour of the earlier Savoy operas. The composer, however, soon found that Carr's lyrics were unwieldy and difficult to set to music. In mid-December 1897, he wrote in his diary that his collaborators were difficult; when he asked for changes in the construction of the piece, they refused to make the alterations.Jacobs, p. 384 He was forced to involve Helen Carte to mediate the disagreements with his collaborators. Even so, Sullivan continued to be disappointed in what he had to work with. In February 1898, he wrote in his diary: \\"[H]eartbreaking to have to try to make a musical piece out of such badly constructed (for music) mess of involved sentences.\\"Parry, William. \\"Liner notes to The Beauty Stone\\", Chandos, 2013, pp. 22–25 Nevertheless, after working further with Carr in March, he was able to work out the key difficulties, and his struggles with the complexity of the lyrics seems to have inspired some of Sullivan's longest melodic lines and interesting musical settings.Still, Sullivan later told the Daily News, \\"I think the work has proved more arduous than anything else I have ever done\\". Quoted in Gordon-Powell, Robin. Introduction to full score of The Beauty Stone, The Amber Ring, (2010) ISMN M-708031-65-9 Rehearsals began early in April 1898. Moreover, the Savoy was not the right place to produce such a drama, because its audience was used to seeing comic operas focused on wit, humour and Gilbertian satire. To provide them with a mostly dark-toned romantic piece consisting of pseudo-medieval dialogue (and too much of it), lengthy grand-operatic musical numbers and a serious exploration of complex characters turned out to be a grave mistake. In addition, The Beauty Stone is a very long piece - it played for nearly four hours on opening night; several items were cut soon after opening night, but the cuts did not improve matters. At the same time, competition from the new theatrical art form of George Edwardes-style musical comedy produced at other London theatres offered lighthearted entertainment choices to the Savoy audience, with catchy tunes, dancing and witty banter. For a modern audience, however, there is much to admire about The Beauty Stone. Pinero's book, though overly long, contains vivid characters with psychological depth that Sullivan was able to develop more fully than in his shorter comic operas. The complex way in which these characters react to the beauty stone makes this plot device different from the way Gilbert treated his magic lozenges and gave Sullivan a chance to employ rich musical portraits of yearning, despair, love and beauty. Production, reception and aftermath Savoy Theatre programme The Beauty Stone premiered at the Savoy Theatre on 28 May 1898. Sullivan conducted the premiere, as he always did with his operas. It closed on 16 July 1898 after a run of just 50 performances, making it the least successful of Sullivan's operas. In contrast, the most successful shows that opened in London in 1898 had far longer runs: The Belle of New York (697 performances); A Greek Slave (349 performances); and A Runaway Girl (593 performances). The cast of The Beauty Stone included Savoy regulars Walter Passmore, Rosina Brandram, Ruth Vincent, Emmie Owen and Henry Lytton. Some of the music is more challenging than the typical Savoy Opera, and so Sullivan insisted on casting several opera singers, including Covent Garden opera soprano Pauline Joran as Saida (at an increased salary), and the size of the chorus was increased. Choreography was by John D'Auban.Savoy Theatre playbill, The Beauty Stone, 28 May 1898 Costumes by Percy Anderson and sets by William Telbin, Jr. (d. 1931) were universally praised by the critics.\\"The Beauty Stone\\", The Lute, 1 July 1898, pp. 717–18 Savoy Theatre audiences were not enthusiastic about the piece. \\"The Savoy is in the minds of the public so essentially identified with a light after-dinner entertainment that romantic opera is not to the taste of its patrons\\".Glasgow Herald, '11 July 1898 Reviewers noted that the opera was \\"mounted with the artistic finish, completeness, and liberality customary at this popular theatre. Sir Arthur has had to deal with a subject differing widely from those which, at the Savoy, his dainty and humorous muse is so thoroughly identified. This, and the inferiority of the lyrics … must be taken into account. … Speaking for ourselves, we confess freely to disappointment.\\"The Observer, 29 May 1898 They found it too long, disjointed and dull, disliked the pseudo- archaic dialogue and nearly all condemned the lyrics. They noted its lack of humour and the satire for which Savoy pieces had been famous. A few critics found much to like in the story, and many praised most of the cast (except for Philip and Guntran) and Sullivan's music, or at least some of it. In The Saturday Review, Max Beerbohm wrote, \\"Lyrics written by gentlemen who have had no experience in the difficult art of writing words for music, and sung in a theatre which one associates with Mr. W. S. Gilbert, are not likely to charm the most amenable audience.\\" He said of Carr and Pinero, \\"I am sure that the indisputable dulness of their Beauty Stone comes, mainly, from their pseudo- archaic manner.\\"Beerbohm, Max, \\"The Beauty Stone\\", The Saturday Review, 4 June 1898, p. 744 Pinero commented, many years later: \\"I doubt whether any of us had much faith in The Beauty Stone, as likely to attract the Savoy public in large numbers, but we – Sullivan, Carr and I – did what we wanted to do; and, though it doesn't pay the butcher's bill, there lies the artist's reward.\\"\\"Savoy Memories\\", The Times, 19 June 1914, p. 6 Sullivan disagreed, hoping \\"that one day The Beauty Stone may be revived, with about half the libretto ruthlessly cut away\\".Lawrence, pp. 200–01 The opera was revived on tour by the Carl Rosa Opera Company in 1901–02, which drastically cut the dialogue, reducing the running time of the piece to about 2½ hours.\\"News from All Parts\\", The Musical Herald, 1 January 1902, vol. 646, p. 14 and \\"Musical Gossip of the Month\\", Musical Opinion and Music Trade Review, 25:293, February 1902, p. 350. A Berlin production was also announced in 1901 (see \\"People and Things\\", The Musical Standard, 9 March 1901, p. 151) though it is doubtful that it took place, as no mention of it is found in the press either in London or Berlin.No other professional productions have been recorded, but amateur productions have been mounted since 1921. See Gordon-Powell, Robin, Introduction to full score of The Beauty Stone. When Sullivan died, his autograph scores passed to his nephew, Herbert Sullivan, and then to Herbert's widow. After her death, the collection was broken up and sold by auction at Sotheby's in London on 13 June 1966.Catalogue of Valuable Printed Books, Music, Autograph Letters and Historical Documents... auction by Messrs. Sotheby & Co., London, 13 June 1966 Some items were sold for considerable sums (the score of Trial by Jury sold for £9,000), but the manuscript of The Beauty Stone sold for a mere £110 to a dealer\\"Prices and Buyers' Names\\", Sotheby & Co. Sale of Valuable Printed Books, Music, Autograph Letters and Historical Documents, 13 June 1966 and eventually was acquired by the collector Colin Prestige. Upon his death, almost forty years later, the manuscript was bequeathed to Oriel College, Oxford, and in December 2005 scholars from the Sir Arthur Sullivan Society were able to examine the manuscript, along with other Sullivan autograph manuscripts. They discovered, at the back of The Beauty Stone, the items that had been cut after opening night, which were completely unknown to that time. Since then, these items have been performed in concert and included on the 2013 Chandos recording, although no full professional productions of the opera have been given since Carl Rosa's over a century ago.

It is a sombre, wretched-looking dwelling. Simon and his wife, Joan, sing a duet about their dreary lives. Joan has sent their daughter, Laine, into the town to buy bread and draw water. Simon fears that Laine, who is ugly and crippled, will be mocked by the town folk. On her way home, Laine is accosted by townsfolk, who try to force her to kiss a dwarf. They all burst into Simon's home. Laine's water pitcher is broken, but Jacqueline rescues her from further harm. Philip, Lord of Mirlemont, has announced a beauty contest, which is to be held in the market-place later that day, and has drawn beautiful girls from many adjoining towns. Laine dreams of getting a close look at the gallant Philip and his companion, Saida, but her mother discourages her. When her parents leave, Laine sings a prayer to the Virgin Mary: she wishes for beauty, so that she can experience love; otherwise, she wishes to die. The Devil arrives, although she mistakes him for a holy friar. He offers his sympathy, and says that he has an answer to her prayers in the form of a magical stone that confers perfect beauty to anyone who wears it. Laine's parents return. Though initially surprised to find a stranger in their midst, they too believe that the Devil is a holy man. The Devil further explains the stone's magical powers. Simon eagerly accepts the stone and gives it to Laine, who goes to her chamber to put it on. Joan fears that the stone may bring bad luck with it. The Devil explains that he has often given the stone away, but it always comes back. However, all of their doubts are overlooked when Laine re-enters, wondrously beautiful. Scene 2 In the market-place of Mirlemont, the people of the town gather for the beauty contest. A competitor crowned with lilies enters with her supporters, but most of the townspeople doubt that she will win. Owen as Jacqueline The Devil, now posing as a nobleman, has a letter of introduction to Lord Philip, which he presents to Guntran, Philip's loyal friend. Guntran complains that Philip is distracted by the pursuit of beauty, and is not sufficiently attentive to warfare. The Devil comments that Mirlemont is a more \\"vastly interesting\\" place than he had expected. He recruits Jacqueline, disguising her as a boy, Jacques, to serve as his page. Philip and his entourage enter for the beauty contest. Several maidens vie for his attention, but he is not impressed with any of them. The Devil suggests that, as there is \\"so little beauty\\" in Mirlemont, the Prince should instead order the ugliest man, the dwarf Peppin, to marry the ugliest woman. The Burgomaster suggests the weaver's daughter, Laine. The chorus call for Laine, but when she enters, she is now transcendently beautiful. Philip is entranced, but the rest of the townsfolk suspect she is a witch. Philip is convinced that anyone so beautiful must be innocent, and he anoints her as fairest of the fair. =Act II= Scene 1 In a hall in Castle Mirlemont, Philip plays cards with a party of knights and ladies. A messenger from the Duke of Burgundy arrives, requesting Philip's presence in battle, but Philip refuses, saying that he is no longer a man of war. Saida, Philip's former favourite, tells the Devil that Laine must be burned at the stake for witchcraft. The Devil advises her that she should instead try to learn for herself the mysterious secret behind Laine's sudden transformation. Saida dances for Philip. She briefly recaptures his attention, but he transfers it immediately to Laine when she enters, now richly dressed in fine robes. Philip is enchanted by Laine's beauty. She explains that a holy man is responsible for the miracle, but her parents have forbidden her from saying any more. Philip insists that he loves her. She suspects that his attentions are fleeting, but says that she loves him in return. Laine's elderly parents, Simon and Joan, arrive at the castle, seeking to join their daughter. The Devil tells Philip that he will get rid of them, and he leads them away. He has guards beat them and drive them from the castle. Doubting Philip's honour, Laine asks to leave, but Philip locks the doors. Laine begs to be released, saying that she no longer wishes to be beautiful. Philip relents, and she rushes out. Encouraged by the Devil, Saida follows her, hoping to acquire Laine's magical beauty. Knights en route to battle arrive at Philip's castle for a brief rest, but Philip refuses to greet them. Guntran is disgusted at Philip's lack of interest, recalling heroic deeds of Philip's youth. The knights urge Philip to join the battle, and when he refuses, Guntran names Philip as a coward. Stirred by this, Philip changes his mind and says that he will join the battle after all. Scene 2 Back in the weaver's home, Joan and Simon have escaped the ruffians that chased them from Philip's castle. Laine returns. She is still in her rich clothes, but she has decided to relinquish the stone that has made her beautiful. She removes it from her neck, throws it on the ground, and hurries into her bed-chamber. Saida (Pauline Joran) seduces Simon (Henry Lytton, now transformed into a youth) Joan and Simon debate what to do with the stone. Joan fears that it brings evil to those to wear it, but she puts the stone around Simon's neck. He is transformed into a handsome, younger man. Saida and the Devil arrive, looking for the stone. When they see Simon, the Devil realizes what has happened. He encourages Saida to seduce him, so that she may gain the stone for herself. Scene 3 In an open field near the Gate of Mirlemont, the Devil interrogates Jacqueline, whom he has directed to spy on Simon and Saida. She says that she observed the two of them walking arm in arm in a meadow, with Saida trying desperately, but unsuccessfully, to coax the secret from him. When Saida arrives, the Devil encourages her to take Simon to the castle and continue her seduction. While Simon and Saida are together, they encounter Joan and Laine, but he will have nothing to do with them. To the sound of trumpets, Philip enters, dressed for battle. He announces that he has wearied of beauty, and is going to war. Joan and Laine beg Philip to intercede with Saida, whom they believe has abducted Simon. Philip dismisses their tale as gossip, and does not recognize Laine, who is once again ugly and crippled. The townsfolk raise Philip on their shoulders, and they go off to battle, leaving Laine trampled and senseless. =Act III= Scene 1 On a terrace in the castle, with the voice of Laine heard singing dolefully in the distance, Saida enters with Simon. He is enchanted with her, but he is still unwilling to confess the secret. When he hears Laine singing again, he is overcome with guilt. A servant announces that Philip has been victorious in battle. Simon presumes that he will be expelled from the castle, but Saida promises to keep him there. At last, Simon tells her the secret of the stone. The Devil enters with Jacqueline. He frets that Saida needs to extract the stone from Simon before Lord Philip returns. In the meantime, he orders Jacqueline to sing a song. When she admits that she is in love with him, he dismisses her from service, saying that she is no longer of any use. Saida comes in and stands boldly facing the Devil; having taken the stone from Simon, she is now restored to youthful beauty. After she sings a triumphant aria, Simon follows, once again a bent old man. She crassly orders him to leave, and the Devil threatens him with a charge of witchcraft should he complain. Philip and Guntran return from the war. Philip has fought heroically, but has lost his eyesight, and is now blind. Although Saida is now the most beautiful maid in Mirlemont, he is unable to see her. Laine's voice is heard once again outside, and Philip asks to speak with her. Saida warns that she is a cripple once again, but Philip replies that her soul is beautiful. The defeated Saida throws the stone away, and the Devil picks it up, noting ruefully that the stone always comes back. Scene 2 At the market-place, the townsfolk assemble once again to greet the victorious Philip. Simon, who is once again dressed in rags, is reunited with Joan. Jacqueline enters in a daze and runs into the Devil, who is once again dressed as a holy friar. She has no memory of her week of service to the Devil, and she asks for the friar's blessing. Philip enters and announces that he has chosen Laine, \\"the humblest among you,\\" as his betrothed. \\"Though heaven hath set a veil upon these eyes,\\" he says, \\"love's one star ... Shows clear the way that leads me to thy heart.\\" The Devil quits the town, disappointed that his joke did not turn out as he had intended.

(Kombinat Górniczo-Hutniczy Miedzi), commonly known as KGHM, is a Polish multinational corporation that employs around 34,000 people around the world and has been a major copper and silver producer for more than 50 years. In 1991, the company was established as a state enterprise and since 1997, their shares have been traded on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. Currently, KGHM operates 9 open-pit and underground mines located in Poland, Canada, the USA and Chile and is actively advancing 4 projects. KGHM produces key global resources including copper, copper sulphate, gold, silver, nickel, nickel sulphate, molybdenum, rhenium, lead, sulphuric acid, selenium, platinum group metals. KGHM is based in Lower Silesian Voivodeship in Lubin, Poland.  History  = Early history and foundation = In 1951, the construction of the Copper Smelter in Legnica was commenced to smelt copper from the ore mined in the so-called old Lower Silesian copper basin (\\"Lena\\" and \\"Konrad\\" mines). In 1957, Jan Wyżykowski discovered copper ore deposits near Lubin and Polkowice (\\"Sieroszowice\\" field). On December 28, 1959 by the decision of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, Zakłady Górnicze \\"Lubin\\" was established as a state owned company and in 1961, transformed into Kombinat Górniczo-Hutniczy Miedzi (KGHM), which was supposed to deal with the extraction and processing of copper extracted from the newly discovered fields. At the same time, KGHM incorporated two copper mines in the area of the piedmont of the Sudetes from the old copper-bearing basin (closed in 1973 - \\"Lena\\" and in 1987 - \\"Konrad\\"). = Expansion = In the years 1962-1975, Tadeusz Zastawnik was the director of KGHM (in the years 1952-1957 he was a Member of Parliament, and in the mid-1950s the director of the Union of Mining and Metallurgy of Non-Ferrous Metals). In 1968, the construction of the \\"Lubin\\" and \\"Polkowice\\" mines and the modernization of the Legnica smelter ended. The construction of the Głogów smelter started, and at the end of the 1960s, geologists discovered new, even richer copper deposits in Rudna. In January 1996, the \\"Polkowice-Sieroszowice\\" Division was established, which was established as the result of the merger \\"Polkowice\\" and \\"Sieroszowice\\" mines. From the day the state enterprise was established, until August 9, 1976, the Minister of Heavy Industry, and then the Minister of Metallurgy (the office was transformed into the office of the Minister of Metallurgy and Machine Industry) supervised operations. = Transformation = On September 9, 1991, the state-owned enterprise Kombinat Górniczo-Hutniczy Miedzi in Lubin was transformed into a sole-shareholder company of the State Treasury - KGHM Polska Miedź SA. On September 12, 1991, the company was entered in the commercial register kept by the District Court in Legnica and on the same day, the court removed the former entity from the register of state-owned enterprises. = Integration = On December 6, 2011, the management boards of KGHM Polska Miedź SA and Quadra FNX Mining Ltd. signed an agreement on the takeover of the Canadian enterprise by KGHM. On February 20, 2012, the general meeting of shareholders of Quadra FNX Mining Ltd. accepted the transaction of a friendly takeover of 100% of shares in the company Quadra FNX by KGHM Polska Miedź SA, and on March 5, 2012, the above transaction was closed. Since then, Quadra FNX has been operating under the new name of KGHM International Ltd. The transaction value amounted to approximately $2.8 billion. The purchase was financed with funds of KGHM After the acquisition, the size of the combined resource base is 37.4 million tons of copper (fourth largest deposit in the world). The combined annual copper production was then 526 thousand tonnes. One of the key assets of KGHM International Ltd. is the Sierra Gorda field. The deposit is located in Chile and contains 1.3 billion tons of ore rich in copper, gold and molybdenum. It was expected that copper mining from Sierra Gorda would start in 2014 and exceed 200,000 tons per year. = Recent developments = In May 2015, a new production line was launched at the Nitroerg plant in Bieruń . Corporate affairs =Structure= KGHM Polska Miedź currently has two subsidiaries: * KGHM International Ltd. is a wholly owned subsidiary * Sierra Gorda SCM is a 55% subsidiary = Leadership = KGHM is led by a five-member management board, which is led by president and CEO Marcin Chludziński. The other members are Radosław Stach, Katarzyna Kreczmańska-Gigol, Adam Bugajczuk and Paweł Gruza. The supervisory board is led by chairman Andrzej Kisielewicz and vice chairman Leszek Banaszak. = Shareholder = Since July 1997, KGHM has been listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. As of February 2019 the company's shareholder structure is: * 31.79% - Polish State Treasury *5.05% - Nationale-Nederlanden OFE * 5.02% - Aviva OFE *58.13% - Other shareholders Operations KGHM has operations in the main areas mining and enrichment, metallurgy (smelting and refining) and project development and is currently active in four countries: Poland, Canada, Chile and the USA. In 2017, the company produced a total of 656 thousand tons of copper, 1,234 thousand tons of silver, 117 thousand troy ounces of gold, and 10 thousand tons of molybdenum. = Mining and enrichment = Robinson Mine The Robinson Mine is located in Nevada. It is an open pit mine that produces copper with byproduct gold and molybdenum. It was KGHM International's most profitable mine, pulling in a net revenue of $532.9 million in 2012. Carlota Mine The Carlota Mine is located in Arizona. Like the Robinson mine, it is an open pit mine and produces copper. It is scheduled to close in 2013, despite operating through multiple court challenges. Its net revenue for 2012 was $84.1 million.  Sierra Gorda  Sierra Gorda Project mining in Chile is a Copper-Molybdenum open pit mine which started production on October 1, 2014 and is a jointly operated by KGHM International Ltd (55%), Sumitomo Metal Mining Co. (31.5%) and Sumitomo Corporation (13.5%). Franke Mine The Franke Mine is located in northern Chile. It is also an open pit mine and produces copper. Its net revenue for 2012 was $152.5 million. KGHM International is blending Franke pit with a partnered China mine, with less mining being focused on Franke. =Smelting and refining= KGHM owns three copper smelters: \\"Głogów\\", \\"Legnica\\", and \\"Cedynia\\". KGHM's smelters also produce lead, refined lead, sulphuric acid, nickel sulphate, and platinum-palladium concentrate. =Projects under development= *Deep Głogów *Victoria *Ajax Mine Project *Sierra Gorda mine  Awards and recognitions  In 2011, the company was awarded with the Fray International Sustainability Award in Mexico, for its achievements and investments towards sustainable development.

The contract for her construction was awarded on 24 June 1863 to George C. Bestor of Peoria, Illinois. Her keel was laid down later that year at the yard of Charles W. McCordat of St. Louis, Missouri. However, while Shiloh was still under construction, , one of the first of the Casco-class monitors to be launched, was found to be unseaworthy. Design revisions Though the original designs for the Casco-class monitors were drawn by John Ericsson, the final revision was created by Chief Engineer Alban C. Stimers following Rear Admiral Samuel F. Du Pont's failed bombardment of Fort Sumter in 1863. By the time that the plans were put before the Monitor Board in New York City, Ericsson and Stimers had a poor relationship, and Chief of the Bureau of Construction and Repair John Lenthall had little connection to the board. This resulted in the plans being approved and 20 vessels ordered without serious scrutiny of the new design. US$14 million was allocated for the construction of these vessels. It was discovered that Stimers had failed to compensate for the armor his revisions added to the original plan and this resulted in excessive stress on the wooden hull frames and a freeboard of only . Stimers was removed from the control of the project and Ericsson was called in to undo the damage. He was forced to raise the hulls of the monitors under construction by to make them seaworthy. On 25 June 1864, the Navy Department ordered Shiloh's builder to raise her deck to give her sufficient freeboard, then on 17 June 1865, after the end of the Civil War had prompted an American naval retrenchment, work on Shiloh was ordered suspended. Nevertheless, it was decided to proceed with her launching; and an unsuccessful attempt to get her off the ways was made on 3 July 1865. After much labor, the ship finally entered the water 11 days later. Fate Shiloh saw no service before being laid up in 1866 at Mound City, Illinois. On 15 June 1869, she was renamed . In the same year, she was moved to New Orleans and laid up there. On 17 September 1874, the monitor was commissioned; but she saw no significant service before she was decommissioned on 5 October 1874 and again laid up at New Orleans on 15 October 1874. She was sold later that year.  References  Bibliography *Roberts, William H.

He played rugby union for Newport and rugby league for Bradford Northern. Trevor Foster was a Sergeant Physical Training Instructor in the British Army during World War II. Early years Trevor Foster was born on 3 December 1914 in Newport, Monmouthshire, but is best known for his association with the Bradford Northern rugby league club having joined them as a player in 1938 for £400 from Newport RFC, his home town's rugby union club. He made a name for himself playing for Newport Schoolboys and Pill Harriers as a teenager, before joining Newport. He was also chosen to play for invitational team Crawshays.Newport RFC player profile blackandambers.co.uk  Bradford Northern career  In all he played 428 games for Bradford Northern, usually as a and occasionally a . During this time he scored 140 tries (an incredible return for a forward) including 24 in the 1947-48 season and 6 in 1 game.(It could have been 7 but the ball was knocked from his hands as he crossed the line.) Trevor was the key forward of an outstanding Bradford Northern side in the post war period which won the Rugby League Challenge Cup in 1947 and 1949 with Trevor scoring in both games. The Northern side at this time had some great Welsh players including mercurial Willie Davies, s Des Case and Alan Edwards, and of course Frank Whitcombe at .  Great Britain and Wales caps  Trevor Foster won caps for Wales while at Bradford Northern 1939…1951 16-caps, including 7 as captain, and won caps for Great Britain while at Bradford Northern in 1946 against New Zealand, and in 1948 against Australia (2 matches) It is certain he would have won more caps had it not been for World War II. In 1946 he was selected for the winning Ashes tour of Australia, but was injured before being able to play a game.

Other notable matches Trevor Foster played left- and was captain for Northern Command XIII against a Rugby League XIII at Thrum Hall, Halifax on Saturday 21 March 1942.  Unblemished disciplinary record  Remarkably for a forward of the time Trevor was never sent from the field of play or even cautioned during his 17 years of top flight rugby.  Retirement and coaching  After his retirement in 1955 he remained a servant of the Bradford club successively as Coach, Director and Chairman of the Supporters Club and timekeeper for Super League home games.  Club saviour  It was in 1963 when he secured his place in Bradford and Rugby League history when he was the central figure in a campaign to save his beloved Bradford Northern club who had disbanded due to financial problems. He led efforts to reconstitute the club which was then able to rejoin the league the following season. Without his work it is unlikely that the club would exist today.

A breakthrough came in the following year when the company performed at The Space in New York City through director Alwin Nikolais. Representatives of the National Endowment for the Arts attended the performance and accepted the company for the Endowment's Artists In Schools and Dance Touring Programs. The company's acceptance in these programs offered full-time touring as a national company and the most \\"Artists In Schools\\" performances in the United States of any company for 12 years. Ririe-Woodbury Dance Company was chosen to be part of the Dance On Tour state-touring program from 1990 to 1994 and performed in South Carolina, Kentucky, Montana and New Mexico. The Company continued to perform internationally. In 1977, the International Congress of Girls' and Women's Sports invited the Company to South Africa for an extended tour of Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Johannesburg and Pretoria, marking the first time that a nationally and racially diverse performing group had performed in those areas. In 1978, they were chosen by the United States as representatives to the first Dance and the Child International meeting in Canada. In 1980 Ririe-Woodbury Dance Company was selected as the first U.S. modern dance company to perform in Šibenik of former Yugoslavia. The company also performed in Hong Kong, the Philippines and Singapore. In 2002 Ririe-Woodbury became the first modern dance company to perform in Canton, China. From 1987-1992 company tours included Europe, American Samoa, and the former Soviet Union. Just one month before the destruction of the Berlin Wall, the dancers performed in East Germany and were the first modern dancers to perform in Karl-Marx Stadt in the former Soviet Union and East Berlin in 15 years. In 1993, the company traveled to Slovenia. Ririe-Woodbury performed a benefit fundraiser for 70,000 Bosnian war refugees who were seeking shelter in Slovenian collection centers. Recently, the Nikolais/Louis Foundation for Dance selected Ririe-Woodbury as the dance company to house the works of modern dance innovator Alwin Nikolais, as his company, Nikolais Dance Theatre was no longer in operation. Ririe-Woodbury's performances of works by Nikolais have received five-star reviews in the New York Times and the LA Times. In 2004 Ririe-Woodbury was one of five dance companies invited to perform at the Edinburgh International Festival. In 2006, the company presented Nikolais's \\"Tensile Involvement\\" at the Fall for Dance Festival in New York City. External links * *Nikolais-Louis Foundation for Dance, Inc.

Invariably, the name refers to a compound of the composition , formed by the reaction of aluminium and iodine or the action of on metal. The hexahydrate is obtained from a reaction between metallic aluminum or aluminum hydroxide with hydrogen iodide or hydroiodic acid. Like the related chloride and bromide, is a strong Lewis acid and will absorb water from the atmosphere. It is employed as a reagent for the scission of certain kinds of C-O and N-O bonds. It cleaves aryl ethers and deoxygenates epoxides. Structure Solid is dimeric, consisting of , similar to that of AlBr3. The structure of monomeric and dimeric forms have been characterized in the gas phase. The monomer, is trigonal planar with a bond length of 2.448(6) Å, and the bridged dimer, at 430 K is a similar to Al2Cl6 and Al2Br6 with bond lengths of 2.456(6) Å (terminal) and 2.670(8) Å (bridging).

Few drops of water are added to a homogenised mixture of aluminum powder and powdered iodine. After short time (an induction period) a vigorous reaction occurs followed by emission of intense colored vapors. The purple vapours are due to evaporation of iodine as a consequence of increased temperature of the system, and the brown ones are probably due to smoke of an adduct of the reaction product with excess of iodine. The exergonic reaction is at the origin of the phenomenon observed. The name \\"aluminium iodide\\" is widely assumed to describe the triiodide or its dimer.

A native of Fulton County, Illinois, Taylor is a 1959 graduate of Cuba High School. He received his bachelor's degree in English from Knox College in 1963, and then served in the United States Navy for three and one-half years, including a year in Vietnam, before entering law Northwestern University School of Law in 1968. He graduated with honors from Northwestern in 1971 and served as an editor of the law review. After law school, he practiced law at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Chicago, ultimately becoming partner with the international firm. Taylor joined the Knox College Board of Trustees in 1998 and served as its chair from 1999-2001. He became interim president in 2001, after the departure of Knox's 17th president, Richard Millman, and was officially installed as president of Knox College in October 2002. He served in that role until retiring in 2011. His wife, Anne Zweifel Taylor, is a 1963 alumna of Knox. Work as President At his installation, Taylor set three goals for his tenure as Knox's president: Nurturing Academic Excellence, Strengthening Institutional Self- Confidence, and Charting a Course Toward Financial Impregnability. Taylor took personally the challenge to help the college attract high-achieving students, strengthen alumni relationships, and enhance the academic reputation of Knox among other national liberal arts colleges. Taylor guided Knox through the restructuring of its educational program, the growth of student enrollment from nearly 1,000 to today's enrollment of 1,400, and an increase in alumni giving. During his tenure as president, Taylor oversaw several capital improvements to Knox's campus, including a multi-year Fitness & Athletics Initiative; the renovation of the student residence Hamblin Hall; the purchase and renovation of Borzello Hall, an academic and administrative building; and the renovation of a variety of campus facilities to enhance sustainability. Challenges did arise during his tenure, including the need for increased student housing during a time of enrollment growth; the Recession of 2008, which affected Knox's endowment value and operating costs; and questions regarding the handling by the administration of sexual misconduct cases. Yet Taylor left office known for his enthusiasm for the college's students, faculty, and alumni and for his accessibility, regularly eating lunches with students in the student union and attending cultural and athletic events. The Knox College Student Senate honored his legacy at the college by naming a new student lounge the Roger Taylor Lounge in his name. Retirement Taylor announced plans to retire as president of Knox College on April 5, 2010, and, after a national search for his successor, he officially stepped down on June 30, 2011. The Board of Trustees named Taylor professor emeritus in December 2011. When asked what he viewed as his greatest legacy at Knox, Taylor said \\"I fixed the Old Main bell.\\" Taylor and his wife, Anne, both received an Honorary Doctorate of Law from Knox College upon the celebration of their 50th Knox reunion in October 2013. In February 2016, Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner announced the appointment of Taylor to the Illinois State Museum Board. Successor His successor as president is Teresa L. Amott, Ph.D., who was Provost and Dean of the Faculty at Hobart and William Smith Colleges (HWS), in Geneva, New York, having been in that post since 2005. Prior to that, she was Vice Provost of Gettysburg College in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. She has a B.A. from Smith College and a Ph.D. from Boston College, and is an economist by training. Amott began her presidency in July 2011. Honors In 2006, Roger Taylor was named one of the nation's ten \\"Most Attractive College Presidents,\\" by \\"The Insider's Guide to the Colleges\\".

He was one of the first recorded captive manatee births, and at age 69, he was the oldest manatee in captivity, and possibly the oldest manatee in the world. Due to his hand rearing from birth, Snooty was never released to the wild and was the only manatee at the museum's aquarium that had regular human interaction. Life history Snooty and friend on his 60th birthday, July 2008 During 1948, Samuel J. Stout, owner of the Miami Aquarium and Tackle Company, acquired a permit from the State of Florida to own a single manatee, a female he had named Lady. On July 21, 1948, Lady gave birth to a male calf Stout named \\"Baby\\". Due to his permit allowing him to keep only a single manatee, he had to find a new home for the calf. Around the same time, the city of Bradenton in Manatee County wished to acquire a manatee for their 1949 De Soto Heritage Festival, and learned of the birth of Baby at the Miami Aquarium and Tackle Company. After De Soto Celebration Association member Walter Hardin acquired a permit for a manatee exhibition, the city built a tank on the municipal pier and arranged for Stout to bring Baby from Miami to Bradenton for the festival. Afterwards, Stout returned with the manatee to Miami, but Stout was still only legally allowed to keep a single manatee. In April 1949, arrangements were made to allow Baby to become a permanent resident of Bradenton's South Florida Museum, where a new round tank was completed in May for Baby. Baby began living in the tank on June 20, 1949. According to the book The Legacy: South Florida Museum, Stout arrived in Bradenton late at night and was unable to locate the museum's curator, Dr. Lester Leigh, to unlock the door, and received help from the sheriff and a group of prisoners to move Baby into his new home. The manatee remained named Baby through November 1949, after which he became known as Baby Snoots, possibly by Stout, or popularly believed to have been inspired by Fanny Brice's The Baby Snooks Show. As the manatee aged, he became known simply as Snooty. In 1966, the South Florida Aquarium moved from the Bradenton Municipal Pier to its current location, where a new, larger pool was built for Snooty. He was also granted official mascot status for Manatee County, Florida. In 1993, the museum underwent renovations, and Snooty was moved to a pool. The pool was renovated in 1998 to allow for better care for Snooty and now two more companion manatees for rehabilitation (in accordance with the Manatee Rehabilitation Network, the Sea to Shore Alliance, and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission). Since 1998, starting with Newton, the Parker Manatee Aquarium has helped in rehabilitation for 25 manatees. =Death= On July 23, 2017, two days after his 69th birthday, Snooty died as the result of drowning. A normally closed hatch door that accesses a plumbing area was open, allowing the manatees access to an unsafe area. The younger and smaller manatees were able to go in and out of the area, but due to Snooty's size, he could not return through the hatch to access air. An investigation was conducted to determine how a hatch that was normally bolted shut became open allowing access to a restricted area. The panel to the chamber where Snooty died was loose the day before his birthday. At the conclusion of the investigation, South Florida Museum released a report which determined Snooty's death had indeed been preventable and cited lapses in process and procedures that should be corrected. The Museum detailed its plans to comply with the report's recommendations and also announced that Marilyn Margold, the Director of Living Collections, no longer worked at the museum.  Details  Snooty and handler on his 63rd birthday, July 2011. The aquarium strongly discourages human interaction with manatees, but Snooty was too old to be released into the wild, and his handling was the only exception made. It had been discovered that Snooty was able to remember the voices of former keepers and remember training behaviors he learned when only one year old. Snooty had also been used in research with the Mote Marine Laboratory. In a 2006 study, it was shown that manatees such as Snooty were capable of experimental tasks much like dolphins, disproving the preconception that manatees are unintelligent. Snooty's birthday was a popular event at the South Florida Museum, the highlight of which was the presentation of a cake made of vegetables and fruits for Snooty while the visitors all sang \\"Happy Birthday\\" for him. Due to his known date of birth, Snooty is evidence for how long manatees are able to live.

He made his first appearance on 21 June 2006. Of his new role, Stuart said: \\"I am really excited about joining EastEnders and am thrilled to be working with the cast – I can’t wait to get stuck in.\\" It was announced on 15 June 2007 he would leave the show at the end of his current storyline. Laing's contract was initially for a few episodes but was soon extended to six months and stayed on for a year in total and departed on 25 June 2007. He is the husband of May Wright (Amanda Drew) and father of Dawn Swann's (Kara Tointon) daughter, Summer Swann. Rob's most notable storyline is kidnapping Dawn and handcuffing her to a bed so that his wife, May, could perform a home Caesarian in an attempt to steal her baby. This happens after Dawn fell in love with him after Rob gained her trust. The storyline prompted over 200 complaints to the BBC as well as achieving 9.3 million viewers. Police were still searching for Madeleine McCann, and the BBC had to re-write the storyline to avoid causing distress to the viewers. Storylines Rob first appears on 21 June 2006, when Victor Brown (Jimmy Yuill) introduces Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) to him at a Walford Community Charitable Trust meeting. Rob also attends a charity auction where he tries to out-bid Ian, who is bidding for a bracelet for Dawn Swann (Kara Tointon). She is posing as Ian's wife while his real wife, Jane Beale (Laurie Brett), is running the cafe that she and Ian own. After Rob raises the price, he then lets Ian buy the bracelet. Rob and Dawn start dating. He discovers \\"Jane\\" is actually Dawn but they continue to date. On 13 November 2006, it is revealed that Dr. May Wright (Amanda Drew), the new GP for Walford, is Rob's wife. Rob and May are separated, but May wants to give their marriage another chance. Rob splits with Dawn and gets back together with May, but Dawn has become pregnant with Rob's baby. Dawn plans to have an abortion, however May, who is unable to conceive, has other ideas, and Rob and May then offer to buy Dawn's baby when it is born. Dawn agrees to the deal, but when she sees Rob and May acting like the perfect couple and learns that they have been buying things for \\"their\\" baby, she makes another appointment for a termination. Again, she doesn't go through with it, thinking Rob will leave May for her. Later May suggests to Rob that he reconcile with Dawn - desperate for the baby - she insists Rob keep Dawn sweet until she is over 24 weeks and cannot have a legal termination. Dawn, however, is unhappy that Rob intends to stay with May until she has the baby. He promises Dawn that they will be a family after the birth but she doesn't believe him and tries aborting the baby herself and ends up in hospital. Rob tries talking her round but Dawn rebuffs him so he returns to May. May later tells Dawn not to stalk Rob so Rob tells May that he is leaving her for Dawn and moves out. In revenge, May reports Rob for fraudulently obtaining a credit card for \\"Jane Beale\\", the name Dawn was using when they met. His boss suspends him and later sacks him. May leaves but later invites Rob round to apologise and tries to seduce him. Trying to leave, Rob finds the nursery May has decorated, complete with a calendar set to July with \\"My baby is born\\" written on 5th. Realising May's obsession, Rob leaves after a struggle, disturbed by May's behaviour and tells Dawn that they have to leave as soon as possible. The next day, May has a black eye and people assume Rob is responsible. He insists he isn't but after Dawn sees him attack Keith Miller (David Spinx), he admits that he did hit May. Rob tells Dawn that he has a new job away from the Square and proposes again. She accepts and they go to his parents' house but May is there - the new job doesn't exist, being part of Rob and May's plan to take Dawn prisoner. They handcuff her to a bed and May injects Dawn with a sedative. Dawn tells May that she would rather let the baby die than give it to her, so May decides to deliver the baby herself by caesarean, intentionally putting Dawn's life at risk. When May leaves to get her surgical tools, Dawn tells Rob of May's plans and begs him to let her go. She manages to free herself and knocks Rob out. She stabs May with a scalpal before escaping in their car. Later, Rob returns to Albert Square to apologise to Dawn, but she threatens him and her family discover what he did to her. Rob tells them that he has had May sectioned, when she is actually waiting at home for him to call her. Dawn leaves to visit Keith and her mother, Rosie Miller (Gerry Cowper), Mickey Miller (Joe Swash) and Garry Hobbs (Ricky Groves) keep Rob hostage, torturing him by holding him down and pouring gravy on him and allowing their dog to lick him clean. While this is going on, they learn from Carly Wicks (Kellie Shirley) that Dawn went into labour on the tube but delivered baby Summer in hospital, but Rob is thrown out when he tries to go and see her. Despite Rob's pleas to forget it, May goes into the hospital posing as Dawn's GP and tries to abduct the baby, but Dawn wakes up in time and refuses to let May take her. Distraught, May runs out of the hospital and tries to run Rob down before driving away. Rob goes to the police and tells them about the surrogacy agreement they had with Dawn. He then visits Dawn and Summer and tries to propose to Dawn, but she punches him, furious that he told the police she wanted to sell her baby. Keith drags him out of the house and he is never seen again. When May returns in 2008, she reveals that Rob has left her and is now living with a new woman with whom he is expecting a baby. Creation and development =Casting= The character of Rob was originally a minor part. Laing said of his casting: \\"I originally came up for a smaller part - for four or five episodes - and then they called me back and said there was this possibility of a character they were looking to develop, which would be in it for a longer time. I don't think they knew quite where the storylines are going, but they had a faint idea of relationships that they could establish.” Laing's character, Rob, was initially six months long and his character was not very involved in the programme in his first two months. He added: \\"I'd come in and do a day every couple of weeks and the story was very slow-burning, really. The writers got their teeth into the story and started to develop more and more ideas for it and that's where it started to take off.\\" =Storyline development= Although the kidnapping of Dawn prompted 200 complaints, the BBC had already rewritten the storyline. The original storyline was for Rob and May to kidnap Dawn's baby but because of the Madeleine McCann abduction, it was rewritten. A spokeswoman for the BBC said \\"The storyline involving child abduction would be \\"inappropriate\\" and could cause distress for viewers\\". Dawn is caught in a love triangle involving her lover Rob, and his character's wife Dr. May Wright. \\"Rob is currently living with Dawn and has left his wife after she attempted to buy Dawn's unborn baby, which is fathered by Rob.\\" Executive producer Diederick Santer commented on Laing and Drew's skills for the kidnap storyline. The producer told the news website Digital Spy: \\"Dr. May and Rob - Amanda Drew and Stuart Laing - have led Dawn and the audience a merry dance this year. They have both given fantastic, gripping performances and we have loved having them. We wish them both all the best for the future.\\" Reception Dawn handcuffed to the bed by Rob and Mad May was highly criticised by viewers. The episode showing Dawn handcuffed to the bed grabbed 9.3 million viewers in total. In the episode, Rob lures Dawn out into the country so that May can handcuff her to the bed in order to give Dawn a home caesarian section. This screening prompted over 200 complaints to the BBC. Laing commented: \\"I was shocked when I read the script and my girlfriend Ali has been a bit disturbed by what I've been up to. She's enjoyed it but she's been a bit horrified at the same time! I didn't have any idea how bonkers it was going to get. [...] Rob and May were going through real problems with IVF then made some bad choices which got them spiralling into this very dark place. It's good drama and a difficult thing to pull off when it's going out at 8pm. Although we received a lot of complaints last week nobody was trying to offend people.\\" Dawn falls in love with Rob, and he uses this to get a child for May and himself. Laing admitted it was an \\"intense\\" period, and commented: \\"As an actor, you've got to find a way to get your head around it. I never thought about Rob as a villain, he's just someone who makes bad choices and digs holes he can't get out of. The very last turn, when it got so extreme, I put it down to him falling out of love with Dawn and his wife having this spell on him. [...] He justifies it to himself by thinking Dawn wants to give the baby up anyway and she was going to take money for it. I think deep down he has a conscience and there is probably a part of him which is horrified but there's no going back.\\" References External links *Rob Minter at BBC Online * EastEnders characters Fictional bankers Fictional businesspeople Television characters introduced in 2006 Male characters in television ","title":"Rob Minter"},{"id":"5021849","text":"Gerald Francis Morris Russell (12 January 1928 – 26 July 2018)Professor Gerald Russell obituary, Iron-willed psychiatrist who was the leading authority on eating disorders and will be remembered for his fascination with Rubens’nudes The Times. 22 August 2018. was a British psychiatrist.

While at London's Maudsley Hospital he met the psychiatrist Aubrey Lewis and \\"was completely won over by the way that Lewis thought about and practised psychiatry\\" and became a psychiatrist too. Career From 1971 to 1979 Russell was a professor and consultant psychiatrist at the Royal Free Hospital, London. During this time he noticed patients who were overeating followed by self-induced vomiting or using purgatives or both and a morbid fear of becoming fat which not to fit the classic description of anorexia nervosa.

Beside the resident chemical industry, the municipality is the site of the Schkopau Power Station, a brown coal power plant run by the E.ON electric utility. The municipal area comprises the localities of Burgliebenau, Döllnitz, Ermlitz, Hohenweiden, Knapendorf, Korbetha, Lochau, Luppenau, Raßnitz, Röglitz, Schkopau, and Wallendorf. History A Scapowe Castle was first mentioned in an 1177 deed. Already in the ninth century, a Carolingian fortress had been erected on the Saale River, then the eastern border of East Francia with the lands of the Polabian Slavs. In 1215, King Frederick II endowed it to the Archbishop of Magdeburg, who already held the nearby town of Halle. Enfeoffed to the Bishop of Merseburg in 1444 and held by the Trotha noble family from 1477 onwards, the castle was rebuilt several times, recently in 1876 in a Renaissance Revival style. Today it is used as a hotel. In April 1936, the Buna (i.e. butadiene-natrium polymer) synthetic rubber company was established in Schkopau, part of the Nazi efforts to make German economy self-sufficient in view of coming World War II. The Schkopau works were a subsidiary of the Leuna chemical company, itself part of the vast IG Farben industry conglomerate. Production started in 1937; beside rubber it included polyvinyl chloride (PVC), trichloroethylene, formaldehyde, tetrahydrofuran (THF), acetic acid and acetic anhydride, as well as acetone. During the war, the Schkopau plant was the greatest producer of Axis synthetic rubber (>17%). It ran the Buna Werke branch in Oświęcim, where the Monowitz concentration camp (Auschwitz III) was erected, a labor camp (Arbeitslager) with numerous forced labourers working under cruel treatment. Schkopau Buna plant, 1953 After the war, the Schkopau plant was seized by the Soviet Military Administration in Germany and re-organised as a Publicly Owned Operation (Volkseigener Betrieb, VEB) of East Germany. The VEB Chemische Werke Buna combine, the world's largest producer of carbide in 1958, became known for its Plaste und Elaste products but also for outdated production facilities and heavy industrial pollution. Taken over by the East German Treuhand agency upon the Peaceful Revolution in 1989, it is today a subsidiary of the Dow Chemical Company.

His story was recorded by his Christian contemporaries Romuald Guarna and Hugo Falcandus from Sicily and the Muslim historian Ibn Khaldun. Peter was born a Muslim in Djerba to a Berber family of the Sadwikish tribe. After his conversion he entered the service of the Sicilian crown and rose to the rank of admiral in the navy. During the reconquest of Roger I's \\"Kingdom of Africa\\" by the Muslims (1159), Peter led 160 ships in a raiding expedition to the Muslim-held Balearic Islands. He later tried to relieve besieged Mahdia in North Africa with the same fleet, but soon after engaging in battle he turned around and retreated towards Sicily. While Arabic sources credit a gale with dispersing the fleet, Hugo Falcandus asserts that Peter was \\"only in name and dress a Christian, and a Saracen at heart\\". Falcandus' assertion can probably be discredited, at least with respect to this point in Peter's life, for the admiral did not fall out of favour at court. In fact, he was promoted to the office of Great Chamberlain. In 1162, Peter replaced the deceased Count Sylvester of Marsico in the triumvirate of officials—including Matthew of Ajello and Richard Palmer—in whom the king had confided the administration of the realm since the assassination of his prime minister, Maio of Bari, in 1160. On her husband's death in 1166, the queen dowager Margaret of Navarre assumed the regency for her young son William II. She trusted neither the nobility nor the church and so turned to the palatine officials and the triumvirs, of which she did not trust Matthew of Ajello. She promoted the chief eunuch, Peter, to the highest post in the kingdom, the one formerly held by Maio of Bari, but did not grant him the latter's title \\"emir of emirs\\" (ammiratus ammiratorum). Peter was despised by the nobility and soon the Queen's cousin, Gilbert, Count of Gravina, was plotting against his life. Unable either to keep control of Sicily or to control Gilbert, Peter initially strengthened his bodyguard and eventually absconded, taking with him a quantity of treasure and severely embarrassing the Queen-regent. Re-assuming his birth name of Ahmed and practising Islam, he crossed to Africa and became a captain of the fleet of the Almohad caliph Yusuf I. According to Ibn Khaldun, who calls him Ahmed es-Sikeli (\\"Ahmed the Sicilian\\"), he fought with valour against Christian foes.

At the time of recording, the band consisted of Francis Rossi (credited on the sleeve as Mike Rossi), Rick Parfitt (credited as Ritchie Parfitt), Alan Lancaster and John Coghlan (credited as John Coughlan). March 1971 saw the new four-man lineup of the band release another non-album single: a Rossi/Young song called \\"Tune to the Music\\". The single was not a hit. The band then set to work writing and recording a new album. A couple of the songs, such as the opening track \\"Umleitung\\" (German for 'diversion') had been written as far back as 1970. In November 1971 the album was released. A single from the album, Rossi and Young's \\"Mean Girl\\", was to become a UK #20 hit some time later, in April 1973, after they had their third top ten British hit single with \\"Paper Plane\\", from their next album Piledriver. When \\"Mean Girl\\" charted, the record company decided to release another single from the album: a rerecording of \\"Gerdundula\\", the B-side to their 1970 single \\"In My Chair\\".

Today, it is a part of Leuna. Kötzschau is situated approximately 11 km southeast of Merseburg and has a population close to 2,000. Geography Location of Kötzschau in Leuna =Location= Kötzschau is located to the extreme southeast of the municipality of Leuna, and to the east of Saalekreis district and of Saxony-Anhalt. It borders directly on Markranstädt, Saxony. The Saale passes to the west. The brook flows from the southeast to the northwest through Kötzschau. At Schladebach, it is dammed to form the Speicher Schladebach. =Subdivisions= Kötzschau consists of the Ortsteile Kötzschau, , , and . History Kötzschau had its first documentary mention in 1205 (Schladebach 1012, Thalschütz 1225, Witzschersdorf 1285, Rampitz 1479). For several centuries, Kötzschau was notable mainly for the presence of a local brine spring and the use of a Saline (which in German refers to a structure employed in the boiling of brine, not to salt evaporation ponds). These were first described in the early 14th century. In 1347, during the war between the Margrave of Meissen and the Archbishop of Magdeburg, , the Saline was burned down. It was subsequently rebuilt by the Elector of Saxony. In 1597, the ' was built, a canal linking Kötzschau to the Elster Mountains to facilitate the transport of wood needed in the production of salt. The Saline was again destroyed in the Thirty Years' War but rebuilt in 1697. In 1706/7, Kötzschau was occupied by Swedish troops during the Great Northern War and the school/rectory became the main store of animal feed for the whole army. Not far away, the Treaties of Altranstädt were signed in 1706 and 1707. With the coming of the Industrial Revolution, as part of the region of Mitteldeutschland, Kötzschau was located in a centre of industrial activity. In 1798, the first steam engine of the Electorate was set up in Kötzschau, to pump up the brine. In 1856, the train station was built as a stop on the new railway line Erfurt-Leipzig. In 1861, the Saline was closed, all buildings were demolished. From 1857 to 1917, lignite was mined between Rampitz and Thalschütz. In 1886, Schladebach made international headlines as the location of the deepest-ever drilling (1,748 metres, a record that lasted until 1893). In 1892, lignite works and a lime kiln were set up. In 1930/1, the lime kiln was converted into an iron works, producing metal containers and ovens. On 5 April 1945, the Witzschersdorf late Baroque Rittergut (manor) was destroyed by Allied bombing and not rebuilt. On 1 July 1950, the Großgemeinde Kötzschau was created by merging Rampitz, Schladebach, Thalschütz and Witzschersdorf to Kötzschau. From 2006 to 2009, Kötzschau was a member of the municipal association Leuna-Kötzschau. Since 31 December 2009/1 January 2010, the village has been a part of the municipality Leuna.

The nickname was passed on to George Tirebiter's subsequent successors after the original Tirebiter's death in 1950. The original Tirebiter was a nationally known figure and beloved canine of the University of Southern California. He would lead the marching band out at home football games and once even entered in an armored car. Tirebiter was kidnapped, or thought to have been kidnapped, multiple times by the University of Southern California's rival the University of California, Los Angeles, USC student politicians for publicity, and once possibly by a newspaper. The line of Tirebiters lasted through 1961 when the legacy of the Tirebiter mascots was replaced with Traveler, the white Andalusian horse ridden by a Trojan rider at USC home football games and various other university events. Origins There exists a wide range of possible stories for Tirebiter's origin. One claims that a stray dog was discovered by a group of USC students at Currie's Ice Cream parlor and that one student remarked that the dog looked like a Navy V-12 student named George Kuhns. Thus, the dog was dubbed \\"George\\". Another story was that the dog was the pet of a local couple and that he was initially named \\"Leo\\". When the couple split the dog was abandoned before being adopted by a local woman, Ann Schreiber. She was supposedly a great lover of dogs who wanted to provide for the lost dog. She named him \\"George\\" due to the resemblance he bore to a friend of hers. Another origin story was claimed by Dan Schiavone, president of the Trojan Knights, on the occasion of a memorial ceremony honoring Tirebiter on September 21, 1950. Schiavone claimed that Tirebiter was a K-9 police dog that was discarded from the program and subsequently found as a stray on USC's campus. However, the veracity of this account is somewhat in question due to the context of the speech and this being the singular mention of such an origin. He received the surname \\"Tirebiter\\" because he would bite at the tires of cars he chased down Trousdale Parkway, which bisects the campus. (Today Trousdale is only open to foot traffic.) George Tirebiter I The first George Tirebiter was for a period of around six years the unofficial mascot of USC. He was notable for chasing down passing cars and nipping at their wheels. The lovable shaggy mutt quickly endeared himself to the student body. He was pampered by the fraternities and sororities in USC's Greek community, routinely being carried back and forth from campus and being fed ice cream. In 1947, the student body urged the student government to designate George Tirebiter as the official mascot of USC. In an elaborate celebration involving a parade of 30 cars, a marching band, and campus celebrities, George Tirebiter was crowned the official mascot of the University of Southern California on October 22, 1947. Shortly after his coronation as official mascot, George Tirebiter was kidnapped by UCLA students on October 30, 1947. He was taken from USC's campus and sedated. Then the UCLA students shaved the letters U-C-L-A into the fur on Tirebiter's back. To take the prank one step further they took Tirebiter by the Los Angeles Times to be photographed for the paper. After this ordeal, Tirebiter was finally returned to USC in a \\"doped and confused\\" state. Once he became the official mascot, the Trojan Knights became his handler at campus events and football games. At football games, Tirebiter would be led out onto the field with the marching band and for the length of the game stand in front of the student rooting section. George became further endeared to the student body when he bit the University of California Los Angeles mascot Joe Bruin on the nose at a home football game and chased after Oski, the Golden Bear mascot of the University of California Berkeley, at another home game. In 1948, Tirebiter got into trouble with city health officials because of two incidents of biting people and his semi-stray status. The city presented an ultimatum to USC. They required that someone or some organization assume responsibility and ownership for the dog or he would be turned into the pound. In the wake of these events on September 29, 1948, the Trojan Knights decided that they would take responsibility for Tirebiter's housing, food, ownership, legal liability, and transportation. After assuming responsibility for the dog, the Trojan Knights built a doghouse on Bovard Field for him. Due to Tirebiter's loud barking and his proximity to classrooms, numerous professors complained about the noise and disruption he caused. One professor actually proposed that one student should always be on \\"Tirebiter duty\\" to pet the dog and make sure he did not disrupt class. Throughout Tirebiter's time as USC's unofficial and official mascot, many people attempted to describe what kind of dog Tirebiter could possibly be. The most common characterization was that he was merely a pound mutt. Other attempts, even by canine experts, had similarly underwhelming conclusions. A zoology professor described him as \\"sort of an Airedale Terrier,\\" but conceded that \\"it would take another 100 years of breeding to produce another George.\\" In 1949, Tirebiter's already surly nature began to get worse. The Trojan Knights decided to place him in the care of a local animal shelter with the hopes that he would recover. However, his condition did not improve. In early 1950, he no longer even recognized or acknowledged his caretakers. Eddy and George Prussell, former presidents of the Trojan Knights, conferred with Dean of Students Bernard L. Hyink to decide on a solution. They decided to send him to the farm of Bill Hubbard, a Trojan alumnus, in El Centro, California, for the summer so that the dog could recover. Sadly, sometime during June 1950, Tirebiter was run over by a passing car on the farm and killed. For the next three months, however, this news was not disseminated to the public. It was not until September 19, 1950, that Tirebiter's fate was known. A Daily Trojan writer routinely asked Dan Schiavone, the president of the Trojan Knights, \\"How's Tirebiter getting along?\\" Schiavone responded matter-of-factly, \\"He's dead.\\" This news was then broken on September 20, 1950, by the Daily Trojan with the full page headline \\"Tirebiter is Dead!\\" The student body then planned a memorial ceremony for Tirebiter on September 22, 1950. The ceremony was led by Schiavone and consisted of a parade of convertibles with black bunting, a marching band, and the student body. Upon reaching Tirebiter's cement footprints, immortalized during Tirebiter's coronation in 1947, a memorial wreath was laid and a trumpeter played \\"Taps\\" as the campus said farewell to its beloved canine mascot. Successors =Search for a successor= The day before the memorial ceremony for Tirebiter I, plans were already being made to find a successor of some sort for the mascot. A ballot was printed in the Daily Trojan with choices of \\"George Jr. , Other Animal, Statue of George, or Other Object.\\". Nominations of all sorts began to pour in from the student body. Through one day of voting, Delta Tau Delta's pedigreed boxer \\"Sully\\" led the voting. Behind him were the Trojan Knights's proposed successor \\"George Jr.\\", who they claimed was Tirebiter I's son, and the Acacia fraternity's bulldog \\"Pythagoras.\\" In addition to these early leaders, a variety of other canines and memorials were proposed. On September 25, 1950, Acacia decided to withdraw Pythagoras from the campaign. Don Gibbs, the fraternity president, explained, \\"We do not feel that a fraternity-owned dog would make a good mascot because of the competition between fraternities. A true mascot must have the complete backing of the entire student body in promoting school athletic spirit. Therefore, we are withdrawing 'Pythagoras'.\\" Additionally on September 25, it was announced that \\"Hector the Horse\\", a spotted Palomino horse had been entered into the race by the Trovets, a spirit and service organization. Floyd McCann, president of the Trovets, claimed, \\"We feel that Hector the Trojan Horse is a much more dignified and appropriate symbol of SC tradition than some dog. George was a character in his own right and voluntarily adopted the Trojans. But we don't believe he can be replaced by draft methods.\\" This quote, now seems quite prescient in light of USC's adopting its iconic mascot Traveler (mascot) in 1961. On September 26, it became a showdown between \\"George Tirebiter II\\" and \\"Hector the Trojan Horse\\" after the withdrawal of Sully, the Delta Tau Delta boxer. Although Hector was leading by a slim margin of 36 votes, possible financial problems with Hector were reported by the Daily Trojan. They calculated that it would be considerably more expensive to have an equine mascot than a canine mascot. This was due to Hector not being owned by USC, but rather being rented from a nearby stable. On September 28, it was announced that George Tirebiter II would be the official successor to Tirebiter I. The final vote in the student body senate was guided by Tirebiter II's victory in the Daily Trojan student poll 800 votes to Hector's 518. It is a remarkable increase in voting in one day that finally decided the winner. Tirebiter II's candidacy was most likely aided by the financial questions relating to Hector's ownership and upkeep. =Tirebiter II= George Tirebiter II was named the official mascot on September 28, 1950. He made his official debut at a football spirit rally for the USC-Iowa game on September 29. Statue In 2006, USC unveiled a statue celebrating the mascot's memory. The life-size statue portrays George Tirebiter II (although he is often mistaken for George Tirebiter I) with a small piece of chewed tire and is located at the south end of campus on Trousdale Parkway between the Mudd Hall of Philosophy and the Leventhal School of Accounting. George is facing Exposition Park and the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum: the home stadium for USC Trojans football. During \\"Troy Week\\", the week before the annual rivalry football game against UCLA, the Trojan Knights, with the help of USC facilities management, erect a cardinal and gold doghouse around the statue to protect it from possible vandalism. The plaque on the statue reads:Davis, Michael. \\"George Tirebiter.\\" http://www.publicartinla.com/USCArt/tirebiter.html Cultural references The protagonist of the Firesign Theatre album Don't Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers was named George Leroy Tirebiter, after the dog, and that album's movie-within-a-play, High School Madness featured a boy named Porgy Tirebiter.

Early life He was born in 1732 in New York City in a house built by his grandfather, Stephen De Lancey. This house later became famous and known as Fraunces Tavern. He had two sisters, Martha and Susan De Lancey, who did not marry. James was sent abroad for his education, first to Eton, and, in 1750, to his father's college, Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. Career Following the footsteps of his father, he was admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1753, where he pursued his studies in law in company with other wealthy provincials who found this method of legal education more attractive than a pedestrian apprenticeship to a colonial attorney at home. However, he never practiced law. =French and Indian War= First, the French and Indian War broke out immediately upon his return to America, so upon leaving the university he entered the army, reaching the rank of captain. He is said to have served aide to James Abercrombie in the Lake George campaign of 1758 and was involved in the capture of Fort Niagara in 1759.The Magazine of History: With Notes and Queries, Volumes 3-4, page 189 His military activities ended with the death of his father. The news of his father's death on July 30, 1760, reached him after he had left Oswego in the vanguard of the army headed for Crown Point. This left James with the responsibilities of the headship of one of the wealthiest and most powerful families of the provincial aristocracy. De Lancey was, with the possible exception of Frederick Philipse, the wealthiest man in the Province of New York, and for a number of years devoted himself to increasing his landed properties. During his young manhood in England, he acquired the sporting tastes of the period. After obtaining his great property he imported what are said to have been the first English race-horses, or thoroughbreds ever brought to New York. After a few years he assembled the largest and most select stud and stable of running horses in the colony if not the whole country. He was said to have been the \\"Father of the New York Turf.\\" His chief opponent in racing and politics was Lewis Morris Jr., who was later a signer of the Declaration of Independence.Flick page 198 =Political career= His responsibilities as head of the family comprehended not only the development of the extensive De Lancey estates and the conduct of the family mercantile business, but also the continuation of the political influence of the De Lancey interest. At first, the political fortunes of the De Lancey family suffered a decline under James Jr., who lacked his father's dominant official position and his powerful influence in London. At the Assembly elections in 1761, the Livingstons triumphed, but only temporarily, for in the decade following James De Lancey skillfully strengthened his own influence and that of his party. =De Lancey Political Party= Although a leader of the court party, James De Lancey won favor with the general public by his opposition to the Stamp Act, but he was opposed to the use of mob violence to protest British measures and alarmed at the increasing activity of the unenfranchised. Apparently, De Lancey's position at the time of the Stamp Act left him in good standing with the masses. The De Lancey party won the city delegation to the Assembly in 1768, James receiving the second highest number of votes of the group, which defeated the Whig lawyer combination. The De Lancey's preferred the more conservative, traditional methods of opposition to the British Law: non-importation and a boycott of violators of the non- importation agreement. The De Lancey's thus sided with the prevailing merchant desire to keep the artisans from developing the clout they had wielded in the Stamp Act crisis. However, in October 1769 the De Lancey's committee came under attack from the artisan community. The De Lancey's support declined even more when the De Lancey controlled Assembly passed a special tax to raise funds to implement the Quartering Act. The De Lancey's were aware that by passing the tax they would probably lose their earlier artisan support, but trade had declined to an alarming point and there was little available currency. James De Lancey was a member of the New York committee of Correspondence, which in 1774 sent a letter to Edmund Burke protesting against the acts of the British government. De Lancey acknowledged the authority of the acts of Parliament not contrary to the rights of Englishmen, but he denied the right to tax without consent. =Flight to England= As late as April 1, 1775, he was put on a committee to correspond with other colonies, but by this time the masses had little confidence in the De Lancey controlled Assembly. Realizing that his influence in the province had been virtually destroyed, he left the colony in April of that year, following the Battle of Lexington; journeying via Fort Stanwix to Canada, he sailed for England in May 1775.Johnson and Brown. The Twentieth Century Biographical Dictionary of Notable Americans, 1904. Until the evacuation of the city, he could still live in comfort from the rents his Lower East Side tenants continued to pay. De Lancey took steps at once to realize as much money as he could from his holdings while the British still held New York. In 1780, he appointed his brother-in-law and his attorneys to sell his New York holdings. From the year of the passage of the Act of Attainder, De Lancey's income, now greatly curtailed, was supplemented by a grant of £200 a year from the British Treasury. Of total claims for compensation amounting to £56,781, De Lancey was finally paid £29,842, second only to Frederick Philipse in awards made to New Yorkers.Flick page 203. De Lancey's impressive social connections stamped him as a natural leader of the Loyalist cause in England. Throughout his later days, De Lancey continued to frequent the highest social circles abroad. As late as 1791, James Rivington addressed him \\"at Lord Southampton's Westminster.Flick, Alexander Clarence. New York History: Quarterly Journal of the New York State Historical Association, 1999, Volume 80; Volume 97, page 205 Personal life On August 19, 1771, De Lancey was married to Margaret Allen, daughter of Chief Justice Allen of Pennsylvania. Together, they were the parents of five children who survived him: * Charles Stephen De Lancey (d. 1840), who served in the Royal Navy and did not marry. * Margaret De Lancey, who in 1794 married Sir Juckes Granville Juckes-Clifton (1769–1852), the High Sheriff of Montgomeryshire.Dyott's diary, 1781-1845: a selection from the journal of William Dyott, sometime general in the British army and aide-de- camp to His Majesty King George III. A. Constable, 1907 Retrieved on 23 September 2008. * Ann De Lancey, who never married. * Susan De Lancey (d. 1866), who never married. * James De Lancey (d. 1857), a Lieutenant-Colonel in the First Dragoon Guard who also did not marry. None of the five had children. There are speculations with supporting evidence of tombstone inscriptions that De Lancey had a previous union with a connection of the Livingston family. Only her Christian name, Mary, is known. She died in 1770 leaving three children—John, James, and Mary. Through funds; believed to have been indirectly provided by the latter from his London exile, these children were reared and educated. De Lancey's death at Bath, England, is recorded in The Gentleman's Magazine for April 8, 1800.Flick page 193 =The De Lancey Estates= James De Lancey built himself a mansion north of Broadway and Thames Street, a large brick edifice with a semicircular driveway leading through a row of magnificent shade trees, an outstanding feature of his extensive estate. The house fronted the Bowery and stood near the present site of Christie Street between De Lancey and Rivington Streets. The interior of the house compared in lavishness of appointment with the residences of wealthy Londoners of the day and the more costly Williamsburg, Virginia, mansions. To the rear, the house looked out upon a formal garden—a showplace of the town. The East and West De Lancey Farms ran from the Bowery, facing the Bayard Estates, to the East River and from Division Street north to Stanton Street, where they bordered the lands of Pierre Van Cortlandt, Peter Stuyvesant, and Messrs Bayard, Watts, and Rutgers. When, in 1765 his sister Ann married the judge and Loyalist historian, Thomas Jones. James De Lancey gave them a two- acre estate known as \\"Mount Pitt,\\" at the highest part of Grand Street. The rentals from this lower East Side property made up the chief part of De Lancey's income, which he invested in the acquisition of numerous other parcels of real estate. Fifteen years of accumulation added to his holdings a thirty-acre farm at Bloomingdale, running from the southern boundary of Central Park to the North River. With his boyhood friend James Duane, he was one of the Socialborough Proprietors, holding an area obtained by grant in 1771 and located on both sides of Otter Creek in the present towns of Pittsford and Rutland, Vermont.Flick page 197 He had large holdings in the Minisink Patent, a grant so worded as to extend far into New Jersey, and considerable acreage in Northampton County, Pennsylvania. He also had extensive properties in the Cherry Valley area and at other points in Albany County, notably Canajoharie and Hosack, and in Tryon County, including Mohawk Valley lands. Some of these he conveyed to his brother-in-law, John Watts, in 1765. The estate of James De Lancey is often regarded as a classic illustration of the democratic effects of the Revolution, as his East Side property alone was repurchased from the Commissioners by some 275 owners. =De Lancey Horse-racing= On First Street stood De Lancey's stables, on Second Street a paddock for the horses, and nearby a private track to train them. From Wildair, Lath, and Cub Mare, imported by De Lancey, were descended most of the great race horses of America prior to the Civil War. De Lancey was not content with entering his racers at the local tracks—at the Church Farm, or the Newmarket on Hempstead Plain, and at Harlem—although in these local contests he faced stiff competition from Lewis Morris. In 1769 his horse Lath came in the winner of the £100 purse at the Center Course at Philadelphia, and on another occasion, in a race in Maryland, he lost a half-bushel of silver dollars when a horse bearing the Dulany colors came in ahead of his entry. It is significant that one of the earliest resolves of the Continental Congress was one urging that, in view of the approaching conflict, horse-racing be discontinued. When De Lancey left America in 1775 he sold out his entire stable.Flick page 198. References ;Notes ;Sources *Garraty, John Arthur, Kenneth T. Jackson, Edward T.

She was a Casco-class, light-draft monitor intended for service in the shallow bays, rivers, and inlets of the Confederacy. These warships sacrificed armor plate for a shallow draft and were fitted with a ballast compartment designed to lower them in the water during battle. Design revisions Though the original designs for the Casco-class monitors were drawn by John Ericsson, the final revision was created by Chief Engineer Alban C. Stimers following Rear Admiral Samuel F. Du Pont's failed bombardment of Fort Sumter in 1863. By the time that the plans were put before the Monitor Board in New York, NY, Ericsson and Stimers had a poor relationship, and Chief of the Bureau of Construction and Repair John Lenthall l had little connection to the board. This resulted in the plans being approved and 20 vessels ordered without serious scrutiny of the new design. $14 million US was allocated for the construction of these vessels. It was discovered that Stimers had failed to compensate for the armor his revisions added to the original plan and this resulted in excessive stress on the wooden hull frames and a freeboard of only 3 inches. Stimers was removed from the control of the project and Ericsson was called in to undo the damage. He was forced to raise the hulls of the monitors under construction by 22 inches to make them seaworthy. Fate As a result, the Cohoes was laid up at League Island Navy Yard, in 1867. Her name was changed to Charybdis on 15 June 1869 and back to Cohoes on 19 August 1869. She was sold in July 1874.

(At the time, the transportation center of Utica was the intellectual capital of western New York.) A graduate with honors from Union College in 1814, he attended Princeton Theological Seminary but withdrew because of poor health (dyspepsia). \\"After a brief term of service in the Female Missionary Society, Gale received his ordination in the St. Laurence Presbytery, and settled down to preach in...the Burned Over District.\\" He \\"was not a gifted speaker\\". His first assignment was as missionary to settlements on the shore of Lake Ontario, followed by a pastorate in Adams, New York. Oneida Institute of Science and Industry In 1824, Gale, again troubled by dyspepsia, traveled to the southern United States, visiting Georgetown College, Hampden-Sydney College, and Central College (later the University of Virginia); he disapproved of Thomas Jefferson's decision to remove religion from the university's operation. Gale bought a farm in Western, New York, and started an experiment \\"teaching some young men who proposed to prepare themselves to preach the Gospel\\", the 7 young men paying him through their labor. This successful experiment would be the start in the United States of the manual labor college. Among the students there was Charles Finney, a lawyer who, through Gale's efforts, found a new faith in Christ and undertook to become a Christian minister.Memoirs, Conversion to ChristMemoirs, Beginning of His WorkMemoirs, His Doctrinal Education and Other Experiences at Adams In 1827 Gale went on to found the Oneida Institute of Science and Industry in Whitesboro, New York, an institution with a strong religious component, incorporating manual labor as a means by which students could pay for their education and simultaneously receive the spiritual (psychological) and physical benefits of exercise. Most of the Western students followed him there. Although the details are not known (\\"the reasons are not clearly apparent\\" ), Gale was not effective as the Institute's leader; he described his own status as \\"straitened\\". He was \\"too indifferent to money to handle it carefully or account for it consistently.\\" He asked to be replaced in 1831, and his replacement, Beriah Green, \\"for whom Gale had nothing but scorn\\", took over in 1833, finding that Gale had left the school with significant indebtedness. The philanthropist brothers and benefactors of Oneida Lewis and Arthur Tappan sought a new manual labor school to support, hiring in 1832 one of Gale's students, Theodore Weld, to find a suitable location. Weld recommended the new Lane Theological Seminary, in Cincinnati. In a highly public incident Gale never refers to, a group of about 24 students, led by Weld, moved there from Oneida, complaining mysteriously about \\"the lack of theological classes\\". Finding Lane unhospitable to their abolitionism, they left en masse for the new Oberlin. Both Lane and Oberlin were barely functioning before the arrival of the Oneida contingent. Knox College By far the best-known part of Gale's life, since original documents are available and Gale spoke and wrote of it several times, is his years at Knox College. In 1833–1834, in Whitesboro, the unemployed Gale drew up the plans and recruited supporters for yet another manual labor college, further west. A scouting party (a \\"committee\\") found fertile, well-situated land available in Illinois. In 1836 \\"more than 30 families\\", most from the Utica–Troy Mohawk River region of upstate New York, accompanied him to found Galesburg, Illinois, named for him, and in 1837 the Knox Manual Labor College (later Knox College, site of one of the famous Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858). Gale became a professor of rhetoric and moral philosophy at Knox.

She is best known for having written the novels The Kingdom of Little Wounds, Mirabilis, and Breath and Bones, along with short stories, literary and pop- culture criticism, and book reviews. The Kingdom of Little Wounds won a Printz silver medal from the American Library Association in 2014. Cokal contributed short stories to anthologies and journals including Prairie Schooner, Hayden's Ferry Review, Bellevue Literary Review, The Cincinnati Review, and Ohio State University's The Journal. She also contributed essays about contemporary writers to Critique, Scandinavian Studies, Texas Studies in Literature and Language, Style, Broad Street Magazine, and The Centennial Review. She has reviewed almost four dozen books for the New York Times Book Review and has contributed reviews and essays to numerous other reviewing organs. Cokal was once an assistant professor of creative writing and modern literature at California Polytechnic State University and is currently an associate professor at Virginia Commonwealth University. The range of her interests can be seen in her contributions to the St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture on abortion, supermodels, Kate Moss, and zoos. She teaches literature of the last 150 years with an international perspective, often featuring Vladimir Nabokov (whom she has called one of her literary idols), Colette, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Knut Hamsun, Marcel Proust, Patrick Süskind, Sarah Waters, Laura Ingalls Wilder, Jeanette Winterson, Virginia Woolf, and magic-realist authors such as Carlos Fuentes, Gabriel García Márquez, Louise Erdrich, Gina Nahai, and Winterson. Fiction Some of the inspiration for Cokal's first novel, Mirabilis, \\"came from the year I lived in Poitiers, France. In between studying medieval art and history, I used to sneak into a decrepit medieval church whose nave was open to the sky. That church (renamed) is where Mirabilis begins. I wrote about a wet nurse because I'm fascinated with the idea that no matter how 'civilized' we've become, we still need this very primal function; also, wet nursing was the more honorable way for a woman to make a living from her body.\\" Cokal's first novel, Mirabilis is set in the fourteenth century in Villeneuve, France. Its protagonist is a wet nurse whose breasts provide an unending supply of milk. Reviewing the book for the Gay & Lesbian Review Worldwide, Joy Parks commented, \\"Mirabilis is original, humorous, and fascinatingly bizarre, an enigmatic story wrapped in a gauze of feminine sensuality.\\" In The New York Times, Sudip Bose wrote, \\"Cokal's prose is vivid, and she is adept at scenes ... that recreate a distant and terrifying world.\\" The book's (fictional) endnotes about the settings and characters were convincing enough that many readers presumed the book was based on real incidents. They are, however, fictional. Cokal's second novel, Breath and Bones, was released by Unbridled Books in 2005 (a paperback edition was released in 2006). It is a comic picaresque whose protagonist, an artists' model and muse named Famke (an old Swedish word meaning \\"girl of good family\\" or \\"girl who stays at home\\"), travels the western United States in the 1880s. Humor, sexuality and Cokal's vivid writing abound. Reviews, while overall positive, were more mixed than for Mirabilis; though Cokal intended the book to be a picaresque romp rooted in careful research,http://www.susanncokal.net/#!belief-past--breath-and-bones/ctx3 some critics wanted the book to be more realistic. Wrote The New York Times: \\"Cokal's storytelling blends the morbid and the titillating with imaginative exuberance. ... It brings to mind the question Martin Amis asked of Lolita: how was it possible to limit her adventures to this 300-page blue streak -- to something so embarrassingly funny, so unstoppably inspired, so impossibly racy? Cokal's third novel, The Kingdom of Little Wounds, was published in fall 2013 by Candlewick Press and (in the UK and Australia) Walker Books. In the novel, women's bodies are the battlefields for court intrigue involving marriage and medicine during the Renaissance. The novel received glowing endorsements and reviews. Gregory Maguire, author of Wicked and other novels, wrote for the book's cover, “Brazen, baroque, The Kingdom of Little Wounds plots coordinates of history, fever, and magic in such a way that each is occasionally disguised as the other. However, there's no disguising Susann Cokal's immediate rise to eminence as a pantocrator of new realms. I lived in her controversial kingdom for only a week, but I suspect and hope I shall never recover.” Kirkus Reviews noted its gritty nature and frank portrayal of attitudes toward the body, especially pertaining to women, and gave it a starred review--\\"mesmerizing.\\" The book also received starred reviews from Publishers Weekly,http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-7636-6694-1 which named it one of the best books of the year for young adults, and School Library Journal. Booklist praised \\"the book’s lyrical writing, enthralling characters, and compelling plot.https://www.buffalolib.org/vufind/Record/1919038/Reviews\\" In January 2014 the American Library Association awarded The Kingdom of Little Wounds a Michael L. Printz Award Honor as one of the year's best works of literature for young readers. The Printz awards committee said of the book: \\"Impeccably researched and darkly disturbing, this complex literary tale reveals the sordid side of palace life in a 16th century Scandinavian kingdom where the royal family, the Lunedies, is cursed by a mysterious illness, and political machinations cast doubt on who will rule.\\"http://www.ala.org/yalsa/2014-michael-l-printz-winners The paperback came out in spring 2016. Other writings Though novels are her primary focus, Cokal has achieved some note as a short story writer, pop culture analyst, and literary scholar. She is especially interested in Barbie and has written several short stories about people swept up in the culture of Mattel's best-known toy. She also wrote an essay, \\"Making Friends with Midge,\\" analysing the ways in which Barbie's relationship with her ever-remodelled best friend, Midge, reflects and informs American styles of female friendship.http://broadstreetonline.org/2015/04/weekend-reading-making- friends-with-midge/ That essay received a Pushcart Prize special mention. A story involving the TV show The Price Is Right was published in The Los Angeles Review.http://www.susanncokal.net/#!underneath-it-all-theres- carpeting-/c1vf After a traumatic head injury in 2012 destroyed her memory and some of her ability with language, Cokal wrote an essay on the experience for Hayden's Ferry Review.http://haydensferryreview.blogspot.com/2012/07/contributor-spotlight- susann-cokal.html As she noted on her website in 2016, she never fully recovered from the concussion, which left her with severe chronic migraines and \\"a great blank in which I remember only a few bad things\\" for 2012.http://www.susanncokal.net/#!essays/c6gw She has published a variety of scholarly essays in academic journals and anthologies, many of which combine her interests in comparative literature, disease, pop culture, and the female body. She is fluent in French and Danish and often highlights influential world literature that has been overlooked in an English-dominated American canon. These publications include articles on tuberculosis and metaphor in nineteenth-century Scandinavian novels, French philosopher and novelist Georges Bataille; \\"The Ergonomics of Feminine Space in The Sopranos,\\" which appeared in Considering David Chase; \\"The Visual Aesthetics of Hygiene, Hot Sex, and Hair Removal\\" in POP-porn; and \\"Caught in the Wrong Story: Psychoanalysis and Narrative Structure in Tender Is the Night,\\" a frequently cited article about F. Scott Fitzgerald's narrative form. She has also written about classic children's authors such as Zilpha Keatley Snyder and Edward Eager for Rain Taxi. A professor of literature and creative writing, Cokal has published tips for aspiring writers on her website, noting \\"Great stories give the reader an experience, a sense of events unfolding over time and coming to some kind of conclusion (or a hint that a conclusion is in the offing). In some sense, fiction is didactic, too, for in an emotionally stirring way, it shows the reader something significant about life. You may break some rules, but in general it is wise to guard a few precepts in thy memory.\\" She says first of all to \\"Write something important.\\" http://www.susanncokal.net/#!advice-for-writers/c212d Works Books * Mermaid Moon (novel), Candlewick Press (Boston), 2020 * The Kingdom of Little Wounds (novel), Candlewick Press (Boston), 2013 * Mirabilis (novel), PenguinPutnam / Blue Hen (New York, NY), 2001 * Breath and Bones (novel), Unbridled Books (Denver, CO), 2005 References   External links 2014 Printz awards * Interview on TheLaughingLesbian.com Living people 21st-century American novelists Virginia Commonwealth University faculty California Polytechnic State University faculty American historical novelists American women novelists 21st-century American women writers Women historical novelists Year of birth missing (living people) Novelists from Virginia ","title":"Susann Cokal"},{"id":"5022117","text":"Petra de Steur Petra Maria de Steur, also known as La Sakhra (born 20 June 1972 in Ghent) is a Belgian singer who has taken part in several Belgian National Finals for the Eurovision Song Contest:Showbizsiteeurosong.be * 1993.- Ga door (Go on) (10th) * 1999.- Diep in mijn huid (Deep in my skin) (6th) * 2000.- Rêve (Dream) As a backing singer of Gerlando (9th) * 2006.- Wonderland As La Sakhra (2nd) * 2014.- \\"Killer Touch\\" (4th in semi-final 1) References External links 1972 births Living people Belgian female singers People from East Flanders 21st-century Belgian singers 21st-century women singers ","title":"Petra de Steur"},{"id":"5022120","text":"Weida-Land is a Verbandsgemeinde (\\"collective municipality\\") in the Saalekreis district, in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany.

T. Hambleton & Co., Cincinnati, OH, under subcontract with Alexander Swift & Co., also of Cincinnati, OH. She was delivered to the Navy on 6 May 1866 but was never commissioned and saw no service. Klamath was a Casco-class, light-draft monitor intended for service in the shallow bays, rivers, and inlets of the Confederacy. These warships sacrificed armor plate for a shallow draft and were fitted with a ballast compartment designed to lower them in the water during battle. Design revisions Though the original designs for the Casco-class monitors were drawn by John Ericsson, the final revision was created by Chief Engineer Alban C. Stimers following Rear Admiral Samuel F. Du Pont's failed bombardment of Fort Sumter in 1863. By the time that the plans were put before the Monitor Board in New York City, Ericsson and Stimers had a poor relationship, and the Chief of the Bureau of Construction and Repair, John Lenthall, had little connection to the board. This resulted in the plans being approved and 20 vessels ordered without serious scrutiny of the new design. $14 million US was allocated for the construction of these vessels. It was discovered that Simers had failed to compensate for the armor his revisions added to the original plan and this resulted in excessive stress on the wooden hull frames and a freeboard of only 3 inches. Stimers was removed from the control of the project and Ericsson was called in to undo the damage. He was forced to raise the hulls of the monitors under construction by 22 inches to make them seaworthy. Fate As a result, she was laid up at Mound City, IL. She was renamed Harpy 15 June 1869, but was changed back to Klamath 10 August of that same year. She was moved to New Orleans, LA in 1870, and sold at auction there to Schickels, Harrison & Co. 12 September 1874.

Substrate choice of territorial male Topeka shiners (Notropis topeka) in the absence of sunfish (Lepomis sp.). Ecology of Freshwater Fish 2009: 18: 350–359. Spawning patterns are similar to those of other sunfish. Due to the wide distribution of this fish, the species is not endangered and management plans are almost nonexistent presently. The orangespotted sunfish has been introduced to many habitats, such as rivers in Florida, Alabama, Texas, Colorado, Michigan, and Canada. Geographic distribution In North America, this species is common in many places; it ranges from the Great Lakes to Hudson Bay, from the Mississippi River down to the Gulf Coast and in the Colorado River from Alabama to Texas. Some studies find that, in general, orangespotted sunfish tend to live in turbid, long, large lakes, which is evident by its geographic distribution.Timmermann, T.R., Dolan, C.R., Chick, J.H. 2011. Assessment of backwater lake management strategies based on the diets of five riverine fishes, Journal of Freshwater Ecology, 26:2, 203-216.

An Annotated Checklist of the Freshwater Fishes of Texas, with Keys to Identification of Species, 2nd Edition. Texas Academy of Science. Ecology The orangespotted sunfish prefers to reside in shallow, silt-laden waters such as floodplain pools,Kwak, T.J. 1988. Lateral movement and use of floodplain habitat by fishes of the Kankakee River, Illinois, Illinois Natural History Survey, Aquatic Biology Section or waters with fine substrates such as sand. As species of the fish age and develop, they explore new territories and expand their ecological limits through migration. The dominant prey of orangespotted sunfish includes insects, such as corixids and chironomids, zooplankton, other small invertebrates that live in the water column, and fish. Though orangespotted sunfish can be found in different parts of a lake, their prey items do not vary much throughout the lake compared to other sunfish species. If reared in an environment with altered prey availability, the species has been found to show phenotypic plasticity or morphological differences in response to this changed environmental condition.Hegrenes, S. 2001. Diet-induced phenotypic plasticity of feeding morphology in the orangespotted sunfish, Lepomis humilis, Ecology of Freshwater fish 2001: 10, 35-42. Certain prey types require different methods of prey capture, so as the orangespotted sunfish develop, their body can be more elongated with an angled snout, or more deep- bodied with a blunt snout, depending on the prey type. Life history Orangespotted sunfish breed once or twice in June and July, like most other sunfish, in colonies in shallow water near shore. Floodplain and backwater areas are known to include important spawning and nursery sites for orangespotted sunfish. Its reproductive classification is a lithopelagophil, which means the fish spawn on gravel and the embryos are pelagic. Orangespotted sunfish nesting areas are often geographically close by other species’ areas and easily become crowded, which can increase the incidence of hybridization with other Lepomis. Other fish species, such as Topeka shiners (Notropis topeka), are said to be ‘nest associates’ of orangespotted and other sunfishes, meaning they establish spawning territories on the periphery of sunfish nests. This is because nesting sunfish have been known to expose suitable spawning sites for other species, like the Topeka shiner, by fanning the spot with their caudal fins to aerate the eggs. Some sunfish species make courtship sounds to attract females. For instance, when nesting orangespotted sunfish males see a female, they make grunting sounds while rushing back and forth between the female and the nest repeatedly to try to win her. The amplitude and frequency of the courtship sounds of orangespotted sunfish are distinct to the species and can be differentiated by female listeners from the sounds of other sunfish species if they do not occur simultaneously. Orangespotted sunfish have a maximum age between four and seven years, an average length of , and can reach a maximum recorded length of about . Current management The floodplain environment is easily subject to change, by natural or human activities. In many habitats that are natural homes to orangespotted sunfish, connectivity between rivers and lakes has been altered and flooding incidents have been reduced for agricultural gain. The orangespotted sunfish is one of many species that are characteristic to floodplain lakes and has been affected by the degradation of this system. The flat nature of floodplain lake areas makes agricultural runoff and runoff from manufacturers a distinct problem to water quality. Inputs from runoff can increase sedimentation, which has many detrimental effects to habitats, such as reduced oxygen concentration and lake eutrophication, a nutrient enrichment of lake water from runoff. Fortunately for orangespotted sunfish, a species that thrives in turbid, shallow systems with low oxygen content, increased sedimentation is not decreasing their habitat, though the changes may be fragmenting the habitat. In Canada, according to the Fisheries Act, this and all fish species are required to be protected for spawning, nursery, and residence habitat through proper species management. Currently, studies have used many methods to assess orangespotted sunfish population assemblages such as traps of plastic netting, pulsed DC electrofishing, tandem fyke and mini- fyke nets. Management recommendations This species is not as vulnerable to human-induced change as most freshwater fish. The orangespotted sunfish lives in lakes largely surrounded by agricultural areas, so collaboration between managers, farmers and other watershed managing organizations in the region is necessary. Watershed disorders, such as increased sedimentation and turbidity, must be addressed first by management planners when designing a plan for orangespotted sunfish. Not much information has been collected on the changes of floodplain waters, and more is needed to fully understand the needs of the orangespotted sunfish before management can be implemented. One solution to decrease lake sedimentation is through a process of ‘lake drawdowns,’ which are installed by managers to compact sediments and controlled by pumps. The drawdowns mimic pre-dam conditions that would naturally harden and compact sediment. This process can be expensive, but it has already been implemented by the United States Army Corps of Engineers in Swan Lake, Illinois through their habitat rehabilitation and enhancement project (HREP). Seasonal drawdowns can increase river connectivity and has been seen to increase habitat for orangespotted sunfish populations. Water pollution by energy plants, such as the one monitored by TDEC, is a long-term problem that will have to be taken into account by managers for many years.Southworth, G.R., Peterson, M.J., Roy, W.K., Mathews, T.J. 2011. Monitoring fish contaminant responses to abatement actions: factors that affect recovery, Environmental Management, 47:1064-1076. More studies should be done in all documented locations of orangespotted sunfish to assess the current population assemblages, and to track any future changes that occur. Monitoring can be done through the use of nets or electrofishing to measure population densities. At present, no lands need to be protected for this non-endangered fish, but careful consideration should be taken if new dams are created that fragment the orangespotted sunfish's habitat.

It is an autonomous college affiliated to the University of Madras and is partly residential. The college, which is under the direction of the Society of the Franciscan Missionaries of Mary, is a minority institution. It has five hostels – Snehalaya, Our Lady's, Klemens, St. Josephs and Nava Nirmana. Introduction Beginning in a small one-storey building on 15 August 1947, with an enrollment of 32 students, the college has at present over 5,500 students housed in large buildings on the campus of \\"The Cloisters\\", Cathedral Road, Chennai. The college became autonomous in 1987 and has 19 undergraduate and 12 postgraduate programmes. Research programmes such as M.Phil, PhD, and postgraduate diploma courses are part of the academic curriculum. Exterior of St Francis Hall, Stella Maris History The college is under the management of the Institute of the Franciscan Missionaries of Mary. It was founded on 15 August 1947 with an enrollment of 32 students in the intermediate class. Stella Maris was granted permanent recognition in 1951. The college has the unique credit of having initiated bachelor's degrees in Western Music and History of Fine Arts, as well as master's degrees in Social Work and Indian Music, at the University of Madras. Additionally, it was the first women's college in Madras to offer M.A. degree courses in English, economics, and fine arts. In 1960, the college moved from Santhome to a more spacious campus, \\"The Cloisters\\", Cathedral Road, Chennai. The following few decades saw tremendous growth and development in the college with several firsts and distinctions. The college was one of the few chosen to start the pilot project of the National Service Scheme in 1968. A spacious library was erected on the occasion of the Silver Jubilee of the college in 1972 and occupies a place of pride on the campus as well as in Chennai. From 1978 onwards there was a shift in the admission policy, keeping in mind the thrust of the college towards social justice. Conscious of the growing need for academic freedom, the college launched into autonomy in 1987; the 1990s saw the college offering several new job-oriented courses as well as additional sections for the departments of B.Com. and mathematics. On the occasion of the Golden Jubilee, the St. Clare's Centre- a four-story building that houses the administrative offices, an audio-visual room, computer laboratories, and several classrooms- was erected. With ten years of experiential learning processes behind it, the college restructured its system of education by introducing a credit-based system in 1997, offering many new academic programmes that encourage interdisciplinary associations. Coaching for the civil services exams was launched in November 2009. The college also conducts coaching classes for both faculty and students who are preparing to appear for the NET and SLET exams.

Despite only living to age 33, he played a major role in the founding of Latin jazz. He co-wrote some of Dizzy Gillespie's Latin-flavored compositions, such as \\"Manteca\\" and \\"Tin Tin Deo\\", and was the first Latin percussionist in Gillespie's band. Early life Luciano \\"Chano\\" Pozo González was born in Havana to Cecelio González and Carnación Pozo. Chano grew up with three sisters and a brother, as well as his older half brother, Félix Chappottín, who would later become one of the great Cuban soneros. The family struggled with poverty throughout his youth. His mother died when Chano was eleven, and Cecelio took his family to live with his long-time mistress, Natalia, who was Felix's mother. Chano showed an early interest in playing drums, and performed ably in Afro-Cuban religious ceremonies in which drumming was a key element. The family lived for many years at El África Solar (Africa neighborhood), a former slave quarters, by all accounts a foul and dangerous place, where it was said even the police were afraid to venture. In this environment criminal activities flourished, and Chano learned the ways of the street as means of survival. He dropped out of school after the third grade and earned a solid reputation as a rowdy tough guy, big for his age and exceptionally fit. He spent his days playing drums, fighting, drinking, and engaging in petty criminal activities, the latter of which landed him a stint in a youth reformatory. No official records document the crime he was sentenced for, though at least one account has him causing the accidental death of a foreign tourist, adding to a record of thievery, assault, and truancy. At the age of 13, Chano was sent to the reformatory in Guanajay, where he learned reading and writing, auto body repair, and honed his already exceptional skills playing a variety of drums. =Santería= During this time he became a devotee of Santería. Also known as \\"La Regla de Ocha\\", this is an Afro-Caribbean religion derived from traditional beliefs of the Yoruba people of Nigeria. Developed among Afro-Cuban slaves, the religion began as a blending of these West African spiritual beliefs and Catholic doctrine. Yoruba deities were identified with Catholic saints to fool the slave owners, as the Spanish colonialists had forbidden the practice of African religions. Chano pledged allegiance to the Catholic Saint Barbara, identified widely with Shango, the Yoruba god of fire and thunder, and took him as his personal protector. Both Shango and St. Barbara had associations with the color red, and for the rest of his life Chano would often carry a red scarf signifying his allegiance. Upon his release from Guanajay, Chano returned to his father's house in Havana. Cecelio persuaded his son to practice his trade of bootblack, but Chano's temperament was not suited for this occupation and he quit after less than a year. In 1929 he took a job selling newspapers for El País, Havana's most influential publication, hawking papers on a number of street corners. His forceful nature and success in selling brought him to the attention of newspaper owner and influential businessman Alfredo Suárez, who hired Chano as his personal driver and bodyguard. He was rumored to have performed duties as debt collector or \\"leg breaker\\" for Suarez. Chano spent his free time dancing, singing, fighting, chasing women and playing his drums. He also began to compose music. Carnival Chano's reputation grew among the people each year, not only because of his physical prowess as a dancer, drummer, and success with women, but for the compositions he wrote for Carnival, during the nightly celebrations of which neighborhoods formed highly competitive comparsas, or street troupes. They consisted of singers, dancers, musicians, and the ever- present rumberos. Mostly young, street-toughened drummers, rumberos were integral to each comparsa (something like a 'jam club'), since rumberos provided throbbing, sensuous rhythms regarded as the base for all Afro-Cuban music. In a few years Pozo was the most well-known and sought after rumbero in Cuba, with the most talented comparsas (local groups) vying for his services, and was regularly winning top cash prizes for his compositions. Chano elevated the status and reputation of rumbero to near mythic proportions with his swaggering attitude as he led his own comparsa through the streets and with increasing successes became a hero to Havana's poor people. Pozo and some of his fellow musicians wrote a conga music composition that earned them first prize in the city of Santiago de Cuba's carnival of 1940: \\"La Comparsa de los Dandys,\\" a composition that some consider an unofficial theme song of Santiago de Cuba, and a familiar standard at many Latin American carnivals. Career in Cuba Cuba was by this time a popular tourist destination, with the biggest hotels, The Sevilla Biltmore, the Nacional, and El Presidente catering to rich Americans and Europeans, and Chano was determined to break the color barrier that restricted the employment of dark skinned people. He began to court musicians and others who might help him by auditioning in unusual places—such as in front of the Cuban-owned radio station Azul, which broadcast popular recordings as well as live Cuban folk music. Chano befriended many musicians who worked there, playing his drum on the street to catch their attention as they arrived for work. Though admired for his prodigious talent, dark skinned blacks were prohibited from working most venues outside of the slums, and Chano searched for opportunities. He found that opportunity with Armando Trinidad, owner of the radio station. Armando persuaded Chano to work for him as the bouncer for Azul, where his imposing size and reputation kept rowdy crowds in check. To survive racial marginalization in Cuba, he worked cleaning shoes and selling newspapers. He first performed as a dancer in a Havana troupe known as The Dandy. His brother was the Cuban trumpeter Felix Chapotín. He later worked at the radio station Cadena Azul. Once Pozo became famous, he also became renowned for his sense of fashion, including sometimes wearing an all-white top hat and tuxedo. New York In 1947 he immigrated to the U.S. in search of a better life. He was encouraged to do so by Mario Bauza and his childhood friend Miguelito Valdes. It was Mario Bauza who introduced Chano to Dizzy Gillespie who was looking to include a conga player into his musical group. Chano Pozo is one of a handful of Cuban percussionists who came to the United States in the 1940s and '50s. Other notable congueros who came to the U.S. during that time include Mongo Santamaría, Armando Peraza, Francisco Aguabella, Julito Collazo, Carlos Vidal Bolado, Desi Arnaz and Modesto Durán. Pozo moved to New York City in early 1947 with the encouragement of Miguelito Valdés, and participated in a recording session with Valdés, the legendary band leader Arsenio Rodríguez, Carlos Vidal Bolado and José Mangual. In September 1947, after Mario Bauzá introduced the two, he featured in Dizzy Gillespie's Big Band at Carnegie Hall and subsequently on a European tour. Their notable material includes \\"Cubana Be, Cubana Bop\\" (written by George Russell), and \\"Tin Tin Deo\\" and \\"Manteca\\", both co-written by Pozo. Death Chano Pozo was shot and killed on December 2, 1948 in the El Rio Bar at 111th St and Lenox Avenue in Harlem. The Rio Bar no longer exists—even the small triangular block where it was located has been removed. Pozo's killer was a local bookie named Eusebio \\"Cabito\\" Munoz. Pozo had accused Cabito of selling him poor quality marijuana and Cabito retaliated. Pozo is buried in the Colón Cemetery, Havana. His grandson Joaquín Pozo, who was living in Cuba as of 2006, is also a famous conguero.Birth of the Cool: Beat, Bebop, and the American Avant Garde By Lewis MacAdams Discography * Chris Connor, A Jazz Date with Chris Connor (Atlantic, 1958) * Dizzy Gillespie, The Complete RCA Victor Recordings (Bluebird, 1995) * Illinois Jacquet & Ben Webster, The Kid and the Brute (Clef, 1955) * Peggy Lee, Basin Street East Proudly Presents Miss Peggy Lee Recorded at the Fabulous New York Club (Capitol, 1961) * Machito, Ritmo Caliente (Proper, 2002) * Charlie Parker & Dizzy Gillespie, Diz 'n' Bird at Carnegie Hall (Roost, 1997) * Clark Terry & Chico O'Farrill, Spanish Rice (Impulse!, 1966) In popular culture *Cuban drummer Chino Pozo claimed to be related to Chano Pozo. *Pozo is featured (in animated form) in the fictional animated film Chico and Rita (2010), where the circumstances surrounding his death are included as part of the plot line. *Pozo is mentioned in a monologue by character Roland Turner, played by John Goodman, in the film Inside Llewyn Davis.

(2014). The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism, Princeton University Press, p. 46 which teach that the Buddha is eternal, that the non-Self and emptiness teachings only apply to the worldly sphere and not to Nirvāṇa, and that the Tathāgatagarbha is real and immanent within all beings and all phenomena. The sutra consists mostly of stanzas in verse.http://www.sutrasmantras.info/sutra54a.html The Mahāyāna Aṅgulimālīya Sūtra should not be confused with the Pāli Canon's Angulimala Sutta, which is a completely different work included in the Majjhima Nikaya.  Origins and history  According to Stephen Hodge, internal textual evidence in the Aṅgulimālīya Sūtra, Mahābherihāraka Parivarta Sūtra, and the Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra, indicates that these texts were first circulated in southern India, and they then gradually propagated up to the northwest, with Kashmir being the other major center. The Aṅgulimālīya Sūtra gives a more detailed account by mentioning the points of distribution as including southern India, the Vindhya Range, Bharukaccha, and Kashmir. Hodge summarizes his findings as follows: In the 6th century CE, Paramārtha wrote that the Mahāsāṃghikas revere the sūtras which teach the Tathāgatagarbha.  Central teachings  The Aṅgulimālīya Sūtra consists largely of teachings by Aṅgulimālīya on the correct understanding of Buddhist doctrine. According to Michael Radich, The sutra is most insistent that the Tathāgatagarbha and the self (Ātman) are real and that to deny their existence is to lapse into a state of dangerous spiritual imbalance. Thus, to seek out the Tathāgatagarbha — which is equated with the true Self — is deemed of great value. The Buddha teaches the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī that practicing the spiritual life is meaningful only because there is a 'self principle' (the Tathāgatagarbha or 'atma-dhatu' - 'essence of Self') with which the quest can be rewarded. He states: The sutra is remarkable for the vigor and passion with which Aṅgulimālīya teaches the Dharma and for its doctrine that at the heart of all beings is one unified principle: the buddha-dhatu (Buddha-nature) or Tathāgatagarbha. The doctrines of this sutra are also strikingly congruent with those of the much longer Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra.

He has also written music for films such as Extremes (1971) and After Midnight (1990), and the Broadway play Serious Money (1987). Early band work Mick Gallagher started his musical career in Newcastle with The Unknowns in the early 1960s. He played with the Animals during 1965, replacing their founding member Alan Price. He moved on to form The Chosen Few, where he played alongside Alan Hull, who later formed Lindisfarne. Other associations include Skip Bifferty, Peter Frampton's Camel and Cochise. In 1977 Gallagher was playing in a band called Loving Awareness, including John Turnbull, Charley Charles and Norman Watt-Roy. Charles and Watt-Roy worked as sessions musicians with Ian Dury, and when the group went on tour, Gallagher and Turnbull were invited along. This band became the Blockheads. Ian Dury and the Blockheads Under the management of Andrew King and Peter Jenner, the original managers of Pink Floyd, Ian Dury and the Blockheads quickly gained a reputation as one of the top live acts of new wave music. The Blockheads' sound drew from its members' diverse musical influences, which included jazz, rock and roll, funk, reggae and Dury's love of music hall. Gallagher's Hammond sound was a major contribution to the band. The single \\"Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll\\", released 26 August 1977, marked Blockheads' Stiff debut. Although it was banned by the BBC, it was named Single of the Week by NME on its release. The single issue was soon followed at the end of September by the album New Boots and Panties!!, which, although it did not include the single, achieved platinum status. In October 1977 Gallagher and the band started performing as Ian Dury & the Blockheads, when the band signed on for the Stiff \\"Live Stiffs Tour\\" alongside Elvis Costello & the Attractions, Nick Lowe, Wreckless Eric and Larry Wallis. The tour was a success, and Stiff launched a concerted Ian Dury marketing campaign, resulting in the Top Ten hit \\"What a Waste\\", and the hit single \\"Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick\\", which reached No. 1 in the UK at the beginning of 1979, selling just short of a million copies. Again, \\"Hit Me\\" was not included on the original release of the subsequent album Do It Yourself. Both the single and its accompanying music video featured Davey Payne playing two saxophones simultaneously during his solo, in evident homage to jazz saxophonist Rahsaan Roland Kirk, whose \\"trademark\\" technique this was. With their hit singles, the band built up a dedicated following in the UK and other countries, and their next single \\"Reasons to be Cheerful, Part 3\\" made number three in the UK. The band's second album, Do It Yourself, was released in June 1979 in a Barney Bubbles-designed sleeve of which there were over a dozen variations, all based on samples from the Crown wallpaper catalogue. Bubbles also designed the Blockhead logo. Jankel left the band temporarily and relocated to the U.S. after the release of \\"What a Waste\\" (his organ part on that single was overdubbed later) but he subsequently returned to the UK and began touring sporadically with the Blockheads, eventually returning to the group full-time for the recording of \\"Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick\\"; according to Gallagher, the band recorded 28 takes of the song, but eventually settled on the second take for the single release. Partly due to personality clashes with Dury, Jankel left the group again in 1980 after the recording of the Do It Yourself LP, and he returned to the US to concentrate on his solo career. The group worked solidly over the eighteen months between the release of \\"Rhythm Stick\\" and their next single, \\"Reasons to Be Cheerful\\", which returned them to the charts, making the UK Top 10. Jankel was replaced by former Dr. Feelgood guitarist Wilko Johnson, who also contributed to the next album Laughter (1980) and its two hit singles, although Gallagher recalls that the recording of the Laughter album was difficult and that Dury was drinking heavily in this period. The Blockheads briefly reformed in June 1987 to play a short tour of Japan, and then disbanded again. In September 1990, following the death from cancer of drummer Charley Charles, they reunited for two benefit concerts in aid of Charles' family, held at The Forum, Camden Town, with Steven Monti on drums. In December 1990, augmented by Merlin Rhys-Jones on guitar and Will Parnell on percussion, they recorded the live album Warts & Audience at the Brixton Academy. The Blockheads (minus Jankel, who returned to California) toured Spain in January 1991, then disbanded again until August 1994 when, following Jankel's return to England, they were invited to reform for the Madstock! Festival in Finsbury Park; this was followed by sporadic gigs in Europe, Ireland, the UK and Japan through late 1994 and 1995. In March 1996 Dury was diagnosed with cancer and, after recovering from an operation, he set about writing another album. In early 1998 he reunited with the Blockheads to record the album Mr Love-Pants. In May, Ian Dury & the Blockheads hit the road again, with Dylan Howe replacing Steven Monti on drums. Davey Payne left the group permanently in August and was replaced by Gilad Atzmon; this line-up gigged throughout 1999, culminating in their last performance with Dury on 6 February 2000 at the London Palladium. Dury died six weeks later on 27 March 2000. Gallagher continued with the Blockheads after Dury's death, contributing to the tribute album Brand New Boots And Panties, then Where's The Party. The Blockheads still tour, and in 2009 released Staring Down the Barrel. They currently comprise Watt-Roy, Jankel, Gallagher, Turnbull, John Roberts on drums, Gilad Atzmon and Dave Lewis on saxes. Derek \\"The Draw\\" Hussey (who was Dury's friend and minder) is now writing songs with Jankel as well as singing. They are aided and abetted by Lee Harris, who is their \\"aide de camp\\". Other work Gallagher played on two of the most influential Clash albums, London Calling (1979) and Sandinista! (1980), and made live appearances with the band, also playing on their last album Cut the Crap (1985), for which he never received a credit. Gallagher worked with the Clash's drummer Topper Headon again in a short-lived band called Samurai, and again when they recorded Headon's Waking Up (1986), appearing with Bobby Tench and Jimmy Helms. Samurai guitarist Henry Padovani briefly described Gallagher in his memoir: \\"He had a family, was the serious one of the group, never snorted any coke and managed to somehow control Topper [Headon] a little. Playing with this talented musician was a pleasure.\\" Gallagher has also performed and recorded with Paul McCartney, Roger Daltrey, Robbie Williams, Dave Stewart and Annie Lennox. More recently he returned to perform with The Blockheads and John Steel's The Animals and Friends. Gallagher has also written music for films such as Extremes (1971) and After Midnight (1990), and the Broadway play Serious Money (1987). Personal life Gallagher has three children, Luke, Ben and Maria. In 1980, the three children sang on The Clash's fourth studio album, Sandinista!. Luke and Ben sang on \\"Career Opportunities\\" while Maria sang on \\"The Guns of Brixton\\" which was featured at the end of the song \\"Broadway\\" References External links Musicians from Newcastle upon Tyne English rock keyboardists English session musicians The Animals members 1945 births Living people The Blockheads members ","title":"Mick Gallagher"},{"id":"5022197","text":"Birdman Seat.

Early life Born in Paris, Édouard de Rothschild was the only son of Baron Alphonse James de Rothschild (1827–1905). His mother was Leonora de Rothschild (1837–1911), the daughter of Lionel de Rothschild of the English branch of the family. He was raised in a Paris mansion at 2 rue Saint-Florentin that is now home to the United States Embassy as well as at Château de Ferrières in the country. Career Only a few months after Édouard's marriage, his father died and he formally took over the running of de Rothschild Frères bank. His grandfather and the French bank founder, James Mayer de Rothschild, had stipulated \\"that the three branches of the family descended from him always be represented.\\" As such, Édouard would be joined by the sons of two different uncles: cousin Robert Philippe de Rothschild (1880–1946) and cousin Maurice de Rothschild (1881–1957). Édouard was cautious by nature and often old-fashioned in his ideas, an attitude which extended to his personal dress and office décor. Like his father, Édouard too was appointed a director of the Banque de France. In 1911, he negotiated a deal with Henri Deterding for his Royal Dutch Shell company to purchase the Rothschilds' Azerbaijan oil fields. In 1937, the government of France nationalized the country's railways including a major Rothschild railway asset owned in partnership with the English branch of the family. They had owned the Chemin de Fer du Nord rail transport company for almost 100 years and had an interest in the Chemins de fer de Paris à Lyon et à la Méditerranée railway which Robert represented for the family on its board of directors. Because of cousin Maurice's perceived flamboyant playboy image and his conduct in political and business activities, Édouard considered him to be something of a black sheep. They tolerated each other for the sake of the business but by the middle of the 1930s their differences reached a point where Édouard and cousin Robert decided to force Maurice out of de Rothschild Frères bank. After extensive and bitter negotiations, a buyout was reached through an arbitrator. Édouard de Rothschild inherited a share of the Château Lafite Rothschild vineyard in Bordeaux plus he also came into a valuable art collection from his father which he expanded through a number of important purchases. His large collection included pieces by prominent sculptors such as Jean-Louis Lemoyne and paintings from Vigée-Lebrun, Rembrandt and The Astronomer by Vermeer, amongst others. Thoroughbred horse racing/Polo Like his father, Édouard de Rothschild invested in thoroughbred horse racing. A horse enthusiast who also liked to ride, he was a good polo player and a member of a team that competed in Polo at the 1900 Summer Olympics. He inherited Haras de Meautry, a thoroughbred horse breeding farm in Touques, Calvados about 130 miles north of Paris. His sister Béatrice married Maurice Ephrussi whose family owned an estate at the village of Reux about eight miles away. In 1868, Édouard acquired the property and the Château de Reux remains in family hands to this day. Édouard de Rothschild kept a stable of thoroughbreds at the Chantilly Racecourse in Chantilly, Oise and raced horses at racecourses throughout France with great success. Among the major races his horses won were: * Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe - (2) - Brantôme (1934), Eclair au Chocolat (1938) * Critérium de Saint-Cloud - (3) - Rocking Chair (1921), Tonnelle (1936) Tricaméron (1938) * Critérium International - (4) - Flamant (1926), Godiche (1929), Brantôme (1933) Téléférique (1936) * Grand Prix de Paris - (2) - Sans Souci II (1907) Crudité (1935) * Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud - (4) - Prédicateur (1913), Cadum (1925), Bubbles (1929) Genièvre (1939) * Poule d'Essai des Poulains - (2) Mont Blanc (1922) Brantôme (1934) * Poule d'Essai des Pouliches - (4) - Flowershop (1920), Nephthys (1921), La Dame de Trèfle (1925) Ligne de Fond(1932) * Prix de Diane - (5) - Quenouille (1919), Flowershop (1920), Perruche Bleue (1932), Vendange (1933) Péniche (1935) * Prix du Cadran - (5) - Prédicateur (1913), Cadum (1925), Cacao (1929), Brantôme (1935) Chaudière (1936) * Prix Jacques le Marois - (3) - Ivain (1924), Vitamine (1927) Aromate (1935) * Prix Morny - (2) - Justitia (1898) Brantôme (1933) * Prix Lupin - (7) - Sans Souci (1907), Floraison (1912), Le Farina (1914), Bubbles (1928), Brantome (1934), Aromate (1935), Bacchus (1939) * Prix Royal-Oak - (5) - Stéarine (1919), Cacao (1928), Brantôme (1934), Bokbul (1935) Eclair au Chocolat (1938) * Prix Vermeille - (2) - Stearine (1919) Tonnelle (1937) During the German occupation of France in World War II, the Nazis seized some of the best racehorses in the country, shipping more than six hundred of them to Germany for racing and/or breeding. Among the horses stolen was Édouard de Rothschild's champion Brantôme who was sent to the German National Stud. The horse was repatriated at the end of the war in 1945 and became a leading sire. Effects of the German occupation, 1940–44 The rise to power of Adolf Hitler's National Socialist party in Germany and the subsequent Anschluss of Austria to Germany saw a wave of Jews, and others the Nazis labeled as \\"undesirables,\\" seek refuge in France. Most of these people escaped with little more than a suitcase of clothes. In March 1939, Édouard's wife Germaine converted an old house near the Château de Ferrières into a hostel for some 150 of these displaced persons. However, with the onset of World War II and the subsequent German occupation of France in 1940, Édouard de Rothschild and his family themselves chose to flee the country. In 1939, Édouard's son Guy joined the French Army and his daughter Jacqueline escaped with her husband Gregor Piatigorsky to the United States. Before leaving, Édouard de Rothschild tried to hide as much of his valuable art collection as possible, on the grounds of the Haras de Meautry farm and at his Château de Reux. The Nazis confiscated his collection. With his wife and second daughter Bethsabée, he safely left France and they made their way to Lisbon, Portugal from where they were able to go by plane to New York City. With the Allied liberation of France in 1944, Édouard de Rothschild and his wife returned home, where he died in Paris in 1949 at the age of eighty-one. His son Guy took over as head of the family bank. Personal life On 1 March 1905, Edouard de Rothschild married Germaine Alice Halphen (1884–1975). They had four children, but according to his daughter Jacqueline, neither parent paid much attention to them. Their children were: *Édouard Alphonse Émile Lionel de Rothschild (1906–1911) *Guy Édouard Alphonse Paul de Rothschild (1909–2007), who from 1937–1956 was married to Baroness Alix Hermine Jeanette Schey de Koromla (1911–1982), and who later married Baroness Marie-Hélène van Zuylen van Nyevelt (1927–1996) in 1957The Whims of Fortune: The Memoirs of Guy de Rothschild by Guy de Rothschild.

It differs from accretion, which describes a gradual addition to land resulting from the action of water. Avulsion and riparian owners The distinction between avulsion and accretion becomes important where a river forms the boundary between two riparian owners. In many jurisdictions, if the river changes channels by avulsion, the boundary does not change but remains in the middle of the old channel. For example, the Mississippi River forms the boundary between several U.S. states, the principle being the reason that states on the lower Mississippi have occasional pieces of land on the opposite side from the rest of the state.

Jimma is named for the former Kingdom of Jimma, which was absorbed into the former province of Kaffa in 1932. Jimma is bordered on the south by the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region, the northwest by Illubabor, on the north by Misraq Welega, and on the northeast by Mirab Shewa; part of the boundary with Misraq Shewa is defined by the Gibe River. The highest point in this zone is Mount Maigudo (2,386 m). Towns and cities in Jimma include Agaro, Genet and Saqqa. The town of Jimma was separated from Jimma Zone and is a special zone now. The Central Statistical Agency (CSA) reported that 26,743 tons of coffee were produced in this zone in the year ending in 2005, based on inspection records from the Ethiopian Coffee and Tea authority. This represents 23.2% of the Region's output and 11.8% of Ethiopia's total output, and makes Jimma one of the three top producers of these goods, along with the Sidama and Gedeo Zones.CSA 2005 National Statistics , Table D.2 Historically, Jimma has been considered one of the food-exporting areas of Ethiopia, but beginning in 1997 poor crops harvests and the appearance of crop diseases such as Grey leaf spot, caused by the fungus Cercospora zeaemaydis (not previously common in Ethiopia) led to a deterioration in conditions. By 1999, signs of the seriousness of the situation included empty household granaries, people begging and committing crimes in the hope they will be fed in jail, sending children to live with relatives or friends, and reduced student enrollment in schools.Dechassa Lemessa, \\"Prosperity Fades: Jimma and Illubabor Zones of Oromia Region\\", UN- OCHA report November 1999 (accessed 3 April 2009)  Demographics  Based on the 2007 Census conducted by the CSA, this Zone has a total population of 2,486,155, an increase of 26.76% over the 1994 census, of whom 1,250,527 are men and 1,235,628 women; with an area of 15,568.58 square kilometers, Jimma has a population density of 159.69.

She was a Casco-class, light-draft monitor intended for service in the shallow bays, rivers, and inlets of the Confederacy. These warships sacrificed armor plate for a shallow draft and were fitted with a ballast compartment designed to lower them in the water during battle. Design revisions Though the original designs for the Casco- class monitors were drawn by John Ericsson, the final revision was created by Chief Engineer Alban C. Stimers following Rear Admiral Samuel F. Du Pont's failed bombardment of Fort Sumter in 1863. By the time that the plans were put before the Monitor Board in New York City, Ericsson and Simers had a poor relationship, and Chief of the Bureau of Construction and Repair John Lenthall had little connection to the board. This resulted in the plans being approved and 20 vessels ordered without serious scrutiny of the new design. $14 million US was allocated for the construction of these vessels. It was discovered that Stimers had failed to compensate for the armor his revisions added to the original plan and this resulted in excessive stress on the wooden hull frames and a freeboard of only 3 inches. Stimers was removed from the control of the project and Ericsson was called in to undo the damage. He was forced to raise the hulls of the monitors under construction by 22 inches to make them seaworthy. Fate As a result, the Navy Department suspended completion of the ship 17 June 1865, and she was laid up at League Island Navy Yard, Philadelphia, without any active service. Renamed Argos 15 June 1869, she was again renamed Koka 10 August that same year.

The college was named for Geoffrey Kaye, its chief sponsor. In addition to improving the status of teachers in Israel, the college contributes to educational activities in the Southern region and conducts many projects in the Jewish and Bedouin sectors in conjunction with the Ministry of Education, Beersheva municipality, Ben-Gurion University, regional councils, JOINT and the \\"SAKTA-RASHI\\" Foundation.  History  Kaye Academic College of Education started off as a college for new immigrant teachers in two sheds in a neighborhood known as \\"Meshek Ezer\\" in Beersheva. It was founded in 1954 by Arie Simon, who was the school inspector for the Southern Region at the time. The aim was to provide a solution to the outrageous lack of teachers in the various types of settlements for new immigrants. The establishment of the college, in fact, laid the foundations of the education system in the Negev. In 1960, after moving from one temporary building to another, the first institute of education was permanently housed in the \\"Gimmel\\" neighborhood in Beer Sheva, and was named \\"the National College for Teachers and Kindergarten Teachers\\". The college expanded and developed rapidly, and from the beginning of the 70s, it began to train teachers – including new immigrant teachers and teachers in the Bedouin sector – for most teaching tracks. In 1982, the college moved to its present location, and its name was changed to Kaye Academic College of Education. At the same time, the National College for Sports Education, which had been founded in 1964 by the late Dr. Eli Freedman, was incorporated into Kaye College. In 1994, Kaye College was granted academic status, and was thereby entitled to confer a B.Ed. degree. In 2003, the Academic Council of the college, which had been approved by the Council for Higher Education, began to conduct its various activities. The Academic Council is currently preparing to offer M.Ed. training programs.  Academic tracks  300px At present, there are more than 2,000 Jewish and Bedouin students studying in various tracks: * Kindergarten teachers (for children ages 0–6) * Teaching of the first grades (kindergarten and the first and second grades) * Primary school (first to sixth grades) * The track for middle school teachers, which offers specializations in Bible, Hebrew grammar and literature, Arabic, English, Mathematics, Computers, Natural Sciences and Informal Education. * Special Education (for pupils ages 6–20) * Physical Education (first to twelfth grades) * Art (first to twelfth grades).

The Bârzava is part of the Black Sea drainage basin and flows into the river Timiș (or Tamiš). It is 166 km long and has a drainage area of 1,190 km². Name The Romanian forms Bârzava and Bêrzava (last form yet in 19th century newspapers) are of Dacian origin and means \\"birch river\\" (cf. Latvian river names Bērzupe and Bārzupe 'birch river', -ava is common ending for Baltic river names, cf. Daugava). The Serbian form Brzava is a derivation from Bêrzava and adopted to Serbian brz/брз 'quick', thus meaning \\"the quick river\\" in Slavic languages. Bârzava name had been also given to a commune in Arad, and a village in Harghita.  Romania  The Bârzava springs out in the Semenic Mountains part of the Carpathian Mountains, western Romania, east of the city of Reșița. The river runs to the northeast, close to the Piatra Goznei peak and through the village of Vâliug, reaching the northernmost part of the Semenic mountains, where it turns to the northwest. It runs through the cities of Reșița and Bocșa the largest settlements on its course, and continues next to the villages of Berzovia, and Șoșdea, where the Bârzava leaves the mountain region of Banat for the lower western plain. This is also where the river turns to the southwest, spills in several parallel streams and flows next to the villages of Sculia, Gătaia, Sângeorge, Rovinița Mare and Denta. From this point, until its confluence into the Tamiš, the Bârzava's river bed is channeled. After it flows next to the village of Partoș, it forms the Romanian-Serbian border for a few kilometers and after the course of 127 km through Romania, the Bârzava enters the Serbian province of Vojvodina near the hamlet of Markovićevo.  Serbia  The Brzava runs next to the villages of Konak and Banatska Dubica, where it becomes part of the largest canal system in Serbia, Canal Danube-Tisa-Danube. The only remaining settlement on the river is the village of Jarkovac, before it empties into the Tamiš, south of the village of Botoš. The river's complete 39 km course through Serbia is statistically classified as a Canal Brzava, but it is not navigable.

It is sailed in Australia and New Zealand. It is in length, hence the name, and is a two-man boat. Both the crew and the helm are able to use the trapeze at the same time. It has an asymmetrical spinnaker and a jib, in addition to the mainsail. History The origin of the 12 ft Skiff is dubious, but it is thought to have roots in the smaller skiffs sailed on Sydney Harbour in the late 1800s. The skiff became a class in its own right in 1926 when, at a meeting between Lane Cove 12ft Sailing Skiff Club, Greenwich 12 ft Flying Squadron, The Spit 12 ft Skiff Sailing Club and Vaucluse Amateur 12 ft Sailing Skiff Club, the 12 ft Sailing Skiff Council was formed. At this time the skiff was manned by a crew of five, but around the 1940s it changed to a three-man boat, and then became the two man boat that is used today. In 1947 the Council changed its name to the NSW 12 ft Sailing Skiff Association. After the 1940s the skiff went international.  Design  * Overall length 3.7 metres * Beam 1.8 metres * Crewed by two people, both on trapeze * Light weight 45 kilogram hull * Sail area and rig design are unlimited * Mast height is unlimited but can be up to 8.8 metres * Most boats have three complete rigs (small, medium, large) * Each skiff is individual, not an off the shelf product * Simple measurement rules allow design development * The asymmetrical spinnaker is set off a fixed bowsprit  Sailing and Racing  Today the 12 ft Skiff is primarily sailed in Australia and New Zealand. Campaigning a 12 requires a range of skills, including boat handling, tuning, boat maintenance, organisation and training. However, with recent equipment developments, and the introduction of carbon masts, 12 ft Skiffs are very manageable boats and any sailor with relative experience, such as Cherubs or Moths, would quite easily adapt. Performance The 12 ft Skiff is similar to the larger and better known 18ft Skiff. Of all skiffs the 12 footer is known for being the most difficult to sail, primarily due to its short and narrow hull relative to its large sail area. A 12 ft Skiff is capable of sailing at speeds of up to . The 12 ft Skiff generates considerable power by having two persons on the trapeze wire, suspended from the mast of the boat. This adds leverage to the crews' weight, allowing the larger areas of sail to be carried. The modern 12 ft Skiffs also have fixed bowsprits to from which they carry their spinnakers. This is a relatively recent innovation, with the older style of skiff having an 'end to end' spinnaker pole which would need to be positioned by the crew, and would be stored against the skiff's boom when it was not being used.

Origin  Mlava originates as the Tisnica, from the Kučaj mountains in eastern Serbia, under the Veliki Krš peak. It flows to the north and curves around the eastern slopes of the mountain Beljanica, through an almost uninhabited area. Reaching the Homolje region, the Tisnica receives from the right a very powerful outflow of the karst well of Žagubičko vrelo (Žagubica well), at an altitude of 320 meters, and from that point the river is known as the Mlava. Measured from the Žagubičko vrelo, the river is 118 km long.  Upper course (Homolje region)  Originally, the Mlava flows to the northwest, but soon turns to the north, which is the general direction it follows for the rest of its course. It flows next to the Žagubica, the main center of Homolje valley, and the villages of Izvarica (where it receives from the right the Jošanička reka), Ribare, Sige and Ladne Vode. In this section, the Mlava carved a long gorge, Gornjčako-ribarska klisura (Cyrillic: Горњачко- рибарска клисура; The gorge of Gornjak-Ribare), which begins at the Ribare, than it widens into the Krepoljin widening (where the large village of Krepoljin is located), and narrows again. Breaking through the ending part of the gorge at the village of Ždrelo, near the monastery of Gornjak, the Mlava leaves the Homolje for the Mlava region.  Middle course (Mlava region)  In this section, the Mlava valley widens, as the river flows next to the villages of Šetonje, Malo Laole, Veliko Laole, and reaches the town of Petrovac na Mlavi, the center of the whole Mlava region. It continues to the north, passes through the villages of Kamenovo, Trnovče and Rašanac and enters the hilly region of Stig.  Lower course (Stig region)  300px In the lower part of the Mlava is divided into many parallel flows and causes frequent floods, and although many settlements are located near the river, none is on its shore. The villages near the Mlava are: Veliko Selo, Toponica, Kalište, Malo Crniće, Veliko Crniće, Salakovac, Trnjane, Nabrde, Bubushinac and Bradarac. In this part, in Mlava, its two largest tributaries are on the left side of the Chokordin and Vitovnica on the right. One Mlava sleeve runs several kilometers from Pozarevac and the width of the trough is 35-60m in the depth of the trough is 2-3m, while the width of the second trough (Mogila is 10-20m and the depth is 1 to 1, 5м. The last two settlements on the Mlace are the village Drmno and the town Kostolac. In both places there are coal coal and are located in the center of Kostolac basin. Mlava does not affect the main drainage of Danube, but in Topla Mlava at a height of 65 meters, which is created by a brush from which the hot water from the lake (TE KOSTOLAC B canal) is released. In the rainy years, Wild Mlava spreads over 100 m while the normal width of that part of Mlava near Bradarac and Drmna is only 45–80 m, and the normal depth is about 3–4 m. Some geographers call this Wild Mlava system, while Warm Mlava is considered as the final part of the Mlava stream, until Mlava turns its old trough \\"Cold Mlava\\" (Donja Mogila), east of Kostolac.  Warm Mlava  File:Reka_Mlava.jpg10.jpg Mlava Brbor Warm Mlava (Topla Mlava) is a canal that connects Mlava (Wild Mlava) with the Danube east of the village of Selo Kostolac and west of the Kostolac B TPP. Its length is 4.3 km from the brush to the mouth, and from the yellow bridge (Viminacijum Bridge) to the intersection of 6.1 km. Its characteristics are warm water that comes out of the brush because of which there are plenty of fish and its biggest resident is pike. The width is about 3 to 7 normal Mlava basins (90–210 m) and the depth is up to 10 m.  Characteristics  The drainage area of the Mlava covers 2,810 km2 and belongs the Black Sea drainage area. Average annual discharge at the mouth is 34 m³/s.  References  * Jovan Đ.

The results of the survey help administrators and professors to assess their students' student engagement. The survey targets first-year and senior students on campuses. NSSE developed ten student Engagement Indicators (EIs) that are categorized in four general themes: academic challenge, learning with peers, experiences with faculty, and campus environment. Since 2000, there have been over 1,600 colleges and universities that have opted to participate in the survey. Additionally, approximately 5 million students within those institutions have completed the engagement survey. Overall, NSSE assesses effective teaching practices and student engagement in educationally purposeful activities. The survey is administered and assessed by Indiana University School of Education Center for Postsecondary Research.  History  The initial idea of the National Survey of Student Engagement centers on providing an alternative metric of evaluation for colleges and universities to measure \\"quality\\" on a national platform and it is designed specifically to gauge the extent of student engagement.Kuh, G. D. (2001). The National Survey of Student Engagement: Conceptual framework and overview of psychometric properties. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Center for Postsecondary Research, 1–26. The NSSE was birthed in 1998 and financially supported by a grant from the Pew Charitable Trusts. Much of the quality metrics according to the initial working group of higher education leaders that the Pew Charitable Trust organized concluded that there were few external incentives for institutions to partake in \\"meaningful quality improvement\\". The quality concept as it relates to colleges and universities has largely been impacted by accrediting agencies, government regulations (e.g. licensure standards), and third-party rankings (e.g. U.S. News and World Report) that focus on student selectivity and faculty credentials. Nevertheless, these types of quality metrics do not give insight regarding the resources institutions invest to facilitate significant academic experiences/activities or effective instructional practices that demonstrate high-level of engagement and success in college = Objectives = The National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE) contestably, serves as a tool for four-year institutions to gather data centered on institutional quality, ultimately to be used to improve undergraduate studies.National Survey of Student Engagement. (2014). Bringing the Institution into Focus—Annual Results 2014.Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Center for Postsecondary Research. This quality is measured by the energy that students spend engaging in meaningful educational experiences ( high-impact practices) during college that have significantly impacted desired learning outcomes and overall student experiences, regardless of institutional type and the individual.Pascarella, E. T., & Terenzini, P. T. (1991). How college affects students. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.Pace, C. R. (1980). Measuring the quality of student effort. Current Issues in Higher Education, 2(1), 10–16. Purposeful institutional priorities and practices lead to student engagement and student success in college. Institutions that align their resources to foster engagement potentially experience higher levels of quality– the marriage of purposeful engagement and institutional quality.Kuh, G.D. (2001). Assessing what really matters to student learning: Inside the National Survey of Student Engagement. Change, 33(3), 10–17, 66. There are several identifiers that researchers have studied that draw parallels to student success among institutions; the survey provides colleges and universities with the student engagement data that show strengths and opportunities for growth.Kuh, George D. (2008). \\"High-impact educational practices: What they are, who has access to them, and why they matter.\\" AAC&U;, Washington, D.C.  Student engagement defined  Students' responses in the survey have been categorized into ten Engagement Indicators (EIs) and narrowly concentrated among four general themes: academic challenge, learning with peers, experiences with faculty, and campus environment. NSSEs ten Engagement Indicators include:higher-order learning, reflective and integrative learning, learning strategies, quantitative reasoning, learning with peers, discussions with diverse others, experiences with faculty, effective teaching practices, quality of interactions, and supportive environments. Moreover, NSSE provides results on six High-Impact practices (HIPs) that are duly noted for their positive outcomes on student learning and retention.National Survey of Student Engagement. (2015). Engagement Indicators. Retrieved from National Survey of Student Engagement : http://nsse.indiana.edu/html/engagement_indicators.cfm These HIPs are known by researchers as educational experiences that shift one's trajectory of success in college. The HIPs refer to: learning community, service-learning, research with faculty (effective for first-year student and seniors), internship or field experience, study abroad, and culminating senior experience that seniors should engage in (e.g. capstone project). In 2008, George Kuh suggested that all students should experience at least one HIP during their first-year and one during senior year. These teaching and learning practices have been proven to be beneficial to college students from various backgrounds.  NSSE survey – outcomes  The survey offers an unconventional assessment for evaluating collegiate quality by collecting data that is used to depict institutional experiences and instructional practices that affects learning and college student success. There are three envisioning principles for data collected by NSSE. The first is to allow a vehicle for institutions to improve upon its undergraduate studies program (e.g. how the institution aligns with its strategic foci). Secondly, external agencies such as accrediting bodies and state agencies of higher education could use the information to gauge institutional effectiveness. Lastly, the publication of results could be of interest to media outlets as a means of incorporating into college ranking metrics. = Selected results = * While aggregate results generally reveal that underrepresented and underprepared students rate the quality of their interactions with others on campus lower relative to their peers, these groups evidenced no relative disadvantage at an appreciable subset of institutions. * Average levels of students' experiences with faculty—effective teaching practices and student-faculty interaction—varied notably from one institution to the next, even when examined within selectivity strata. * One in three first-year students rarely met with an advisor.

Early life Born in New Court, St Swithin's Lane, in the City of London, Anthony de Rothschild was the third child and second son of Nathan Mayer Rothschild and Hanna Barent Cohen. Multilingual, he studied at the University of Göttingen in Germany and the University of Strasbourg in France. He then went to work for N M Rothschild & Sons in London and was sent to train at de Rothschild Frères in Paris and M A Rothschild & Söhne in Frankfurt. In 1840 Anthony Nathan de Rothschild married Louise Montefiore (1821–1910). She was a cousin, the daughter of Henriette Rothschild (1791–1866) and Abraham Montefiore. They had two daughters: # Constance (1843–1931), married Cyril Flower, 1st Baron Battersea (1843–1907) # Annie Henrietta (1844–1926), married the Hon. Elliot Constantine Yorke, (1843–1878) son of the 4th Earl of Hardwicke. Banking career On his father's death in 1836, Anthony became a partner in the bank. Anthony's eldest brother Lionel de Rothschild worked at the bank but in time became more and more involved in politics. With younger brother Nathaniel settling permanently in Paris and acquiring the Château Brane Mouton vineyard, and youngest brother Mayer Amschel showing little interest in banking, a good portion of the responsibility for running the family's investment house fell on Anthony's shoulders. Working with brother Lionel and his cousin James in Paris, Anthony was a key figure in the 1845 creation and management of the Chemin de Fer du Nord, the family's rail transport business in France. Anthony Rothschild's involvement with the financing of European railways was extensive and included the Chemins de fer de Paris à Lyon et à la Méditerranée, the Imperial Lombardo Venetian and Central Italian Railway Company of which brother Lionel was a director as well as funding railroad construction in Brazil. In the 1840s he was involved with their investment in an ironworks in Mexico that supplied product for the building of that country's railway system. In addition, he was part of the 1852 negotiations for the lease whereby the Rothschilds took over the running of the Royal Mint Refinery in London and took charge of overseeing the operation. Private life Like other members of the Rothschild family, Anthony was a dedicated collector of art and antiquities, making purchases from dealers across Europe. He acquired several pieces of exceedingly rare faience from France. He owned paintings such as \\"Portrait of a Man as the God Mars\\" by Peter Paul Rubens and \\"The Dispatch of the Messenger\\" by François Boucher. In the early 1850s, Anthony de Rothschild acquired Aston Clinton House, an estate in Aston Clinton near Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire. He had been raised in London and although he maintained an opulent home at Grosvenor Place, he preferred country living where he liked to ride horses and participate in the hunt. At his stables he raised Thoroughbred racehorses, producing a number of successful winners on the track. A philanthropist, his support for various causes included an endowment of an infants school at Aston Clinton. He was also active in the London Jewish community, supporting the Jews' Free School and was the first president of the United Synagogue upon its formation in 1870. Honours He was appointed High Sheriff of Buckinghamshire in 1861. A hereditary baron of the Austrian Empire, in 1847 Queen Victoria created Anthony de Rothschild the 1st Baronet de Rothschild, of Tring Park. Since he had no male heirs, the title went on his death to his nephew Nathan Mayer Rothschild, who was subsequently created Baron Rothschild in 1885, with which title the baronetcy remains merged. Later life Anthony Nathan de Rothschild died in 1876 at Woolston, Hampshire and was interred in the Willesden Jewish Cemetery. In his memory, his wife gifted Anthony Hall to the village of Aston Clinton, which is now a listed building. References *See list of references at: Rothschild banking family of England.

It is jointly administered by Shasta-Trinity, Klamath, and Six Rivers National Forests. About are administered by the Bureau of Land Management.Wilderness by agency Wilderness.net The wilderness is located in the Salmon and Scott Mountains, subranges of the Klamath Mountains region. The high, granitic and ultramafic peaks of the eastern half of the wilderness area are known as the Trinity Alps. Granite peaks at the core of the area are known as the White Trinities, reddish ultramafic peaks in the southeast are known as the Red Trinities, and the forested mountains in the western half of the wilderness are known as the Green Trinities. Flora and fauna The botanical diversity of the Trinity Alps is quite unique. The region has intrigued botanists for many years because of the predominance of the Sierran flora only from the Pacific Ocean. Conifers common in the Sierra Nevada such as foxtail pines, lodgepole pines, western white pines, whitebark pines, ponderosa pines, red firs, and white firs are also common in the Alps alongside the endemic Brewer spruce. Large wildfires swept through the western forests in recent years. Wildlife species include American black bears, black-tailed deer, North American cougars, California valley coyotes, and banded bobcats. Bears are common in the wilderness, so use a bear bag or bear canister. Geology Glacial cirques dominate the high country. The highest point is Thompson Peak at 9,001 ft (2,744 m). Recreation The wilderness contains approximately of hiking trails, including of the Pacific Crest Trail and of the Bigfoot Trail. The most popular entry points into the wilderness are from the Weaverville area around Trinity Lake or from Junction City. Additional routes are seasonally accessible by car from the north and west. The paved road north from Junction City leads to the Canyon Creek trail, the most popular trail in the wilderness. The longest trails take several days to complete. The Pacific Crest Trail traverses the Scott Mountains in the northeast portion of the wilderness. Glacial cirques hold many small lakes stocked with trout and ponds frequented by newts. Streams offer trout fishing, and tributaries to the lower Trinity River hold migratory steelhead and chinook salmon. Hunting occurs in late summer and fall for deer, bear, and bandtailed pigeon. Although some of the high lakes are popular in summer, most of the land is infrequently visited. Many of the trails are in poor condition and hard to follow, so skills with map and compass are essential. Rock climbing opportunities are excellent on vast granite slabs and peaks. Historic gold mining structures and relics add interest for visitors in various parts of the wilderness. Gold panning continues to be good for the experienced amateur. Granite Peak is a good destination for views as well as Silligo peak, on the four lake loop. Trinity Lake is visible to the South, and the much of the rest of the area is visible as well. Remnants of the old lookout station remain. Private land Until recently, about of private land (inholdings) remained within the Trinity Alps Wilderness.

Its routes served Manvers Main Colliery, Wath upon Dearne and the towns of Rotherham, Rawmarsh, Swinton and Mexborough. Early history The Mexborough & Swinton tramway network in 1920. Although plans were originally put forward in 1876 and again in 1881 it was not until August 1905 that construction of a standard gauge tramway finally commenced. The system commenced with a connection to that operated by Rotherham Corporation at the borough boundary, the point where the road crossed a small bridge on Earl Fitzwilliam’s Greasbrough Canal close by Rotherham Road railway station. The line ran through Parkgate, Rawmarsh, Swinton and Mexborough before terminating at the Old Toll Bar at the east end of Mexborough, a point just prior to the crossing of the South Yorkshire Navigation. The system was built by the National Electric Construction Company (NEC), which owned other systems in England, using the Dolter system of stud contact power supply (the reason given for this being the unsightliness of conventional overhead wiring) and public services began on Wednesday 6 February 1907 with a route linking College Square, Rotherham and Parkgate, this being extended to the company’s Dale Road depot in Rawmarsh three days later. The remainder of the line opened on 3 August. In the Dolter system the current was supplied from metal studs placed between the rails that became live and rose from the road to energize the motors of the tram passing over, being then supposed to become dead. This proved unsatisfactory since on occasions the studs remained upright and live so that horses following the tram hauling drays could receive an electric shock. In August 1908, following instructions from the Board of Trade, the company converted their system to overhead pick-up. The network The original Tramways Act also provided for a branch to serve Manvers Main colliery; this was never built. In 1915 the company opened two trolleybus routes: the first ran from Mexborough town centre to Manvers although failing to reach the main gates of the colliery due to a low bridge below the Midland Railway line; the second ran from the Old Toll Bar to Conisbrough, the terminus being two miles away from that of Doncaster Corporation's tramways. Manvers is the only locality in England to have had a trolleybus before a tramway. Mexborough & Swinton's lines were in contact with other tramway companies' line in two localities. It met the Dearne District Light Railways at Woodman Inn, Swinton, and the Rotherham Tramway at the borough boundary. Rolling stock The tramway passed beneath two low bridges at Parkgate and Swinton. Because of this, the sixteen Mexborough trams and the Rotherham trams used for through joint service to and from the town were fitted with low-height top covers. Conversion The tramways were closed and the routes became operated by twenty single-deck trolleybuses in 1928 and 1929. The company also removed the word \\"tramways\\" from its title and replaced it with \\"traction\\" to reflect this change in vehicles. The Mexborough and Swinton Traction Company was born, becoming part of the British Electric Traction Group in 1931.

A nephew of Robert Guiscard through one of his sisters, he was the count of Conversano from 1072 and the lord of Brindisi and Nardò from 1070, until his death. According to Goffredo Malaterra, Geoffrey conquered most of his lands with his own energy (sua strenuitate) and without the help of the Guiscard. Thus, when, in 1067, the Guiscard demanded homage for the castle of Montepeloso, Geoffrey refused. Robert brought him to heel in the subsequent war and Geoffrey did homage. Among the other lands Geoffrey had conquered from the Byzantines were Polignano and Monopoli. Geoffrey joined his cousins Abelard and Herman, his brother Robert, and Henry, Count of Monte Sant'Angelo in the rebellion of 1079–1082, while the Guiscard was away fighting the Byzantine Empire in the Balkans. His brother died in July 1080 and Abelard a year later. While he was besieging Oria, a city on the Via Appia between Brindisi and Taranto, Robert returned at Otranto and began to march towards him. Geoffrey, though he had numerous troops, fled anyway. By 1083, Geoffrey was reconciled to Robert Guiscard and accompanied him on his final Byzantine expedition. He was present at the synod held in Melfi in 1089. He was a patron of the local monasteries. Geoffrey died, most likely in Brindisi, in 1100 or 1101. He left three sons and a daughter: Robert, Alexander, Tancred, and Sybilla, who married Robert Curthose, duke of Normandy. Sources *Lexikon de Mittelalters. *Norwich, John Julius.

The two stations were CBS Radio Network affiliates, airing its schedule of dramas, comedies, news, sports, soap operas, game shows and big band broadcasts during the \\"Golden Age of Radio.\\" In 1958, KIRO-TV signed on the air as Seattle's CBS Television affiliate, which it still is today (with exception of a hiatus from 1995 to 1997, when it was a UPN station). As network programming moved from radio to television, KIRO-AM-FM switched to a full service middle of the road format of pop music, news and sports. In 1963, Queen City Broadcasting, owned by Saul Haas, was sold to Bonneville International, a broadcasting corporation set up by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).Broadcasting Yearbook 1964 page B-172 =KSEA and KWMX= In the late 1960s, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) began requiring FM stations in large cities to stop full time simulcasts of their co-owned AM stations. For a few years, KIRO-FM aired a Progressive Rock format, beginning in 1967. The station flipped to Beautiful Music in 1971, at first keeping the KIRO-FM call sign, and then as KSEA in 1975. The format gradually evolved from mostly instrumental Beautiful Music to a mix of instrumentals and vocals as easy listening (\\"Easy 101\\") in the early 1980s.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk1zaPBQnug In the mid-1980s, as the easy listening audience was aging, KSEA moved to soft adult contemporary music.

KSEA also telecasted its audio on KIRO-TV throughout the late 1980s into the early 1990s when KIRO was off-air, mainly during sign-off time in overnights. The station shifted to hot adult contemporary as KWMX (\\"Mix 101\\") in April 1991, though this would last for only a short time. 1991 KWMX TV commercial =Return to KIRO-FM= On September 21, 1992, the station returned to a simulcast of then-sister station KIRO. With the change, the KIRO-FM call letters were reinstated. The station broke the simulcast (except for mornings) on July 5, 1994, airing a separately programmed talk format, while retaining the KIRO-FM call sign. The initial lineup included a simulcast of 710 KIRO in morning drive time (which would be replaced by local comedian Pat Cashman in September), Rick Enloe in late mornings (who would later be replaced by Amy Alpine), Dave Brenner and Dr. Laura Schlessinger's syndicated show in afternoons, Gil Gross (syndicated from San Francisco) in evenings), Leslie Marshall at night (who would later be replaced by Jim Bohannon), along with Bernie Ward and David Essel on weekends. =Hot Talk KQBZ= On January 6, 1995, the station rebranded as \\"100.7 The Buzz,\\" and added the syndicated Tom Leykis Show to the lineup.

By November 2005, the station's weekday lineup consisted of local personalities Robin & Maynard (who were previously on KZOK-FM) in mornings, BJ Shea in middays, Tom Leykis in afternoons, 'The Mens Room' in evenings, and John and Jeff and All-Comedy Radio in late nights, with paid and specialty programming on weekends. =The Wolf KKWF= At 8 a.m. on November 30, 2005, in the middle of \\"Robin & Maynard\\", the station began stunting with a countdown clock to Noon the same day. At that time, the station flipped to country as \\"100.7 The Wolf\\" with the new call letters KKWF. The first song played on The Wolf was \\"How Do You Like Me Now?!\\" by Toby Keith. With the flip, The Men's Room and BJ Shea moved over to sister station KISW. Tom Leykis moved over as well, but on tape delay, from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m. Entercom acquired KKWF's long-time country rival KMPS in November 2017, as a result of its merger with CBS Radio. In the immediate aftermath of the merger's completion, KMPS dropped its country format in defense of KKWF (making it the only full-market country station in the Seattle market), and ultimately flipped to soft adult contemporary on December 4, 2017.

Its generic name, Casineria, is a latinization of Cheese Bay, the site near Edinburgh, Scotland where the holotype fossil was found. When originally described in 1999, it was identified as a transitional fossil noted for its mix of basal (amphibian- like) and advanced (reptile-like) characteristics, putting it at or very near the origin of the amniotes, the group containing all mammals, birds, modern reptiles, and other descendants of their reptile-like common ancestor. However, the sole known fossil is lacking key elements such as a skull, making exact analysis difficult.Monastersky, R. (1999): Out of the Swamps, How early vertebrates established a foothold—with all 10 toes—on land, Science News vol. 155, No. 21, p. 328 As a result, the classification of Casineria has been more controversial in analyses conducted since 1999. Other proposed affinities include a placement among the lepospondyls, seymouriamorphs, \\"gephyrostegids\\", or as a synonym of Caerorhachis, another controversial tetrapod which may have been an early temnospondyl. Description Restoration Casineria was a small animal with a postcrania length estimated to have been 15 centimeters. Its small size would have made it ideal for hunting the invertebrates of the Carboniferous. Casineria had five fingers, with the bones at the finger tip being tapering and curved. This spurred the initial describers to argue that it was the oldest known animal with claws on each hand, and marks the earliest clawed foot. Claws are extremely rare among amphibians, but ubiquitous among amniotes, so their supposed presence in Casineria has been considered to be evidence towards its amniote identity. Claws are also a feature intimately bound to the formation of keratinous scales in reptiles, so in life, Casineria would have borne scaly, reptilian-type skin, and would have resembled a small lizard (despite being completely unrelated to true lizards).Alibardi, L. (2008): Microscopic analysis of lizard claw morphogenesis and hypothesis on its evolution. Acta Zoologica: Morphology and Evolution, vol 89 (2): pp 169–178. abstract Under the hypothesis that it was among the first amniotes in the biological sense, it would have laid an amniotic egg not dependent on being laid in water to survive, possibly hiding them in damp vegetation or hollowed out tree stumps. This has been inferred from the fact that Casineria was found in rocks showing a rather dry environment. In the early Carboniferous period before the appearance of Casineria, vertebrates were primarily aquatic, only spending part of their time on land. Casineria was believed to be among the first vertebrates to live and reproduce on land. However, later studies have not consistently placed Casineria as an early amniote. Even the presence of claws has been considered doubtful, as Marjanovic & Laurin (2019) noted that the finger tips were squared-off, rather than pointed. Discovery Location of Cheese Bay in Great Britain In 1992, an amateur fossil collector spotted the remnants of this four-legged creature on the shore of Cheese Bay, Scotland. For the next five years, the fossil languished at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh while researchers focused on other projects. Consisting of a slab and counterslab (compression fossil) of a single partial skeleton, the fossil was cataloged with the specimen designation NMS G.1993.54.1. Around 1997, work began to expose the remainder of the fossil from the surrounding matrix. The work revealed that the animal probably lived in an environment much drier than previously understood. The findings were first reported in the April 8, 1999 edition of Nature. Classification While retaining a general build like those found in the amphibian reptiliomorph groups like Seymouriamorpha and Diadectomorpha, Casineria also shows features that tie it in with early reptiles, notably a generally gracile build with light leg bones, unfused ankles and toes terminating in claws. This would enable the animal to use their feet actively in traction, rather than as holdfasts, an indication of a primarily terrestrial lifestyle. These traits have been argued to show that it was more closely related to amniotes than to other known reptiliomorph amphibians. With its advanced features, Casineria may have been one of the first true amniotes, and thus the first reptile under traditional classification. In phylogenetic parlance it would have been a stem amniote, close to, but outside the crown group Amniota (the group consisting of the last common ancestor of synapsids and sauropsids and all its descendants). Casineria pushes back the origin of amniote lineages much earlier than was previously assumed. However, like with much of the basal tetrapod stock, the phylogenetic position is uncertain, and it has also been suggested Casineria is a lepospondyl, seymouriamorph, synonymous with Caerorhachis (which is possibly a basal temnospondyl amphibian),Chapter 6: \\"Walking with early tetrapods: evolution of the postcranial skeleton and the phylogenetic affinities of the Temnospondyli (Vertebrata: Tetrapoda).\\" In: Kat Pawley (2006). \\"The postcranial skeleton of temnospondyls (Tetrapoda: temnospondyli).\\" PhD Thesis.

Berlinite AlPO4 is isoelectronic with Si2O4, silicon dioxide. Berlinite looks like quartz and has a structure that is similar to quartz with silicon replaced by Al and P. The AlO4 and PO4 tetrahedra alternate. Like quartz, AlPO4 exhibits chirality and piezoelectric properties.Crystal growth of an α-quartz like piezoelectric material, berlinite, Motchany A.

P., Annales de Chimie Science des Materiaux properties, 2001, 26, 199 Crystalline AlPO4 (berlinite) when heated, converts to tridymite and cristobalite forms, and this mirrors the behaviour of silicon dioxide. Uses =Molecular sieves= There are many of aluminium phosphate molecular sieves, generically known as \\"ALPOs\\". The first ones were reported in 1982. They all share the same chemical composition of AlPO4 and have framework structures with microporous cavities. The frameworks are made up of alternating AlO4 and PO4 tetrahedra. The denser cavity-less crystalline berlinite, shares the same alternating AlO4 and PO4 tetrahedra. The aluminophosphate framework structures vary one from another in the orientation of the AlO4 tetrahedra and PO4 tetrahedra to form different-sized cavities, and in this respect they are similar to the aluminosilicate zeolites, which differ in having electrically charged frameworks. A typical preparation of an aluminophosphate involves the hydrothermal reaction of phosphoric acid and aluminium in the form of hydroxide, an aluminium salt such as aluminium nitrate salt or alkoxide under controlled pH in the presence of organic amines. These organic molecules act as templates (now termed structure directing agents, SDAs) to direct the growth of the porous framework. =Other= Along with aluminium hydroxide, aluminium phosphate is one of the most common immunologic adjuvants (efficiency enhancers) in vaccinations. Aluminium adjuvant use is widespread due to their cheap price, long history of use, safety and efficiency with most antigens. Its unknown how such salts function as adjuvants. Similar to aluminum hydroxide, AlPO4 is used as an antacid. It neutralizes stomach acid (HCl) by forming AlCl3 with it. Up to 20% of aluminum from ingested antacid salts can be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract – despite of some unverified concerns about the neurological effects of aluminum, aluminum phosphate and hydroxide salts are thought to be safe as antacids in normal use, even during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Additional uses for AlPO4 in combination with or without other compounds are white colorants for pigments, corrosion inhibitors, cements and dental cements. Related compounds have also similar uses. For example, Al(H2PO4)3 is used in dental cements, metal coatings, glaze compositions and refractory binders; and Al(H2PO4)(HPO4) is used cement and refractory binders and adhesives.Corbridge, p. 1025 Related compounds AlPO4·2H2O dihydrate is found as the minerals variscite and meta-variscite.

The contingent vote is an electoral system used to elect a single representative in which a candidate requires a majority of votes to win. It is a variation of instant-runoff voting (IRV). Under the contingent vote, the voter ranks the candidates in order of preference, and the first preference votes are counted. If no candidate has a majority (more than half the votes cast), then all but the two leading candidates are eliminated and the votes received by the eliminated candidates are distributed among the two remaining candidates according to voters preferences. This ensures that one candidate achieves a majority and is declared elected. The contingent vote differs from IRV which allows for many rounds of counting, eliminating only one weakest candidate each round. The contingent vote can also be considered a compressed form of the two-round system (runoff system), in which both 'rounds' occur without the need for voters to go to the polls twice. Today, a special variant of the contingent vote is used to elect the President of Sri Lanka. Another variant, called the supplementary vote, is used to pick directly elected mayors and police and crime commissioners in England. In the past the ordinary form of the contingent vote was used to elect the Legislative Assembly of Queensland from 1892 to 1942. To date, this has been the longest continuous use of the system anywhere in the world. It was also used in the US state of Alabama in the 1920s. Voting and counting optional preferential ballot paper. In an election held using the contingent vote the voters rank the list of candidates in order of preference. Under the most common ballot layout, they place a '1' beside their most preferred candidate, a '2' beside their second most preferred, and so on. In this respect the contingent vote is the same as instant-runoff voting. There are then a maximum of two rounds of counting. In the first round only first preferences are counted. If a candidate has received an absolute majority of first preferences (i.e. more than half) then he or she is immediately declared the winner. However, if no candidate has an absolute majority then all but the two candidates with the most first preferences are eliminated, and there is a second round. In the second round the votes of the voters whose first preference had been eliminated are transferred to whichever of the two remaining candidates were ranked the highest. The votes are then counted and whichever candidate has an absolute majority is declared elected. Impact on factions and candidates Like Instant runoff voting, the two round system, the goal of the contingent vote is to enable a majority of voters to confirm the winner of an election. The majority requirement encourages candidates to seek support beyond their core base of supporters in order to secure the lower preferences of the supporters of other candidates. This is said to create a more conciliatory campaigning style among candidates with similar policy platforms. However this effect will be diminished by the fact that lower preferences are less important under the contingent vote than under IRV; under the contingent vote it is especially important for candidates to receive many first preferences so that they are not eliminated straight away. Compared to plurality voting, the contingent vote does aid the chances of 'third party' candidates to some extent, as voters do not need to be afraid a vote for a third party will spoil the election for a stronger party candidate, as long as their second preference candidate can make the top-two requirement.  Variants  The Supplementary Vote and Sri Lankan contingent vote are two implemented variation in which voters, differently from the ordinary form of the contingent vote, cannot rank all of the candidates, but rather are only permitted to express two and three ranks of preferences, respectively. This means that if a voter does not use any of his or her preferences to support one of the candidates who survives to the second round, then it will be impossible to transfer that vote, which is therefore 'wasted' or 'exhausted'. = Sri Lankan contingent vote = In Sri Lanka, a variant of the contingent vote electoral system is used to elect the president. As under the conventional contingent vote, in an election held using the Sri Lankan form of the contingent vote each voter ranks the candidates in order of preference, and if no candidate receives an overall majority of first preference votes on the first count then all but the two leading candidates are eliminated and their votes redistributed to help determine a winner in a second and final round. However, whereas under the ordinary form of the contingent vote voters can rank all of the candidates in order of preference, under Sri Lankan CV the voter only expresses his or her top three preferences. Sri Lankan CV has been used for presidential elections there since 1982. Similar systems =Two-round system= Under the two- round system (also known as runoff voting and the second ballot) voters vote for only a single candidate, rather than ranking candidates in order of preference. As under the contingent vote, if no candidate has an absolute majority in the first round, all but the top two are eliminated and there is a second round. However, in the two round system, voters are asked to return and vote a second time. Because of the similarities between them, the contingent vote and the two-round system can usually be expected to elect the same winner. However, in the two-round system, the voter is permitted to change one's mind from one round to another, even if the favourite candidate in the first round has not been eliminated. = Nonpartisan blanket primary = The nonpartisan blanket primary is a variation of the two-round system except the first round does not pick a winner, but instead picks the two highest candidates who will compete in the general election. Because the first round does not pick a winner, there will tend to be higher voter turnout in the second election. The contingent vote will generally pick the same winner as a blanket primary, except fewer voters in the primary round may lead to a different top-two candidates than if the whole electorate voted in both rounds. = Instant-runoff voting = As noted above, the instant-runoff voting (or alternative vote) differs from the contingent vote in that it permits several rounds rather than just two. Under the alternative vote only candidate(s) for whom it is mathematically impossible to win are eliminated after each round, and as many rounds occur as are necessary to give one candidate an absolute majority. These differences mean that the contingent vote and alternative vote can produce different results. Because, under the contingent vote, all but two candidates are eliminated in the first round, it is possible for a candidate to be eliminated who would have gone on to win had he been allowed to receive transfers in later rounds.

Founded in 1973 by Mary Gregory Jewett and others, the Trust is committed to preserving and enhancing Georgia's communities and their diverse historic resources for the education and enjoyment of all. The Georgia Trust generates community revitalization by finding buyers for endangered properties acquired by its Revolving Fund; encourages neighborhood revitalization and provides design assistance to 105 Georgia Main Street cities; trains Georgia's teachers to engage students in 61 Georgia school systems to discover state and national history through their local historic resources; and advocates for funding, tax incentives and other laws aiding preservation efforts. The Georgia Trust is a recipient of the Trustees Award for Organizational Excellence from the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Rhodes Hall serves as the headquarters for the Georgia Trust. The Georgia Trust operates two historic house museums: * Hay House, 1859, Macon * Rhodes Hall, 1904, Atlanta  Georgia Trust Programs  In addition to providing preservation resources for individuals and communities throughout the state, The Georgia Trust helps save endangered houses and buildings, uncover the beauty of downtown buildings, educate the next preservation generation, and advocate for preservation funding and laws through the following programs: = Revolving Fund for Endangered Properties = The Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation established the Revolving Fund for endangered properties in 1990 to provide effective alternatives to demolition or neglect of architecturally and historically significant properties by promoting rehabilitation and enabling owners of endangered historic properties to connect with buyers who will rehabilitate their properties. The Revolving Fund accomplishes this goal by either accepting property donations or by purchasing options on endangered historic properties. The properties are then marketed nationally to locate buyers who agree to preserve and maintain the structures. Protective covenants are attached to the deeds to ensure that the historic integrity of each property is retained, and purchasers are required to sign rehabilitation agreements based on the work to be performed on the structure. = Main Street Design Assistance Program = Since the Main Street program's start in 1980, The Georgia Trust has offered design assistance, on-site rehabilitation consultations, hands-on presentations and hand-drawn and digital renderings to help business owners and downtown managers rehabilitate and reuse their historic resources. Services provided by The Georgia Trust's Main Street Design Assistance Program have become integral to downtown revitalization efforts. Supported by the Department of Community Affairs' (DCA) Office of Downtown Development, the program has assisted more than 3,000 business owners in 105 Main Street cities across Georgia to encourage the rehabilitation of historic downtown commercial buildings. = Talking Walls = A recipient of a Governor's Award in the Humanities, the Talking Walls heritage education program has trained more than 1,700 teachers, who have reached more than 370,000 students in 61 school systems in Georgia since 1991. The program's teacher workshops and ongoing local support trains educators to use local historic resources such as photos, maps, oral histories and historic buildings as teaching tools in Georgia's mandated curriculum. The Georgia Department of Education recently emphasized the Trust's key role as an important educational resource by approving the Trust as a partner in its Educational Initiatives Program. This status recognizes The Georgia Trust as an official collaborator with the DOE to provide quality instructional materials to educators across the state. Talking Walls also received statewide certification by the Georgia DOE, allowing the Trust to award professional recertification credits to teachers attending program workshops. = Georgians for Preservation Action = Founded in 1987, the statewide coordinating council for historic preservation advocacy encourages laws, programs and policies that promote the preservation of Georgia's historic resources by mobilizing grassroots preservationists across the state. Among its activities, GaPA: * Annually develops and advocates a legislative agenda that represents a consensus of the leaders of key preservation constituencies on preservation issues. * Regularly communicates with historic preservation advocates about critical issues and legislation before the General Assembly. * Hosts a Legislative Reception for preservation supporters to meet with legislators. * Provides GaPA members with information on national preservation issues with news from the National Trust for Historic Preservation and Preservation Action, the national lobbying arm for historic preservation.  Places in Peril  The Georgia Trust releases an annual list of endangered historic sites throughout Georgia. The Places in Peril program seeks to identify significant historic, archaeological and cultural properties that are threatened by demolition, deterioration or insensitive public policy or development, and have a demonstrable level of community interest, commitment and support. Through this program, the Trust encourages owners and individuals, organizations and communities to employ preservation tools, partnerships and resources necessary to preserve and utilize selected historic properties in peril. Historic properties are selected for listing based on several criteria. Sites must be listed or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places or the Georgia Register of Historic Places and must be subject to a serious threat to their existence or historical, architectural and/or archeological integrity. There must also be a demonstrable level of community commitment and support for the preservation of listed sites.

Neel Reid (and his partners in Hentz, Reid & Adler) founded the Georgia school of classicists after study at Columbia University and abroad. Many sources influenced Reid's architecture, and his interior and garden designs. His travel diary, sketchbooks and scrapbooks, and extensive library reflect this. His early-twentieth-century interest in historic preservation and contextual design, in architectural education and professional standards of practice inspired others long after his tragic early death of a brain tumor in 1926. Reid's father's family were Troup County, Georgia, pioneers; he grew up in Macon, beginning apprenticeship and practice there before, in 1909, moving to Atlanta. J. Neel Reid, Architect by William R. Mitchell, Jr. and published by The Georgia Trust, gives new life to Reid's rich legacy, keeping his influence fresh in this new century. The J. Neel Reid Prize, provided by a Georgia Trust fund produced from the sale of the book, helps ensure continuation of Reid's influence among a new generation of architects. Proceeds from book sales help support the J. Neel Reid Prize, a yearly award to an architecture student, an architect intern or a recently registered architect for study travel that honors the legacy of Neel Reid. = Democracy Restored: A History of the Georgia State Capitol = Written by Timothy J. Crimmins and Anne H. Farrisee with photographs by Diane Kirkland, the award- winning Democracy Restored is a stunning and fully illustrated history of the Georgia Capital that not only pays tribute to a grand ole edifice, but also vividly recounts the history that was made—and that continues to be made—within and without its walls. The Georgia Capitol is a place where, for more than a century, legislators have debated, governors have proclaimed, and courts have ruled. It is also a place where countless ordinary citizens have gathered in lively tour groups, angry protest mobs, and at times, solemn funeral processions. Proceeds go to The Georgia Trust and the Capitol Restoration Fund.  See also  * National Trust for Historic Preservation * There are other state historic preservation organizations nationwide.

Albertyn is notable for being the first South African competitor to win an FIM motocross world championship. He won three FIM world championships and one American national championship during his racing career. He is now a real estate developer in Riverside, California, United States. Biography Born in Johannesburg, South Africa, Albertyn won several South African and Dutch national motocross championships before moving onto the World Motocross Championship Grands Prix. Based in Europe, Albertyn and Belgian Stefan Everts had a fierce rivalry in the early part of their careers, with Albertyn usually getting the upper hand. Albertyn won the 125cc World Championship in 1992, and moved to the 250cc class for 1993.AMA http://www.ama-cycle.org/ Albertyn won that premier class in his first attempt. He successfully defended his championship in 1994. By that time he was already fielding offers to race in America for the AMA National motocross and supercross championships. Suzuki team manager Roger DeCoster hand picked Albertyn to return his team to the top. Supercross racing was completely foreign to Albertyn, and as he crashed his way through that series, his injuries hampered him for the outdoors where he was expected to shine. He did score a handful of podiums, showing his potential. 1996 was more of the same, with Albertyn only scoring a handful of top ten finishes in supercross. However, he did manage to stay relatively injury-free, and by the time the outdoors rolled around, Albertyn scored his first win at Unadilla and a few more podiums. Teamed with Jeremy McGrath on Suzuki for 1997, Albertyn greatly improved his supercross technique, and had finally begun to adapt.Racer X Online http://www.racerxonline.com/ He won the Supercross season opener in Los Angeles, and scored many other podium finishes. He won the Hangtown National and was very competitive outdoors, but DNFs riddled his season. For '98, Albertyn improved his consistency to finish second outdoors behind Doug Henry. 1999 would be Albertyn's greatest year. In one of the most competitive AMA National Championships ever, Albertyn bested Kevin Windham, Mike LaRocco, Doug Henry, Ezra Lusk, Jeff Emig, Sebastien Tortelli, Mickael Pichon, Jimmy Button and John Dowd to earn his first AMA title. It was the first premier- class championship for Suzuki in almost 20 years. Albertyn broke his femur at the 2000 Atlanta supercross. He hastily returned to defend his outdoor title with the rod still in his freshly healed bone. He was very competitive, but could not hold off the emergence of Ricky Carmichael. Albertyn announced his retirement at the end of the season. Albertyn appeared as a playable character in the 2002 motorcross video game Freekstyle. Today he works as a real-estate developer, and still rides regularly. Albertyn was one of the original investors in Pole Position Raceway,Pole Position Raceway Site http://www.polepositionraceway.com a chain of indoor go kart tracks created by Ken Faught and Jason Williams. Periodically, he comes out of retirement to race select events. In the last 3 years, he's scored top ten finishes in every one of his outings, such as the 2003 Glen Helen National and the 2004 South African Grand Prix.

Its members lived for five years in Los Angeles, California and moved back to Brazil in 2006. The band was formed in 1997 by singer/guitarist Gustavo Drummond, drummer Jean Dolabella and bassist Ian Dolabella (Jean's brother) under the name Diesel and was one of the biggest names in the Belo Horizonte underground music scene. Shortly after guitarist Leo Marques joined and around 1999 Ian left the band for being contrary to the exposure they were having, being replaced by bassist Thiago Correa, nicknamed TC. In 2001, the band gained nationwide exposure after winning, through a battle of the bands-style contest, a spot on the main stage of the Rock in Rio 3 festival. They opened the last day of the festival, performing alongside bands like Deftones, Silverchair and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. In August 2001, the band decided to move to Los Angeles in an attempt to break into the US market. The name Diesel was dropped to avoid conflict with Diesel jeans. After playing several shows in small local clubs, they were signed to J Records and went into the studio with producer Matt Wallace to record their first album as Udora, Liberty Square. After a lengthy tour of the US supporting former Alice in Chains guitarist Jerry Cantrell, J Records merged with RCA. The change in management was not well received by the bandIndiePodcasting.com – Music Podcasting and Promotion for Unsigned and Indie Bands and they chose to sever their ties with the label. In 2006, singer/guitarist Gustavo Drummond announced that drummer Jean Dolabella was leaving the band, citing \\"irreconcilable differences, both personal and musical\\" as the motive of his departure. Due to Jean's departure, their tour in Brazil scheduled for May 2006 was canceled. A few months later, Dolabella joined Sepultura, replacing Igor Cavalera on drums.Jam Sessions – Jamari França: O Globo Online Drummond decided to return to Brazil and record a new Udora album with songs in Portuguese named Goodbye, Alô.Rolling Stone Brasil, April 2006 He was joined by bassist Daniel Debarry, who replaced Thiago Correa, and drummer Paulo Henrique Braga, nicknamed PH.TramaVirtual The band promoted the album throughout Brazil and got moderate radio airplay while signing a deal with major Brazilian record label Som Livre to re-release their first fully Portuguese work nationally. They enjoyed moderate success with songs being played on national TV teen shows such as Malhação, on Globo TV. Around 2009, Leo Marques left the band to pursue other musical goals and guitarist, songwriter and long time mate of Drummond's Marcelo Mercedo joined the band. Marcelo also co-wrote a few songs with Drummond on their Brazilian début Goodbye, Alô. With yet another lineup, the band regrouped to record their fourth album, Belle Époque, heavily influenced by pop music and a dramatic departure from their first work as Diesel. The album took about 2 and a half years to be produced and recorded and was finally released on August 15, 2011. Although with a new work, the band decided not to launch a tour to support the album and are currently playing small but sparse gigs in their hometown Belo Horizonte. Gustavo Drummond is currently setting up to record his first solo effort, having already released a few demos on his MySpace. According to him, all songs are already written and ready to be recorded.

The gold was particularly crucial to the U.S. women's team as it was the only gold medal awarded to them during the games. Boglioli also won the bronze medal in the women's 100-meter butterfly, behind East German swimmers Kornelia Ender and Andrea Pollack. During the 1990s, it was confirmed that Ender and Pollack were given performance-enhancing drugs during the East German doping scandal of the 1970s. Therefore, Boglioli most likely would have won the gold medal, were it not for the presence of Ender and Pollack. Life after the Olympics Boglioli served as assistant coach of the Yale Bulldogs swimming and diving team at Yale University, together with her husband Bernie Boglioli. In 1979, the Supersisters trading card set was produced and distributed; one of the cards featured Boglioli's name and picture. Boglioli began competitive track cycling at the age of 40. She competed in the 1995 and 1996 U.S. Masters Track Cycling National Championship where she earned a total of 8 Gold Medals.(USA Masters Track Cycling, USCF).

Often abbreviated HN1, it is a powerful vesicant and a nitrogen mustard gas used for chemical warfare. HN1 was developed in the 1920s and 1930s to remove warts and later as a military agent. Because of the latter use, it is a Schedule 1 chemical within the Chemical Weapons Convention and therefore use and production is strongly restricted. It has never been used in warfare.The Emergency Response Safety and Health Database: NITROGEN MUSTARD HN-1. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Accessed March 19, 2009. It is an oily liquid with a colorless to pale yellow appearance and a faint fishy or musty odor. HN1 is also an alkylating agent.The Emergency Response Safety and Health Database: NITROGEN MUSTARD HN-1. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Accessed March 19, 2009. Reactions Nitrogen mustards react via an initial cyclization to the corresponding aziridinium salt. The rate of this reaction is pH dependent because the protonated amine cannot cyclize. The aziridinium ion reacts with water in a slower reaction. At pH 8, the nitrogen mustards are essentially quantitatively converted to the aziridinium ion for subsequent slow reaction with water. In contrast, at pH 4 cyclization and hydrolysis show the classic form of reactions in series. Hydrolysis of HN1 produces toxic intermediates.The Emergency Response Safety and Health Database: NITROGEN MUSTARD HN-1. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Accessed March 19, 2009. HN1 reacts with iron alloys, corroding them at and above 65 °C (149 °F), and reacts with metals in general, producing hydrogen gas. This can potentially cause explosions.The Emergency Response Safety and Health Database: NITROGEN MUSTARD HN-1. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Accessed March 19, 2009.  Toxicity  Because HN1 is an alkylating agent, it damages DNA, causes immunosuppression, and causes injury to areas that come into contact with it. Exposure to HN1 can be fatal, and its effects on skin and mucous membranes are worsened when they are moist. The alkylation effects cause damage to the spleen, bone marrow, and lymph nodes, which causes anemia, low white cell counts, and internal bleeding. The vesicant effects cause blistering and damage to the skin.The Emergency Response Safety and Health Database: NITROGEN MUSTARD HN-1. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Accessed March 19, 2009. The symptoms of exposure depend on the route of exposure. Eye exposure to vapor can cause lacrimation (tears), blepharospasm (eyelid twitching), irritation, itching, burning pain, dry feeling, and sometimes miosis (pinpoint pupils). More severe vapor exposure can also cause swelling and fluid buildup (edema) in the eyelids, increased pain, and redness. Very severe exposure to vapor or exposure to liquid can cause photophobia (aversion to light), corneal ulceration, and blindness.The Emergency Response Safety and Health Database: NITROGEN MUSTARD HN-1. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Accessed March 19, 2009. Inhaling the vapor causes symptoms that begin in the upper airway and expand to the lower airway. Increased concentrations cause worse symptoms. Mild inhalation exposure causes rhinorrhea (runny nose), sneezing, barking cough (a harsh cough that sounds somewhat like a dog barking), epistaxis (nosebleed), dyspnea (shortness of breath) that affects smokers and asthmatics, hoarseness that turns into toneless voice, ageusia (loss of taste), and anosmia (loss of smell); later on, sinus and nose pain develops. With more severe inhalation exposure, the airway becomes inflamed, pneumonia develops, and the respiratory epithelium can begin to have necrosis and slough off, forming a pseudomembrane that can occlude the airway. This occlusion can be fatal, as can the pneumonia.The Emergency Response Safety and Health Database: NITROGEN MUSTARD HN-1. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Accessed March 19, 2009. Skin contact with nitrogen mustard in low concentrations causes symptoms beginning with redness, then moving to blistering, itching, and burning pain. More severe exposure can cause necrosis (cell death) in the blisters, and systemic toxicity, which causes malaise, vomiting, exhaustion, and fever. Skin exposure that causes symptoms over more than 25% of the body area is often fatal. Though ingestion is uncommon, nitrogen mustard can burn the GI tract and cause nausea, vomiting, hemorrhagic diarrhea, and abdominal pain.The Emergency Response Safety and Health Database: NITROGEN MUSTARD HN-1. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Accessed March 19, 2009. Nitrogen mustard exposure does not cause symptoms until several hours to several days afterwards, but more severe exposure causes symptoms sooner. With severe exposure, eye injury can manifest within 1-2 hours, airway damage within 2-6 hours, and skin damage within 6-12 hours (sooner in hot or humid weather). Mild exposure takes longer to manifest symptoms: eye injury within 3-12 hours, airway damage within 12-24 hours, and skin damage up to 48 hours post-exposure.The Emergency Response Safety and Health Database: NITROGEN MUSTARD HN-1. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Accessed March 19, 2009. = Long-term sequelae = Effects of nitrogen mustard exposure can be long-term or permanent; it is also a known carcinogen, reprotoxin, and developmental toxin after chronic and acute exposure, causing skin cancer and airway cancers in particular. Blindness from an acute exposure is usually temporary, resolving in days to months depending on severity. Chronic respiratory and eye infections are also common after acute nitrogen mustard exposure. Other consequences of acute exposure include ageusia, anosmia, pulmonary fibrosis, scarring, bronchitis, chronic respiratory disease, mental illness, and central nervous system damage. Consequences of chronic exposure beyond cancer include permanent kidney damage and immunosuppression.The Emergency Response Safety and Health Database: NITROGEN MUSTARD HN-1. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Accessed March 19, 2009.  Treatment  Treatment for HN1 exposure is primarily supportive, since there is no antidote. First aid involves decontamination, irrigation, removing the affected person from the source of exposure, immediate medical attention, airway management (in cases of inhalation exposure), and medical monitoring of respiratory and cardiac function. If the affected person has trouble breathing (dyspnea) or stops breathing (apnea), ventilatory support and oxygen therapy can be helpful. If HN1 has been ingested, emetics (agents that induce vomiting) and gastric lavage are contraindicated, and nothing should be consumed by mouth because they could damage the gastrointestinal system.The Emergency Response Safety and Health Database: NITROGEN MUSTARD HN-1.

In 1691 he accompanied his father on a military expedition to Moldavia where he learnt military tactics and broadened his fighting skills. At the end of his father's life, due to Sobieski's conflict with the eldest son Jakub, he was a to succeed his father to the throne, however, this never took place. In October 1696, while in Paris, he requested an audition with Louis XIV as the marquis of Jarosław. On January 19, 1698, together with his brother, Konstanty Władysław Sobieski, he organized a ball in Warsaw, in the honor of the newly crowned king Augustus II the Strong. Sobieski often accompanied Augustus II on military expeditions, most notably during the September campaign against the Tatars. He later became a close friend and supporter of the king. He was also known to be very fond of the monarch. In October, the same year, Sobieski personally escorted his mother on her trip to Italy.http://www.wilanow- palac.pl/sobieski_aleksander_benedykt_stanislaw.html In November, they were received by Emperor Leopold I and Eleonora Magdalena von Pfalz-Neuburg. Politics and military career In March, 1700, he arrived in Rome and was made a Knight of the Order of St. Michael. In December, from the hands of the French ambassador, then Prince Louis of Monaco, he received the Order of the Holy Spirit. In summer of 1702, Charles de Caradas, the Marquis du Heron, a member of the Sejm (parliament) in Poland, suggested that Alexander should be seated on the throne of Hungary. Later that year the prince remained in Oława and he didn't accompany his brothers in an expedition to Saxony, however he did travel to Wrocław where he had an affair with the former mistress of Augustus II Anna Aloysia Esterle. Aleksander fought at the side of Charles XII during his campaign in Saxony, in 1706. After the release of his brothers under the terms of the Treaty of Altranstädt, he halted his engagement in politics.http://www.wilanow- palac.pl/sobieski_aleksander_benedykt_stanislaw.html The arts, later life and death In 1710 he settled in Rome. Still in 1709, under the pseudonym Armonte Calidio, he joined the Roman academy Arcadia and the congregation of writers, artists and scholars. During the meetings held in the Arcadian Roman Mansion he often recited his own poetry written in Latin. Aleksander throughout his life was passionate about theater. He created his own version of the Arcadian dramma nobile. In the years 1710-1713 he completed the composition of several operas, in collaboration with the composer Domenico Scarlatti and set designer Filippo Juvarra. Occasionally, he starred in his plays.http://www.wilanow-palac.pl/sobieski_aleksander_benedykt_stanislaw.html A ship from Gdańsk, Printz Alexander von Pohlen, was named after him.

It airs a classic rock radio format and is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc. KZOK's transmitter is located near Issaquah, Washington, on Tiger Mountain, and operates from studios in Seattle in the Belltown neighborhood northwest of Downtown. KZOK-FM broadcasts in HD. History =KTW-FM= In December 1964, the station signed on as KTW-FM.Broadcasting Yearbook 1966 page B-163 It was owned by David Segal, who called his format \\"The Wonderful Sound of Seattle.\\" At first, it mostly simulcast co-owned AM 1250 KTW (now KKDZ). The station's formats in its early years included Top 40 for nine months, then a country music format called \\"The Nashville Sound.\\" KTW-FM, along with KTW (AM), was acquired by Norwood and Dawn Patterson of Central California. Nordawn, Inc. switched the stations to a \\"paid religion\\" format. In 1970, the stations were put into court-ordered receivership, administered by attorney Walter Webster, Jr. Norwood J. Patterson was sentenced to two years in federal prison for failure to pay the government employee withholding taxes. He also sabotaged both AM and FM transmitters the afternoon that the stations were placed in receivership by driving to the West Seattle transmitter site and pulling the \\"finals.\\" He failed to check the engineering locker where spares were located. In 1974, KTW-FM stopped simulcasting the AM station and changed to progressive rock, while also changing call letters to KZOK-FM. The FM station was sold to the Sterling Recreation Organization with AM 1250 sold off to Don Dudley, owner of KYAC. SRO would then pair KZOK with AM 1590 KUUU, which aired an oldies format. In August 1975, KZOK moved from its free-form progressive sound to a more mass-appeal and better-researched AOR format. With the success of KZOK's rock sound on FM, in 1982, the AM station switched to a different rock format, modern rock, allowing KZOK's advertisers to have two choices for their commercials aimed at Seattle's rock audience. The AM station was renamed KJET.Broadcasting Yearbook 1983 page B-262 =Move to Classic Rock= In 1985, KZOK tried moving to a more adult soft rock/adult album alternative format, but with a dip in the ratings, the station shifted to classic rock in October of the following year. Adams Communications bought the stations in 1989. Adams would rename the AM station KZOK (AM), subscribing to the satellite-delivered syndicated \\"Z Rock Network.\\" In November 1992, Adams Communications filed for bankruptcy, selling KZOK-AM-FM to CLG Media, a subsidiary of the Chrysler Capital Corporation. In July 1994, CLG Media sold KZOK-FM to EZ Communications, while KZOK-AM was sold to Salem Communications to carry its religious programming as KPOZ. In July 1997, EZ was bought out by American Radio Systems. Westinghouse/CBS bought American Radio Systems' stations (including KZOK) on September 19, 1997. In June 1998, CBS split off the radio division under the revived Infinity Broadcasting name, which would be renamed CBS Radio in December 2005. In 2011, KZOK-FM hired actor and radio personality Danny Bonaduce to host its morning show. Bonaduce had been a child actor, seen in the classic TV sitcom The Partridge Family in the 1970s. =Sale to iHeartMedia= On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom (which locally owns KHTP, KISW, KKWF, and KNDD). CBS Radio to Merge with Entercom On October 10, CBS announced that as part of the process of obtaining regulatory approval of the merger, KZOK would be one of sixteen stations that would be divested by Entercom, along with sister stations KJAQ and KFNQ. (KMPS would be retained by Entercom.) On November 1, 2017, iHeartMedia announced that it will acquire KZOK-FM, KJAQ and KFNQ. To meet ownership limits set by the FCC, KFNY (formerly KFOO) and KTDD (formerly KUBE) were divested to the Ocean Stations Trust in order to be sold to a different owner.

The cell bodies of invertebrate unipolar neurons are often located around the edges of the neuropil, in the so-called cell-body rind. Most neurons in the central nervous systems of vertebrates, including mammals, are multipolar. In multipolar neurons, multiple processes extend from the cell body including dendrites and axons. Some neurons in the vertebrate brain have a unipolar morphology: a notable example is the unipolar brush cell, found in the cerebellum and granule region of the dorsal cochlear nucleus. A third morphological class, bipolar neurons, extend just one axon and dendritic process from the cell body. Examples of bipolar neurons include most invertebrate sensory neurons and bipolar cells of the vertebrate retina. Some vertebrate sensory neurons are classified as pseudo-unipolar. Pseudo-unipolar neurons initially develop as bipolar cells, but at some point the two processes that extend from the cell body fuse to form a single neurite. The axon then splits into two branches.

The son of John III Sobieski, King of Poland, and his wife, Marie Casimire Louise de la Grange d'Arquien, Sobieski married Maria Józefa Wessel in 1708.http://www.wilanow- palac.pl/sobieski_konstanty_wladyslaw_2.html Early life and career Konstanty Władysław Sobieski was the youngest son of John III Sobieski. His first tutor was Karlo Mauricio Vota, a Jesuit. Later his teacher became Remigian Suszycki from the University of Cracow and \\"chevelier de Neufmaison\\", who taught him about military. Konstanty also learned Italian and French. After the king’s death, he almost always accompanied his mother and brother Aleksander Benedykt. In 1698, after the division of his father’s estates, Konstanty received, most notably, the Żółkiew property, Wilanów Palace and the Kazimierz Palace in Warsaw. In the course of her stay in Rome, queen Marie Casimire planned to obtain a cardinal’s hat for Konstanty. Her intentions were thwarted by the uninhibited behaviour of the prince who, while visiting his mother in 1701, got involved in an affair with Tolla, a Roman beauty also adored by Duke Gaetan Sforza, who wounded her in front of the Sobieski mansion, a deed for which he later formally apologised. In the first years of the Great Northern War, Konstanty supported his brother Jakub’s attempts to mount the throne of Poland. In February 1704 both brothers were kidnapped and incarcerated by Augustus II the Strong. In 1706 they were set free by the victorious Charles XII of Sweden.http://www.wilanow- palac.pl/sobieski_konstanty_wladyslaw_2.html Politics, romances and later life In November 1708 Konstanty unexpectedly married, in Gdańsk, Maria Józefa Wessel, whom he probably knew from childhood. He presented his bride with a life estate contract, considerably hindering the subsequent attempts of the Sobieski family, which perceived the relationship as a misalliance, to annul the marriage. The prince had already abandoned his wife by December, leaving her in Gdańsk, and in the spring 1709 he accompanied Stanisław I to the Lwów region, where he met Elżbieta Sieniawska, a hetman’s wife, who believed that in the prevailing political situation Konstanty’s election would be preferable to Augustus II returning to the throne. In subsequent years, the prince often stayed on his brother’s estates in Oława, Wrocław and Żółkiew.http://www.wilanow-palac.pl/sobieski_konstanty_wladyslaw_2.html =Death= Suffering from rheumatism and seriously indebted, in 1725 Sobieski unexpectedly made amends with his wife, who offered him financial aid and brought him from Wrocław to Żółkiew, where he died and was buried in the parish church.

Often abbreviated HN3 or HN-3, it is a powerful blister agent and a nitrogen mustard used for chemical warfare. HN3 was the last of the nitrogen mustard agents developed. It was designed as a military agent and is the only one of the nitrogen mustards that is still used for military purposes. It is the principal representative of the nitrogen mustards because its vesicant properties are almost equal to those of HD and thus the analogy between the two types of mustard is the strongest.NITROGEN MUSTARD HN-3. Emergency Response Safety and Health Database. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. August 22, 2008. Accessed April 10, 2009. As a vesicant the use and production is strongly restricted within the Chemical Weapons Convention where it is classified as a Schedule 1 substance. Mode of action Nitrogen mustards react via an initial cyclization to the corresponding quaternary aziridine salt. The rate of this reaction is pH dependent because the protonated amine cannot cyclize. Applications HN-3 has found some applications in chemotherapy, e.g., for Hodgkin's disease, and in some compound semiconductor research but it is mainly of interest for its military uses and is the only one of these agents that remains anywhere as a military agent. These agents are more immediately toxic than the sulfur mustards. Exposure HN-3 can be absorbed into the body by inhalation, ingestion, eye contact, and skin contact (though inhalation is the most common). The chemical is extremely toxic and may damage the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract and suppress the immune system. HN-3 penetrates and binds quickly to cells of the body, but its health effects develop slowly. The full extent of cellular injury may not be known for days.

As an agency of the Ontario government, the WSIB operates \\"at arm's length\\" from the Ministry of Labour and is solely funded by employer premiums, administration fees, and investment revenue. The WSIB is one of the largest compensation boards in North America and is primarily responsible for administering and enforcing the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act (WSIA). Over 100 years old, the WSIB covers over five million people in more than 300,000 workplaces across Ontario and works to promote health and safety in the workplace with a goal of one day having zero work-related injuries or illnesses. History The Simcoe Park Workers' Monument. The bronze statue The Anonymity of Prevention is depicted wearing safety gear and working on the red granite wall sculpture, 100 Workers, on which are installed plaques of individuals who have died in workplace accidents in Ontario, one for each year of the 20th century. Sir William Meredith is regarded as the founding father of the Workers' Compensation System in Ontario, and by extension, Canada. In 1910, Ontario appointed Sir William Meredith to head the first Royal Commission to study workers' compensation systems across the world and make recommendations. In 1913, Meredith presented his findings, and one year later, the Workmen's Compensation Board (now known as the WSIB) was formed. By 1915, the Workmen's Compensation Act, sometimes referred to as the Historic Compromise was passed. The Act ensures that people are compensated for work-related injuries and occupational diseases and in turn, businesses cannot be sued by people who have become injured or ill at work. The Act was based on Sir William Meredith's five basic principles for a compassionate compensation system - still in place today, these are known as The Meredith Principles: #No-fault compensation: workers are paid benefits regardless of how the injury occurred. The worker and employer waive the right to sue. There is no argument over responsibility or liability for an injury. #Security of benefits: a fund is established to guarantee funds exist to pay benefits. #Collective liability: employers share liability for workplace injury insurance and the total cost of the compensation system. All employers contribute to a common fund. Financial liability becomes their collective responsibility. #Independent administration: organizations who administer workers’ compensation insurance are separate from government. #Exclusive jurisdiction: only workers’ compensation organizations provide workers’ compensation insurance. All compensation claims are directed solely to the compensation board. The board is the decision-maker and final authority for all claims.  Business Owners (Schedule 1 and Schedule 2)  The WSIB differentiates between two types of employers, as set out in the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act (WSIA): Schedule 1 employers are primarily private companies (i.e., construction companies) and make up approximately 309,000 employer accounts at the WSIB. These businesses require compulsory coverage and pay premiums on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. Their premiums are based on insurable earnings (employees' salaries) multiplied by a rate assigned to the business determined by the type of work they do (or their rate group). Schedule 2 employers are often public organizations (i.e., municipalities) and make up approximately 550 employer accounts at the WSIB. These employers are individually liable, meaning the WSIB pays benefits directly to people injured or ill at work under Schedule 2 and are reimbursed by their employers for the cost of those benefits and the expense of administering them (administration fee). Claims and Benefits  Every year, the WSIB receives approximately 250,000 claims and pays over $2.5 billion in benefits. Coverage can include full medical care for people injured at work and wage replacement for as long as necessary until they are able to return to work. In the event of a fatality, the WSIB works with the surviving spouse to provide financial help, assistance re-entering the workforce if necessary, and support to provide for the post-secondary education of dependent children. It is important to report and claim benefits as soon as possible. People who have experienced a workplace injury or illness have 6 months from the date of the injury to claim their benefits with the WSIB. For a workplace illness, it is generally 6 months from the date of diagnosis. Following the injury or illness, if treatment is needed from a health professional (beyond first aid), the employer is obligated to report it to the WSIB by filling out a Form 7. If the injured or ill person subsequently loses time from work, they must report the injury or illness to the WSIB by filling out and submitting a Form 6. People who are injured or become ill because of work also have rights and responsibilities under WSIA. All staff in Ontario workplaces have the right to: * Know about potential danger * Participate in making their workplace safe * Refuse unsafe work All staff in Ontario workplaces have a responsibility to: * Work safely * Report unsafe work conditions * Wear the right safety equipment for the job  The Claims Process  When a claim is reported, the WSIB registers the claim and assigns it a claim number - over 90% of eligibility claims are made within two weeks of claim registration. If the claim is allowed, the injured or ill person is contacted and the WSIB begins to collect information from the health care provider (if applicable) and the employer. At this time, the Eligibility Adjudicator will determine if a claim needs support and if it does, the claim will be sent to a dedicated team of Nurse Consultants and Return-to-Work Specialists. From here, a Case Manager, Return-to-Work Specialist and Nurse Consultant work with the workplace parties to arrange for return to work and recovery.  Financial Sustainability  After reaching a high of $14.2 billion in 2011, the WSIB eliminated its Unfunded Liability (UFL) in Q2 2018, almost 10 years ahead of the legislated deadline of December 31, 2027. The UFL was the shortage between the money needed to pay future benefits to people injured at work for all established claims, and the money that was in the insurance fund. The elimination of the UFL was accomplished as a result of: * Premiums exceeding those needed to cover claims and administrative costs * Better than expected investment returns * Fewer claims * Better recovery and return to work WSIB Leadership  The WSIB's Board of Directors is composed of the Chair, the President and CEO, and seven to nine members, who are appointed by the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario. The Board governs the WSIB on: * Workplace safety/reducing injury, disease and fatalities * Administering the insurance plan * Providing compensation and other benefits to injured workers and their survivors * Facilitating workers' recovery, return to work and re-entry into the labour market Ontario government departments and agencies 1998 establishments in Ontario Occupational safety and health organizations Government agencies established in 1998 Organizations based in Toronto Workers' compensation ","title":"Workplace Safety &amp; Insurance Board"},{"id":"5022982","text":"Kratovo may refer to: *Kratovo, North Macedonia, a town in Macedonia *Kratovo Municipality, Macedonia, which contains the town *Kratovo, Russia, an urban- type settlement in Moscow Oblast, Russia *Kratovo, Serbia, a settlement situated in the Priboj municipality of southwestern Serbia ","title":"Kratovo"},{"id":"5022986","text":"Julius Margolin (, October 14, 1900 – January 21, 1971) was a Belarus-born Israeli writer and political activist.

He had one sibling, a sister, who predeceased him. Springer, whose art influences included adventure comic strips and magazine-cover illustrations by Norman Rockwell, Dean Cornwell, and J. C. Leyendecker, went on to earn an art degree from Syracuse University in 1952, and after being drafted that year, served with the U.S. Army through 1954. Stationed at Fort Dix, he spent his service, he said, \\"drawing pictures, drawing charts and that kind of thing. ... I got a lot of training in the army in doing sports cartoons with a deadline and so on.\\" Following his discharge, he began freelancing in New York City, soon becoming assistant to cartoonist George Wunder on the comic strip Terry and the Pirates, on which Wunder had succeeded creator Milt Caniff. Springer recalled in 2008, Leaving in 1960 to freelance again, Springer entered the comic-book industry two years later to draw Dell Comics' Brain Boy, starring a telepathic government agent, in Four Color Comics #1330 (June 1962).

Springer went on to draw an issue each of Detective Comics and Our Army at War; an anthological story in another House of Mystery; and the first two issues of Secret Six -- the initial one a rare example of a comic-book beginning its story on the cover rather than on the inside page one. After that, he found more regular work at rival Marvel Comics, where he debuted on Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. #4 (Sept. 1968), a fill-in issue of writer-artist Jim Steranko's signature series. Springer penciled and inked an origin-story retelling (scripted by Roy Thomas) sandwiched between Steranko's final two issues. Springer then succeeded the departed Steranko, drawing issues #6-11 (Nov. 1968 - April 1969), with Steranko providing the covers of #6-7. Springer additionally drew Captain Marvel #13-14 (May–June 1969) and a Hercules back-up story in Ka-Zar #1 (Aug. 1970) before concentrating on his ongoing Dell work until 1973, when that company ceased publication. =Later comic books= Springer returned to draw a handful of stories for Marvel's black-and-white horror-comics magazines in 1974 and 1975, and then sprang from title to title, penciling sporadic issues of The Avengers, Captain America, The Spectacular Spider-Man, and Spider-Woman, among others, and also inked many Marvel and DC comics. He then became regular inker of Marvel's The Savage She-Hulk over penciler Mike Vosburg on issues #10-22 (Nov. 1980 - Nov. 1981). He penciled a longer run of the superheroine series Dazzler from #4-31 and 35 (June 1981 - March 1984 and Jan. 1985), plus the Dazzler stories in What If...? #34 (Aug. 1982) and Marvel Graphic Novel #12 (1984). Springer, additionally, wrote Dazzler #27-28 and co- wrote with Jim Shooter #29 (July–Nov. 1983). Springer's other 1980s comics include issues of Marvel's Conan the Barbarian and the company's toy-license titles based on the properties G.I. Joe and Transformers; and, for DC, a return to the Secret Six in Action Comics Weekly, and issues of Manhunter and Green Arrow. After a brief hiatus from comics, he returned to co-ink, with Michael Weaver, Claypool Comics' Phantom of Fear City #11-12 (Feb. and May 1995). This was his last confirmed work in comics except for a single-page profile of the DC character Perry White in Superman Secret Files #1 (Jan. 1998). Miscellanea includes the Atlas/Seaboard series Cougar in the 1970s, and Continuity Comics' Armor in the 1990s. =Adult satire= Panels from \\"The Adventures of Phoebe Zeit-Geist\\" by Springer and writer Michael O'Donoghue. With the dark-humor writer-provocateur Michael O'Donoghue, Springer from 1965 to 1966 drew \\"The Adventures of Phoebe Zeit-Geist\\" in the magazine Evergreen Review. The feature was one of the first mature-audience comics in the U.S., following the French feature \\"Barbarella\\" in Evergreen Review in 1965. Others in the vein included Playboy's \\"Little Annie Fanny\\" and Magazine Enterprises' \\"The Adventures of Pussycat\\". Unlike its innocently bawdy contemporaries, \\"Phoebe Zeit-Geist\\" had a darker, sometimes brutal edge, with scenes of bondage depicted as actual torture rather than Bettie Page-like playfulness. Evergreen Review publisher Grove Press collected the series as a 1968 book.Adventures of Phoebe Zeit-Geist at the Grand Comics Database Doonesbury comic-strip creator Garry Trudeau cited the strip as an early inspiration, saying, \\"[A] very heavy influence was a serial in the Sixties called 'Phoebe Zeitgeist'. ... It was an absolutely brilliant, deadpan send-up of adventure comics, but with a very edgy, modernist kind of approach. To this day, I hold virtually every panel in my brain. It's very hard not to steal from it.\\" Springer also drew the series \\"Frank Fleet\\" for Evergreen Review from 1969 to 1970. From 1971 to 1988 he was a regular contributor to the satiric magazine National Lampoon, occasionally using the pseudonyms Francis Hollidge and Bob Monhegan. He came to National Lampoon, he recalled, through O’Donoghue, who had joined the magazine \\"and called me up almost right away to do a piece called 'Tarzan of the Cows'. I don’t know what issue it was in, but it was one of the earlier ones. I did several other pieces for the magazine and I worked with several of the other writers, Henry Beard, Doug Kenney, Brian McConnachie; all fabulous writers. These guys were really funny and I think I did some of my best work because the writing was so good.\\" =Comic strips and cartoons= After having assisted Wunder on Terry and the Pirates from 1955 to 1960 and then moving to comic books, Springer returned to comic strips as penciler of the syndicated newspaper strip Rex Morgan, M.D. from 1979 to 1981. and He also drew The Incredible Hulk newspaper strip, starring the Marvel Comics' antihero; the romance strip The Virtue of Vera Valiant, with writer Stan Lee; and The Adventures of Hedley Kase in the 1990s. Springer's cartoon art has appeared in Games Magazine, Muppets Magazine, the New York Daily News, Playboy, Sports Illustrated for Kids, and elsewhere. In the mid-1960s, he did freelance work on the animated TV series Space Ghost, collaborating with a partner to produce \\"key drawings\\" of action for which \\"in-betweener\\" animators did connecting art. \\"It was part-time stuff, but that was enjoyable. It was a different phase of cartooning,\\" Springer recalled.Springer, Frank, in Springer also did a small amount of uncredited penciling on the comic strip The Phantom, assisting Sy Barry, and \\"for a really brief period\\" worked with writer-artist Stan Drake on The Heart of Juliet Jones. Without mentioning the strip's name, Springer said in the mid-2000s that, \\"I worked with Leonard Starr for some years doing part of that strip,\\" presumably Starrs' On Stage, later titled Mary Perkins, On Stage. \\"Leonard always handled the figures but I’d come in once a week and do the backgrounds, pick up a check and leave.\\" He additionally did uncredited work on the comic strip Friday Foster, drawn in Spain by Jorge Longarón. \\"I knew the [strip's] writer [Jim Lawrence], who lived here in New Jersey, ... [and] I got a call a couple of times from Lawrence who said they hadn’t gotten the material through from Spain\\" and Springer was asked to fill in. \\"I guess over the years I did two Sunday pages, maybe three.\\" =Later years and death = In 1980, just shy of his 51st birthday, Springer ran the New York City Marathon. In 1995, after spending the majority of his life on Long Island (mostly in the towns of Lynbrook, Massapequa Park, and Greenlawn), Springer and wife Barbara, whom he married in c. 1956-1957, moved to Maine, where the artist turned to oil painting. He said in 2004, \\"There were some raggedy times, but I always had work, raised five kids, bought some houses, bought some cars. ... I've been lucky\\". Springer at one point was president of the National Cartoonists Society, and was a founding member of the Berndt Toast Gang, its Long Island chapter. Springer died on April 2, 2009, at his home in Damariscotta, Maine, of prostate cancer. He was survived by his wife and five grown children: Barbara Edwards, Bill Springer, Jennifer Dills, Jon Springer, and Christopher Springer. Characterizing Springer, Archie comics artist Stan Goldberg said, \\"Very few people could surpass him as an artist, as a gentleman, and as a true gentleman in my field. ... When you see a Frank Springer job, you know it's going to be the best job in the world\\".

In mass spectrometry, Orbitrap is an ion trap mass analyzer consisting of an outer barrel-like electrode and a coaxial inner spindle-like electrode that traps ions in an orbital motion around the spindle. The image current from the trapped ions is detected and converted to a mass spectrum using the Fourier transform of the frequency signal. History The concept of electrostatically trapping ions in an orbit around a central spindle was developed by Kenneth Hay Kingdon in the early 1920s. The Kingdon trap consists of a thin central wire and an outer cylindrical electrode. A static applied voltage results in a radial logarithmic potential between the electrodes. In 1981, Knight introduced a modified outer electrode that included an axial quadrupole term that confines the ions on the trap axis. Neither the Kingdon nor the Knight configurations were reported to produce mass spectra. The invention of the Orbitrap analyzer and its proof-of-principle by Makarov at the end of the 1990s started a sequence of technology improvements which resulted in the commercial introduction of this analyzer by Thermo Fisher Scientific as a part of the hybrid LTQ Orbitrap instrument in 2005. Principle of operation Cross- section of the C-trap and Orbitrap analyzer (ion optics and differential pumping not shown). Ion packet enters the analyzer during the voltage ramp and form rings that induce current detected by the amplifier. = Trapping = In the Orbitrap, ions are trapped because their electrostatic attraction to the inner electrode is balanced by their inertia. Thus, ions cycle around the inner electrode on elliptical trajectories. In addition, the ions also move back and forth along the axis of the central electrode so that their trajectories in space resemble helices. Due to the properties of the quadro- logarithmic potential, their axial motion is harmonic, i.e. it is completely independent not only of motion around the inner electrode but also of all initial parameters of the ions except their mass-to-charge ratios m/z. Its angular frequency is: ω = , where k is the force constant of the potential, similar to the spring constant. = Injection = In order to inject ions from an external ion source, the field between the electrodes is first reduced. As ion packets are injected tangentially into the field, the electric field is increased by ramping the voltage on the inner electrode. Ions get squeezed towards the inner electrode until they reach the desired orbit inside the trap. At that moment ramping is stopped, the field becomes static, and detection can start. Each packet contains a multitude of ions of different velocities spread over a certain volume. These ions move with different rotational frequencies but with the same axial frequency. This means that ions of a specific mass-to-charge ratio spread into rings which oscillate along the inner spindle. Proof-of-principle of the technology was carried out using the direct injection of ions from an external laser desorption and ionization ion source. This method of injection works well with pulsed sources such as MALDI but cannot be interfaced to continuous ion sources like electrospray. All commercial Orbitrap mass spectrometers utilize a curved linear trap for ion injection (C-trap). By rapidly ramping down trapping RF voltages and applying DC gradients across the C-trap, ions can be bunched into short packets similar to those from the laser ion source. The C-trap is tightly integrated with the analyzer, injection optics and differential pumping. = Excitation = In principle, coherent axial oscillations of ion rings could be excited by applying RF waveforms to the outer electrode as demonstrated in and references therein. However, if ion packets are injected away from the minimum of the axial potential (which corresponds to the thickest part of either electrode), this automatically initiates their axial oscillations, eliminating the need for any additional excitation. Furthermore, the absence of additional excitation allows the detection process to start as soon as the detection electronics recover from the voltage ramp needed for ion injection. = Detection = Cut-outs of a standard (top) and a high-field (bottom) Orbitrap analyzer. Axial oscillations of ion rings are detected by their image current induced on the outer electrode which is split into two symmetrical pick-up sensors connected to a differential amplifier. By processing data in a manner similar to that used in Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS), the trap can be used as a mass analyzer. Like in FTICR-MS, all the ions are detected simultaneously over some given period of time and resolution can be improved by increasing the strength of the field or by increasing the detection period. The Orbitrap differs from FTICR-MS by the absence of a magnetic field and hence has a significantly slower decrease of resolving power with increasing m/z.  Variants  LTQ Orbitrap Currently the Orbitrap analyzer exists in two variants: a standard trap and a compact high- field trap. In practical traps, the outer electrode is sustained at virtual ground and a voltage of 3.5 or 5 kV is applied to the inner electrode only. As a result, the resolving power at m/z 400 and 768 ms detection time can range from 60,000 for a standard trap at 3.5 kV to 280,000 for a high-field trap at 5 kV and with enhanced FT processing. Like in FTICR-MS the Orbitrap resolving power is proportional to the number of harmonic oscillations of the ions; as a result, the resolving power is inversely proportional to the square root of m/z and proportional to acquisition time. For example, the values above would double for m/z 100 and halve for m/z 1600. For the shortest transient of 96 ms these values would be reduced by 8 times, whereas a resolving power in excess of 1,000,000 has been demonstrated in 3-second transients. The Orbitrap analyzer can be interfaced to a linear ion trap (LTQ Orbitrap family of instruments), quadrupole mass filter (Q Exactive family) or directly to an ion source (Exactive instrument, all marketed by Thermo Fisher Scientific). In addition, a higher-energy collision cell can be appended to the C-trap, with the further addition of electron-transfer dissociation at its back. Most of these instruments have atmospheric pressure ion sources though an intermediate-pressure MALDI source can also be used (MALDI LTQ Orbitrap). All of these instruments provide a high mass accuracy (<2–3 ppm with external calibrant and <1–2 ppm with internal), a high resolving power (up to 240,000 at m/z 400), a high dynamic range and high sensitivity.  Applications Orbitrap-based mass spectrometers are used in proteomics and are also used in life science mass spectrometry such as metabolism, metabolomics, environmental, food and safety analysis. Most of them are interfaced to liquid chromatography separations, though they are also used with gas chromatography and ambient ionization methods.

History It was designed by a team of architects under the leadership of Tadeusz Spychała. Its construction started in 2001 and ended in November 2003. It is the tallest hotel in Poland, the third-tallest in Europe, and one of the tallest 5-star hotels in the world. The building is characterised by its unusual shape and is finished in pea- green tones, like the adjacent Warsaw Financial Center. The building houses 414 rooms of various standards, including the presidential suite, 76 luxury suites with kitchenettes, and has 13 conference rooms. The building also has a ballroom, two bars, two restaurants, an E. Wedel chocolate fountain, sauna, fitness club, spa, and solarium. A modern swimming pool, located on the 43rd and 44th floors (150 meters above the ground) is the highest indoor swimming pool in Europe. Underground, spread over five levels, there is a car park for 175 vehicles. Construction of the building cost more than 100 million Euros. In order to build the skyscraper, the site was closed for almost a year and a legendary Polish jazz club, Akwarium, had to be demolished (it was relocated to the nearby Złote Tarasy shopping complex). The inhabitants of the surrounding blocks protested against the new building, claiming that it would obscure the sun. Ultimately, an agreement with the residents was reached - thanks to the building's \\"cut out\\" shape, nearby buildings' access to light is less restricted.

The character is loosely based on Archie Comics' character, The Fly. Fictional character biography Jason Troy was given an extra assignment by his mythology teacher, Mr. Abin (likely a nod to Abin Sur, the alien that bequeathed Green Lantern Hal Jordan his power ring) for playing video games in class, to make a hero based on the most humble of creatures. Jason designed a superhero patterned after a fly, and his teacher rewarded him for his efforts with a pendant made of a fly trapped in amber. Jason soon learned that the pendant was not just jewelry, it turned him into the superhero from his assignment. He became the Fly, and used his powers to foil an arson attempt by a super-villain named \\"Burnout\\". After he defeated the flame-throwing thug, he suddenly changed back into Jason. Obviously confused, he went to find his mythology teacher and question him about the pendant. When he returned to school to ask his teacher about the pendant, nobody in the school remembered ever seeing his teacher. Jason learned that the pendant could change him into his heroic alter-ego at will, so he continued his exploits as the Fly. He learned that using the Fly powers for a prolonged period of time physically exhausted him, and that he had cravings for anything high in sugar, like jelly doughnuts and pineapple juice. But he soon mastered his insect-like abilities (and urges). He also seemed to often lose track of time as the Fly, a fact that landed him in trouble at home several times. He fought flying thieves, mechanical spiders, and the occasional crime lord, and defeated them all. But he found himself in a sticky situation when his pendant was ripped off in a battle, but he did not lose his powers. He couldn't return home, since even when he took off his costume, he still looked like a muscular adult with fly-like eyes. He got a job as a bouncer in a bar (calling himself \\"Buzz\\") for a few days until he found his pendant. He joined the Crusaders, and when they got lost in another dimension, he spent years there with his teammates and fell in love with the Jaguar. When they finally returned, the Fly married the Jaguar. Powers and abilities The Fly has superhuman strength and insect-like wings that allow him to fly. The wings have also been shown to have a vibrational effect should he be restrained. He can stick to (and climb) any surface, such as walls, ceilings, etc. The Fly's costume acts as an exo-skeletal body armor, though it is not completely invulnerable. It is knife-proof, and offers some protection against bullets, and even small amounts of radiation. The large goggles in the mask allow him 270-degree vision, meaning he can see anything that happens except what is directly behind him. In his superhero form, he can remove the suit and mask, but his eyes appear to be compound eyes, similar to those of an insect (as seen in The Fly Annual #1) The amulet that is the source of his powers allow him to transform from a skinny teen to a muscular adult. Jason does this by touching the amulet and picturing himself as The Fly. The amulet is required in order for him to change back into Jason Troy. Whether or not the amulet would work for other people is unknown, but it does not seem likely as the message left for him by his mysterious benefactor, Mr. Abin, said they had been searching for someone like him for some time.

Inheriting the Giants, one of the flagship franchises of the National League, from his father, Charles, in , he oversaw four pennant-winning teams in his first two decades as owner. Then, in , he moved the Giants from New York City to San Francisco, one of two National League owners to bring Major League Baseball to the lucrative West Coast territory. Although the Giants won only one pennant () and one division title () in their first 15 years after moving to the Bay Area, they were a consistent contender that featured some of the era's biggest stars. But, during the mid-1970s, they declined in on-field success and suffered significant attendance losses, forcing Stoneham to sell the team in . Stoneham was born in Newark, New Jersey, and educated at the Hun School of Princeton and the Trinity-Pawling School. He briefly attended Fordham University, but soon dropped out to work in a copper mine in California and begin, at his father's insistence, his apprenticeship as a baseball executive and future owner.Obituary, The New York Times, 1990-01-09 He worked on the Giants' grounds crew and in their ticket office, then moved into their front office. When, at age 32, he succeeded to the team presidency on his father's death in January 1936, Stoneham became the youngest club owner in National League history. Hands-on owner His tenure witnessed three separate pennant- contending and -winning eras: the team that he inherited, the 1936–38 Giants of Bill Terry, Carl Hubbell and Mel Ott; the 1949–55 teams of manager Leo Durocher, including Monte Irvin, Sal Maglie, Bobby Thomson and Willie Mays; and the star-studded Giants of 1959–71. During Stoneham's 41 years as owner, the Giants won National League pennants in 1936, 1937, 1951, 1954 and 1962, a division title in 1971, and a World Series title in 1954. Stoneham employed at least two general managers during those four decades: Terry (1938–42), who doubled as the Giants' field manager through 1941, and Chub Feeney (1946–69), Stoneham's nephew, who became president of the National League (1970–86) after his December 1969 resignation. But Stoneham was known as a hands-on owner who was personally involved in player trades and transactions.Durocher, Leo, with Linn, Ed, Nice Guys Finish Last. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1975, pp. 235–239 With the post-World War II Giants falling into in the league's second division, Stoneham boldly moved to replace the popular Ott as his manager with the hyper-competitive, abrasive Durocher on July 16, 1948. Giant fans reviled Durocher as the pilot of the arch-rival Brooklyn Dodgers, but he quickly produced an exciting, hard-playing team that—within 2½ years, in 1951—won one of the most thrilling pennant races in history, capped by Thomson's come-from- behind, three-run walk-off home run in the final inning of the deciding game of the postseason playoff with the Dodgers. Durocher and Mays' 1954 Giants also took the NL flag, and won Stoneham's only World Series title with a four- game sweep over the Cleveland Indians. That season, Stoneham was hailed as The Sporting News' Executive of the Year in baseball. Controversial move to San Francisco As it turned out, the 1954 World Series title was the last hurrah for Stoneham and the Giants in New York. Stoneham was alarmed by a dramatic drop-off in attendance during the 1950s. The 1947 Giants had drawn 1.6 million paying fans despite finishing fourth. But the 1951 and 1954 pennant winners struggled to hit seven figures in home attendance, and mediocre 1956–57 Giants' teams had drawn fewer than 700,000 customers each season. It did not help matters that the Giants' park, the Polo Grounds, was not aging gracefully. The 46-year-old park, owned by Stoneham, had not been well maintained from the 1940s onward. Meanwhile, the area around the park (in Washington Heights in Upper Manhattan) was already going to seed.Thornley, Stew, \\"The Polo Grounds (New York)\\", Society for American Baseball Research All of these factors combined to hold down ticket sales. The thin gates hit Stoneham particularly hard since, unlike most of his fellow owners, the Giants and the Polo Grounds were his sole source of income. Stoneham's balance sheet took a further hit after the 1955 season when the football Giants, who had spent their entire history as tenants of the baseball Giants, moved across the Harlem River to Yankee Stadium. In hopes of finding a way out, Stoneham briefly considered moving to the Bronx as tenants of the Yankees—possibly before his lease at the Polo Grounds ran out in 1962. Ironically, the Yanks had been tenants of the Giants at the Polo Grounds from 1913 to 1922. However, impressed by the success of the Braves after their 1953 shift from Boston to Milwaukee, Stoneham decided to move his Giants to Minneapolis. He intended to set up shop in Metropolitan Stadium, which had just been constructed in nearby Bloomington for his Triple-A farm team, the Minneapolis Millers. The stadium had been built to Major-League specifications with the help of public funds, and Stoneham had declared there were at most two big-league parks that were better. Under baseball rules of the time, the Giants shared the MLB rights to the Twin Cities with the Dodgers, who operated the Millers' main rival, the St. Paul Saints, as one of their three Triple-A affiliates. Stoneham confided his plan to Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley, who then revealed that he was negotiating to transfer the Dodgers from Brooklyn to Los Angeles. He suggested that Stoneham contact San Francisco Mayor George Christopher and explore moving his team there to preserve the teams' bitter rivalry. Stoneham soon abandoned his Minnesota plan and shifted his attention, permanently, to San Francisco. In 1961, the Twin Cities succeeded in getting their own big-league team when the first incarnation of the Washington Senators moved there and became the Minnesota Twins. Stoneham and O'Malley were vilified by New York baseball fans when their teams' boards approved the moves to the West Coast.

With a rope around his neck!\\"Richman, Milt, Associated Press, in The Second Fireside Book of Baseball. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1958, page 292—and grief-stricken. During the August 19, 1957 press conference officially announcing the franchise's move to San Francisco, he explained, \\"Kids are still interested, but you don't see many of their parents at games.\\"Mozley, Dana. \\"Giants Gone; It's Frisco in '58,\\" Daily News (New York City), Tuesday, August 20, 1957. Retrieved February February 4, 2020 (In his book Five Seasons, Roger Angell quotes Stoneham as saying, \\"The last day we played [at the Polo Grounds], I couldn't go to the game. I just didn't want to see it all end.\\") Writer Roger Kahn said years later, during promotional tours for his book The Era 1947–57, that the deteriorating condition of the Polo Grounds, as well as the Giants' shrinking fan base, made it necessary for Stoneham to abandon New York. He noted, however, that the Dodgers—a year removed from the 1956 pennant and two from Brooklyn's first world championship—were still profitable and O'Malley's move West was motivated by a desire for even greater riches. The Giants' transfer to San Francisco was initially a rousing success. The team began to play winning baseball and drew 1.27 and 1.42 million fans playing in a tiny (22,900 capacity) minor league ballpark, Seals Stadium, in 1958–59. Then the Giants moved to brand-new Candlestick Park in 1960 and attendance rose above 1.75 million fans. (Meanwhile, the National League returned to New York in 1962, with an expansion team, the Mets.) Talented team produced one pennant While Stoneham's San Francisco club produced only one pennant (in ), one National League West Division title (), and no World Series triumphs, the Giants of the late 1950s and 1960s were one of the most talented assemblages in the National League. They included five Hall of Famers—Willie Mays, Willie McCovey, Juan Marichal, Orlando Cepeda and Gaylord Perry—and many other stars. The Giants were the first big league team to heavily scout and sign players from the Dominican Republic and brought the first Japanese player, pitcher Masanori Murakami, to the Majors in 1964. But the National League was so powerful and competitive—it had far outpaced the American League in signing African-American and Latin American players—the Giants had only one pennant to show for a decade-plus of contention. In , the team won 101 games and forced another best-of-three playoff with the Dodgers, then prevailed in the final inning of the decisive third game. In another echo of 1951, they were defeated by the Yankees in the World Series. Stoneham was partially to blame for the Giants' lack of sustained dominance, as he squandered the resources of his productive farm system through a series of poorly advised trades, usually for starting pitchers who could complement Marichal and Perry. He also hired as his manager from 1961–64 Alvin Dark, who had a brilliant baseball mind but a poor relationship with at least some of his minority players. Dark was fired after the 1964 Giants fell just short in a wild, end-of-season pennant race; almost as notably, his dismissal came after he had made well-publicized and derogatory remarks to the press about Latin ballplayers during the season. (Dark later said he was misquoted.)Seamheads.com Longtime Durocher aide Herman Franks, Dark's successor, then produced four consecutive second-place finishes through 1968. In , Mays' final full season with San Francisco, the Giants roared to an early lead in the NL West, winning 37 of their first 51 games to build a 10½-game margin over the Dodgers through May 31. Then they fell to earth, going only 53–58 for the rest of the season. Still, they prevailed by a single game over Los Angeles to become division champions. In the 1971 National League Championship Series, however, the eventual world champion Pittsburgh Pirates handled Stoneham's club in four games. In 1959, Stoneham began developing a spring training facility for the San Francisco Giants at Francisco Grande, in Casa Grande, Arizona. Francisco Grande hosted its first exhibition game in 1961, where Willie Mays hit a 375-foot home run in the fourth inning. Francisco Grande, now a hotel and golf resort, still houses various memorabilia of the San Francisco Giants of the 1960s. Struggles during the 1970s After their initial success, Stoneham's Giants fell on hard times after 1971. The arrival of the cross-bay Oakland Athletics in 1968 split the market. The Athletics themselves struggled at the turnstiles, leading to doubts about whether the Bay Area was big enough for two MLB teams. Attendance at cold and windy Candlestick Park plummeted after 1971 to levels even below those at the Polo Grounds in the mid-1950s; during Stoneham's final five years as owner, only in did the Giants draw more than 648,000 fans, causing Stoneham financial hardship. This was the same situation that forced him to move to San Francisco almost 20 years earlier. Finally, in 1976, he put the team up for sale. The Giants very nearly moved back east, to Toronto, when a deal with Canadian investors seemed imminent. In addition, it was briefly rumored that they might return to the metropolitan New York area, perhaps to a new baseball stadium in the New Jersey Meadowlands. Instead the franchise remained in San Francisco after he sold it to Bob Lurie and Phoenix, Arizona-based meat-packer Bud Herseth for $8 million, with the transaction unanimously approved by the other National League club owners on March 2, 1976.\\"Herseth Replaces Short As Co-Owner; Rigney Named Giants Manager,\\" United Press International, Wednesday, March 3, 1976. Retrieved February 29, 2020 Additionally, there was another unsuccessful attempt in 1992 to move the team to Tampa Bay. Both Toronto and Tampa eventually secured American League expansion teams.

He played for New South Wales in the very first rugby league match run by the newly created 'New South Wales Rugby Football League' which had just split away from the established New South Wales Rugby Football Union. During his 16-year English career he set a number of try-scoring records including the standing world first-grade record of 80 tries in a season in 1913–14. Australian career Born in Sydney, the son of a Jewish tailor, Rosenfeld was a foundation player for the Eastern Suburbs club in the Australian inaugural season 1908 and in 1909. He played on Easter Monday 1908 in the Easts team that beat Newtown 32–16 on the first day of rugby league premiership football in Australia. A , Rosenfeld represented his country in four Test matches. He made his Test début in Australia's first ever international series against New Zealand in 1908 where he appeared in all three matches. Later that season he was selected for Australia's inaugural Kangaroo Tour of 1908–09, making one Test appearance and playing in 13 minor representative matches. 1908 Kangaroos 1908 Kangaroos English career Whilst on tour Rosenfeld signed with English club Huddersfield after falling in love with Ethel (née Barrand) a local mill manager's daughter whom he later married. He was moved to the position by his new club and became a try scoring sensation. In the English season of 1911–12 he set a new try scoring record for one season with 78 tries only to better it the following but one season by scoring 80. To date neither mark has been beaten in England or Australia. The nearest anyone has come was 72 by, coincidentally another Australian and former Eastern Suburbs player, playing in England Brian Bevan in the 1952–53 season. In England he played for Huddersfield, Wakefield Trinity (Heritage № 277) and Bradford Northern and made the following Cup Final or international appearances: * , and scored a try in Huddersfield's 21-0 victory over Batley in the 1909–10 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1909–10 season at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds on 27 November 1909, * in the 2-8 defeat by Wakefield Trinity in the 1910–11 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1910–11 season at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds on 3 December 1910, * , and scored a try in the 22-10 victory over Hull Kingston Rovers in the 1911–12 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1911–12 season at Belle Vue, Wakefield on 25 November 1911, * , and scored a try in the 19-3 victory over Bradford Northern in the 1913–14 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1913–14 season at Thrum Hall, Halifax on 29 November 1913, * , and scored a try in the 31-0 victory over Hull F.C. in the 1914–15 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1914–15 season at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds on 28 November 1914 * , and scored a try in the 24-5 victory over Leeds in the 1919–20 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1919–20 season at Thrum Hall, Halifax on 29 November 1919. * , in Wakefield Trinity's 3-29 defeat by Australia in the 1921–22 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain match at Belle Vue, Wakefield on 22 October 1921.Hoole, Les (2004). Wakefield Trinity RLFC - FIFTY GREAT GAMES. Breedon Books. War service Rosenfeld's phenomenal try-scoring record is all the more extraordinary considering his career was interrupted by three years of active service. He enlisted in the British Army in 1916 and saw service in the Mesopotamian campaign. He was discharged in 1919. Later life Rosenfeld played rugby league until he was thirty-nine and then, still married to Ethel, he lived out his life in Huddersfield, He owned a tobacco shop and worked variously as a van driver and in a local dye house. Aged 85 years, Rosenfeld was the last of the inaugural Kangaroo Tourists to die. Accolades During his career (1908–24), Rosenfeld scored 391 tries. His try scoring feats earned him in 1988 a place in the British Rugby League Hall of Fame. In 2005, Rosenfeld was accepted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame with his official induction to take place at the 2009 Maccabiah games.

As Art Director at TSR in the early 1980s, he was also responsible for hiring many of the young artists who would go on to careers in the fantasy role-playing industry. Roslof created the cover for Keep on the Borderlands, of which more than one million copies were sold. Early life and career Jim Roslof was born November 21, 1946, in Chicago, Illinois to Edward E. and Gertrude (Kibitlewski) Roslof. Early in his career in the late 1960s, Jim Roslof was a contributor of cover art to the counterculture underground newspaper Chicago Seed. At TSR By 1979, Roslof had joined Erol Otus, Bill Willingham, Jeff Dee, Paul Reiche, and Evan Robinson as a staff artist at TSR, Inc. in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. Over the next year, he provided interior art for: *Lawrence Schick's White Plume Mountain (1979) *Gary Gygax's Slave Pits of the Undercity (1980) and Expedition to the Barrier Peaks (1980) *the hardcover rule book Deities & Demigods, in which he provided illustrations of the entire Greek pantheon (1980) *various issues of TSR's Dragon magazine, commencing with issue #42 (October 1980) Roslof also provided the cover art for some of AD&D;'s greatest adventures: *Queen of the Demonweb Pits (voted the single greatest adventure of all time, in compilation with the rest of the GDQ series, by Dungeon magazine in 2004) *The Ghost Tower of Inverness (ranked 30th greatest adventure in the same Dungeon article) *Secret of the Slavers Stockade *Keep on the Borderlands (ranked 7th greatest adventure in the same Dungeon article) B2 Keep on the Borderlands: Cover art by Jim Roslof The last of these is perhaps Jim's best known work, since the adventure was included in later printings of the Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set,Gygax, Gary (1979). The Keep on the Borderlands, TSR, Inc., of which over one million copies were sold. In May 1981, despite the large amount of artwork needed for an ever- increasing number of company products, TSR manager Kevin Blume fired two of the six staff artists, Paul Reiche and Evan Robinson, on what TSR editor Steve Winter described as \\"trumped-up charges of insubordination\\". When Bill Willingham and Jeff Dee complained, they were also fired, leaving only Roslof and Erol Otus as the art department. Roslof was promoted to Art Director, but instead of simply staying with the style of art that had defined TSR products since 1975, Roslof hired a cadre of brilliant artists whose artwork would define TSR to a generation, and who would all go on to successful careers as fantasy artists: Jim Holloway, Larry Elmore, Jeff Easley, Harry Quinn, Keith Parkinson, Tim Truman, and Clyde Caldwell. Parkinson recalled how he was hired: \\"I drove up one day to see if I could do some freelance work. Jim Roslof, who was the Art Director, hinted that I could join the staff full- time, but I missed the hint. A few days later, I called him about a job, and he had just hired somebody else the day before, but he’d keep me in mind. The next day, he called back, and had an opening.\\" The artists gathered in what TSR staffers called \\"the pit\\". As Scott Taylor recalled, the pit was \\"a place of creation for all the onsite artists of the growing company. Here countless worlds were born among rubber-band wars and constant deadline pressure. Still, the pit was a place of ultimate creation, a venue where artists worked together for inspiration, guidance, and commiseration in a time before the internet gave purchase to a web of greater connection.\\" In addition to giving direction to many disparate projects, Roslof also continued to provide artwork for TSR, including illustrations for In the Dungeons of the Slave Lords, Fiend Folio, Descent into the Depths of the Earth, Dwellers of the Forbidden City, and the Dungeoneer's Survival Guide. He also provided artwork for the first issue of Dungeon in 1986, as well as some of the illustrations for TSR's Monster Cards, including original depictions for monsters such as the wemic.Cayzle. \\"The Father of Modern Wemics: Correspondence with former TSR employees confirming the role of David C. Sutherland III in creating wemics for Dungeons & Dragons and Jim Roslof for being the first to depict these\\" (Cayzle's Wemic Site, 2005) In 1996, some of his art was used in the Blood Wars Card Game. After TSR After leaving TSR, Roslof moved to Elkhorn, Wisconsin, and continued to produce illustrations for the fantasy industry. In 2005, Goodman Games began to publish a series of D&D; adventures called \\"Dungeon Crawl Classics\\"; although they used an up-to-date version of rules, they were a deliberate throwback in content and style to TSR's \\"dungeon crawl\\" adventures of the 1970s and early 1980s. Several authors from TSR's heyday, including Monte Cook and Dave Arneson, were hired to write adventures, and artists such as Roslof, Jeff Dee, and Jim Holloway provided artwork. Roslof contributed cover art to two of the adventures, Dungeon Crawl Classics #29: The Adventure Begins (2006) and Dungeon Crawl Classics # 43: Curse of the Barrens (2007). In 2010, Roslof's last illustrations were created for Goodman Games' Dungeon Crawl Classic Role Playing Game rules manual. (The manual, which was published after Roslof's death, is dedicated to him.) As well as creating fantasy artwork, Roslof was also a professional graphic designer and inventor, with several patent applications for merchandising systems he worked on for DCI Marketing, Inc., the retail marketing subsidiary of IMI plc. Personal life Jim Roslof married Laura S. Miller on April 25, 1968, in Aptos, California; they had three children and four grandchildren at the time of his death. Laura Roslof was also involved in the creation of artwork for Dungeons & Dragons products, including the recalled version of Palace of the Silver Princess. At the time of her husband's death, she ran a stained glass art studio in Elkhorn, Wisconsin. Roslof died at his home in Elkhorn, Wisconsin, on Saturday March 19, 2011. Laura Roslof died on April 2, 2018.

These are often compared to modern Western scales, but they in fact represent much more information than a sequence of permissible pitches, since they include how those pitches should function in the music, and indicate basic formulas which serve as a basis for improvisation. In non-improvised music, such as codified liturgical music, it is still usually clear how the melody developed from set patterns.

It tells of Fabián Stratas, a magician and stand-up comedian from Buenos Aires, who saves his money from weddings, birthdays, and bar mitzvahs, and uses a hidden camera to document a week-long trip to the Falkland Islands, which he calls \\"Fuckland\\". He plans to impregnate an islander, reasoning that if only 500 Argentines did the same each year, the islands would soon be overrun with half-Argentines, and he would be the head of a \\"sexual invasion.\\" He sets his eyes on Camilla Heaney, whom he first saw in church.

The title roughly translates as \\"Church of Roses\\" or \\"Sanctuary of Roses\\". In February 2007, Bara no Seidou was re- released by German record label Trisol Music Group, packaged in both jewel case and limited slipcase versions, both including the Cardinal music video collection DVD. Influences Bara no Seidou is a major change from Malice Mizer's previous albums with less of a focus on the twin guitar sound that was present in their previous discography, but retaining a chameleon trait like artists such as Genesis and Roxy Music. The band's sound switched from a normal art rock sound into a dark, gothic metal one; however, they still continued to use the violins, harpsichords and other instruments present in their older works and also added in a pipe organ and a choir for a haunting, melancholic, and religious feel to the album. For example, the song \\"Seinaru Toki Eien no Inori\\" is based around an organ and choir but still includes dual guitars and drums, which gives it a gothic metal feel. Fan favorite \\"Kyomu no Naka de no Yuugi\\" is a track that uses an organ and harpsichord mixed with a synthesizer and drum machine for more of a dark wave element. This song is influenced by gothic rock/industrial music and features a different image in its video, but still retains the dark themes of the album.Review of Bara no Seidou at everything2.com After the death of Kami, it could be argued that the \\"funeral goth\\" element present in their attire is because of his death, and the song \\"Saikai no Chi to Bara\\" is a reference, and tribute, to him.The song \\"Saikai no Chi to Bara\\" is a longer version of the song \\"Saikai\\" from the EP Shinwa, dedicated to the deceased Kami. Live promotion The band released the DVD Bara ni Irodorareta Akui to Higeki no Makuake of their two-day live concert at the Nippon Budokan.

More Western women want their male partners to give active assistance during pregnancy and childbirth. History =United States= Father learns how to care for \\"practice baby\\" Until the concluding decades of the 19th century, an experienced nurse midwife, who was considered to be knowledgeable about the birth process, typically helped to deliver a woman's baby. Birth typically took place in the home, and it was considered to be an event for females. It was a time for female friends and relatives to come into the home and care for the mother, her household, provide reassurance, and offer guidance. Birth was not considered to be a private event, but more of a social one, that also could create a strong bond among the participants and supporting attendees. Physicians there warned that it was dangerous not to receive modern medical attention while delivering children. They also stated one in every thirty women was expected to die because of a lack of medical attention. Due to these warnings, many women favored going into labor with a physician as opposed to a midwife. Physicians typically prohibited friends and relatives from participating or observing. The birth process may have been regarded as private or even embarrassing to the patient or the doctor and there were issues of preventing infection. Around 1910, some states began to outlaw the midwifery practice. Others enacted regulatory requirements which were difficult for many midwives to complete. Since the 1920s, physician assistance has been predominant during childbirth. However, since the 1960s midwifery has returned and grown in popularity and societal acceptance. Even during childbirth with a physician, it is now common for women to have their families, particularly their partners, in the delivery room with them. To help their wives prepare for childbirth, many male partners participate in specialized childbirth classes, such as Lamaze or Bradley method of natural childbirth. Men may give active assistance during childbirth by simply being present during his wife's labor or by coaching during childbirth. Many women find their partners' presence in the delivery room to be comforting. If he is present the man may be able to assist in making decisions that may be required at various junctures in the childbirth process (for example, regarding the use of epidural, accelerating delivery, dealing with medical problems and other matters). =Australia= Until the early 1960s men were typically excluded from the labour room. However, during this decade there was an increasing pressure on hospitals to allow men into the labour room to provide support for their partners. It was only by the 1980s that it became common and expected that men would be present when their partners gave birth. The contemporary Australian experience is that men are expected to be present and support their partners.Vernon, David (2006) Men at Birth, Australian College of Midwives, Canberra, Factors affecting husband's aid during pregnancy and delivery Military father in the \\"empathy belly\\" during a Baby Boot Camp workshop on the basics of newborn care. Many women find it soothing to have someone assist them during their pregnancies, making it more common for a woman's male partner to support her both before and during childbirth. The type and quality of a relationship between a man and a woman is what determines how, and if, the man will be active during his partner's pregnancy. =Fear and anxiety= Some contend that when men are fearful or anxious regarding birth that they actually make the birth more difficult for their partner. Their fear may be transmitted to their partner and this increases her adrenaline levels leading to labor stalling. In some circumstances this may require the use of medications such as oxytocin to restart labor and thus can sometimes lead to a cascade of intervention that can result in a caesarean section. Examples of participation Two musicians have played or performed musical works during the delivery of a child of theirs. Mickey Hart recorded Music to be Born By and played it back during delivery, and Alfredo Rolando Ortiz played Paraguayan harp at the birth of his child. References Bibliography Bradley, Robert A.

Education and career Greene was born Heinz Grünhaus in Frankfurt, Germany. When he was 20 years old, his family, who were Jewish, fled the Nazi regime to Belgium, Vichy France, Portugal, and finally the United States in 1943, during World War II. Greene enlisted in the United States Army and interrogated German prisoners for military intelligence. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1949 from George Washington University and Juris Doctor in 1952 from George Washington University Law School. From 1952 to 1953, Greene was a law clerk for Judge Bennett Champ Clark of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Next, Greene was an Assistant United States Attorney for the District of Columbia until 1957 and chief of appeals research for the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division from 1957 to 1965. At the Justice Department, Greene helped create the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965. Greene was a judge of the Court of General Sessions in Washington, D.C. from 1956 to 1966 and Chief Judge of that court until 1971, and Chief Judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia from 1971 to 1978.

The consent decree, later amended and usually called the modified final judgment (MFJ), provided for the Bell System divestiture, AT&T;'s spin off of the seven Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs). The conclusion of the case freed AT&T; to enter the computer industry, from which it had previously been barred. Greene presided over the 1990 trial of Admiral Poindexter. This was the first time that any former president (Reagan) testified about his own conduct in office in connection with a criminal trial. In 1990, Greene sentenced the 1983 United States Senate bombing suspects, Laura Whitehorn and Linda Evans, to prison. Death Greene died from a cerebral hemorrhage on January 29, 2000 and was undergoing brain operations at the time. He had a wife, Evelyn, and two children: son Dr. Michael D. Greene and daughter Stephanie Cavagrotti. After his death, the George Washington University Law School created the Harold H. Greene Professor of Law endowed chair in his memory.

In the introduction, Dahl laments that adults are always telling children what to do and what not to do, and says he would not have agreed to write the booklet, which tells children what to do, if not for the importance of what he is about to discuss.

He commanded the successful defense of his sector of the Union line against Pickett's Charge during the Battle of Gettysburg. Early life Hall was born in New York,Cullum, p. 488. the son of Joseph Hall and Edify Wolcott Hall and the brother Corydon Phelps Hall and Alanson Scofield Hall. His family moved to Raisinville in Monroe County, Michigan. On March 19, 1854, Hall was appointed to the United States Military Academy by Jefferson Davis, Secretary of War (and the future President of the Confederate States of America). He graduated in July 1859, ranking 13th in a class of 22. Hall was appointed a brevet second lieutenant in the 4th U.S. Artillery. He became a ranking second lieutenant in the 1st U.S. Artillery on January 10, 1860. Civil War Hall was serving in South Carolina at Fort Sumter when the Civil War erupted. He was an emissary for the fort early in the standoff, communicating directly with Confederate officials. During the prolonged artillery bombardment, the United States flag was knocked to the ground by a Confederate shell burst. Hall raced through flames across the parade ground (permanently burning off his eyebrows) to save the flag, and, with the help of two fellow artillerists, replaced the pole and again hoisted \\"Old Glory\\" over the battered fort. When Major Robert Anderson evacuated the fort, Hall returned home to Monroe Michigan, where he was instrumental in recruiting volunteers for the Army. Hall was promoted to first lieutenant in the 5th U.S. Artillery on May 14, 1861. During the Peninsula Campaign, he commanded the artillery of Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker's division. He briefly served on the staff of the Army of the Potomac's chief engineer. He left in July 1862 to accept a commission as colonel of the 7th Michigan Infantry, leading it during the Second Battle of Bull Run and the Maryland Campaign. At the Battle of Antietam in September, his regiment suffered 60% casualties, losing 20 of 23 field officers killed or wounded. He assumed command of the 3rd Brigade, Sedgwick's Division after Napoleon J. T. Dana was wounded in the failed assault on the West Woods. Hall was wounded shortly thereafter, and his horse was killed. Hall was cited for gallantry at Antietam, and again for his actions at Fredericksburg. Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside, commander of the Army of the Potomac, asked for volunteers for the dangerous task of leading troops across pontoon bridges to seize the town. The 25-year-old Hall stepped forward and volunteered to lead his men across in the face of withering enemy fire. However, sharpshooters prevented the completion of the bridge, and when presented with the new situation, Lt. Col. Henry Baxter of the 7th Michigan Volunteer Infantry agreed to lead the regiment across in boats under heavy fire. The exploit was successful, allowing the sharpshooters to be cleared from the opposite river bank long enough for the bridge to be completed and the rest of the brigade to cross and enter the battle. One admiring soldier later wrote, \\"It was a display of heroism, which moves men as nothing else can.\\" =Gettysburg= At Gettysburg, Hall's brigade was formed in battle line along Cemetery Ridge, just south of the famed \\"Copse of Trees\\". It formed the left of Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock's II Corps. The brigade was attacked by Brig. Gen. Ambrose R. Wright's Confederates, who overran a battery in front of Hall's position before being repulsed. Hall lost over 200 men in his brigade in the fierce fighting. On July 3, three full Confederate divisions attacked the ridge in what became popularly known as \\"Pickett's Charge,\\" named for Maj. Gen. George Pickett. Hall's Brigade was rushed in as reinforcements to close a critical breach in the Union line and thus, contributed greatly to the victory. In recognition for his service at Gettysburg, Hall received his third citation for gallantry, and was promoted to the rank of captain in the regular army on August 1, 1863. Death The youthful Hall seemed destined for more honors and promotion. However, the rigors of the Gettysburg Campaign and subsequent movements had deteriorated his health. A variety of illnesses forced him to go on sick leave and he never again served in the field. He was mustered out of the volunteer service in May 1864. In February 1865, the ailing Hall retired from the regular army with the rank of brevet lieutenant colonel. Two years later, he was dead. He was buried in Section 30, Row I, Grave 373 of the Post Cemetery at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Notes References * Cullum, Bvt. Maj. Gen. George W.

It is one of the largest college newspapers in the United States, with a daily circulation of roughly 12,000 during the fall and spring semesters, and it is among the oldest student newspapers in the South. The Texan is entirely student-run and independent from the university, although its operations are overseen by Texas Student Media, an entity with faculty, student, and newspaper industry representatives. The paper has won more national, regional and state awards than any other college newspaper in America and counts 25 Pulitzer Prize winners among its former staffers. History The Texan's origins date back to October 1900, with the merger of two privately owned weekly newspapers, The Ranger (est. 1897) (which had succeeded The Alcalde, which published from 1895–1897) and The Ranger and the Calendar (1889–1900). In 1902 The Texan was taken over by the Student Association.\\"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN,\\" Texas State Historical Association. Accessed Dec. 18, 2016. From 1900-1907, the newspaper came out weekly; and from 1907-1913 The Texan was published semiweekly. In 1913, the student body voted to publish the paper each weekday, and The Daily Texan was born on September 24, 1913. In 2008, The Daily Texan was one of three student newspapers that owned and operated its own printing press. Originally acquired in 1973 for US$222,000 (US$1,080,606 adjusted), the press was put on the market in 2009. In May 2009, the Austin American-Statesman began printing The Daily Texan. As of October 2019, New Braunfels Herald-Zeitung prints and distributes the papers. Staff Historically, writers for the Daily Texan have been paid much less than the minimum wage. Most Journalism students - who are in the same complex - can't contribute to the Texan due to their course workload and the poor pay offered by the Texan. Historically, the position of editor of The Daily Texan has been elected. The logic of an elected editor historically has been based on the newspaper's having been founded and owned by students and then given over to the student body. More recently, it has been argued that because students were compelled to fund the paper through the payment of mandatory student service fees, they should have some say in the paper's overall direction. In addition, the elected editor has been seen as a way to protect the paper from institutional censorship from the university. Since the student body selects the editor of the paper, this ensures that the university administration cannot install an editor sympathetic to its views and thereby control the content of the newspaper. In modern times, editorial candidates have been screened by the Texas Student Publications Board (now known as Texas Student Media), an entity with faculty, student, and newspaper industry representatives. The TSM Board publishes a handbook which sets forth the requirements an editorial candidate must meet before his or her name may be placed on the ballot. The board has been resistant to the idea of an elected editor and has made several attempts to convert the position to an appointed one. The most recent attempt, led by the board president, was in 2005. The TSM Board currently appoints the managing editor, who oversees the daily operation of the paper while the elected editor generally stewards the editorial page. However, the elected editor retains the final say over the content of the newspaper. Awards The Texan has won many prestigious awards, including the Associated Collegiate Press' \\"Pacemaker Award\\" in 1965, 1969, 1971 and 1985, and the Columbia Scholastic Press' Gold Crown Award in 1984, 1985, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1997, 2005 and 2006. Most recently the Texan won TAPME's Newspaper of the Year Award for 2015. Notable staff alumni A number of comic artists who began at the Texan have gone on to attain commercial success. The most notable of these are Chris Ware, creator of Jimmy Corrigan, the Smartest Kid on Earth; Berkeley Breathed, creator of Academia Waltz, the predecessor to Bloom County; and Robert Rodriguez, director of Sin City. Hepcats by Martin Wagner and Eyebeam by Sam Hurt also found continued success after their creators left the University of Texas at Austin.

The station is owned by Hubbard Broadcasting and airs a country music radio format. Hubbard also owns four other radio stations in the Seattle metropolitan area. The studios and offices are located at Newport Corporate Center on 131st Avenue SE in Bellevue. KNUC's effective radiated power (ERP) is 63,900 watts (68,000 with beam tilt). The transmitter is located in Issaquah on Tiger Mountain. KNUC broadcasts in the HD Radio format. Its HD-2 subchannel carries co-owned talk station KKNW 1150 AM. History =KMCS and KBBX = In May 1958, the station first signed on as KMCS, owned by Market- Casters, Inc. (hence the call sign). It was then locally owned by former executives with Crown Broadcasting (later to be known as the King Broadcasting Company). KMCS played popular music and was powered at 10,500 watts, a fraction of its current output. From the late 1960s into the late 1980s, the station operated a sub-carrier 67 kHz subsidiary communications authority (SCA), which transmitted music and point of sale commercials to subscribing restaurants and stores in the Puget Sound area, not available on regular FM receivers. The station switched its call letters to KBBX in 1966. =KEZX= KBBX began airing the syndicated easy listening \\"Music Only For A Woman\\" format in 1972, supplied by TM. The station also increased its power to 35,000 watts, covering Seattle, Tacoma and adjoining communities. The call letters changed to KEZX. The station's slogan was \\"Oceans of Beautiful Music.\\" The SCA was part of the reason that Roy H. Park, owner of Park Broadcasting, purchased the station in late 1975. At the time, Park was one of the largest broadcast companies in the U.S., with many of its stations also airing beautiful music, including WPAT-AM-FM in the New York metropolitan area. KEZX increased its power in the spring of 1977 to 100,000 watts. Under Park, the station used the Bellevue-based BPI syndicated service, then, beginning in the Spring of 1976, the \\"FM 100 Plan\\" from WLOO in Chicago; locally originated programming would return in 1980. By the early 1980s, the easy listening format was beginning to age. In 1983, KEZX flipped to a mix of soft adult contemporary, \\"West Coast\\" singer-songwriter music, album oriented rock, and jazz music, a forerunner to today's adult album alternative (AAA) format. KEZX remained as a AAA station until October 15, 1990, when it reverted to Soft AC. =Smooth Jazz KWJZ= In August 1993, KEZX became a smooth jazz outlet, a format that was gaining ground in many major US cities. In October 1995, the station's call sign became KWJZ to complement its smooth jazz format, which had achieved positive ratings in the Seattle-Tacoma radio market. In 1996, KWJZ and co-owned AM 1150 (now KKNW) were sold to Sandusky Broadcasting for $26 million. With the celebration of the 15th anniversary of KWJZ's format in 2008, the station dropped the \\"Smooth Jazz\\" part of its branding and became known simply as 98.9 KWJZ. While smooth jazz still made up the majority of its programming, KWJZ incorporated some chill out music, such as that featured on the syndicated program Chill with Mindi Abair (which aired on Sunday nights on KWJZ), as part of a more broadly defined \\"smooth music\\" format. In the 2000s, KWJZ and other Smooth Jazz stations began a slow decline in ratings due to changes in Arbitron's measurement system. Portable People Meters (PPM) started being introduced in the Seattle market in late 2008. =Click 98.9= Logo for Click 98.9, 2010-2014 On December 27, 2010, at 3 p.m., KWJZ changed its format to adult album alternative/modern AC as \\"Click 98.9.\\" Click's first song was Animal by Neon Trees. On March 15, 2011, KWJZ changed its call letters to KLCK-FM to reflect its brand name. Following Mediabase's addition of the station on the alternative rock panel, the station switched to alternative rock in November 2011, though it still leaned toward AAA. Unlike other alternative stations, Click also aired some dance music, such as Martin Solveig's \\"Hello\\" and Maroon 5's \\"Moves Like Jagger.\\" By that December, the station began to include some hot AC material, such as Kelly Clarkson and Daughtry (primarily artists from sister adult contemporary radio station KRWM), but still retained its modern rock direction, reporting to Mediabase's alternative rock panel. By March 2012, the station switched to hot adult contemporary per Mediabase reports, joining adult top 40 station KPLZ-FM, though KLCK-FM would shift back towards modern AC by mid-2014. In July 2013, Sandusky announced it would sell its radio holdings in Seattle and Phoenix to Hubbard Broadcasting. The sale was completed that November. During the latter part of the \\"Click\\" years, ratings for the station were continually ranked low, averaging about a high 1 to a low 2 share of the Seattle market, as the station was unable to compete against KPLZ, KNDD, KBKS and KYNW. (In the January 2015 Nielsen PPM ratings report for the market, KLCK was ranked #19 with a 1.9 share). In addition, the station consistently tweaked its music direction and had a frequent airstaff turnover. =Rock 98.9= On March 11, 2016, at Noon, after playing Grapevine Fires by Bellingham band Death Cab for Cutie, KLCK began stunting with a \\"Wheel of Formats,\\" changing playlists every 6 hours at 6 am, Noon, 6 pm, and Midnight. The formats consisted of all-Frank Sinatra, all-Eagles, all-Garth Brooks, opera/showtunes/musical soundtracks, all-Billy Joel, all-Elvis, all-Red Hot Chili Peppers/Foo Fighters, TV show theme songs, all-Neil Diamond, all-Madonna, all-AC/DC, all-Elton John, all- Beatles, prank phone calls from sister KQMV's morning show \\"Brooke and Jubal\\", and all-Led Zeppelin. There were rumors that the station was planning a format change to all sports as \\"98.9 The Score\\" or \\"Sports 98.9.\\" (A Facebook page was even made for the latter branding, as well as one for \\"98.9 Real Conservative Radio\\" to throw speculators off the trail, with the pages taken down shortly after.) The station's website was replaced with quotes from historical figures and lyrics from songs such as The Beatles’ \\"In My Life,\\" Elvis Presley’s \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" and Garth Brooks’ \\"Unanswered Prayers,\\" as well as floating question mark bubbles which, when clicked on, either played a female computerized voice soundbite stating \\"Hey, don't touch that,\\" \\"What is going on?\\" \\"This is strange,\\" or \\"That tickles.\\" In addition, Hubbard requested the call sign KVRQ for the station, which was approved on March 15. Program Director Lisa Adams, morning host Jerry Potter, and midday host Megan Lee all exited with the change. At Noon on March 16, 2016, the station officially flipped to mainstream rock as \\"Rock 98.9\\", with the first song being Nirvana's \\"In Bloom,\\" part of a 12,000-song, 30-day commercial-free introductory run. The station also made the official change to the KVRQ call letters on the same day. =Country 98.9/98.9 The Bull= Logo as \\"Country 98.9\\" On December 4, 2017, at 10:44 a.m., while in the middle of playing \\"Otherside\\" by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, KVRQ flipped to country music as Country 98.9; the change came after long-time country station KMPS flipped to soft adult contemporary earlier in the morning (after having briefly switched to all-Christmas music upon the completion of CBS Radio's merger with Entercom, the owner of competing country station KKWF). The call letters were changed to KNUC on February 6, 2018. On April 3, 2018, the station rebranded as 98.9 The Bull.

Biography Bergmann studied philosophy and German philology at the University of Leipzig and got his PhD in 1905. Subsequently, he continued his studies in Berlin. Later he returned to Leipzig, where he received the status of Privatdozent at the university in 1911. In 1916 he was awarded the position of Ausserordentlicher Professor (professor without chair). He developed a religious philosophy with mystical aspects. Later he embraced the ideas of the National Socialist German Workers Party and became one of its prominent academic propagators. He officially joined the Nazi Party in 1930.Yvonne Sherratt, Hitler's Philosophers, Yale University Press, 2013, p. 282  Works and Ideology  His works Die deutsche Nationalkirche (the German National Church) and Die natürliche Geistlehre (The Natural Doctrine of the Spirit) were placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum, the Roman Catholic list of banned books, in 1934 and 1937. In his theology work Die 25 Thesen der Deutschreligion (Twenty-five Points of the German Religion), he held that the Old Testament and portions of the New Testament of the Bible were unsuitable for use in Germany. He claimed that Jesus was of Aryan descent and that he was not a Jew. Bergmann described Adolf Hitler as the new messiah. Other key elements of the doctrine formed by Bergmann within his works, included the following: * Jewish Old Testament elements of Christianity were to be abandoned, due to the fact that they endorsed the life and times of the Jewish people's, and proclaimed their superiority over other human beings [Deuteronomy 7:1-9] * The Swastika, was cited to be the new symbol of the German Christian Movement; to replace the Cross * the Nazi concepts of Land, Blood and German Culture, were the 'sacred assets' of German belief  Death  In 1945, he committed suicide after the Allied forces captured Leipzig.

Founded in 1988, it employs approximately 25 full-time staff members and over 100 part-time undergraduate and graduate students, and counts over 150 companies as members. History The UNH-IOL began as a project of the University's Research Computing Center (RCC). In 1988 the RCC was testing Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) equipment with the intention of deploying it in its network. The RCC found that equipment from two vendors did not work together and contacted the vendors to find a solution. The two vendors cooperated with the RCC to solve the problem which was caused by differences between the draft and final FDDI specification. During this same time period the RCC was testing 10BASE-T Ethernet interfaces for another project. The University recognized the need for interoperability testing of networking equipment and also the opportunity to provide students with hands-on experience in emerging technologies. With the idea of providing testing services to companies in a vendor-neutral environment the first UNH-IOL consortium (10BASE-T Ethernet) was founded in 1990. Over the next decade the UNH-IOL grew to twelve consortia with over 100 member companies. In 2002, having outgrown several smaller locations, the UNH- IOL moved to a 32,000 square foot facility on the outskirts of the UNH campus. One area in which the UNH-IOL has been influential is IPv6 standardization and deployment. Between 2003 and 2007 the UNH-IOL organized the Moonv6 project, which was a multi-site, IPv6 based network designed to test the interoperability of IPv6 implementations. At the time the Moonv6 project was the largest permanently deployed multi-vendor IPv6 network in the world. The UNH-IOL is also the only North American laboratory offering ISO/IEC 17025 accredited testing designed specifically for the USGv6 Test Program. The UNH- IOL is also known for organizing and hosting plugfests for a number of industry trade organizations. The lab has hosted plugests for the Broadband Forum, NVM Express, SCSI Trade Association, Ethernet Alliance, and the Open Compute Project, among others. In 2013 the UNH-IOL was awarded the IEEE-SA Corporate Award \\"for outstanding corporate leadership and contribution to IEEE-SA\\". In January 2016 the lab moved to a new 28,000 square foot location adjacent to the main UNH campus in Durham, NH. Consortia The UNH-IOL operates testing programs on an annual membership basis called consortia. Each consortium is a collaboration between equipment vendors, test equipment manufacturers, industry forums, and the UNH-IOL in a particular technology. The collaborative testing model is intended to distribute the costs associated with maintaining a high-quality testing program among the consortium members. The UNH-IOL currently administers consortia in over 20 different technologies, including: * Internetworking Protocols ** IPv6, Routing and SDN, RTC and VoIP, DLNA, RVU, TR-069 * Data Center ** Open Compute Project testing, iSCSI, Fibre Channel, NVMe, Data center bridging, OpenFabrics Alliance * Embedded Systems ** AVnu, Precision Time Protocol, BroadR-Reach (Automotive Ethernet) * Broadband Systems ** DSL, G.fast, Power over Ethernet, Wireless LAN, Open Platform for NFV * Baseband Systems ** MIPI, Serial ATA, Serial attached SCSI, PCI Express, 40/100 Gigabit Ethernet, 10 Gigabit Ethernet, Backplane Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, Fast Ethernet References University of New Hampshire Interoperability ","title":"University of New Hampshire InterOperability Laboratory"},{"id":"5023273","text":"Nåvatnet is a lake in the municipality of Åseral in Agder county, Norway.

Under the amendments effective in 1901, to the charter of the then-recently-amalgamated City of Greater New York, the Board of Estimate and Apportionment was composed of eight ex officio members: the Mayor of New York City, the New York City Comptroller and the President of the New York City Board of Aldermen, each of whom had three votes; the borough presidents of Manhattan and Brooklyn, each having two votes; and the borough presidents of the Bronx, Queens, and Richmond (Staten Island), each having one vote. (The 1897 charter effective on amalgamation had had a five-member Board of Estimate and Apportionment.) The La Guardia Reform Charter of 1938 simplified its name and enhanced its powers. In 1957, the Charter was amended to raise the number of votes on the Board to twenty-two. Twelve of these votes were held by the three citywide officials, and the five borough presidents were allotted two votes each. On March 22, 1989, the Supreme Court of the United States unanimously declared in Board of Estimate of City of New York v. Morris that the Board of Estimate was unconstitutional on the grounds that Brooklyn, the city's most populous borough, had no greater effective representation on the board than Staten Island, the city's least populous borough, and that this arrangement was a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause pursuant to the high court's 1964 \\"one man, one vote\\" decision (Reynolds v.

He was tried, convicted, and executed by the electric chair in Louisiana for the murder of Louisiana State Police Trooper Donald Cleveland. The case received international attention because the defendant was a black man convicted by an all-white jury; had brain damage and tested just above mental retardation; and was age 17 at the time of the crime. Prejean's son, Dalton Prejean Jr., born while his dad was awaiting execution was himself convicted of the 2001 death of a 14-month old baby. Prejean Jr. is currently serving a 60-year sentence in the same prison his father was executed in. Background Prejean was the second of four children. When he was two weeks old his parents sent him from their home in Lafayette to live with his aunt and uncle in Houston, Texas. Dalton was unaware of his true parentage until the age of eleven. When Dalton's father left his mother and moved to Houston, the aunt decided that Dalton had to be told that he was not her child. Around this time, he began creating problems of an unknown nature, and was sent to live with his mother in Lafayette. Dalton began skipping his school classes following his return to Lafayette. In March 1972, he was committed to the Louisiana Training Institute for truancy at the insistence of his mother. Released only seven months later, he soon came into conflict with the authorities on charges of burglary, theft, and \\"false firearms\\". In March 1974, he was committed to the Lafayette Juvenile Youth Authority, a residential program for delinquents. He ran away from that facility after a month; upon his return his commitment was terminated and he was released on probation to his mother. In June 1974, Dalton was arrested for the killing of John Doucet, a taxi driver. Dalton admitted the killing and was committed once again to the Louisiana Training Institute. In a later statement about the incident Dalton stated that he and two friends called a cab with the intention of robbing the driver. One of his companions was carrying a gun. The three directed the driver to a quiet part of town and persuaded him to stop while they searched for an address. Dalton insisted on taking the gun from his companion because the other youth appeared to be nervous. Dalton approached the driver, and believing that the driver was reaching for a gun of his own, fired twice and began running. While fleeing he told a passerby to call an ambulance because someone had been shot. Dalton later turned himself in to the police and admitted that he had killed the driver. A psychiatric evaluation of Dalton was performed in 1974. He was found to be intellectually limited and to have very poor judgment. Dalton was diagnosed as having borderline mental retardation, and it was questionable if he knew the difference between right and wrong. The psychiatrist considered the boy to be \\"a definite danger to himself and others, and his dream content suggests that it is a matter of accident that the cab driver was killed rather than the boy being killed. He is equally likely to get himself killed in the near future.\\" The psychiatrist therefore recommended a lengthy confinement, followed by transfer to permanent facilities. The juvenile courts had jurisdiction over the defendant until he was twenty-one. The doctor's recommendation would have served to keep the defendant confined until December 1980. In 1976, however, another doctor conducted a psychiatric evaluation of the defendant and recommended that he be discharged. He concluded that the defendant's values had changed, but cautioned that \\"suitable conditions (should be) imposed to be sure he had adequate supervision and is going to live in a fairly stable environment\\". That doctor also suggested that fairly rigid probation requirements be imposed. On December 10, 1976, Prejean was released to the custody of his aunt in Houston, apparently without any probation requirements. Within seven months, Dalton was once more under arrest for murder.  Crime  At about five o'clock in the morning of July 2, 1977, Prejean, his brother Joseph, Michael George, and Michael Broussard left Roger's Nite Club in Lafayette Parish. The four had spent the night drinking in various lounges in the vicinity. They left Roger's Nite Club in a 1966 Chevrolet driven by Dalton, with his brother in the front seat and the other two in the back. The car's taillights were not working, and within a few hundred feet of the lounge, Trooper Cleveland, who was on his way to work driving his police vehicle, signaled the Chevrolet to stop. Prejean and his brother attempted to switch places in the front seat because the defendant had been driving without a license. The trooper noticed the switch and ordered the occupants out of the car. He told Michael George and Michael Broussard to get back in and began to search Joseph Prejean. Dalton Prejean, back in the car, stated in reaction to the trooper's pushing Joseph against the car, over Joseph's protest, \\"I don't like the way he's doing my brother.\\" Dalton then took a .38 caliber revolver from under the car seat, got out of the car and approached the officer with the gun hidden against his leg. As he neared the trooper he fired without warning. Trooper Cleveland was struck by two bullets and was killed. Dalton and his companions fled the scene but were apprehended several hours later. Dalton was once again given psychological tests during pretrial confinement. On the basis of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale, the Stanford Binet Vocabulary Subtest and the Bender-Gestalt Test, Dr. William Hawkins determined that he functioned at the dull normal level in the verbal area but in the borderline mental retardation area in the performance area. He had a verbal IQ of 82 and a performance IQ of 72. His full scale IQ is 76, with a full scale mental age of thirteen years and six months.  Trial and appeals Dalton Prejean was charged by grand jury indictment with first degree murder in violation of Louisiana Revised Statute 14:30. The trial was transferred from Lafayette Parish to Ouachita Parish because of pretrial publicity. After a three-day bifurcated trial beginning on May 1, 1978, a jury of twelve persons found the defendant guilty as charged and unanimously recommended that the death penalty be imposed. Prejean's defense lawyers appealed citing mitigating factors of an IQ around 71, schizophrenia with two institutionalizations, and his abandonment as an infant. The death penalty appeal reached the US Supreme Court in 1990; in November 1989 it had granted a stay on the eve of his scheduled execution. On April 17, 1990, the Court lifted the stay without comment. The European Parliament called for commutation of the sentence and a review of the evidence. A representative for Amnesty International said, \\"I doubt that in documented recent world history there is an execution [with] such a pile of reasons not to do it.\\". Louisiana Governor Buddy Roemer declined to commute the death sentence to life in prison, rejecting the recommendation of the parole board. \\"On behalf of 780 state troopers, and thousands of police officers who put their lives on the line every day, the execution will proceed.\\"  Execution  Louisiana State Penitentiary, where Prejean died On May 18, 1990, Prejean was executed in the electric chair at Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola. His final statement was: > Nothing is going to be accomplished. I have peace with myself. I'd like to > thank all of those who supported me all these years. I'd also like to thank > my loved ones for being strong. . . . My son will be a better person for not > letting something like this bring down his life. . . . Keep strong, keep > pushing, keep praying. They said it wasn't for the revenge, but it's hard > for me to see, to understand. I hope they're happy. So I forfeit my life. I > give my love to all.
