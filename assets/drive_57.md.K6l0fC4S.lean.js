Nikolayevsky gorodok, Saratov Governorate ‚Äì 14 September 1973, Moscow, USSR) was a Russian and Soviet poet, writer, translator and journalist. A prominent figure in the Acmeist movement of the Russian poetry, he is also regarded as one of the founders of the Soviet school of poetry translation. Biography Mikhail Zenkevich was born in the rural area of Saratov region. His father Alexander Osipovich Zenkevich taught mathematics at the Marinsky Agricultural Community College, mother Evdokiya Semyonovna (n√©e Neshcheretova) was a gymnasium teacher. In 1904, after graduating the First Saratov Gymnasium, Mikhail Zenkevich travelled abroad and spent two years in Germany, studying in the Universities of Jena and Berlin. In 1906 he published his first three poems in the Saratov-based Zhizn y shkola (Life and School) magazine. In 1907 Zenkevich moved to Saint Petersburg and started writing for magazines Vesna, Sovremenny mir, Obrazovanye and Zavety. In 1910 he met Nikolai Gumilev who helped him to publish some of his poetry in the Apollon magazine (No. 9, 1910). In 1911 Zenkevich joined the newly formed First Workshop of Poets and became part of the Acmeist circle, striking close friendship with Vladimir Narbut. Around this time he enrolled into the Saint Petersburg University's law faculty which he graduated from in 1915. Before that, in 1912, Zenkevich's debut book of poetry The Wild Porphyry (–î–∏–∫–∞—è –ø–æ—Ä—Ñ–∏—Ä–∞) in which the author explored the possibilities of 'expressing science through poetry', came out. It had strong resonance, with poets like Nikolai Gumilyov, Valery Bryusov, Vyacheslav Ivanov, Sergey Gorodetsky and Boris Sadovskoy giving it positive reviews. In December 1917 Zenkevich returned to his native Saratov to join the stuff of the local Saratovskye Izvestia newspaper. In 1918 his second collection The Fourteen Poems came out. A year later Zenkevich joined the Red Army as a volunteer and served there for three years first as a secretary for court martial, then the tribunal official at the Caucasian Front HQ where he also lectured on infantry weaponry. He continued to write and in 1921 published Tanks' Harvest (–ü–∞—à–Ω—è —Ç–∞–Ω–∫–æ–≤). Two more collections, Lyrics and Porphybagr (the latter combining the Wild Porphyry material with the poems from the new collection called Under the Meat Porphyry) were prepared for publication but never issued. In the twenties he wrote The Muzhik Sphinx (1921‚Äì1928) book of memoirs, published only in 1978. Up until 1923 Zenkevich lived in Saratov where he worked for ROSTA and gave lectures (on Alexander Blok, Velemir Khlebnikov and others). In 1923 he moved to Moscow and joined first the Rabotnik Prosveschenya magazine (as a secretary) than Goslitizdat as a foreign literature editor. In 1923 his first translation (from Victor Hugo) was published. Several books of poetry (Under the Steamer's Nose, 1926 and The Late Flight, 1928 among them) followed. The Wright brothers biography written by Zenkevich came out in 1934 in the Lives of Distinguished People series. In 1934‚Äì1936 he worked in Novy Mir as a poetry department editor. In 1936 Zenkevich co-founded the Poets of America anthology and since then concentrated on translating the classic and contemporary American poets. This resulted in a series of anthologies: From the American Poetry (1846), Poets of the XX Century. Foreign poetry translated my M.Zenkevich (1965), American Poetry in M.Zenkevich‚Äôs translations (1969). As the Great Patriotic War started, Zenkevich, unfit for service for health reasons, was evacuated to Chistopol but often went to the frontlines to give poetry recitals, and worked for the radio. In 1947 he joined the CPSU. In 1960 he visited the United States to meet some of the poets whose work he translated, including Mike Gold and Robert Frost. After the War Zenkevich published several books of translated poetry, as well as his own work, Through Thunderstorms of Years (1962) and The Selected Poems (1973). Mikhail Zenkevich died on September 14, 1973, in Moscow.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. History In the 1880s, as shipments of iron ore increased through the Straits of Mackinac, shippers began advocating for better lighting of the shoals in the area. In 1889, Congress appropriated $60,000 to construct three lightvessels to be moored at Simmons Reef, White Shoals, and here at Grays Reef. The three vessels, designated LV55, LV56, and LV57, were constructed by Blythe Craig Shipbuilding Company of Toledo, Ohio, and were put in service in late 1891. LV57 served for every shipping season on Grays Reef until 1923, when its hull had deteriorated to a point where it was removed from service. LV103 (the Lightship Huron) served on Grays reef from 1923‚Äì27, when LV56 was transferred to the station. LV56 lasted only two years until it, too deteriorated enough to be removed from service. LV103 was returned to Grays Reef for the first part of the 1929 season, and was then replaced with LV99. By this time, with improvements in underwater construction, it had become feasible to construct a permanent light station on Grays Reef, rather than depending on a moored lightvessel. In 1934, Congress approved funding for a new station. The Greiling Brothers Company was hired to construct the light station, and work began in the summer of 1934. The structure was finished in September 1936, two months behind schedule and over budget. In 1937, a radio beacon and tower was installed at the station; the tower was removed in 2010. In 1939, the United States Coast Guard took over operational control. The lighthouse was manned until 1976, when a solar- powered system was installed. The lighthouse now has a 12-volt DC acrylic Tideland Signal optic. Description The Grays Reef Light is built to exactly the same plan as the Minneapolis Shoal Light, built at approximately the same time. The design is a modification of one created by F. P. Dillon and W. G. Will, which was used in Conneaut, Ohio and Huron, Ohio. The light sits on a square reinforced concrete pier, high and on a side. Atop the pier is a two-story base, high and on a side. The cellar and first floor in the base were built to house diesel generators, boilers, and compressors to provide power and heat to the light, fog signal, and keeper's quarters. The second floor of the base housed the keeper's quarters. The lighthouse tower is placed in the center of the building roof. The tower is tall, and tapers from at the base to beneath the gallery. The entire light is covered on the exterior with steel plates. The lantern atop the tower has helical astragals, and housed a red 3-1/2 order Fresnel lens.

However, by the 1930s, shipping traffic had shifted far south of the point, and in response funds were appropriated for the Minneapolis Shoal Light Station in 1932. Construction was completed in 1934, and the light was first lit in 1935. The station was later automated in 1979, and is still in use.

Sutermeister. It is considered ‚Äúone of the most detailed documentations about miscarriages of justice in the German language‚Äù.Gilli√©ron, G. Strafbefehlsverfahren und plea bargaining als Quelle von Fehlurteilen. Zurich: Schulthess, 2010, p. 15. It is inspired by Voltaire‚Ä≤s early activism against French miscarriages of justice of puritan origin, as well as by Arthur Conan Doyle‚Ä≤s criminalistic approaches.Sutermeister H M. Summa Iniuria. 1976, pp. 38‚Äì40 and 119‚Äì121. Plot summary The book proposes a legal reform for Switzerland which has never been realized because of political controversies. The Maria Popescu, Pierre Jaccoud, and Vera Br√ºhne cases are discussed in detail, as Sutermeister was involved in the criminal researches. The George Edalji case serves, among others, to illustrate the issue of faulty expertises. The main part consists of the so‚Äìcalled ‚ÄúHirschberg test‚Äù, based on Max Hirschbergs categories of causes of judicial errors. =Hirschberg test= The ‚ÄúHirschberg test‚Äù begins with critique against the preliminary inquiries concerning Josef Issels and Bruno Gr√∂ning. The phenomenon of mis-identification are illustrated by the Joseph Lesurques, Billy Armstrong, Adolph Beck, Leopold Hilsner, Menahem Mendel Beilis, Sacco and Vanzetti, Joe Hill, Caryl Chessman, Charles Townsend, James Hanratty, John Dickman, Rubin Carter, Jerome Frank, Will Purvis, Anna Anderson cases, a large list of experiences which led to wrongful court decisions and which serve to illustrate also other items of the ‚ÄúHirschberg test‚Äù. The issue of uncritical assessment of guilty plea is illustrated by the cases of Timothy Evans, Harold Israel, Marinus van der Lubbe, Albert DeSalvo, Jack the Ripper, Mata Hari, Renate von Natzmer, Danny Escobedo, Richard Speck, and Alfred George Hinds, among others. In the chapter about the impact of fellow convicts on dispensation of justice is considered the judgment of Barbara Graham; and concerning the witness account, the Felix Fechenbach case, the Guillaume Affair, and the cases of Antoine Argoud, Beate Klarsfeld, Milan Bogunovic, Baader-Meinhof, Raoul Villain, Anton Graf von Arco auf Valley, and Maximilian Kolbe. In the cases of Marguerite Steinheil, Leo Frank, Samuel Sheppard, Karl Stauffer, and Ronald Light, the lies of the accused would have offered guilty proof. Circumstantial evidence lawsuits are illustrated by the cases of Frederick Seddon, Marie Besnard, Steven Truscott, Graham Frederick Young, and some white-collar crimes. Suggestibility and emotional biases of the jury as causes of wrongful court decisions are showed by the cases of Jesse Hill Ford, Joan Little, and Alger Hiss. The relationship between miscarriages of justice and public morality are analysed through the cases of Henriette Caillaux, Ruth Ellis, Sir Ewan Forbes, 11th Baronet, Arthur Gray, Horst Schumann, Joan Berry, Baader-Meinhof, Timothy Leary, Patricia Hearst, Kurt Gerstein, Paul Gr√ºninger, Rudolf Roessler, David Frankfurter, Pyotr Grigorenko, Vladimir Bukovsky, Derek Bentley, Edith Thompson, Ivar Kreuger, Stavisky Affair, Harald Feller, Carl Lutz, Viola Liuzzo, Wilma Montesi, Horst Wessel, among many others. The case of Jacques Isorni serves to illustrate certain relationship between law and ethics. The author concludes by briefly analysing other aspects of misleading or other judgments revising the John Thomas Scopes, Carl von Ossietzky, Theodor Lessing, Bruno L√ºdke, Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses in Nazi Germany, Hans Paasche, Ludwig Quidde, and Wei√üe Rose cases. Reception The book has the appearance of a patchwork obtained by stitching together legal and controversial political parts, as has been criticized by German jurist Klaus VolkKlaus Volk. \\"Buchbesprechung: Sutermeister, H.

The election used the thirteen wards created as a result of the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, with each ward electing three or four councillors using the single transferable vote system a form of proportional representation, with 47 councillors being elected. The election saw Labour replace the Scottish Conservative Party as the largest party on the Council as they gained 1 seat while the Tories lost 4 seats. The Scottish National Party retained their third place on the authority but did not gain any additional seats. Independents proved to be the biggest winners as they returned to the Council with 7 seats and 5 net gains which included 2 former members of the Labour party. The Scottish Liberal Democrats proved to be the worst performers of the election, being reduced to just a single seat. Following the election the Conservative Party formed a coalition with the support of the SNP. This replaced the previous Conservative-Lib Dem coalition which existed from 2007-2012.

Overview  The 360 degree sensor was originally designed as a short range micro robot proximity sensor and mainly intended for Swarm robotics, Ant robotics, Swarm intelligence, autonomous Qaudcopter, Drone, UAV, multi-robot simulations e.g. Jasmine Project where 360 proximity sensing is required to avoid collision with other robots and for simple IR inter-robot communications. To overcome certain limitation with Infra-red (IR) proximity sensing (e.g. detection of dark surfaces) the sensing module includes ambient light sensing and basic tactile sensing functionality during forward movement sensing/probing providing photovore and photophobe robot swarm behaviours and characteristics. A project named Sensorium Project was started aimed at broadening the Sensors audience beyond its typical robot sensor usage.

It is known not only for its combination of Western and African styles, but also for its focus on social justice and community improvement. Jazzart Dance Theatre aims to be a trransformative dance company that reflects the changing social environment of South Africa. Meanwhile, Jazzart's training programme provides dance theatre training and creative interventions to South African communities most in need of opportunities to express their artistic impulses. History Jazzart was founded in 1973 by Sonje Mayo as a modern and jazz dance studio open to students of all races. Under the leadership of Sue Parker from 1978 to 1982, the studio evolved into a contemporary jazz school and part-time company, before it was handed over to Val Steyn. In 1986, Alfred Hinkel bought the company, changing artistic directorship to Dawn Langdown, John Linden and Jay Pather. Under this new leadership, the company adopted a philosophy that focused on the socio-political and economic context of their students and audiences. The group became increasingly political throughout the apartheid regime, structuring their teaching around the populist ethos of South African political struggle. Jazzart still strives to bring together all races in South Africa, often performing in disadvantaged communities across the nation. =Awards = *1990 - AA Vita Award for Best Contemporary Choreography Bolero *1994/1995 - FNB Vita Award for Best New South African Production, Medea *1996/1997 - FNB Vita Award for Best Contemporary Choreography Junction *1996/1997 - FNB Vita Award for Most Promising Dancer Sandile Mbili for Junction *1997 - Standard Bank Young Artist Award: Special Award for Dance Alfred Hinkel, for his vision, commitment and contribution to dance in South Africa *1997/1998 - FNB Vita Award for Best Choreography, Ukolu LoMzansi *1997/1998 - FNB Vita Award for Most Promising Performance by a Dancer in Contemporary Style, Celeste Botha *1997/1998 - FNB Vita Award for Best Dancer in Contemporary Style, Sandile Mbili *1998 - Gordon Reid Fellowship: Dance and Theatre, Alfred Hinkel *1998/1999 - FNB Vita Special Award for Cape Town Region Jazzart Dance Theatre for Duck 'n Dance *1999/2000 - FNB Vita Award for Most Promising Choreography Sbonakaliso Ndaba for Sprung 2 *1999/2000 - FNB Vita Special Award for Consistent and Exceptional Performances Throughout the Last Year,.

Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai is a romance visual novel in which the player assumes the role of Ky≈çtar≈ç Kakei. Much of its gameplay is spent reading the text that appears on the screen, which represents the story's narrative and dialogue. The text is accompanied by character sprites, which represent who Ky≈çtar≈ç is talking to, over background art. Throughout the game, the player encounters CG artwork at certain points in the story, which take the place of the background art and character sprites. Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction. There are five main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. Some decisions can lead the game to end prematurely and offer an alternative ending to the plot. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction.

Design and development The Corvus Racer 540 design was started in 2007 when Corvus Aircraft signed a contract with Red Bull to develop a new airplane for P√©ter Besenyei, designed especially for air racing. It was designed by Andras Voloscsuk and the Hungarian University of Aviation. After limited success improving the power output of the existing engine, Besenyei decided to focus on the airframe to reduce drag and improve aerodynamic efficiency. The development engineering time was more than 15,000 hours over two years, and the result was an airplane that was \\"very nice, nice to control\\" although potentially hindered by a heavy engine. The Corvus Racer 540 first appeared at the Apr 2009 AERO Friedrichshafen show in Germany, with initial flight testing in Feb 2010 and its racing debut in June 2010 at the Red Bull Air Race in Windsor, Ontario, Canada during the fourth race out of six in the 2010 Red Bull racing season. Besenyei placed 10th at Windsor, 8th at New York, and 9th at Lausitz all with the Corvus Racer 540. Unfortunately, the 7th and 8th races of the 2010 race series were cancelled and as of April 2012 the series had yet to resume, thus reducing motivation for further development of the design.

Coming after the capture of Sattelberg by the Allies, the battle took place amidst the Australian advance north towards Sio. The Australians committed elements from four infantry brigades from the Australian 9th Division with supporting elements including artillery, engineers and tank support, while the Japanese force consisted primarily of two depleted infantry regiments from the 20th Division, with limited artillery support. The Australian advance in this region developed into three drives. In the west, forces advanced north from Sattelberg following its capture, while in the east, an advance was made from North Hill on the coast, north of Scarlet Beach, where the Australians had landed earlier in the campaign. A smaller drive was made in the centre from Nongora, which lay in between the two, although this was limited and subsequently linked up with the coastal drive. Although possessing significant forces, the Australian advance proved slow. Heavy rain and harsh terrain slowed the Australian resupply efforts and reduced the mobility of their manoeuvre elements. Disease and fatigue also heavily depleted their infantry, with more casualties being suffered from illnesses than combat. The Japanese units in the area also defended strongly, but they too were short on supplies and in the end they were forced to withdraw further north. Wareo subsequently fell to the Allies on 8 December, who then established a line east from Wareo to Gusika on the coast. From there they carried out further advances north later in the month and into early January 1944. Background Map showing location Wareo, New Guinea In September 1943, Australian forces launched the first phase of Operation Cartwheel, General Douglas MacArthur's advance on the main Japanese base at Rabaul. The operation initially went well. Lae fell on 16 September,. and having advanced north along the coast towards the Huon Peninsula, the Australians had the Japanese forces on the back foot. On 22 September, elements of the Australian 9th Division, commanded by Major General George Wootten, landed at Scarlet Beach from where they began to fan out to the south and west to capture Finschhafen and to begin the advance towards Sio, further around the coast on the northern side of the Huon Peninsula... Up to this point the Allied advance had been faster than planned, but at Finschhafen it faltered. The rapid advance had created logistical difficulties. In particular, the engineers required to develop the captured areas were not yet available. This became critical when heavy rains delayed the opening of the Lae‚ÄìNadzab Road. Without the road, the planned airbase at Nadzab could not be developed,. and without the airbase, air cover could not be provided for another amphibious operation. MacArthur was forced to postpone the next phase of Cartwheel, Operation Dexterity, the landing on New Britain.. The initiative now passed to the Japanese. As the Australians advanced, a large force of Japanese ‚Äì consisting largely of the 79th and 80th Infantry Regiments, part of the 26th Field Artillery Regiment and a battalion of the 238th Infantry Regiment, which were grouped together as the 20th Division under Lieutenant General Shigeru Katagiri ‚Äì launched an unsuccessful counter-attack in October before retreating inland towards an abandoned German mission that sat atop a peak at Sattelberg.. By 5 November, General Headquarters (GHQ) South West Pacific Area (SWPA) had decided that the Finschhafen area would be developed into a major air and naval base,. but the large Japanese force on Sattelberg still overlooked the base area. In order to remove this threat, Wootten sent the 26th Infantry Brigade to capture Sattelberg on 16 November.. On 25 November, after 10 days of fighting, and an advance up the southern approaches from Jivevaneng by infantry supported by artillery, armour and air support, Sattelberg was seized by the Australians. Having suffered heavy casualties, and short on supplies, the Japanese withdrew north to Wareo,. where they established themselves in preparation for further attacks by the Australians.. Logistics =Allied= Allied supplies were hauled from Lae in the Landing Craft, Vehicle, Personnel and Landing Craft Mechanised of the US 2nd Engineer Special Brigade, affectionately known as the \\"9th Division Navy\\". The capture of Dreger Harbour and Langemak Bay provided sheltered unloading areas, although they had not yet been developed into ports. This allowed the 2nd Engineer Special Brigade to make supply runs every second day. During October, its boats made 3,870 trips totalling , and carried 5,930 troops and of cargo.. These were supplemented by less frequent trips by the much larger Landing Craft Tank and Landing Ships Tank of the VII Amphibious Force, which brought up tanks and artillery pieces. Their capacity was not as great as it could have been because, due to fear of Japanese air attacks, they had to quickly unload in the darkness.. Some 800 men were employed by day and 800 by night unloading craft on the beaches. By 1 November, there were 12,000 rounds of 25 pounder ammunition in the Finschhafen area, and stocks were increasing at a rate of two LCM loads per day.. After unloading at Finschhafen, supplies were moved overland to where they were needed by jeeps, and where the terrain prevented this, by hand. In this regard, some New Guinean labourers were employed, but a shortage of such personnel resulted in the Australians allocating some of their combat troops to this role.. The wounded were taken to the aid posts and dressing stations in the field, and then to the 2/3rd Casualty Clearing Station, which arrived at Langemak Bay in October,. or the 2/2nd Casualty Clearing Station, which opened at Heldsbach Plantation in November.. Patients evacuated by sea on the small Australian Army hospital ship Stradbroke II, and later the improvised American Army hospital ship Norab.Norab (Baron backward) was the 1928 built yacht owned by American club and hotel owner Baron Long. Leased to the Army the ship was operated by the U.S. Army's Small Ships (#S206) crewed largely by Australians. The vessel had been fitted with bunks for 64 stretcher cases and space for 100 walking wounded. See Air evacuation began when the airstrip at Finschhafen was opened in December.. Large numbers of Australian and American troops began arriving in November to develop the base at Finschhafen. There were US Army engineers to develop the airbase, and US Navy Seabees to build a PT Boat at Dreger Harbour. The Finschhafen Base Sub Area, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel H. T. Allan, was formed in November to support Australian operations in the area. Its American counterpart, known as Base F, followed on 15 November.. =Japanese= The Japanese also relied upon water transport for logistics during the battle. Due to heavy shipping losses earlier in the year during the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, they employed a small force of submarines in an effort to avoid Allied air attack.. Closer to the battle zone, barges were used to augment these submarines, but they too proved vulnerable to attack by Allied aircraft and PT boats.. The distribution of Japanese supplies was hampered by the lack of native carriers, which the Japanese had been unable to recruit due to an Allied propaganda campaign in the region. In addition, there was a lack of motor transport and the track system was under developed.. As a result, distribution of supplies once they had been landed was undertaken by resupply parties which were drawn largely from combat units. These parties moved overland on foot using a number of key tracks that existed north of the Wareo‚ÄìGusika ridge.. Prelude Shortly after the Australians had landed at Scarlet Beach in late September, they began to patrol the area north of there towards Bonga and Gusika. Several key tracks and junctions were located by troops from the 2/43rd Infantry Battalion,. who named them \\"Imperial\\", \\"Oriental\\", \\"Norfolk\\" and \\"Exchange\\", after Adelaide pubs.. Through the use of aerial reconnaissance evidence was found that the Japanese were using these tracks to traverse the area and to move supplies west towards Sattelberg. Observation posts were established and it became apparent to the Australians that one hill in particular, a feature later dubbed \\"Pabu\\" by the Australians after one of their native scouts, was the key terrain in the area. Part of an area that later became known as \\"Horace the Horse\\" to the Australians due to its shape as viewed from the air,. it was within artillery range of the Australian forward positions at North Hill and as such could be occupied and held by a small party who could then disrupt the Japanese supply line. In October, the Japanese had launched a counter-attack in the region and as the Australians had been forced back, they were forced to abandon Pabu. The October counter-attack was turned back. The commander of the Japanese XVIII Army, Lieutenant General Hataz≈ç Adachi, visited Katagiri's command post, and ordered a renewal of the attack, which Katagiri scheduled for 23 November.. Meanwhile, the Australians sought to regain the initiative. Wootten decided to establish a position in depth behind the Japanese forward line, and subsequently further efforts were made to establish a force at Pabu in front of the Australian forward line at North Hill.. Three companies from the 2/32nd Infantry Battalion under Major Bill Mollard, were sent to occupy it in mid-November, and after striking north of the Song River from North Hill, with the help of native scouts, they moved between the Japanese positions as \\"Exchange\\" and \\"Pino Hill\\". Following a heavy bombardment from the field guns of the 2/12th Field Regiment firing from Heldsbach Plantation, they captured the position. Over the next few days, the Australians established themselves, and began patrolling operations. After bringing up mortars and Vickers medium machine guns, they began to attack the Japanese resupply parties moving through the area, inflicting heavy casualties.. As a result of the occupation of Pabu, and the general movement of Australian forces towards Wareo‚ÄìBonga, the Japanese infantry were threatened with being trapped. In response, the Japanese commander, Katagiri, diverted some of the effort away from the recapture of Finschhafen, and resolved to recapture the North Hill‚ÄìPabu area.. A strong force of Japanese subsequently advanced south along the coastal track from Bonga, attempting to retake North Hill and the ground north of the Song River.. Commencing on 22 November, the Japanese made heavy assaults around North Hill, on positions which were defended by Australians from the 2/43rd Infantry Battalion and the 2/2nd Machine Gun Battalion. The 2/32nd, with two companies isolated to the north around Pabu, was also in the thick of the fighting, and over the space of 10 days it was subjected to repeated attacks. Despite being short of food and receiving repeated mortar fire, the 2/32nd held its ground with the assistance of strong artillery support,. and in doing so inflicted heavy casualties upon the Japanese.. Later at least 195 bodies were found around the 2/32nd's position; their own losses amounted to 25 killed and 51 wounded.. The Japanese commanding general, Hatazo Adachi, later pinpointed the Australian capture of Pabu Hill as one of the main reasons for the defeat of his force during the Huon Peninsula campaign.. The Japanese counter-attacks were eventually repulsed and after this, the Australians resumed their advance.. The plan called for a three-pronged attack by a divisional sized force of around 13,000 men.. While the 26th Infantry Brigade advanced to Wareo, the 24th Infantry Brigade took up a position on their right with the intention of capturing the area from Gusika on the coast to the \\"Lakes\\", two large water features about inland. The 20th Infantry Brigade advanced in the centre between the 24th and 26th Infantry Brigades, striking out for Wareo from Nongora. Meanwhile, the 4th Infantry Brigade was assigned to defend the Allied beachhead around Finschhafen and Heldsbach, although it would later be employed in the coastal drive.. Battle =Pursuit of Japanese forces to Bonga= Battle of Wareo, 1943 Along the coast, the 2/28th Infantry Battalion was assigned the task of leading the Australian advance along with a troop from the 1st Tank Battalion and engineers from the 2/7th Field Company. Commencing in the afternoon of 27 November,. they began clearing operations between Bonga and North Hill along the coast with a secondary task of sending a company towards Pabu to facilitate the relief of the 2/32nd. In the vicinity, the Japanese 20th Division, consisting of the remnants of the 79th, 80th and 238th Infantry Regiments, numbered 4,670 men, of which 2,500 were combat effective.. The lead company of the 2/28th Infantry Battalion moved off shortly after midday, passing through the 2/43rd Infantry Battalion's lines. Initially there was no opposition and by the afternoon they established a defensive position near a waterfall. The following morning, the advance continued. The ground astride the coastal track, although flat, was covered in dense jungle, which was not suitable for tracked vehicles to move across. The result of this was that the Australian tanks had to remain on the track, advancing behind the infantry, which limited the rate of their advance and prevented them from being able to apply the full weight of their firepower.. As the Australians advanced, the engineers used bulldozers to improve the track to facilitate the flow of supplies, nevertheless the advance was slow. Sabotage of the bridges that spanned the various creeks that crossed the track held up the tanks, which were forced to wait while engineers came forward. While a bridge was being prepared for the tanks to cross a stream, attempts were made to attack the Japanese with infantry, however the ground was too rough and hard to penetrate and after suffering two casualties, the attack was called off. The Japanese attempted to delay the oncoming Australian units with snipers and suicide actions, however the supporting fire from the Australian tanks, which had joined the combat after crossing the stream and which at some points closed to to fire at the Japanese,. was used effectively where Japanese resistance was heaviest. In the face of this, the Japanese fell back. At the same time, a platoon advanced north from Pabu and occupied a position named \\"Exchange\\" by the Australians, capturing a 75 mm artillery piece in the process. The two companies from the 2/32nd Infantry Battalion around Pabu had been reinforced by the remaining two companies which had fought their way through on 26 November, having also captured \\"Pino Hill\\" with four Matilda tanks and artillery support.. They were then relieved by the 2/43rd, who were warned out to begin an advance to the west. The following morning, 29 November, the 2/28th Infantry Battalion once again led the Australian advance. By mid-morning Bonga had been taken and shortly after midday, Australian reconnaissance patrols found Gusika undefended and so the main body subsequently occupied a local feature called \\"Oriental\\" to its south. It was the site of a large Japanese headquarters, but was found to be abandoned, with piles of equipment left behind.

The fall of Bonga put the Japanese forces firmly on the back foot; their supply route through Bonga having been cut, they had to send supplies and reinforcements along the rough track that passed between Kiligia and Wareo. The next step for the Australians was the capture of Gusika to the north on the coast and a position known as \\"Horace's Ears\\" further inland to the west. To that point, the advance had been going well for the Australians, so they split their forces, with the 2/28th pushing on to Gusika and the 2/43rd turning west towards \\"Horace\\". At this point the Australian forces received a boost in the form of the 4th Infantry Brigade, which was assigned to the 9th Division to begin the advance north up the coastal track towards the high features that existed around Fortification Point. At the same time, the 24th Infantry Brigade would advance on Wareo from Bonga, in the east. The terrain over which the two brigades were to advance was generally steep with the track having been cut along a high spur line that dropped on either side into deep ravines that were covered by kunai grass interspersed with areas of thick jungle. North of Bonga, the ground was markedly different, with the track having been pushed through flat swamp land that was punctuated by many deep creeks; vegetation in the area was mainly thick secondary growth, although to the west, in the steep hills, kunai grass was predominate. As a result of the harsh conditions and terrain, as the Australian advance continued it was increasingly hampered by vehicle break downs and fatigue amongst their crews. Resupply was also a problem for the Australians and consequently a lack of spare parts developed. This meant that a number of jeeps became unserviceable and some of the Matilda tanks were unable to advance for some time while their crews waited for parts to be brought up. =Japanese stand at Horace's Ears= By 30 November, the Australian commander, Wootten, had concentrated a significant force, consisting of 12 infantry battalions, a machine gun battalion, a Matilda tank squadron, a battalion of pioneers, a squadron of commandos, and artillery and engineer support, and was ready to begin the next stage of the advance.. The advance began that morning with the 2/28th Infantry Battalion advancing on the Australian right in concert with the Matildas from 3 Troop, 1st Tank Battalion. Crossing the Kalueng River, they penetrated only before meeting Japanese resistance, which was overcome with the assistance of an artillery barrage and mortars. At the same time, the 2/43rd, which had relieved the 2/32nd around Pabu earlier, also advanced. Two companies were sent out late in the afternoon, each with armoured support in the shape of two Matildas, tasked with taking the position known by the Australians as \\"Horace's Ears\\" by advancing through an area of low ground dubbed \\"Lilac Valley\\" by the Australians. The Japanese had developed the position considerably, establishing a complex defensive network and, whereas up until that point they had usually withdrawn in the face of the advancing Australians, they decided to make a stand. Employing a 75 mm gun, which was fired over open sights due to the closeness of the fighting, along with some 37 mm guns and a number of machine guns of varying calibre, they fought fiercely. Halted by fire, the Australians called in fire support to overwhelm the Japanese with fire superiority, and resorting to employing the indirect method that would characterise their operations during this phase of the advance, and which was necessitated by the depleted state of their forces. Moving up a steep slope that was covered by kunai grass, one of the tanks broke down, nevertheless the Australian armour was able to deliver a significant bombardment which enabled the infantry to take the position early in the evening. =Kalueng Lakes= Operations in the Finschhafen area The 2/28th Infantry Battalion put a patrol over the Kalueng River on 1 December. The previous day artillery had been used to reduce the Japanese presence in the area of the \\"Lagoon\\" ‚Äì north of Gusika ‚Äì and, as a consequence, the patrol was able to penetrate deep to the north, almost reaching the Lagoon before turning around. On the return leg, the Australians located a Japanese position and attacked it, killing one and wounding three others before skirting around the position and moving south in an effort to regain Australian lines.. A second Japanese force, however, blocked their way and after a firefight at sunset in which a further three Australians were wounded, they were forced back to the north, where they established a defensive position. Runners were sent out to take a message through to the battalion headquarters. Both men never made it, though, being killed after encountering several Japanese. After darkness fell and it began to rain, the patrol, however, was able to extricate itself back to the river where they spent the night before rejoining their battalion early on 2 December. The troop of tanks that had initially been committed was at this point relieved, with another ‚Äì an ad hoc formation drawn from Headquarters Troop and 2 Troop from the 1st Tank Battalion ‚Äì being brought up to replace them. In concert with a company from 2/43rd, five tanks struck out from Pabu on 2 December. The tanks were kept in reserve at this stage and one broke down early in the advance. Together, the force penetrated close to the Lakes, but a Japanese force moved to cut off their rear, forcing them back. A second company from the 2/43rd, also with tank support, was then thrown forward to conduct a move to flank towards the larger of the two water features, approaching from the south. The Japanese were positioned in strength in a heavily wooded area and began firing on the Australians with machine guns, which pinned them down until two tanks came up and destroyed the Japanese position, firing from point blank range. At this point, the Australians lost another tank, which became bogged in the mud and which had to be left with an infantry guard to defend it while the advance continued. By mid-afternoon, the 2/43rd's second company's advance was checked again, having progressed a further . At this point, the last tank, named \\"Costello\\" by its crew, moved forward to provide support. As it came up past the infantry, it was fired upon from Japanese artillery positioned on some high ground to the north of the lake. It was initially fired upon by a 37 mm gun, which fired from about away, before that was joined by 75 mm artillery piece. Despite being hit more than 50 times, the tank's crew remained unhurt and were able to keep firing the tank's 2 pounder until they eventually had to abandon the tank and fall back with the infantry. At this point, the Australians withdrew. Overnight, the Japanese pulled the two guns off the high ground and left a small force behind which was quickly overwhelmed by the Australians when they resumed their advance the following day. The Australian infantry suffered further casualties when they approached the previously abandoned \\"Costello\\" and triggered a mine that had been set by the withdrawing Japanese. The advance was slow, though, and in order to support the 2/43rd, the 2/32nd was brought forward again. Together the composite force overcame the Japanese resistance around the Lakes around midday on 3 December, and at this point they were re-tasked with taking over the drive in the central sector from the 20th Infantry Brigade, which was to be rested for later in the campaign, and pushing on to the Christmas Hills. =Nongora and Christmas Hills= Although originally the whole 20th Infantry Brigade had been assigned the task of advancing through the Australian centre towards Nongora, in the end only one infantry battalion, the 2/15th, and a platoon from the Papuan Infantry Battalion was committed. Stepping off on 30 November, this force struck north from Nongora towards the Song River. The lead company crossed the river west of a fjord and shortly after completing this manoeuvre, a force of Japanese engaged them with machine gun fire, killing one and wounding three others. Still in contact, the Australian company secured the crossing enabling two other companies from the 2/15th to come across. While the lead company fixed the Japanese position, the other two conducted a passage of lines manoeuvre and bypassed the Japanese machine gun position as they continued the advance towards Nongora. The lead company then also broke contact and followed them, and in the early afternoon, finding themselves confronted by a high feature to their front which blocked their path east towards Nongora, they established a defensive position short of their objective; meanwhile, the 2/15th's fourth company, following up in reserve, found the Japanese machine gun position abandoned and subsequently occupied it. On 1 December, the Australians began to prepare to capture the high ground to their front. Japanese had been seen atop it and in the early afternoon a company-level attack was put in on the southern end of the feature. Suffering 13 casualties, the Australians were beaten back, however, during the night the Japanese withdrew from the ridge. The following day, the Australians discovered this and began following them up; by midday they had entered Nongora and established themselves there.. Once this was completed, the 2/15th began to send out patrols to the west to probe the Christmas Hills, and to the east towards the Kalueng Lakes, to make contact with the 24th Infantry Brigade.. This was affected the following day. At the same time, the 2/15th probed the Christmas Hills area, where they were engaged by the Japanese about south of the feature, with one of their officers being killed.. Another patrol was sent out by the 2/15th in the early afternoon of 4 December. Advancing on the eastern side of the main track they were able to penetrate deep towards the hills, before finding their way barred by a deep gorge which forced them to turn back. At this point, the Australian commander issued a new operation order, reassigning the task of capturing the Christmas Hills area to the 24th Infantry Brigade and pulling the 20th Infantry Brigade back to Nongora to rest up for the next phase of the campaign, which would see them advance up the coast.. The strain of the advance along the coastal route, which had been the 24th Infantry Brigade's main effort, however, had taken its toll. As a result, the 2/32nd Infantry Battalion was called forward again as the 2/28th was plagued by sickness and the 2/43rd was physically worn out.. On the night of 4/5 December, the Japanese withdrew from their forward positions, leaving behind a large quantity of equipment and their dead. The following morning, a composite force of Australians from the 2/32nd and 2/43rd Infantry Battalions then took up the advance towards the Christmas Hills, ranging west, and undertaking a series of flanking moves in order to break into the Japanese main defensive position, where the Japanese were well-entrenched. A firefight ensued in which six Japanese and seven Australians were killed, before the Australian attack was turned back.. On 6 December the Australians attacked again, this time with two companies approaching from the north-east, using an intense artillery and mortar bombardment to prepare the area first; the attack was repulsed with heavy fire. A further barrage rained down on the Japanese and by sunset, the 2/32nd Infantry Battalion, severely depleted with most its companies ‚Äì several of which were commanded by junior non commissioned officers due to heavy casualties amongst the subalterns ‚Äì at platoon strength, had managed to establish a lodging near the top of the feature on its eastern approach. That night the Japanese fell back from the position and the following day the Australians occupied Christmas Hills.. =Drive on Kuanko and Wareo= In the west, the 26th Infantry Brigade had begun patrolling operations north of Sattelberg on 27 November, moving towards the Song River.. The distance to Wareo was , but due to the type of terrain, the actual distance to be traversed was about quadruple that.. The 2/23rd Infantry Battalion was given the task of leading the Australian advance in this sector and after striking north from Masangkoo, they moved towards Fior, with the task for finding a river crossing for the brigade. No crossing could be found. At the same time the 2/24th set out from Palanko in search of jungle tracks towards the river. Flank protection on the left was provided by the 2/4th Commando Squadron and a platoon from the Papuan Infantry Battalion.. The search was unsuccessful and after minor clashes occurred, the Australians dispatched two platoons to Fior in an effort to link up with the 2/23rd. Short of Fior, the Japanese had established themselves in strength in well dug-in positions amidst a thick bamboo grove. As the 2/24th's platoons approached, they were fired upon and forced to halt their advance, establishing a night defensive position. During the night the Japanese withdrew silently and moved back across the Song, destroying the suspension bridge that spanned it as they went. They established themselves on the opposite side of the river and waited for the Australians to follow after them. The next morning, when the two Australian battalions rose they discovered that the ground in front of them was undefended and they advanced unopposed towards Fior. The 2/23rd advanced down the steep escarpment towards Fior, descending some into the valley through which the river flowed, crossing several creeks and entering the undefended town. The lead company from the 2/23rd Infantry Battalion then exploited towards the river, looking for a crossing. They found the bridge near the main crossing destroyed and about from the river, began receiving fire from the opposite bank. The Australians then sent out patrols to scout other potential crossings; one was found and by the early evening the Australians had established themselves on the other side of the Song. Early on 30 November, the single company from the 2/23rd that had made it across the Song was joined by another. Together they moved up the steep slope to the Kuanko Track where they split up: one company went north to continue the advance, while the other turned to the south to attack the Japanese that had fired upon them earlier, taking them from the rear. Two attacks were put in against the rearguard of this position, achieving a break-in, which was then exploited by a platoon, which attacked with fixed bayonets, capturing the position. A total of 30 Japanese were killed or wounded in the attack and a short time later, the rest of the 2/23rd was able to exploit the main river crossing. Meanwhile, the company that had struck north continued to advance. They were about north of the river when their advance was checked, at which point the 2/23rd formed a defensive harbour to wait out the night. Late that afternoon, after about a week of dry weather, it began to rain. As a result, the track became more difficult and mobility was reduced; the tanks found the track impassable and as a consequence the advancing Australian infantry lost their direct fire support. Resupply also proved to be a problem for them. The jeeps that had been bringing up supplies could not get forward and there were not enough native porters to meet the demand. As a result, the Australians had to resort to using one of their infantry battalions, the 2/24th, to bring supplies forward from Palanko while the 2/23rd continued the advance on Kuanko. Several isolated pockets of Japanese defenders were located along the track holding and so, while their sister battalion struggled up and down the steep track under the weight of their portage, on 1 December elements of the 2/23rd, leaving their heavy stores and equipment behind, advanced up a steep, muddy slope and set about clearing these positions. The Japanese resistance was overwhelmed and by midday the Australians entered Kuanko. Exploiting beyond the village in the afternoon, the lead Australian company took fire from a ridge line to the north-west and the advance was halted for the day. The next morning the Australians sent out patrols and as they probed forward through the dense bamboo it became apparent to them that the Japanese had established themselves in strength along a ridge line that stretched off to a position called Peak Hill.. In response to the Australian patrols, the Japanese raked the jungle with machine gun fire to which the Australians responded by calling in an artillery and mortar bombardment. As the sun began to set, the Japanese launched a quick attack on the lead Australian company, forcing them back. In order to regain the initiative, the 2/23rd Infantry Battalion launched a night attack, which, although supported by very accurate artillery fire from the 2/12th Field Regiment, proved unsuccessful. As a result of the failed attack, in the morning the Australians found themselves in a position overlooked by the Japanese. Throughout the day, both sides exchanged sniper fire and the Australians had to re-route their supply lines after they came under fire from the high ground. A company from the 2/24th was released from their portage tasks and were brought up to bolster the 2/23rd, taking up a position to the south in close proximity. During the night, however, the Japanese began to encircle the Australian position. In response, the company from the 2/24th moved to link up with the 2/23rd. Just short of the position, their advance was checked when they came under heavy fire; the Australians eventually managed to send out a patrol which outflanked the Japanese positions and linked up with the 2/23rd. Australian troops from the 2/24th Infantry Battalion carry supplies up from Sattelberg towards the 2/23rd Infantry Battalion as they advanced towards Wareo By 5 December, the Australians had managed to stockpile enough supplies in forward areas to enable the 2/24th Infantry Battalion, which had been engaged in moving the stores, to be released from this task and thrown back into the fighting. In order to bypass the Japanese position, elements from the 2/23rd along with one company from the 2/24th carried out flanking manoeuvres to the west of the track were undertaken before the Australians established themselves in defensive positions short of Peak Hill. On 6 December, the remaining three companies of the 2/24th came up and as the Australians continued to advance towards Peak Hill they found considerable Japanese positions which had been abandoned. As movement was seen in Wareo, which was visible in the distance, an artillery bombardment was called in by the Australians.. In the afternoon, the Australians cut the branch track that turned towards Kwatingkoo before an attack was put in on Peak Hill. The Japanese defences held and the attack beaten off, the Australians attempted to outflank to the north but they were prevented from doing so by the thick jungle and as the sun set, they had to be content to dig-in on the western approach to Peak Hill. Once again the Japanese withdrew during the night and early the following morning, 7 December, the Australians were able to capture the hill.. Throughout the morning, they continued to advance until they were halted by fire about from Wareo. A brief halt was called at this time, while patrols were sent out to Kwatingkoo to determine the strength of the Japanese there. It was found to be heavily defended. Later in the day, elements of the 2/24th and the 2/32nd established contact, forming a link between the 24th and 26th Infantry Brigades. At this point fatigue amongst the Australians stalled their advance; it did not last long, though, and early on 8 December Kwatingkoo was captured by elements of the 2/24th Infantry Battalion without opposition as its defenders had fallen back earlier. Follow up moves advanced them towards Wareo and by mid-morning it too had been captured. Aftermath Mortars from the Australian 2/23rd Infantry Battalion bombard Japanese positions along the Wareo‚ÄìBonga track The Australian advance had been hampered by bad weather, steep terrain, supply problems, fatigue and the strong defence mounted by the Japanese,. nevertheless they had secured the Wareo‚ÄìGusika spur and the track that ran between Wareo and Bonga. In the face of the Australian advance on Wareo, early in December the Japanese commander, Katagiri, had ordered his troops, who were weary from the fighting and hungry due to a lack of supplies, to fall back to the north.. The 79th Infantry Regiment, which had been defending the area around the Lakes, was ordered to move back to Kalasa and Sio, while the 80th Infantry Regiment, having been located around Kuanko, followed the 79th and moved east towards the coast.. The Australians were also in need of rest and were suffering heavily from tropical diseases, which had inflicted more casualties than Japanese actions in this phase of the campaign.. Nevertheless, after the fall of Wareo, fighting in the area continued. In order to enable the two main Japanese infantry regiments to make a clean break, the 2nd Battalion, 238th Infantry Regiment, carried out rearguard operations in the Wareo area until 15 December.. On 8 December, shortly after the capture of Kwatingkoo, a company from the 2/24th Infantry Battalion was ambushed while moving towards Bazuluo; eight Australians were killed and another four wounded.. A strong force of Japanese also held out on the 2200 feature, which lay about north-east of Wareo, threatening the Australian hold on the newly won Wareo‚ÄìBonga track. On 12 December, the fighting in the Wareo region intensified briefly when a significant clash occurred on the hill. Concerned about the presence of the Japanese rearguard, the Australians sent a force from the 2/24th Infantry Battalion to assault the Japanese that were ensconced there. A pitched battle followed in which 27 Japanese and three Australians were killed, before the Australians captured the position.. Elsewhere, the Allies landed at Arawe on New Britain on 15 December, while the Australian 4th Infantry Brigade, having commenced its advance up the coast from Gusika on 3 December,. continued on passing through Bald Hill, Lakona and Kiligia on its way to Fortification Point as it led the opening phase of the Australian advance towards Sio.. In late December, the 20th Infantry Brigade, which had largely been rested during the advance on Wareo, took over from the 4th. After sweeping up the coast quickly against light Japanese resistance, they captured Sio in early January 1944, having suffered only very light casualties. After the war, the Australian Army commemorated the battle, and the fighting that occurred on its periphery, through the awarding of a number of battle honours: \\"Pabu\\", \\"Gusika\\", \\"Wareo\\" and \\"Nongora\\". The 2/32nd and 2/43rd Infantry Battalions both received \\"Pabu\\", while the 2/28th was awarded \\"Gusika\\". The 1st Tank Battalion and the 2/23rd and 24th Infantry Battalions received \\"Wareo\\", and \\"Nongora\\" went to the 2/15th.. Casualties during the capture of Wareo and Gusika over the 26 November to 7 December period were reported by the Australian II Corps Headquarters as follows: 451 Japanese killed, as well as 40 found dead, and one captured. Against this, 47 Australians were killed and 332 were reported wounded.  Footnotes  Notes References       Further reading * External links *Launch jetty, Finschhafen, New Guinea. 1944-01.

Gameplay The game centers around the quest of Prince Cirion of Morenor attempting to save the kingdom from an evil spell of the demonworld queen Medusa who has split his country and forced him into exile.

To achieve this, the protagonist Cirion trades with goods between towns, whereas he is subject to bandit attacks (scouts increase view range to enable avoiding them). On the map the player may also dig for treasures, conquer cities and install troops to defend that town, and later cross the large ocean and visit other islands. Within the game, the player controls directly only the squadron that Cirion is with, the other troops use a defense plan chosen previously. When the player visits a city, a control screen appears, with options to sell and buy wares, gamble in the casino, gather information on temples and recruit troops.

The Company Man begins addressing the people of the town but is interrupted when a woman (Francine Morgan) strapped with explosives emerges from the crowd. A masked man who has hijacked the tannoy system (Jordan Bernarde) threatens to detonate the bomb if the company do not leave the town. Before anything happens, The Teacher appears at the waves and walks to the woman, talking to her. He discovers that her name is Joanna and asks her to tell him her story. He removes the bomb and the two embrace, but before any of the security or police can speak with them, they are gone. The bomber is arrested and taken away. Later that day ICU holds a conference at the town hall to discuss their plans for the town. The Company man speaks to the Mayor (Ken Tucker) about why he can't tell the people of the town that they will all be moved on, and that he must lie to them. The Company Man takes to the mic and explains to the people of the town that in addition to the M4 motorway that runs through the town, the company will be adding a new road, entitled the Passover Project. He explains that families whose houses stand in the way will be rehomed. The people of the town start to revolt, until one woman is shot by the Security Chief. The Teacher appears and cradles her. When questioned by the Company Man about what he wants, he replies, 'I came here to listen!' The teacher gathers more followers: a fisherman, Peter (David Rees Talbot), Alfie (Darren Lawrence), a man who is haunted by the ghosts of people who used to live in his street, homeless twins with no name whom he calls Legion (John- Paul Macleod, Matthew Aubrey), his brother whom he doesn't recognise, Kyle (Kyle Rees) and a musician, Simon (Matt Woodyatt). At the shopping centre, his mother finds him, but he doesn't recognise her. Later that night, The Teacher and his friends celebrate at Peter's local club. The Teacher is volunteered to draw the raffle, and his mother approaches him again. She gives him a photograph of him and his daughter, whom he doesn't remember. The encounter visibly moves him, and he calls Joanne into a back room. There he asks her to give him up to ICU's security, and she reluctantly agrees. The friends stumble outside drunkenly, and there The Teacher sees visions of three women: his daughter, his wife and his mother-in-law. He then sees a vision of the Security Chief, covered in blood and adorned with antlers. He asks him to tell him his story, but the vision replies, 'I have no story. I am.' The visions disappear and The Teacher notices a roofer at work on a nearby house. The roofer is his father, and for a brief moment, he recognises him. His father explain that he has lost a piece of slate from the roof and asks his son to find it. When he does, it's broken, and his father explains that sometimes you have to sacrifice one piece of slate to realise that the roof needs to be fixed. The Teacher reluctantly agrees and is arrested by a local police office, Sgt. Phillips (Kristian Phillips). He is taken to the back of a flat- bed truck where the Security Chief tells him he knows everything about him, about his failed marriage and how he never gets to see his daughter any more. He accuses The Teacher of leading an uprising against ICU and tells him that the people of the town look to him as their king. At that moment, Peter is being quizzed by a local news team about whether he is affiliated with The Teacher, but he denies ever knowing him. The Teacher reluctantly admits his is the king of the town, knowing that he is the piece of slate that is sacrificed to save the whole roof. The following day The Teacher and the bomber from the beach, Barry Absalum, are tried. Barry is set free and The Teacher is found guilty by the Company Man. Peter tries to stop the events happening by declaring that he does know The Teacher, but it is too late. He is dragged into the town centre and is beaten by the security team. They dress him in a nighty and place a crown of barbed wire upon his head to humiliate him. Sgt Phillips and the rest of the local police refuse to participate. The Teacher is bundled into a van and driven to a local stonemasons, where he is handed a cross. He then follows Simon's drum, and a procession of all the people in the town begin to walk. The Teacher collapses and is carried into the town centre, where his mother bathes his wounds and replaces his crown with one of roses. The procession continues until they reach the beach, where a podium built of all of the doors of the people of the town stands. The Teacher is stripped and nailed to the cross and raised above the town. As he hangs, a picture of his daughter comes alive in his mind and suddenly he remembers. We cut to The Teacher's video diary of his forty missing days, where he flees to the hills surrounding the town due to pressure in his life. He lives happily in the hills, free from his troubles, remarking about the M4 motorway that scars the town. He states that 'Nobody stops in Port Talbot'. On the fortieth day, when journeying into the town for food, he gets lost and begins to forget who he is. It is at this moment that he stumbles down to the beach where he is held under the water by The Stranger. With his memory restored, The Teacher begins to cry out about all of the memories of the town until the skyline is lit with a burst of light and all of the town is brought back to life with old memories. After he dies, his followers wrap him in cloth and lower him gently, where his mother cradles his body and sings to him. Joanne approaches to remove the cloth to show the town their hero one last time, but when she does, his body is gone and in his place are hundreds of flowers. The Stranger appears on the podium, exclaiming, 'It is finished, it has begun!' and pulls back his hood to reveal himself as The Teacher.

He played in the Football League for Hartlepool United. Career Simms made his Irish League debut aged 15 for his hometown club, Larne, before his performances soon earned him a move to England. He signed for English First Division side Wolverhampton Wanderers in Summer 1997 for ¬£40,000. During almost four years at Molineux, he failed to make a first team appearances, and departed for Third Division Hartlepool United on a free transfer in March 2001 after completing a trial with them. The defender made his Football League debut on 15 September 2001 when he came on as a substitute during a goalless draw at Southend United. This was the first of eleven appearances during the season as the club reached the play-offs. However, he made only two appearances further appearances during the following season, the last being in a 0‚Äì5 exit from the Football League Trophy at the hands of Tranmere. During this time he won fourteen caps for the Northern Ireland under-21 side. The first coming on 27 March 2001 in a European qualifier against Bulgaria. He had previously represented them at schoolboy, under-18 and under-16 level. Simms was released by Hartlepool at the end of the 2002‚Äì03 season and returned to his native Northern Ireland to join Derry City. However, he soon departed on loan to Ballymena United in early 2004; a move made permanent that summer. After two and a half years at The Showgrounds, he signed a short-term deal with Finn Harps in the League of Ireland First Division in January 2007. At the conclusion of this, he returned to English football by signing for non-league club Hednesford Town for the 2007‚Äì08 season.

They released two full-length records through Cogumelo Records in the 1980s. Biography Mutilator was formed in 1985 in Belo Horizonte by vocalist/guitarist Kleber, guitarist/lyricist Alexander \\"Magoo\\", bassist Ricardo Neves and his brother Rodrigo on drums, originally under the name of Desaster. The band changed their name to Mutilator following the addition of Sepultura roadie Silvio SDN on vocals. This line-up recorded the Bloodstorm and Grave Deseccration demos, and contributed two tracks (Believers of Hell and Nuclear Holocaust) to the Cogumelo Records' compilation Warfare Noise I in 1986. By 1987 Silvio SDN had left the band, and the band recorded their debut album for Cogumelo, Immortal Force with Kleber on vocals. The album was recorded on a tiny budget but has proved to have some long-lasting appeal; Eduardo Rivadavia of Allmusic describes it as \\"an excellent case study in DIY ethics and the desire to succeed against all odds\\" and comments, \\"when held up against its improbable origins, many of its deficiencies can't help but be ignored, and may well explain the album's enduring appeal in the eyes of serious metal collectors\\". Comparisons have been made between the album and the works of Sepultura, Sarc√≥fago, Vulcano, Kreator, Anthrax, Slayer, Metallica, Possessed and Bathory The album however had little international impact, and led only to limited national touring. Magoo however had faith in Mutilator's future potential and turned down an offer to replace Jairo T. in Sepultura (a position eventually taken by Andreas Kisser). A second album, Into the Strange was released in 1988 with a different line-up, following the departure of the Neves siblings. Magoo took over on vocals, also penning all of the lyrics and much of the music; the record also saw the arrival of new members CM (on guitars) and drummer Armando Sampaio (ex-Holocausto). Recorded and mixed in 16 tracks at Belo Horioznte's JG Studios, the album \\"held the distinction of being Brazilian heavy metal's most professional domestic production yet\\". However, the album fell well short of commercial expectations, and Mutilator split up shortly after its release. The band reunited briefly in 2001, but this reunion was cut short by the demise of Magoo in London, reportedly from a drug overdose.

In Plutarch's ‚ÄúLife of Sulla‚Äù, the hill is noted as having been the site of a monument to two townsmen of Chaeronea named Homoloichos and Anaxidamos, for their assistance to Sulla during the Battle of Chaeronea.

The monument was originally a memorial for General J. B. van Heutsz, who was the commandant of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army and is also known for conquering Aceh for the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1903 following the Aceh War. Because of political pressure the name was in 2004 changed to Monument Indi√´-Nederland. The origin After his death in 1924, a mausoleum was founded for Van Heutsz on the Nieuwe Oosterbegraafplaats. At the time the mausoleum was completed, there was still a bit of the collected money left. After the government agreed with the idea in 1930 to build a monument with this money in another part of Amsterdam, they started a contest. This contest was won by the architect and the sculptor Frits van Hall. Although there were strong protests of communists and social democrats, the monument was unveiled by Queen Wilhelmina, in the presence of princess Juliana and prime minister Colijn in 1935. The monument consists of a female character with a lion on each side. This was all surrounded by a pond and a stone wall. Symbolism Almost every part of the monument symbolizes the relations between the Netherlands and Indonesia. The female character in the center with the scroll of law in her hand, represents the Dutch authority in Indonesia. On each side of her is a lion, who both symbolize a city. One of them stands for Batavia, the old name of the capital of Nederlands-Indi√´, the other one stands for Amsterdam. In popular speech the woman is also called Mien met de hondjes ( Mien with the dogs in English) or de Nederlandse maagd (the Dutch virgin). On the pedestal used to be a portrait of the general van Heutsz, but because there was a lot of criticism about how van Heutsz had beaten down the riots in Atjeh, the portrait was removed and the name of the monument was changed from het van Heutsz monument to het monument Indi√´- Nederland. After the plaquette with the portrait had been removed, it was stolen in 1984. The pond symbolizes the water that separates the Netherlands and Indonesia. On the walls with the arcs on the left and on the right of the statue are placed reliefs that represent the islands of the archipelago. Attacks and protests Since 1935 the monument is frequently damaged. Already twice the monument has been the target of a bomb attack, in 1967 and in 1984. One remarkable fact is that van Heutsz Junior protested against the monument of his father in 1943 because in his opinion the monument was too weak. After the attack in 1984 and the theft of the portrait of van Heutsz the peace returned around the monument, until 1997, when the government wanted to renovate the monument. The protests came back on and the government decided to only sand blast the monument. Changes after the unveiling Since the monument was unveiled, a few changes have been made to it. In 2004 the proposal to contribute the monument to multatuli was rejected and it became a memorial that shows the relations between Indonesia and the Netherlands. That the monument became a memorial became clear in 2007 when a few changes were made: * Brick pedestals were added to the monument. The difference between the eastern (Indonesia) and the western (Netherlands) part of the monument were expressed by the different colors. * Six different dates were added to the monument: ::‚Äì 1596, the landing of Cornelis Houtman and Pieter Dirksz de Keyser on Bantam ::‚Äì 1945, declaration of freedom ::‚Äì 1949, recognition of independence by the Netherlands ::‚Äì 1935, the revealing of the statue ::‚Äì 2001, change of function and name ::‚Äì 2007, expansion of the monument  References  External links * Van Heutsz-monument at buitenbeeldinbeeld.nl Category:Buildings and structures in Amsterdam Category:Monuments and memorials in the Netherlands Category:Dutch East Indies ","title":"Monument Indi√´-Nederland"},{"id":"35456814","text":"Alankent (former Yakacƒ±k) is a town in Kabata≈ü district of Ordu Province, Turkey.

History Kuwait zoo was established in 1968.History of Kuwait zoo (Arabic) The zoo suffered extensive damages during the 1990 Iraqi Invasion. Nevertheless, most of the maintenance work has been finished, and the zoo reopened after the modification and renovation work was completed. Part of these renovations in early 1993 included the addition of new animals from other zoos. The zoo is around 180,000 m2 in area. It is divided into four major sections: * Animal Section * Cultural Center and Life Sciences Division * Services and Maintenance section * Veterinary clinic. Breeding and Over Population Kuwait Zoo does not use any device preventing fertilization or sterilization that regulates undesirable reproduction. Most cases, separating the animals in different cages are the only method zoo so far chosen to use as a preventive method to downgrade mating chances. Zoo faces harsh criticism since this old fashion in breeding system leads populace in zoo which force them to sell certain categories (mostly pony, deer, sheep and peacock) of animals for public. PETA criticism PETA Asia director, Jason Baker said that the living conditions of the Kuwait Zoo animals are atrocious and that they are continuously suffering a miserable life. In a letter addressed to the Director General of Kuwait Environment Public Authority, Baker urged the director to immediately ban the import of anymore animals to the zoo. According to the People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) activist, several animals at the Kuwait Zoo have died due to severe neglect on part of the employees as well as \\"...despicable husbandry conditions and the absence of veterinary care.\\" \\"The situation has been exacerbated by the recent heat waves in the country. Without adequate shelter and water, numerous animals have died of dehydration and heatstroke after prolonged exposure to extreme heat. News reports indicate that animals such as parrots, dogs and deer were lying dead at the zoo,\\" he said. Baker added that the zoo workers had no skills or knowledge when it came to providing proper treatment to injured and sick animals. He respectfully urged the Environment Public Authority to immediately ban any further import of animals and to take measures to improve the animal welfare at the zoo. The PETA director also mentioned that Kuwait ratified the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora in 2002 and various animals that have died were protected under the convention. He implored the authority to observe the treaty obligations and investigate the managerial activities of the Kuwait Zoo as well as to prohibit anyone from trading animals in violation of the convention. Director of Kuwait Zoo has refuted the assertions made by PETA Asia Director, Jason Baker saying that The Board of Director believes that Mr. Baker‚Äôs opinions and concerns only through a piece of article published a month ago that is full of unsubstantiated remarks. (The article was written by Mr. Fahed Al-Mayah of Al- Rai - Kuwait Newspaper) The Director said that the way the artifact was inscribed in an unethical and predisposed way. In the article, the writer claimed that \\"...there isn‚Äôt any air conditioning in the indoor animal enclosures and that they are dying due to the summer power cuts, which is untrue.\\" Transfer of Zoo The idea of transferring the Zoo to an alternate place in Al-Mutlaa area is considering but sources revealed that the Council has yet to discuss the situation of the Zoo, although members have presented proposals supporting the idea.

It is the only perennial river in the arid and semi- arid lands of the Baringo County. The Perkerra river supplies water to the Perkerra Irrigation Scheme in the Jemps flats near Marigat Township, just south of the lake. Catchment The river has a catchment area of . It rises in the Mau Forest on the western wall of the Rift valley at , dropping down to at its mouth on the lake. The catchment area has steep slopes on the hillsides, flattening out lower down. Most of the water comes from the hill slopes, where annual rainfall is from to . The region around the lake is semi- arid, with annual rainfall of and annual evaporation rates of to . Land use changes In the late 1800s the alluvial plains near the lake were occupied by the Njemps people, an ethnic group related to the Maasai. They used a brushwood barrier to raise the level of the river and let the water flow over the flat ground. The barrier would be destroyed by the seasonal floods, needing to be replaced, but the system was stable. The British explorer Joseph Thomson visited the Perkerra in the nineteenth century with his caravan and bought grain from the local people, grown using their proven system of irrigation using basins and canals. With the advent of Europeans in the area, both human and livestock populations increased. The high grass of the catchment was grazed down, erosion increased and run-off rates also increased, causing periodic floods. The brushwood barrier system could not deal with the floods and the Njemps turned to pastoralism. Severe overgrazing, drought and locust invasions led to a food crisis in the late 1920s. In the 1930s the colonial administration began considering the possibility of irrigation, and a formal study was made in 1936, although nothing was done for some years. Perkerra irrigation scheme The Perkerra irrigation scheme was launched in 1952 during the Emergency. Construction began in 1954.> Detainees made the roads and prepared the land for irrigation. The project was rushed, expensive to implement and maintain, with little in return. There were difficulties raising crops and difficulty selling them. Many of the tenant farmers who were settled on the project later left. By 1959 it was decided to close the scheme, which had only 100 families, but this was changed to continuing minimal operations. In 1962 the scheme was expanded, and by 1967 there were 500 farming houses, although subsidies were still needed. The Perkerra irrigation scheme now supports about 670 farm households. Total potential irrigation area is but only has been developed for gravity furrow irrigation and of that is being cropped due to a shortage of water. In the past the main crops were onions, chilies, watermelons, pawpaws and cotton. Maize was introduced in 1996 and has proved easier to market. The Kenya Agricultural Research Institute has a research center in Marigat Township that complements the irrigation scheme. Issues and actions There is now scarcely any vegetation in the lowlands for eight or nine months of the year apart from swamps in the lower reaches of the Molo and Perkerra rivers and along the lakeshore around their mouths. The swamps, mostly covered by perennial grasses and flooded for only two months of the year, provide grazing for herders. The herders originally had more land, but some has been lost to farmers who immigrated to the area, and some to the irrigation scheme. The herders claim that the irrigation dams have reduced the level of annual floods and thus cut down the amount of pasture. With little plant cover on most of the lower levels, the soil erodes easily and much sediment is deposited in Lake Baringo. Between 1972 and 2003 the depth of the lake has fallen from to . The lake has contracted from in 1960 to in 2001. It is becoming saline, and fish stocks are declining. A 2010 study indicated that the river was becoming seasonal. The study recommended implementing a mandatory reserve, or environmental flow. It was thought that the Chemususu dam project on one of the main tributaries of the Perkerra, due to be commissioned in 2011, would mitigate the effect of the reserve on water users while ensuring that the river did not dry up altogether. The dam would hold and will provide daily, enough for 200,000 people. River Water User Associations in the upper regions of the Perkerra and Molo rivers have been planting tree seedlings, protecting the river banks and rehabilitating areas that have become degraded through sand harvesting and quarrying. The Perkerra RWUA has also been protecting springs, a particular concern since 30 out of 72 springs in the area have ceased to flow.

Life The son of Timothy and Hannah Bevan, he was born in London on 18 February 1753. His father gave him a share in his business of a chemist and druggist in Plough Court, Lombard Street. In 1784 his mother died. He retired from trade in 1794 with a loss of capital, having refused, from conscientious reasons, to supply armed vessels with drugs. He filled for many years the station of a Quaker elder. In 1796 he moved to Stoke Newington. On a visit to friends in Scotland, in 1808, Bevan began to suffer from cataract in his left eye, and two years later he was attacked by paralysis in his left side. His wife became unable to recognise her own husband. She died in 1813. Bevan at the end of his life had read to him selections from John Kendall's Collection of Letters, Thomas Ellwood's Journal, and Mary Waring's Diary; and spent most of his time in Tottenham with family connections. On 12 September 1814 Bevan died, and was buried at the Quaker Burying Ground, Bunhill Fields. Reputation William Thomas Lowndes said that Bevan was the ablest of the Quaker apologists. William Orme found the Life of Paul insightful by the way of explanation of Quaker theology; and Thomas Hartwell Horne admired the geographical notes. Works It was in 1794 that Bevan began writing verse for an almanac published by James Phillips. He wrote biographical material on the Quaker figures Robert Barclay, James Nayler, Isaac Penington, and Sarah Stephenson. His major works are: * A Refutation of some of the more modern Misrepresentations of the Society of Friends, commonly called Quakers, with a life of James Nayler; also a Summary of the History, Doctrine, and Discipline of Friends, 1800. This work addressed the writings of Mosheim, Formey, David Hume, and the editors of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, who quoted from Charles Leslie and John Wesley. * An Examination of the First Part of a Pamphlet, called An Appeal to the Society of Friends, 1802. A reply to Thomas Foster, its intention was to show that early Quakers were not Unitarians. * A Short Account of the Life and Writings of Robert Barclay, 1802. * Thoughts on Reason and Revelation, particularly the Revelation of the Scriptures, 1805, 1828, 1853. This is a short work divided into sections on: reason, revelation in general, infidelity, scripture, faith, and experience. * Memoirs of the Life of Isaac Penington, to which is added a Review of his Writings, 1807. * Memoirs of the Life and Travels in the service of the Gospel of Sarah Stephenson, chiefly from her own papers, 1807. * The Life of the Apostle Paul as related in Scripture, but in which his epistles are inserted in that part of the history to which they are supposed respectively to belong; with select notes, critical, explanatory, and relating to persons and places, 1807, and corrected and enlarged 1811 . * A Reply to so much of a Sermon published in the course of last year by Philip Dodd as relates to the well-known scruple of the Society of Friends, commonly called Quakers, against all Swearing, 1808. Against Philip Stanhope Dodd. * Piety promoted in brief memorials and dying expressions of some of the Society of Friends, commonly called Quakers; the tenth part, to which is prefixed an historical account of the precedmg parts of volumes, and of their several compilers and editors, 2nd edition, 1811.

It has rough, fibrous, dark brown to black bark on the base of the trunk and smooth greyish, greenish or coppery bark on the upper trunk and branches. Leaves on young plants and on coppice regrowth are arranged alternately, egg-shaped, long, wide and have a petiole. The adult leaves are arranged alternately, broadly lance-shaped to egg-shaped, long, wide on a petiole long, and the same glossy green on both sides. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven, mostly on the ends of the branches on a peduncle long, the individual flowers usually sessile. Mature buds are oblong to oval, green to brownish, long and wide with a conical to rounded operculum. Flowering mainly occurs from September to February and the flowers are white. The fruit that follows is a woody, cup-shaped or barrel- shaped capsule long and in diameter. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus behriana was first formally described by Victorian Government Botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in 1855 and the description was published in Transactions and Proceedings of the Victorian Institute for the Advancement of Science. The specific epithet (behriana) honours Hans Hermann Behr. Distribution Eucalyptus behriana has a disjunct distribution in south- eastern Australia. In New South Wales it occurs in mallee shrubland near West Wyalong. In Victoria it occurs in the Mallee and Wimmera in the north-west, with the exception of a small outlying population in the south near Bacchus Marsh including Long Forest Nature Conservation Reserve. In South Australia, it has a scattered distribution across the south-east.

In an abstract argumentation framework,See Dung (1995) entry-level information is a set of abstract arguments that, for instance, represent data or a proposition. Conflicts between arguments are represented by a binary relation on the set of arguments. In concrete terms, you represent an argumentation framework with a directed graph such that the nodes are the arguments, and the arrows represent the attack relation. There exist some extensions of the Dung's framework, like the logic-based argumentation frameworksSee Besnard and Hunter (2001) or the value-based argumentation frameworks.see Bench-Capon (2002)  Abstract argumentation frameworks  = Formal framework = Abstract argumentation frameworks, also called argumentation frameworks √† la Dung, are defined formally as a pair: * A set of abstract elements called arguments, denoted A * A binary relation on A, called attack relation, denoted R The graph built from the system S. For instance, the argumentation system S = \\\\langle A, R \\\\rangle with A = \\\\\\\\{ a, b, c, d\\\\\\\\} and R = \\\\\\\\{(a,b), (b,c), (d,c) \\\\\\\\} contains four arguments (a, b, c and d) and three attacks (a attacks b, b attacks c and d attacks c). Dung defines some notions : * an argument a \\\\in A is acceptable with respect to E \\\\subseteq A if and only if E defends a, that is \\\\forall b \\\\in A such that (b,a) \\\\in R, \\\\exists c \\\\in E such that (c,b) \\\\in R, * a set of arguments E is conflict-free if there is no attack between its arguments, formally : \\\\forall a, b \\\\in E, (a,b) ot\\\\in R, * a set of arguments E is admissible if and only if it is conflict-free and all its arguments are acceptable with respect to E. = Different semantics of acceptance =  Extensions  To decide if an argument can be accepted or not, or if several arguments can be accepted together, Dung defines several semantics of acceptance that allows, given an argumentation system, sets of arguments (called extensions) to be computed. For instance, given S = \\\\langle A, R\\\\rangle, * E is a complete extension of S only if it is an admissible set and every acceptable argument with respect to E belongs to E, * E is a preferred extension of S only if it is a maximal element (with respect to the set- theoretical inclusion) among the admissible sets with respect to S, * E is a stable extension of S only if it is a conflict-free set that attacks every argument that does not belong in E (formally, \\\\forall a \\\\in A \\\\backslash E, \\\\exists b \\\\in E such that (b,a) \\\\in R, * E is the (unique) grounded extension of S only if it is the smallest element (with respect to set inclusion) among the complete extensions of S. There exists some inclusions between the sets of extensions built with these semantics : * Every stable extension is preferred, * Every preferred extension is complete, * The grounded extension is complete, * If the system is well-founded (there exists no infinite sequence a_0,a_1,\\\\dots,a_n,\\\\dots such that \\\\forall i>0, (a_{i+1},a_{i}) \\\\in R), all these semantics coincide‚Äîonly one extension is grounded, stable, preferred, and complete. Some other semantics have been defined.For instance, * Ideal : see Dung, Mancarella and Toni (2006) * Eager : see Caminada (2007) One introduce the notation Ext_\\\\sigma(S) to note the set of \\\\sigma-extensions of the system S. In the case of the system S in the figure above, Ext_\\\\sigma(S) = \\\\\\\\{\\\\\\\\{a,d\\\\\\\\}\\\\\\\\} for every Dung's semantic‚Äîthe system is well-founded. That explains why the semantics coincide, and the accepted arguments are: a and d.  Labellings  Labellings are a more expressive way than extensions to express the acceptance of the arguments. Concretely, a labelling is a mapping that associates every argument with a label in (the argument is accepted), out (the argument is rejected), or undec (the argument is undefined‚Äînot accepted or refused). One can also note a labelling as a set of pairs (\\\\mathit{argument}, \\\\mathit{label}). Such a mapping does not make sense without additional constraint. The notion of reinstatement labelling guarantees the sense of the mapping. L is a reinstatement labelling on the system S = \\\\langle A, R \\\\rangle if and only if : * \\\\forall a \\\\in A, L(a) = \\\\mathit{in} if and only if \\\\forall b \\\\in A such that (b,a) \\\\in R, L(b) = \\\\mathit{out} * \\\\forall a \\\\in A, L(a) = \\\\mathit{out} if and only if \\\\exists b \\\\in A such that (b,a) \\\\in R and L(b) = \\\\mathit{in} * \\\\forall a \\\\in A, L(a) = \\\\mathit{undec} if and only if L(a) eq \\\\mathit{in} and L(a) eq \\\\mathit{out} One can convert every extension into a reinstatement labelling: the arguments of the extension are in, those attacked by an argument of the extension are out, and the others are undec. Conversely, one can build an extension from a reinstatement labelling just by keeping the arguments in. Indeed, Caminadasee Caminada (2006) proved that the reinstatement labellings and the complete extensions can be mapped in a bijective way. Moreover, the other Datung's semantics can be associated to some particular sets of reinstatement labellings. Reinstatement labellings distinguish arguments not accepted because they are attacked by accepted arguments from undefined arguments‚Äîthat is, those that are not defended cannot defend themselves. An argument is undec if it is attacked by at least another undec. If it is attacked only by arguments out, it must be in, and if it is attacked some argument in, then it is out. The unique reinstatement labelling that corresponds to the system S above is L = \\\\\\\\{(a,\\\\mathit{in}),(b,\\\\mathit{out}),(c,\\\\mathit{out}),(d,\\\\mathit{in})\\\\\\\\}. = Inference from an argumentation system = In the general case when several extensions are computed for a given semantic \\\\sigma, the agent that reasons from the system can use several mechanisms to infer information:see Touretzky et al. * Credulous inference: the agent accepts an argument if it belongs to at least one of the \\\\sigma-extensions‚Äîin which case, the agent risks accepting some arguments that are not acceptable together (a attacks b, and a and b each belongs to an extension) * Skeptical inference: the agent accepts an argument only if it belongs to every \\\\sigma-extension. In this case, the agent risks deducing too little information (if the intersection of the extensions is empty or has a very small cardinal). For these two methods to infer information, one can identify the set of accepted arguments, respectively Cr_\\\\sigma(S) the set of the arguments credulously accepted under the semantic \\\\sigma, and Sc_\\\\sigma(S) the set of arguments accepted skeptically under the semantic \\\\sigma (the \\\\sigma can be missed if there is no possible ambiguity about the semantic). Of course, when there is only one extension (for instance, when the system is well-founded), this problem is very simple: the agent accepts arguments of the unique extension and rejects others. The same reasoning can be done with labellings that correspond to the chosen semantic : an argument can be accepted if it is in for each labelling and refused if it is out for each labelling, the others being in an undecided state (the status of the arguments can remind the epistemic states of a belief in the AGM framework for dynamic of beliefssee G√§rdenfors (1988)). = Equivalence between argumentation frameworks = There exists several criteria of equivalence between argumentation frameworks. Most of those criteria concern the sets of extensions or the set of accepted arguments. Formally, given a semantic \\\\sigma : * \\\\mathit{EQ_1} : two argumentation frameworks are equivalent if they have the same set of \\\\sigma-extensions, that is S_1 \\\\equiv_1 S_2 \\\\Leftrightarrow Ext_\\\\sigma(S_1) = Ext_\\\\sigma(S_2) ; * \\\\mathit{EQ_2} : two argumentation frameworks are equivalent if they accept skeptically the same arguments, that is S_1 \\\\equiv_2 S_2 \\\\Leftrightarrow Sc_\\\\sigma(S_1) = Sc_\\\\sigma(S_2) ; * \\\\mathit{EQ_2} : two argumentation frameworks are equivalent if they accept credulously the same arguments, that is S_1 \\\\equiv_3 S_2 \\\\Leftrightarrow Cr_\\\\sigma(S_1) = Cr_\\\\sigma(S_2). The strong equivalencesee Oikarinen and Woltran (2001) says that two systems S_1 and S_2 are equivalent if and only if for all other system S_3, the union of S_1 with S_3 is equivalent (for a given criterion) with the union of S_2 and S_3.the union of two systems represents here the system built from the union of the sets of arguments and the union of the attack relations  Other kinds  The abstract framework of Dung has been instantiated to several particular cases. = Logic-based argumentation frameworks = In the case of logic-based argumentation frameworks, an argument is not an abstract entity, but a pair, where the first part is a minimal consistent set of formulae enough to prove the formula for the second part of the argument. Formally, an argument is a pair (\\\\Phi,\\\\alpha) such that * \\\\Phi vdash \\\\bot * \\\\Phi \\\\vdash \\\\alpha * \\\\Phi is a minimal set of \\\\Delta satisfying \\\\alpha where \\\\Delta is a set of formulae used by the agent to reason. One calls \\\\alpha a consequence of \\\\Phi, and \\\\Phi a support of \\\\alpha. In this case, the attack relation is not given in an explicit way, as a subset of the Cartesian product A \\\\times A, but as a property that indicates if an argument attacks another. For instance, * Relation defeater : (\\\\Psi,\\\\beta) attacks (\\\\Phi,\\\\alpha) if and only if \\\\beta \\\\vdash eg (\\\\phi_1 \\\\wedge \\\\dots \\\\wedge \\\\phi_n) for \\\\\\\\{\\\\phi_1,\\\\dots,\\\\phi_n\\\\\\\\} \\\\subseteq \\\\Phi * Relation undercut : (\\\\Psi,\\\\beta) attacks (\\\\Phi,\\\\alpha) if and only if \\\\beta = eg (\\\\phi_1 \\\\wedge \\\\dots \\\\wedge \\\\phi_n) for \\\\\\\\{\\\\phi_1,\\\\dots,\\\\phi_n\\\\\\\\} \\\\subseteq \\\\Phi * Relation rebuttal : (\\\\Psi,\\\\beta) attacks (\\\\Phi,\\\\alpha) if and only if \\\\beta \\\\Leftrightarrow eg \\\\alpha is a tautology Given a particular attack relation, one can build a graph and reason in a similar way to the abstract argumentation frameworks (use of semantics to build extension, skeptical or credulous inference), the difference is that the information inferred from a logic based argumentation framework is a set of formulae (the consequences of the accepted arguments). = Value-based argumentation frameworks = The value-based argumentation frameworks come from the idea that during an exchange of arguments, some can be stronger than others with respect to a certain value they advance, and so the success of an attack between arguments depends of the difference of these values. Formally, a value-based argumentation framework is a tuple VAF = \\\\langle A, R, V, \\\\textit{val}, \\\\textit{valprefs} \\\\rangle with A and R similar to the standard framework (a set of arguments and a binary relation on this set), V is a non empty set of values, \\\\textit{val} is a mapping that associates each element from A to an element from V, and \\\\textit{valprefs} is a preference relation (transitive, irreflexive and asymmetric) on V \\\\times V. In this framework, an argument a defeats another argument b if and only if * a attacks b in the \\"standard\\" meaning: (a,b) \\\\in R ; * and (\\\\textit{val}(b),val(a)) ot\\\\in \\\\textit{valprefs}, that is the value advanced by b is not preferred to the one advanced by a. One remarks that an attack succeeds if both arguments are associated to the same value, or if there is no preference between their respective values. = Assumption-based argumentation frameworks = In assumption-based argumentation (ABA) frameworks, arguments are defined as a set of rules and attacks are defined in terms of assumptions and contraries. Formally, an assumption-based argumentation framework is a tuple \\\\langle \\\\mathcal{L}, \\\\mathcal{R}, \\\\mathcal{A}, \\\\overline{\\\\textvisiblespace} \\\\rangle, where * \\\\langle \\\\mathcal{L}, \\\\mathcal{R} \\\\rangle is a deductive system, where \\\\mathcal{L} is the language and \\\\mathcal{R} is the set of inference rules in the form of s_0\\\\leftarrow s_1, \\\\dotsc, s_m, for m > 0 and s_0, s_1, \\\\dotsc, s_m \\\\in \\\\mathcal{L}; * \\\\mathcal{A}, where \\\\mathcal{A}\\\\subseteq\\\\mathcal{L} is a non-empty set, named the assumptions; * \\\\overline{\\\\textvisiblespace} is a total mapping from \\\\mathcal{A} to \\\\mathcal{L}, where \\\\overline{a} is defined as the contrary of a. As a consequence of defining an ABA, an argument can be represented in a tree-form. Formally, given a deductive system \\\\langle \\\\mathcal{L}, \\\\mathcal{R} \\\\rangle and set of assumptions \\\\mathcal{A}\\\\subseteq\\\\mathcal{L}, an argument for claim c\\\\in{\\\\mathcal{L}} supported by S\\\\subseteq\\\\mathcal{A}, is a tree with nodes labelled by sentences in \\\\mathcal{L} or by symbol \\\\tau, such that: * The root is labelled by c * For each node N, ** If N is a leaf node, then N is labelled by either an assumption or by \\\\tau ** If N is not a leaf node, then there is an inference rule l_N\\\\leftarrow s_1, ... , s_m, (m \\\\geq 0), where l_Nis the label of N and *** If m = 0, then the rule shall be l_N\\\\leftarrow \\\\tau (i.e. child of N is \\\\tau) *** Otherwise, N has m children, labelled by s_1, ... , s_m * S is the set of all assumptions labeling the leave nodes An argument with claim c supported by a set of assumption S can also be denoted as S\\\\vdash c  See also  * Argument map * Argumentation theory * Defeater * Diagrammatic reasoning * Dialogical logic * Logic and dialectic * Logic of argumentation * Knowledge representation and reasoning * Probabilistic argumentation  Notes  References    Category:Artificial intelligence ","title":"Argumentation framework"},{"id":"35457085","text":"The Swedish ethyl acetate method (SweEt) is a method for chemical analysis of pesticide residues in food using ethyl acetate as an extraction medium followed by analysis with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC- MS/MS) and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS).

He was elected as a member of the French Academy of Sciences on November 30, 2010.  Research  Choquet is a biologist, focusing on nanoscopic imaging and the organization of receptors in neurons. His early research included work on the properties of ion channels of B lymphocytes. This research work earned him the CNRS Bronze medal in 1990. During his post-doc at Duke, he discovered that cells can respond and adapt to the mechanical properties of their environment. Since 1996, he has researched the fundamental properties of the transmission of nerve impulses in the brain and developed new nanoscale imaging techniques. He discovered that receptors move in living neurons and that these movements in and out synapses participate to synaptic plasticity, a phenomenon thought to underlie learning and memory. Choquet's current work involves attempting to understand the role of receptor movements in neurodegenerative diseases. His recent research work has earned him the 2004 CEA Prize and the 2009 CNRS Silver medal.text presented on Daniel Choquet at the awarding of the [silver medal http://www.cnrs.fr/fr/recherche/prix/docs/argent2009/ChoquetD.pdf ]  Awards  * 1990: CNRS Bronze medal * 1994: Petit-Dormoy prize of the Acad√©mie des Sciences * 1994: Prize of the \\"soci√©t√© de secours des amis de la science\\" * 1997: Research prize form the Fondation pour la Recherche M√©dicale * 2004: Grand prix de l'Acad√©mie des Sciences, prize of the CEA * 2006: Labeled FRM team by the \\"Fondation pour la Recherche M√©dicale\\" * 2007: Laureate of the \\"Bauer Lectureship award\\", Brandeis University * 2008: Laureate of an \\"ERC advanced research grant\\" from the European Commission * 2009: Nominated author of the year 2008 by the French Society for Neurosciences * 2009: CNRS Silver medal * 2010: Elected member of the French Academy of Sciences, integrative biology section * 2011: Laureate of the \\"Victoires de la m√©decine 2011\\" * 2012: Nominated \\"Chevalier de l'ordre des Palmes acad√©miques\\" * 2014: Elected member of EMBO  References  External links * Biosketch en anglais * presentation on the web site of the Bordeaux Neuroscience Federation * presentation at the Academy * web site of the Interdisciplinary Institute for Neuroscience * web site of the Bordeaux Imaging Center Category:1962 births Category:French neuroscientists Category:Living people Category:Members of the French Academy of Sciences Category:Pierre and Marie Curie University alumni ","title":"Daniel Choquet"},{"id":"35457105","text":"The Gassmann equation, first described by Fritz Gassmann, is used in geophysics and its relations are receiving more attention as seismic data are increasingly used for reservoir monitoring. The Gassmann equation is the most common way of performing a fluid substitution model from one known parameter. Procedure These formulations are from Avseth et al. (2006).Avseth, P, T Mukerji & G Mavko (2006), Quantitative seismic interpretation, Cambridge University Press, 2006. Given an initial set of velocities and densities, V_{P}^{(1)}, V_{S}^{(1)}, and \\\\rho ^{(1)} corresponding to a rock with an initial set of fluids, you can compute the velocities and densities of the rock with another set of fluid. Often these velocities are measured from well logs, but might also come from a theoretical model. Step 1: Extract the dynamic bulk and shear moduli from V_\\\\mathrm{P}^{(1)}, V_\\\\mathrm{S}^{(1)}, and \\\\rho ^{(1)}: :K_\\\\mathrm{sat}^{(1)} = \\\\rho \\\\left ((V_\\\\mathrm{P}^{(1)})^{2}-\\\\frac{4}{3}(V_\\\\mathrm{S}^{(1)})^{2} \\\\right) :\\\\mu_\\\\mathrm{sat}^{(1)} = \\\\rho (V_\\\\mathrm{S}^{(1)})^{2} Step 2: Apply Gassmann's relation, of the following form, to transform the saturated bulk modulus: :\\\\frac{K_\\\\mathrm{sat}^{(2)}}{K_\\\\mathrm{mineral}-K_\\\\mathrm{sat}^{(2)}}-\\\\frac{K_\\\\mathrm{fluid}^{(2)}}{\\\\phi (K_\\\\mathrm{mineral}-K_\\\\mathrm{fluid}^{(2)})}=\\\\frac{K_\\\\mathrm{sat}^{(1)}}{K_\\\\mathrm{mineral}-K_\\\\mathrm{sat}^{(1)}}-\\\\frac{K_\\\\mathrm{fluid}^{(1)}}{\\\\phi (K_\\\\mathrm{mineral}-K_\\\\mathrm{fluid}^{(1)})} where K_\\\\mathrm{sat}^{(1)} and K_\\\\mathrm{sat}^{(2)} are the rock bulk moduli saturated with fluid 1 and fluid 2, and K_\\\\mathrm{fluid}^{(1)} and K_\\\\mathrm{fluid}^{(2)} are the bulk moduli of the fluids themselves. Step 3: Leave the shear modulus unchanged (rigidity is independent of fluid type): :\\\\mu_\\\\mathrm{sat}^{(2)}=\\\\mu_\\\\mathrm{sat}^{(1)} Step 4: Correct the bulk density for the change in fluid: : \\\\rho^{(2)}= \\\\rho^{(1)}+\\\\phi (\\\\rho_\\\\mathrm{fluid}^{(2)} -\\\\rho_\\\\mathrm{fluid}^{(1)}) Step 5: recompute the fluid substituted velocities :V_\\\\mathrm{P}^{(2)}=\\\\sqrt \\\\frac{K_\\\\mathrm{sat}^{(2)}+\\\\frac{4}{3} \\\\mu_\\\\mathrm{sat}^{(2)}}{\\\\rho^{(2)}} :V_\\\\mathrm{S}^{(2)} = \\\\sqrt \\\\frac{\\\\mu_\\\\mathrm{sat}^{(2)}}{\\\\rho^{(2)}} Rearranging for Ksat Given :\\\\frac{K_\\\\mathrm{sat}^{(2)}}{K_\\\\mathrm{mineral}-K_\\\\mathrm{sat}^{(2)}}-\\\\frac{K_\\\\mathrm{fluid}^{(2)}}{\\\\phi (K_\\\\mathrm{mineral}-K_\\\\mathrm{fluid}^{(2)})}=\\\\frac{K_\\\\mathrm{sat}^{(1)}}{K_\\\\mathrm{mineral}-K_\\\\mathrm{sat}^{(1)}}-\\\\frac{K_\\\\mathrm{fluid}^{(1)}}{\\\\phi (K_\\\\mathrm{mineral}-K_\\\\mathrm{fluid}^{(1)})} Let : S = \\\\frac{K_\\\\mathrm{sat}^{(1)}}{K_\\\\mathrm{mineral}-K_\\\\mathrm{sat}^{(1)}} and : F_1 = \\\\frac{K_\\\\mathrm{fluid}^{(1)}}{\\\\phi (K_\\\\mathrm{mineral}-K_\\\\mathrm{fluid}^{(1)})}\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ F_2 = \\\\frac{K_\\\\mathrm{fluid}^{(2)}}{\\\\phi (K_\\\\mathrm{mineral}-K_\\\\mathrm{fluid}^{(2)})} then : K_\\\\mathrm{sat}^{(2)} = \\\\frac{K_\\\\mathrm{mineral}}{\\\\frac{1}{S-F_1+F_2} + 1} Or, expanded : K_\\\\mathrm{sat}^{(2)} = \\\\frac{K_\\\\mathrm{mineral}}{ \\\\left[ {\\\\frac{K_\\\\mathrm{sat}^{(1)}}{K_\\\\mathrm{mineral}-K_\\\\mathrm{sat}^{(1)}}-\\\\frac{K_\\\\mathrm{fluid}^{(1)}}{\\\\phi (K_\\\\mathrm{mineral}-K_\\\\mathrm{fluid}^{(1)})}+\\\\frac{K_\\\\mathrm{fluid}^{(2)}}{\\\\phi (K_\\\\mathrm{mineral}-K_\\\\mathrm{fluid}^{(2)})}} \\\\right]^{-1} + 1} Assumptions =Load induced pore pressure is homogeneous and identical in all pores= This assumption imply that shear modulus of the saturated rock is the same as the shear modulus of the dry rock,Berryman, J (2009), Origins of Gassmann's equations, 2009, Geophysics. \\\\mu_\\\\mathrm{sat}= \\\\mu_\\\\mathrm{dry}. =Porosity does not change with different saturating fluids= Gassmann fluid substitution requires that the porosity remain constant. The assumption being that, all other things being equal, different saturating fluids should not affect the porosity of the rock. This does not take into account diagenetic processes, such as cementation or dissolution, that vary with changing geochemical conditions in the pores. For example, quartz cement is more likely to precipitate in water-filled pores than it is in hydrocarbon-filled ones (Worden and Morad, 2000). So the same rock may have different porosity in different locations due to the local water saturation. =Frequency effects are negligible in the measurements= Gassmann's equations are essentially the lower frequency limit of Biot's more general equations of motion for poroelastic materials. At seismic frequencies (10‚Äì100 Hz), the error in using Gassmann's equation may be negligible. However, when constraining the necessary parameters with sonic measurements at logging frequencies (~20 kHz), this assumption may be violated. A better option, yet more computationally intense, would be to use Biot's frequency-dependent equation to calculate the fluid substitution effects. If the output from this process will be integrated with seismic data, the obtained elastic parameters must also be corrected for dispersion effects. =Rock frame is not altered by the saturating fluid= Gassmann's equations assumes no chemical interactions between the fluids and the solids.

In the ads, Peggy is a bearded man with an Eastern European accent and a moth-eaten sweater. Peggy answers the phone for \\"USA Prime Credit,\\" for whom he gives evasive or unhelpful customer service. He works in an unspecified frozen location, and his call center is a jumble of rubbish, outdated electronics, and stray personal effects. The character of Peggy was created by the Martin Agency of Richmond, Virginia. He is played by actor Tudor Petrut, who was born in Romania and uses his native accent in portraying the character. On the agency's site, Peggy has given personal acknowledgments to several fans, up to and including voicing one fan's proposal to his girlfriend. The page's owners stopped maintaining the page in April 2013, having discontinued the character. Appearances Peggy appears in 13 commercials, listed here: * Transfer - Peggy is called by actress Lilli Birdsell, who asks for a supervisor after stating she's called three times. Peggy responds by saying, \\"Supervisor is genius, I transfer,\\" then passes the phone between his coworkers, who all shout \\"Transfer\\" as they receive it and pass it to one another. When Peggy gets the phone back, Lilli yells in frustration, \\"Come on!\\" before weeping with her elbows on a concrete wall. * Rewards That Make Sense - This woman calls Peggy to cash in reward points. \\"No more points, coupons now,\\" Peggy responds, after which he tells her to convert coupons to tokens, which she then trades for credits. She interrupts him by saying, \\"And then I get the cash,\\" but he tells her, \\"Then you call back,\\" before hanging up the phone. Confused, the woman asks, \\"What just happened?\\" * What Kind Of Program Is This? - This woman calls Peggy to redeem reward points towards a gift card. When she states she has 250,000 points, Peggy fiddles with an adding machine, before giving her answer, which turns out to be $5.50. He then takes back what's known as a \\"redemption charge,\\" which leaves the woman with $0.50. \\"Happy time,\\" Peggy says as another worker dings a small gong. Confused, the woman asks, \\"What kind of program is this?\\" * How About Cash? - This man calls Peggy to ask about reward options for 100,000 points. Peggy responds by saying, \\"Many options; 1) keychain, B) trucker cap--look good for ladies.\\" When the man asks about cash, Peggy responds by yelling to his coworkers, \\"He wants cash!\\" All the coworkers laugh, and the man becomes confused. * Herb Street: What Number? - ESPN's College Gameday analyst Kirk Herbstreit calls Peggy to cancel his USA Prime Credit card. When Peggy responds, \\"You make Peggy sad,\\" Kirk explains the benefits of Discover Card. including cash rewards and being accepted in more places. When Kirk says his name, Peggy responds by asking for a number on \\"Herb Street.\\" Kirk declines the question, saying \\"Herbstreit is my last name,\\" before again denying a number on \\"Herb Street.\\" The commercial ends with Peggy asking again and Kirk taking a deep breath to try not to lose his temper. * Patrick Kane - \\"The hotel says my card is maxed out--it can't be,\\" NHL ice hockey player Patrick Kane says when he calls Peggy to complain. When he states his name, Peggy asks him how he scored from the left side. As Patrick tells him, Peggy says, \\"Hold please,\\" before playing at a hockey table. A buzzer sounds, and Peggy pretends he's in a crowd of thousands of people congratulating him for a victory. \\"Peggy, I can hear you,\\" says Patrick. * Boston Cab - NHL ice hockey goalie Tim Thomas calls Peggy to complain. \\"Yes, it's a common problem,\\" Peggy responds, to which Tim states he's in a Boston cab. \\"Just place card carefully in envelope and send to Peggy,\\" says Peggy, \\"We fix. Three weeks.\\" Tim asks for help, but Peggy says again, \\"Three weeks.\\" When Tim tells his name to the cab driver, she denies it, and pulls down her ceiling visor showing a picture of another so- called \\"Tim Thomas\\" wearing a helmet. The commercial ends with Tim repeatedly whispering \\"Peggy\\" as he ducks his head in the backseat. * Annual Fee - This man calls Peggy to complain about a $35 annual fee. When Peggy says \\"Yes,\\" the man asks if it's a mistake. When Peggy says \\"Yes\\" again, the man asks if Peggy is saying the word or asking it like a question. When Peggy says \\"Yes\\" once more, the man tries to get Peggy to answer the questions about the fee. Soon Peggy hangs up on him. * Please Hold - Peggy says a few words to his coworkers in some foreign language, before answering the phone with a man who states he's been waiting for a representative to answer the phone for 15 minutes. \\"You're tenacious like a bull, I like,\\" says Peggy, \\"Please hold!\\" The man yells \\"No no no no no, Pegg...\\" Peggy admires the blinking lights on his telephones, as the man listens to the Red Army Choir hold music. * Dad Gum - Florida State Seminoles football team coach Bobby Bowden calls Peggy to complain about charges for a pet shop. When asked if \\"that sounds like a man who'd have five dad gum charges,\\" Peggy fakes a static noise by wiggling a crushed piece of paper to the phone's microphone, and says, \\"You break up, call back next week!\\" When Peggy hangs up, Bobby says, \\"I'm not too old to find you, son.\\" * Retraining Program - This man calls Peggy to cancel his USA Prime Credit Card, He explains the benefits of Discover Card, including cash rewards and being accepted in more places. As an older woman with an eye patch approaches with a puppet holding a baseball bat, Peggy says, \\"If I lose a customer, I must take a retraining program,\\" to which the man replies, \\"Come on, retraining can't be that bad.\\" When a whipping sound and Peggy screaming are heard on the phone, the man says, \\"Ooh, bad.\\" * Do You Believe In Yourself? - College football coach Lou Holtz calls Peggy to order a replacement card after losing his original one. \\"One month,\\" says Peggy. Lou says, \\"Do you believe in yourself? I believe in you too, Peggy. You could be my go-to guy. Or girl. Now stand tall and get out there and replace my card!\\" Peggy responds, \\"You inspire me. Three weeks!\\" The commercial ends with Lou saying, \\"Okay, let's start over.\\" * Stanley Cup Final - This man tries to take a plane to Chicago for the Stanley Cup Final. He calls Peggy to complain about a problem with his card. When he's told he didn't pay his bill, the man tells Peggy he did pay it a week prior to calling. Peggy says, \\"We must have computer problem, hold please,\\" before hanging up to play a game of chess. The commercial ends with the man deciding to take a bus.

The legend The legend takes place in the 8th century, during the wars between Christians and Muslims in the southwest of Europe. At the time, Carcassonne was under Saracen rule and Charlemagne's army was at the gates to reconquer the city for the Franks. A Saracen princess named Carcas ruled the Knights of the City after the death of her husband. The siege lasted for five years. Early in the sixth year, food and water were running out. Lady Carcas made an inventory of all remaining reserves. The villagers brought her a pig and a sack of wheat. She then had the idea to feed the wheat to the pig and then throw it from the highest tower of the city walls. Charlemagne lifted the siege, believing that the city had enough food to the point of wasting pigs fed with wheat. Overjoyed by the success of her plan, Lady Carcas decided to sound all the bells in the city. One of Charlemagne's men then exclaimed: \\"Carcas sonne!\\" (which means \\"Carcas sounds\\"). Hence the name of the city. Historicity Lady Carcas appears to be a fictional character. The legend dates back to oral traditions of the 12th century, was written down in the 16th century by Jean Dupre and rewritten in the 17th century by Guillaume Besse and Guillaume Catel. Charlemagne could not have besieged Carcassonne, as his father Pepin had already taken the city from the Saracens in 759 - Charlemagne would have then been 17. Similar legends link a number of historical characters in other times and places with similar ruses. One of the earliest was the 6th century BCE Greek Bias of Priene who successfully resisted the Lydian king Alyattes by fattening up a pair of mules and driving them out of the besieged city. When Alyattes' envoy was then sent to Priene, Bias had piles of sand covered with corn to give the impression of plentiful resources. Traces in the city The replica of lady Carcas's bust. * At the entrance of the drawbridge, a replica of Lady Carcas's bust welcomes visitors.

The two towns have since been fused. History Opened on , the Hartlepool system initially replaced the West Hartlepool portion of the Hartlepool Electric Tramways. That portion had been purchased by the West Hartlepool Corporation on 31 August 1912. The first of the West Hartlepool tramways to be closed was the Foggy Furze line, which was shut down on 4 October 1923. The services on that line were temporarily replaced by motor buses, until opening of the trolleybus system. The Ward Jackson Park tramway was next to be closed, in November 1925. Conversion of the tramway from West Hartlepool to Hartlepool was a more complex process, because the Hartlepool Corporation had obtained powers to run motor buses. Following lengthy negotiations, Hartlepool purchased the portion of the tramway within its boundaries, and, under the Hartlepool Corporation Trolley Vehicles Act 1926, was given powers to operate trolleybuses. Conversion of the West Hartlepool to Hartlepool line then took place on 22 February 1927. One month later, on 25 March 1927, the Seaton Carew tramway was converted, bringing Hartlepool's tramway era to an end, and its trolleybus system to its greatest extent. The system as a whole was operated by West Hartlepool Corporation. However, the route between the two towns was run on behalf of both authorities. The trolleybuses used on that route were jointly owned; each Corporation paid half the running costs of the joint route and was entitled to half of its revenue. After the end of World War II, West Hartlepool Corporation decided to replace the trolleybus system with motor buses. In 1949, the Seaton Carew route was shut down. Closure of the other two West Hartlepool lines soon followed. Finally, on , the joint route was closed. Services By the standards of the various now defunct trolleybus systems in the United Kingdom, the Hartlepool system, with its four routes, was quite small. Fleet West Hartlepool's first trolleybuses were four Railless 4-wheel vehicles with Short Brothers 36-seat bodywork. They were numbered 1‚Äì4. In 1926, they were joined by two similar vehicles (Nos. 5‚Äì6) and a double-deck version (No. 7). The first jointly owned vehicles were twelve Straker-Clough single-deckers (Nos. 8‚Äì19). They entered service in 1927. In 1938, these vehicles were replaced by more jointly owned units, this time high capacity double-deckers (Nos. 32‚Äì39), built by Daimler. All of the jointly owned vehicles carried the armorial devices of the two Corporations on their side panels. The system had a total fleet of 48 trolleybuses, with a maximum of 31 in service at any one time. None of them is recorded as having survived.

Biography =Parents= Ashraf traces his lineage to a family of Syeds in Kichhauchha Sharif, a small town in the district of Ambedkar Nagar, eastern Uttar Pradesh. He was born on 4 February 1933, the third child of librarian Syed Habeeb Ashraf and Syeda Saeeda. Habeeb worked in the village library; although he was enrolled at Firangi Mahal, a madrasa in Lucknow, he did not complete his education due to the death of his father. He was well- versed in Ilmul Jafar and Ilmul Ramal (Islamic geomancy). Habeeb wrote to his eldest son, Syed Amin Ashraf (who was stationed in Aligarh), six months before his death asking him to be home on 3 February 1972 for his burial. Syeda Saeeda was the daughter of a Unani doctor in the village. Before her marriage, she assisted her father in the preparation of drugs in his dispensary and acquired a knowledge of Unani medicine (particularly diseases of women and children). = Siblings = Habeeb and Syeda had four sons and three daughters. The two elder sons were Syed Amin Ashraf and Syed Hameed Ashraf. The youngest son (and their fifth child) was Syed Ashraf. Their daughters were Syeda Mahmooda, Syeda Masooda and Syeda Raheen. Syed Amin Ashraf received his PhD in English literature from Aligarh Muslim University, and later taught in the same department. Amin Ashraf is regarded as an accomplished poet in Urdu ghazals. He has compiled three poetic collections ‚Äì Jadae Shab, Bahare Ijaad and Qafase Rang ‚Äì and a collection of his papers in a book, Bargo Bar. He has received awards from Ghalib Academy, New Delhi and Uttar Pradesh Urdu Academy in Lucknow. Several critical essays about his poetry have been published. Their second son, Syed Hameed Ashraf (who died in 1993), studied Shariah at Al Jamiatul Ashrafia Mubarakpur and Darul Uloom Deoband, received B.A., M.A. and M.Phil degrees in Arabic literature from Aligarh Muslim University and taught at a number of Indian madrasas. Syed Waheed Ashraf learned Islamic theology from his brother, Syed Hameed Ashraf. = Education = Ashraf received his primary education from the village madrasa and graduated from middle school in Baskhari, a small town near his home, in 1948. He received his high-school certificate from Mohd. Hasan Inter College in Jaunpur District. After high school, Ashraf suspended his studies for seven years due to poor health. He then earned his undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral degrees (1965) from Aligarh Muslim University. = Professional career = After receiving his PhD, Ashraf was a temporary lecturer at Punjabi University in Patiala for a year before returning to Aligarh University as a UGC senior research fellow.

History It was formed in 1999 by a group of Midlands engineers who were concerned about a perceived lowering of interest in engineering activities by schoolchildren, leading to a skills shortage in the STEM subjects. It was launched as an educational charity on 31 July 2001. The website was developed in 2004, with educational material for the clubs. Structure It is based in Warwickshire. It also has a substantial online presence with a website built so tutors can access project material. Function =Clubs= It currently organizes 147 engineering clubs mostly in England, but with two in Wales and five in Scotland. Most of the clubs are in the West Midlands, and to a lesser extent in the East Midlands (Northamptonshire). Each week, around 1800 children take part in the clubs. It publishes a magazine called The Imagineer. =Fairs= It hosts children's engineering fairs at the Royal Bath and West Show, the Royal International Air Tattoo at RAF Fairford, and the International Air Day at RNAS Yeovilton. These events are often attended by people (parents) already interested in engineering - the organization's target audience.

Plot Saumitra (Kaushik Sen), a brilliant artist (Painter and sculptor), visits Khajuraho to draw inspiration and meets Teesta (Churni Ganguly) there through a common friend, Anjit (Tota) who is an artiste too. Love blossoms between them in Kolkata and though their family and economic standards are poles apart, they decide to marry. Teesta breaks away from her rich, blue blood family. On the marriage night Kaushik, to his shock, discovers that Teesta is flat-chested. The shock develops into sense of being cheated, anger and finally hatred. Teesta goes and seeks solution from Sharmistha di (Rupa Ganguly) her boss. When Soumitra turns up there he is turned away. Soumitra draws a diagram one day and shows the shortcoming of Teesta's body to Joydeep (Kharaj Mukherjee) who in turns tells it to Sujoy, Sujoy to Anjit. Teesta comes to know about this from Anjit. She asks Soumitro not to make a mockery of her any more and asks for a divorce. A few years later Soumitro again comes across Anjit and Teesta with their daughter at the back.

In 2014, LNA launched Operation Dignity, a military campaign against the General National Congress and armed militias and Islamist militant organizations. When the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) was established in Tripoli, part of the Libyan military forces were named the Libyan Army to contrast with the other part that retained the LNA identity. In the ongoing Civil War, the LNA is loyal to that part of the Libyan House of Representatives that meets in Tobruk, internationally recognised until October 2015. It fights against the Shura Council of Benghazi Revolutionaries, as well as Islamic State in Libya which is a common enemy for both LNA and the Libyan Army. About half of the LNA consists of militias including Madkhali (Salafist) militias and Sudanese, Chadian and Russian mercenaries, which together constitute part of the LNA's effective forces. The LNA possesses its own air force. Most of the Libyan Navy is loyal to the GNA. Interventions in the political system by the LNA include the late 2016 replacement of nine elected municipal councils out of a total of 27, replacing elected mayors by mostly military individuals and, according to witnesses cited by The Independent, the 17 July 2019 abduction of House of Representatives member Seham Sergiwa at her home in Benghazi by the 106th Brigade. The LNA stated that it was not responsible for the Sergiwa abduction.  Name  In November 2019, the United Nations Panel of Experts on Libya established under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 started using the name Haftar Armed Forces (HAF) to replace the name Libyan National Army to refer to \\"all armed groups associated with Haftar\\". It also chose to use lower case regarding \\"brigades\\" and \\"battalions\\" in order to avoid giving them \\"the legitimacy of being a formed military unit of a government\\".  Structure  * ground forces ** regular forces ** Special Forces ** military intelligence ** militias ** foreign units * LNA component of the Libyan Air Force * naval forces: coastal patrol vessels Ranks  Leadership  Khalifa Haftar was made head of the armed forces of Libya on 2 March 2015, remaining as leader of the Libyan National Army after the split between the LNA and the Government of National Accord (GNA). , Major General Abdulrazek al-Nadoori was the chief of staff of the LNA. A lobbying firm was paid to lobby on his behalf for 12 months, starting 1 December 2017, in Washington, D.C. Mahmoud al-Werfalli, known internationally for his International Criminal Court arrest warrant under Article 8(2)(c)(i) of the Rome Statute, was Axes Commander in the al-Saiqa unit of the LNA .

It numbers a few thousand and reports to the Ministry of Defence. It is popular in Benghazi, particularly in light of its opposition to Islamist Ansar al-Sharia group and because it is seen as a symbol of the reborn Libyan armed forces. =Militias= Madkhali militias in the LNA include the Tawhid Battalion commanded by Izz al-Din al-Tarhuni; the Tariq Ibn Ziyad Brigade, the Subul al-Salam group and the al-Wadi Brigade. LNA groups from Sabratha, Sorman, Tiji and Badr, towns in which Madkhali preachers were active and supported Haftar, are mostly Madkhali Salafists. During the 2019‚Äì20 Western Libya campaign, the LNA was allied with the al-Kaniyat militia in Tarhuna. The number of auxiliary LNA forces (militias and mercenaries) was estimated in May 2019 as by Jason Pack of the Institute for International Political Studies. =Foreign mercenaries= Foreign mercenaries operating during 2019 Western Libya offensive on behalf of the LNA include Sudanese, Chadians and Russians. Sudanese from the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army (Minnawi) were present in Libya starting in March 2015 and fought on behalf of the LNA in 2016. SLM (Minnawi) planned on leaving Libya in early 2017. Sudan Liberation Movement/Army (al-Nur) fighters fought on behalf of the LNA, with personnel in Libya in mid-2016. Involvement of Sudanese mercenaries continued in 2018. On 25 July 2019, 1000 members of the Sudanese Rapid Support Forces, widely attributed to be responsible for the 3 June 2019 Khartoum massacre, arrived in Libya and were expected to number 4000 in total. Chadians from the Rally of Democratic Forces () were recruited by the LNA in late 2015, especially in the southern part of Libya. There were an estimated 200 Russian Wagner Group mercenaries in the LNA in 2019. History =2011‚Äì2013= The Libyan National Army was founded in 2011 by the National Transitional Council, after forces aligned to it defeated the previous Libyan Army and overthrew Muammar Gaddafi's regime. Supply depots and bases having been damaged during the civil war, the new army is faced with the challenge of having to rebuild much of the country's military infrastructure. Yousef Mangoush was named as its first Chief of Staff on 2 January 2012 and the force saw its first major deployment on 23 February, when it was deployed to Kufra to intervene in a tribal conflict. In November 2011, the National Transitional Council began the difficult process of restructuring the army, with military personnel who defected from the Gaddafi government and former rebel fighters of the National Liberation Army forming the basis of the new Libyan Army. Major General Khalifa Belgacem Haftar was chosen as the overall commander of the new Libyan Army due to his military experience and loyalty to the revolution that overthrew Gaddafi. The Libyan Army only numbered \\"a few thousand\\" trained soldiers in November 2011, and was rapidly trying to train up new fighters who could keep the peace nationwide and deter rogue militias from acting without NTC orders, and was responsible for brokering a ceasefire on at least one occasion in November between warring militas from Zawiya and Al Maya. On 1 December 2011, it was reported that the National Liberation Army was to integrate up to 50,000 former rebel fighters into the new Libyan national army and police forces, with the aid of French training, with long-term aims to integrate as many as 200,000 fighters from the brigades that had fought against Gaddafi during the civil war. In December 2011, Italy agreed to provide training to the Libyan Army as it attempted to reorganize in the aftermath of the Civil War. Also in December, large numbers of former rebels were being given jobs in the new army, whilst the government also announced that they would be free to join the special forces and the Navy too. According to Osama al-Juwaili, the defence minister: \\"The idea is to inject new blood in the army which was marginalised by the tyrant (Gaddafi)\\" General Yousef Mangoush said on 5 January 2012 that Libya's new army faces major obstacles such as rebuilding bases destroyed during the conflict, as well as disarming militias that were not part of the new army. National Army commander General Khalifa Haftar said later that it could take between three and five years for Libya to field a capable enough army to protect its borders. On 7 May 2013, Libya's Defense Minister Mohammed al-Barghathi resigned due to a crisis caused by gunmen who have besieged two ministries for more than a week, a ministry official said. He later withdrew his resignation after Prime Minister Zeidan convinced him to stay. Under an agreement reached at the Lough Erne G8 summit in June 2013, NATO countries the United Kingdom, Italy, Turkey, and the United States undertook to help train up to 15,000 personnel from Libyan National Army units over a two-year period. They were to take units from newly formed brigades for 10-week stints of intensive infantry training. The 27th Brigade was due to start at Bassingbourn in eastern England in January 2014. As a result of disorder and sexual assaults by some Libyan army cadets, the UK cancelled the programme in November 2014. The Libyan trainees were sent back to Libya, with the exception of five who were tried for sexual offenses. =2016 overthrow of mayors= In late 2016, Major-General Abdulrazek al- Nadoori of the LNA replaced several of the elected municipal mayors in eastern Libya by unelected people, mostly military. Altogether the LNA replaced nine elected councils, out of 27 in its area of control, by military administrators. Equipment Whilst it is known to a degree what equipment the Libyan National Army uses, the exact numbers of the below equipment currently in use is not known. What is certain is that a reasonable quantity of their equipment probably came from ransacked stocks of the original Libyan Army and from defectors as well. =Technicals= A variety of pickup/utility vehicles, called technicals and gun trucks, often Toyota and other makers, armed with a variety of different weapons, including heavy machineguns, light MLRS' and anti-aircraft guns, most commonly used is the ZU-23-2 and the ZPU. =Tanks= * ‚Äì T-34 * ‚Äì T-55 * ‚Äì T-62 * ‚Äì T-72 =Armoured personnel carriers= * ‚Äì BTR-60 * ‚Äì BRDM-2 * ‚Äì BMP-1 * ‚Äì BMP-3 ‚Äì 10 delivered in 2013 * ‚Äì Nimr ‚Äì 169 in service * ‚Äì Panthera F9 ‚Äì Received from UAE * ‚Äì Puma 4√ó4 ‚Äì 20 donated by Italy * ‚Äì M1151 HMMWV ‚Äì 200 donated by the U.S. Army =Artillery= * ‚Äì BM-21 Grad ‚Äì Multiple Rocket Launch System * ‚Äì Type 63 multiple rocket launcher =Portable anti-tank weapons= * ‚Äì Carl Gustav recoilless rifle * ‚Äì M40 recoilless rifle * ‚Äì FGM-148 Javelin * ‚Äì M79 Osa * RPG-7 ‚Äì In widespread use by all factions in the conflict. =Anti-tank guided missiles= * MILAN ‚Äì From government stocks. * ‚Äì AT-3 \\"Malyutka\\" ‚Äì From government stocks. * ‚Äì AT-4 \\"Fagot\\" ‚Äì From government stocks. * ‚Äì AT-5 \\"Konkurs\\" ‚Äì From government stocks. =Self-propelled anti-air gun= * ‚Äì ZSU-23-4 See also *National Liberation Army Notes References * Category:Military of Libya Category:Libyan Civil War (2014‚Äìpresent) Category:Rebel groups in Libya ","title":"Libyan National Army"},{"id":"35457672","text":"Silene seelyi is a species of flowering plant in the family Caryophyllaceae known by the common names Seely's catchfly and Seely's silene.

Throughout her life she completed many sailing feats including sailing around the world seven times while training younger sailors. Early life Electa \\"Exy\\" Johnson was born in Rochester, New York on August 17, 1909. She attended Smith College and then University of California, Berkeley. Exy Johnson's sailing experience started after her years in college when she boarded a schooner set to sail around France. Exy Johnson was fluent in French and German, and also had the ability to communicate in other languages. While aboard the schooner touring France she met her soon to be husband Irving Johnson, who at the time was a crew member aboard the schooner. In 1932 Exy and Irving got married and began their sailing career together. Teaching sailing Exy and Irving Johnson began sailing the world together and teaching young enthusiasts in 1932. From then until 1958, they went on seven tours, three before World War II and four after, all of which circumnavigated the world. Exy and Irving did not sail during the war. Each tour had a new crew of two dozen fresh recruits ready to learn. Each voyage would visit 120 ports of call and crew members paid $4,860 to participate. Each tour lasted about 18 months after which Exy and Irving would take 18 months off. During their breaks, they would work on their books, lecture students, and work on films. The books they wrote are listed below. Also if Exy and Irving had free time during their summer off they would show young girl scouts how to sail by sailing up and down the coast of New England. Exy and Irving used different types of sailing vessels for training their crew mates. The first ship they had was a 92-foot wooden schooner named Yankee. The next ship they used for training was a 96-foot steel brigantine also named Yankee. Their final ship was a 50-foot ketch named Yankee. This ketch was primarily for their own personal use after their years of training. In her lifetime, Exy sailed further than the distance to the moon. Later years Exy and Irving had two children, Robert and Arthur. As soon as the boys could walk they boarded ship and began to sail with the family. After 1958, when Exy and Irving were done teaching young people how to sail, they went on their own personal tour from 1958 to 1975. On this they mainly sailed their 50-foot ketch and toured around exploring the European water ways. Exy finally retired from sailing in 1975 where she and her husband settled down in Hadley, Massachusetts on a farm that Irving had grown up on. In 1991 Irving died but Exy kept working to keep the legacy alive. The Los Angeles Maritime Institute has recently honored Irving and Exy by naming their twin brigantines for use in their award-winning Topsail Youth program after them. The doyenne of modern sail training, Exy Johnson would personally oversee the christening ceremonies of the vessels she was instrumental in constructing prior to her death in 2004. The tall ship Exy Johnson named in her honor Books =Yankee Sails Across Europe= Exy and Irving trip in the European water ways took them over 10,000 miles in the Mediterranean and Baltic seas. The Yankee's home base during their trip was the island of Ischia in the bay of Naples. During their trip they went to Corfu and the port island by Odysseus and St. Paul. They then sailed westward to Sicily and Elba. They then sailed in Switzerland after they sailed down into the Netherlands and Germany. After Germany they headed to Denmark and then back to the Baltic taking them to Finland. Once back in the Mediterranean they had ports of call in Corsica and ended back in Ischia. =Westward Bound in the Schooner Yankee= Westward Bound in the Schooner Yankee tells of Exy and Irving's first trip around the world. The Yankee left her home port Gloucester and hit notable ports all around the world including Galapagos, Tahiti, The Cook Islands, Fiji, Solomon Islands, and much more before heading home. During their first trip around the world they discovered one of the tallest waterfalls in the world which they named Yankee falls. During the 18-month trip Exy and the crew of the Yankee experienced native cultures that few even knew about at the time. =Yankee Sails the Nile= Yankee Sails the Nile is about Exy and Irving's trip on the Nile before the building of the Aswan High Dam which would cut off part of the Nile. They sailed the heavy traffic of the Nile starting in Nile delta and headed down to Cairo. After Cairo the Yankee Sailed to see the Pyramids of Karnack and the tomb of Abu Simnel. =Bibliography= * (reprinted as )   * Articles *Irving and Electa Johnson; Westward Bound in the Yankee (National Geographic Magazine, January 1942) *Irving and Electa Johnson; The Yankee's Wander World (National Geographic Magazine, January 1949) *Irving and Electa Johnson.

Holevo, Schumacher, and Westmoreland proved the following least upper bound on the classical capacity of any quantum channel \\\\mathcal{N}: : \\\\chi(\\\\mathcal{N}) = \\\\max_{\\\\rho^{XA}} I(X;B)_{\\\\mathcal{N}(\\\\rho)} where \\\\rho^{XA} is a classical-quantum state of the following form: : \\\\rho^{XA} = \\\\sum_x p_X(x) \\\\vert x \\\\rangle \\\\langle x \\\\vert^X \\\\otimes \\\\rho_x^A , p_X(x) is a probability distribution, and each \\\\rho_x^A is a density operator that can be input to the channel \\\\mathcal{N}.  Achievability using sequential decoding  We briefly review the HSW coding theorem (the statement of the achievability of the Holevo information rate I(X;B) for communicating classical data over a quantum channel). We first review the minimal amount of quantum mechanics needed for the theorem. We then cover quantum typicality, and finally we prove the theorem using a recent sequential decoding technique. Review of quantum mechanics In order to prove the HSW coding theorem, we really just need a few basic things from quantum mechanics. First, a quantum state is a unit trace, positive operator known as a density operator. Usually, we denote it by \\\\rho, \\\\sigma, \\\\omega, etc. The simplest model for a quantum channel is known as a classical-quantum channel: x\\\\mapsto \\\\rho_{x}. The meaning of the above notation is that inputting the classical letter x at the transmitting end leads to a quantum state \\\\rho_{x} at the receiving end. It is the task of the receiver to perform a measurement to determine the input of the sender. If it is true that the states \\\\rho_{x} are perfectly distinguishable from one another (i.e., if they have orthogonal supports such that \\\\mathrm{Tr}\\\\,\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\rho_{x}\\\\rho_{x^{\\\\prime}}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} =0 for x eq x^{\\\\prime} ), then the channel is a noiseless channel. We are interested in situations for which this is not the case. If it is true that the states \\\\rho_{x} all commute with one another, then this is effectively identical to the situation for a classical channel, so we are also not interested in these situations. So, the situation in which we are interested is that in which the states \\\\rho_{x} have overlapping support and are non-commutative. The most general way to describe a quantum measurement is with a positive operator-valued measure (POVM). We usually denote the elements of a POVM as \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\Lambda_{m}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} _{m}. These operators should satisfy positivity and completeness in order to form a valid POVM: : \\\\Lambda_{m} \\\\geq0\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\forall m :\\\\sum_{m}\\\\Lambda_{m} =I. The probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics states that if someone measures a quantum state \\\\rho using a measurement device corresponding to the POVM \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\Lambda_{m}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} , then the probability p\\\\left( m\\\\right) for obtaining outcome m is equal to : p\\\\left( m\\\\right) =\\\\text{Tr}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\Lambda_{m}\\\\rho\\\\right\\\\\\\\} , and the post-measurement state is : \\\\rho_{m}^{\\\\prime}=\\\\frac{1}{p\\\\left( m\\\\right) }\\\\sqrt{\\\\Lambda_{m}}\\\\rho \\\\sqrt{\\\\Lambda_{m}}, if the person measuring obtains outcome m. These rules are sufficient for us to consider classical communication schemes over cq channels. Quantum typicality The reader can find a good review of this topic in the article about the typical subspace. Gentle operator lemma The following lemma is important for our proofs. It demonstrates that a measurement that succeeds with high probability on average does not disturb the state too much on average: Lemma: [Winter] Given an ensemble \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ p_{X}\\\\left( x\\\\right) ,\\\\rho_{x}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} with expected density operator \\\\rho\\\\equiv\\\\sum_{x}p_{X}\\\\left( x\\\\right) \\\\rho_{x}, suppose that an operator \\\\Lambda such that I\\\\geq\\\\Lambda\\\\geq0 succeeds with high probability on the state \\\\rho: \\\\text{Tr}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\Lambda\\\\rho\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\geq1-\\\\epsilon. Then the subnormalized state \\\\sqrt{\\\\Lambda}\\\\rho_{x}\\\\sqrt{\\\\Lambda} is close in expected trace distance to the original state \\\\rho_{x}: \\\\mathbb{E}_{X}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\left\\\\Vert \\\\sqrt{\\\\Lambda}\\\\rho_{X}\\\\sqrt{\\\\Lambda} -\\\\rho_{X}\\\\right\\\\Vert _{1}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\leq2\\\\sqrt{\\\\epsilon}. (Note that \\\\left\\\\Vert A\\\\right\\\\Vert _{1} is the nuclear norm of the operator A so that \\\\left\\\\Vert A\\\\right\\\\Vert _{1}\\\\equivTr\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\sqrt{A^{\\\\dagger} A}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} .) The following inequality is useful for us as well. It holds for any operators \\\\rho, \\\\sigma, \\\\Lambda such that 0\\\\leq\\\\rho,\\\\sigma,\\\\Lambda\\\\leq I: The quantum information-theoretic interpretation of the above inequality is that the probability of obtaining outcome \\\\Lambda from a quantum measurement acting on the state \\\\rho is upper bounded by the probability of obtaining outcome \\\\Lambda on the state \\\\sigma summed with the distinguishability of the two states \\\\rho and \\\\sigma. Non- commutative union bound Lemma: [Sen's bound] The following bound holds for a subnormalized state \\\\sigma such that 0\\\\leq\\\\sigma and Tr\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\sigma\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\leq1 with \\\\Pi_{1}, ... , \\\\Pi_{N} being projectors: \\\\text{Tr}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\sigma\\\\right\\\\\\\\} -\\\\text{Tr}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\Pi_{N}\\\\cdots\\\\Pi _{1}\\\\ \\\\sigma\\\\ \\\\Pi_{1}\\\\cdots\\\\Pi_{N}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\leq2\\\\sqrt{\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\\\text{Tr}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\left( I-\\\\Pi_{i}\\\\right) \\\\sigma\\\\right\\\\\\\\} }, We can think of Sen's bound as a \\"non-commutative union bound\\" because it is analogous to the following union bound from probability theory: \\\\Pr\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\left( A_{1}\\\\cap\\\\cdots\\\\cap A_{N}\\\\right) ^{c}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} =\\\\Pr\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ A_{1}^{c}\\\\cup\\\\cdots\\\\cup A_{N}^{c}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\leq\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\\\Pr\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ A_{i}^{c}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} , where A_{1}, \\\\ldots, A_{N} are events. The analogous bound for projector logic would be : \\\\text{Tr}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\left( I-\\\\Pi_{1}\\\\cdots\\\\Pi_{N}\\\\cdots\\\\Pi_{1}\\\\right) \\\\rho\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\leq\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\\\text{Tr}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\left( I-\\\\Pi_{i}\\\\right) \\\\rho\\\\right\\\\\\\\} , if we think of \\\\Pi_{1}\\\\cdots\\\\Pi_{N} as a projector onto the intersection of subspaces. Though, the above bound only holds if the projectors \\\\Pi_{1}, ..., \\\\Pi_{N} are commuting (choosing \\\\Pi_{1}=\\\\left\\\\vert +\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\left\\\\langle +\\\\right\\\\vert , \\\\Pi_{2}=\\\\left\\\\vert 0\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\left\\\\langle 0\\\\right\\\\vert , and \\\\rho=\\\\left\\\\vert 0\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\left\\\\langle 0\\\\right\\\\vert gives a counterexample). If the projectors are non-commuting, then Sen's bound is the next best thing and suffices for our purposes here. HSW theorem with the non-commutative union bound We now prove the HSW theorem with Sen's non- commutative union bound. We divide up the proof into a few parts: codebook generation, POVM construction, and error analysis. Codebook Generation. We first describe how Alice and Bob agree on a random choice of code. They have the channel x\\\\rightarrow\\\\rho_{x} and a distribution p_{X}\\\\left( x\\\\right) . They choose M classical sequences x^{n} according to the IID\\\\ distribution p_{X^{n}}\\\\left( x^{n}\\\\right) . After selecting them, they label them with indices as \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ x^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) \\\\right\\\\\\\\} _{m\\\\in\\\\left[ M\\\\right] }. This leads to the following quantum codewords: \\\\rho_{x^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) }=\\\\rho_{x_{1}\\\\left( m\\\\right) }\\\\otimes \\\\cdots\\\\otimes\\\\rho_{x_{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) }. The quantum codebook is then \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\rho_{x^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) }\\\\right\\\\\\\\} . The average state of the codebook is then \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\rho_{X^{n}}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} =\\\\sum_{x^{n}}p_{X^{n}}\\\\left( x^{n}\\\\right) \\\\rho_{x^{n}}=\\\\rho^{\\\\otimes n}, }} where \\\\rho=\\\\sum_{x}p_{X}\\\\left( x\\\\right) \\\\rho_{x}. POVM Construction . Sens' bound from the above lemma suggests a method for Bob to decode a state that Alice transmits. Bob should first ask \\"Is the received state in the average typical subspace?\\" He can do this operationally by performing a typical subspace measurement corresponding to \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta} ^{n},I-\\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta}^{n}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} . Next, he asks in sequential order, \\"Is the received codeword in the m^{\\\\text{th}} conditionally typical subspace?\\" This is in some sense equivalent to the question, \\"Is the received codeword the m^{\\\\text{th}} transmitted codeword?\\" He can ask these questions operationally by performing the measurements corresponding to the conditionally typical projectors \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho_{x^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) },\\\\delta},I-\\\\Pi_{\\\\rho_{x^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} . Why should this sequential decoding scheme work well? The reason is that the transmitted codeword lies in the typical subspace on average: : \\\\mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\text{Tr}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta}\\\\ \\\\rho_{X^{n} }\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} =\\\\text{Tr}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta}\\\\ \\\\mathbb{E} _{X^{n}}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\rho_{X^{n}}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} : =\\\\text{Tr}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta}\\\\ \\\\rho^{\\\\otimes n}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} : \\\\geq1-\\\\epsilon, where the inequality follows from (\\\\ref{eq:1st-typ-prop}). Also, the projectors \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho_{x^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) },\\\\delta} are \\"good detectors\\" for the states \\\\rho_{x^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) } (on average) because the following condition holds from conditional quantum typicality: \\\\mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\text{Tr}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho_{X^{n}},\\\\delta} \\\\ \\\\rho_{X^{n}}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\geq1-\\\\epsilon. Error Analysis. The probability of detecting the m^{\\\\text{th}} codeword correctly under our sequential decoding scheme is equal to \\\\text{Tr}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\hat{\\\\Pi} _{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m-1\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\cdots\\\\hat{\\\\Pi}_{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( 1\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\ \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta}^{n}\\\\ \\\\rho_{x^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) }\\\\ \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta}^{n}\\\\ \\\\hat{\\\\Pi}_{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( 1\\\\right) },\\\\delta }\\\\cdots\\\\hat{\\\\Pi}_{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m-1\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\Pi_{\\\\rho _{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} , where we make the abbreviation \\\\hat{\\\\Pi}\\\\equiv I-\\\\Pi. (Observe that we project into the average typical subspace just once.) Thus, the probability of an incorrect detection for the m^{\\\\text{th}} codeword is given by 1-\\\\text{Tr}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\hat{\\\\Pi} _{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m-1\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\cdots\\\\hat{\\\\Pi}_{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( 1\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\ \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta}^{n}\\\\ \\\\rho_{x^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) }\\\\ \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta}^{n}\\\\ \\\\hat{\\\\Pi}_{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( 1\\\\right) },\\\\delta }\\\\cdots\\\\hat{\\\\Pi}_{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m-1\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\Pi_{\\\\rho _{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} , and the average error probability of this scheme is equal to 1-\\\\frac{1}{M}\\\\sum_{m}\\\\text{Tr}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\hat{\\\\Pi}_{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m-1\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\cdots\\\\hat{\\\\Pi }_{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( 1\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\ \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta}^{n}\\\\ \\\\rho _{x^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) }\\\\ \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta}^{n}\\\\ \\\\hat{\\\\Pi}_{\\\\rho _{X^{n}\\\\left( 1\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\cdots\\\\hat{\\\\Pi}_{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m-1\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\Pi_{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} . Instead of analyzing the average error probability, we analyze the expectation of the average error probability, where the expectation is with respect to the random choice of code: \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{1}{M}\\\\sum_{m}\\\\text{Tr}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\Pi _{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\hat{\\\\Pi}_{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m-1\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\cdots\\\\hat{\\\\Pi}_{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( 1\\\\right) },\\\\delta }\\\\ \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta}^{n}\\\\ \\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) }\\\\ \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta }^{n}\\\\ \\\\hat{\\\\Pi}_{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( 1\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\cdots\\\\hat{\\\\Pi} _{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m-1\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\Pi_{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} . }} Our first step is to apply Sen's bound to the above quantity. But before doing so, we should rewrite the above expression just slightly, by observing that : 1 =\\\\mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{1}{M}\\\\sum_{m}\\\\text{Tr}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) }\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} : =\\\\mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{1}{M}\\\\sum_{m}\\\\text{Tr}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\Pi _{\\\\rho,\\\\delta}^{n}\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) }\\\\right\\\\\\\\} +\\\\text{Tr}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\hat{\\\\Pi}_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta}^{n}\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) }\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} : =\\\\mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{1}{M}\\\\sum_{m}\\\\text{Tr}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\Pi _{\\\\rho,\\\\delta}^{n}\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) }\\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta}^{n}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} +\\\\frac{1}{M}\\\\sum_{m}\\\\text{Tr}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\hat{\\\\Pi}_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta} ^{n}\\\\mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) }\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} : =\\\\mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{1}{M}\\\\sum_{m}\\\\text{Tr}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\Pi _{\\\\rho,\\\\delta}^{n}\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) }\\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta}^{n}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} +\\\\text{Tr}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\hat{\\\\Pi}_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta}^{n}\\\\rho^{\\\\otimes n}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} : \\\\leq\\\\mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{1}{M}\\\\sum_{m}\\\\text{Tr}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta}^{n}\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) }\\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta} ^{n}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} +\\\\epsilon Substituting into () (and forgetting about the small \\\\epsilon term for now) gives an upper bound of : \\\\mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{1}{M}\\\\sum_{m}\\\\text{Tr}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\Pi _{\\\\rho,\\\\delta}^{n}\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) }\\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta}^{n}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} : -\\\\mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{1}{M}\\\\sum_{m}\\\\text{Tr}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\Pi _{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\hat{\\\\Pi}_{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m-1\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\cdots\\\\hat{\\\\Pi}_{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( 1\\\\right) },\\\\delta }\\\\ \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta}^{n}\\\\ \\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) }\\\\ \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta }^{n}\\\\ \\\\hat{\\\\Pi}_{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( 1\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\cdots\\\\hat{\\\\Pi} _{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m-1\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\Pi_{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} . We then apply Sen's bound to this expression with \\\\sigma=\\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta }^{n}\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) }\\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta}^{n} and the sequential projectors as \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) },\\\\delta}, \\\\hat{\\\\Pi} _{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m-1\\\\right) },\\\\delta}, ..., \\\\hat{\\\\Pi}_{\\\\rho _{X^{n}\\\\left( 1\\\\right) },\\\\delta}. This gives the upper bound \\\\mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{1}{M}\\\\sum_{m}2\\\\left[ \\\\text{Tr}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\left( I-\\\\Pi_{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\right) \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho ,\\\\delta}^{n}\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) }\\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta}^{n}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} +\\\\sum_{i=1}^{m-1}\\\\text{Tr}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( i\\\\right) },\\\\delta }\\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta}^{n}\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) }\\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta} ^{n}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\right] ^{1/2}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} . Due to concavity of the square root, we can bound this expression from above by : 2\\\\left[ \\\\mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{1}{M}\\\\sum_{m}\\\\text{Tr}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\left( I-\\\\Pi_{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\right) \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho ,\\\\delta}^{n}\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) }\\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta}^{n}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} +\\\\sum_{i=1}^{m-1}\\\\text{Tr}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( i\\\\right) },\\\\delta }\\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta}^{n}\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) }\\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta} ^{n}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\right] ^{1/2} : \\\\leq2\\\\left[ \\\\mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{1}{M}\\\\sum_{m}\\\\text{Tr}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\left( I-\\\\Pi_{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\right) \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho ,\\\\delta}^{n}\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) }\\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta}^{n}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} +\\\\sum_{i eq m}\\\\text{Tr}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( i\\\\right) },\\\\delta }\\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta}^{n}\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) }\\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta} ^{n}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\right] ^{1/2}, where the second bound follows by summing over all of the codewords not equal to the m^{\\\\text{th}} codeword (this sum can only be larger). We now focus exclusively on showing that the term inside the square root can be made small. Consider the first term: : \\\\mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{1}{M}\\\\sum_{m}\\\\text{Tr}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\left( I-\\\\Pi_{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\right) \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta} ^{n}\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) }\\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta}^{n}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} : \\\\leq\\\\mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{1}{M}\\\\sum_{m}\\\\text{Tr}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\left( I-\\\\Pi_{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\right) \\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) }\\\\right\\\\\\\\} +\\\\left\\\\Vert \\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) }-\\\\Pi _{\\\\rho,\\\\delta}^{n}\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) }\\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta} ^{n}\\\\right\\\\Vert _{1}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} : \\\\leq\\\\epsilon+2\\\\sqrt{\\\\epsilon}. where the first inequality follows from () and the second inequality follows from the gentle operator lemma and the properties of unconditional and conditional typicality. Consider now the second term and the following chain of inequalities: : \\\\sum_{i eq m}\\\\mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\text{Tr}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho _{X^{n}\\\\left( i\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\ \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta}^{n}\\\\ \\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) }\\\\ \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta}^{n}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} : =\\\\sum_{i eq m}\\\\text{Tr}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\Pi _{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( i\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\ \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta} ^{n}\\\\ \\\\mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) }\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\ \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta}^{n}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} : =\\\\sum_{i eq m}\\\\text{Tr}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\Pi _{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( i\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\ \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta} ^{n}\\\\ \\\\rho^{\\\\otimes n}\\\\ \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta}^{n}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} : \\\\leq\\\\sum_{i eq m}2^{-n\\\\left[ H\\\\left( B\\\\right) -\\\\delta\\\\right] }\\\\ \\\\text{Tr}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( i\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\ \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta}^{n}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} The first equality follows because the codewords X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) and X^{n}\\\\left( i\\\\right) are independent since they are different. The second equality follows from (). The first inequality follows from (\\\\ref{eq:3rd-typ-prop}). Continuing, we have : \\\\leq\\\\sum_{i eq m}2^{-n\\\\left[ H\\\\left( B\\\\right) -\\\\delta\\\\right] }\\\\ \\\\mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\text{Tr}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( i\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} : \\\\leq\\\\sum_{i eq m}2^{-n\\\\left[ H\\\\left( B\\\\right) -\\\\delta\\\\right] }\\\\ 2^{n\\\\left[ H\\\\left( BX\\\\right) +\\\\delta\\\\right] } : =\\\\sum_{i eq m}2^{-n\\\\left[ I\\\\left( X;B\\\\right) -2\\\\delta\\\\right] } : \\\\leq M\\\\ 2^{-n\\\\left[ I\\\\left( X;B\\\\right) -2\\\\delta\\\\right] }. The first inequality follows from \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta}^{n}\\\\leq I and exchanging the trace with the expectation. The second inequality follows from (\\\\ref{eq:2nd-cond-typ}). The next two are straightforward. Putting everything together, we get our final bound on the expectation of the average error probability: : 1-\\\\mathbb{E}_{X^{n}}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{1}{M}\\\\sum_{m}\\\\text{Tr}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\Pi _{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\hat{\\\\Pi}_{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m-1\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\cdots\\\\hat{\\\\Pi}_{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( 1\\\\right) },\\\\delta }\\\\ \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta}^{n}\\\\ \\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) }\\\\ \\\\Pi_{\\\\rho,\\\\delta }^{n}\\\\ \\\\hat{\\\\Pi}_{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( 1\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\cdots\\\\hat{\\\\Pi} _{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m-1\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\Pi_{\\\\rho_{X^{n}\\\\left( m\\\\right) },\\\\delta}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} :\\\\leq\\\\epsilon+2\\\\left[ \\\\left( \\\\epsilon+2\\\\sqrt{\\\\epsilon}\\\\right) +M\\\\ 2^{-n\\\\left[ I\\\\left( X;B\\\\right) -2\\\\delta\\\\right] }\\\\right] ^{1/2}. Thus, as long as we choose M=2^{n\\\\left[ I\\\\left( X;B\\\\right) -3\\\\delta \\\\right] }, there exists a code with vanishing error probability.

It sits at 383 Swanston Street, on the northern edge of the Hoddle Grid that defines Melbourne's city centre. Completed in 1993, by Edmond and Corrigan Pty Ltd in association with The Demaine Partnership,http://www.demaine.net/Projects/1066380839859-9774/item/1066376359006/RMIT- BUILDING-8 Building 8 is an example of architecture in the Postmodern style.  Description  Standing 9 storeys tall, the building has a colourful postmodern facade that incorporates various elements such as stone of various colours, exposed piping and struts, as well as polychromatic brickwork of various shapes. Visually, Building 8 also shares a similar aesthetic to other buildings Peter Corrigan has designed, such as his Athan Househttp://aardvark.tce.rmit.edu.au/aardvark3/area-i/ECathanh/home.htm as well as the Victorian College of the Arts While Building 8's front-facing facade opens out into Swanston Street, its rear entrance connects it to Bowen Street, the primary thoroughfare running through the campus. Its rear facade is similarly decorated as well, a concrete face interspersed by coloured windows, and protrusions consisting of several windows and a service core. On the interior, the building shares much of the aesthetic that comprises its exterior, eschewing a traditional rectangular plan in favour of a more chaotic, polygonal layout. Its details are finished in a similar polychromatic, postmodern fashion. While the floors in Building 8 are relatively uniformly stratified, studios on the top floor have double or triple heighted ceilings to introduce a greater sense of space. Likewise, several rooms such as the lecture theatre and Swanston Library span several floors within the building. As part of the RMIT City campus, Building 8 houses many university functions, containing the Swanston Library, Student Union, and schools of Architecture, Interior Design, Landscape Building, Planning & Policy, Fashion, and Mathematics. It also contains facilities such as workshops, computer and photography labs, as well as access to rapid prototyping equipment. While the building is open to the public, use of services such as printing or library loans may require the use of a student issued identity card. Similarly, access doors to and within Building 8 may be locked outside of office hours, requiring an identity card to unlock. Building 8 is serviced by three lifts as well as a combination of staircases and escalators, and was also constructed over the top of the existing Union Building built by John Andrews. As the Union Building was already showing signs of load failure, this called for the creation of a special light-weight granite curtain wall facade in order to minimize weight as much as possible.

Key influences and design approach  As an example of Postmodern architecture, Building 8, in particular its facade, is a combination of various design elements borrowed from Melbourne's history. From Walter Burley Griffin, to Melbourne's Manchester Unity Building and Block Arcade, Building 8 is a pastiche of various influences. Colour is used liberally as well, setting it apart from the more reserved condition of existing buildings lining Swanston Street. As described in an architect's statement, \\"The aim was to delight and break down the dominant and seamless city-wall 'mood' RMIT presented on Swanston Street. The building's front, side and rear elevations create a whole from fragments and a collage of design 'ideas'. It presents itself to the city on its own terms.\\"  Awards  * RAIA Walter Burley Griffin National Award for Urban Design, 1995 * RAIA Vic Chapter Award for Institutional Alterations & Extensions, 1995 * RAIA Vic Chapter Medal, 1995 * City of Melbourne Award for Institutional Buildings, 1995 See also * RMIT University * Peter Corrigan * Edmond and Corrigan (Architectural Firm)  References  Further reading *  External links  * https://web.archive.org/web/20120715083805/http://architecture.rmit.edu.au/About/Building_8.php * http://www.walkingmelbourne.com/building366_rmit-building-8.html Building 8 Category:Buildings and structures in Melbourne Category:Melbourne City Centre ","title":"RMIT Building 8"},{"id":"35457771","text":"Secret History of Princess Taiping, also known as Taiping Gongzhu Mishi, is a 2012 Chinese historical television series. The protagonist is the firstborn daughter (posthumously known as Princess Andingsi, who died in infancy according to history) of Wu Zetian, the only female emperor in Chinese history. However, in this television series, the princess survived, and when she grows up she impersonates her younger sister Princess Taiping to take revenge on her mother and attempts to seize the throne for herself. Directed by Lee Hon-to and Zhou Min, the series starred three actresses ‚Äî Alyssa Chia, Zheng Shuang and Lin Miaoke ‚Äî as Princess Taiping, each playing the princess at a different stage of her life. It was first broadcast in mainland China on Hunan Satellite TV on 27 March 2012. Plot In 654, during the Tang dynasty, Wu Zetian (then a concubine of Emperor Gaozong) murdered her firstborn daughter (posthumously known as Princess Andingsi) and pushed the blame to Empress Wang. The princess's wet nurse, Zhaoniang, discovers that the baby princess is still alive and smuggles her out of the palace. Zhaoniang and the young princess escape from the capital and venture further north into the desert regions. Several years later, the princess has grown up and she develops a romantic relationship with Axiena Simu, a young Tujue prince. At one point, Zhaoniang dies trying to protect the princess. The princess learns the truth about her origins. She decides to seek vengeance on her mother Wu Zetian, who has seized the Tang throne and currently rules as a female emperor. The princess collaborates with Axiena Simu to kidnap Princess Taiping, Wu Zetian's younger daughter. As the two princesses resemble each other in appearance, the older one impersonates her younger sister and returns to the palace, where she plots her revenge and schemes to take over her mother's place as the ruler of China.

It was sunk by Typhoon Gay in the Gulf of Thailand on 3 November 1989. Ninety-one rig workers were killed after the vessel capsized, resulting in a massive legal case brought against the ship's owners UNOCAL. There were only six reported survivors: one Indonesian diver and five Thai rig crew, although these figures vary slightly depending on the source. Many of the bodies were never recovered. Typhoon Gay produced winds of 100 knots or more with 40 feet waves. It left hundreds of sunken fishing vessels in its wake, killing 529 people and leaving approximately 160,000 homeless. Before the storm DS Seacrest had been operating in the Gulf of Thailand since 1981 for the purpose of drilling gas wells for Unocal. At the time of the incident, Seacrest had been anchored at the Platong gas field. When drilling, the ship was moored over the well site by eight anchors distributed around the ship. Each anchor weighed 30,000 pounds and was connected to the ship by wire rope cables two inches in diameter and 7,000 feet in total length. All of the anchor cables on Seacrest were replaced with new cables during the summer of 1989, shortly before the storm. The ship heading as indicated on the last rig move report was 90¬∞ east. On 3 November 1989, the five-inch drill pipe had reached a depth of 3,707 feet. The rig had been in the tropical storm since the Tuesday, 31 October electric logging was performed. The superintendent ignored storm warnings, saying, \\"There hasn't been a typhoon for 50 years in the Gulf of Thailand, so keep working\\". There was 12,500 ft of drill-pipe in the derrick and the rig was out of survey since the top-drive had been installed. The superintendent's report stated that winds and seas increased at approximately 01:00 on the day of the capsize. The increasing severity of the weather forced the rig workers to hang the drill pipe in the hole on the lower rams. It was determined from the morning report that drilling activities ceased around midnight. By 03:00 the drill pipe in the hole was hanging on the lower rams. The rig workers, however, did not have time to lay down the 90 foot lengths of drill pipe that remained in the derrick. Typhoon Gay On 3 November 1989, the Seacrest capsized in Unocal's Platong gas field during the passage of Typhoon Gay. Seacrest had a crew of 97 at the time of the incident. Six survived. The cause of the capsize is attributed to the ship's unseaworthiness as well as the severe weather conditions encountered by the ship during the storm. Contrary to industry custom and practice, Unocal did not have a standby vessel tending to the Seacrest at the time she capsized, so the crewmen in the water were carried away by the typhoon and the loss of the ship went unnoticed until a helicopter found it floating upside down some four miles from its last location the next day, 4 November. No survivors were found at that time. Typhoon Gay was the first typhoon in the past forty years to form in the Gulf of Thailand. Other typhoons which have traversed the gulf have all formed outside the gulf and then entered the gulf, providing substantially more warning of their intensity and direction. Based on weather modelling, the hindcast analysis indicates that the storm rapidly intensified in the vicinity of the Platong field during the morning of 3 November. The storm reached typhoon strength as it approached the Seacrest. Thai military marine weather forecasts and the marine weather forecasts of a private weather service under contract to Unocal's partner in its activities in the Gulf of Thailand, Mitsui Oil Exploration Company (MOECO), had accurately predicted the general path of the storm toward the Seacrest's area of operation and its intensification in the days before 3 November. Despite the availability of these forecasts, Unocal did not provide weather information about the storm to the Seacrest until 3 November. By then it was too late to save the men on the ship. (The Seacrest was unable to receive marine weather forecasts itself because Unocal had previously removed the radio equipment the ship needed to do so. Instead the ship's master got a daily weather fax from Unocal headquarters in Bangkok that was faxed to its company man on board who then gave it to the master. The fax was not a marine weather forecast; it was a general weather report that Unocal picked up each day at the office of the Meteorological Department of Thailand in Bangkok.) Typhoon Gay is known to have passed directly over the Platong Living Quarters and then over the Seacrest. Both reported the calm during the eye of the storm. The Seacrest is known to have capsized after the eye passed over the ship and the weather abruptly turned severe again. At that time, the Seacrest was attached to one of its bow anchors and at least one of the other anchors in its eight anchor drilling mode anchor pattern. One of the survivors testified that moments before the capsize, he had seen the ship's chief engineer at one of the ship's anchor winches. The anchor winch was not working, so the chief engineer was trying to cut through the anchor cable with a fire axe in an apparent attempt to free the ship from the anchor so that it could navigate and steam up the bow anchor cable thereby avoiding wind and waves on its beam. Caught by at least two anchors, the ship was left taking the predominant wind and the waves on its beam. The ship oscillated broadside to the predominant wind, and, during a series of high waves, coupled with gusty typhoon-strength wind, suddenly, but predictably, capsized to port. Typhoon Gay on November 3, just hours before making landfall in the Malay Peninsula Search and rescue Search and rescue efforts were performed by Unocal and the Thai Navy. Unocal did not have a search and rescue plan in place, so it had to improvise its search and rescue efforts. It utilized helicopters, boats, and divers. The wreck, floating inverted approximately four nautical miles from the well site, was found by helicopter on 4 November. Divers were sent to the wreck to locate any crew who might have been trapped within the inverted hull, while supply boats and helicopters continued searching the surrounding sea for any crew who might have drifted away from the wreck. Divers found two bodies on the ship's bridge but no survivors in the capsized ship. By 5 November, Unocal's supply boats and helicopters had searched an area of approximately a 30-mile radius from the Seacrest without finding any survivors. On 5‚Äì6 November, Thai fishing boats and the Thai Navy found six survivors in two groups approximately 62 and 69 miles northwest of the Seacrest. At that time, Unocal redirected its search to that region. An analysis of the survivor drift trajectories was performed through analytical modelling of the wave, wind, and current forces. The analysis was based on hindcast wind, wave, and current data. Results showed that initial drift velocities for survivors in the water were high immediately after the capsize and for the next 24 hours. Within 24 hours the survivors were predicted to have drifted beyond the 30-nautical-mile radius initially searched. Hindsight application of guidelines in the United States' National Search and Rescue Manual failed to accurately predict the actual survivor drift trajectories. Guidelines included in the manual are not applicable to rapidly changing weather such as those present in the vicinity of the eye of a typhoon. Several hindsight studies applying techniques included in this manual failed to predict either the correct drift velocities or direction. Based on this manual, the survivors should have been found within the region searched by UNOCAL, but the only survivors found were the six. Lawsuit against Unocal There are conflicting reports about the cause of the capsize of the Seacrest. The plaintiffs, the four Thai survivors who sued Unocal for personal injuries, and the relatives of lost seamen who sued Unocal for the wrongful death of their loved ones, made essentially two claims as the cause of the survivors' injuries, the loss of loved ones, and the capsize of the Seacrest. First, Unocal was liable because it knew or reasonably should have known from the Thai military broadcasts of its marine forecasts and/or the marine forecasts of MOECO's weather service that an intensifying tropical cyclone was approaching Seacrest in the days before 3 November and, in conformance with industry custom and practice, should have evacuated all nonessential personnel to the nearby Platong platform and had the Seacrest prepared for heavy weather by 2 November. Second, Unocal was liable because Seacrest was in several respects not seaworthy as she lay in her drilling mode anchor moorings with drill pipe in her derrick, and as a result capsized when Typhoon Gay crossed its area of operation on 3 November. The plaintiffs based their claims on information from Unocal, Great Eastern, MOECO, party and non-party witnesses, including the accounts of the four Thai survivors. Unocal and the plaintiffs negotiated the plaintiffs' claims in Houston, Texas and settled the lawsuit. Unocal paid to settle all of the plaintiffs' claims. Because of the settlements there was no trial. As part of Unocal's defense of the lawsuit, Unocal Thailand's legal department hired Failure Analysis Associates, Inc. (FaAA) to perform an investigation and analysis of events related to the loss of the ship. The scope of FaAA's investigation encompassed the analysis of: the physical condition and design of the ship; the weather and its effect on the dynamic response of the ship; the search and rescue effort; and safety training and operating procedures. FaAA did not, however, interview the Thai survivors or rely on their testimony in investigating what had transpired. FaAA also did not consider the marine forecasts broadcast by the Thai military or the marine forecasts of MOECO's weather service. A detailed stability review was performed by FaAA as part of its investigation. It concluded that the ship was designed, built, and operated in accordance with American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) Standards. In 1988, the ship was modified to include a top drive unit. The stability effect of this modification was analyzed by FaAA, and it found that stability improved due to conversion of the No. 3 center tank to permanent ballast as part of the top drive modification. (FaAA never found the alleged ABS calculations and certification of the ship's stability with the top drive.) At the time of the capsize, FaAA reckoned that the ship was operating within accepted stability standards. However, its investigation revealed errors in the wind overturning moment calculations performed by the shipbuilder and approved by ABS. Erroneous instructions in the operator's manual would allow the ship to be operated with the height of the vertical center of gravity above accepted limits, resulting in reduced stability margin. FaAA reported that while this could have been a serious issue in this situation, it was not, since the ship was operating at less than the maximum allowable vertical position of the center of gravity prior to the event. FaAA reported that at the time of the capsize most of the crew were gathered on the main deck aft, near the abandon ship stations. (This was contradicted by the four Thai survivors who described the crew as being in pandemonium in the aft part of the ship because of the typhoon. According to the survivors, it was only the effort of one member of the crew, Kent Nolen, who went down to the aft deck of the ship, took a fire hose, stretched it across the width of the ship and tied it off to make a lifeline for the crew to hold as water from breaking waves washed across deck, that allowed the crew to come out of the aft quarters and stand on deck. Mr. Nolen died on the ship's bridge with the master during the capsize.) FaAA also concluded that the ship appeared to be satisfactorily handling the seas and wind until several larger waves approached the ship and contributed to the capsize. (This is contradicted by the survivors who said the ship had difficulty handling the wind and waves on its beam and capsized as a result.) It is believed that most of the crew were thrown into the sea at the time of the capsize. The result of FaAA's investigation was not surprising. FaAAs's conclusions were that the Seacrest was in satisfactory physical condition and was operating within design limits with regard to weight and stability. Emergency and safety training procedures were in place and drills occurred periodically. FaAA attributed the capsize to the unforeseen elevation of tropical disturbance Gay to typhoon strength in the vicinity of the Seacrest. It said that the combination of severe weather and waves overturned the ship unexpectedly. FaAA also said that forecast information did not indicate the force and location of this storm, thus failing to provide sufficient time to initiate emergency procedures and evacuation of the ship. FaAA deemed the lawsuit invalid.

Biography Touzi Yiqing was born is a city known at the time as Qingshe, which is near the present-day city of Yanshi in Henan Province. An account of his life from the Wudeng Huiyuan (Compendium of Five Lamps), and early 13th century collection of Buddhist biographies, claims he left his parents at the age of seven to study Buddhism at Miaoxing Temple, which was part of the Consciousness-only Sect. Eventually, however, he is said to have found the density of the teachings unhelpful, and so he left to study in the Huayan school instead. While studying in that tradition, he supposedly came to the realization that any attempt to teach Buddhism through the study of words could not succeed. He again left, this time settling on the Zen practitioner Fushan Fayuan, also known as Yuanjian, as his teacher. While Touzi's predecessor was said to be the last remaining teacher in the Caodong/S≈çt≈ç Zen tradition, the lineage flourished with Touzi's devoted students, recovering much of its former prominence. Indirect dharma- transmission Touzi Yiqing is a significant figure in the lineage of Caodong/S≈çt≈ç Zen because he did not actually study under the man commonly regarded as his predecessor, namely Dayang Jingxuan. This is a unique exception to an otherwise steadfast rule that a lineage must involve direct teacher-to-student dharma transmission in order to be considered valid. Juefan Huihong's biographical compilation of 1119, the Chanlin sengbao zhuan (Chronicle of the Sangha Treasure in the Groves of Chan), claims that Touzi Yiqing was the \\"true son\\" of Dayang Jingxuan. The Xudeng lu of 1101 lists Touzi and nine others as disciples of Dayang. However, it also explains that Touzi did not actually ever meet Dayang, let alone receive dharma transmission from him. Instead, Touzi received dharma transmission from Fushan Fayuan, who had been a student of Dayang, but had himself had not received dharma transmission from Dayang either. In fact, Fushan had already received dharma transmission in the Rinzai tradition, and thus could not receive it again. The scholar Morten Schl√ºtter notes that this form of lineage transfer \\"has no real parallel in early Chan literature\\". This refers to the fact that Touzi was able to be considered the immediate heir to Dayang's lineage without having met him, and that Fayuan was able to hold Dayang's lineage \\"in trust\\" without actually being a bona fide heir. Schl√ºtter further interprets Huihong's likely embellished account as an attempt to strengthen the rather weak link between Touzi and Dayang, who was the last Caodong monk recorded in the prestigious Transmission of the Lamp, in order to solidify the legitimacy of the lineage.Schl√ºter, pp.93‚Äì94,210 References Category:Zen Buddhists Category:1032 births Category:1083 deaths Category:Song dynasty Buddhist monks Category:11th-century Chinese people Category:People from Yanshi ","title":"Touzi Yiqing"},{"id":"35457850","text":"‚ÄúSocial Reader‚Äù may refer to the Washington Post Social Reader (formerly available at socialreader.com), or may be used to describe a more general category of social news reading applications.

This is thought to have been caused by a change in how Facebook displayed social reader information. \\"The initial drop was largely the result of a change in the way Facebook displayed social reader stories, which collapsed stories into a smaller, cycling module (the first social readers spit long lists of stories onto users' walls, which was both clumsy and widely reviled).\\" References External links Category:Social networking services Category:Facebook applications ","title":"Social Reader"},{"id":"35457863","text":"The Budapest Museum Quarter is a proposed new cultural and tourist site to be located on Andr√°ssy √∫t in Budapest, Hungary, and has at its core the merger of the Hungarian National Gallery with the Budapest Museum of Fine Arts into one institution. The concept has been around since at least 2008 when the Director of the Museum of Fine Arts proposed combining the two collections. In 2010, the Fidesz political party included the idea in its election campaign. Several other Budapest museums would be affected by the plan, which faces not only economic and legal hurdles, but also criticism from both members of the public and art professionals alike. Aerial picture of Budapest Background =Hungarian national museum system= National museums in Hungary are those institutions that are state‚Äìowned and centrally financed. Many of them were created in the late 19th century under the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy as specialized complementary institutions to the original Hungarian National Museum. Although they received state sponsorship, the museums within this system ‚Äî including the Museum of Natural History, Museum of Ethnography, Museum of Applied Arts, Museum of Fine Arts, the National Gallery and pre‚ÄìWorld War II, the National Library and Archives ‚Äî operated autonomously with their own board and endowment. However, with the introduction of Communism into Hungary in 1949, they lost their autonomy and were governed by the state under the auspices of the Ministry of Education and Culture. Fa√ßade of the Hungarian National Museum The Hungarian National Museum is an important symbol of national identity because it played a major role in the anti- Habsburg Revolution of 1848 when the revolutionaries read their list of twelve demands, as well as a nationalistic poem on its front steps. The site is still used annually by the government to commemorate those events. =Fidesz government (2010)= Cultural policy After winning a two‚Äìthirds parliamentary majority in the 2010 elections, Fidesz or the Hungarian Civic Union party began what was called a \\"hands‚Äìon cultural policy\\" that included appointing a media watchdog \\"that has the power to fine media outlets deemed to violate public interest, order and morals\\". It was suggested by members of the Hungarian art community that the center‚Äìright government was also influencing the appointment of a new director for the Budapest Art Hall (M≈±csarnok) when the prior, Socialist‚Äìappointed incumbent's term ran out at the end of 2010. Francesca Von Habsburg was considered a favorite of the new, conservative government and a front‚Äìrunner in the selection process. However, instead of choosing a candidate from this transparent process launched in November 2010, the Secretary of State for Culture G√©za Sz≈ëcs (a recent Fidesz appointee) personally approved the decision to hire G√°bor Guly√°s, former director of the Centre for Modern and Contemporary Arts (MODEM) in Debrecen, Hungary. In 2011, L√°szl√≥ Harsanyi, the director of the Holocaust Memorial Center and his chief historical adviser, Judit Moln√°r, were both relieved of their posts after the State Secretary for the Ministry of Public Administration and Justice, Andr√°s Levente G√°l, objected to the museum's display of an image of Hungary‚Äôs interwar leader Mikl√≥s Horthy. Saying that \\"this kind of historical inaccuracy [unjustifiably linking Hungary to the deportation of Jews to Nazi concentration camps] creates unnecessary tension,\\" G√°l drew the wrath of dozens of local historians and social scientists. But according to Moln√°r, \\"we could not change the permanent exhibition to align with the new political expectations since we regard that as a falsification of history.\\" A Fidesz party MP and former chairman of the parliamentary cultural and press committee L√°szl√≥ Simon was also appointed to lead the National Cultural Fund of Hungary, which until then had been independent of the government. Other early 2012 replacements included that of Gy≈ërgy Szab√≥, director of Traf√≥ ‚Äî a leading contemporary art center ‚Äî by choreographer Yvette Bozsik, and the director of Budapest‚Äôs √öj Szinh√°z theater, Istv√°n M√°rta by Gy√∂rgy D√∂rner, an actor with extreme right‚Äìwing political affiliations. According to art historian √âva Forg√°cs, ‚Äúthe government wants to disrupt the fabric of Hungarian culture, by having leading cultural figures disappear and replacing them with their own.‚Äù However, Simon dismissed any controversies over his and similar appointments as being politically motivated by the opposition. In 2012, the government decreed that the network of over two hundred county museums that had been in operation for more than a century would fall under the auspices of local city governments. However, the deputy leader of the parliamentary cultural committee Gergely Kar√°csony criticized the decision, arguing that it went against professional standards and that a much better choice would have been unifying the galleries and museums under the Hungarian National Museum system. This would have allowed them to be state-funded, instead of relying on already underfunded local budgets that may lead to the closing of these institutions. Constitutional changes On January 1, 2012, amendments created in the spring of 2011 by Fidesz to the Hungarian Constitution took effect and were not only criticized by many citizens within the country, but also by forces within the European Union and the United States. Some of these changes included \\"a preamble committed to defending the intellectual and spiritual unity of the nation\\", references to previously excluded social issues like the definition of marriage and modifications to the electoral process. Within days, tens of thousands of people marched in protest in Budapest. Initially, the government defended replacing the old Constitution stating that it was \\"high time\\" for the changes to be made. To support his May 2010 remarks that ‚ÄúHungarian culture must be refreshed with works of art, prizes, celebrations‚Äù, as well as publicize the legislative changes, Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n opened a special government‚Äìorganized exhibit at the National Gallery highlighting the sovereign statehood and Christianity within the 1,000 years of Hungarian history. Included in the show, which runs through August 2012, are 15 large, state‚Äìcommissioned works depicting important events from the country's past 150 years, including a canvas of Orb√°n himself. Facing increasing pressure from the EU, by mid‚ÄìJanuary 2012 the Fidesz government had agreed to change parts of the new legislation regarding constitutional changes to the independence of the central bank, the judiciary and data protection. However, they did not agree to change language regarding the cultural components of the proposal. The project =Initial proposals= The concept of a separate museum district within Budapest was a Fidesz campaign platform during the 2010 elections. It included plans for the area from the Western Railway Station to the current Museum of Fine Arts, located on Heroes' Square, to house a newly built Museum of Hungarian Modern Art, as well as a House of Europe for all the countries represented on the continent. The Museum of Ethnography would also be moved to this newly planned district. The project was intended by the party to \\"serve as a cultural‚Äìtouristic‚Äìgastronomic centre with an exhibition and music hall and information centre\\" and be realized over a period of 15 years. The proposal was unveiled by Istv√°n Tarl√≥s, who at the time was chairman of the Fidesz party and who became mayor of Budapest later that same year. Consequently, a consensus developed during a series of professional debates that a museum master plan was essential because there was a real need for: a modern 21st century institution; an emphasis to collect and exhibit 20th century Hungarian art in an international context; and the expansion of media to include architecture, design, photography and media arts. Speculation by the press as to why none of these proposals seemed to get beyond the discussion and debate stage included the observation that \\"the prevailing cultural policy since the political transformation has been to continue with the old model ‚Äî that is, the use of direct control instead of a structural transformation based on dialogue\\". In 2008, the director of the Museum of Fine Arts, L√°szl√≥ Ba√°n, proposed the merging of his museum with that of the National Gallery, due to the similar exhibition and collection profile of the two. Both (along with the Ludwig Museum of Contemporary Art) specialize in 20th century and contemporary fine art, much of which was created by Hungarian artists living overseas. After his request to add an ‚Ç¨18million underground extension to the Museum of Fine Arts ‚Äî which would have united collections spread across the city ‚Äî was denied in February 2011, Ba√°n presented an alternative plan to the government to build two new buildings at the cost of ‚Ç¨150m. He envisioned the new buildings ‚Äî one housing contemporary European art and the other Hungarian photography ‚Äî as a \\"special museum island\\" that would complement the Museum of Fine Arts and the Budapest Art Hall (M≈±csarnok) by permanently joining the two collections by 2017. Interior of the Museum of Fine Arts =Current plans= In September 2011, Secretary of State for Culture G√©za Sz≈ëcs officially announced plans to build a new structure along Andr√°ssy √∫t close to City Park and near the existing Budapest Museum of Fine Arts and Budapest Art Hall (M≈±csarnok). This building would house the collections of the current Hungarian National Gallery. This expanded plan, which would utilize the entire boulevard, is also referred to as the Andr√°ssy Quarter. The project would also involve the addition of a tunnel to redirect existing vehicular traffic, thereby creating a pedestrian‚Äìonly zone that hasn't existed on Andr√°ssy √∫t since the late nineteenth century. In addition to other new venues for eating and entertainment on Andr√°ssy √∫t, there would also be changes made to City Park. One of these would be to rename the Hungarian State Circus after Harry Houdini, whose background as a Hungarian was relatively unknown even though he was world famous. This version of the project would take eight years and cost 20 billion HUF. After submission of a detailed proposal to the cabinet (expected in summer 2012), construction could begin by 2014. The architectural design for this \\"New Gallery\\" will be chosen based on an international competition. =Appointments and resignations= According to the Hungarian News Agency (MTI), on October 1, 2011 L√°szl√≥ Ba√°n was appointed to a two‚Äìyear term as the government commissioner in charge of developing the new museum quarter, in addition to his existing position as director of the Museum of Fine Arts. In his new post, Ba√°n will report directly to the Prime Minister, but will not get additional pay. He will be responsible for ‚Äúpreparing the concept, execution and architectural design‚Äìtender for a building complex to house the national public collection in Budapest‚Äôs 56‚Äìers Square, with a special focus on merging the collections of the Museum of Fine Arts and the Hungarian National Gallery\\". Ba√°n has faced criticism before from both other institutions and interest groups, having radically transformed his museum from 2004 onward from one of relative obscurity to being an extensive contributor of loans to major international exhibits. While his process of fast modernization and innovation was supported by the government, it went against the typical standard of slow (or even non- existent) change in non‚Äìcontemporary, eastern European museums. In early December 2011, Ferenc Cs√°k ‚Äî director of the Hungarian National Gallery since 2010 and critical of the proposed merger of the gallery with the Museum of Fine Arts‚Äî called the merge process ‚Äú[v]ery unprofessional, anti‚Äìdemocratic and short‚Äìsighted‚Äù and announced that he would resign at the end of 2011. As of March 5, 2012, a new director had not been named and the Hungarian National Gallery was being led by Deputy General Director Gy√∂rgy Sz≈±cs. Protests and opposition =Political= This is not the first time that a recent Hungarian government has proposed the integration of multiple public institutions into one location. The plan is similar to that of the Government District which was to be built in generally the same area of Budapest behind the Western Railway Station in 2009 under the direction of then Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcs√°ny. However, that proposal ‚Äî which was touted by the government as a green initiative to save on resources ‚Äî was scrapped in early 2008 due to the enormous projected costs of rebuilding the infrastructure around the area. 2012 Pro Government demonstration There was speculation by historian Andr√°s Ger≈ë that Fidesz's recent policy changes stem from its staunch anti‚Äìcommunist stance, which \\"is not blindly ideological but driven by cold political calculation\\". The resignation of former National Gallery director Ferenc Cs√°k was partly motivated by the Fidesz government's exhibition Heroes, Kings, Saints. Images and Documents from the History of Hungary which he criticized by saying, ‚ÄúThe government shouldn‚Äôt have the power to order exhibitions with such a high political agenda. Museums shouldn‚Äôt be getting involved in politics.‚Äù Moving the collections of the National Gallery to a new location would leave the Buda Castle empty and available for other use. Although the government has made it clear that they will move out of the Parliament building by 2014, officials have not stated whether it is their intention to move government offices ‚Äî including that of the Prime Minister ‚Äî into the Castle once it is vacant. Buda Castle ‚Äî current home of the National Gallery =Economic= In November 2011, Hungary was downgraded to junk status by one of the big international rating agencies. In spite of this, several major projects are planned for Budapest within the next few years, including that of the Museum Quarter. Addressing criticism regarding the timing of such an expensive project with a weak economic situation, L√°szl√≥ Ba√°n defended the Hungarian government's plans by saying that they are \\"making use of various instruments for dealing with the critical economic situation, many of which are surprising, unusual and, for that very reason, ferociously debated.\\" However, he also added that \\"it fits perfectly with the logic of this government to launch a cultural mega‚Äìproject of such emblematic significance right in the middle of general budget cuts: one which, besides its intrinsic value, also expresses an extremely important symbolic message\\". =Legal= There is also a legal hurdle to the various construction plans because of the existing zoning restrictions in the proposed location for the new buildings. The developed area within the City Park is already five percent over the allowable two percent limit, and this includes the site chosen by the government for the new museum. The zoning laws are reviewed every five or ten years; thereby any current plans would be considered illegal. =Social= In addition to opposition to the merging of the museums, the establishment of the museum quarter by forcing cars off Andr√°ssy √∫t also received criticism. Arguments included the fact that the scale of the massive boulevard is much too large to be restricted to only pedestrians and the wide, tree‚Äìlined sidewalks that exist are already adequate. Many of the shops along the route are also empty ‚Äî a sign of the current status of the Hungarian economy ‚Äî and would not make for a welcome sight to targeted tourists. Andr√°ssy √∫t in Budapest Art professionals have criticized L√°szl√≥ Ba√°n's capacity to lead an endeavor to unite two such massive museums because he is not an art historian nor a museologist, but rather an economist by training. They fear that a merge would potentially damage Hungarian cultural heritage, both literally and figuratively. Additionally, leading Hungarian art historians worry that the physical move of such a large and valuable collection as that of the National Gallery is unprofessional and irresponsible. Between December 17, 2011 and the deadline for the merge on February 29, 2012 an online petition entitled \\"Protest Against the Merger of the Hungarian National Gallery and the Museum of Fine Arts\\" that was created by these individuals had received 2,945 signatures. On October 25, 2011 the Hungarian Section of the International Association of Art Critics (AICA) published their similar standpoint regarding the issue and also supported the on‚Äìline petition. Ba√°n dismissed these criticisms by reminding the Hungarian members of AICA that he was hired to conduct the necessary impact studies and hold discussions with key stakeholders in the next two years in order to address their concerns. He also stressed that the National Gallery would not cease to exist, but only that its collections would be relocated to return it to its pre‚Äì1957 state and give it more prominence. Similar places worldwide Despite all of the challenges and the opposition to the planned Budapest Museum Quarter, creating unified spaces is not unheard of, as there are other major cities worldwide which have successfully created cultural and tourist centers by clustering museums and other similar attractions in one location. =Europe= The Museumplein of Amsterdam ‚Äî a spacious square with a pond and park frequently used for outdoor festivals and events ‚Äî lies in the heart of the museum quarter in Amsterdam surrounded by the Rijksmuseum, the Van Gogh Museum, the Stedelijk and the Concertgebouw. Five institutions that are all part of the Berlin State Museums are located on the northern half of an island in the Spree River in Berlin, Germany and make up what is referred to as Museum Island. More than a dozen museums in Frankfurt, Germany are clustered along the banks of the Main River in an area known as the Museumsufer. Opened in 2001, the Museum Quarter in Vienna is one of the world's largest complexes for modern art and culture, encompassing nine permanent museums, exhibition halls, and creativity space for the dozens of culture initiatives based in the area. It is also home to restaurants, caf√©s and shops, attracting about 3.8 million visitors a year. It was created in order to coordinate the work of various museums after the establishment of a federal museum law. MuseumsQuartier Vienna =North America= Chicago's Museum Campus, which houses the Shedd Aquarium, Field Museum, Adler Planetarium, and Soldier Field, came to be in 1998 when the area next to Lake Michigan was replanned and landscaped with the intention of tying the institutions together with the use of green space. The Dallas Arts District was proposed in 1978 and the first major museum to be located in the northeast corner of downtown was the Dallas Museum of Art, opened in 1984. Since then, the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center, the Crow Collection of Asian Art, the Nasher Sculpture Center, the Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, and the AT&T; Performing Arts Center have all been moved or newly built in the area. In 2012, the City Performance Hall will complete the planned additions to the district. The Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth metroplex contains another cluster of cultural sites at the Fort Worth Cultural District. It is not only home to five museums such as the Kimbell Art Museum, National Cowgirl Museum and the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History, but the overall park-like setting also contains the local performing arts centers like symphony, ballet and theater. The pedestrian‚Äìfriendly Museum District in Houston, Texas links 18 cultural institutions and attracts 8.7 million visitors each year. It is home to such facilities as the Buffalo Soldiers National Museum, the Children's Museum of Houston, the Museum of Fine Arts and the Contemporary Arts Museum of Houston, along with restaurants, shops and offices. Exposition Park in Los Angeles contains several sporting venues, museums and recreational facilities within its 60 acres. Visitors will find the LA Coliseum and Memorial Sports Arena, as well as the Natural History Museum, California Science Center and African American Museum alongside the Expo Center. The National Mall is a central green space in Washington, DC that is defined by the structures of the US Capitol on one end and the Jefferson Memorial on the other. Between these two points, visitors will find numerous memorials and monuments, as well as many museums belonging to the world- renowned Smithsonian Institution including the Quadrangle Museums Project, designed in 1987. It opens south from the Smithsonian Castle building and contains two small buildings which are staging areas for two underground museums, the Sackler Gallery of Asian Art, and the National Museum of African Art, and another smaller kiosk‚Äìlike building which provides the entrance for the S. Dillon Ripley Center. Related issues In addition to criticism surrounding the proposed Museum Quarter and the recent changes in leadership for key Hungarian cultural institutions, there are several other significant issues that affect the country's cultural heritage management. =Kossuth Square= A new controversy has erupted over the plans to restore the Kossuth Square in front of the Parliament building. The changes would include the removal of all monuments added since 1945 and replacing them with pre‚Äì1944 sculptures. In this plan, a 1980 sculpture of one of the greatest Hungarian poets, Attila J√≥zsef would be replaced by a monument of one‚Äìtime prime minister Gyula Andr√°ssy. Not everyone is overly worried about the government's actions, though. For example, artist Mikl√≥s Sz≈±ts believes that \\"the government might make symbolic gestures, like the paintings they commissioned, but they don‚Äôt have a major effect in reality.‚Äù However, the Socialist opposition planted a tree on Earth Day 2012 at the end of the square in protest of the government's undemocratic actions of modifying the space \\"without asking the people\\". In addition to the statues of Kossuth Square being in danger, the fate of the Ethnographic Museum that is across from the Parliament building is also uncertain because the newly reinstated Hungarian Supreme Court (K√∫ria) has recently expressed interest in getting its former building back. According to the local newspaper N√©pszava, just moving the museum, as well as the Institute of Political History that also occupies the same building, would cost at least 5 billion HUF, but constructing new premises for both would take at least 15 billion HUF, if not double the amount\\". =Natural History Museum= In mid‚Äì2011, the Hungarian Natural History Museum was threatened with eviction from its building (known as the Ludovika Campus), which it received after the fall of communism in 1989. The government wanted to turn the premises into a university for the military or police, similar to its function prior to 1945, and thereby relocate the 70 staff and 10 million artifacts into a yet undecided space. A few days after this news, the government's Office of Public Affairs issued a joint press release with the museum that addressed the issue. They explained that in spite of two decades of effort, the museum still operates in three separate locations. Additionally, the move of the proposed National Civil Servant University into unutilized space in the Ludovika Campus would make it possible for the museum to receive additional space elsewhere, thereby improving its current situation by reducing the number of sites where it operates. The museum would keep the current space in the Ludovika's former stables and the underground rooms that it uses. The museum's leadership would also take part in the preparatory work regarding the renovations of the Ludovika Campus. Long‚Äìterm plans involve moving the Hungarian Natural History Museum to the completed Museum Quarter. Kr√°sna H√¥rka Castle before the fire of 2012 =Hopp Southeast Asia Museum= A private collection exhibiting almost 1,000 artifacts opened on Andr√°ssy √∫t in September 2011 as part of the new Southeast Asian Gold Museum. One source of contention among its critics is that the Ministry of Culture approved the title of \\"museum\\" without the usual requirements for records of the origin of the exhibits. The collection is both complementary to and competition of the existing Ferenc Hopp Southeast Asian Museum in Budapest, which the owner and curator of the new Gold Museum Istv√°n Zelnik had been interested in acquiring since 2008. However, the leadership of the latter (which belongs under the umbrella of the Budapest Museum of Applied Arts) blocked his advances. Currently, the future of both the Hopp Museum and its sister institution the Gy√∂rgy R√°th Museum is uncertain. Owing to financial constraints, they are both only open for half‚Äìdays on Friday through Sunday. There are also rumors within the Hungarian press that both museums are due to close on March 31, 2012 and that their collections are to be permanently transferred to the Museum of Applied Arts as a response to the Hopp Museum's previous bids for independent status under the auspices of the National Trust for Monuments (MNG). =Kr√°sna H√¥rka Castle= While Kr√°sna H√¥rka Castle is a National Cultural Monument of the Slovak Republic, it was built and inhabited by ethnic Hungarian families and was part of the Kingdom of Hungary until 1918. However, a massive blaze on March 10, 2012 destroyed much of the building and up to 10% of its historical collections. Fidesz's commitment to the preservation of Hungary's cultural heritage may be tested based on their response to the request for aid from the Hungarian Coalition Party of Slovakia to rebuild the thirteenth-century fortress, but the initial statement of the Hungarian Prime Minister was that the nation is prepared to assist with saving this priceless cultural asset.

The list is compiled by Toronto-based media and investment advisory firm, Corporate Knights (CK). Each year, the latest iteration of the index is announced at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. From inception (February 1, 2015) to December 31, 2018, the Global 100 made a net investment return of 127.35%, compared to 118.27% from the MSCI All Country World Index (ACWI). History The Global 100 was created by Corporate Knights Magazine in 2005. The goal of creating the index was to devise a methodology to quantitatively compare and rank the world‚Äôs largest public companies. Methodology The Global 100 uses a purely quantitative methodology to determine inclusion in the ranking. The Global 100 starting universe automatically considers all firms with a market capitalization of at least US$2 billion. The firms are then put through numerous screenings to test for key information, including; overall sustainability disclosure rate and sustainability disclosure rate versus GICS sector peers, a financially based Piotroski F-score to ensure financial stability, and fines, penalties or settlements paid out by the company for sustainability related violations. Companies in the GICS sub-industry categories of tobacco and those engaged primarily in defence are eliminated.http://global100.org/methodology/ The initial screening process culminates in the Global 100 shortlist. At this point, companies are compared on priority key performance indicators (KPIs), according to GICS sector. Priority indicators are chosen based on the percentage of firms in the sector who disclose the indicator. If less than 10% disclose, than the indicator will not be considered a priority KPI for that sector. There are a maximum of 12 KPIs used in the ranking, they are: * Energy Productivity * Carbon Productivity * Water Productivity * Waste Productivity * Innovation Capacity * Percentage Tax Paid * CEO to Average Worker Pay * Pension Fund Status * Safety Performance * Employee Turnover * Leadership Diversity * Clean Capitalism Pay Link Each KPI is weighted equally and companies are given an overall percentage score. Failure to disclose a priority KPI will result in a zero, thus severely punishing firms for non- disclosure. Accolades The Global 100 Index has been recognized as a leader in transparency and industry best practices for sustainability rankings, according to SustainAbility‚Äôs Rate the Raters project.http://www.sustainability.com/projects/rate-the-raters#projtab-6 See also * Corporate Knights * corporate social responsibility * Dow Jones Sustainability Index * FTSE4Good Index * green company * greenwashing References External links *http://www.global100.org/ *http://www.corporateknights.com *http://www.corporateknightscapital.com Category:International sustainable development ","title":"The Global 100"},{"id":"35457962","text":"Upworthy is a website dedicated to positive storytelling. It was started in March 2012 by Eli Pariser, the former executive director of MoveOn, and Peter Koechley, the former managing editor of The Onion. One of Facebook's co- founders, Chris Hughes, was an early investor. In 2017, the company was acquired by Good Worldwide. Between the two platforms, they reached 100MM people a month. Upworthy's stated mission is \\"to change what the world pays attention to.\\"http://www.upworthy.com/about It uses virality to promote stories that remind people of their shared humanity. History In June 2013, an article in Fast Company called Upworthy \\"the fastest growing media site of all time\\". In August 2013 the site became the first \\"non-traditional\\" site to feature in NewsWhip's Top Ten Publisher Rankings, in fifth place. By November 2013 they were the third most social publisher on Facebook, despite their low article count. The site popularized a distinctive style of two-phrase headlines, which has spread to many other websites. It has been criticized for its use of overly sensationalized, emotionally manipulative, \\"clickbait\\" style, headlines as well as having a liberal bias, and simplifying issues that are controversial by nature. Since 2015, under the site's new editorial director, Amy O'Leary (who joined the site from The New York Times in February, 2015) it has been focussing more on producing original content, rather than aggregating third-party content. This resulted in six of its staff being laid off as well as new staff being hired. Upworthy was accused of laying off one round of writers in 2015, and another in 2016, after a unionization effort by some of the staff. The union involved, the Writers Guild of America East, has organized several online \\"viral\\" news publishers. In January 2017, Upworthy was acquired by Good Worldwide, a company that similarly focused on spreading progressive messages through their websites such as good.is. The newsrooms of the two organizations would merge as part of the acquisition. About 20 staffers were laid off as part of the merger. An October 2017 article in AdExchanger described the merger as successful in helping the joint entity achieve profitability. =Funding= Upworthy has been through two rounds of funding. In October 2012 it raised $4 million from New Enterprise Associates and other angel investors, including BuzzFeed co- founder John Johnson, Facebook co-founder and New Republic owner Chris Hughes, and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. In September 2013 it raised $8 million from investors Catamount Ventures, Spark Capital, Knight Foundation and Klee Irwin. Content Upworthy writers and video staff produce daily stories, which are distributed on social media. Topics include \\"Being a Better Human,\\" \\"Citizenship & Democracy,\\" \\"Culture,\\" \\"Identities,\\" and \\"Science & Technology.\\" =Views= In November 2013, Upworthy hit a high of over 80 million unique visitors for the month. However, in early 2014 it had fallen to roughly 20 million unique visitors. As of December 2014, Upworthy's mission statement says it engages a total of about 50 million people each month. As of October 2016, Upworthy's YouTube channel has 157,370 subscribers and has had over 10 million views. By October 2018 the channel had 163,154 subscribers and over 14 million views. =Advertising= Upworthy has been labeled a \\"clickbait shop\\"; however, for two years Upworthy did not monetize clicks through display advertising. The company began making money in April 2014 with the announcement of Upworthy Collaborations. As of 2016, Upworthy also relies on traditional advertising with AdSense. Upworthy Collaborations is a name given to Upworthy's advertising partnerships with corporations. It includes native ads, and articles that its advertising partners underwrite. It is selective with the organizations it collaborates with and states that \\"We draw a line on greenwashing\\". Upworthy states that it wishes to work with corporations who have a common mission and similar values. Peter Koechley said on the topic: \\"We won‚Äôt take an ad from Exxon claiming to be good for the environment, but Skype claiming they help people communicate‚Äîthat seems about right\\". It has attracted prominent brands such as Unilever, Skype, CoverGirl, and charities such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

During World War II, Kandolathon Uljayeva met her future husband in Ukraine. Ibrahim Tadjibayev was a soldier of the Soviet Army. They married in 1944 and their first son was born in Ukraine. Although Mutabar Tadjibayeva was not eyewitness of those events, her mother's memories played a significant role in her maturing as a human rights defender.

At the same time, on a voluntary basis, Tadjibayeva was in charge of the complaint department and the press centre of the institution in question. Within this organization she took an active part in monitoring the implementation of laws and human rights. There for the first time Mutabar Tadjibayeva personally saw the efficiency of public relations. As a designated employee of the press centre, she also took an active part in agitation and propaganda activities concerning the implementation of laws approved by the Uzbek government. Tadjibayeva started to declaim against the executives abusing their authority and rights of simple citizens in the central and local press. This work influenced in a significant way on her maturing as a human rights activist. In 1991 as a result of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Public Control Committee was dissolved as well. And till 1997 Mutabar Tadjibayeva continued her activity in the banking industry, including the position of the Head of Human Resources, the economist of currency circulation department, the Chief economist at the Industrial and Construction Bank of Uzbekistan and the Public bank of Kirguliysky district. From 1997 to 1998 she headed agitation and propaganda centre of the Union of Writers of Ferghana district. Tadjibayeva published her first brochure ‚Äò‚ÄôMemory‚Äô‚Äô. At the same time she continued her human rights activity and issued her critical materials in the republican media. From 1998 to 1999 Tadjibayeva held an appointment as a Deputy Head of Department of Ferghana region at the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. Human rights activity In the elections in December 1999, Mutabar Tadjibayeva was a candidate for deputy to the Regional Council of Fergana. She pursued bringing to the agenda the passage of the law concerning the organization of public control of the legislative acts implementation. However, Tadjibayeva failed to break through in the elections. For realization of her plans she became a member of the People's Democratic Party of Uzbekistan (PDPU). In January 2000, Mutabar Tadjibayeva was elected secretary of the PDPU party unit of Margilan called ‚Äò‚ÄôZukhro‚Äô‚Äô. There she founded the ‚Äò‚ÄôFiery Hearts Club‚Äô‚Äô. The event can be considered as her official entry to the human rights field. With the support of the ‚Äò‚ÄôFiery Hearts Club‚Äô‚Äôa brochure called ‚Äò‚ÄôLet Us Be Vigilant‚Äô‚Äô was published in 2001. In January 2002, at the plenary session of the municipal council of Margilan two-year activity of the ‚Äò‚ÄôFiery Hearts Club‚Äô‚Äô was discussed. The plenum positively appreciated the club‚Äôs progresses in crime and drug abuse fighting and adopted a resolution on popularization the club‚Äôs practices throughout the Republic. Subsequently, articles, feature stories, special reports about the club‚Äôs activity were issued in the local and republican media.  Alimuhammad Mamadaliev's case and its consequences In 2002 Mutabar Tadjibayeva was monitoring the case of Alimuhammad Mamadaliev, tortured and killed by special services. She took an active part in informing a wide public about the drama. As a result the case was examined by the Military Court of the Republic of Uzbekistan. Merders of Mamadaliev were convicted to heavy terms of imprisonment. On June 30, 2002, Mutabar Tadjibayeva together with Scott Peterson, a correspondent of the international newspaper ‚Äò‚ÄôChristian Science Monitoring‚Äô‚Äô, visited Durmen village, where Mamadaliev‚Äôs family lived. They were carrying out journalistic investigation and questioning villagers about local administrative authorities‚Äô threats. The next day, on July 1, 2002, traffic police of Kirgulijsky district pulled over Tadjibayeva's car and arrested her. They grilled and humbled Mutabar Tadjibayeva without formal procedure. She was brought to the department of internal affairs and placed in a basement cell. That night internal affairs officers raped her. The next day Tadjibayeva was accused in breaching the articles ‚Äò‚ÄôFailure to obey order or regulation issued by a police officer‚Äô‚Äô and ‚Äò‚ÄôDisorderly conduct‚Äô‚Äô. Due to the lack of accusatory documents presented to the court as well as Mutabar Tadjibayeva‚Äôs claims to arrange medico-legal assessment, the case was transferred to the Public Prosecutor's Office and she was released from the courtroom. On September 5, 2002, the Criminal Court of Fergana region recognized illegal the actions of Kirgulijsky district officers. On September 27, the Public Prosecutor's Office of Kirgulijsky district initiated criminal proceedings. However, on December 16, 2002, the case was dismissed ‚Äò‚Äôin the absence of crime in the acts of the officers‚Äô‚Äô. Mamadaliev‚Äôs case aggravated the confrontation between Tadjibayeva and the authorities. Due to that event, the ‚Äò‚ÄôFiery Hearts Club‚Äô‚Äô and its leader gained even higher authority among people and that caused the increase in their activity. Aggravation of the situation On October 14, 2002, on Mutabar Tadjibayeva‚Äôs initiative there was held a picket in front of the Crime Court of Alty-Aryksky district. On November 7, 2002, she made public an official demand on behalf of the ‚Äò‚ÄôFiery Hearts Club‚Äô‚Äô, for the manifestation that was going to be held on November 8 in front of the building of the Parliament against the violation of citizens‚Äô constitutional rights. She sent her leaflet to all the administrative authorities. The Prosecutor General's Office executive Bakhadyr Pulatov came to Ferghana region to check the arguments of the demand and met Tadjibayeva. However, he didn't complete the inspection and left for Tashkent. 4 days before the demonstration Tadjibayeva was summoned to the prosecutor of Ferghana Talib Khasanov who insisted on the demonstration to be cancelled otherwise he threatened to initiate criminal proceedings against Tadjibayeva and delivered her a warning letter. When Mutabar Tadjibayeva refused the letter the prosecutor send her the second warning. The document warned her against continuation of the ‚Äò‚ÄôFiery Hearts Club‚Äô‚Äô activity otherwise another criminal case would be initiated against her. On December 5, 2002, Tadjibayeva got a call from the Ferghana region Department of internal affairs. She was informed about legal proceedings initiated, but didn't present herself in the court. On December 6, Mutabar was informed that she had to present herself in the court, otherwise it would be done by enforcement. After making sure the case had been faked-up against the planned demonstration, Tadjibayeva decided not to present herself in the court and hid in Durmen. The same evening police officers, special services and militaries surrounded Durmen. They explained to the villagers that Mutabar Tadjibayeva was a western agent and demanded her extradition. However, nobody supported the public officers, so they started conducting a search. On December 10, 2002, Mutabar Tadjibayeva found out that aiming to bring pressure on her, the police officers were planning to take her daughter hostage. So disguised as an old woman Mutabar left the village. Then she called to the Internal Affairs Department of Ferghana region and expressed her will to succumb to the authorities in return of abatement of persecution and pressure. Car accident At the beginning of December 2003, one of high officials of the Internal Affairs Department of Ferghana region called Tadjibayeva in sozzled state and told her that she would be punished for her actions and that her days had been already numbered. On December 12, Mutabar Tadjibayeva came to the Ministry of Interior of the Republic of Uzbekistan and demanded the abatement of persecution against her. However, the agency's chief executives refused to receive her. The next day on her way to Ferghana region Mutabar Tadjibayeva had a car accident and spent 12 days in hospital. According to Mutabar, that was not a simple accident as she was the only victim and it happened after the phone call with threats. As the car accident took place in Tashkent region, Tadjibayeva was taken to the hospital in Akhangaransky district. The victim wasn't informed about the results of criminal proceedings initiated over the accident. Her demands to see the documents concerning the case were not satisfied. Tadjibayeva came back to Margilan and continued medical treatment there. Later she got to know that her medical papers had been destroyed by fire of unknown origin. Andijan events On April 4, 2005, Mutabar Tadjibayeva sent a telegram to the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan Islam Karimov on behalf of the ‚Äò‚ÄôFiery Hearts Club‚Äô‚Äô expounding a difficult socio-political situation in Andijan region. On April 13, she was detained by police officers of Bektemirsky district, later transferred to the Internal Affairs Department and interrogated. Under the pressure of international NGOs as well as foreign embassies, Mutabar was released. On April 15, 2005, in the Ministry of Internal of the Republic of Uzbekistan there was held a press conference concerning published under the pseudonym of the political scientist Safar Abdulaev. Mutabar Tadjibayeva wanted to participate in the conference, but on her way to the conference, she was stopped by traffic police and taken away by unknown individuals in another car. After having changed several cars, she was brought to the Internal Affairs Department of Bektemirsky district. There Mutabar was subject to a stern interrogation and humiliation. Back to Margilan Tadjibayeva got under medical treatment in a local hospital, however she didn't turn to anybody concerning the violences and tortures that she had undergone. That was because the high official that was in charge of Tadjibayeva's detention as well as mockery at her, told her to keep silence, otherwise he threatened to make her daughter experience the same adventure as hers. During the events in Andijan on May 13, 2005, Mutabar Tadjibayeva was placed under house arrest for no reason. There were two armed police officers watching her dwelling. In such conditions, Mutabar achieved to relate the participants of Andijan events with international journalists. The same day at about 5 pm, chief executives of the Counter-Terrorism Department under the Internal Affairs Department of Ferghana region ordered to transfer Tadjibayeva to the regional Internal Affairs Department. She was detained till May 16, 2005 and prohibited to contact with anybody. Arrest During the legal proceedings concerning the Andijan events initiated on September 20, 2005, the Deputy Solicitor General of the Republic accused Tadjibayeva of anti-government activity under the false name of a human rights activist. Mutabar Tadjibayeva was invited to an international conference on human rights protection in Dublin fixed on October 8, 2005. She was expected to make a speech at the conference on the Andijan events. However, on October 7, 2005, Mutabar Tadjibayeva was arrested by security officers of the Ministry of Interior of Uzbekistan on a charge of deceptive practices. After the arrest the house of Tadjibayeva was searched and her personal affairs were confiscated. Despite the fact that only Mutabar Tadjibaeva in person was incriminated, the members of the ‚Äò‚ÄôFiery Hearts Club‚Äô‚Äô were searched as well, besides all the documents and materials (videotapes, audio cassettes, etc.) were confiscated too. For 10 days Mutabar was being detained in temporary detention facilities of Ferghana region. Later on, she was kept in other pretrial detention facilities for 4 months and underwent numerous interrogations. During the investigation Mutabar had finally learnt the reasons of her arrest. It was human rights activity against the interests of administrative officials and the ‚Äò‚ÄôFiery Hearts Club‚Äôs‚Äô‚Äô governing.

It extends from the juncture with National Route 40 in Tecka to the bridge on the Chubut River in the city of Rawson. The highway crosses the Patagonian Steppe, joining sparsely populated areas. History This route was established by the Tehuelche people to journey between the coasts in the winter and the Andes in the summer. The route borders the Chubut River, which is the only source of potable water on the journey. After the establishment of Welsh colonies in the valley below, and encouraged by news sent from the Andes by Wisel (also spelled Huisel, Wissale or Wishel) and then by other caciques, John Daniel Evans ventured on this route in late 1885 together with Governor Luis Jorge Fontana in an expedition called Riflemen of Chubut (Rifleros del Chubut). Years later and after a second expedition, Evans guided the first group of colonists to definitively establish themselves in the mountain range, linking the coast and the October 16 Colony (Colonia 16 de Octubre) (renamed Trevelin in 1918) on November 20, 1888. The crossing of the Chubut River was made by raft until the construction of a bridge in 1957-1958.

Hutcheson ‚Äì Gordon Ramsay's former business partner and father-in-law ‚Äì gained an injunction but it was later partially lifted, and ultimately overturned in the Court of Appeal, with Hutcheson being publicly named by the judge.  Background  Hutcheson had sued anonymously to prevent publication of the material; the interim injunction he received was to run either until after the eventual court hearing, or until a time otherwise determined by the court. In the event, Hutcheson and the publisher reached a mutual compromise: the latter would not print, and the former would drop their suit. The following year, however, News Group Newspapers, wishing to publish the original material in The Sun, applied to have the 2009 injunction set aside. The newspaper claimed to have evidence that Hutcheson was using money from Ramsay's business to support a second family. Mr Justice Eady, sitting in camera in December 2010, stated that Hutcheson ‚Äì called KGM due to the reporting restrictions imposed ‚Äì could not \\"rely on the law of privacy\\" to protect his personal life, and stated that the 2009 injunction had expired with the parties' self-arbitration. Eady said that Hutcheson ' threw away his right to keep his strange double life secret when he entered into a slanging match' with Ramsay, and that as a result of the WER v R.W compromise, Hutcheson had been effectively \\"sitting on an interim injunction as though it gave the permanence and security of a final injunction.\\" However, the judge made no comment on the accuracy of The Sun's original allegations.  Hutcheson's appeal  Eady's judgement, however, could not be reported by the UK press until the following year as a result of Hutcheson appealing to the Court of Appeal; Hutcheson's solicitor argued that, whilst his client's behaviour \\"might well be said to be morally blameworthy\\" it was in no way criminal. In their judgement, the Appeal Court upheld Eady's ruling, saying that, just because information was related to private life, \\"it did not necessarilly follow that there was a reasonable expectation of privacy.\\" The case has, in part, been summarised as demonstrating that if a person quarrels in public, the boundary between public and private 'will blur' legally. The judges named 'KGM' as Hutcheson, and soon after ruled that their judgement could be published in almost its entirety. Details of the case subsequently appeared in the Daily Mail and The Sun, and The Daily Telegraph subsequently reported that Hutcheson had fathered two children in the course of his affair.  Legal significance  The case is one of several so-called superinjunctions dealing with the English common law position in relation to privacy and social media. Here, the Court of Appeal offered guidance on the conditions in which permission to appeal would be granted where it was only of academic importance, laying down three requirements: that the appeal could raise significant questions, that the defendant not be adversely affected by it, and that a full hearing would be open to all concerned parties. The Guardian described the outcome of the case as \\"a further setback to the power of privacy orders to restrict reporting,\\" coming as it did the day after Ryan Giggs was named in Parliament as also having brought a similar injunction over allegations of an affair.

It was popularized by the book Purple Cow: Transform Your Business by Being Remarkable by Seth Godin. The phenomenon is an extension of marketing, which describes the generation of consumer interest or inquiry into products or services of a business. Traditionally, businesses have generated customers using the techniques of Internet marketing, such as search engine marketing (SEM), search engine optimisation (SEO), banner ads on specific websites, email marketing, and mobile advertising. Social media companies such as Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest, by contrast, do not rely on these tools to generate user attention. User-generated content makes up the majority content on these sites; users therefore view content on the sites according to what interests them most. This behaviour collapses the traditional barriers between content, distribution and marketing, as any activity on a social media site effectively achieves all these three functions simultaneously.  Business opportunity  Rather than interrupting users' attention in order to market to them, the business opportunity available to social media is in capturing people‚Äôs attention and channeling this attention to an appropriate vendor when it presents itself as a genuine desire to buy. Previously, it was very difficult and expensive for business to market themselves on anything other than a mass, or broadcast basis. Targeting messages to individuals, at any kind of effective scale, was all but impossible. But social media has changed that. By using social media channels to target according to users' attention, business and other organisations can make their messages far more relevant and appropriate to individual consumers. For businesses to suddenly shift commercial focus from the mass attention of a broad audience to the particular attention of individuals, however, requires a complete change of corporate mindset. Inside media and marketing organisations, content production, distribution and marketing have traditionally occupied different - and usually warring - silos. Because of the intimate connection between the content and the opportunity to create a lead, however, attention marketing necessarily collapses these silos and brings them together.

The series is written by Brian Michael Bendis and illustrated by Sara Pichelli. It marks the first time that characters from the original Marvel Universe and the Ultimate Universe have crossed over since the latter debuted in 2000. Plot While out web- swinging, Spider-Man sees a brilliant purple light from a distant warehouse, and investigates it to find Mysterio ranting about how he missed out on one chance to kill Spider-Man already. Although Spider-Man quickly defeats him, when examining Mysterio's equipment, he is shot at by Mysterio, causing him to fall through the rift created by the equipment. When he regains consciousness, he discovers that it is daylight. After interrupting a mugging, Peter is confused when the would-be victim informs him that, while he is grateful for the rescue, it might be disrespectful to be seen wearing Peter Parker's suit after his death. Swinging away to think about what he has just heard, Spider- Man runs into another Spider-Man on a rooftop. Angered at Spider-Man ruining his plans again, Mysterio activates a robotic avatar and sends it after Peter. Back in the new universe, Peter fights with the other Spider-Man, but his superior experience and training is outmaneuvered by Miles' new powers, culminating in Peter being knocked out by Miles using his venom sting. Waking up in a cell, Peter meets this world's Nick Fury and explains his theory that he is from another universe, which Fury accepts as nobody would come up with something that ridiculous as a lie. Fury sends Peter away with Miles to explain this world's history to him. Just as Peter asks Miles if his counterpart is dead in this world, they are attacked by Mysterio's avatar. Both Spider-Men face off against Mysterio's Avatar. Due to Miles' lack of experience, he is easily thrown back into Peter, and they both end up in the East River. Mysterio deploys weapons that create the illusion of a mob of Spider-Man's enemies from both realities attacking them. Peter figures out the trick and demands Mysterio return him to his home universe. Mysterio decides to instead strand Peter in a world where he is believed to be dead. The avatar self-destructs, rendering Miles unconscious; when he wakes, the Ultimates and Nick Fury are on the scene. While his version of Tony Stark works on deciphering Mysterio's dimension technology, Miles asks where Peter went. Fury surmises that he went off to find out the truth about his alternate self. Peter goes to the location where his apartment in his home universe is supposed to be. Peter finds it to be converted into a store, and after stopping a robbery, he questions the cashier. He is shocked to find out that the Peter Parker of this world died in battle and that the city is still mourning, and that it is also common knowledge that Peter Parker was Spider- Man. Distraught over the news, he swings over to Queens where the Parker residence is currently up for sale. May Parker is seeing off Gwen Stacy to school. When they see Peter in his costume, they believe he is a lunatic disrespecting the memory of the deceased Peter Parker, and are shocked beyond words when Peter unmasks. Miles arrives and confirms Peter's story. Talking with Gwen and Miles, Peter confirms that Gwen exists in his world without mentioning that her counterpart is dead. He also mentions his relationship with Mary Jane, and is shocked to hear that his counterpart dated Kitty Pryde, while Miles is left curious whether he has a counterpart in Peter's world. As Fury arrives to pick Peter up, Peter sees Mary Jane watching him, but she runs away before he can talk to her. Returning to the Helicarrier, Peter learns that Stark is having trouble determining how he can identify Peter's world of origin amid the multitude of alternate universes. With Miles' help, the Ultimates determine the location of Mysterio's headquarters based on the energy generated by his equipment, prompting the heroes to suit up and head for the base. At his headquarters, Mysterio is preparing to cement his victory by destroying the portal and trapping Spider-Man in the Ultimate universe. Unable to resist the temptation to see how his enemy is faring, he keeps the portal open long enough for Peter and the Ultimates to capture him. Despite his best efforts, Mysterio is quickly defeated, and Fury decides to keep him prisoner on their side of the rift due to his knowledge of Peter's secret identity. With the portal closing, Peter departs for his world after giving Miles his blessing as the new Spider-Man of this world. Back in his world, Peter runs a search for Miles' counterpart in his world and is shocked at the result. Publication history Initially, the Ultimate Marvel imprint had no crossovers with the mainstream Marvel comics. At the 2005 San Diego Comic-Con, Joe Quesada said that if the mainstream and Ultimate Marvel universes ever crossed over, it would signify that Marvel \\"had officially run out of ideas.\\" Brian Michael Bendis and Axel Alonso made the first crossover in 2012, after 13 years of the Ultimate Marvel imprint, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Spider-Man. Alonso described the story with: The first issue was released on June 13, 2012. Reception The series received generally positive reviews. The individual issues hold an average rating of 8.1 out of 10 on the review aggregator website Comic Book Roundup, based on 85 total reviews of all five issues, which range in rating from 7.3 (issue 1) and 8.5 (issue 4).\\"Spider-Men Reviews\\". Comic Book Roundup. Retrieved October 21, 2014. Joey Esposito of IGN, who gave the first issue an 8.5 out of 10, praised the creative team, singling out the strong thematic elements set up by Bendis, and the graceful line work, cityscapes, action and comedic timing of Pichelli's art. Esposito also complimented Cory Petit's lettering, comparing his use of different fonts when Spider-Man arrives in the Ultimate Universe to the use of color that characterizes Dorothy's arrival in Oz in the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. James Hunt of Comic Book Resources, who gave the issue four and a half out of five stars, called it \\"one of the most momentous Spider-Man stories to be published in years\\", praising the issue's pace and tone, and Pichelli's art. Sequel There was a second miniseries, Spider-Men II, released in 2017. It was a new team-up of Peter and Miles, now both living in the mainstream Marvel universe. It also features the native Miles Morales of the mainstream universe, an adult and close friend of the Kingpin. At the end of the story, the adult Morales moves into the Ultimate Marvel universe, which had been destroyed in the 2015 Secret Wars crossover. This remade the Ultimate universe, Peter Parker is now Spider-Man again, and has joined the Ultimates. In other media * Elements of this story are incorporated into the plot of Spider-Man: Into the Spider- Verse. Like in the original story, Peter Parker is brought into Miles' dimension, not long after the death of his counterpart there, as the result of a villain's schemes involving multiversal travel (though in this case, it's the Kingpin from Miles' universe).

Many of the attacks were caught on video, and received worldwide attention. The New York City Police Department was greatly criticized for its handling of the attacks. Eventually, over fifty women reported being harassed or assaulted. Background The Puerto Rican Day Parade, an annual event held on the second Sunday in June, marches down Fifth Avenue from 44th Street to 79th Street, passing by Central Park along the way. The temperature on June 11 was over . Parade observers noted the smell of marijuana in the air, and some reported that paraders were smoking in full presence of officers. The police disputed this claim. Other witnesses reported seeing attendants openly drinking alcohol. One witness later recalled seeing \\"alcohol all over the street, bottles of liquor, people offering shots.\\" Before noon, a group of three women were harassed and fondled near the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Hours later, witnesses began noticing groups of men using water guns and other vessels to splash attendants indiscriminately as well as men shouting lewd insults at passing women. While there were nearly a thousand police officers assigned to Central Park during the parade, none were present along a stretch of Center Drive, where many of the more violent attacks would take place. Attacks At 6:14 p.m. EDT, the first of the violent attacks began. At Simon Bolivar Plaza, near Sixth Avenue and Central Park South, a group of 15 to 20 men descended upon two teenagers, sprayed them with water, and proceeded to grope them. One victim was pushed to the ground and an assailant stole a pocketbook from them before moving on. A few minutes later, the attackers surrounded a French honeymooning couple on Center Drive near Wollman Rink. The group doused the woman with water, with some men reportedly chanting, \\"Soak her! Soak her!\\" The group then tore off her clothes and undergarments, fondled her, and yanked her jewelry from her neck. Her husband attempted to save her, forcing his way through the crowd, and taking her out of the park to a policeman. The couple was ushered into a police scooter, but the crowd surrounded the scooter and attempted to continue the attack. Soon after, another victim, skating down Central Park South was assaulted by a group of men. She was pulled to the ground and the assailants attempted to remove her shorts. The men eventually gave up after stealing her cell phone. The victim then attempted to report the attack to a policeman who ignored her. Dozens of women were subsequently mobbed and assaulted. One of the last attacks was on a trio of British tourists at around 6:48 p.m. The three teenagers were sitting on a fence in the park when a group of men began groping them. One of the teenagers was forcibly separated from her group, stripped, sexually assaulted and sexually abused. After a brief respite, a second group of men came upon her and assaulted and robbed her. Aftermath The New York City Police Department was widely criticized for its failures to stop or prevent the attacks. Mayor Rudy Giuliani initially defended the NYPD, remarking, \\"We have 41,000 police officers, and they can't be everywhere, at every point...\\" Police Commissioner Howard Safir told reporters, \\"If I put 10,000 cops in Central Park, we couldn't cover every single area.\\" Giuliani later said that officers who had not helped victims \\"should be severely disciplined.\\" Over 50 women came forward to report having been attacked. In 2006, a civil suit against the city for failing to provide police protection was finally settled. =Charges= Manuel Vargas, a Dominican American from Washington Heights and a suspected ringleader, was quoted by the press as saying he \\"was just having fun\\".Suspect Just \\"Having Fun\\" from the New York Daily News dated June 17, 2000 Eventually, 30 people were charged in the assaults, 18 pleaded guilty or were convicted, one was acquitted, and 11 had their charges dismissed. The longest sentence handed down was five years for Abel Ortiz. Eleven police officers and three 9-1-1 operators were disciplined, and the city paid over $500,000 in lawsuit settlements to victims. Mayor Giuliani banned alcohol at the parade the following year. In media The 2000 Puerto Rican Day Parade attacks formed the basis of episode 11-11 of the NBC police procedural Law & Order episode \\"Sunday in the Park with Jorge\\", in which many women were accosted and one was found murdered in Central Park.

Retrieved June 4, 2016.), was a pole sitter who achieved fame in the 1920s and 1930s, sitting for days at a time on elevated perches throughout the United States.  Early life  Kelly was born in Manhattan's Hell's Kitchen neighborhood. His mother died during childbirth and his father died before he was born. He ran away and went to sea at the age of 13, and changed his name to Alvin. In his early years he worked as a steelworker, steeplejack, high diver, boxer and movie double. He was also a licensed pilot who performed aerial stunts. He served as an ensign in the U.S. Naval Auxiliary Reserve during World War I, serving from May 1918 to September 1921. During the war he served on the USS Edgar F. Luckenbach.  Career  According to one account, Kelly climbed his first pole at the age of seven, and at nine he performed a \\"human fly\\" trick, climbing up the side of a building. He is credited with popularizing the pole-sitting fad after sitting atop a flagpole in 1924, either in response to a dare from a friend Long, Mark A., and Jim Fee. Bad Fads.

Web. 22 December 2011. In January of that year he sat on a pole for 13 hours and 13 minutes to publicize a movie. In 1926, Kelly set a record by sitting atop a flagpole in St. Louis, Missouri for seven days and one hour; in June 1927, he planned to beat that record by sitting for eight days in Newark, New Jersey.\\"Flagpole Rooster\\".

In 1930 he set a world record by sitting on a flagpole on top of the Steel Pier in Atlantic City, high, for 49 days and one hour. At the height of his fame as a latter- day stylite, he toured 28 cities, charging admission to people who wanted to stand on roofs to see his performance stunts. He also earned an income from endorsements, personal appearances and books about his life. He called himself \\"the luckiest fool in the world.\\" He once calculated that over two decades he spent 20,613 hours sitting on flagpoles, of which 210 were in sub-freezing weather and 1400 hours in the rain. In one 1927 stunt, he climbed on a pole on a speeding biplane, sitting on a iron crossbar as the plane flew high. The New York Times reported that \\"he didn't get around to hanging by one hand, as he promised he would.\\" While pole sitting, Kelly was said to have subsisted mainly on coffee and cigarettes. He learned how to nap while sitting upright, and never was secured by more than a simple leg strap. He once claimed that he doesn't \\"take as many chances as a window cleaner.\\" Journalist Jay Maeder wrote that \\"The newspapers were regularly full of pictures of Shipwreck Kelly, matter-of-factly brushing his teeth and shaving his face, hundreds of feet in the air.\\" He said that he was able to sleep while pole sitting by putting his thumbs in holes in the pole shafts. If he swayed, the pain in his thumbs would force him to right himself without waking him up. His career began to decline after the Wall Street Crash of 1929, and in 1934 he was working as a gigolo at a Broadway dance hall, Roseland, then a \\"dime a dance\\" hall. Journalist H. Allen Smith found him \\"wearing a tail coat and silk hat, sitting on a plush divan.\\" By then, Kelly said, 17 people were claiming to be him, because few people knew what he looked like. In the 1930s there was less tolerance for such stunts, and police took a dim view of the disruption it caused. In 1935 he attempted to break his Atlantic City record by sitting on a pole in the Bronx, but was aloft for less than a day before he was arrested as a public nuisance. He only climbed down from the pole after police threatened to cut it down. One of his last major public appearances was on October 13, 1939: Kelly celebrated National Donut Dunking Week by sitting on a pole atop the Chanin Building on East 42nd Street in Manhattan and eating 13 donuts dunked into a coffee cup and fed to him while he stood on his head.Romero, Librado. \\"Timeless\\". New York Times 29 September 2010: 24. Newspaper Source Plus. Web. 22 December 2011. But by then that kind of work had pretty much dried up, He served in the United States Merchant Marine during World War II. Accounts vary as to how Kelly acquired his nickname. He claimed to have survived during his lifetime five shipwrecks, two airplane and three automobile accidents, and one train wreck, all without injury. His wife told reporters that he was a survivor of the sinking of the RMS Titanic. However, there were only three Titanic survivors named Kelly and all were women, and \\"there is no reason to believe that he ever came near the Titanic.\\" He is also said to have gained the nickname as a boxer, because \\"he was so often adrift in the ring that the handle became inevitable.\\" He was described in a 1939 article as a \\"stocky, blue-eyed, battered little Irishman\\" with \\"sparse red hair.\\" Kelly's last flagpole-sitting appearance was at an Orange, Texas event sponsored by the Lion's Club on October 4, 1952, one week before his death. Two heart attacks forced him to come down from the 65-foot pole, and the club refused to let him go back up. He retired as a result of the heart attacks, saying \\"This is it. I'm through.\\" Personal life Kelly married an elevator operator, Frances Vivian Steele of Dallas, Texas, whom he met while pole sitting. They had a son, Alvin Kieran Kelly, who became a laborer for the Clyde Beatty Circus. In June 1973, the son was killed at the age of 45 by an elephant during a performance in Tenafly, New Jersey. A female Asiatic elephant lifted him in the air and then put him down and stepped on his chest, crushing him to death before a horrified crowd. Death At the time of his death in October 1952, Kelly had become a \\"grizzled old man\\" ‚Äì penniless and all but forgotten. He was by then a widower who had been on home relief for six months, and his son was in the U.S. Army overseas. He had been suffering from an asthmatic heart and hardening of the arteries. Kelly died on October 11, 1952 when he was struck by a car while walking on Manhattan's West 51st Street, near the rooming house where he lived and not far from his birthplace.Rasmussen, Frederick M. \\"The original flagpole sitter.\\" The Baltimore Sun, November 20, 1999. www.articles.baltimoresun.com.

He is one of the few pulp authors to go on to enjoy success as both an author in \\"slick\\" magazines, such as the Saturday Evening Post, and as an in-demand writer in Hollywood. Early life Steve Fisher was born 29 August 1912, in Marine City, Michigan. He was raised in Los Angeles, California, where he attended Oneonta Military Academy until running away to join the Navy at the age of sixteen.Restaino 143 Fisher spent four years in the Navy submarine service, during which time he wrote prolifically, selling stories to U.S. Navy and Our Navy.Gruber 56 After Fisher's discharge from the Navy, he settled in Greenwich Village, New York, where he decided to pursue writing as a career. The first few months proved difficult. Fisher could not sell a story and suffered eviction from two apartments, and once had his electricity shut off.Gruber 57-8 In March 1934, however, he would publish his first story, \\"Hell‚Äôs Scoop,\\" in Sure-Fire Detective Magazine, beginning a career of considerable literary success. Pulp years Fisher's \\"Mistress Death\\" was the cover story on the May‚ÄìJune 1936 issue of New Mystery Adventures Fisher published extensively in pulps throughout the 1930s, ‚Äò40s and into the ‚Äò50s.

Some of Fisher‚Äôs most significant stories, however, would be published in Black Mask, the seminal detective magazine. Famous Mask editor Joe Shaw rejected early submissions by Fisher, but under the editorship of Fanny Ellsworth, Fisher would help create a more emotional, psychological crime story, different from his hard-boiled Mask predecessors. Fisher stated, \\"[My] subjective style, mood and approach to a story was the antithesis of [a] Roger Torrey who, like Hammett, wrote objectively, with crisp, cold precision\\".Nolan 31 \\"The more emotionally charged style caught on and was featured in a number of detective pulps,\\" helping to establish a place for similar authors, such as Fisher's friend Cornell Woolrich.Server 76 In total Fisher would publish nine stories in Black Mask: \\"Death of a Dummy,\\" \\"Flight to Paris,\\" \\"Hollywood Party,\\" \\"Jake and Jill,\\" \\"Latitude Unknown,\\" \\"Murder at Eight,\\" \\"No Gentleman Strangles His Wife,\\" \\"Wait for Me,\\" \\"You‚Äôll Always Remember Me,\\".Hagemann 98-9 Fisher would also break into slick magazines during this period, a rare feat for a pulp writer. His stories saw simultaneous publication in pulps and in slicks such as Liberty, Collier's, The Saturday Evening Post, Cosmopolitan and American Magazine to name a few.Restaino 144 He would also publish under the pennames Stephen Gould and Grant Lane, and would go on to publish hundreds of stories in pulp and slick magazinesPenzler, Black Mask 914 including Lt.

Fisher wrote the screenplays for such notable films noir as Dead Reckoning and Lady in the Lake. He would also spend time writing novels, most notably I Wake Up Screaming, which was made into a film by the same name starring Victor Mature.

After being captured by British Forces in April 1945, it was designed as Advanced Landing Ground B-172 Husum. The British Air Force of Occupation later converted it into a real airfield in 1946/1947 but no permanent RAF units were assigned to it. The airfield remained in a care and maintenance status until 1959 when it was transferred to the new West German Air Force on 1 October 1959. It became home to JaBoG 35 (Jagdbombergeschwader35 of 35 Fighter-Bomber Wing) flying F-84 Thunderstreaks and 4 T-33 trainers. The Wing transferred to the new FIAT G-91 fighter bomber in 1966, signalling a new name for the unit. It was now known as Leichtes Kampfgeschwader 41 (LKG41 or 41 Light Attack Wing). With the transition to the Alpha Jet in 1980 the Wing was renamed again, this time becoming JaBoG 41. When JaBoG41 disbanded after the end of the Cold War the southwest part of the airfield became a civilian airfield. The Northeast side remained part of the German Air Force, and became home to Flugabwehrrakettengeschwader (FlaRakG) 1 \\"Schleswig-Holstein\\" in 2001. FlaRakG 1 (English: Air Defense Missile Wing 1) was equipped with the MIM-104 Patriot Surface to Air Missile (SAM) and HAWK missile systems. The HAWKs were withdrawn in 2001. The group took control of the army's Mantis SHORAD (Short Range Air Defense) systems in 2011. The military part is closed off from the civilian airport by a fence, which encompasses the former air base minus the civilian airfield and also crosses the runway. The civilian part of the airfield is in charge of the control tower, some hangars, a parking and 1450m of the runway (the southern half). It is run by the Flughafen Husum GmbH & Co. KG.

Life  Georgy Voznesensky was born on March 22, 1903 in Kursk, Russia into a family of a priest, Father Nicholas Voznesensky and his wife Lydia. In 1909, his family moved to Blagoveschensk on the Amur River in Siberia. In 1920, Georgy graduated from the local gymnasium. Later in 1920 in the midst of the Russian Civil War, his family moved to Harbin, Manchuria. In 1921, his mother died, and his father accepted tonsure as a monk with the name Dimitry. Dimitri later became Archbishop of Hailar. He died in 1947 shortly after he repatriated to the Soviet Union. Living in Harbin, Georgy entered the Russo-Chinese Polytechnic Institute from which he graduated in 1927 as an electromechanical engineer. He then began studies in pastoral theology in what became the Theology Department of the University of St. Vladimir. In 1930, Georgy was ordained a deacon. In 1931, Georgy graduated from St. Vladimir University. Also in 1931, he was tonsured a monk with the name Philaret. In 1932, he was ordained a Hieromonk. In 1937, he was elevated to Igumen and to the rank of archimandrite. During this period he was also a professor of New Testament, Pastoral Theology, and Homiletics at St. Vladimir University. In mid 1945, after the Communist Chinese and Soviet forces took over Manchuria at the end of World War II, archimandrite Philaret remained with the Orthodox believers in Manchuria, but he firmly rejected all attempts to get him to accept a Soviet passport. Further, he fearlessly denounced the atheistic communists. His overt position against the Soviets placed him in great personal danger. Their hatred of him resulted in an attempt to burn him alive in his monastic cell. He escaped, but suffered severe burns. In 1962, the Synod of Bishops of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia was able to acquire an exit visa for archimandrite Philaret that allowed him to reach Hong Kong. From there archimandrite Philaret quickly traveled to Brisbane, Australia where many of his former flock in Manchuria had settled. After his arrival in Brisbane, his followers petition the Synod of ROCOR to appoint him their bishop. On 17 October 1962 The General Council was committed to electing Archimandrite Philaret Vosnesensky to the See of Brazil. Archbishop Sava made a powerful presentation to the assembled bishops, asserting that Philaret should be left in Australia and appointed second suffragan bishop for the diocese as Bishop of Brisbane. Sava reminded the bishops of his failing health and considered Philaret to be a possible successor to himself, especially as so many parishioners in Australia knew and respected Philaret in Harbin. The General Council acquiesced to Sava's plea and it was decided to elevate Archimandrite Philaret to the episcopal dignity.Protopopov M. A.

Archimandrite Philaret was consecrated asBishop of Brisbane, vicar of the Australian diocese by archbishop Sava and bishop Anthony of Melbourne on May 26, 1963. In 1964, bishop Philaret represented archbishop Sava at a meeting of the Council of Bishops of ROCOR in which the first hierarch metropolitan Anastassy announced his resignation. As the youngest bishop among those at the council, the Council elected Bp. Philaret the successor to Metr. Anastassy. Metr. Philaret was enthroned first hierarch of ROCOR on May 14, 1964. Metropolitan Philaret served as the first hierarch of ROCOR for twenty one years. He reposed on November 21, 1985 and was buried in the cemetery of the Church of Dormition. In November 1998, the Synod decided to transfer Metropolitan Philaret's relics to a new vault under the altar of Holy Trinity Cathedral at Jordanville, New York. When his tomb was opened, his relics were found to be incorrupt.  Canonizations  Metropolitan Philaret was canonized by the number of church groups which derive their succession from the ROCOR but none of whom are in communion with the mainstream Orthodox Church. On May 19 ‚Äì 20, 2001 Metropolitan Philaret was glorified by the Holy Orthodox Church in North America (\\"Boston Synod\\"). On April 30, 2003 Metropolitan Philaret was glorified by the Russian Orthodox Autonomous Church. On November 20, 2008 Metropolitan Philaret was glorified by the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad headed by metropolitan Agathangel (Pashkovsky). On October 23, 2009 Metropolitan Philaret was glorified at Holy Transfiguration Skete by the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad headed by archbishop Vladimir (Tselischev).

The operation was a prelude to the long-planned Siege of Stralsund that followed shortly thereafter.  Background  The first invasion of R√ºgen in this war took place on 17 September 1677, when the Danes landed and succeeded, after the Battle of Bergen, in expelling the Swedes from the entire island. Soon after, the Swedes under the command of Field Marshal Otto Wilhelm von Konigsmark began moves to recapture the island, which proved successful when they won the Battle of Warksow on 18 January 1678. The island was not safe for long in spite of this Swedish victory, mainly because the Danes made several raids on R√ºgen over the summer. The possession of the island of R√ºgen was strategically important for both warring parties, as the side that controlled the island could also guarantee the supply of the most important fortress in Swedish Pomerania, namely the town of Stralsund located on the mainland coast. The possession of the island was thus a prerequisite for a successful conquest of the fortress of Stralsund, which was in Swedish hands, by the Allies of Brandenburg and Denmark.  Invasion of R√ºgen  Swedish field marshal, K√∂nigsmarck Denmark made a total of 27 warships available for the invasion, whose task was to protect the landing. In addition, Brandenburg had 10 warships at their disposal, seven of which were ships hired from Benjamin Raule (each with 107 cannon and 435-man crews) and three provided by the prince-elector himself. A Brandenburg army had been standing by in Pomerania since mid-July 1678. The start of the operation was delayed by the late arrival, in August, of the Brandenburg squadron of warships under Benjamin Raule. In addition, Brandenburg required a lot of time to put together the required transport vessels. The transport fleet consisted of 210 large and 140 smaller ships. Command of the navy was assumed by the Danish lieutenant admiral general, Nils Juel. The transport fleet was commanded by Admiral Cornelis Tromp. The command of the invasion force, the Brandenburg Corps, was held by General Field Marshal Derfflinger. The Brandenburg landing force had a strength of 1,440 cuirassiers, 300 dragoons and 5,500 infantry, a total of 7,240 men altogether. The Corps also had some field artillery: four 6-pounders and fourteen 3-pounders served by 76 men. The strength of the Danish landing force was 1,800 men. The fleet assembled on the Stubber Bank in the Bay of Greifswald. The operational plan envisaged for a landing of the Danes in the north of the island and the Brandenburg troops to the south, so as to fragment the limited number of Swedish forces. The Brandenburg Navy under the command of the Elector Frederick William weighed anchor on 22 September. In order to leave the Swedes as long as possible in the dark as to the landing site, the plan was to allow the fleet to turn around at Palmer Ort and, from there, to change course to a northeasterly direction toward Putbus, where the troops would go ashore. When the fleet arrived, however, at Palmer Ort, the wind shifted to the northeast. The planned manoeuvre was no longer feasible. Added to this was the fact that the Swedes had cannon posted on Zudar (the southernmost peninsula of R√ºgen) that now opened fire on the invasion fleet. In this critical situation, a cannonball struck close beside the Elector. Otherwise the damage was minimal. As the wind direction remained steady, the fleet had great difficulty sailing out of firing range of the Swedish artillery and dropped anchor to wait for more favourable winds. That same day, the Danes under the command of Admiral Nils Juel, however, did succeed on 22 September in landing at Cape Arkona, at the fishing village of Vittorio. A small Swedish body of troops in front of the town tried to oppose the landing, but was pushed back to the Schaabe spit. In this small battle, the Danes lost 57 dead and 52 wounded. Swedish losses were higher. The Danes then barricaded themselves at the entrance of the narrow spit of Schaab. When the Swedish field marshal, K√∂nigsmarck, learned of the Danish landing, he ordered the immediate withdrawal of his troops, who were now in a hopeless situation, to Altef√§hr. Contemporary painting of the Elector's arrival on R√ºgen The bombardment by Swedish artillery of Brandenburg troops as they land on 23 September 1678 near Neukamp (by Jan Luiken) The Elector, becoming impatient because of the Danish landing, ordered his troops to land at the nearest point, since based on his understanding (he knew nothing of the Swedish retreat), he feared that Sweden would concentrate their attack on the Danes. Thus, the Brandenburg force advanced overland to a point near Neukamp on 23 September 1678. Here there was a Swedish redoubt with eight guns and cavalry, which the invading troops engaged without success. When the growing number of Brandenburg troops brought their own cannon up and fired on the redoubt, the Swedes withdrew. The landing force was completely ashore within two hours. In addition to the Elector, the Brandenburg field marshal, Derfflinger, was also on the spot. The infantry that had landed earlier began at once, as previously practised, to construct chevaux de frise to protect themselves against an expected attack. The Swede K√∂nigsmarck, who had rushed over from the Zudar peninsula, retreated when he saw the Brandenburg army drawn up in full order of battle. In the subsequent pursuit of the Swedes by the Brandenburg cavalry, 200 Swedes were taken prisoner. Derfflinger and his cavalry took off in pursuit of the Swedes on the morning of 24 September. The latter had now reached Altef√§hr, where utter confusion broke out, as they all wanted to get to Stralsund. The Brandenburg cavalry took advantage of this opportunity and stormed the ramparts. In doing so, they managed to take over 700 prisoners and 250 warhorses, as well as all the cannon the Swedes possessed. K√∂nigsmarck succeeded with great difficulty in escaping, but many overcrowded boats sank during the crossing. Likewise, Brandenburg easily captured the important Neuf√§hr Redoubht. The personnel manning this redoubt consisted mainly of Danish and Brandenburg prisoners of war taken in January as a result of their defeat in the Battle of Warksow. These prisoners revolted against their Swedish officers and handed over the redoubt without a fight to the Brandenburg troops. The island was now once again in the possession of the Allies.  Consequences of the invasion  With the conquest of the island, the military fate of the Swedish fortress of Stralsund, now besieged by Brandenburg troops, was sealed. While Danish troops remained on the island, Brandenburg forces returned to the mainland to take part in the siege of Stralsund. The Allies captured the fort after a heavy bombardment. As a result, half the town went up in flames and burned until 22 October 1678. The island was given as promised to the Danes, who occupied it until the conclusion of the treaty. After the Treaty of Saint-Germain on 29 June 1679, the island was again held by Swedes. The island itself was economically ruined thanks to the many battles and the large number of foreign troops, so that the Danish occupation troops had to be supplied from the Danish mainland until the end of the war.  Commemoration  Prussian columns at Neukamp at the site of the landing place, built in 1854 To commemorate the various landings on R√ºgen, the Prussian king Frederick William IV ordered the construction of two 15-metre-high Prussia Columns at the respective landing sites in 1854 and 1855. The monument at Neukamp, which portrays the Great Elector Frederick William, was inaugurated on 15 October 1854. These columns were also intended to demonstrate the power of Prussia's claim over the southern Baltic.  References   Literature  * Maren Lorenz: Das Rad der Gewalt.

The common denominator for all such programs is some form of government action aimed at extending access to health care as widely as possible and setting minimum standards. Most implement universal health care through legislation, regulation and taxation. Legislation and regulation direct what care must be provided, to whom, and on what basis. The logistics of universal healthcare vary by country. Some programs are paid for entirely out of tax revenues. In others tax revenues are used either to fund insurance for the very poor or for those needing long term chronic care. In some cases such as the UK, government involvement also includes directly managing the health care system, but many countries use mixed public-private systems to deliver universal health care. In twenty five European countries, universal healthcare entails a government-regulated network of private insurance companies. Africa =Algeria= Algeria operates a public healthcare system. It is a universal healthcare system as well. A network of hospitals, clinics, and dispensaries provide treatment to the population, with the Social Security system funding health services, although many people must still cover part of their costs due to the rates paid by the Social Security system unchanged since 1987. The poor are generally entitled to taxpayer funded health services, while the wealthy pay for treatment according to a sliding scale. =Botswana= Botswana operates a system of public medical centers, with 98% of health facilities in the country run by the government. All citizens are entitled to be treated in taxpayer funded facilities, though a nominal fee of ~70 BWP (~US$6.60) is typically charged for public health services except for sexual reproductive health services and antiretroviral therapy services, which are free. =Burkina Faso= Burkina Faso provides universal healthcare to citizens through a system called Universal Health Insurance (AMU)‚Äîadministered by two bodies, one for civilians and the other for the armed forces. =Egypt= Egypt operates a system of public hospitals and clinics through the Ministry of Health. Egyptian citizens can receive treatment at these facilities free of charge. However, those Egyptians who can afford it prefer to pay out of pocket for private healthcare. =Ghana= Ghana operates the National Health Insurance Scheme to provide citizens with health insurance. The level of premiums citizens must pay varies according to their level of income. Most medical facilities are run directly by the Ministry of Health or Ghana Health Service. =Mauritius= The Government of Mauritius operates a system of medical facilities that provide treatment to citizens free of charge. =Morocco= Morocco operates a public health sector run by the government that operates 85% of the country's hospital beds. It deals mainly with the poor and rural populations, who cannot afford private healthcare. In addition, a non-profit health sector operated by the National Social Security Fund covers 16% of the population. Private medical care is available for those who can afford it. =Rwanda= Rwanda operates a system of universal health insurance through the Ministry of Health called Mutuelle de Sant√© (Mutual Health), a system of community-based insurance where people pay premiums based on their income level into local health insurance funds, with the wealthiest paying the highest premiums and required to cover a small percentage of their medical expenses, while those at the lowest income levels are exempt from paying premiums and can still utilize the services of their local health fund. In 2012, this system insured all but 4% of the population. = Seychelles = The Government of Seychelles operates a system of medical facilities that provide treatment to citizens free of charge. =South Africa= South Africa has a public healthcare system that provides services to the vast majority of the population, though it is chronically underfunded and understaffed, and there is a private system that is far better equipped, which covers the wealthier sectors of society. However, customer satisfaction among users of private health insurance was at 74.2 in 2017 (dropping to 72.7% in 2018) while the public option was rated at 81%. =Tunisia= Tunisia operates a public healthcare system under the National Health Insurance Fund (Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Maladie). All Tunisian citizens and residents can receive treatment in state-run hospitals and clinics for a very low co- pay, while people with the lowest income are able to apply for an exemption from co-pays. Americas Argentina, The Bahamas, Brazil, Barbados, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay, and Venezuela all provide some level of universal health coverage. =Argentina= Health care is provided through a combination of employer and labor union-sponsored plans (Obras Sociales), government insurance plans, public hospitals and clinics and through private health insurance plans. It costs almost 10% of GDP and is available to anyone regardless of ideology, beliefs, race or nationality. =The Bahamas= The Bahamas approved the National Health Insurance Act in August 2016. The legislation establishes a universal health coverage system that begins with universal coverage of primary health care services, and later expands to include a wide set of benefits that includes all specialized care. The system allows for universal coverage of a basic benefit package and for voluntary insurance to be purchased as a top-up policy to cover services or amenities that are not included in the government plan. =Brazil= The universal health care system was adopted in Brazil in 1988 after the end of the military regime's rule. However, universal health care was available many years before, in some cities, once the 27th amendment to the 1969 Constitution imposed the duty of applying 6% of their income in healthcare on the municipalities. =Canada= In 1984, the Canada Health Act was passed, which prohibited extra billing by doctors on patients while at the same time billing the public insurance system. In 1999, the prime minister and most premiers reaffirmed in the Social Union Framework Agreement that they are committed to health care that has \\"comprehensiveness, universality, portability, public administration and accessibility.\\"Government of Canada, Social Union, News Release, \\"A Framework to Improve the Social Union for Canadians: An Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Governments of the Provinces and Territories, February 4, 1999.\\" Retrieved December 20, 2006. The system is for the most part publicly funded, yet most of the services are provided by private enterprises or private corporations, although most hospitals are public. Most doctors do not receive an annual salary, but receive a fee per visit or service.Public vs. private health care. CBC, December 1, 2006. About 29% of Canadians' health care is paid for by the private sector or individuals.Press release, \\"Health care spending to reach $160 billion this year\\" , Canadian Institute for Health Information, November 13, 2007. Retrieved November 19, 2007. This mostly goes towards services not covered or only partially covered by Medicare such as prescription drugs, dentistry, physiotherapy and vision care.National Health Expenditure Trends, 1975‚Äì2007 , Canadian Institute for Health Information, November 13, 2007. Retrieved November 19, 2007. Many Canadians have private health insurance, often through their employers, that cover these expenses. The Canada Health Act of 1984 \\"does not directly bar private delivery or private insurance for publicly insured services,\\" but provides financial disincentives for doing so. \\"Although there are laws prohibiting or curtailing private health care in some provinces, they can be changed,\\" according to a report in the New England Journal of Medicine. The legality of the ban was considered in a decision of the Supreme Court of Canada, which ruled in Chaoulli v. Quebec that \\"the prohibition on obtaining private health insurance, while it might be constitutional in circumstances where health care services are reasonable as to both quality and timeliness, is not constitutional where the public system fails to deliver reasonable services.\\" The appellant contended that waiting times in Quebec violated a right to life and security in the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms. The Court agreed, but acknowledged the importance and validity of the Canada Health Act, and at least four of the seven judges explicitly recognized the right of governments to enact laws and policies that favour the public over the private system and preserve the integrity of the public system. =Chile= Health care in Chile is provided by the government (via public corporation FONASA, National Healthcare Fund) and by private insurers (via ISAPRE, Previsional Healthcare Institutions). All workers and pensioners are mandated to pay 7% of their income for health care insurance (the poorest pensioners are exempt from this payment but medications are expensive and pensioners have to pay). Workers who choose not to join an Isapre, are automatically covered by Fonasa. Fonasa also covers unemployed people receiving unemployment benefits, uninsured pregnant women, insured worker's dependant family, people with mental or physical disabilities and people who are considered poor or indigent. Fonasa costs vary depending on income, disability or age. Attention at public health facilities via Fonasa is free for low-income earners, people with mental or physical disabilities and people over the age of 60. Others pay 10% or 20% of the costs, depending on income and number of dependants. Fonasa beneficiaries may also seek attention in the private sector, for a designated fee. Additionally, exist the GES Plan (Explicit Guarantees in Healthcare Plan), that consist of a defined number of high-morbility and mortality diseases (currently 85) that have special mandatory attention guarantees for all people, both Isapre and Fonasa affiliates, in relation to: * Access: Universal access to treatment if required. Individuals will be able to get attention from a provider near their place of residence. * Opportunity: Opportune waiting times, there is a maximum pre-established time limit to get initial and post-diagnosis attention. * Financial protection: Law-fixed maximum price with low copayments to providers (maximum copayment of 20% of the cost), the payment cannot be an obstacle to attention. The total cost must not exceed one monthly income for the family in a year. * Best possible quality of service: Attention only in accredited public or private Health centers, that follow technical requirement standards that will be established based on medical evidence. The treatment protocols and number of diseases included are evaluated every 3 years by the authorities. =Colombia= In 1993 a reform transformed the health care system in Colombia, trying to provide a better, sustainable, health care system and to reach every Colombian citizen. =Costa Rica= Universal healthcare and pensions are run by the Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social (CCSS). In 1941, Costa Rica established Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social (CCSS), a social security insurance system for wage-earning workers. In 1961, coverage was expanded to include workers‚Äô dependents and from 1961 to 1975, a series of expansions extended coverage for primary care and outpatient and inpatient specialized services to people in rural areas, the low-income population, and certain vulnerable populations. Further expansions during the late 1970s extended insurance coverage to farmers, peasants, and independent contract workers. Additionally, CCSS mandates free health service provision to mothers, children, indigenous people, the elderly, and people living with disabilities, regardless of insurance coverage. By 2000, 82 percent of the population was eligible for CCSS, which has continued to expand in the ensuing period. By covering all population groups through the same system, Costa Rica has avoided social insurance stratification and inequity common in many other countries in the region. CCSS is funded by a 15 percent payroll tax, as well as payments from retiree pensions [6]. Taxes on luxury goods, alcohol, soda, and imported products also help to cover poor households who do otherwise pay into the system. All CCSS funds are merged into a single pool, which is managed by the central financial administration of CCSS. In 1973, the Ministry of Health decided to move away from direct service provision and adopt a steering role. Responsibility for the provision of most care was transferred to the CCSS, although the Ministry retained responsibility for disease control, food and drug regulation, environmental sanitation, child nutrition, and primary care for the poor. Through the CCSS, health care is now essentially free to nearly all Costa Ricans. Private health care is also widely available and INS offers private health insurance plans to supplement CCSS insurance.Toward Universal Health Coverage and Equity in Latin America and the Caribbean https://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0454-0 =Cuba= The Cuban government operates a national health system and assumes fiscal and administrative responsibility for the health care of all its citizens. There are no private hospitals or clinics as all health services are government-run. The present Minister for Public Health is Roberto Morales Ojeda. However, although the coverage is wide, the system is underfunded and recently also understaffed. The government organized medical missions in other countries have taken a significant number of doctors and other personnel. In 2005 there were 25,000 Cuban doctors in Venezuela. =Mexico= Public health care became universal healthcare on January 1, 2020 mandated by the new President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and approved by Congress. It is completely free for Mexican citizens who do not have health insurance. Mexico's new universal healthcare, administered by the Instituto de Salud para el Bienestar (Institute of Health for Welfare, INSABI), includes free consultations with family doctors and specialists, free medications, free surgeries, free dental and vision . As of 2020, public health care is provided to all Mexican citizens as guaranteed via Article 4 of the Constitution. Public care is now fully subsidized by the federal government. All Mexican citizens are eligible for subsidized health care regardless of their work status via a system of health care facilities operating under the federal Secretariat of Health (formerly the Secretaria de Salubridad y Asistencia, or SSA) agency. Employed citizens and their dependents, however, are further eligible to use the health care program administered and operated by the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS) (English: Mexican Social Security Institute). The IMSS health care program is a tripartite system funded equally by the employee, its private employer, and the federal government. The IMSS does not provide service to employees of the public sector. Employees in the public sector are serviced by the Instituto de Seguridad y Servicios Sociales de los Trabajadores del Estado (ISSSTE) (English: Institute for Social Security and Services for State Workers), which attends to the health and social care needs of government employees. This includes local, state, and federal government employees. The government of the states in Mexico also provide health services independently of those services provided by the federal government programs. In most states, the state government has established free or subsidized healthcare to all their citizens. Back 2006, the Mexican government created the Health Insurance for a New Generation also known as \\"life insurance for babies\\". On May 28, 2009, Universal Care Coverage for Pregnant Women was introduced. But in 2020, all Mexicans are covered including babies and women. =Peru= On April 10, 2009, the Government of Peru published the Law on Health Insurance to enable all Peruvians to access quality health services, and contribute to regulate the financing and supervision of these services. The law enables all population to access diverse health services to prevent illnesses, and promote and rehabilitate people, under a Health Basic Plan (PEAS). On April 2, 2010, President Alan Garcia Perez on Friday signed a supreme ordinance approving the regulations for the framework law on the Universal Health Insurance, which seeks to provide access to quality health care for all Peruvian citizens. Peru's Universal Health Insurance law aims to increase access to timely and quality health care services, emphasizes maternal and child health promotion, and provides the poor with protection from financial ruin due to illness. The regulation states that membership of the Universal Health Insurance (AUS for its Spanish acronym) is compulsory for the entire population living in the country. To that end, the Ministry of Health will approve, by supreme ordinance, the mechanisms leading to compulsory membership, as well as escalation and implementation. =Trinidad and Tobago= A universal health care system is used in Trinidad and Tobago and is the primary form of health-care available in the country. It is used by the majority of the population seeking medical assistance, as it is free for all citizens.

(see below), Japan, and South Korea. =Bhutan= The Royal Government of Bhutan maintains a policy of free and universal access to primary health care. As hospital facilities in the country are limited, patients with diseases that cannot be treated in Bhutan, such as cancer, are normally referred to hospitals in India for treatment. Such referral treatment is also carried out at the cost of the Royal Government. =China= As of 2017, more than 97% of people in China are covered by one of three categories of public health insurance. From most generous to least generous, they are the: # Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI, ) # Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI, ) # New Cooperative Medical Service (NCMS, ) The UEBMI is funded 6-12% by employers and 2% by employees; the URBMI entirely by local governments, and it covers students, the unemployed, and the retired; and the NCMS by the central government. In 2016, the government announced plans to merge NCMS with URBMI. China also has five private health insurance companies for supplementary care: the three largest are Ping An, PICC, and China Life. For the public plans, the list of covered procedures is limited, and copayment is common. The proportion of out-of-pocket costs depends on profession and location: for example, workers in urban Shanghai might have 85% of their medical costs covered up to $740,000 while workers in rural Guiyang are reimbursed for 65% of their medical costs up to $29,000 annually. Immediately after the Chinese Communist Revolution in 1949, the state both directly operated all hospitals and clinics. The government paid for healthcare services, and life expectancy improved greatly, although the services provided were basic. State-provided health insurance varied by area: the Cooperative Medical System (CMS) covered rural areas, while the Government Insurance Scheme (GIS) and Labor Insurance Scheme (LIS) covered residents of urban areas. After the Chinese economic reform in 1978, the state reduced spending on hospitals and allowed them to charge patients for profit. The state, however, did not stop paying for certain healthcare services like mandatory vaccination. From the high point of privatization of healthcare in the 1990s, China has been reforming with universal health care as a goal in the 21st century, as part of the \\"moderately prosperous society\\" plan. The New Rural Co-operative Medical Care System (NRCMCS) from 2005, aimed at the rural poor, sets the annual cost of medical coverage at 50 yuan (US$7) per person. As of September 2007, around 80% of the whole rural population of China had signed up (about 685 million people). For patients who go to a small hospital or clinic in their local town, the scheme covers from 70 to 80% of their bill; patients at a county provider get 60% if their cost covered; and in a large modern city hospital, the scheme covers about 30% of the bill. At the end of 2008, the government published its reform plan clarifying government's responsibility by saying that it would play a dominant role in providing public health and basic medical service. The plan listed public health, rural areas, city community health services and basic medical insurance as four key areas for government investment. It also promised to tighten government control over medical fees in public hospitals and to set up a \\"basic medicine system\\" to cover drug costs.Staff (October 14, 2008). \\"Medical Reform Draft Open to Public Debate\\".

Healthcare in Georgia is provided by a universal health care system under which the state funds medical treatment in a mainly privatized system of medical facilities. In 2013, the enactment of a universal health care program triggered universal coverage of government-sponsored medical care of the population and improving access to health care services. Responsibility for purchasing publicly financed health services lies with the Social Service Agency (SSA).http://www.euro.who.int/en/countries/georgia/news/news/2015/07/georgias- health-financing-reforms-show-tangible-benefits-for-the-population =Hong Kong= Hong Kong has early health education, professional health services, and well-developed health care and medication system.

The Hospital Authority is a statutory body that operates and manages all public hospitals. Hong Kong has high standards of medical practice. It has contributed to the development of liver transplantation, being the first in the world to carry out an adult to adult live donor liver transplant in 1993. =India= India has a universal healthcare model that is administered at the state level rather than the federal level. Although, in practice, the healthcare system is dominated by the private sector. Currently, the majority of Indian citizens do not have health insurance, and must pay out of pocket for treatment at private hospitals. There are public hospitals and health clinics that are free and funded through taxes.https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/10/role-of- government-in-healthcare-in-india/ Essential drugs are offered free of charge in these hospitals and clinics. An outpatient card at AIIMS costs a one-time fee of 10 rupees (around 20 cents U.S.) and thereafter outpatient medical advice is free. In-hospital treatment costs is extremely minimal and depends on the financial condition of the patient and the facilities utilized, but are usually much less than the private sector. For instance, a patient is waived treatment costs if their income is below the poverty line. However, getting treatment at high quality government hospitals is very tough due to the high number of people needing healthcare and the lack of sufficient facilities. Primary health care is provided by city and district hospitals and rural primary health centres (PHCs). These hospitals provide treatment free of cost. Primary care is focused on immunization, prevention of malnutrition, pregnancy, child birth, postnatal care, and treatment of common illnesses.https://www.who.int/india/health-topics/primary-health-carePatients who receive specialized care or have complicated illnesses are referred to secondary (often located in district and taluk headquarters) and tertiary care hospitals (located in district and state headquarters or those that are teaching hospitals).. In urban cities and towns like Delhi, there are neighbourhood health clinics called Mohalla Clinic which offer completely free treatment, testing and drugs.https://ssir.org/articles/entry/health_care_in_the_mohallas Now organizations like Hindustan Latex Family Planning Promotional Trust and other private organizations have started creating hospitals and clinics in India, which also provide free or subsidized health care and subsidized insurance plans. The government-run healthcare suffers from a lack of hygiene; the rich avoid the government hospitals and go to private hospitals. With the advent of privatized healthcare, this situation has changed. India now has medical tourism for people from other countries while its own poor find high-quality healthcare either inaccessible or unaffordable. The current Indian government has launched Ayushyaman Bharat Yojana(AB-NHPM), which will provide all Indian citizens with insurance coverage for serious illnesses, and free drugs and diagnostic treatments. =Indonesia= Indonesia is currently building a universal healthcare system with its Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional (JKN) scheme, which covers a range of treatments from public providers as well as private providers that opt to participate. The scheme is funded by premiums from the employed. The formally employed pay a premium worth 5% of their salary, with 1% paid by the employee and 4% paid by the employer, while informal workers and the self-employed must pay a fixed monthly premium. As of April 2018, 75% of the population was covered by JKN.https://www.thejakartapost.com/academia/2018/04/06/qa-bpjs-kesehatan- health-for-all-indonesians.html While the country has a number of government- owned hospitals, about 63% are privately owned.https://jakartaglobe.id/business/health-minister-vows-to-fasttrack- private-hospital-permits Indonesia also operates a three-tier community health system. The Indonesian Ministry of Health oversees a network of Puskemas, or community health centers, followed by health sub-centers and village-level integrated posts.http://countrystudies.us/indonesia/57.htm =Israel= Health care in Israel as a percentage of GDP Israel has a system of universal healthcare as set out by the 1995 National Health Insurance Law. The state is responsible for providing health services to all residents of the country, who can register with one of the four national health service funds. To be eligible, a citizen must pay a health insurance tax. Coverage includes medical diagnosis and treatment, preventive medicine, hospitalization (general, maternity, psychiatric and chronic), surgery and transplants, preventive dental care for children, first aid and transportation to a hospital or clinic, medical services at the workplace, treatment for drug abuse and alcoholism, medical equipment and appliances, obstetrics and fertility treatment, medication, treatment of chronic diseases and paramedical services such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy. In Israel, the National Health Insurance Law is the legal framework that enables and facilitates basic, compulsory universal health care. Promoted by health minister Haim Ramon in the early 1990s, the Knesset put the law into effect on January 1, 1995‚Äîbasing it on recommendations from a National Committee of Inquiry headed by Shoshana Netanyahu, which examined restructuring the health care system in Israel in the late 1980s. Prior to the law's passage, over 90% of the population was already covered by voluntarily belonging to one of four nationwide, not-for- profit sickness funds. These operated some of their own medical facilities, funded in part by employers and the government, and in part by the insured via levies that varied according to income. However, there were three problems associated with this arrangement. First, membership in the largest fund, Clalit, required one to belong to the Histadrut labor organization, even if a person did not want to (or could not) have such an affiliation, and other funds restricted entry to new members based on age, pre-existing conditions, or other factors. Second, different funds provided different levels of benefit coverage or services to their members. Lastly, some of the population, albeit a small percentage, had no health insurance. Before the law went into effect, all the funds collected premiums directly from members. However, upon passage of the law, a new progressive national health insurance tax was levied through Bituah Leumi (Israel's social security agency), which then re-distributes the proceeds to the sickness funds based on their membership and its demographic makeup. This ensured that all citizens would now have health coverage. While membership in one of the funds now became compulsory for all, free choice was introduced into movement of members between funds (a change is allowed once every six months), effectively making the various sickness funds compete equally for members among the populace. Annually, a committee appointed by the ministry of health publishes a \\"basket\\" or uniform package of medical services and prescription formulary that all funds must provide as a minimum to all members. Achieving this level of equality guaranteed basic healthcare regardless of fund affiliation, which was one of the principal aims of the law. An appeals process handles rejection of treatments and procedures by the funds and evaluates cases that fall outside the \\"basket\\" of services or prescription formulary. The law is generally considered a success, and Israeli citizens enjoy a high standard of medical care comparatively, with more competition in the country's health care, and with order having brought to what was once a somewhat disorganized system‚Äîthe law nevertheless has its critics. First among the criticisms is that the \\"basket\\" may not provide enough coverage. To partly address this, the health funds began offering \\"supplementary\\" insurance to cover certain additional services not in the basket. However, since this insurance is optional (though rather modestly priced, costing the equivalent of about US$10 to $35 a month depending on age and coverage for an adult in 2019), critics argue that it goes against the spirit of the new law, which stressed equality of healthcare for all citizens. Another criticism is that, to provide universal coverage to all, the tax income base amount (the maximum amount of yearly earnings that are subject to the tax) was set rather high, causing many high-income taxpayers to see the amount they pay for their health premiums (now health tax) skyrocket. Finally, some complain about the constantly rising costs of copayments for certain services. =Japan= All residents of Japan are required by the law to have health insurance coverage. People without insurance from employers can participate in a national health insurance programme, administered by local governments. Patients are free to select physicians or facilities of their choice and cannot be denied coverage. Hospitals, by law, must be run as non- profit and be managed by physicians. =Macau= Macau offers universally accessible single-payer system funded by taxes. Health care is provided by the Bureau for Health. =Maldives= Aasandha is the national healthcare insurance scheme of the Maldives. It provide taxpayer-funded medical assistance to all Maldivian Citizens. National Social Protection Agency Of Maldives was formed under the National Social Health Insurance Act on August 27, 2008 is mandated to administer the National Social Health Insurance Scheme and by an executive order under the same act mandated to conduct social protection programs identified by the government of Maldives. NSPA is also the responsible agency to regulate and conduct Social Protection programs under the Social Protection Act. = The Philippines = Universal Health Care (UHC), also referred to as Kalusugan Pangkalahatan (KP), is the ‚Äúprovision to every Filipino of the highest possible quality of health care that is accessible, efficient, equitably distributed, adequately funded, fairly financed, and appropriately used by an informed and empowered public‚Äù. =Singapore= Singapore has a universal health care system where government ensures affordability, largely through compulsory savings and price controls, while the private sector provides most care. Overall spending on health care amounts to only 3% of annual GDP. Of that, 66% comes from private sources. Singapore currently has the second lowest infant mortality rate in the world and among the highest life expectancies from birth, according to the World Health Organization.World Health Organization, \\"World Health Statistics 2007: Mortality\\", based on 2005 data. Singapore has \\"one of the most successful healthcare systems in the world, in terms of both efficiency in financing and the results achieved in community health outcomes,\\" according to an analysis by global consulting firm Watson Wyatt. Singapore's system uses a combination of compulsory savings from payroll deductions (funded by both employers and workers) a nationalized health insurance plan, and government subsidies, as well as \\"actively regulating the supply and prices of healthcare services in the country\\" to keep costs in check; the specific features have been described as potentially a \\"very difficult system to replicate in many other countries.\\" Many Singaporeans also have supplemental private health insurance (often provided by employers) for services not covered by the government's programs.John Tucci, \\"The Singapore health system ‚Äì achieving positive health outcomes with low expenditure\\", Watson Wyatt Healthcare Market Review, October 2004. =Sri Lanka= Sri Lanka provides free universal healthcare to their citizens. =Taiwan= The current health care system in Taiwan, known as National Health Insurance (NHI), was instituted in 1995. NHI is a single-payer compulsory social insurance plan that centralizes the disbursement of health care dollars. The system promises equal access to health care for all citizens, and the population coverage had reached 99% by the end of 2004.Fanchiang, Cecilia (January 2, 2004). \\"New IC health insurance card expected to offer many benefits\\" . Taiwan Journal. Retrieved March 28, 2008. NHI is mainly financed through premiums based on the payroll tax, and is supplemented with out-of-pocket payments and direct government funding. In the initial stage, fee-for-service predominated for both public and private providers. NHI delivers universal coverage offered by a government-run insurer. The working population pays premiums split with their employers, others pay a flat rate with government help and the poor or veterans are fully subsidized. Under this model, citizens have free range to choose hospitals and physicians without using a gatekeeper and do not have to worry about waiting lists. NHI offers a comprehensive benefit package that covers preventive medical services, prescription drugs, dental services, Chinese medicine, home nurse visits and many more. Since NHI, the previously uninsured have increased their usage of medical services. Most preventive services are free such as annual checkups and maternal and child care. Regular office visits have co- payments as low as US$5 per visit. Co-payments are fixed and unvaried by the person's income. =Thailand= Thailand introduced universal coverage reforms in 2001, becoming one of only a handful of lower-middle income countries to do so at the time. Means-tested health care for low income households was replaced by a new and more comprehensive insurance scheme, originally known as the 30 baht project, in line with the small co-payment charged for treatment. People joining the scheme receive a gold card that they use to access services in their health district, and, if necessary, get referrals for specialist treatment elsewhere. The bulk of finance comes from public revenues, with funding allocated to Contracting Units for Primary Care annually on a population basis. According to the WHO, 65% of Thailand's health care expenditure in 2004 came from the government, 35% was from private sources. Although the reforms have received a good deal of critical comment, they have proved popular with poorer Thais, especially in rural areas, and survived the change of government after the 2006 military coup. The then Public Health Minister, Mongkol Na Songkhla, abolished the 30 baht co-payment and made the UC scheme free. It is not yet clear whether the scheme will be modified further under the coalition government that came to power in January 2008.G20 Health Care: \\"Health Care Systems and Health Market Reform in the G20 Countries.\\" Prepared for the World Economic Forum by Ernst & Young. January 3, 2006. In 2016, Thailand became the first country in Asia to eliminate HIV transmission from mother to child, owing to its robust public healthcare system. Europe Almost all European countries have healthcare available for all citizens. Most European countries have systems of competing private health insurance companies, along with government regulation and subsidies for citizens who cannot afford health insurance premiums. Countries with universal healthcare include Austria, Belarus, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Isle of Man, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Moldova, Norway, Poland, Portugal,Portugal: Bentes M, Dias CM, Sakellarides C, Bankauskaite V.

Retrieved October 16, 2011. Austria has a two-tier payment system in which many individuals receive basic publicly funded care; they also have the option to purchase supplementary private health insurance. =Belgium= Healthcare in Belgium is composed of three parts. Firstly there is a primarily publicly funded healthcare and social security service run by the federal government, which organises and regulates healthcare; independent private/public practitioners, university/semi-private hospitals and care institutions. There are a few (commercially run for-profit) private hospitals. Secondly is the insurance coverage provided for patients. Finally, industry coverage covers the production and distribution of healthcare products for research and development. The primary aspect of this research is done in universities and hospitals. =Croatia= Croatia has a universal health care system that provides medical services and is coordinated by the Ministry of Health. The population is covered by a basic health insurance plan provided by statute and by optional insurance. It is administered by the Croatian Health Insurance Fund. In 2012, annual compulsory healthcare related expenditures reached 21.0 billion kunas (c. 2.8 billion euro). There are hundreds of healthcare institutions in Croatia, including 79 hospitals and clinics with 25,285 beds, caring for more than 760 thousand patients per year, 5,792 private practice offices and 79 emergency medical service units. =Czech Republic= Czech Republic has a universal public health system paid largely from taxation. Private health care systems do co-exist freely alongside public ones, sometimes offering better quality or faster service. Almost all medical services are covered by health insurance and insurance companies, though certain services such as prescription drugs or vision and dental care are only covered partially. =Denmark= Denmark has a universal public health system paid largely from taxation with local municipalities delivering health care services in the same way as other Scandinavian countries. Primary care is provided by a general practitioner service run by private doctors contracting with the local municipalities with payment on a mixed per capita and fee for service basis. Most hospitals are run by the municipalities (only 1% of hospital beds are in the private sector). =Finland= In Finland, public medical services at clinics and hospitals are run by the municipalities (local government) and are funded 76% by taxation, 20% by patients through access charges, and 4% by others. Private provision is mainly in the primary care sector. There are a few private hospitals. The main hospitals are either municipally owned (funded from local taxes) or run by the medical teaching universities (funded jointly by the municipalities and the national government). According to a survey published by the European Commission in 2000, Finland's is in the top 4 of EU countries in terms of satisfaction with their hospital care system: 88% of Finnish respondents were satisfied compared with the EU average of 41.3%. Finnish health care expenditures are below the European average. The private medical sector accounts for about 14 percent of total health care spending. Only 8% of doctors choose to work in private practice, and some of these also choose to do some work in the public sector. Taxation funding is partly local and partly nationally based. The national social insurance institution KELA reimburses part of patients prescription costs and makes a contribution towards private medical costs (including dentistry) if they choose to be treated in the private sector rather than the public sector. Patient access charges are subject to annual caps. For example, GP visits cost ‚Ç¨11 per visit with annual ‚Ç¨33 cap; hospital outpatient treatment ‚Ç¨22 per visit; a hospital stay, including food, medical care and medicines ‚Ç¨26 per 24 hours, or ‚Ç¨12 if in a psychiatric hospital. After a patient has spent ‚Ç¨683 per year on public medical services, all further treatment in that year is covered (although the required initial deductible is reviewed annually, so it may vary). There is a separate reimbursement system for prescribed medicine: after paying ‚Ç¨578 per year, the remaining bought medicine will have a maximum price of ‚Ç¨2.50 per purchase.https://www.kela.fi/web/en/medicine-expenses?inheritRedirect=true Finland has a highly decentralized three-level public system of health care and alongside this, a much smaller private health-care system. Overall, the municipalities (funded by taxation, local and national) meet about two thirds of all medical-care costs, with the remaining one third paid by the national insurance system (nationally funded), and by private finance (either employer- funded or met by patients themselves). Private inpatient care forms about 3‚Äì4% of all inpatient care. In 1999 only 17 per cent of total funding for health care came from insurance, comprising 14.9% statutory (government) insurance and 2.1% private health insurance. Eyeglasses are not publicly subsidized at all, although dentistry is available as a municipal service or can be obtained privately with partial reimbursement from the state. The percentage of total health expenditure financed by taxation in Finland (78%)http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/52/33/38976604.pdf is above the OECD average and similar to the levels seen in Germany (77%) and France (80%) but below the level seen in the UK (87%). The quality of service in Finnish health care, as measured by patient satisfaction, is excellent. According to a survey published by the European Commission in 2000, Finland has one of the highest ratings of patient satisfaction with their hospital care system in the EU: 88% of Finnish respondents were satisfied compared with the EU average of 41.3%.http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_283_en.pdf European Commission: Health and long-term care in the European Union There are caps on total medical expenses that are met out-of-pocket for drugs and hospital treatments. The National Insurance system pays all necessary costs over these caps. Public spending on health care in 2006 was 13.6 billion euros (equivalent to US$338 per person per month). The increase over 2005 at 8.2 per cent was below the OECD average of 9 percent. Household budgets directly met 18.7 per cent of all health-care costs.\\"News item on healthcare costs in 2006 (in Finnish)\\". =France= France has a system of health care largely financed by government through a system of national health insurance. Nonetheless, not all medical care is paid for by the state, with only 70% of initial GP care covered and anywhere between 35% and 100% of prescription medication covered. It is consistently ranked as one of the best in the world. =Germany= The Charit√© (Hospital) in Berlin Germany has the world's oldest national social health insurance system, with origins dating back to Otto von Bismarck's Sickness Insurance Law of 1883. The system is decentralized with private practice physicians providing ambulatory care, and independent, mostly non-profit hospitals providing the majority of inpatient care. Employers pay for half of their employees' health insurance contributions, while self- employed workers pay the entire contribution themselves. Approximately 90% of the population is covered by a statutory health insurance plan, which provides a standardized level of coverage through any one of approximately 100 public sickness funds. The rest are covered by private health insurance. Private health insurance is only accessible to self-employed workers, and to high- income employees. The contributions for public insurance is determined according to income, while the contributions for private health insurance are determined according to age and health condition. Historically, the level of provider reimbursement for specific services is determined through negotiations between regional physician's associations and sickness funds. Since 1976 the government has convened an annual commission, composed of representatives of business, labor, physicians, hospitals, and insurance and pharmaceutical industries. The commission takes into account government policies and makes recommendations to regional associations with respect to overall expenditure targets. In 1986 expenditure caps were implemented and were tied to the age of the local population as well as the overall wage increases. Although reimbursement of providers is on a fee-for-service basis, the amount to be reimbursed for each service is determined retrospectively to ensure that spending targets are not exceeded. Capitated care, such as that provided by U.S. health maintenance organizations, has been considered as a cost containment mechanism but would require consent of regional medical associations, and has not materialized. Copayments were introduced in the 1980s in an attempt to prevent overutilization and control costs. The average length of hospital stay in Germany has decreased in recent years from 14 days to 9 days, still considerably longer than average stays in the U.S. (5 to 6 days). The difference is partly driven by the fact that hospital reimbursement is chiefly a function of the number of hospital days as opposed to procedures or the patient's diagnosis. Drug costs have increased substantially, rising nearly 60% from 1991 through 2005. Despite attempts to contain costs, overall health care expenditures rose to 10.7% of GDP in 2005, comparable to other western European nations, but substantially less than that spent in the U.S. (nearly 16% of GDP). =Greece= The Greek healthcare system provides high quality medical services to insured citizens and is coordinated by the Ministry for Health and Social Solidarity. Public health services are provided by the National Healthcare Service, or ESY (). In 2010 there were 35,000 hospital beds and 131 hospitals in the country. The Greek healthcare system has received high rankings by the World Health Organization, ranked 14th in the overall assessment and 11th in quality of service in a 2000 report by the WHO. However, it must be noted that the entire financial system collapsed in 2007‚Äì2008. The data listed above is from 2000. =Guernsey / Jersey= The medical care system in the Channel Islands is very similar to that of the UK in that many of the doctors and nurses have been trained from the UK health perspective. There is universal health care for residents of the islands. =Iceland= Iceland has a universal public health system paid largely from taxation with local municipalities delivering health care services in the same way as other Scandinavian countries. Iceland's entire population has equal access to health care services. =Ireland= The public health care system of the Republic of Ireland is governed by the Health Act 2004, which established a new body to be responsible for providing health and personal social services to everyone living in Ireland ‚Äì the Health Service Executive. The new national health service came into being officially on January 1, 2005; however, the new structures are currently in the process of being established as the reform program continues. In addition to the public-sector, there is a large private health care market. In Ireland, 37% of the population have a means tested medical card that gives the holder access to tax-funded GP care and requires ‚Ç¨2.00 for each prescription drug. The standard charge for Irish and EU citizens who attend the A&E; in hospitals is ‚Ç¨100. This is free of charge if referred by a GP.https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/acute-hospitals- division/patient-care/hospital-charges/ For all other residents who do not have a medical card, the average price for an appointment with a family doctor GP is ‚Ç¨50 or ‚Ç¨70 for an emergency appointment with a Caredoc GP. =Isle of Man= The Isle of Man provides universal public health coverage to its residents. =Italy= Italy has a public health care service for all the residents called \\"Servizio Sanitario Nazionale\\" or SSN (National Health Service). It is publicly run and funded mostly from taxation. Some services require variable co-pays, while other services (like emergency medicine and a general doctor) are free. There is also a small parallel private health care system, especially in the field of dentistry and optometry. =Luxembourg= Luxembourg provides universal health care coverage to all residents (Luxembourgers and foreigners) by the National Health Insurance (CNS - Caisse nationale de sant√© (French) or National Gesondheetskeess (Luxembourgish)). It is funded by mandatory contributions of employers and the workforce, and by government subsidies for insuring jobseekers, the poor, and for financing medical infrastructure. The nation also has mandatory public long-term care insurance. =Netherlands= The Netherlands has a dual-level system. All primary and curative care (family doctors, hospitals, and clinics) is financed from private compulsory insurance. Long-term care for the elderly, the dying, the long term mentally ill etc. is covered by social insurance funded from taxation. According to the WHO, the health care system in the Netherlands was 62% government funded and 38% privately funded as of 2004. Insurance companies must offer a core universal insurance package for universal primary, curative care, including the cost of all prescription medicines. They must do this at a fixed price for all. People pay the same premium whether young or old, healthy or sick. It is illegal in The Netherlands for insurers to refuse an application for health insurance, to impose special conditions (e.g., exclusions, deductibles, co-pays etc., or refuse to fund treatments that a doctor has determined are medically necessary). The system is 50% financed from payroll taxes paid by employers to a fund controlled by the Health regulator. The government contributes an additional 5% to the regulator's fund. The remaining 45% is collected as premiums paid by the insured directly to the insurance company. Some employers negotiate bulk deals with health insurers and some even pay the employees' premiums as an employment benefit. The regulator has sight of the claims made by policyholders and therefore can redistribute the funds its holds on the basis of relative claims made by policy holders. Thus insurers with high payouts receive more from the regulator than those with low payouts. Insurance companies have no incentive to deter high cost individuals from taking insurance and are compensated if they have to pay out more than might be expected. Insurance companies compete with each other on price for the 45% direct premium part of the funding and try to negotiate deals with hospitals to keep costs low and quality high. The competition regulator is charged with checking for abuse of dominant market positions and the creation of cartels that act against the consumer interests. An insurance regulator ensures that all basic policies have identical coverage rules so that no person is medically disadvantaged by his or her choice of insurer. Hospitals in the Netherlands are also regulated and inspected but are mostly privately run and not for profit, as are many of the insurance companies. Patients can choose where they want to be treated, and have access to information on the internet about the performance and waiting times at each hospital. Patients dissatisfied with their insurer and choice of hospital can cancel at any time, but must make a new agreement with another insurer. Insurance companies can offer additional services at extra cost over and above the universal system laid down by the regulator, e.g., for dental care. The standard monthly premium for health care paid by individual adults is about ‚Ç¨100 per month. Persons with low incomes can get assistance from the government if they cannot afford these payments. Children under 18 are insured by the system at no additional cost to them or their families because the insurance company receives the cost of this from the regulator's fund. There is a fixed yearly deductible of ‚Ç¨385 for each adult person, excluding first visits for diagnosis to general physicians. =Norway= Norway has a universal public health system paid largely from taxation in the same way as other Scandinavian countries. The Norwegian health care system is government- funded and heavily decentralized. The health care system in Norway is financed primarily through taxes levied by county councils and municipalities. Dental care is included for children until 18 years old, and is covered for adults for some ailments. Norway regularly comes top or close to the top of worldwide healthcare rankings. =Portugal= Portugal's National Healthcare Service, known nationally as Servi√ßo Nacional de Sa√∫de (SNS), is a universal and free healthcare service provided nationwide since 1979 and available to both Portuguese and foreign residents. In 2014, Portugal SNS ranked 13th best healthcare service in Europe. The National Medical Emergency Institute (INEM) is the main emergency medical service and can be activated by calling 112. =Romania= According to Article 34 of the Constitution of Romania, the state is obliged \\"to guarantee the protection of healthcare\\". Romania has a fully universal healthcare system, which covers medical check-ups, any surgical interventions, and any postoperative medical care, as well as free or subsidized medicine for a range of diseases. The state is also obliged to fund public hospitals and clinics. Dental care is not funded by the state, although there are public dental clinics in some hospitals, which treat patients free of charge. However, due to inadequate funding and corruption, it is estimated that a third of medical expenses are, in some cases, supported by the patient. Furthermore, Romania spends, per capita, less than any other EU state on medical care. =Russia and former Soviet Union= In the former Soviet Union, the preferred term was \\"socialist medicine\\"; the Russian language has no term to distinguish between \\"socialist\\" and \\"socialized\\" (other than \\"public\\", Rus: obshchestvenniy/–æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π, sometimes \\"collectivized\\" or \\"nationalized\\", Rus: obobshchestvlenniy/–æ–±–æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–ª–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π).Zhuraleva et al., Teaching History of Medicine in Russia. Russia in Soviet times (between 1917 and 1991) had a totally socialist model of health care with a centralized, integrated, hierarchically organised with the government providing free health care to all citizens. Quality of care and access to medications was not equal however and was dependent on the social status of patient. The best care was provided for nomenklatura and their family members, who had segregated from the rest of population facilities, such as Kremlin hospital.Natalya Rapoport Untold Stories of Pioneers in Medical Sciences Under Stalin's Tyranny 304 pages, 2020 Initially successful at combating infectious diseases, the effectiveness of the socialized model declined with underinvestment. Despite a doubling in the number of hospital beds and doctors per capita between 1950 and 1980, the quality of care began to decline by the early 1980s and medical care and health outcomes were below western standards. The new mixed economy Russia has switched to a mixed model of health care with private financing and provision running alongside state financing and provision. The OECD reported that unfortunately, none of this has worked out as planned and the reforms have in many respects made the system worse. The population's health has deteriorated on virtually every measure. The resulting system is overly complex and very inefficient. It has little in common with the model envisaged by the reformers. Although there are more than 300 private insurers and numerous public ones in the market, real competition for patients is rare leaving most patients with little or no effective choice of insurer, and in many places, no choice of health care provider either. The insurance companies have failed to develop as active, informed purchasers of health care services. Most are passive intermediaries, making money by simply channelling funds from regional OMS funds to healthcare providers. Article 41 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation confirms a citizen's right to state healthcare and medical assistance free of charge. This is achieved through state compulsory medical insurance (OMS), which is funded by an obligatory medical insurance payroll tax and government subsidies. It worth mentioning that Russian citizens never pay taxes for themselves and often doesn't even know how much taxes do they pay, because tax payment process is maintained by companies they are working on.https://www.rline.tv/news/2018-11-19-v-rossii-grazhdane-platyat-odni-iz- samykh-vysokikh-nalogov-my-podschitali-i-uzhasnulis/ Introduction in 1993 reform of new free market providers in addition to the state-run institutions intended to promote both efficiency and patient choice. A purchaser-provider split help facilitate the restructuring of care, as resources would migrate to where there was greatest demand, reduce the excess capacity in the hospital sector and stimulate the development of primary care. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin announced a new large-scale health care reform in 2011 and pledged to allocate more than 300 billion rubles ($10 billion) in the next few years to improve health care in the country. As of 2020 the health insurance tax (called deposition to an OMS fund) is 5.1%.http://www.ffoms.gov.ru/system- oms/about-fund/formation-of-income/strakhovye-vznosy-na-oms/ =Serbia= The Constitution of the Republic of Serbia states that it is a right of every citizen to seek medical assistance free of charge. This is achieved by mutual contribution to the Compulsory Social Healthcare Fund of RZZO (Republiƒçki Zavod za Zdravstveno Osiguranje or National Health Insurance Institution). The amount of contribution depends on the amount of money the person is making. During the 1990s, Serbia's healthcare system has been of a poor quality due to severe underfunding. In the recent years, however, that has changed and the Serbian government has invested heavily in new medical infrastructure, completely remodeling existing hospitals and building two new hospitals in Novi Sad and Kragujevac. =Spain= Spain provides a public universal health care system for all citizens and, under certain conditions, also non-citizens. Healthcare is free except for co-payments in some products and services; it is mostly paid from the Social Security budget. Adult dental care is not covered but for basic extractions or problems that could result in serious stomatological conditions. Irrespective of the nationality and insurance situation of the patient, the public system always treats medical emergencies until achieving the best possible outcome. If not covered by the Spanish Social Security (i.e., a visiting foreigner), the provider later negotiates payment with the patient or the patient's insurer. If actually unable to pay, it is covered by the Social Security on humanitarian grounds unless the patient purposely traveled to Spain to get free healthcare. Obvious unexpected emergencies like accidental injuries or sudden illness are customarily covered, but those that could be reasonably expected (e.g., arising from a chronic condition or from avoidable risk-taking) are studied on a case-per- case basis. According to the World Economic Forum and to Bloomberg, Spain has the most efficient health system in Europe, and also ranks at the top worldwide along with Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore. Private health insurance is available for those who prefer it, and recommended for visitors not covered by the Spanish Social Security or a foreign public or private insurer with overseas coverage. =Sweden= Sweden has a universal public health care system paid for through taxation. The Swedish public and private health care systems are funded through taxes levied by the county councils. Government- paid dental care is accessible for those under 23 years old. Sweden also has a smaller private health care sector, mainly in larger cities or as centers for preventive health care financed by employers. In recent years the health care system of Sweden has been heavily criticized for not providing the same quality of health care to all Swedish citizens. The disparity of health care quality in Sweden is growing. Swedish citizens of other ethnicities than Swedish, and citizens who are of a lower socio-economic class receive a significantly lower quality of health care than the rest of the population. This was especially brought to light during the COVID-19 pandemic as Swedish media and public health researchers pointed out that Swedish citizens of other ethnicities than Swedish and people living in working class areas were dying from COVID-19 at a significantly higher rate than the rest of the population, due to the fact that they were not provided with the same quality of health care as the rest of the population. =Switzerland= Purchasing basic health insurance is mandatory for all persons residing in Switzerland (within three months of taking up residence or being born in the country). Healthcare in Switzerland is universally available and is regulated by the Federal Health Insurance Act of 1994. Supplemental insurance plans are optional. Insurers are required to offer insurance to everyone, regardless of age or medical condition. They are not allowed to make a profit off this basic insurance, but can on supplemental plans. =United Kingdom= Each of the countries of the United Kingdom has a National Health Service that provides public healthcare to all UK permanent residents that was originally designed to be free at the point of need and paid for from general taxation; but changes included introducing charging for prescription medicines and dentistry (those below 16 and those on certain benefits may still get free treatment). However, since health is now a devolved matter, considerable differences are developing between the systems in each of the countries as for example Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales abolished prescription charges.NHS now four different systems BBC January 2, 2008 Private healthcare companies are free to operate alongside the public system. England Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, a National Health Service hospital. The National Health Service (NHS), created by the National Health Service Act 1946, has provided the majority of healthcare in England since its launch on July 5, 1948. The NHS Constitution for England documents, at high level, the objectives of the NHS, the legal rights and responsibilities of the various parties (patients, staff, NHS trust boards), and the guiding principles that govern the service. The NHS constitution makes it clear that it provides a comprehensive service, available to all irrespective of age, gender, disability, race, sexual orientation, religion, or belief; that access to NHS services is based on clinical need and not an individual's ability to pay; and that care is never refused on unreasonable grounds. Patient choice in terms of doctor, care, treatments, and place of treatment is an important aspect of the NHS's ambition, and in some cases patients can elect for treatment in other European countries at the NHS's expense. Waiting times are low, with most people able to see their primary care doctor on the same day or the following day. Only 36.1% of hospital admissions are from a waiting list, with the remainder being either emergencies admitted immediately or else pre-booked admissions or the like (e.g., child birth). One of the main goals of care management is to ensure that patients do not experience a delay of more than 18 weeks from initial hospital referral to final treatment, inclusive of time for all associated investigative tests and consultations. At present, two-thirds of patients are treated in under 12 weeks. Though centrally funded, the NHS is not managed by a large central bureaucracy. Responsibility is divided among geographical areas through strategic health authorities. Management is distributed even more locally through primary care trusts, hospital trusts‚Äîand increasingly to NHS foundation trusts that providing even more decentralized services within the NHS framework, with more decisions left to local people, patients, and staff. The central government office‚Äîthe Department of Health‚Äîis not involved in day-to-day decision making in either the Strategic Health Authorities or the individual local trusts (primarily health, hospital, or ambulance) or the national specialist trusts such as NHS Blood and Transplant. It does lay down general guidelines they must follow. Local trusts are accountable to their local populations, whilst government ministers are accountable to Parliament for the service overall. The NHS provides, among other things, primary care, in-patient care, long-term healthcare, psychiatric care and treatments, ophthalmology, and dentistry. All treatment is taxpayer- funded with the exception of certain charges for prescriptions, dentistry and ophthalmology (which themselves are free to children, certain students in full-time education, the elderly, the unemployed and those on low incomes). Around 89 percent of NHS prescriptions are obtained free of charge, mostly for children, pensioners, and pregnant women. Others pay a flat rate of ¬£9.00, and others may cap their annual charges by purchasing an NHS Prescription Prepayment Certificate. Private health care has continued parallel to the NHS, paid for largely by private insurance. Private insurance accounts for only 4 percent of health expenditure and covers little more than a tenth of the population. Private insurers in the UK only cover acute care from specialists. They do not cover generalist consultations, pre-existing conditions, medical emergencies, organ transplants, chronic conditions such as diabetes, or conditions such as pregnancy or HIV.Are you buying private medical insurance? Association of British Insurers Most NHS general practitioners are private doctors who contract to provide NHS services, but most hospitals are publicly owned and run through NHS trusts. A few NHS medical services (such as \\"surgicentres\\") are sub-contracted to private providers as are some non- medical services (such as catering). Some capital projects such as new hospitals have been funded through the Private Finance Initiative, enabling investment without (in the short term) increasing the public sector borrowing requirement, because long-term contractually obligated PFI spending commitments are not counted as government liabilities. Northern Ireland Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland is the designation of the national public health service in Northern Ireland. Scotland The Royal Aberdeen Children's Hospital is a specialist children's hospital within NHS Scotland. NHS Scotland, created by the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1947, was also launched on July 5, 1948, although it has always been a separate organization. Since devolution, NHS Scotland has followed the policies and priorities of the Scottish Government, including the phasing out of all prescription charges by 2011. Wales NHS Wales was originally formed as part of the same NHS structure created by the National Health Service Act 1946 but powers over the NHS in Wales came under the Secretary of State for Wales in 1969,Introduction to NHS Wales 1960's www.wales.nhs.uk in turn being transferred under devolution to what is now the Welsh Government. Oceania Australia and New Zealand have universal health care. It is not entirely free as it only covers 75% or 85% of scheduled costs and healthcare providers usually charge more than the scheduled costs so patients can be asked to pay up to 25% of the scheduled costs plus any amount over the scheduled cost that is required by the healthcare provider. =Australia= In Australia, Medibank‚Äîas it was then known‚Äîwas introduced, by the Whitlam Labor government on July 1, 1975, through the Health Insurance Act 1973. The Australian Senate rejected the changes multiple times and they were passed only after a joint sitting after the 1974 double dissolution election. However, Medibank was supported by the subsequent Fraser Coalition (Australia) government and became a key feature of Australia's public policy landscape. The exact structure of Medibank/Medicare, in terms of the size of the rebate to doctors and hospitals and the way it has administered, has varied over the years. The original Medibank program proposed a 1.35% levy (with low income exemptions) but these bills were rejected by the Senate, and so Medibank was funded from general taxation. In 1976, the Fraser Government introduced a 2.5% levy and split Medibank in two: a universal scheme called Medibank Public and a government-owned private health insurance company, Medibank Private. During the 1980s, Medibank Public was renamed Medicare by the Hawke Labor government, which also changed the funding model, to an income tax surcharge, known as the Medicare Levy, which was set at 1.5%, with exemptions for low income earners. The Howard Coalition government introduced an additional levy of 1.0%, known as the Medicare Levy Surcharge, for those on high annual incomes ($70,000) who do not have adequate levels of private hospital coverage. This was part of an effort by the Coalition to encourage take-up of private health insurance. According to WHO, government funding covered 67.5% of Australia's health care expenditures in 2004; private sources covered the remaining 32.5% of expenditures. As of 2019, the Medicare levy is 2% of taxable income, with a Medicare levy surcharge, for those on high income who do not have appropriate private patient hospital cover (1% for singles on $90,000 pa and families on $180,000 pa, rising to 1.5% for higher incomes). =New Zealand= As with Australia, New Zealand's healthcare system is funded through general taxation according to the Social Security Act 1938. However, aside from hospitalisation, there are user charges for prescriptions (introduced in February 1985) and partial subsidisation of general practitioner visits with additional provision for those on low or modest incomes known as Community Service Cards (introduced on February 1, 1992) to target healthcare based on income.Community Service Cards Authored by Steve Maharey, former Minister of Social Development New Zealand Parliamentary Debates, September 19, 1985, pg 6,971Healthcare Authored by Michael Bassett, former Minister of Health between 1984 and 1987 These changes were part of broader controversial policies introduced by the Fourth National Government between 1991 and 1993 and effectively ended largely free provision of primary healthcare. According to the WHO, government sources covered 77.4% of New Zealand's health care costs in 2004; private expenditures covered the remaining 22.6%. Historic attempts to bring general practitioner care into government ownership have been largely unfulfilled. There are twenty district health boards as of 2019 whose task is ensuring the provision of health and disability services to populations within a defined geographical area and are partially elected while the remainder is appointed by New Zealand's Minister of Health. from Ministry of Health, last updated January 2005 This system of management came into being on January 1, 2001, abolishing the much controversial Crown Health Enterprises regime which had replaced Area Health Boards previously.

Data science is related to data mining, machine learning and big data. Data science is a \\"concept to unify statistics, data analysis and their related methods\\" in order to \\"understand and analyze actual phenomena\\" with data. It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, domain knowledge and information science. Turing award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a \\"fourth paradigm\\" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational and now data-driven) and asserted that \\"everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology\\" and the data deluge. __TOC__  Foundations  Data science is an interdisciplinary field focused on extracting knowledge from data sets, which are typically large (see big data). The field encompasses analysis, preparing data for analysis, and presenting findings to inform high-level decisions in an organization. As such, it incorporates skills from computer science, mathematics, statistics, information visualization, graphic design, complex systems, communication and business. Statistician Nathan Yau, drawing on Ben Fry, also links data science to human-computer interaction: users should be able to intuitively control and explore data. In 2015, the American Statistical Association identified database management, statistics and machine learning, and distributed and parallel systems as the three emerging foundational professional communities. =Relationship to statistics= Many statisticians, including Nate Silver, have argued that data science is not a new field, but rather another name for statistics. Others argue that data science is distinct from statistics because it focuses on problems and techniques unique to digital data. Vasant Dhar writes that statistics emphasizes quantitative data and description. In contrast, data science deals with quantitative and qualitative data (e.g. images) and emphasizes prediction and action. Andrew Gelman of Columbia University and data scientist Vincent Granville have described statistics as a nonessential part of data science. Stanford professor David Donoho writes that data science is not distinguished from statistics by the size of datasets or use of computing, and that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data science program. He describes data science as an applied field growing out of traditional statistics. In summary, data science can be therefore described as an applied branch of statistics.  Etymology  = Early usage = In 1962, John Tukey described a field he called ‚Äúdata analysis,‚Äù which resembles modern data science. Later, attendees at a 1992 statistics symposium at the University of Montpellier II acknowledged the emergence of a new discipline focused on data of various origins and forms, combining established concepts and principles of statistics and data analysis with computing. The term ‚Äúdata science‚Äù has been traced back to 1974, when Peter Naur proposed it as an alternative name for computer science. In 1996, the International Federation of Classification Societies became the first conference to specifically feature data science as a topic. However, the definition was still in flux. In 1997, C.F. Jeff Wu suggested that statistics should be renamed data science. He reasoned that a new name would help statistics shed inaccurate stereotypes, such as being synonymous with accounting, or limited to describing data. In 1998, Chikio Hayashi argued for data science as a new, interdisciplinary concept, with three aspects: data design, collection, and analysis. During the 1990s, popular terms for the process of finding patterns in datasets (which were increasingly large) included ‚Äúknowledge discovery‚Äù and ‚Äúdata mining.‚Äù = Modern usage = The modern conception of data science as an independent discipline is sometimes attributed to William S. Cleveland. In a 2001 paper, he advocated an expansion of statistics beyond theory into technical areas; because this would significantly change the field, it warranted a new name. \\"Data science\\" became more widely used in the next few years: in 2002, the Committee on Data for Science and Technology launched Data Science Journal. In 2003, Columbia University launched The Journal of Data Science. In 2014, the American Statistical Association's Section on Statistical Learning and Data Mining changed its name to the Section on Statistical Learning and Data Science, reflecting the ascendant popularity of data science. The professional title of ‚Äúdata scientist‚Äù has been attributed to DJ Patil and Jeff Hammerbacher in 2008. Though it was used by the National Science Board in their 2005 report, \\"Long-Lived Digital Data Collections: Enabling Research and Education in the 21st Century,\\" it referred broadly to any key role in managing a digital data collection. There is still no consensus on the definition of data science and it is considered by some to be a buzzword.  Careers in data science  Data science is a growing field. A career as a data scientist is ranked as the third best job in America for 2020 by Glassdoor, and was ranked the number one best job from 2016 to 2019. = Educational path = In order to become a data scientist, there is a significant amount of education and experience required. The first step in becoming a data scientist is to earn a bachelor's degree, typically in a quantitative field. Coding bootcamps are also available and can be used as an alternate pre-qualification to supplement a bachelor's degree. Most data scientists also complete a master‚Äôs degree or a PhD in a quantitative/scientific field. Once these qualifications are met, the next step to becoming a data scientist is to apply for an entry-level job in the field. Some data scientists may later choose to specialize in a sub-field of data science. = Specializations and associated careers = * Machine Learning Scientist: Machine learning scientists research new methods of data analysis and create algorithms. * Data Engineer: Data Engineers prepare the ‚Äúbig data‚Äù infrastructure to be analyzed by Data Scientists. They are software engineers who design, build, integrate data from various resources, and manage big data. * Data Analyst: Data analysts utilize large data sets to gather information that meets their company‚Äôs needs. * Data Consultant: Data consultants work with businesses to determine the best usage of the information yielded from data analysis. * Data Architect: Data architects build data solutions that are optimized for performance and design applications. * Applications Architect: Applications architects track how applications are used throughout a business and how they interact with users and other applications.  Impacts of data science  Big data is very quickly becoming a vital tool for businesses and companies of all sizes. The availability and interpretation of big data has altered the business models of old industries and enabled the creation of new ones. Data-driven businesses are worth $1.2 trillion collectively in 2020, an increase from $333 billion in the year 2015. Data scientists are responsible for breaking down big data into usable information and creating software and algorithms that help companies and organizations determine optimal operations. As big data continues to have a major impact on the world, data science does as well due to the close relationship between the two.  Technologies and techniques  There are a variety of different technologies and techniques that are used for data science which depend on the application. More recently, full-featured, end-to- end platforms have been developed and heavily used for data science and machine learning. = Techniques = * Linear Regression * Logistic Regression * Decision tree * Support Vector Machine (SVM) * Clustering is a technique used to group data together. * Dimensionality reduction is used to reduce the complexity of data computation so that it can be performed more quickly. * Machine learning is a technique used to perform tasks by inferencing patterns from data. = Languages = * Python is a programming language with simple syntax that is commonly used for data science. There are a number of python libraries that are used in data science including numpy, pandas, and scipy. * R is a programming language that was designed for statisticians and data mining and is optimized for computation. * Julia is a high-level, high- performance, dynamic programming language well-suited for numerical analysis and computational science. = Frameworks = * TensorFlow is a framework for creating machine learning models developed by Google. * Pytorch is another framework for machine learning developed by Facebook. * Jupyter Notebook is an interactive web interface for Python that allows faster experimentation. * Apache Hadoop is a software framework that is used to process data over large distributed systems. = Visualization Tools = * Plotly provides a rich set of interactive scientific graphing libraries. * Tableau makes a variety of software that is used for data visualization. * PowerBI is a business analytics service by Microsoft. * Qlik produces software such as QlikView and Qlik Sense used for data visualization and business intelligence. * AnyChart provides JavaScript libraries and other tools for data visualization in charts and dashboards. * Google Charts is a JavaScript-based web service made and supported by Google for creating graphical charts. * Sisense provides a front- end for building data visualizations including dashboards and reports. * Webix is a UI toolkit that includes dedicated tools for information visualization. = Platforms = * RapidMiner is a data science software platform developed by the company of the same name. *Dataiku is a collaborative data science software marketed for big data. *Anaconda provides a comprehensive free and open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages. * MATLAB is a computing environment heavily used in industry and academia. * Databricks is a cloud platform for massive scale data engineering and collaborative data science.

It is native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, where it is known from a part of the Cascade Mountains in Washington and Oregon.Sisyrinchium sarmentosum. The Nature Conservancy. This perennial herb grows up to 32 centimeters tall. The grasslike leaves, located around the base of the plant, are linear in shape and up to 20 centimeters long. Each flower has six pale blue tepals with yellow bases. They are a centimeter long or slightly longer. Each has a rounded tip with a bristle in the center. The fruit is a rounded brown capsule half a centimeter long.Sisyrinchium sarmentosum. Flora of North America.Sisyrinchium sarmentosum. Washington Burke Museum. Flowering occurs in June at lower elevations and July at higher. The flowers open in late morning or mid-day.Sisyrinchium sarmentosum. Center for Plant Conservation. This plant grows in mountain meadows in southern Washington and northern Oregon. Most of the 22 known populations are found within the Gifford Pinchot and Mt. Hood National Forests.Sisyrinchium sarmentosum. USDA Forest Service: Celebrating Wildflowers. The plants occur at elevations within the Pacific silver fir and grand fir zones. The habitat is usually wet, and snowy during the winter. The meadows are surrounded by conifers and meadow species may include Deschampsia cespitosa, Alopecurus pratensis, Phleum pratense, Poa palustris, Juncus tenuis, Juncus ensifolius, Carex vesicaria, Carex microptera, Agrostis idahoensis, Fragaria virginiana var. platypetala, Prunella vulgaris, Trifolium repens, Potentilla drummondii, Ranunculus flammula, Solidago canadensis, Veronica scutellata, Botrychium multifidum, Antennaria microphylla and Viola adunca. This plant reproduces sexually and by cloning. Grazing by cattle reduces the plant's ability to reproduce by seed, so cloning is often more common. This tends to reduce the genetic diversity of populations, so grazing is a major threat to the species. At least 82% of all the plants are located on one grazing allotment on the Gifford Pinchot National Forest.Conservation agreement for pale blue eyed grass (Sisyrinchium sarmentosum), in Oregon and Washington. Gifford Pinchot, Mt. Hood, and Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forests. Fire suppression is another threat. When the natural fire regime is prevented, large and woody vegetation encroaches on the plant's meadow habitat, producing competition and shade. Invasive species of plants are a threat, including Cynoglossum officinale, Senecio jacobaea, Cirsium arvense, and Cirsium vulgare. Other threats include recreation, hybridization with Sisyrinchium idahoense, and logging.

His 1838 official memorial to the Daoguang Emperor detailing the problems caused by opium helped lead to the appointment of Lin Zexu as Imperial Commissioner responsible for tackling the opium problem, p 53 a move that would ultimately result in the First Opium War with Great Britain. Early life and career Born in Yihuang County, Jiangxi Province, by the age of seven Huang could compose classical poetry. In 1808 during the reign of the Qing Jiaqing Emperor he entered the government school and in 1823 graduated as a chosen scholar or J√¨nsh√¨ (ËøõÂ£´/ÈÄ≤Â£´). Thereafter he held a series of positions at the Imperial Court including Imperial Censor (Âæ°Âè≤Y√π sh«ê), Minister of Works (Â∑•ÁßëÁªô‰∫ã‰∏≠G≈çngkƒì gƒõi sh√¨ zh≈çng) and Minister Herald (È∏øËÉ™ÂØ∫Âçø/È¥ªËáöÂØ∫Âçø H√≥ng l√∫ s√¨ qƒ´ng).Draft History of Qing Biography Number 165 Petition to the emperor By the early years of the Daoguang Emperor's reign, the pernicious influence of opium had spread all across China, leading to a serious outflow of silver bullion and a society wide crisis. In 1838, Huang, by now Minister Herald, presented the emperor with a petition entitled \\"Plug the leak firmly to grow the country\\" (‰∏•Â°ûÊºèÂçÆ‰ª•ÂüπÂõΩÊú¨Áñè Y√°n s√® l√≤u √® y«ê p√©i gu√≥ bƒõn sh≈´) - the leak in question being of silver bullion. In his memorial Huang asked the emperor to grant a one-year period of grace after which ordinary citizens who continued to smoke opium would face the death penalty while officials would face the same punishment with their offspring banned from sitting the imperial examination. The petition gained the support of officials including Lin Zexu and Tao Zhu, as well as praise from the emperor himself. On the eve of the First Opium War, Huang knew that control of China's coastal regions was vital to the suppression of the opium trade. He made two trips to Fujian Province and presented the emperor with a map showing suggested coastal defences, the H«éif√°ng t√∫bi«éo (). Later career When the First Opium War broke out in 1839, Huang joined Deng Tingzhen in resisting the British army then later took charge of the Yuzhang Confucian Academy (). He died in Beijing in 1853; thereafter his body was returned to Yihuang County for burial.

The traditional banked design allows access to multiple levels within the barn from ground level on the outside, as the foundation is cut into a slope. Located on private property, the barn fell into disrepair and finally collapsed inward in 2010. The foundation and collapsed walls remain at the site as of 2012. The structure was added to the New Jersey Historic Register on July 29, 1981. Since the 1970s the property has been privately owned by the Cook, Jones, and Harris families respectively. As of 2012 the property had changed hands to the McGrogan family. Significance Bank Barn presents historic significance to the region as it was one of the few remaining structures of its kind. The barn's design demonstrated the pioneering ingenuity of early settlers who, faced with an un-plowable hillside and lack of motorized winch and lift systems, utilized the landscape to their benefit through constructing a second floor that they could simply drive up to.

They are unique in being able to ‚Äúlock in‚Äù work applied to them through an alteration in hydrogen bonding, which enables them to be processed with approximately 1000 times less energy than standard polymers. This has been recently shown for an archetypal biopolymer, silk, however the mechanism for solidification is thought to be inherent to many other biological materials. Discovery and mechanism Aquamelts were defined as a new class of polymeric material as a result of a comparison between the spinning feedstock of the Chinese silkworm (Bombyx mori) and molten high- density polyethylene (HDPE) using shear induced polarised light imaging (SIPLI). The current understanding of shear induced fibrillation requires polymer chains to undergo the following series of steps i) long-chain molecules are stretched, ii) and form persistent point nuclei, which iii) align under flow into rows and then iv) grow to create a crystalline fibrils. For these fibrils to remain, the temperature of the sample must be lowered to below the polymers melt point. This process is analogous to the fibrilogenesis of natural silk-polymers in which proteins align (refold), nucleate (denature), and crystallize (aggregate). However, for silks, fibrils persist without the need for a drop in temperature. From a macromolecular perspective the two processes are thought to be similar due to a native protein's unique interaction with its closely bound water. Much like an individual polymer chain in a melt, a native protein and its closely bound water molecules may be considered not as a solution but as a single processable entity, a nanocomposite termed an \\"aquamelt\\". The differences between a typical polymer and an aquamelt are highlighted by an aquamelt's ability to solidify in response to stress at environmental temperatures. This occurs when the stress applied is sufficient to separate the closely bound water from the protein, splitting the nanocomposite. This results in conformational changes to the protein and an increased probability to form hydrogen bonding between protein chains and subsequent solidification. Multiscale structures, i.e., fibrils or foams are the result of a combination of directional stress fields and the self-assembly properties of the aquamelt. Potential uses Aquamelts offer several advantages over current solutions to synthetic polymer production. Firstly they are naturally sourced, with no reliance on oil for production and are recyclable and biodegradable. Secondly they can be processed at room temperatures and pressures resulting in only water as a by-product from the solidification process. Thirdly work calculations performed on silk and high- density polyethylene feedstocks revealed a tenfold difference in the amount of shear energy required in order to initiate solidification. When processing temperature is taken into account the difference in energy requirements to undergo solidification is a thousandfold less for aquamelts than synthetic polymers.

Players control a team of comic book- style heroes battling a villain. Each player controls one or more heroes, while a villain and environment deck each run themselves. A given game includes 3 to 5 heroes, 1 villain and 1 environment, which can be mixed and matched to create a number of different scenarios. The core game comes with 10 heroes, 4 villains, and 4 environments. The board game has also been made into a mobile app game: Sentinels of the Multiverse: The Video Game. Gameplay Sentinels of the Multiverse is a cooperative card game for up to five players. The game mechanics of Sentinels of the Multiverse include aspects that are somewhat similar to a variety of other card games, including Magic: The Gathering and Dominion. The game is played with three different types of decks of cards: Heroes, Villains, and Environment. * Hero decks include (usually) one card that represents the hero. It gives the hero's initial hit points and a power they may use. If the hero loses all of their hit points, the hero card is flipped over and the hero cannot play any cards or use any powers, but instead has three incapacitated abilities that can be used for the hero to continue to help their allies. Hero decks also contain forty other cards representing ongoing abilities, equipment, and one-shots that can be played. The heros lose the game when all of them are incapacitated. * Villain decks also include (usually) one card representing the villain. This card includes their starting hit points, rules for setting up the villain at the start of the game, abilities they take each turn, and a mechanism by which the card may be flipped over. The flipped version of the villain card represents another phase of the fight. Each villain has different flip mechanics. Villain decks also contain twenty-five other cards with one-shots, ongoings, minions, devices, and other types of cards that might be put into play. Villains are generally defeated when reduced to zero or fewer hit points, but may also have other win and/or lose conditions. * Environment decks represent the environment in which the heroes battle the villain. The environment deck can affect both heroes and villains. Cards in this deck include persistent effects that remain in play until certain conditions are met, one-shots, and neutral targets. Many environment cards can be dismissed if the heroes agree to discard cards or skip turns. Heroes, Villains, and other targets can all be damaged by damage dealt from any source. Damage has a type, such as melee, projectile, fire, or toxic damage, and certain cards can be used to protect against specific types of damage. The game is played with three to five heroes, one villain, and one environment. Each villain also has an \\"advanced\\" rule that makes them more difficult to fight for an added challenge. Some villain effects are scaled based on 'H', the number of heroes in the game. Heroes start the game by drawing four cards from their deck into their hand. There is no limit to the number of cards that can be kept in hand. Cards in hand can either be shown or kept hidden. The Villain turn is first, followed by each hero in turn, followed by the environment turn, constituting one round of play. Play continues in turn until the heroes have won or lost. On the villain's turn, any Start of Turn effects are resolved, then a Villain card is played, then any End of Turn effects are resolved. The villain's cards will have specific instructions on where to target damage, such as the hero with the highest hit points. In cases of ties, the players decide as a group where to direct such damage. On a hero's turn, Start of Turn effects are resolved, then one card may be played, then one power may be used, then one card may be drawn, then End of Turn effects are resolved. If a hero has lost all hit points, then instead Start of Turn effects are resolved, one incapacitated ability may be used, then End of Turn effects are resolved. Hero and Villain character cards (and in rare cases environment cards) have a nemesis symbol. If a card is dealing damage to another card that has the same nemesis symbol, that damage is increased by one. On the environment's turn, Start of Turn effects are resolved, one card is played, and the End of Turn effects are resolved. The core game provides ten hero, four villain and four environment decks. Expansions provide further heroes, villains, and environments, often themed to a setting or concept. These decks can all be played in a mix-and- match style. Two of the expansions, Vengeance and Villains of the Multiverse, provide team villains rather than standard villains. Team villains are used in groups of three to five, matching the number of heroes in the game, and can not be interchanged with standard villains. Concept and development Sentinels was conceived by Christopher Badell. He had been playing various comic-book related games, but found that most of them were based on having just two characters directly engaging each other, and wanted instead one \\"about people with different abilities and different outlooks getting together to beat an overwhelming threat in a weird environment\\". This led to the basis of Sentinels. Badell teamed up with artist Adam Rebottaro to craft the first set. Badell worked on creating a fictional comic-book universe inspired by the long histories developed by both DC and Marvel Comics. Badell crafted a timeline of stories that would be published in the fictional \\"Sentinel Comics\\" imprint label, enabling him to develop characters and write the flavor text for each card. The initial set featured five heroes inspired by the Avengers, and with characters representing amalgams of established superheroes, such as Legacy blending aspects of both Superman and Captain America. Expansions generally include characters inspired by side plots from the main storyline. Badell also considered the history of comic book publishing when developing characters. One character, Chrono Ranger, a sheriff with time-manipulation powers, was conceived as the result of Sentinel Comics starting out as a cowboy-story publisher and grandfathering this character from their earlier works into superhero settings, akin to Groot's publication history. This also led to variations on heroes reflecting comics' frequent shifting of alliances, with most of the same powers but subtly different effects. Badell had anticipated that Sentinels would be a limited series based on his narrative approach; he wrote flavor text pointing to an ultimate event to be revealed with the final expansion, \\"Sentinels of the Multiverse: Oblivaeon\\". Badell will still continue to support projects based on Sentinels, including a miniature tabletop adaption of the game in Sentinel Tactics, and looks to actually develop comic books based on the Sentinel Comics label. Reception Sentinels of the Multiverse has been well received by players and critics since its launch, with Tom Vasel of The Dice Tower podcast giving it the #1 slot in his \\"top 30 games to look out for from Gen Con 2011\\", and the review blog Giant Fire Breathing Robot awarding it \\"Board Game of the Year: 2011\\".http://gfbrobot.com/2011/12/01/variant-and-the-board-game-of-the-year- goes-to/ Reviewers generally praised the art and gameplay, while criticizing the small box, lack of HP trackers, and difficulty scaling among different numbers of players. Expansions Greater Than Games released an expansion, Sentinels of the Multiverse: Rook City in the spring of 2012. The expansion added 2 heroes, 4 villains and 2 environments to the base game. The villains in Rook City also include an H icon in some cards, which represents the number of heroes in the game, as a way to improve difficulty scaling. The cards used in Rook City are also of a better and thicker cardstock as compared to the original base game. In the autumn of 2012 Greater Than Games released their second expansion, Sentinels of the Multiverse: Infernal Relics. Similar to Rook City, this expansion added an additional 2 heroes, 4 villains and 2 environments to the game. This expansion also introduced the concept of a super villain group, containing multiple villain characters in a single deck. As of fall 2013, the Rook City and Infernal Relics expansions are now produced in a combined box. At the same time as Infernal Relics, Greater Than Games also released a new edition of the base game, Sentinels of the Multiverse: Enhanced Edition. This edition of the game has minor changes to some of the cards and added the H icon to the base game's villains to improve their scalability. A better box with built-in storage inserts was also introduced with this edition, along with dividers for all of the decks available to date. Other improvements include better card stock for all cards and new artwork for the environment cards, in line with what was introduced with Rook City and Infernal Relics. 162 tokens were also included in the new edition to help keep track of damage and the various different types of modifiers. In spring of 2013, Greater Than Games released the third Expansion, Sentinels of the Multiverse: Shattered Timelines. Similar to Rook City and Infernal Relics, this expansion added 2 heroes, 4 villains, and 2 environments to the game. The Shattered Timelines expansion featured the winning fan-created villain from the Create a Villain Contest run by Greater Than Games in September 2012. The expansion was supported by a Kickstarter campaign that ended successfully on November 29, 2012, having raised $185,200. During the Shattered Timelines Kickstarter Campaign, Greater Than Games announced that they would use some of the funds raised during that campaign to help finance their fourth expansion Sentinels of the Multiverse: Vengeance. This expansion added 5 heroes, 5 villains, and 2 environments. The new villains have smaller decks than previous villains, as they're designed to be played in a new game mode as a party against the heroes. Vengeance is available as of February 2014. During this time Greater Than Games also released the box set Rook City & Infernal Relics, discontinuing the production of separate boxes for Rook City and Infernal Relics. The Vengeance box included an advertisement for an upcoming expansion, Wrath of the Cosmos, later released in January 2015. This expansion included 2 heroes, 4 villains and 2 environments. The preorder campaign was largely successful and added 1 more hero, 1 villain, and 1 environment along with 6 hero promos. The Villains of the Multiverse Expansion, released in December 2015, reintroduces some old villains as well as some new ones, using the Vengeance combat mechanic of having one villain per hero character. This expansion includes ten new villain decks with over-sized villain character cards and four new environment decks. The preorder campaign also allowed the release of 1 promo villain and 1 promo environment, as well as 7 promo hero character cards. On October 16, 2014, an iOS/Android version was released followed on December 22, 2014 with a Steam release for the PC. On January 29, 2016, Greater Than Games announced the title of the next expansion, \\"OblivAeon\\", which would be on Kickstarter beginning February 9, 2016 and will feature numerous perks. In this announcement, they also stated that this will be the final expansion for Sentinels of the Multiverse. That Kickstarter ended on March 11, 2016 with 9,982 backers raising $1,518,321. Sentinel Tactics In March 2014, Greater Than Games announced a Kickstarter for a new game set in the Sentinels of the Multiverse universe, Sentinel Tactics: The Flame Of Freedom. This reached its funding goal in under 6 hours. Video game adaption Handelabra Games adapted the board game into a 2014 video game that was released on iOS and Android devices on October 15, 2014, and for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux computers on December 22. 2014. The game features both single and multiplayer options as with the board game, and otherwise follows the same rules as the board game, and allowing for the same variation in challenge based on which heroes, villains, and environments were used. The game shipped with a base set of ten heroes, four villains, and four environments, and included additional downloadable content that aligned with the board game's expansions. Critical reception for Sentinels of the Multiverse has been mostly positive and the game holds a rating of 78/100 on Metacritic, based on 5 reviews. Conor Lorenz of Gizorama gave particular attention to the auto-save function which saves the current battle if the iPad closes down for whatever reason. Andrew Fretz of TouchArcade says that \\"The app is solidly constructed\\" but \\"I don't think there is much meaningful strategy in the game.\\" Brad Cummings of BoardGameGeek gave the app 4/5 stars, concluding \\"The gameplay that has made this game a cult hit shines bright in this digital version...This is a must have addition to your digital board game collection.\\" He noted that \\"a lack of information in some parts of the game\\" may make it hard for new players to keep track of everything happening.

Women in telegraphy have been evident since the 1840s. The introduction of practical systems of telegraphy in the 1840s led to the creation of a new occupational category, the telegrapher, telegraphist or telegraph operator. Duties of the telegrapher included sending and receiving telegraphic messages, known as telegrams, using a variety of signaling systems, and routing of trains for the railroads. While telegraphy is often viewed as a males-only occupation, women were also employed as telegraph operators from its earliest days. Telegraphy was one of the first communications technology occupations open to women. United States Demonstration of a successful system for sending telegraphic messages by Samuel F. B. Morse in 1844 quickly led to the development of a telegraphic network in the eastern United States, constructed and maintained by a number of private companies.Thompson, Robert L., Wiring A Continent: The History of the Telegraph Industry in the United States, 1832-1866 (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1947). Operation of this network required skilled operators at each station, capable of sending and receiving messages in Morse code. The shortage of qualified operators led to the hiring of women as well as men to fill a rapidly growing need for operators in the late 1840s as the telegraph spread across the country. Sarah Bagley (1806 - ?), a women's rights advocate and founder of the Lowell Female Labor Reform Association, became the telegraph operator for Francis Ormand Jonathan Smith's New York and Boston Magnetic Telegraph Company in Lowell, Massachusetts, in 1846. She probably became aware of the telegraph and its potential from her previous work as an editor for the reform newspaper, the Voice of Industry. Phoebe Wood (1816-1891), sister of Morse's associate Ezra Cornell and wife of telegraph entrepreneur Martin B. Wood, became the telegrapher in Albion, Michigan, in 1849, after Cornell's business partner John James Speed pointed out the need for operators in sparsely populated frontier areas. Jepsen, My Sisters Telegraphic, pp. 4-5. Initially used to transmit personal messages, business transactions and news reports, the telegraph began to be used for train routing by the railroads as well in the 1850s. Elizabeth Cogley (1833-1922) of Lewistown, Pennsylvania, became one of the earliest women to work as a railroad telegrapher when she was hired by the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1855.Jepsen, My Sisters Telegraphic, p. 6.A Typical Depot Telegraph Station, 1870s. Source: \\"The Telegraph,\\" Harper's Magazine, August 1873, 332. The employment of women in the telegraph industry in the United States increased during the American Civil War (1861-1865) as male telegraphers were drafted or joined the U.S. Military Telegraph Corps of the Union army. A few women served in the Military Telegraph Corps. Louisa Volker (1838-1905), the telegraph operator at Mineral Point, Missouri, provided important information on troop movements in her role as Military Telegrapher. After the war, as men returned from the military and competition for jobs arose, male operators began to question the suitability of placing women operators in the telegraph office, and the issue was hotly debated in the telegraph journals. However, when Western Union, the largest telegraph company, opened a telegraph school for women at Cooper Union in 1869 and began to employ large numbers of women, often at lower wages than their male counterparts, the continued presence of women in the industry was assured.Melodie Andrews,: \\"'What the Girls Can Do': The Debate over the Employment of Women in the Early American Telegraph Industry\\", Essays in Economic and Business History 8 (1990), pp. 109-120. According to the U.S. Census, the percentage of telegraphers who were women in the U.S. grew from four percent in 1870 (355 out of 8316 total) to twenty percent in 1920 (16,860 out of 79,434 total).Jepsen, My Sisters Telegraphic, pp. 52-3.  Mexico and Canada Telegraph service in Canada was provided both by private companies and the Government Telegraph Service (GTS). In Toronto in 1902, 42 percent of the operators at the Great Northwestern Telegraph Company were women. At the offices of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the same city, 28 percent of the operators were female in 1902. The percentage of the workforce that was female was somewhat lower in western Canada. In 1917, 18 percent of the operators in Winnipeg were women.Shirley Tillotson \\"'We may all soon be first-class men': Gender and Skill in Canada's Early Twentieth Century Urban Telegraph Industry,\\" Labour/Le Travail 27 (spring 1991), pp. 98-9. During the First World War, employment on \\"the Home Front\\" included women telegraphers; for example, Beamsville, Ontario, which was also the location of an dogfighting (aerial combat) school http://www.warmuseum.ca/education/online-educational- resources/dispatches/into-the-blue-pilot-training-in-canada-1917-18/ . Many telegraphers from the United States came to Mexico to work for the railroads during the administration of Porfirio Diaz (1876-1911), including several American women. Abbie Struble Vaughan (1845-1924) worked for the Mexican National Railroad and the Mexican Central Railroad from 1891 to 1911; \\"Ma Kiley\\" (Mattie Collins Brite) (1880-1971) worked as a railroad operator in Mexico from 1902 to 1905.Jepsen, My Sisters Telegraphic, p. 10. England and Europe The Central Telegraph Office, London, 1874. Source: Illustrated London News, December 12, 1874. Women began to work for a number of private telegraph companies in England in the 1850s, including the Electric Telegraph Company. The Telegraph School for Women was established in London in 1860. The Queen's Institute for the Training and Employment of Educated Women began classes in telegraphy in Dublin in 1862; its graduates were employed by the British and Irish Magnetic Telegraph Company. Telegraphers in England used the Wheatstone-Cooke system of telegraphy as well as Morse code for transmission of messages. The number of women employed as telegraphists increased after the telegraph service was taken over by the British Post Office in 1870; in that year, 1535 out of 4913, or 31 percent of all operators, were women.Kieve, Jeffrey. The Electric Telegraph: A Social and Economic History. Newton Abbot, Devon: David & Charles, 1973, pp. 39, 85. In most of Europe, the telegraph service came under the control of the government posts and telegraph administration. The telegraph administrations of Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries first began to employ women as telegraph operators in the 1850s; France, Germany, and Russia first admitted women to the telegraph service in the 1860s.Garland, Charles. \\"Women as Telegraphists.\\" Economic Journal, June 1901, pp. 252, 255. A French telegrapher, Juliette Dodu (1848-1909), became a heroine of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 when she reputedly tapped the telegraph lines being used by the Prussian military and passed the information to French military forces. By 1880, 230 of the 624 telegraphers at the Paris Central Telegraphique, or 37 percent, were women.Bouvier, Jeanne. Histoire des Dames Employees dans les Postes, Telegraphes et Telephones de 1714 a 1929. Paris: Les Presses Universitaires de France, 1930, pp. 128, 131, 329-330. Asia, Africa, Australia and South America The construction of the world-wide telegraph network in the late nineteenth century was closely tied to colonialism as the European powers used the telegraph to govern and communicate with their overseas possessions. By the 1870s, a network of land lines and submarine communications cables had telegraphically connected all the inhabited continents. =Asia= By 1900, women were employed as telegraph operators in Ceylon (Sri Lanka), the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia), French Indochina (Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos), as well as in Japan. In 1907, women also began to be employed as telegraphists in India and Burma (Myanmar).Garland, \\"Women as Telegraphists,\\" p. 252. =Africa= Women were employed as telegraph operators in the British Cape Colonies (South Africa), the Portuguese colonies (Angola, Mozambique) and French West Africa (Senegal, Mauritania, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Dahomey) by 1900. =Australia= 1872 Engraving by Samuel Calvert. Australia became part of the world telegraph network in 1872 when a submarine cable was completed connecting Darwin, Australia with England via Java in the Dutch East Indies. An Overland Telegraph line was constructed to connect Darwin with other major cities in Australia. In 1874 the Ballarat School of Mines (now Federation University) began to admit women students to its telegraphy course. The Industrial and Technological Museum in Melbourne ran a telegraphy course in 1870=1880 that became so popular with women that a separate class for men was introduced. =South America= Around 1870, a school was established at the National Institute in Chile to teach telegraphy to women. This led to the employment of women as telegraphers in many locations in Chile. By 1900, women were also employed as telegraph operators in Argentina. Labor movement A telegraph operator in the 1940s. Telegraphers in the U.S. began to form unions in the late nineteenth century as discontent grew over low wages and poor working conditions. Women telegraphers joined the Telegraphers' Protective League and participated in the unsuccessful strike against Western Union in 1870.Jepsen, My Sisters Telegraphic, pp. 148-155. The Brotherhood of Telegraphers was organized in 1881 as an affiliate union of the Knights of Labor; their platform included a demand for equal pay for equal work, regardless of gender. When the Brotherhood of Telegraphers called a general strike against the telegraph companies in 1883, many women operators joined and actively participated in the labor action, including Minnie Swan (1863 - ?), a New York telegrapher who emerged as the leader of the women strikers. However, the strike again failed as the telegraph companies simply called in non-union strikebreakers to replace the striking operators.Gabler, The American Telegrapher, pp. 106-44. Women operators also joined the Order of Railroad Telegraphers, founded in 1886, and the Commercial Telegraphers Union of America, organized in 1903; women held leadership positions at various times in both unions. Mary Macaulay (1865-1944), a press operator who worked for many newspapers and wire services in New York, was elected International Vice President of the Commercial Telegraphers Union of America in 1919, the first woman to hold an elective office at the national level in a union. Louisa Margaret Dunkley (1866-1927) was an Australian telegraphist who founded the Victorian Women's Post and Telegraph Association in Australia in the 1890s to advocate for equal pay and working conditions for women operators. Women's rights movement Many women telegraph operators were strong supporters of women's rights, including suffrage and equal pay for equal work. Sarah Bagley became a telegraph operator in 1846 after forming the Lowell Female Labor Reform Association to support better working conditions for the women who worked in the textile mills of Lowell, Massachusetts. Mathilde Fibiger (1830-1872) was a Danish feminist, novelist, and telegraphist who championed women's rights in her novels. Mary Macaulay, a strong supporter of women's suffrage in the U.S., served as secretary to Susan B. Anthony while working as a telegrapher in Rochester, New York. Leah Rosenfeld was a railroad telegraph operator and station agent whose 1968 lawsuit against the Southern Pacific Railroad and the state of California helped to end job and wage discrimination against women and ensure equal opportunities for women in the U.S. railroad industry. Depiction in fiction The increasing numbers of women in the telegraph industry in the late nineteenth century and growing public interest in their role led to the development of a literary genre known as the \\"telegraphic romance.\\" These novels and short stories tell the story of a young woman who finds romance in her work as a telegrapher, often with another operator whom she meets \\"over the wire.\\" One of the most popular of the telegraphic romances was the novel Wired Love, written by former telegraph operator Ella Cheever Thayer and published in 1879. It is the story of telegrapher Nattie Rogers and her romance with the mysterious \\"C\\", whom she befriends over the wire. In the Cage, an 1898 novella by Henry James, has as its central character a nameless London telegraphist; James uses her interactions with her customers in the Mayfair district to weave a plot around issues of class and society in late Victorian England. The female telegraph operator, fending off desperados while tending to her duties at lonely railroad stations, became a stock character in many of the melodramas produced in the early years of the cinema. The Lonedale Operator (1911), starring Blanche Sweet, and The Girl and Her Trust (1912), starring Dorothy Bernard, were filmed by the director D. W. Griffith for Biograph Studios. The Hazards of Helen serials, filmed between 1914 and 1917 by the Kalem Company, featured first Helen Holmes and later Helen Gibson as adventurous telegraph operators who performed daring stunts on a weekly basis to save the day for the railroad company. Decline of industry The introduction of the Teletype or Telex and the automatic printer, beginning around 1915, and the development of the Telex network in the 1920s, greatly increased the speed and efficiency of message transmission, as well as changing the work of the telegraph operator. Instead of using a telegraph key to transmit messages in Morse code, the Teletype operator simply typed messages on a standard typewriter keyboard. At the receiving end, an automatic printer printed out the text on paper sheets or tape. Introduction of the Teletype greatly increased the number of women employed as telegraphers; however, the predominantly female Teletype operators were generally paid less than the mainly male Morse operators.Jepsen, My Sisters Telegraphic, pp. 64-5. The number of messages sent by telegraph began to decline in the mid-twentieth century, due to competition with the telephone and the internet. Although still used by radio amateurs and hobbyists, the last use of Morse code for signalling came to an end on January 31, 1999, when it was no longer required for international distress signalling by ships at sea. Western Union discontinued its telegraph service in 2006.

It is a network of over 200 organizations based in the US and Canada working for \\"a future where people, communities, and ecosystems thrive...where capital (wealth and the means of creating it) is a tool of the people, not the other way around.\\" as part of what it describes as the New Economy movement.  History  =New Economics Institute= Shortly after the start of the financial crisis in 2008, leaders from both New Economics Foundation (NEF) and the E. F. Schumacher Society recognized the need for an organization that could help bring systemic economic alternatives into the mainstream in North America. They collaborated to create a new organization called the New Economics Institute. =New Economics Network= The New Economics Network was created by Sarah Stranahan in 2009 as a loose network of about two hundred organizations working for the new economy. In a lecture for the National Council for Science and the Environment Gus Speth said the organisation wanted to create a sustainable and caring economy. =Rename and merger= In March 2012, Bob Massie became the president of the New Economics Institute. In 2013, the New Economics Institute merged with the New Economy Network and became the New Economy Coalition. Also in that year, Dave Pruett writing for the Huffington Post described the organization as one of two \\"leading the way toward economic viability\\". Massie stepped down from being the coalition's president in October 2014. Farhad Ebrahimi served as intern director until May 2015 when Jonathan Rosenthal, a co-founder of the worker cooperative Equal Exchange was hired by a board and staff committee. Policy = New Economy movement = The New Economy movement is often referred to as just 'new economy'. It considers that the current economic system needs to be restructured. The theory is based on the assumption that people and the planet should come first, and that it is human well-being, not economic growth, which should be prioritized. It draws on an aggregate of alternative economic thought that challenges the fundamental assumptions of mainstream neoclassical and Keynesian economics. Some of the approaches it includes are: ecological economics, solidarity economy, commons, degrowth, regenerative design, systems thinking and Buddhist economics. Gar Alperovitz described the New Economy movement as ‚Äú... a far-ranging coming together of organizations, projects, activists, theorists and ordinary citizens committed to rebuilding the American political-economic system from the ground up.\\" In 2009, Sarah van Gelder wrote, ‚ÄúThe new economy is about increasing quality of life, improving health, and restoring the environment.\\" The movement is entirely distinct from the definition of a service-based new economy as popularized during the late 1990s by Stephen B. Shepard, among others. =Focus= The NEC focuses on issues in the United States and Canada and organizes there, although it does work in partnership with similar networks around the world. Writing for The Guardian Jo Confino noted the NEC's approach of getting organizations to work together that share common aims if not strategies.  Work  = New economy movement advocacy = The New Economy Coalition works to connect and promote its member organizations and the broader New Economy movement through online infrastructure, leadership development, strategic communications, granting programs, national conferences, and more. = Conferences =  Strategies for a New Economy Conference  The New Economy Coalition hosted a conference entitled \\"Strategies for a New Economy\\" as a convening summit for diverse economic reformation efforts. The conference was held from June 8‚Äì10, 2012 at Bard College in New York. The conference featured workshops, strategizing sessions and lectures. More than 500 people were in attendance, representing over 300 organizations. CommonBound 2014 In June 2014 the CommonBound conference brought together movement leaders, activists and practitioners.

Harris Brian F. Harris is a former university professor at the University of Southern California (USC) and the originator of the study of category management. Career Originally from Australia, Brian Harris earned a BA in Economics from the University of Queensland and an MBA from Lehigh University. Afterwards he received a PhD in Marketing from Michigan State University. Harris eventually became the Director of the Food Industry Management Program and a marketing professor in the Graduate School of Business Administration at the University of Southern California, where he co- founded the Quaker Oats Buying Skills Seminar. While Harris was a professor he developed a software program called Apollo Space Management System that could calculate the optimal level of space for products on a store shelf per category of product. The first in store testing and use of the program resulted in that store becoming the dominant shop in the region. The product was developed in conjunction with an organization called ABA Groups, which Harris founded. In the late 1980s Harris originated the concept of category management. The concept has evolved over time; however, the most commonly used category management model today was developed into an eight step procedure by Harris in 1997 and is called the Brian Harris Model. The basis of category management, according to Harris models, is to: force consumer focus during retail decisions; create strategy for differentiation and competition; provide a model for collaboration; promote information sharing for the sake of better decision-making; provide strategic logic when developing tactical decisions; clarify decisions when it comes to asset allocation; and clarify employee responsibilities. In 1990 Harris founded a category management consultation services firm in Cincinnati called the Partnering Group. Over time, category management began to be delegated to specific suppliers instead of being used in-house, which was outside the spirit of Harris's original idea and a practice that Harris criticized. The Partnering Group became known for establishing best practice policies for collaborations between retailers and suppliers. These best practice guides have been adopted by the ECR Consortia in the US, Europe, and Brazil. Harris still serves as founder and chairman of the Partnering Group. Since its founding the Partnering Group has worked with retail clients in over 25 countries.

Guggenheim Museum in New York City and the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice, Italy, for 27 years, a longer tenure than any of the city's major arts institutions' directors. Born and raised in Czechoslovakia, Messer became a U.S. citizen in 1944 and served in the U.S. Army in World War II. He earned a master's degree in art history and museology from Harvard University. From 1947 to 1961, he worked in a series of art and museum administration positions, the last of which was director of the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston. In 1961, he became director of the Guggenheim Museum in New York. There, he was able to establish the usefulness of the spiral-shaped Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Guggenheim as a venue for the display of art, despite the doubts of critics and artists. Messer was instrumental in expanding the museum's collection during his tenure, especially by persuading Peggy Guggenheim to donate her collection to the Guggenheim Foundation. He retired in 1988 to take up freelance curating, teaching, writing, lecturing. Early life Messer was born in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia and grew up in Prague. His mother came from a family of musicians, and his father was an art historian and a professor of German.Weber, Bruce. \\"Thomas M. Messer, Museum Director Who Gave Guggenheim Cachet, Dies at 93\\", The New York Times, May 15, 2013 He studied chemistry in Prague until September 2, 1939, when he sailed for England, but the following day England declared war with Germany, and the ship on which he was travelling, the Athenia, was torpedoed and sunk. Messer was rescued and soon travelled to the United States, where he enrolled as an exchange student at Thiel College, Greenville, Pennsylvania. He switched to the study of modern languages at Boston University, Massachusetts, from which he graduated in 1942. After working as a multilingual monitor and interrogator for military intelligence at the Office of War Information in New York, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and became a U.S. citizen in 1944, seeing combat overseas in 1944‚Äì1945.Thomas Messer curriculum vitae, Special Tribute Norris Embry, The Norris Embry Estate and Norris Embry Artworks Collection Ltd (2012), accessed April 11, 2012 After the war, Messer worked at the Office of Military Government, United States in Munich, Germany, studying art for the first time at the Sorbonne in Paris. Receiving his degree in 1947, he returned to the U.S., where he married Remedio Garcia Villa (d. 2002). From 1949 to 1952, he served as the director of the Roswell Museum and Art Center, except for a year's leave of absence, when he studied for a master's degree in art history and museology at Harvard University. He then was assistant director and later director at the American Federation of Arts until 1956. From 1957 to 1961, he was director of the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston and, for part of that time, taught modern art at Harvard. Guggenheim and later years Messer took over at the Guggenheim Museum in 1961, at a time when the museum's ability to present art at all was in doubt due to the challenges of working in the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed building's unique continuous spiral ramp gallery that is tilted, with curved walls. Almost immediately, in 1962, he took a risk putting on a large exhibition that combined the Guggenheim's paintings with sculptures on loan from the Hirshhorn Museum. Three-dimensional sculpture, in particular, entailed, \\"the problem of installing such a show in a museum bearing so close a resemblance to the circular geography of hell,\\" where any vertical object appears tilted in a \\"drunken lurch\\" because the slope of the floor and the curvature of the walls could combine to produce vexing optical illusions. The Guggenheim's gallery ‚Äì part of the spiral ramp It turned out that the combination could work well in the Guggenheim's space, but, Messer recalled that at the time, \\"I was scared. I half felt that this would be my last exhibition.\\" Messer had the foresight to prepare by staging a smaller sculpture exhibition the previous year, in which he discovered how to compensate for the space's weird geometry by constructing special plinths at a particular angle, so the pieces were not at a true vertical yet appeared to be so. In the earlier sculpture show, this trick proved impossible for one piece, an Alexander Calder mobile whose wire inevitably hung at a true plumb vertical, \\"suggesting hallucination\\" in the disorienting context of the tilted floor. In 1963, Messer acquired for the museum an important private modern art collection from art dealer Justin K. Thannhauser.Decker, Andrew. \\"Oral History Interview with Thomas M.

In 1986, the Foundation purchased the Palladian-style pavilion building. Messer served as director of the Guggenheim Foundation from 1981 to 1988. He announced his retirement from the Guggenheim in November 1987, and a search committee found his replacement, Thomas Krens, by 1988. Messer's retirement announcement coincided with the 50th birthday celebration of the Guggenheim Museum. At the exhibition put on in celebration, \\"virtually every foreign artist who has ever shown at the Guggenheim flew in to pay tribute\\" to Messer. From 1990, he was a freelance curator, teacher, writer and arts consultant. Messer died at his home in New York City on May 15, 2013 at the age of 93.

He edited the first catalogue raisonn√© of Paul C√©zanne. Life Lionello Venturi was born in 1885, son of art historian Adolfo Venturi. He became a specialist in the art of the Italian Renaissance, but was also interested in late 19th and early 20th century art. In 1918 he met the financier and collector Riccardo Gualino, and advised him to buy work by Amedeo Modigliani. Gualino and Venturi supported Turin painters such as Felice Casorati and the Gruppo di Sei (Group of Six), which included Carlo Levi, Francesco Menzio, Jessie Boswell, Gigi Chessa, Enrico Paolucci and Nicola Galante. Venturi was appointed Professor of Art History at the University of Turin in 1919. One of his first students there was Mary Pittaluga, who wrote her thesis on Fromentin under Venturi.Venturi, Lionello , Dictionary of Art Historians, accessed 11 April 2012 In 1930 Venturi organized a retrospective exhibition of Modigliani's work in Venice based on the paintings owned by Gualino. Though appointed his father's successor in the art history chair at the University of Rome in 1931, Venturi refused to swear allegiance to Benito Mussolini's regime in August 1931 and so was forced to resign from the university. He left Italy, initially moving to Paris, where he wrote, advised art dealers and museum curators, and produced the first catalogue raisonn√© of Paul C√©zanne. After the establishment of the Vichy regime, he emigrated to the United States, living in New York City until 1945 and lecturing at a range of American universities.Romy Golan, 'The Critical Moment: Lionello Venturi in America', in Christopher E.

After the war he returned to Italy, taking up his chair in art history at Rome. Lionello Venturi was influenced by the idealism of Benedetto Croce as well as the writing of Alois Riegl and Heinrich W√∂lfflin. His son was the historian Franco Venturi.

Launched in June 1950, the station employed many West Texas musical figures before they were famous, including future Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee Roy Orbison. The station's broadcast license was last held by La Radio Cristiana Network, Inc. Owner Paulino Bernal surrendered the license for KERB and five other stations to the Federal Communications Commission on Nov. 7, 2013. Programming KERB, like most rural American radio stations in the 1950s, had launched with an eclectic mix of music styles but became a solid country & western outlet through the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. Most recently, KERB broadcast a Spanish-language religious radio format to the greater Odessa, Texas, area. The station shared some programming with former sister stations KAYG, KDFM, KIBL, KLDS, and KERB-FM as part of the La Radio Cristiana Network. History =Early days= In 1949, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued a construction permit to the Kermit Broadcasting Company for a new AM radio station to broadcast with 1,000 watts of power, daytime only, on a frequency of 600 kilohertz. The station was assigned the call sign \\"KERB\\" by the FCC. The station signed on in June 1950 with George H. Cook as company president, Victor King as general manager, James Boultinghouse as program director, and James Radcliffe as chief engineer. A new company called Radio Station KERB, Inc., purchased the radio station on November 23, 1955. H.V. Brinson served as both company president and the station's general manager until he sold the station. KERB Broadcasting, Inc., acquired the radio station on October 1, 1968. Floyd Shelton was company president and Ken Welch was general manager under the new ownership. In the 1970s, Jean Welch became the station's office manager and program director while Doug Welch served as chief engineer. In 1979, the Welch family purchased KERB Broadcasting, Inc., and Ken Welch added company president to his duties. =1980s and 1990s= To expand to 24-hour operation, KERB was joined in 1987 by a new FM sister station, licensed as \\"KERB-FM\\", not bound by the AM stations \\"daytimer\\" restriction. (A \\"daytimer\\" is licensed to operate only from local sunrise to local sunset to protect other radio stations from skywave interference.) In March 1988, owners M.F. and Jean Welch agreed to transfer control of KERB Broadcasting, Inc., to Marlin D. Kuykendall. The FCC approved the transfer on April 12, 1988, and the move was consummated on May 1, 1988. Less than two years later, the station faced financial difficulties and in January 1991 the KERB and KERB-FM broadcast licenses were involuntarily transferred from KERB Broadcasting, Inc., to Ron White acting as receiver. The FCC approved the move on February 15, 1991. In June 1991, the station applied for special temporary authority to remain dark while a new operator for KERB could be found. The FCC granted this authority on November 4, 1991, with a scheduled expiration date of March 4, 1992. In September 1991, receiver Ron White found a buyer for both stations and applied to transfer the broadcast licenses on Mesa Entertainment, Inc. The FCC approved the deal on November 4, 1991, and after extended complications the transaction was consummated on March 15, 1996. In March 1997, Mesa Entertainment, Inc., made a deal to sell KERB and KERB-FM to La Radio Cristiana Network, Inc. The FCC approved the sale on May 20, 1997, and formal consummation of the transaction occurred on September 15, 1997. Station alumni *Rockabilly pioneer Charline Arthur worked as a singer and a disc jockey at KERB from 1950 until 1953 when she was \\"discovered\\" by Colonel Tom Parker. Parker signed her to a recording contract with RCA Records. She would later star on the Big D Jamboree, perform throughout the 1950s and 1960s, and be inducted into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. *American singer-songwriter Roy Orbison began performing on KERB in 1951. He formed a band, The Wink Westerners, with several friends from high school. In 1953, the band began their own weekly radio show on KERB. Orbison would later be signed to Sun Records, become a music legend whose career spanned four decades, and be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987.

In a career which lasted from August 1980 until October 1982 he ran fourteen times and won ten races. He is most notable for his performances in 1982 when he \\"lit up the summer\\" with a series of victories including the Eclipse Stakes and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. Background Kalaglow was a grey horse, standing just over 16 hands high, sired by Kalamoun (winner of the Poule d'Essai des Poulains and the Prix Jacques Le Marois) out of the mare Rossitor. During his racing career he was dark in colour, but like all grey horses, he lightened as he aged. As a yearling he was sent to the Newmarket October sales where he was bought for 11,500 guineas by the bloodstock agent James Delahooke on behalf of the trainer Guy Harwood. The colt subsequently entered into the ownership of Tony Ward and was trained by Harwood at Pulborough, West Sussex. Kalaglow was ridden in most of his important races by the veteran British jockey Greville Starkey. Kalaglow's name was the result of a mistake: he was originally registered as being by Kalamoun, out of a mare named Aglow. The true identity of Kalaglow's dam was only discovered when he was four years old, long after he had been named by combining the titles of both his \\"parents\\". Both Aglow and Rossitor were chestnut fillies bred by the Someries Stud and sent into training with Geoff Smyth. The accidental switch seemed to have occurred when they were transferred from the stud farm to the racing stable in 1972 but it was a full decade before a member of staff at the Irish National Stud noticed that \\"Aglow\\"'s white markings did not match those described on her identity documents. Racing career =1980: two-year-old season= Kalaglow was undefeated in five races as a two-year-old in 1980. He began his career in August, when he won a maiden race at Newmarket by six lengths and later that month he won a seven furlong race at Newbury beating a field which included the future St Leger winner Cut Above. In September he won a Nursery handicap at Newbury in which he conceded weight to all his opponents and then stepped up in distance to win a mile race at Goodwood. His most significant win came on his last start when he won the Group Three Horris Hill Stakes at Newbury, beating Cut Above (who was receiving five pounds) by three-quarters of a length. At the end of the season, Kalaglow was rated eleven pounds behind the European champion Storm Bird. =1981: three-year-old season= In early 1981, Kalaglow was prepared by his trainer for a run in The Derby and won on his debut in the Heath Stakes at Newmarket in April. He then ran in the Dante Stakes at York, but failed to show his best form on soft ground and finished unplaced behind Beldale Flutter. In the Derby Kalaglow was injured early on and finished unplaced behind Shergar. His injuries ruled him out of racing for the rest of the season. Harwood later described the colt's three-year-old season as \\"a bit of a farce\\". =1982: four-year-old season= As a four-year- old Kalaglow returned to win four of his six races. He won the nine furlong Earl of Sefton Stakes at Newmarket's Craven meeting in April and then ran poorly behind Bikala on soft ground in the Prix Ganay before taking the ten furlong Brigadier Gerard Stakes at Sandown Park in May. In the latter race he took the lead in the straight and pulled steadily clear to win by eight lengths from a field which included the Irish-trained filly Stanerra. In July he was moved up to Group One class for the first time in over a year for the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown. He started 11/10 favourite won easily by four lengths from Lobkowiez. Three weeks later, Kalaglow contested Britain's most prestigious all-aged race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot, for which Assert, the winner of the Prix du Jockey Club and the Irish Derby started 11/10 favourite. Kalaglow, starting at odds of 13/2 produced a strong late run to win by a neck from Assert, with Glint of Gold three lengths back in third and Bikala fourth. Plans to run Kalaglow in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp in October were abandoned when it was decided that the colt would be unsuited by the soft ground. Two weeks later he made his final appearance in the Champion Stakes at Newmarket in which he failed to reproduce his summer form, finishing unplaced behind the three-year-old filly Time Charter. At the end of the season was rated the best four-year-old in Europe by the International Classification. Stud record Kalaglow was a modest success as a sire of winners during a breeding career which was mainly spent at the Brook Stud at Newmarket. His best-known offspring was the Melbourne Cup winner Jeune, but he also sired the European Group 1 winners Timarida and Sternkoenig (Grosser Preis von Berlin) as well as Red Glow who started favourite for the 1988 Epsom Derby. Pedigree *Kalaglow was inbred 3 x 4 to the 2000 Guineas winner Palestine, meaning that this stallion appears in both the third and fourth generations of his pedigree.

The documentary was directed by Ari Luis Palos and produced by Eren Isabel McGinnis, the founders of Dos Vatos Productions. Precious Knowledge interweaves the stories of students and teachers in the Mexican-American Studies (MAS) Program, also known as \\"la Raza Studies\\", at Tucson Magnet High School. It narrates the progression of legislative backlash arguing that the program teaches \\"anti-American\\" values, proposed by the former Arizona Department of Education Superintendent of Public Instruction, Tom Horne. Proponents of the program argue that it allows students from all backgrounds to feel a connection with the history and culture of the indigenous Americas. Although the MAS Program was ultimately removed, MAS teachers and students challenged the banning at federal court. Precious Knowledge received academic praise when it was screened at colleges across the country. In 2011, the film won Audience Favorite and Special Jury Awards at the San Diego Latino Film Festival and Honorable Mention in the Best Documentary category at the Los Angeles Latino International Film Festival. In 2012, it won Premio Mesquite for Best Documentary at the Cine Festival in San Antonio, Texas.  Premiere  The film premiered on March 19, 2011 at the San Diego Latino Film Festival. Film producer Eren Isabel McGinnis grew up in this area and graduated from college at San Diego State University with a major in cultural anthropology. In addition to her personal ties with the city, McGinnis said San Diego was the perfect place to premiere the documentary due to the fact that ‚Äúit‚Äôs a real important base for Chicano culture.‚Äù  Plot  The film provides insight into the controversy surrounding the Mexican- American Studies (MAS), or Raza studies, program in Tucson, Arizona. In 1997, the Tucson Unified School District's governing board unanimously voted to create a Hispanic Studies Department in all of their schools, with the goal of lowering the Latino dropout rate. The department was renamed the Mexican American/ Raza studies program in 2002 and successfully improved the achievement rates of Latinos. Tucson Unified School District reported that the students taking ethnic studies classes showed significant improvements on standardized tests and the graduation rate among these students averaged 93%. The framework of the classes taught in the Raza studies program is based on a social justice pedagogy that centers around searching for the truth and the concept of love. The film takes a look inside the classroom of two Raza studies program teachers, Curtis Acosta who teaches literature, and Jose Gonzalez who teaches American Government. In their classes, Acosta and Gonzalez teach students about the history of their culture and then challenge them to reflect, realize and reconcile with their culture's past. In his article \\"Developing Critical Consciousness: Resistance Literature in a Chicano Literature Class,\\" Acosta, Curtis (2007). \\"Developing Critical Consciousness: Resistance Literature in a Chicano Literature Class\\"(PDF). English Journal. 97.2: 36. Acosta asserts that it is vital for students to discover their own purpose and heritage through educational programs like that of the MAS program and persuades other educational entities to adopt similar curriculums. The program also challenge students to become ‚Äúwarriors for their gente,‚Äù and to take action on issues they become aware of in the classes. Controversy arose surrounding the Raza studies program when Superintendent of schools, Tom Horne, announced that he would introduce a bill that would ban ethnic studies programs in the state of Arizona. Horne and other opponents of ethnic studies, argue that these programs promote racial divide amongst students in schools and is ‚Äúin conflict with the values of American Citizenship.‚Äù Horne's bill (SB1108) initially passed through Arizona's House Appropriations Committee but didn't make it to the floor after Governor Janet Napolitano threatened to veto it, so a new bill (SB1069) to ban ethnic studies was introduced in the next legislative session. After a series of debates from both sides at the committee hearing, SB1069 passed and became scheduled for a vote before the full legislature. SB 1069 fails to pass in front of the full legislature, but lawmakers continue to challenge the program's legality; legislators propose two new bills, SB 1070 and HB 2281, which are partly aimed against the ethnic studies program. To help decide if he would vote for HB 2281, Huppenthal accepts an invitation to Acosta's class. During class time Huppenthal engages in discourse with students and faculty about his concerns with the MAS program, at one point questioning why Benjamin Franklin is not displayed. Huppenthal thought this remark about Franklin was inappropriate. At the next Senate Education Committee voting session for the new bills, Huppenthal speaks about his experience in a MAS program class and HB 2281 is approved and sent to new Governor Jan Brewer for her signature. This leads to a student/teacher rally against HB 2281, at which the Tucson Brown Berets demonstrate their support for the MAS program. One week later, students, teachers, and community members then stage a sit-down at the state building where Horne and Dugan are holding the press conference. Four students and eleven adults are arrested for refusing to leave the state building. Despite their efforts, Governor Jan Brewer signed HB 2281 into law. As the documentary concludes, producers film the last day of school in Acosta and Gonzalez's classes. In Acosta's class, he and the become very emotional about their year. Finally, the students are filmed at their graduation ceremony. To conclude, it is revealed that Tom Horne declared MAS program classes in violation of the law, so the TUSD cancelled the program.  Production  Ari Luis Palos and Eren Isabel McGinnis began filming Precious Knowledge on October 31, 2008, after being granted permission by the Tucson Unified School District. The filmmakers were allowed complete access to the ethnic studies program in Tucson Magnet High School throughout the 2008-2009 school year. Early on, they planned to use a combination of interviews and footage from inside and outside the MAS classrooms to explore various perspectives and further their film. = Directors = Ari Luis Palos and Eren Isabel McGinnis had a long history of filming documentaries centered on minorities before embarking on this project. According to McGinnis, their films ‚Äúgive [a] voice to communities often silenced or stereotyped by mainstream media.‚ÄùSargent, Andrew. \\"Building Precious Knowledge: An Interview with Documentary Filmmaker Eren Isabel McGinnis.\\" MELUS 36.1 (2011): 195,217,243. Research Library. Web. 9 Nov. 2016. McGinnis was also particularly invested in this film because she had a son attending Tucson High School during the controversy. Furthermore, both filmmakers are of Mexican descent and have a ‚Äúdeep reverence and love of all things Mexican‚Äù McGinnis also revealed the meaning behind the film's title in an interview that appeared in the academic journal, The Society for the Study of the Multi-Ethnic Literature of the United States (MELUS). \\"Precious knowledge\\" is a reference to Mayan concepts that say to \\"self-reflect (Tezcatlipoca), seek out precious and beautiful knowledge (Quetzalcoatl), begin to act (Huitzilopochtli) and ultimately transform (Xipe Totec).\\" The documentary's focus on Quetzalcoatl‚Äîprecious knowledge‚Äîhighlights what the activists in the film are fighting for. This and other emphases on Aztec heritage throughout the film reveal the intent by the filmmakers to remind students of their own deep history and their indigenous ancestors. With this knowledge, Eren McGinnis hopes to support the same message supported by the Mexican-American Studies program that these Mexican-American students ‚Äúare not ‚Äòoutsiders‚Äô or 'invaders'‚Äù of this country.  Reception  Since its premiere on Independent Lens on May 17, 2012, the documentary is often screened at colleges across the country. The screening is also sometimes accompanied by a discussion on the film with Curtis Acosta, former teacher of the MAS program in Tucson Unified School District. * University of Pittsburgh (2018) * Texas A&M; (2017) * Ferris State University (2015) * Regis University (2014) * Western Illinois University (2012) = Awards = The film received the following awards: # Audience Favorite and Special Jury Award, San Diego Latino Film Festival (2011) # Honorable Mention in the Best Documentary Category, Los Angeles Latino International Film Festival (2011)\\"Precious Knowledge.\\" Zinn Education Project.

However, the audit‚Äôs findings showed that the program was in line with the bill passed into law, HB 2281.\\"Law School Professors Pursue Appeal of Tucson Ethnic Studies Ban.\\" Targeted News Service. Apr. 09 2013. ProQuest. Web. 29 Oct. 2016. Despite the results of the audit, the Arizona state government informed the Tucson United School District that the school district would lose $14 million of its funding if the program were to continue. As a result, the Tucson United School District cut the Mexican-American studies (MAS) program in early 2012.\\"Rejected in Tucson.\\" New York Times. 22 Jan. 2012: 12. Academic Search Premier.

One student noted, \\"We were in shock... it was very heartbreaking to see that happening in the middle of class.\\" In March 2013, Curtis Acosta, and other teachers and students of the program took the issue to federal court.\\"Arizona Teacher Assails Dismantling of Successful Ethnic Studies Program.\\" Targeted News Service. 03 Oct. 2012. ProQuest. Web. 29 Oct. 2016. They challenged the legality of HB 2281 and its application, with the hope that if it were overturned, the MAS program would be reinstated. The plaintiffs took issue with (1) the constitutionality of HB 2281; (2) the fact that there was no ‚Äúlegal justification to eliminate the Mexican-American Studies Program‚Äù, (because it was in line with the law, evidenced by the audit performed in 2011); and (3) the vague language of the law, which presented opportunity for discriminatory misinterpretation. Ultimately, the federal district court left the law mostly intact. The court nullified only the section of the statute, that restricted classes \\"designed for a particular ethnic group,\\" because it infringed upon the First Amendment. Unsatisfied with the results, the plaintiffs‚Äîat this point reduced to two students Korina Lopez and Maya Arce, as well as the director of the MAS program, Sean Arce (also Maya's father)‚Äîfiled an appeal.Palazzolo, Joe. \\"Appeals Court Revives Challenge to Arizona Ban on Ethnic Studies.\\" WSJ. Wsj.com, 7 July 2015. Web. 9 Nov. 2016. The case went to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on July 7, 2015, as Arce v. Douglas. The appellate court decided to return the case to the district court to give the plaintiffs a trial on their claims of racial discrimination.\\"From the Bench: Schools.\\" Newsletter on Intellectual Freedom (Online.) 64.5 (2015): 153-5. ProQuest. Web. 29 Oct. 2016. On August 22, 2017, Judge A. Wallace Tashima ruled that \\"both enactment and enforcement [of] [HB 2281] were motivated by racial animus.\\" He further added that HB 2281 demonstrated prejudice against Latino student, thus violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Judge Tashima also ruled that HB 2281 \\"violated students' [first] Amendment 'right to receive information and ideas.'\\" Racist blog posts and comments from Huppenthal also influenced Judge Tashima's ruling. While he was Arizona's Superintendent, Huppenthal used the pseudonyms \\"Thucydides\\" and \\"Falcon 9\\" to speak out against the MAS Program. Huppenthal also compared the Mexican American Studies program to Hitler's regime and criticized the program's use of Spanish radio stations, billboards, TV stations, and newspapers. In an interview with Ari Bloomekatz, Curtis Acosta claimed that the court's ruling validated the MAS program, restoring the integrity of himself and his colleagues who were criticized for supporting the TUSD's ethnic studies program. However, according to the Arizona Daily Star, it is unlikely that the MAS program will be reinstated. The fate of the program rests in the hands of the Tucson Unified School District Board. Since the program was eliminated, the district has been \\"developing 'culturally relevant courses' to replace ethnic studies programming.\\" According to Precious Knowledge, the program served as a model in the following places: San Francisco Unified School District, Houston Independent School District, School District of Philadelphia, Los Angeles Unified School District, New Haven Unified School District, Boston Public Schools, Sacramento City Unified School District and Pomona Unified School District.[7] The large controversy and banning of the program in Arizona inspired school districts in California and Texas to consider Mexican-American Studies programs. For example, the El Paso Independent School District and Ysleta Independent School District of El Paso, Texas, decided to include Mexican American Studies classes in their high schools. Curtis Acosta also started a consulting business in 2013 to further spread ethnic studies classes in the states of California, Oregon, Texas, and Washington by guiding the creation, process and training of such a program in these states.Bryson, Donna, and The A. Press. \\"Educators, Activists Lobby for Inclusion of Hispanic Studies in the Classroom.\\" Monterey County Herald (California), sec. A,A: 6. March 14, 2016. Web. 9 Nov. 2016. Recently, several states and cities have implemented ethnic studies programs in their schools. In May 2017, Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb mandated that high schools provide at least one ethnic studies elective per year. One month later, Governor Kate Brown required Oregon public schools to offer ethic studies for students in kindergarten through 12th grade and the Seattle School Board claimed they would include ethnic studies in school curriculum. In October 2017, school administrators in Bridgeport, Connecticut, approved a requirement for high school graduation where students must take a half-year class on African American studies, Latin American/Caribbean studies or perspectives on race.

The structure was developed by Boston Properties in an effort to help to revitalize the Mount Vernon Square neighborhood, and was completed in 2005. It is located on a roughly triangular parcel bounded by New York Avenue NW, K Street NW, and 10th Street NW, and is north of the CityCenterDC mixed-use residential, office, and retail project. The triangular area was originally home to Victorian housing but in 1977, the city used eminent domain to purchase the area southwest of Mount Vernon Square itself, and over the next few years, the homes and businesses on these blocks were razed. In the 1980s, Golub Realty and Willco Construction purchased the site and proposed an 11-floor office block. They sold it to Peterson Co., who sold it to Monument Realty in May 1999. Monument Realty had envisaged building either an office and retail complex, or a 1,000-room hotel. They finally sold it to Boston Properties for $43.2 million in October 2000. Boston Properties closed the parking lot on the site in late August 2002, and began construction of the building the following month. The architectural height of the building is , although the height of the main roof is just and the height of the top floor is . It has 11 stories, and a four-story underground parking garage. Reports of the building's interior space vary widely, with the most recently reported by the mainstream media. The facade is of polished granite and precast concrete in two colors.

Two very small parks exist on the triangular parcel of land, which are owned by the National Park Service. Acadiana, a 185-seat upscale restaurant on the ground floor which served Louisiana-and Cajun-style seafood was cited by Esquire magazine as one of the best new restaurants in the entire United States in 2006. The restaurant closed in December 2018, and as of January 2019 no replacement tenants have been announced. History of the site Originally, Victorian- style townhomes occupied the triangular area bounded by K Street NW, New York Avenue NW, and 10th Street NW on Mount Vernon Square. The neighborhood was originally a vibrant business district with sizeable Victorian homes, but the area went into a steep decline in the 1930s.Bednar, p. 132-133. During the 1968 Martin Luther King, Jr. riots, the area around the square suffered rioting, arson, and extensive vandalism.Bednar, p. 133. In 1977, the city used eminent domain to purchase the area southwest of Mount Vernon Square itself. Over the next few years, the homes and businesses on these blocks were razed. One of the last businesses to exist on the 901 New York Avenue NW lot was a Chinese restaurant named Nan King (which was one of the first restaurants in the city to serve dim sum).Burros, Marian. \\"Dim Sum Is Greater Than Its Parts.\\" Washington Post.

Construction In late October 2000, Monument Realty sold the parcel for $43.2 million to Boston Properties. Although media outlets reported that Boston Properties intended to build a hotel on the site, the company stated that it had never seriously considered the possibility. Rather, they had intended to construct an office building for occupancy by government agencies, law firms, and trade associations. The company announced that construction was scheduled to commence in mid-2001, and to be open to tenants by mid-2003. The architectural firm of Davis Carter Scott was hired to design the structure. The sale to Boston Properties closed on December 8, 2000. Meanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had requested proposals from real estate firms for construction of a new headquarters. Boston Properties submitted its building for consideration by the SEC shortly after the sale closed.

In addition to performing on game days, the Denver Broncos Cheerleaders annually commit close to 1,000 hours to various charities and events in Denver and the state of Colorado. The Cheerleaders wear long leather chaps and jackets in the fall months, skiwear for cold games and a more traditional cheerleading leather skirt and vest in the summer months. History The squad's origins came as the Bronkettes, which was a squad consisting of girls. In 1971, the all-adult squad debuted as the Bronco Belles and became the Pony Express in 1977. The group eventually disbanded in 1985. The Broncos brought the team back in 1993 after a 7-year absence and are proud of the work the team does both on the field and more importantly in the community. The Broncos Cheerleaders have 26 members who are selected during open auditions held each spring. Auditions focus primarily on dance ability; however, appearance, personal accomplishments and community involvement are also contributing factors. Known for their distinctive western uniforms, the Cheerleaders wear long leather chaps and jackets in the fall months, skiwear for cold games and a more traditional cheerleading leather skirt and vest in the summer months. The three uniform changes give the group flexibility with the rapidly changing Colorado weather. The Denver Broncos Cheerleaders host a Junior program known as the Junior Denver Broncos Cheerleaders (JDBC) which gives young women ages six to fourteen an opportunity to perform alongside the cheerleaders during pregame and halftime shows on game day. Since 2008, the Dare to Cheer program, in partnership with the Global Down Syndrome Foundation, has reached out to young women with disabilities to share the joy of Broncos football with them. The Dare to Cheer program was integrated into the JDBC program starting in 2013, giving these women additional opportunities to perform with the Denver Broncos Cheerleaders on game day. While the JDBC and Dare to Cheer programs require no tryouts and are tailored to young women of all ability levels, the Denver Broncos All Stars is a competitive dance team aimed at young girls who want to take their performance ability to the next level. In addition to training regularly with instructors who are current/alumni Denver Broncos Cheerleaders, the All Star program also focuses on charity work, teambuilding and achievement. From 2003 to 2015, members of the Denver Broncos Cheerleaders have toured military bases in Egypt, Cuba, Iraq, Afghanistan, Italy, Guam, Hawaii, Kwajalein, Japan and Australia performing their 90-minute show to boost the troops‚Äô morale and thank them for their service to the United States of America.

The group currently has eight offices in New York, including Garden City, East Hills, Babylon, Huntington, Manhattan, Flushing, Brooklyn-Downtown, and Brooklyn-Park Slope. The practice operates with twenty plastic and reconstructive surgeons who were trained at institutions including Memorial Sloan‚ÄìKettering Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic and Massachusetts General Hospital. LIPSG is composed of nine centers: Skincare and Age Management; Non- invasive and Surgical Facial Rejuvenation; Pediatric Plastic and Craniofacial Surgery; Facial Reanimation and Peripheral Nerve Repair; Microsurgery and Hand Reconstruction; Breast and Body Cosmetic Surgery; Burns and Complex Wound Management; Breast Reconstruction Cancer Surgery; and Post-Weight Loss Cosmetic and Reconstructive Surgery. Long Island Plastic Surgical Group surgeons are credited with improving the technique to restore function to facial muscles paralyzed by stroke and disease and discovering new uses and procedures for anti-aging treatments. The practice has also partnered with hospitals in projects such as the development of a nationally recognized burn center at Nassau University Medical Center (NuHealth), and the creation of the Cleft Palate and Craniofacial Center at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, New York. Within the practice, LIPSG oversees its own academic residency program in partnership with NUMC and Stony Brook Medicine. Graduates from the residency program have gone on to successful careers in both private practice and academia, and have become some of the leading innovators in the fields of plastic and reconstructive surgery. Currently, the practice has five online educational resources for patients on key areas of plastic surgery in the areas of Non-Surgical Cosmetic Enhancement, Hand and Nerve Repair, Facial Reanimation, Breast Cancer Reconstruction and Cosmetic Breast Surgery.  History  Long Island Plastic Surgical Group was established by Leonard R. Rubin and Richard H. Walden in April 1948 in Hempstead, New York. The practice grew through the 1950s, with Rubin and Walden offering a residency training program from 1954. During the 1960s, LIPSG founded the Nassau Cleft Palate Rehabilitation Center where all children born on Long Island with cleft lip and palate conditions were treated per an agreement with the State of New York. During this decade, Long Island Plastic Surgical Group surgeons also became the first to conduct studies on using pig skin in the treatment of burn victims at SUNY Downstate Medical Center. In 1967, Rubin co-founded the American Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ASAPS). In the 1970s, LIPSG opened a specialty center devoted to facial reanimation treatment, where Rubin and fellow surgeons could continue the work and research outlined in his published article The Anatomy of a Smile in 1974.Rubin, L. R. The anatomy of a smile: Its importance in the treatment of facial paralysis. Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 53: 384, 1974. By 1978, Long Island Plastic Surgical Group relocated to Mineola, New York and became the first independent center to receive New York State accreditation and certification for its operating rooms. A decade later, LIPSG relocated its main office to a larger facility in Garden City, New York. During the 1990s, Long Island Plastic Surgical Group opened a medical spa, now known as Deep Blue Med Spa, which focuses on skincare and non-surgical cosmetic enhancement. Today, Deep Blue Med Spa treatments range from facials and chemical peels to fractionated laser resurfacing, skin tightening and tattoo removal. Deep Blue Med Spa has locations in LIPSG‚Äôs Garden City, East Hills, Babylon and Manhattan offices. In the 2000s, the office expanded throughout New York and opened two new state-accredited operating rooms. In February 2008, LIPSG partnered with Nassau University Medical Center to oversee the $6.7 million renovation of a burn center with unique features such as a hyperbaric chamber for wound treatment. In 2009, LIPSG‚Äôs academic residency program became fully accredited and continues to serve as one of the nation‚Äôs only privately run, non-university based plastic surgery residency programs. In early 2010, LIPSG also launched 1-877-DR-STITCH, a 24-hour on- call service where LIPSG surgeons meet patients directly at the hospital emergency room or at a LIPSG office location to treat lacerations, complex wounds, broken noses, burns and facial trauma. Recognizing that Long Island, NY has one of the highest rates of breast cancer in the United States, LIPSG has become highly involved in breast cancer initiatives in local areas.

It is located on the campus of the University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill, NC.  Mission  The mission of the North Carolina AHEC Program is to meet the state‚Äôs health and health workforce needs by providing educational programs in partnership with academic institutions, health care agencies, and other organizations committed to improving the health of the people of North Carolina. The educational programs and information services are targeted toward: * Improving the distribution and retention of healthcare providers, with a special emphasis on primary care and prevention. * Improving the diversity and cultural competence of the health care workforce in all health disciplines. * Enhancing the quality of care and improving health care outcomes. * Addressing the health care needs of underserved communities and populations.  History  The North Carolina AHEC Program evolved from national and state concerns with the supply, distribution, retention and quality of health professionals. In 1970, a report from the Carnegie Commission recommended the development of a nationwide system of Area Health Education Centers. Legislation and federal support since the early 1970s has made the implementation of AHEC programs possible in many states. This national focus coincided with a growing effort in North Carolina to establish statewide community training for health professionals and reverse a trend toward shortages and uneven distribution of primary care physicians in the state's rural areas. The program began in 1972 with three AHEC regions under a federal AHEC contract with the UNC-CH School of Medicine. In 1974, the North Carolina General Assembly approved and funded a plan by the UNC-CH School of Medicine to create a statewide network of nine AHEC regions. The plan called for the establishment of 300 new primary care medical residencies and the regular rotation of students to off-campus sites. The General Assembly also provided funds to build or renovate AHEC educational facilities in the nine regions and to develop the proposed program components. By 1975, nine AHECs were operational.

They number more than 10,000 people according to latest survey.Joshua Project estimates 7,000, with about 400 living across the Chinese border. SIL Ethnologue estimates 5,000 speakers of Puroik as of 2007. Some Puroik use Nishi as their primary language. Population estimates were somewhat higher in the 1990s, with 10,000 to 12,000 reported in the 1991 Indian census. They are a \\"Scheduled Tribe\\" in India. They claim kinship with the Khowa (Bugun). Economically, they are at a transitional stage between a hunter gatherer lifestyle and agriculturalism. They retain their traditional religion, with some adherence to either Hinduism or Christianity.

Secondary education in Singapore is largely public, and is compulsory until a child has reached 15 years of age. There are three main public secondary education streams: Express, Normal (Academic) (N(A)), and Normal (Technical) (N(T)), with special and private education courses also being available. At the end of public primary education, Singapore students take the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) and are placed into the different streams and secondary schools based on their results. The Express stream has a higher cut-off than the Normal (Academic) stream, which has a higher cut-off than the Normal (Technical) stream. Secondary students can move between streams based on their academic performance. The Express stream is a four-year course leading to the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Ordinary Level (O-level) examinations, while the Normal streams are four-year courses leading to the normal-level (N-level) examination. N(A) students take the N(A) examinations, which allows them to apply for local polytechnics and Institutes of Technical Education (ITE). After their N(A)-levels, students may also choose to remain in secondary education for an additional year to study for the O-levels, which allows students to enter junior colleges and the Millennia Institute. N(T) students take the N(T) examinations, which allows students to apply to the ITEs. After their N(T)-levels, students may choose to transfer to the N(A) stream to study an additional year for the N(A) examinations. Secondary 5 will be abolished in 2025. There are ongoing debates about the effectiveness of streaming, with some arguing that it should be abolished for its detrimental psychological effects, streaming will be abolished by 2025. Grade and scoring systems All secondary schools in Singapore standardises the academic grading system after the grading system awarded at the Singapore-Cambridge GCE O-Level examination, which a student sits at the end of four or five years of secondary education, taking at least 6 subjects. The level of achievement in each subject is indicated by the grade obtained, with A1 being the highest achievable grade and F9 being the lowest: * A1/A2 (Distinction) * B3/B4 (Merit) * C5/C6 (Credit/Pass) * D7/E8/F9 (Below O Level Pass) At the end of secondary education, only candidates that have attained C6 grade and above for at least 5 academic subjects will receive a School Graduation Certificate (SGC), whereas those above E8 will receive 'O' Level certificates. A student's overall academic performance is measured through several scoring systems (such as the L1R5, L1B5 and L1R4 scoring system) depending on which type of post- secondary institution a student is applying. Each grade has a point value respective to it, for example, with grade A1 being 1 point, A2 being 2 points, and B3 being 3 points. Thus, the lower the points obtained, the better the score. For example, in the L1R5 scoring system, the student's L1 or first language (either English or Higher Mother Tongue Language) and R5 or relevant 5 subjects (which must include at least one from the Science & Mathematics group, one from the Humanities group, and excluding subjects such as Religious Studies, Mother Tongue \\"B\\" and CCA). Consequently, an L1R5 score of 6 points is considered the best score attainable to enter a Junior College. A student requires an L1R5 score of less than 20 points to be eligible for Junior College. On top of that, students must also pass English and Mother Tongue examinations. For non-major examinations, several schools use the Mean Subject Grade (MSG) scoring system, while schools running the Integrated Programme (IP) also use the Grade Point Average (GPA) scoring system. Co-curricular activities \\"Co-Curricular Activities\\" (CCA) are compulsory at the secondary level, where all pupils must participate in at least one core activity, and participation is graded together with other achievements throughout the four years in a scoring system known as LEAPS (\\"Leadership, Enrichment, Achievement, Participation, Service\\"). There are many co-curricular activities offered at the secondary level, and each student is judged based in these areas. Competitions and performances are regularly organized. Co-curricular activities are often categorized under the following: Uniformed Groups, Performing Arts, Clubs & Societies and Sports & Games. Students may also participate in more than 1 CCA. =Uniformed groups= The main uniform groups are NCC (National Cadet Corps), NPCC (National Police Cadet Corps), NCDCC (National Civil Defence Cadet Corps), St John Ambulance Brigade, Red Cross Youth, Singapore Scout Association, Girl Guides, the Boys' Brigade and the Girls' Brigade. Students are expected to learn drills and must wear the respective uniforms. This is to prepare male students for National Service (NS) when they reach the age of 18. Besides military drills, they also learn skills such as team-bonding and first-aid. =Performing arts= Performing Arts CCAs vary from school to school, although most will include the Choir, Military/Concert/Symphonic Band, Chinese Orchestra, Dance groups for different ethnic cultures, Drama and Debate. Most are oriented towards performing and the musical arts. =Clubs and societies= There is a broad range of clubs and societies, ranging from Singapore Youth Flying Club to Robotics, Media and Infocomm Clubs and martial arts.  Special Assistance Plan  The Special Assistance Plan (Abbreviation: SAP; Chinese: ÁâπÂà´ËæÖÂä©ËÆ°Âàí) is a special programme in Singapore introduced in 1979 that caters to academically strong students who excel in both Chinese as well as English. The main objective of the programme is to preserve schools with strong cultural backgrounds and create bi-cultural environment, to allow capable students to master both these languages. The special programme were run in designated institutions that offers English and Chinese at first-language level under the Special stream (a variation of the Express stream, according to the education grading system in use since 1982). Nine secondary schools piloted the programme, which is deemed overwhelming successful with five of the designated schools consistently attaining top ten positions in the secondary school ranking in the 1990s, surpassing several established English-medium schools. Currently, eleven designated secondary schools offers the Special Assistance Plan, namely: * Anglican High School * Catholic High School * CHIJ St. Nicholas Girls' School * Chung Cheng High School (Main) * Dunman High School * Hwa Chong Institution * Maris Stella High School * Nan Chiau High School * Nanhua High School * Nanyang Girls' High School * River Valley High School Gifted Education Programme The Gifted Education Programme (GEP) was set up by the Ministry of Education in 1984 amid some public concern to cater to the intellectually gifted students. As of 2005, the schools participating consisted of 9 primary schools -- Anglo- Chinese School (Primary), Catholic High School (Primary), Henry Park Primary School, Nan Hua Primary School, Nanyang Primary School, Rosyth School, Tao Nan School, St. Hilda's Primary School, and Raffles Girls' Primary School. Seven secondary schools originally started the programme, but with the introduction of the Integrated Programme, most have folded the GEP programmes into their IP curriculum. The two remaining secondary GEP schools are Anglo-Chinese School (Independent), a school which provides both Cambridge 'O' Levels and the Integrated Programme, and is one of the top school globally in the International Baccalaureate, and Dunman High School, a mixed autonomous government school; the autonomous all-boys Victoria School had to suspend GEP classes due to low enrolment, with GEP students preferring IP schools. Pupils enter the programme through a series of tests at Primary 3, which will identify the top 1 per cent of the student population. A second selection used to be conducted at Primary 6 for those who do well in the PSLE, but this was discontinued after it was found to be too difficult for these students to catch up with the programme. In the programme, pupils are offered special enrichment programmes to cater for their needs. However, not all students in GEP are successful. Some are not accustomed to the fast pace of study which affects their performance in the core subjects and may choose not to continue the programme at the secondary level. The Secondary School Gifted Education Programme was discontinued at the end of 2008 as more students take the Integrated Programme (IP). Integrated Programme Hwa Chong Institution was one of the first four schools in Singapore to offer an Integrated Programme. The Integrated Programme, also known as the \\"Through-Train Programme\\" (Áõ¥ÈÄöËΩ¶), is a scheme which allows the most able secondary students in Singapore to bypass \\"O\\" levels and take \\"A\\" levels, International Baccalaureate or an equivalent examination directly at the age of 18 after six years of secondary education. First introduced in 2004, the programme allows for more time to be allocated to enrichment activities. By bypassing the GCE \\"O\\" level examinations, the students are supposedly given more time and flexibility to immerse themselves in a more broadly-based education. In addition, the students enjoy more freedom in the combination of subjects between Years 1 - 4 as compared to their non-IP counterparts. Generally, only the top performers (usually from Special, and sometimes Express, stream) are eligible to be part of the IP programme. This will ensure that the main body of the students pursue their secondary education at their own pace by first completing a 4-year \\"O\\" level course before going on to a 2-year \\"A\\" level education (as opposed to a 2-year \\"O\\" level and 4-year \\"A\\" level education). As a result, schools with an IP allow their students to skip the \\"O\\" levels at Secondary 4 and go straight into junior colleges (JCs) in Year 5/JC1. The Integrated Programme with the revised Singapore-Cambridge GCE \\"A\\" levels or the IB Diploma as a terminal qualification has become an increasingly popular alternative to the standard secondary education pathway. This is because it is perceived as having moved away from the usually heavy emphasis on the sciences, a phenomenon resulting from the post-independence need for quick and basic technical and industrial education; to subjects in the arts and humanities. Such programmes are more project-based and students are expected to be independent learners. The first batch of IP students sat for the revised GCE \\"A\\" Level or International Baccalaureate Diploma examinations in 2007. The schools offering the IP / IB programmes in Singapore are: * Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) (IP - IB) * Cedar Girls' Secondary School (IP, last two years at Victoria Junior College) * Dunman High School (IP + Bicultural Studies Programme) * Methodist Girls' School ( IP-IB 5th/6th year with ACS-I & O-levels 4yrs) * National Junior College (IP) * NUS High School of Mathematics and Science (IP - NUS High School Diploma) * Nanyang Girls' High School (IP + Bicultural Studies Programme, last two years at Hwa Chong Institution) * River Valley High School (IP + Bicultural Studies Programme) * Temasek Junior College (IP + Chinese Language Elective Programme) * Hwa Chong Institution (IP + Bicultural Studies Programme) * Raffles Institution (IP) * Raffles Girls' School (Secondary) (IP, last two years at Raffles Institution) * Victoria School (IP, last two years at Victoria Junior College) * St. Joseph's Institution (IP-IB) * Singapore Chinese Girls' School (IP, last two years at Eunoia Junior College) * CHIJ St. Nicholas Girls' School (IP, last two years at Eunoia Junior College) * Catholic High School (IP, last two years at Eunoia Junior College)  Specialised Independent Schools (SIS)  Specialised Independent Schools offer specialised education with different focuses. There are currently four specialised schools in Singapore. * NUS High School of Mathematics and Science, focuses on Mathematics, Science, Technology and Engineering. * School of Science and Technology, Singapore, focuses on applied learning in Science, Technology, Aesthetics, Engineering and Mathematics. * School of the Arts, Singapore, focuses on Visual, Literary and Performing Arts. * Singapore Sports Schools, focuses on Sports and Athletics. Admission to post-secondary institutions Upon completion of the 4- or 5-year secondary school education, students (excluding IP students) will participate in the annual Singaporean GCE 'O' Level, the results of which determine which pre- universities or post-secondary institutions they may apply for. Pre-university centres include Junior Colleges for a two-year course leading up to GCE 'A' Level, or the Millennia Institute for a three-year course leading up to GCE 'A' Level. Junior Colleges and the Millennia Institute accept students on merit, with a greater emphasis on academics than vocational-technical education. Students who wish to pursue vocational education go on to post- secondary institutions such as the polytechnics and the Institute of Technical Education (ITE), where they receive a diploma upon successful completion of their courses. Admission to a two-year pre-university course at Junior Colleges after graduating from secondary school is determined by the L1R5 (first language + 5 relevant subjects) scoring system. This scoring system is based on the 'O' Level subject grades, which range from A1 (best) to F9 (worst). The candidate adds the numerical grades for six different subjects: English (or another language taken at the 'first language' level), a Humanities subject, a Science/Mathematics subject, a Humanities/Science/Mathematics subject, and two other subjects of any kind. The best L1R5 unmodified score is therefore 6, for a student with A1 grades in six subjects which meet the criteria. Students scoring 20 points and below may be admitted for either a Science or Arts Course. Also, a student must achieve at least a C6 grade, which is 50% or higher, in the GCE 'O' Level English Language and Mathematics papers to qualify for Junior College admission. Pre- university centres that are particularly associated with academic excellence, however, usually expect students to attain points in the single digits, to be admitted. This is because the system is merit-driven, with places given to those with lower scores first. For admission to a three-year pre-university course at the Millennia Institute, the L1R4 (first language + 4 relevant subjects) scoring system is used, and students are expected to score below 20 points to be admitted. Students may opt for any of the science, arts or commerce streams when pursuing a three-year pre-university course. For students seeking admission to diploma courses in polytechnics, the L1R2B2 (first language + 2 relevant subjects + 2 best subjects of any kind) scoring system is used. However, students will also be required to meet specific prerequisites outlined by the different polytechnic schools they are applying for. Students applying for courses in the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) Colleges will also have an independent scoring system, depending on the course they are applying for. Bonus points can be deducted from a student's aggregate score, thus lowering it. These bonus points may come from either scoring an 'A' or 'B' grade in CCA, taking Higher Mother Tongue Language and obtaining a minimum of 'D7' or through affiliation (for feeder schools). Bonus points are capped at 4, except for those applying to schools offering Chinese Language Elective Programme (CLEP) or Malay Language Elective Programme (MLEP).  Private education  Most students in Singapore are educated through public schools, with a minority being home-schooled or educated in private schools. The Ministry of Education prohibits students who are Singapore citizens to be educated in private schools without prior permission granted. Admission to public schools for international students is not guaranteed and is based on aptitude and school vacancies.

His main interest was the railroad, about which he wrote many books and articles. He travelled extensively by rail and was a specialist in organizing railroad exhibitions. Early life Hungerford was born in Watertown, New York the son of Charles Anson Hungerford and his wife Cora Sill. He was a great great nephew of US Congressman Orville Hungerford.Find a Grave His parents operated a grocery store in Watertown until 1892, when they became owners of the Woodruff House, a much larger store, for 13 years. Hungerford was given a job there, running the elevator. He was educated at Watertown High School, and was then sent to Williston Seminary in Easthampton, Massachusetts. He was a poor student and much of his childhood he spent watching trains on the Rome, Watertown and Ogdensburg Railroad. His father wanted him to become an architect and he enrolled in an architecture program at Syracuse University. However he abandoned his studies in Syracuse, and went to Western New York, where in 1896 he obtained a job as a reporter with the Rochester Herald.Watertown Daily Times 'My greatest hobby is the railroad Sunday, July 5, 2009 Journalism After three years in Rochester, he obtained reporting and editing jobs with the Glens Falls Times, the Brooklyn Eagle, New York Evening Sun and the New York Herald. He continued writing, with the railroad industry becoming his main interest. For seven years he was press representative for the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company. He was also advertising manager for Wells Fargo & Company Express, and director of publications at the University of Rochester. Railroad exhibitions In 1925, Hungerford approached Daniel Willard, the president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and offered to write a history of the company, which was shortly to reach its centenary. Willard not only took up the suggestion, but also hired Hungerford to be the B&O;'s centennial director. Hungerford had seen a railroad celebration in England and created an extravagant exhibition at a park outside Baltimore. The \\"Fair of the Iron Horse\\" opened on February 28, 1927, including displays and a two-hour play, Pageant of The Iron Horse. It drew crowds averaging 50,000 a day. \\"His success in Baltimore became his chief calling card,\\"Curtis L. Katz Railfan & Railroad magazine November 2003 He created five more transportation pageants during the 1930s including the Rochester Centennial of 1934, the Parade of the Years Pageant in 1936 in Cleveland; and lastly \\"Railroads on Parade\\". The railroad display at the fair, which lasted until 1940, presented steam, electric and diesel engines brought from Canada, England and Italy. The attraction drew 2.6 million visitors during its two-year run. Travel Hungerford traveled annually more than 75,000 rail miles \\"just for the fun of it\\" and he calculated that over the years he had ridden more than 1.5 million miles on rails. He traveled occasionally to Europe and was in Italy in 1928 when he was received by Benito Mussolini. Hungerford continued to ride the rails, and while traveling in California in spring 1948 he was taken ill with an infection. His condition deteriorated on his train ride back to New York, where he was admitted to a hospital. He died at his home in New York City at the age of 72. Family Hungerford married Bertha R. Harbottle (1881‚Äì1940). They had a daughter Adrienna Hungerford Devereaux (1911‚Äì1955). Works Hungerford wrote two best selling books, Planning a Trip Abroad and With the Doughboy in France, a journal of experiences of World War I. Other works include * The American book of church services * The Genesee country & western New York... * Locomotives on Parade * The Modern Railroad * Men of Erie, a story of human effort * Railroads on Parade * A Railroad for Tomorrow * The romance of a great store * The Run of the Twentieth Century * The Story of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad 1827-1927 * The Story of Louis Sherry and the business he built * The Story of Public Utilities * The story of the Rome.

The building has been a Grade II Listed building since 18 November 1970. Description The front elevation is Georgian. The rear has been largely rebuilt but still has late Medieval windows. The rear part of the building is late-16th-century in date and is of box-framed construction, while the front part is 18th-century and was heightened in the 1800s. There is a Welsh slate roof. The building is of double depth central entry plan and is three storeys high. The centre door is narrow and panelled with a small pedimented hood. There is also a low pitch roof with a stack at either gable. The interior of the rear range is timber framed. The ground floor is box- framed and thought to date from about 1600. History The Vine Tree in 2012 The pub was originally called \\"The Coach and Horses\\" and is one of the longest surviving inns in the town. In 1792 the buildings were purchased by Thomas Hill, a maltster, for ¬£360. The building was actually two buildings before 1828. They were combined and the pub became \\"The Vine Tree\\" in 1820 under the management of James Hayward. In 1828 the pub was made up of a brewhouse, stables, cellars and gardens. When the Vine Tree was sold in 1842 details of occupations of people living in the rear of the inn revealed a gunsmith, cabinet maker, a tailor, a flax dresser, a baker, a glazier and a tea dealer. Ownership changed again in 1859 when Richard Jones purchased the inn for ¬£720. The pub was sold again in 1920 to Albert Johnstone. The next owner in 1940 was the Alton Court Brewery based in Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire. In 1962 it was owned by the West Country Breweries. The pub has also been owned by Whitbread.Heather Hurley, The Pubs of Monmouth Chepstow and The Wye Valley, Logaston Press, 2007, , page 52-55 The Vine Tree pub only opens by arrangement for special functions and is undergoing building work to convert it from a pub.

The group performs a variety of dance moves at the Chiefs' home in Arrowhead Stadium. The squad was originally a co-ed squad that was first formed in 1971, and eventually dropped the male cheerleaders, and renamed the squad as the Chiefettes. In 1986, the squad changed to its current name, and male cheerleaders returned. In 1997, the squad became all-female. The group's annual tryouts take place in April. Non-KCCC members can still join by participating in \\"Spirit Day\\", in which a group of 7th-12th grade cheerleaders performs with the squad at halftime. The group also makes various appearances at military bases, trade shows, commercials, convention, county fairs, talk shows, grand openings, autograph sessions, photo shoots, golf tournaments, charity functions, and auctions. The squad also has a \\"Junior Cheerleaders\\" program. However, the program is separated in 4 age divisions: Angel Chiefs for 3-5; Junior Chiefs for 6-12; The Satellite Program for 6-17; as well as the Teen Chiefs for ages 13‚Äì17. The squad also performs with Chiefs mascot KC Wolf, who also makes appearances. Similar to the drum line of the Chicago Bears, the Chiefs also have the \\"Rumble\\", a drum line consisting of male and female musicians who pump up the crowd at each home game, and at various community events with the cheerleaders and KC Wolf.

He is a member of the Republican Party. In the 2012 Republican primary election for the district, Yoho pulled a major upset against long-term incumbent U.S. Congressman Cliff Stearns, who had first been elected in 1988. Prior to being elected to Congress, Yoho had been a veterinarian and small business owner in North Central Florida for 30 years. In December 2019, Yoho announced that, honoring his term-limit pledge, he would not run for re- election to Congress in 2020. Early life, education, and veterinarian career Yoho was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on April 13, 1955. At age 11, he moved with his family to Florida, where he attended school with his future wife, Carolyn, in the 4th grade. Yoho earned his AA degree at Broward Community College. He earned a baccalaureate in animal science at the University of Florida in 1983 and thereafter attended the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine, from which he received a doctorate in veterinary medicine. He is a member of the American Veterinary Medical Association, Florida Veterinary Medical Association, Florida Association of Equine Practitioners, Florida Cattlemen's Association, and the National Rifle Association. U.S. House of Representatives 113th Congress) =2012 election= Yoho ran for the newly-redrawn . In the Republican primary he defeated longtime incumbent U.S. Congressman Cliff Stearns (who was first elected in 1988), State Senator Steve Oelrich, and Clay County Clerk of Court James Jett 34%‚Äì33%‚Äì19%‚Äì14%. Yoho defeated Stearns by 829 votes, or a 1.1 percentage point margin. Yoho won 11 of the district's 13 counties. Yoho won the November general election, 65% to 32%, against Democratic candidate J.R. Gaillot. =Tenure= Congressman Ted Yoho speaking at the 2013 Young Americans for Liberty National Convention Yoho took office on January 3, 2013. He is a member of the Tea Party Caucus and the House Liberty Caucus. He says that he supports reduction in taxes: replacing the current tax code with the Fair Tax (a broad national consumption tax on retail sales), reducing corporate tax rates, and eliminating federal programs that cannot be balanced with revenues. According to the CBO, there would still be a deficit even if all discretionary spending (all Federal programs except pensions, Medicare and Social Security) were stopped. Yoho advocates reducing spending and taxes, though has not yet introduced a plan that will lead to a balanced budget. Yoho also is opposed to raising the debt ceiling unless significant spending cuts are made; he is also opposed to earmarks in legislation. His district is one of the lowest-taxed in Florida, located primarily within Suwannee River Management District (lower proportion of property taxes), per capita retail sales in the district are significantly lower than the state average, and it has the fewest non-farm related businesses of Florida's congressional districts. Yoho has not made any indication on his level support of the farm bill. In 2014, Yoho was challenged by conservative Republican Jake Rush for his seat. Rush painted Yoho as a \\"liberal\\" and appealed to voters' conservatism to try to win the Republican nomination. In 2015, Yoho mounted a campaign to challenge John Boehner for the Speakership of the US House of Representatives in an attempt to get the conference to the second ballot. The block of dissenting members were four votes shy of achieving their goal. Of the 435 congressmen and congresswomen eligible to vote, Yoho received only two votes. He and his Democratic colleague John Conyers offered bipartisan amendments to block the U.S. military training of Ukraine's Azov Battalion of the Ukrainian National Guard. Some members of the battalion are openly white supremacists. =Controversies= While running for Congress in 2012, Yoho supported the controversial reduction of early voting by Florida Governor Rick Scott, though he stated it didn't reduce it enough. Yoho later joked that the right to vote was once limited exclusively to property owners. He also expressed support for the Bilderberg conspiracy theory. In 2013, he became widely known for his position on breaching the debt ceiling and defaulting on the national debt, which he claimed \\"would bring stability to the world markets.\\" This position was widely panned by Democrats and some Republicans such as fellow Republican Reid Ribble, who called the position \\"crazy talk.\\" In July 2020, Yoho accosted Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez over her public comments that an increase of crime in New York City was due to the high rise in poverty. According to a reporter from The Hill who overheard the conversation, the congressman called her \\"disgusting\\" and \\"out of your freaking mind.\\" Ocasio-Cortez called him \\"rude,\\" and reporters overheard Yoho calling her a \\"fucking bitch\\" as he walked away from the conversation. Ocasio- Cortez confirmed the incident on Twitter and on the House floor, but Yoho's office denied his comments, claiming that he \\"made a brief comment to himself as he walked away summarizing what he believes her policies to be: bullshit.\\" He later addressed the incident on the House floor, saying, \\"Having been married for 45 years with two daughters, I'm very cognizant of my language. The offensive name calling, words attributed to me by the press were never spoken to my colleagues and if they were construed that way, I apologize for their misunderstanding.\\" In July 2020, Nydia Vel√°zquez, a fellow Puerto Rican woman in congress, sat behind Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and nodded in agreement as Ocasio-Cortez addressed Congress and rebuked Yoho for having called her \\"a fucking bitch\\". In response, Ocasio-Cortez said, \\"Having a daughter does not make a man decent. Having a wife does not make a decent man. Treating people with dignity and respect makes a decent man.\\"Ocasio-Cortez delivers powerful speech after Republican's sexist remarks The Guardian On July 25, 2020 Bread for the World, a Christian non-profit organization, announced Yoho would no longer serve on its board, noting that Yoho's \\"recent actions and words as reported in the media are not reflective of the ethical standards expected of members of our Board of Directors.\\" =Legislation= During his first term of office, Yoho sponsored eighteen bills. One of the bills introduced during his first term, the Preventing Executive Overreach on Immigration Act of 2014, was passed by the House, but never voted on by the Senate. Yoho co-authored the Veterinary Medicine Mobility Act of 2014 (H.R. 1528; 113th Congress), a bill that would amend the Controlled Substances Act to clarify that veterinarians are not required to have separate registrations to dispense controlled substances outside of their principal place of business, such as when treating animals on a farm. Yoho is a co-sponsor of the Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015 (H.R. 3134). It has not moved since passing the House on September 18, 2015. On June 9, 2016, Yoho voted Nay on the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA, H.R. 5278) to restructure Puerto Rican debt. The Republican-authored bill passed the House with bipartisan support. =Committee assignments= * Committee on Agriculture ** Subcommittee on Horticulture, Research, Biotechnology, and Foreign Agriculture ** Subcommittee on Livestock, Rural Development, and Credit ** Subcommittee on Nutrition * Committee on Foreign Affairs ** Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific * Republican Study Committee =Caucus memberships= * United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus * Freedom Caucus * Veterinary Medicine Caucus  Political positions  = Gun policy = Yoho has stated that \\"the right to bear arms is a birthright and should never be threatened.\\" Yoho is a gun owner. He supports concealed carry laws and carries his gun with him when at home in Florida. Yoho has compared carrying a gun to carrying a cell phone in one's pocket. He says \\"I have the right to protect myself,\\" regarding concealed carry and \\"I feel like I have a very good aim. My wife is better.\\" He has co-sponsored bills to allow lawmakers to carry guns at the US Capitol and additional bills to allow individuals to carry guns nationwide, regardless of state law. In 2012, Yoho stated, \\"I am proud to say I hold an A rating from the NRA\\". From 2015‚Äì2016, Yoho accepted US$1,000 in direct campaign contributions from the NRA's Political Victory Fund; from 2012‚Äì2018, his total is US$4,000 from NRA sources. In March 2017, Yoho voted in favor of the Veterans Second Amendment Protection Act, which would have allowed veterans who are considered \\"mentally incompetent\\" to purchase ammunition and firearms unless declared a danger by a judge. The measure passed the House of Representatives, but ultimately stalled in the Senate. Yoho was one of the original co-sponsors of H.J.Res.40, which successfully used the Congressional Review Act to block implementation of an Obama-era amendment to the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 that was aimed at preventing the mentally- infirm from legally purchasing firearms. = LGBT rights = Yoho has a \\"0\\" rating from the Human Rights Campaign, indicating an anti-LGBT voting history. = Abortion = Yoho is anti-abortion. He believes there should be strict protection laws for fetuses. He has described abortion as a \\"hideous practice\\" which \\"needs to stop.\\" = Foreign policy = Yoho urged the Trump administration to impose sanctions against Chinese officials who are responsible for alleged human rights abuses against the Uyghur Muslim minority in China's northwestern Xinjiang region. In March 2019, Yoho and other lawmakers wrote a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that read in part, \\"This issue is bigger than just China. It is about demonstrating to strongmen globally that the world will hold them accountable for their actions.\\" He also delivered a speech on East Turkistan (Xinjiang) on the House floor, describing East Turkistan as an \\"occupied country\\" and condemned China for what he claims is its genocide of Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other Turkic peoples. = Drug policy = Yoho has a \\"B\\" rating from NORML, indicating a mixed voting history regarding cannabis-related causes. Yoho is not against veterans having access to medical marijuana if recommended by their Veterans Health Administration doctor and if it is legal for medicinal purposes in their state of residence. He supports industrial hemp farming. He voted in favor of preventing the DEA from funding the stop of medical marijuana operations in the states where they are legally operating. = Economic issues = Yoho voted in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Yoho acknowledges that the bill is \\"not perfect.\\" He believes the bill will \\"simplify the tax code\\" and \\"lighten the burden on all Americans\\" including middle-class families. =Lynching= On February 26, 2020, Yoho voted against making lynching a federal hate crime. He stated that he believed it was an \\"overreach of the federal government and tramples on states' rights to make their own legislation on the subject\\".

Aula365's comic no longer holds the record. As of 2019, Guinness World Records identify The Perilous Plights of Peter Pumpkinhead as the most contributors to a comic book, with 141 artists. Plot Adventures in the World of the Future begins at a school with one character forgetting about his biology experiment, for which he had been heating a meteorite extract for a week. When he gets to the lab, the experiment has turned into a portal to the future. Children, being curious by nature, enter the portal and find the future looks different. Society is going through a period of ignorance, caused by an evil scientist, who intends to obtain power and domination through fear. Through different adventures, the children find a way to let the rest of the society know about the scientist's plans. With the help of an old acquaintance, they solve the conflict, bringing truth to the world. The different topics the webcomic dealt with were meant to integrate the fun of reading a webcomic with several school-related topics. Some of those topics are the school in the future, experiments, life in space, food of the future, toys, holidays, communications in the future, clothes, sports, future leaders, and several others intended to set the children's imagination in motion and encourage their collaboration within a moderated online community for different ages.

Founded by couturi√®re Ada Masotti in Bologna in 1954, La Perla is one of few historical fashion houses with a woman founder. Ada Masotti was trained as a corset-maker. The current Creative Director of La Perla is Alessandra Bertuzzi who joined La Perla in 1987. History =Founding= La Perla was founded by master corsetmaker Ada Masotti in 1954 in Bologna, Italy, where the tradition of silk factories and textile manufacturing dates back to the 17th Century. While working in a local atelier, she was given the nickname ‚Äúgolden scissors‚Äù for her exacting cutting and tailoring abilities. Over time, Ada Masotti adapted her corset expertise to different kinds of lingerie, inventing styles and redefining how lingerie was considered and worn. =Evolution= The Masotti family redefined lingerie as a clothing accessory. Ada Masotti would drape fabric directly on the female body, achieving expert awareness of line and movement. Beginning in the 1950s, when female silhouettes were accentuated in fashion, Ada Masotti sought materials from Italian and international production such as Leavers lace woven on Calais looms, called Dentelle de Calais, and tulle embroidered in northern Italy and Switzerland. To adapt to the bright fashion statements of the 1960s, La Perla launched a lingerie line based on colorful, floral and checked patterns alongside the more traditional white, black and nude. In the 1970s, La Perla introduced the silk jersey triangle bra, which allowed for free- flowing movement and reflected fashion‚Äôs preference for a smaller bust. In 1978, La Perla launched its stretch lace sets, echoing the fashion of the day with its clinging dresses and natural flowing lines. During the mid-1960s, the founder decided to launch the first collections of bikinis and swimsuits. =International expansion= During the underwear boom that characterized the 1980s fashion scene the company started its international expansion under the guidance of Alberto Masotti, the founder's son. Alberto Masotti‚Äôs wife, Olga Masotti, was hired by Ada Masotti as a designer in 1972. In 1983 La Perla introduced the under-jacket, a lingerie item designed to be visible under the suiting of the era. Ada Masotti also created La Perla Maison, a collection featuring a range of garments in pure silk satin with embroidered inserts and frastaglio finishing, employing a technique that to this day is carried out by hand by the artisans of the La Perla atelier. In 1994 La Perla launched the Sculpture bra that introduced a new way of thinking about underwear: elegance was no longer the exclusive prerogative of materials like lace and tulle, but represented by creations with harmonious styling, made of smooth and soft fabrics. In 2000, Steinunn Sigurdard√≥ttir became the Creative Director of La Perla Ready to Wear. She introduced new fabrics and a swimsuit range.Sigur√∞ard√≥ttir, Steinunn. \\"Steinunn Sigur√∞ard√≥ttir.\\" Interview by Sigr√≠√∞ur Sigur√∞ard√≥ttir, Gunnar Hilmarsson, and P√°ll Hjaltason. Sj√≥n√æing Ger√∞ubergs 18 Mar. 2006: n. pag. Print. =Special Collections= To celebrate its 50th anniversary in 2004, La Perla put together a collection made with Valenciennes lace, produced on ancient mechanic looms of Calais, the most important Leavers lace centre in the world. In 2006 actor Daniel Craig wore in the 007 Casino Royale movie a pair of Grigioperla swimming trunks and this garment became a favourite in the La Perla boutiques worldwide. In 2012 Christie‚Äôs organized a special auction celebrating the 50th anniversary of the first Bond film and the La Perla trunks were sold for ¬£44,450. La Perla launched the Cage Bustier in 2007 worn by Victoria Beckham in the video of ‚ÄúHeadlines\\", the Spice Girls' reunion song. A capsule Cage collection was later launched, including the Cage top which received critical acclaim when worn by Beyonc√© for her 2014 Grammy Awards performance. In 2011 La Perla began a collaboration with French couturier Jean Paul Gaultier. That same year, La Perla entered the shapewear sector with ShapeCouture, which featured distinctive tailored cuts, tulle inserts and openwork finishes. =Acquisition and relaunch= In June 2013 Italian entrepreneur Silvio Scaglia and Pacific Global Management purchased La Perla at auction. Following the acquisition, the company was relaunched with a new development strategy. In the same year, La Perla launched the Made to Measure line, available in La Perla's major flagship stores. The service is dedicated to a select few exclusive creations, which become one-of-a-kind as they are made to measure, sewn by hand, personalized with an embroidered monogram, and made precious by embroidery in gold thread. The creations are only available by order. La Perla‚Äôs first Atelier collection showed during Couture Fashion Week in Paris in 2015, the brand‚Äôs first runway show in Paris. The designs for the collection took more than 14 months to sew by hand. The show was staged at the H√¥tel Salomon de Rothschild and the pieces displayed at the La Perla boutique in Paris on Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor√©. Top supermodels Naomi Campbell, Isabeli Fontana, Natasha Poly, and Lindsey Wixson joined Spring/Summer 2015 campaign stars Izabel Goulart, Sigrid Agren, and Ming Xi amongst the international models in the catwalk show. Products =Lingerie= La Perla lingerie is known for its corsetry and detailing. La Perla‚Äôs notable technique and materials include frastaglio appliqu√© technique, Leavers lace and embroidered tulle. One of the latest additions in La Perla range is La Perla Second Skin lingerie line launched in 2018. The line features seamless laser-cut underwear. =Beachwear= Ada Masotti made the foray into women's beachwear in 1965, launching the first collections of bikinis and swimsuits. =Sleepwear= La Perla produces nightwear with the same materials and colours of its lingerie collections. =Menswear= In 1985, the company extended its production to men's underwear and beachwear. In June 2014, La Perla held the first menswear catwalk show at Pitti Uomo in Florence, presenting the new concept men's loungewear and Beachwear collection. The collection included raffia robes, kimono-inspired gilets, and slim-cut swimming trunks. =Bags and shoes= The company also produces accessories lines. Current Creative Director Julia Haart has been designing shoes and bags collection since Spring/Summer 2016. =Perfume= The company expanded into perfume with their first fragrance, named simply La Perla, in 1986. A fragrance for men, named Grigioperla, was released in 1993. The bottles were created by designer Pierre Dinand. People =Ownership and shareholding= The company was led by founder Ada Masotti from 1954 to 1981. Her son Alberto Masotti, who, after earning a degree in Medicine from the University of Bologna decided to completely dedicate himself to the family business, led the company from 1981 to 2007. In October 2008, La Perla was sold to JH Partners, a San Francisco-based private equity firm established in 1986 and focused on investments in services companies and luxury brands. In June 2013 entrepreneur Silvio Scaglia and Pacific Global Management purchased La Perla at auction for ‚Ç¨69 million ($90 million). Pacific Global Management (PGM) also includes Elite Model Management and Women Management. Following the acquisition, the company was relaunched with a development strategy aimed at consolidating the identity of the brand. In February 2018 Sapinda Group of Lars Windhorst acquired La Perla. =Designers= Julia Haart was appointed Creative Director of La Perla in 2016, after working with the brand on accessories collaborations for two seasons. Haart's first collection, for Spring/Summer 2017, will present La Perla's women‚Äôs ready-to-wear offering. Boutiques La Perla sells its collections through a network of more than 150 flagship boutiques, both owned and franchised, in major cities around the world. The first La Perla boutiques opened internationally in 1991. It also has a presence in the main department stores and specialized shops. In 2014, Italian architecture studio Baciocchi Associati, who did interiors for Miu Miu and Prada boutiques, redesigned the interiors concept for La Perla global flagships. The new design concept was adopted in the existing flagship stores such as the historic boutiques of Sloane Street in London, via Montenapoleone in Milan and Madison Avenue in New York City as well as new boutiques such as the five-storey building in Old Bond Street in London, the boutique in Russell Street in Hong Kong and the building in Aoyama, Tokyo. Publications In 1997, collaborations with Italian photographer Marino Parisotto resulted in the publication of a photographic volume, Senso, portraying new La Perla styles. Senso was dedicated to the world of corsetry seen through the female gaze. In 2012, Rizzoli New York City published La Perla. Lingerie & Desire, the first monographic book dedicated to the brand and its evolution over almost sixty years. Some chapters are dedicated to the history of the La Perla products, marketing (the origins, the 1960s, the 1970s, the 1980s and the 1990s) and advertorial images, while others are linked to \\"symbolic aesthetic concepts\\" such as Black, White, Body, Inspirations, Precious and Eros. Campaigns The Spring/Summer 2014 campaign, shot by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott with art direction by Fabien Baron and styling by Ludivine Poiblanc, featured models Cara Delevingne, Liu Wen and Malgosia Bela. The three supermodels were chosen to represent the many facets of a woman's world ‚Äî the guiding concept of the new La Perla advertising campaign for their Spring/Summer 2014 season. Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott under the artistic direction of Fabien Baron returned for the Fall/Winter 2014 campaign, whilst supermodels Mariacarla Boscono and Daria Strokous joined Spring/Summer 2014 protagonist Liu Wen. The campaign began with the debut of the new La Perla Made to Measure collection and the premiere of the exclusive backstage film. The Spring/Summer 2015 campaign saw models Izabel Goulart, Sigrid Agren and Ming Xi lead as La Perla campaign stars, joined for the first time ever by a male protagonist ‚Äî model Richard Biedul.

Peace Park Plitvice-Una Proximity to Plje≈°ivica mountain virgin forest, which stretches between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia, and Croatia's Plitvice Lakes National Park makes Una National Park a top destination for visitors. More importantly, all of the facts about these two National Parks, their proximity, natural, cultural and historical richness, brings out the possibility and makes viable idea of joint management and promotion. The Plitvice Lakes National Park has been inhabited by strong conquerors that lived centuries ago, including Celts, Romans or Ottomans. Nowadays, the park, which occupies nearly 297 square kilometers, is protected by law and for good reason. While there is a large number of sightseeing objectives in this area, most tourists come to watch the 16 interconnected lakes linked to one another by a series of rivers and spectacular waterfalls. Ever since the 19th century, when locals began building hotels here, tourists were given the chance of walking over rivers and woods on specially designed bridges. One of the most beautiful objectives here, Veliki Slap, is the tallest waterfall in Croatia; as tourists admit, watching the water coming from the Plitvice stream and falling down on the 78 meters high rocks covered in plants is, indeed, a unique experience.
