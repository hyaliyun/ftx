He served as a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War. After the war, Fuller engaged in the wholesale footwear trade as well as in civil affairs in Ohio. Early life and career John W. Fuller was born in the village of Harston, located in the English county of Cambridgeshire. His father was a minister of the Baptist faith and also a graduate of Bristol College in England, and was responsible for much of Fuller's primary education. In 1833, Fuller relocated with the family to Oneida County, New York. There, the rest of his education came from reading in a bookstore in Utica, and starting in 1841, Fuller began working there.Warner, p. 164. By 1852, Fuller owned and operated a publishing business in Utica and was later the city's treasurer. He was also active in the New York State Militia, serving as an officer. In 1853, Fuller married Anna B. Rathbun, also a resident of Utica. The couple would have six children together: three sons named Edward, Rathbun, and Frederick, and three daughters named Florence (later married to Thomas A. Taylor), Jennie, and Irene. In 1858, Fuller's business was destroyed by a fire, and he moved to Toledo, Ohio, where he again began operating a book publishing firm. Civil War service When the American Civil War began in 1861, Fuller chose to follow his home state and the Union cause. He was ordered to train soldiers in Grafton, Virginia, which is in modern-day Taylor County, West Virginia. He also briefly served on the staff of Brig. Gen. Charles W. Hill. On August 18, Fuller was given command of the 27th Ohio Infantry with the rank of colonel.Eicher(2), p. 246. Fuller and the 27th first served in Missouri under Brig. Gens. John Pope and David Hunter. He and his command then participated in Pope's efforts at New Madrid on March 14, and then the Battle of Island Number Ten from February 28 to April 8, 1862. Fuller as a Union colonel In the fall of 1862, Fuller was given brigade command in the Army of the Mississippi. He led it in Mississippi during the Battle of Iuka on September 19, and the Second Battle of Corinth on October 3-4. On December 31, his command fought at Battle of Parker's Cross Roads in Tennessee. During the battle, Fuller's brigade approached undetected and got behind Confederate Brig. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest's position. Left with no choice but to attack the Federal forces in his front and rear, Forrest had his men charge and repel Fuller's command, and then quickly reverse and move past and through the rest of the Union soldiers. Fuller and the other Federal units managed to capture six pieces of artillery, about 300 prisoners and 350 horses, but Forrest's scattered men were able to escape and recrossed the Tennessee River four days later.Eicher(1), p. 389. Fuller spent most 1863 on garrison duty within the Army of the Tennessee, and was promoted to brigadier general on January 5, 1864. In March 1864, Fuller led his command across the Tennessee River and captured the city of Decatur, Alabama. He participated in the Atlanta Campaign that summer, and temporarily lead a division during the Battle of Atlanta on July 22. He again led his brigade during the March to the Sea in late 1864, and in the Carolinas Campaign of 1865.Warner, p. 165. Fuller was brevetted to the rank of major generalWarner, p. 165: \\"for meritorious service during the war\\" in the Union Army on March 13, and after the end of the war he resigned that fall. Fuller was one of the few generals in the Civil War who was not born in the United States. Postbellum John Wallace Fuller Fuller resigned from the Union Army on August 15, 1865, and returned to his civilian life in Ohio. He was the senior partner of the firm Fuller, Childs & Company in Toledo, a business dealing in the wholesale of boots and shoes. In 1874, Fuller was appointed the collector of customs for Toledo, a post he held until 1881. On October 3‚Äì4, 1878, the members of the \\"Ohio Brigade\\" held a reunion at Columbus, Ohio, in which Fuller attended and made a speech. During the event, a permanent organization was created for future reunions, with Fuller as its first president. In 1888, he retired from his business concerns. Fuller was in Toledo when he died in 1891 and he was buried in the city's Woodlawn Cemetery.

A deer-vehicle collision occurs when one or more deer and a human-operated vehicle collide on a roadway. It can result in deer fatality, property damage, and human injury or death. The number of accidents, injuries, and fatalities varies from year to year and region. In the United States, an estimated 1.23 million deer related accidents occurred in a one- year period ending June 2012 (a 7.7 percent increase from the previous year), resulting in $900,305 in average property damage. The largest proportion of such accidents occur in November. In 2000, of the 6.1 million lightweight motor vehicle collisions in the US, 1 million involved animal-vehicle collisions. Deer‚Äìvehicle collisions lead to about 200 human deaths and $1.1 billion in property damage every year.Allan, William F, and Wells, Joann K. \\"Characteristics of Vehicle-Animal Crashes in Which Vehicle Occupants Are Killed.\\" Traffic Injury Prevention 6 1 (2005) 56‚Äì59 State and federal governments, insurance companies, and drivers spend an additional $3 billion in an effort to reduce and manage the increasing number of deer-vehicle collisions.National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Fatality Analysis Reporting System Data File. 2001‚Äì2002. http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov. The term \\"deer-vehicle collision\\" is commonly annotated throughout safety agencies as DVC. In Canada during the year 2000, there were nearly 29,000 animal-vehicle collisions resulting in property damage only, an additional 1,887 involving non-fatal injuries, and 23 fatal collisions. In Germany, over 220,000 traffic collisions occur annually involving deer, over 1000 of which lead to human injuries and around 20 to human fatalities. History of the deer Deer‚Äìvehicle collisions have occurred since roadways have been built in close and direct proximity to direct habitat, also known as deer habitat fragmentation. White-tailed deer, the most common deer involved in deer- vehicle collisions, have steadily increased in numbers since the turn of the 20th century. Currently, it is estimated that 20 to 30 million deer populate North America. The actual number of animals killed in deer-vehicle collisions is not known because no such database exists. In a 1981 study, it was concluded that \\"large animals,\\" which included deer, accounted for 26% of animals killed each year in collisions with vehicles on interstates and country roads.Black, William R. Transportation: A Geographical Analysis. New York: Guilford Press (2003) The expansion and technological advances of roadways in the US have increased the number of deer-vehicle collisions. The increased amount of habitat fragmentation, due to expanding technology, has increased the likelihood of a deer-vehicle collision. In the United States, the state with the highest number of deer-vehicle collisions is Pennsylvania, with an estimated 115,000 collisions in 2013 causing $400 million in damage. West Virginia is the state with the highest risk that a motorist will hit a deer whilst driving. Contributing factors Roadkilled deer on the Okatie Highway, South Carolina, USA. The main contributing factor of a deer-vehicle collision has been contested among studies and statistics. Many factors are yet to be identified or understood. At this point, a main factor in all deer- vehicle collisions has not been concluded, but the most argued is the proximity of roadways to deer-populated forestry. Significant factors also include: urban population and deer density. Also, studies have shown that, nationally, most deer vehicle collisions occur between May and November because of deer mating season and foraging before the winter months. =Habitat fragmentation= Habitat fragmentation occurs when human technology encroaches upon the natural habitats of animals. As humans live in closer proximity to other animals, they are more likely to encounter one another. The most common type of habitat fragmentation across the United States is roadways and highways in forests and other deer-inhabited areas.Fulbright, Timothy E., Ortega, Alfonso. White Tailed Deer Habitat. Kingsville: Texas A&M.; Because highways are isolated points of fragmentation, deer wander about them freely because they see little to stay away from. Roadways and highways located in sparsely-populated areas are usually built along rivers and lakes of mountains and plains. These areas attract deer because they render safe havens and excellent foraging. Roadways and highways within densely populated deer habitat lead to more prevalent deer-vehicle collisions. =Time= A contributing factor to deer-vehicle collisions is the time of day at which motorists travel through deer habitation.TransSafety Inc. \\"Deer-Vehicle Collisions are Numerous and Costly. Do Countermeasures Work?\\" Road Management & Engineering Journal. (1997) During the daytime, motorists can more easily see and avoid hitting deer. At night, most especially during the dusk and dawn hours, deer are much harder to see, which increases the chance of collision.

Arikesari's reign witnessed the beginning of the Pandya contest with the Pallavas in the northern Tamil country. He probably entered into an alliance with Chalukyas (to the counter the Pallavas). The Pandyas also came into collision with the Cheras (\\"Keralas\\") under his rule.  Period  Arikesari Maravarman was the successor of Seliyan Sendan (Jayantavarman), but it is not known for certain if he was Jayantavarman's son or not (most probably his son). * K. A. Nilakanta Sastri (the first assumption) - c. 670-710 CE * K. A. Nilakanta Sastri (revised date) - c. 670-700 CE * T. V. Sadasiva Pandarathar - c. 640-670 CE *Noburu Karashima - c. 650-700CE (or) c. 670-700 CE He was succeeded by his son Kocchadaiyan Ranadhira.  Names  In the Velvikkudi Grant and the Smaller Sinnamanur Plates, his name appears as \\"Arikesari Maravarman\\". In the Larger Sinnamanur Plates, he is called \\"Arikesari Parankusa\\".  Life and career  =Velvikkudi Grant= The reign of Arikesari Maravarman probably saw a significant increase in the Pandya political power and prestige. According to the Velvikkudi Grant, Arikesari Maravarman won battles at Pali, Nelveli, and Uraiyur. In Nelveli, he is said to have conquered the vast forces of certain Vilveli. The victory at Nelveli is confirmed by the Larger Sinnamanur Plates. Except Uraiyur (Tiruchirappalli), the identity of these places is not certain. E. Hultzsch tentatively identified Nelveli with modern Tirunelveli, but K. A. N. Sastri disagreed with this identification. =Larger Sinnamanur Plates.= The Larger Sinnamanur Plates states that Arikesari \\"Parankusa\\" won battles at Nelveli and Sankaramangai. The inscription further states that he ruined the Paravars (people on the south-east coast of the Pandya country) who did not submit to him and destroyed the people of Kurunadu. According to one theory, \\"Kurunattar\\" refers to people of Kurunadu (an unidentified place); another possibility is that the term refers to petty chieftains. Arikesari is also said to have defeated an unspecified enemy at Sennilam, which may refer to a particular place or is a generic term for \\"Red (Bloody) Battlefield\\". Finally, the inscription states that he defeated the Keralas (the Cheras) multiple times, and once imprisoned their king with his near relatives and warriors. = Role in the Chaluya-Pallava conflict = Arikesari Maravarman seems to have joined with the Chalukyas in their struggle against the Pallavas. Early in the rule of Pallava king Parameswara I, Chalukya Vikramadtiya I advanced south and even displaced the Pallava from his capital Kanchi. The Chalukya then advanced further south to the Kaveri River and encamped at Uraiyur (where he probably effected a junction with Arikesari Maravarman). =Literary sources = Commentary to the Iraiyanar Ahapporul mentions a king named Arikesari, with titles Parakusan and Nedumaran among others. The commentary also mention several battles, at Pali, Sennilam and Nelveli and at Vizhinjam, some of which the scholars do not read in epigraphy till late 8th century. Based on this, historian Venkayya assumed that the two rulers are identical. However, K. A. N. Sastri rejected this identification on the basis that \\"a rhetorical work like this took for its hero a saintly king of legendary fame, and attributed to him all the achievements of the Pandyan lines of kings that the author could think of his day\\".  Religion  Arikesari is known to have performed the Hiranyagarbha and Tulabhara rituals (a number of times). = Identification with Nedumaran = Arikesari Maravarman is sometimes identified with Pandya king Nedumaran or Kuna Pandya, who converted from Jainism to Shaivism under the influence of the bhakti saint Sambandar. Kun Pandya was thence regarded as a saint himself. The legend is considered as an expression of the historical consciousness (signifying the loss of Jain political influence in the Tamil coutry). According to this legend, Kun Pandya had married the Chola princess Mangayarkkarasi.

By patent for life he was created chancellor and vicar-general of the diocese of Rochester in 1686, where he was an advocate of moderation in a feverish time,Pleading for Bishop Henry Compton in 1686. and master of the faculties and judge of the Admiralty Court under William III, succeeding Sir Richard Raines, 1 June 1689, in which post he remained until his death, his expertise serving Parliament on numerous occasions. He was knighted shortly after his accession, on 4 June 1689.Cruickshanks, Hayton and Handley 2002. Hedges was returned as MP for Orford in 1698, under the aegis of Ormonde as Chancellor of Oxford,His parliamentary career is summarised in Cruickshanks, Hayton and Handley 2002:317-26. but after counter-petitions were presented, Hedges and his colleagues were unseated by an election committee (1 February 1700), confirmed in the House by a majority of one vote (10 February) In the brief parliament of February 1701 Hedges sat for Dover, and at the election in November 1701 he was returned for Malmesbury and for Calne. His opponents endeavoured to eject him from both places, and the election for Calne was voided, but the petition against his return for Malmesbury failed. At the next election (August 1703) he was again returned for both Calne and Malmesbury and elected to serve for Calne. He unsuccessfully contested the constituency of Calne again in 1705 and 1708, but nevertheless retained a seat in parliament, as he was thrice (1705, 1708, 1710) returned for West Looe, and once (1713) for East Looe. Hedges was a Tory supporter of Court policy, a client of Lord Rochester in contemporary eyes, but with manifest talent as a civilian lawyer,Cruickshanks, Hayton, Handley 2002:325 who usually voted in his own individual interest. Mainly through the influence of the Earl of Rochester he was sworn as secretary of state and privy councillor (5 November 1700), when he was allowed by special permission of the king to remain judge of the Admiralty Court, and he continued to be judge until 29 December 1701. The Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, supporting the Whig interest, said of him, \\"He has no capacity, no quality nor interest, nor ever could have been in that post but that everybody knows my Lord Rochester cares for nothing, so much as a man that he thinks will depend upon him'\\"Her ms Account of Conduct quoted in Cruickshanks, Hayton, Handley 2002: He attended Queen Anne to Bath in August 1702, and for a short time (April to May 1704) he was declared the sole secretary, both home and foreign, until a successor was appointed to the Earl of Nottingham. During 1706 the Whigs constantly endeavoured to eject Hedges from office to make room for the Earl of Sunderland, and the queen at last submitted. The change was announced on 8 December 1706, but Hedges was mollified by promise of an appointment to the Prerogative Court of Canterbury, which came about in January 1711 on its vacation by Sir Richard Raines.

View of the excavated house. Map of Jerusalem's Jewish Quarter showing the Burnt House. The Burnt House Museum (aka Katros House) is a museum presenting an excavated house from the Second Temple period situated six metres below current street level in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem. History The Burnt House is believed to have been set on fire during the Roman destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE. According to Josephus, Jerusalem's Upper City was known for its wealth. It was located close to the Temple and inhabited by priestly families who served in the temple. The house was destroyed one month after the Temple and Lower City. When the Romans stormed the Upper City, they found little resistance: Much of the population was near death from disease and starvation. Archaeological excavations Following the 1967 reunification of Jerusalem the Jewish quarter was rebuilt, and extensive archeological excavations were conducted in the area. The excavations were carried out from 1969 to 1982 under the auspices of the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the Israel Exploration Society and the Israel Department of Antiquities (today, the Israel Antiquities Authority). The excavations were headed by Dr Nahman Avigad. =Findings= In 1970 one of the findings of the Avigad excavations was the Burnt House, which was found under a layer of ashes and destruction, indicating that the house had been burned down. The house is only part of a large complex, which could not be fully excavated and still lies under the Jewish Quarter. Coins were found in the house issued by the Roman governors of Judea, as well as those issued by the Jewish rebels in 67‚Äì69 CE and none that were later than that, indicating that the house was burned down at the end of this time. Outline, rooms The ground floor of the Burnt House was exposed to reveal a house with an area of about 55 (32 ft) square. It included a small courtyard, four rooms, a kitchen and a mikvah (ritual bath). The walls of the house, built of stones and cement and covered with a thick white plaster, were preserved to a height of about one meter. In the beaten-earth floors of the rooms were the sunken bases of round ovens made of brown clay, indicating perhaps that this wing of the house was used as a workshop. The courtyard of the house was paved with stone, and through it one reached the kitchen and the other rooms. Three of these were medium-sized and a fourth, a side room, extremely small. The very small mikvah is covered with gray plaster and has four steps descending to its bottom. In the corner of the kitchen was a stove, basalt grinding-stones next to it, and a large stone tray. Several stone jars were also found in the kitchen. The occupants probably used the heavy stone kitchenware, rather than pottery, because according to Halacha they do not contract ritual impurity. This suggests the occupants were a priestly family, who had to maintain their cleanness in order to work at the temple. This is also indicated by the presence of the mikvah. Conflagration traces Throughout the house are stones burnt by an intense fire, scorched wooden beams and layers of ash and soot that testify to the huge fire that raged here. Its walls and wood-beamed ceilings collapsed in a conflagration, sealing an abundance of diverse objects in its rooms. And scattered in disarray among the collapsed walls, ceilings and the second story, were fragments of stone tables and many ceramic, stone and metal vessels, iron nails found in the ruins are all that was left of the wooden roof, the shelves and furnishings which were completely burnt. Small objects Also found were inkwells, Roman-period oil lamps that were used to light up the house during the evenings, and other household items, the large jugs, bowls and measuring cups, indicating that this was a perfume production workshop. Leaning against a corner of a room was an iron spear, which may have belonged to one of the Jewish fighters who lived here. Drainage channel A covered drainage channel from the Roman period. According to the historian Josephus, some of the last Jewish rebels to hold out against the Romans hid in tunnels such as this. Human remains In the room identified as the kitchen, the forearm bones from the finger tip to the elbow joint of a woman approximately 25 years old were discovered. Since the bone is almost certainly that of a Jewish woman, it was buried in accordance with Jewish law, but pictures of the findings are on display. Kathros family Also found in the house were a round stone weight, 10 cm in diameter, on it, in square Aramaic script was the Hebrew inscription (of) \\"Bar Kathros\\", meaning the \\"son of Kathros\\"; this indicating that the house belonged to the Kathros family. According to the Talmud, the Kathros family was a priestly family that had abused its position in the Temple. The Talmud describes them in Pesahim 57A in a poem that lists the priestly families that abused their positions in the temple as follows: The attack for misusing their pens may mean they spread false rumors or misinformation. Although someone may have carried this weight from another house, the Bar Kathros family certainly had a house in Jerusalem, given their priestly position, and this one is a good candidate. Museum Multimedia presentation at the museum about the family who lived in the house. The excavated house is open to the public, and its artifacts are on display in the small museum near the room. The 12-minute audio-visual presentation, set up inside the house, plays back the nearly 2,000-year-old events: the preparations of the revolt against the Romans, the different political opinions of the family members, news on the approaching Roman Legions, the destruction of the temple, the storming of both the city and the house, then ending with the torching of the house.

J. MacHale. It concludes the battle between the Travelers and Saint Dane. The title was revealed by D. J. MacHale on December 9, 2008, and was taken from a closing line in the preceding book, Raven Rise. The jacket cover was revealed on March 3, 2009; the book itself was released on May 12, 2009. Summary The Soldiers of Halla begins with the eleven Travelers, meeting in a crumbling wasteland of a city. They are immediately attacked by a helicopter, forcing them to seek refuge in the buildings. Bobby and Loor are trapped in a pit and watch as a colony of people are caught by the helicopters in a nearby building. When the helicopters leave, however, the Travelers gather back together. The first generation of Travelers quickly appear, such as Osa, Loor's mother, and Seegen, Kasha's father, and lead the other Travelers away. Bobby is met by his family again, who tell him that the wasteland was in fact the New York City zoo on Third Earth. His family leads Bobby to another place, that is filled with dark clouds and crumbling, dark matter. They confess that they know all that has transpired in Halla so far, including Bobby's murder of Alexander Naymeer on Second Earth. Moreover, they tell him that Solara is indeed the essence of Halla and thus the ten territories. Each victory and defeat inflicted by the Travelers and Saint Dane is reflected in the overall health of Solara. All of the souls of Halla are transferred to Solara after they pass on in Halla. The exiles that were launched into the flume are the last remaining positive spirit. The rest is the negative spirit influencing Saint Dane's evil Solara. Bobby travels to several worlds, including Third Earth, where Mark had been sent, and is leading a group of other exiles and rebels of Ravinia. Eventually, after visiting other worlds, he returns to Third Earth. He learns from Nevva that the exiles are on Eelong. Saint Dane finds out that Nevva betrayed him, and kills her, not allowing her spirit to return to Solara. Bobby goes to Eelong, and reaches Black Water just before the klees (cats that are the sentient species of the jungle-like territory of Eelong) are going to attack the exiles and the gars (humans that are not quite as intelligent as the klees.) The travelers defeat them and go back to Solara. Uncle Press then proposes that they should protect the exiles as they are the only positive energy that keeps Solara running. Bobby proposes that Uncle Press's plan would only delay defeat. He thinks they should make a portal and transport the exiles to the Ravinians on Third Earth and defeat the Ravinians. The plan is successful and they take the Ravinian conclave. Bobby finds and gets into a fight with Saint Dane, and as Saint Dane uses up all of his power, he dies. As the Travelers are victorious, all of Halla is saved from a fatal disaster. After he destroys Saint Dane, Bobby and the other travelers are allowed to live the life they would have had if they weren't travelers. The readers are shown Bobby and Courtney Chetwynde in a scene mirroring their first scene in the series. However, it is shown that rather than the young teens as before, this Bobby and Courtney are much older, Bobby himself being confined to a hospital bed. They kiss as a mysterious stranger (probably Uncle Press Tilton) barges into Bobby's hospital room and gives Bobby a box containing a \\"story\\". This \\"story\\" is actually Bobby's Journals. The series ends with Courtney reading aloud the first journal. Trivia Bobby Pendragon wrote a grand total of 37 journals throughout his entire journey as a Traveler.

The film stars Yukta Mookhey and Vijay Raaz.Yahoo! India Movies Memsahab is a woman- oriented movie with a social message of non-violence. In Memsahab, Yukta has to be lauded for staged a comeback with a sincere effort. She has adorned a bold new look in this flick. Yukta admits that getting into the character of a prostitute was a bit tough and bold too but she portrayed it with honesty. Her idol is Shabana Azmi who played an award-winning role of a prostitute in ‚ÄòMandi‚Äô. Synopsis Memsahab is based on the cruel incidents post the 1984 riots between a section of Congress party activists and the Sikhs in Delhi and other parts of North India.. Ensuing these riots, the Sikhs were targeted by the Congress party activists and several Sikh families were ruined. Yukta Mookhey plays the character of Anjali, who is a victim of the riots and is pushed into prostitution. This young girl Anjali‚Äôs mother is raped by the villains and her father is shot dead. What a horrifying impact would this have on the girl! This Anjali grows up with such traumatic memories of her childhood. The director seeks to portray reality by actually shooting in a few bye lanes of Kamathipura (a red light area in Mumbai), where Anjali is one of the many women indulging in flesh trade. Every night, this woman has a new ‚ÄòSahab‚Äô. Some unexpected incidents take place and she stumbles upon the killers of her parents. She starts searching for them and hunting them one by one. In the process where she takes revenge on the killers of her dad, she realizes that the violence wouldn't help her get back her victimized parents. She then realizes that even after taking revenge she still could not erase her traumatic memories of childhood. Wisdom dawns on her and then she takes startling decision in the end.

He is also a notable rock climber of long standing, who established a number of widely known climbing routes particularly in the northeastern United States. Rock climbing In the 1950s and 60s, Reppy was active on Ragged Mountain in Connecticut where he collaborated on many first ascents and on publishing an area guidebook with Sam Streibert. The well-known Reppy's Crack on Cannon Mountain in New Hampshire bears his name and he has made first ascents as of number of routes in the Shawangunks and elsewhere. He made early attempts on Armadillo, a long alpine rock climb on Mount Katahdin, Maine. In addition, he has climbed extensively in England, the Alps and western America. Reppy has said his earliest interest in rock climbing as a very young teenager was related to the re-opening of small open-pit mica mines in eastern Connecticut during World War II in response to increased war-time demand for electronics materials. Reppy was among the first climbers in the United States to practice so-called \\"clean climbing\\" techniques, which he learned in England. While most climbers of the day were hammering their way up the cliffs with pitons, Reppy helped introduce the use of nuts, which at the time consisted of hex nuts from truck wheels, strung with nylon webbing. Unlike pitons, nuts are placed and removed without the use of hammers and save the rock from permanent damage. The technique often makes placements easier and faster to achieve, and thus may make difficult climbs easier to complete. Many advances in rock climbing were made possible by this method. Among a substantial number of others deserving credit for this trend in the U.S. are Yvon Chouinard and John Stannard. Scientific contributions Reppy received a bachelor's degree in math and physics in 1954 at University of Connecticut and a master's degree from the same school two years later. He completed a Ph.D at Yale University in 1962, where he spent four years as an assistant professor. Reppy joined the Cornell Physics Department in 1966, later becoming the John Wetherill Professor of Physics. He is the recipient of numerous awards and honors, including the Fritz London Memorial Prize in 1981 and the NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal for leadership and support to the NASA microgravity fundamental physics program in 2000. Reppy is also a member of the National Academy of Sciences. As physics professor at Cornell University, he studies quantum properties of superfluids with an emphasis on boundary conditions and phase transitions in systems of reduced dimensionality. His research group has a close association with those of David M. Lee and Robert C. Richardson also of Cornell, who shared the 1996 Nobel Prize in Physics with Douglas D. Osheroff for discoveries related to super fluidity in helium-3 ice. Lee, in his Nobel Prize speech, credited Reppy's \\"extraordinary technical ingenuity\\" in experiments leading to the discovery. In the speech, Lee made other references to Reppy, noting that his work helped confirm related insights. Reppy also figured at least on the fringes of the 2001 Nobel Prize for Physics which was awarded to Eric Cornell and Carl Wieman of the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics, or JILA, in Boulder, Colo., and Wolfgang Ketterle of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensation was predicted in 1924, and was seen decades ago in liquid helium, according to Ketterle, who acknowledged a controversial earlier claim by Reppy. Ketterle says that Reppy brought this finding to his attention, and that the priority claim was fair. \\"I think the results appeared conclusive\\", Ketterle reportedly said. But co-laureate Wieman said that Reppy's claim is \\"really a stretch\\" and that Ketterle may have acknowledged the helium experiments merely to appease Reppy. \\"Ketterle is being gracious\\", Wieman reportedly said, \\"and Reppy makes a lot of noise.\\" Physicists generally agree that the atoms in superfluid helium-4 is not a Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensate in the original sense of the term because its atoms interact too strongly. Reppy studied an exception: tiny amounts of helium trapped in nanometer-sized pores of a spongelike glass called Vycor. Even though the pores keep its atoms too far apart to jostle one another much, the helium still behaves like a three-dimensional fluid. In 1983 Reppy and colleagues reported results that suggested the helium was sloshing through the glass as a true Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensate. Separately, work from Cornell physics laboratories has been used to test a theory of cosmic strings, hypothetical objects, which may have been important in the formation of galaxies, and may have arisen through \\"phase transitions\\" in a fraction of a second after the Big Bang.

His work has been published in many European countries including France, England, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Swiss, Italy as well as worldwide in the United States, China and Japan. Biography Marazano was born in Fontenay- aux-Roses, near Paris. After short scientific studies, he was introduced by artist Moebius to several comics publishers. He was formerly pushed into comics by artist Jean Giraud, better known as Moebius, who advised him for a few years and introduced him to several publishers. He also collaborated to the atelier Sanzot, an Atelier gathering several French artists in Angoul√™me. Meeting and collaborating with Victor Delafuente and Antonio Parras in Paris had a major influence over his art and inking. Despite being also a penciller, Marazano mostly works as writer with other artists. In 2003 he created Cuervos, a series set in Colombia and telling the deeds of a killer in the drug traffic of the Medell√≠n Cartel. The series artist was Michel Durand, and it was acclaimed by the critics and nominated as best story in the international comics convention in Angoul√™me. In 2007-2008 he wrote the science fiction trilogy The Chimpanzee Complex, with art by Jean-Michel Ponzio which received a public success. Other series by Marazano include the fantasy adventures, \\"le monde de Milo\\", and the retro scifi \\"Les trois fant√¥mes de Tesla\\" both series which also received critical and public success in Europe. Other works noticeable work include \\"the expedition\\" with art by Marcelo Frusin, SAM With Shang Xiao which became a success in France and China) or Trelawney, with Spanish artist Alfonso Font, telling the story of the 19th- century corsair Edward John Trelawney. The sf-fantasy-thriller tetralogy Le Protocole P√©lican (The Pelican Protocol), published in 2011-2013, also featured art by Ponzio. In 2014 he has been following painting teaching by American Painter Max Ginsburg at the Art Student League in New-York.

May 2000. http://www.bayjournal.com/article.cfm?article=1867 . 11/11/08. The theory is based on the concept of dynamic equilibrium in which streamforms balance between physical parameters, such as width, depth, velocity, and sediment load, also taking into account biological factors.‚ÄúRiver Continuum‚Äù Stroud Water Research Center. 2002-2005. 11/11/08. It offers an introduction to map out biological communities and also an explanation for their sequence in individual sections of water. This allows the structure of the river to be more predictable as to the biological properties of the water. The concept was first developed in 1980 by Robin L. Vannote, with fellow researchers at the Stroud Water Research Center.‚ÄúRiver Continuum‚Äù Stroud Water Research Center. 2002-2005. 11/11/08.  Background of RCC  The River Continuum Concept is based on the idea that a watercourse is an open ecosystem that is in constant interaction with the bank, and moving from source to mouth, constantly changing.Gordon D.N., T.A. McMahon, B.L. Finlayson, C.J. Gippel, R.J. Nathan: ‚ÄúStream Hydrology - An Introduction for ECOLOGISTE‚Äù. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, W Suss 2004. Basis for this change in the overall system is due to the gradual change of physical environmental conditions such as the width, depth, water, flow characteristics, temperature, and the complexity of the water. According to Vannote's hypothesis, which is based on the physical geomorphological theory, structural and functional characteristics of stream communities are selected to conform to the most probable position or mean state of the physical system.Strahler, A. N. ‚ÄúHypsometric (area altitude) analysis of erosional topology‚Äù. Geological Society of America Bulletin, 63, 1117 - 1142. 1953. As a river changes from headwaters to the lower reaches, there will be a change in the relationship between the production and consumption (respiration) of the material (P/R ratio). The four scientists who collaborated with Dr. Vannote were Drs. G.Wayne Minshall (Idaho State University), Kenneth W. Cummins (Michigan State University), James R. Sedell (Oregon State University), and Colbert E. Cushing (Battelle-Pacific Northwest Laboratory). The group studied stream and river ecosystems in their respective geographical areas to support or disprove tenets of their original theory. The research resulted in the publication of 33 scientific papers (see attachment to Bibliography). The original 1980 paper received the John Martin Award from the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography (formerly the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography) that recognizes papers still relevant ten years after their publication. Subsequent research related to the RCC by these scientists has resulted in several more scientific papers that amplify parts of the original RCC.  Living communities and food types  The continuous differences of properties within the river are dependent primarily on the specific composition of the organisms in different sections of the water. Throughout the continuum of the river, the proportion of the four major food types; shredders, collectors, grazers (scrapers) and predators change. With the exception of the predators, all these organisms feed directly from plant material (saprobes).Curry, R. ‚ÄúRivers: A Geomorphic and Chemical Overview‚Äù, p 9‚Äì31 in River Ecology. Academic Press, NY. 1972. =Shredders= Shredders are organisms that feed off of coarse particulate organic material (CPOM) such as small sections of leaves. They ingest the organic matter along with volunteer organisms (fungi, microorganisms) attached to the source. The preferred size of the CPOM is about one millimeter, therefore shredders must break it up into a finer particulate. In the process of shredding, much of the now finer organic matter is left in the system, making its way further downstream.Thorp J.H. , Delong M.D.: ‚ÄúThe Riverine Productivity Model: An Heuristic View of Carbon Sources and organic processing in large river ecosystems‚Äù. In: Oikos 70 (2) :305-308. Blackwell, Oxford 70 .1994. Some common shredders of North American waters include the Mayfly (Ephemeroptera), Odonata (damselflies) and stone fly (Plecoptera) larvae, whereas decapods (particularly Atyid shrimp) fulfill the same role in tropical environments. =Collectors= Collector organisms are designated by their use of traps or other adaptive features to filter and catch organic matter. The preferred particle size for collectors lies between 0.5 and 50 micrometers (UPOM = Ultrafine particulate organic matter and FPOM = fine particulate organic matter). This group includes fly larvae, nematodes, and many other animal groups.Thorp J.H. , Delong M.D.: ‚ÄúThe Riverine Productivity Model: An Heuristic View of Carbon Sources and organic processing in large river ecosystems‚Äù. In: Oikos 70 (2) :305-308. Blackwell, Oxford 70 .1994. =Grazers= The grazers (scrapers) feed off of periphyton that accumulates on larger structures such as stones, wood or large aquatic plants. These include snails, caddisflies (Glossosoma genus), and other organisms.Thorp J.H. , Delong M.D.: ‚ÄúThe Riverine Productivity Model: An Heuristic View of Carbon Sources and organic processing in large river ecosystems‚Äù. In: Oikos 70 (2) :305-308. Blackwell, Oxford 70 .1994. Because of the structure of organic matter at different sections in a river, the make up and frequency of these groups in a community vary. In the upper reaches of a river, shredders and collectors make up a large percentage of total macroinvertebrates due to the excess presence of coarse plant matter. In the midreaches of a stream or river, where more light is available, there is an increase in the proportion of grazers due to the presence of periphyton. Shredders only make up a small percentage of the total invertebrates due to the lack of coarse organic matter making its way downstream. In the lower reaches, organic matter has been shredded completely to the level of FPOM or UPOM (Ultra-fine Particulate Organic Matter). Due to the increase in fine particulate organic matter, collectors are the most abundant in the lower reaches, feeding off organic matter and surface films. The proportion of predators in all sections remains largely constant and only changes in species composition. The reason for the even distribution is that predators are not dependent on the size of the organic matter but on the availability of prey animals in the area.Thorp J.H. , Delong M.D.: ‚ÄúThe Riverine Productivity Model: An Heuristic View of Carbon Sources and organic processing in large river ecosystems‚Äù. In: Oikos 70 (2) :305-308. Blackwell, Oxford 70 .1994. Atypical changes in the composition of these groups of organisms within a watercourse, such as an increased number of choppers in a major river area (mid to lower reach) or a lack of these organisms in the upper reaches, suggest a possible disturbance.Strahler, A. N. ‚ÄúHypsometric (area altitude) analysis of erosional topology‚Äù. Geological Society of America Bulletin, 63, 1117 - 1142. 1953.  Division of the riverine  The River Continuum Concept assigns different sections of a river into three rough classifications. These classifications apply to all river waters, from small streams to medium-sized and large rivers. =Headwaters (Stream order 1 to 3)= The creek area in the upper reaches or headwaters of a water system is usually very narrow and lined by thick shore vegetation. This prevents the penetration of sunlight, in turn decreasing the production of organic material through photosynthesis in the water. The majority of the organic matter that does make its way into the system is in the form allochthonous plant material that falls into the river, such as leaves and sticks. In this section, respiration (consumption) out paces production (P/R<1). Here shredders play a major role in breaking down coarse plant material. In this area, the largest diversity of organic material can be expected.Stout III, Ben M. \\"River Continuum Concept as an Analytical Template for Assessing Watershed Health\\" Wheeling Jesuit University. 2003. =Midreaches (Stream order 4-6)= In the midreaches of a river, river structures such as rocks and trees play an important role as a supplier of organic material such as periphyton and other autochthonous organic materials. The photosynthesis to respiration ratio is larger in this section and amounts to P: R> 1. The percentage of shredders in this area is less than that of the headwaters, due to lack of coarse plant particulate. Collectors and grazers make up a majority of the macro invertebrate structure in this area, with the predator's share remaining unchanged.Stout III, Ben M. \\"River Continuum Concept as an Analytical Template for Assessing Watershed Health\\" Wheeling Jesuit University. 2003. =Lower reaches (Stream order >6)= In the lower reaches, there is a large flux in particulate material and also a decrease in production through photosynthesis, due to an increase in water cloudiness (turbidity) and surface film from suspended FPOM. Here, like the headwaters, respiration outpaces photosynthesis, making the ratio again less than 1 (P: R <1). The living community in these areas are made up of almost exclusively collectors, as well as a small share of predators.Stout III, Ben M. \\"River Continuum Concept as Analytical Template for Assessing Watershed Health\\" Wheeling Jesuit University. 2003.  Contributing factors  The continuous changes down the water route are due to various factors. As described above, at its beginning, the river is very strongly influenced by material from outside the system, especially organic material which is consumed by various macroinvertebrates (mainly shredders). As you go further down the system there is an increase in autochthonous (i.e., within the system) production of organic material such as periphyton. The extent of this production varies depending on the amount of sunlight present. The last area is less dependent on the outside but still very much influenced by the degradation processes. In a continuous system without interference, such as by inflows, this development is possible in all river systems, with some variations occurring due to seasonal changes and other environmental factors (especially temperature).Gordon D.N., T.A. McMahon, B.L. Finlayson, C.J. Gippel, R.J. Nathan: ‚ÄúStream Hydrology - An Introduction for ECOLOGISTE‚Äù. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, W Suss 2004.  Resources and stability of the system  At any point in the system when organic material is added, it is used or stored, with a small proportion making its way further downstream. The existing energy is the limiting growth factor of the system, therefore the system is striving to be as efficient as possible. Free resources will enable new types of life in the community to establish, so that the excess resources are quickly exploited. This principle is not exclusively for river ecosystems but applies to most systems. Here, however, it plays a larger role, because resources are not spent in one place but are being constantly transported downstream.Thorp J.H. , Delong M.D.: ‚ÄúThe Riverine Productivity Model: An Heuristic View of Carbon Sources and organic processing in large river ecosystems‚Äù. In: Oikos 70 (2) :305-308. Blackwell, Oxford 70 .1994. The temporal aspect of this continuity can be seen by its daily and seasonal changes. In the course of a day there are many changes in the structure of living communities, mainly due to increased resource pressure during the day (better rate of detection) and abiotic factors such as changes of temperature and light. The midreaches are the most affected by daily periodic changes, because here there is the greatest biodiversity, each with different ideal conditions.Thorp J.H. , Delong M.D.: ‚ÄúThe Riverine Productivity Model: An Heuristic View of Carbon Sources and organic processing in large river ecosystems‚Äù. In: Oikos 70 (2) :305-308. Blackwell, Oxford 70 .1994. Because there is a uniform use of resources and high stability, disturbances and fluctuations are usually corrected relatively quickly. Inequalities in the use of resources will be quickly compensated for, creating a new equilibrium. Also, there is no ecological development of the system (succession) and changes in the system are a result of outside geological changes, such as a change in the level of water making its way into the system, change of organic inputs or earthquakes. Even after these changes, however, it returns to a steady and modified equilibrium. This ensures that the ecosystem stays as an optimal functioning river system.Thorp J.H. , Delong M.D.: ‚ÄúThe Riverine Productivity Model: An Heuristic View of Carbon Sources and organic processing in large river ecosystems‚Äù. In: Oikos 70 (2) :305-308. Blackwell, Oxford 70 .1994.  Development and application of the concept  The first comprehensive presentation of the 1980 concept was part of a two-day conference at Stroud Water Research Center, whose head director was Robin Vannote. It was the result of a multi-year study conducted by the Rockefeller Foundation. The publication of the hypothesis was released later that same year under the title \\"The River Continuum Concept\\" in the Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences.‚ÄúRiver Continuum‚Äù Stroud Water Research Center. 2002-2005. 11/11/08. The concept built on the work of other American limnologists such as Ruth Patrick, from which the modern riverine ecosystem model has emerged, and Luna Leopold, which deals with the physical changes of water.Vannote R.L., G. W. Minshall, K. W. Cummins,Can. J. ‚ÄúRiver Continuum Concept‚Äù Fish. Aquatic Science. March 2005. The essential goal of the concept was to further assess and explain the various communities in the system. Vannote himself described the current situation as follows, \\"in those days, most people studied a square meter of water to death Vannote R.L. , G.W. MINSHALL, K.W. Cummins, J.R. Sedell, C.E. Cushing: ‚ÄúThe River Continuum Concept‚Äù. Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences. 37.1980,1 Ottawa, 130-137.‚Äù. Meaning that previous research was always only on small pieces of water and only rarely was the entire river system considered, allowing for the creation of a general model. After its publication, the River Continuum Concept was adopted as the accepted model in the limnology community, becoming a favorite means for describing the communities living in flowing water. Here it broke the classic idea of riverine structure. Previous approaches had their disadvantages because they only described small zones of water and had no consideration for the system in its entirety.‚ÄúRiver Continuum‚Äù Stroud Water Research Center. 2002-2005. 11/11/08. In practice, the River Continuum Concept is used today mainly for environmental assessment of rivers. River studies that assess riverine biological communities and have determined the species composition of an area can then be compared with the ideal species composition from the River Continuum Concept. From there, any variations in species composition may shed light on disturbances that might be occurring to offset the system.Stout III, Ben M. \\"River Continuum Concept as an Analytical Template for Assessing Watershed Health\\" Wheeling Jesuit University. 2003.  Problems, limitations and modifications  Although the River Continuum Concept is a broadly accepted theory, it is limited in its applicability. It describes a perfect and even model without taking into account changing riverine disturbances and irregularities. Disturbances such as congestion by dams or natural events such as shore flooding are not included in the model.Junk J.W., P.B. Bayley, R.E. Sparks: ‚ÄúThe flood pulse concept in river flood plain systems‚Äù. Canadian Special Publications of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences. 106. 1989. Various researchers have since expanded the River Continuum Concept to account for such irregularities. For example, J.V. Ward and J.A. Stanford came up with the Serial Discontinuity Concept in 1983, which addresses the impact of geomorphologic disorders such as congestion and integrated inflows. The same authors presented the Hyporheic Corridor concept in 1993, in which the vertical (in depth) and lateral (from shore to shore) structural complexity of the river were connected.Ward J.V., J.A. Stanford: The Serial Discontinuity Concept of River Ecosystems. T.D. Fontaine, S.M. Bartell: ‚ÄúDynamics of Lotic Ecosystems‚Äù. Science Publications, Ann Arbor Mich 29-42. 1983. The flood pulse concept, developed by W.J. Junk in 1989, further modified by P.B. Bayley in 1990 and K. Tockner in 2000, takes into account the large amount of nutrients and organic material that makes its way into a river from the sediment of surrounding flooded land.Junk J.W., P.B. Bayley, R.E. Sparks: ‚ÄúThe flood pulse concept in river flood plain systems‚Äù. Canadian Special Publications of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences. 106. 1989.

Early life and military career Muter was born in Madison County, Virginia (then a part of Orange County).Faust, p. 378 He was the son of a German father and a Scottish mother. Little is known of his early life. During the Revolutionary War, Muter served as Virginia's Commissioner of the War Office. In March 1781, Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben charged that Muter was responsible for inadequate availability of weapons and ammunition in the state. Muter learned of the charges before von Steuben brought them before the House of Burgesses and asked Governor Thomas Jefferson for a full investigation to clear his name. Jefferson expressed confidence in Muter, but the March 20 report of a special committee appointed by the House of Burgesses charged that Muter was not qualified to fill the position and ought to be removed from office. Muter resigned two days after the report was delivered.Ammunition Supply In Revolutionary Virginia Thomas Speed also records that he was commander aboard a ship of war and attained the rank of colonel.Speed, p. 48 Relocation to Kentucky It is likely that Muter came to Kentucky in 1784.Whitsett, p. 109 The Virginia legislature had appointed him to the district court of Kentucky in 1783, but did not assume the post until 1785.Levin, p. 62 The court first convened in Harrodsburg, but was moved to Danville in 1783. On November 15, Muter succeeded Cyrus Griffin as chief justice of the court. Muter was a member of the German Reformed Church in Lexington, Kentucky.Faust, p. 379 He was also the first president of the Caledonian Society, a nod to his Scottish heritage on his mother's side. He was one of the first trustees of Transylvania Seminary, which would eventually merge with Kentucky University to become Transylvania University. He was also named a trustee of the city of Danville in 1787.Speed, p. 167 In 1786, Muter was invited to become a member of the Danville Political Club, a debating society that also included Samuel McDowell and Harry Innes.Speed, p. 101 He was accepted as a member on the motion of John Belli on February 17, 1787; the vote was unanimous.Speed, pp. 118, 121 An undated note in the Club's records show that, even after Muter removed from Danville, the Club retained him as a member.Speed, p. 75 From 1785 to 1792, Muter was a delegate to all ten conventions called for the purpose of framing the first Kentucky Constitution. In 1785, he and Harry Innes were chosen to carry a petition for statehood to the Virginia legislature. When Kentucky achieved statehood in 1792, Muter was chosen as an elector to choose the state's governor and senators.Speed, p. 49 The district court for Kentucky district was dissolved, and the Kentucky Court of Appeals was organized to replace it as the first court of last resort for the state. Muter's fellow district court judges, Caleb Wallace and Benjamin Sebastian, were immediately elevated to the court, but attorney general Harry Innes was elevated to chief justice instead of Muter.Whitsett, p. 136 However, Innes was chosen by President George Washington as chief justice of the new U.S. district court for Kentucky; Innes immediately resigned to accept this position. The legislature chose Muter to replace Innes, who never presided over the court. Muter presided over a meeting held in Lexington on May 24, 1794 for the purpose of addressing trade on the Mississippi River. The delegates to the meeting concluded that it was the duty of the United States Congress to secure free trade on the Mississippi from the Spanish, even if it meant the use of force. In 1795, Muter and Sebastian rendered a decision against Kentucky pioneer Simon Kenton in a land title case.Whitsett, p. 137 The decision was very unpopular with the people of Kentucky, and in December 1795, they petitioned the legislature to remove the two justices.Whitsett, p. 138 The legislature failed to produce the two-thirds majority needed to remove the justices, but they were sternly rebuked. In May 1796, Muter joined with Caleb Wallace to express an opinion opposite his unpopular decision in October. In 1806, Muter was pressured to retire from the bench, which he did on the condition that he would be paid a pension of three hundred dollars per year.Whitsett, p. 139 The next legislature, however, repealed the pension. Governor Christopher Greenup, a past associate of Muter's, vetoed the repeal, but his veto was overridden.Speed, pp. 49-50 Because Muter had no family, his friend and fellow justice Thomas Todd invited Muter to live with him.Speed, p. 50 In Muter's will, he left his entire estate to Todd.

The film is set in the director's home city of Chongqing. Produced by China Vision Group and Eagle Spirit Management, Curiosity Kills the Cat stars Hu Jun, Liao Fan, as well as veteran Hong Kong actress Carina Lau. Though primarily a mainland Chinese production, international sales was handled by Hong Kong-based Golden Network. Lau would win a Best Actress Golden Rooster Award for her work in the film. Curiosity Kills the Cat was to some critics, most notably Variety's Derek Elley, a prime example of the kind of popular but well-crafted entertainment that China's film industry had begun to produce.  Plot  Curiosity Kills the Cat tells the same story of an affair gone sour in a modern Chinese city (in this case, Chongqing) from four separate perspectives. In the first part of the film, the story is told from the point of view of a young woman, Momo (Lin Yuan), who works in a photography store located in the same building as a luxury apartment complex. Momo has begun to secretly observe (and take pictures with her camera phone) John Zheng (Hu Jun) as he carries on an affair with Sharon (Song Jia), the owner of a nearby nail salon. Momo also observes John's unhappily married wife Rose (Carina Lau), as she suffers attacks from an unknown vandal who dumps paint on her car and windows. In the film's second part, the story of John and Sharon is retold, this time from John's perspective and how he became involved with the younger woman. The story is retold once again in the film's third part, now from the perspective of a security guard (Liao Fan). In this part of the film, John and Rose's young child is kidnapped and a murder of one of the characters causes disarray to all the characters' lives.  Cast  * Carina Lau as Rose Feng (ÂçÉÁæΩ), John's unhappily married wife. * Hu Jun as John Zheng (ÈÉëÈáç), a middle- aged man married to Rose with a young child. The film's second act is from his perspective. * Song Jia as Sharon Liang (Ê¢ÅÊôìÈúû), a young woman who has opened a manicure business next to John and Rose's apartment complex; she is John's mistress. * Liao Fan as Liu Fendou (ÂàòÂ•ãÊñó), the security guard in John and Rose's apartment building. The film's third act is told from Liu's perspective. * Lin Yuan as Momo (ÈôåÈôå), a young woman who works in a camera shop, she has taken to observing the marital strife between her neighbors, John and Rose. The film's first act is from Momo's point of view.  Censorship  In a bizarre turn, during the film's development process, a technician confiscated several reels for fear that the film's sex scenes would never make it past the censors. The technician, an employee at the Beijing Film Developing and Printing & Video Laboratory, refused to print the film or return the negatives. Ten years earlier, the same lab technician had been punished by the China Film Bureau over a similar matter, reportedly leading him to be \\"a bit jumpy.\\" State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television (SARFT) officials eventually had to contact the lab \\"consenting\\" to the film's production. The process still required that the filmmakers institute a number of extensive cuts. The incident prompted the film's producer, Jimmy Wu to renew calls for a Chinese film rating system.  Oscar nomination bid  In late 2006, Curiosity Kills the Cat made a bid to become China's nomination for best foreign film in the Academy Awards. The decision to push the film by producer Jimmy Wu was seen as odd in comparison to the previous six Chinese films to be selected, all of which were historical epics or high-budget wuxia pictures (such as Zhang Yimou's Hero). Wu argued that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences had grown weary of the same historical films every year coming from China and that Curiosity's more realistic depiction of a modern China would appeal to judges. Despite the push, the nomination spot went to Zhang Yimou's historical epic Curse of the Golden Flower which was ultimately not selected to compete for the award. Wu, however, called for hearings suggesting that Curse violated Academy rules when its screening in China was switched, at the last moment, from Shenyang to Beijing.

It is surrounded by the Blue Mountains, and is drained by the Grande Ronde River. La Grande is its largest community. The valley is long, north to south, from Pumpkin Ridge to Pyles Canyon, and wide, east to west, from Cove to the Grande Ronde River's canyon. Its name, fittingly, means, \\"great circle.\\" Geology The lower Grande Ronde Valley. The Grande Ronde Valley is part of the Columbia River Plateau. The Columbia River Plateau was created by a series of basalt flood eruptions. These happen when a long crack in the Earth's crust spews floods of lava. The molten rock then hardens and creates layers of basalt. The Grande Ronde Valley floor began to sink from this plateau at a rate of about .07-.18 millimeters per year about nine million years ago. Geography The Grande Ronde Valley floor is at about above sea level. Its horizon is dominated by the Blue Mountains. Eagle Cap Wilderness is to the southeast. The highest nearby mountains are Mount Fanny to the east, with an elevation of ; Mount Harris to the northeast, elevation , and Mount Emily to the northwest, elevation . Communities within the valley include Cove, Imbler, Island City, La Grande, Summerville, and Union. The Grande Ronde River flows through the valley; its tributaries include Catherine, Fir, Ladd, Little, Mill, Pyles, and Willow creeks. History =Native Americans= Eastern Oregon and the surrounding area was a haven for many Native American tribes. Many of these tribes, including the Nez Perce, Cayuse, Umatilla, Walla Walla, and Shoshone, would spend their summers in the bountiful Grande Ronde Valley. Here they would forage, hunt, fish, and bathe in hot springs. Tribes that may have been hostile toward each other would live together harmoniously in the \\"Valley of Peace\\". =First contact and settlement= The Astor Expedition passed through the valley in 1811, and it was a waypoint along the Oregon Trail. Since the 1840s, settlers headed toward the Willamette Valley would pass through it. Every traveler who left a record of passing through the area was left with a favorable impression. Early pioneers chose not to settle in the valley, perhaps because they were intent upon reaching the Willamette Valley, it was too far from a supply base, or they feared the Native Americans in the area. The first permanent settlement in the Grande Ronde Valley was not established until 1861. The first permanent settler in the Grande Ronde Valley was Benjamin Brown, an Englishman who had originally settled in Michigan. Not long after, the Leasey family and about 20 others settled there. Serving as a travelers inn, the settlement was originally named Brown's Fort, and then Browns Town or Brownsville. Since there was already a Brownsville in Linn County, the name was changed to La Grande. =Growth= Early settlements were in the more arable northern parts of the valley, as the southern end was subject to flooding, swampy, and contained alkaline soil. In 1862, Conrad Miller settled the opposite side of the valley. This settlement grew into the city of Union, the second largest community in the Grande Ronde Valley. Island City, Cove, and Summerville were not far behind. Many factors contributed to the growth of the valley. Some of these were the continuing presence of emigrants from the Oregon Trail, and the discovery of gold mines in the surrounding area, including at Baker in 1861 and the Powder River Mines in 1862. The Grande Ronde Lake Campground Mormons were attracted to the valley after an 1889 business trip by David Eccles, Charles W. Nibley, and George Stoddard, who set up businesses in the area. Mormons followed and settled in the valley after then, and remained a prominent force until the Nibley-Stoddard mills were purchased or closed between 1920 and 1931. The influence of the Mormons in the area was limited, as all profits were sent to Utah, rather than staying with local businessmen. =Railroad= Many railroad efforts were begun, including the Grande Ronde and Walla Walla Railroad Company in 1872 by H. J. Mecham and James Hendershott, as well as an effort to connect to Dorsey S. Baker's Walla Walla and Columbia River Railroad. The Grande Ronde and Walla Walla route was to be long but was never completed, and the connection from Walla Walla to the Columbia River covered and took six years to complete. In 1878, several La Grande residents spearheaded an effort to build a railroad from La Grande to the Columbia River at Umatilla. They organized a company, called the Columbia River and Blue Mountain Railroad Company, and sent teams to Umatilla to begin grading. In 1879, the whole enterprise was surrendered to Henry Villard and his Oregon Railway and Navigation Company. The Oregon Railway and Navigation lines were to be joined to the Oregon Short Line and Union Pacific at Huntington, causing the valley to no longer be connected by difficult wagon roads. As one pioneer woman in the area wrote, \\"No more big, heavily loaded freight wagons with their wheels buried to the hub in mud.\\" Two routes were proposed to exit the valley eastward, one that would put the railroad close to Union, and one that would put it close to La Grande. Both towns wanted the railroad, so a competition developed with both towns trying to please the engineers sent to survey the routes. Eventually the La Grande route was chosen. The railroad was completed in 1884. The Oregon Railway and Navigation Company (OR&N;) built a spur line from La Grande to Elgin. When the spur was completed, La Grande citizens paid $7,000 to OR&N.; The first logging railroads in the valley were built in 1907 for the Hilgard Lumber Company and Mecham Lumber Company, both owned by Charles W. Nibley with partners J. F. Nibley and Merrill Nibley. These temporary lines were long. Transportation There are six ways to get in and out of the Grande Ronde Valley. *Old Oregon Trail Highway (North) (Interstate 84): This highway leaves on the west side of the valley through the Grande Ronde River canyon. It goes through the Blue Mountains toward Pendleton. * Old Oregon Trail Highway (South) (Interstate 84): Going this direction, the highway comes back out on the south end of the valley through Ladd Canyon. It passes into Powder Valley and continues toward Baker City. *Wallowa Lake Highway (Oregon Route 82): This highway exits on the other side of the Grande Ronde River canyon in the north and enters Indian Valley. It then continues and ends at Wallowa Lake. *La Grande-Baker Highway (Oregon Route 237): This highway exits the valley through Pyles Canyon. Past North Powder and Interstate 84, it turns into U.S. Route 30 and continues to Baker City. *Medical Springs Highway (Oregon Route 203): This highway leaves the valley through the canyon of Catherine Creek.

This is commonly contrasted with benefit incidence as an approach to planning and measuring the effect of a government spending programme. A pioneering analysis of this was made by the economist Richard Musgrave in his major work, The Theory of Public Finance. Establishing the differential effect of expenditure in this way is difficult because the effect of differing policies upon taxation and overall expenditure must be normalised and it is hard to model and measure the flows of money which result. An analysis will commonly be structured in three stages: #Definition of the government programmes or budgetary expenditures and the corresponding database of monetary values. #Determining the measures of income: the size of economic unit such as the individual, family or community; the timescale of analysis such as annual or lifetime; the well-being and externalities which arise from the expenditure. #The resulting effects upon income distribution as a result of the expenditure are then calculated.

It was later recognized to occur in vivo. The phenomenon is now resolved as a complement- dependent binding reaction of erythrocytes to microorganisms where specific antibodies are engaged in the process.Roitt IM, Brostoff J, Male D (1998). Immunology, 5th ed. London: Mosby, . The reaction process is as follows: any microorganisms are bound with their specific antibodies, if they are produced, which activate the classical pathway of the complement system. The cascade begins to work from C1 to C3b through C4b, C3b being further transformed to iC3b (inactive derivative of C3b), all of which, C4b and thereafter, remain to bind to the surface of the microbe. Because primate erythrocytes express complement receptor 1 (CR1) on their surface and having binding specificity to C4b, C3b, or iC3b, erythrocytes accumulate on the microbe via CR1-complement binding.Frank K, Atkinson JP (2001). \\"Complement system.\\" In Austen KF, Frank K, Atkinson JP, Cantor H. eds.

While the distribution used for the approximation might be a normal distribution, this is not always so and, for example a triangular distribution might be used, depending on the application. In three-point estimation, three figures are produced initially for every distribution that is required, based on prior experience or best-guesses: * a = the best-case estimate * m = the most likely estimate * b = the worst-case estimate These are then combined to yield either a full probability distribution, for later combination with distributions obtained similarly for other variables, or summary descriptors of the distribution, such as the mean, standard deviation or percentage points of the distribution. The accuracy attributed to the results derived can be no better than the accuracy inherent in the three initial points, and there are clear dangers in using an assumed form for an underlying distribution that itself has little basis. Estimation Based on the assumption that a PERT distribution governs the data, several estimates are possible. These values are used to calculate an E value for the estimate and a standard deviation (SD) as L-estimators, where: : E = (a + 4m + b) / 6 : SD = (b ‚àí a) / 6 E is a weighted average which takes into account both the most optimistic and most pessimistic estimates provided. SD measures the variability or uncertainty in the estimate. In Project Evaluation and Review Techniques (PERT) the three values are used to fit a PERT distribution for Monte Carlo simulations. The triangular distribution is also commonly used. It differs from the double-triangular by its simple triangular shape and by the property that the mode does not have to coincide with the median. The mean (expected value) is then: : E = (a + m + b) / 3. In some applications,Ministry of Defence (2007) \\"Three point estimates and quantitative risk analysis\\" Policy, information and guidance on the Risk Management aspects of UK MOD Defence Acquisition the triangular distribution is used directly as an estimated probability distribution, rather than for the derivation of estimated statistics. Project management To produce a project estimate the project manager: * Decomposes the project into a list of estimable tasks, i.e. a work breakdown structure * Estimates the expected value E(task) and the standard error SE(task) of this estimate for each task time * Calculates the expected value for the total project work time as \\\\operatorname{E}(\\\\text{project}) = \\\\sum{ \\\\operatorname{E}(\\\\text{task})} * Calculates the value SE(project) for the standard error of the estimated total project work time as: \\\\operatorname{SE}(\\\\text{project}) = \\\\sqrt{\\\\sum{\\\\operatorname{SE}(\\\\text{task})^2}} under the assumption that the project work time estimates are uncorrelated The E and SE values are then used to convert the project time estimates to confidence intervals as follows: * The 68% confidence interval for the true project work time is approximately E(project) ¬± SE(project) * The 90% confidence interval for the true project work time is approximately E(project) ¬± 1.645 √ó SE(project) * The 95% confidence interval for the true project work time is approximately E(project) ¬± 2 √ó SE(project) * The 99.7% confidence interval for the true project work time is approximately E(project) ¬± 3 √ó SE(project) * Information Systems typically uses the 95% confidence interval for all project and task estimates.68-95-99.7 rule These confidence interval estimates assume that the data from all of the tasks combine to be approximately normal (see asymptotic normality).

It consists of a grand meeting hall constructed in 1887, extended and renovated in 1996, providing a large upper hall, the lower hall as home to RMIT Gallery First Site, and a range of lecture theatres and semiar rooms. The 19th century hall was built by the Ancient Order of Hibernians, and known as Hibernian Hall. In the early 20th century it was put to a range of uses, until it was acquired by RMIT in 1957RMIT University - Storey Hall The hall was named after the Storey family; John Storey (Junior), who founded the RMIT Student Union in 1944, and Sir John Storey (Senior), who left a large bequest to RMIT in order to found the John Storey Junior Memorial Scholarships in memory of his son, whose studies were cut short in 1947 when he died of leukaemia at age 22.John Storey, RMIT University, Accessed 17 November 2008 A major refurbishment and addition was completed in 1996 to the design of Ashton Raggatt McDougall. The design of the new works is colourful and angular, employing Penrose tiles to create the patterned facade and the refurbished interior of the original auditorium. The ground level of the original hall houses the RMIT First Site Gallery, which is operated by the RMIT Union, and has a focus on new media, as well as a cafe named re:vault.Launch (RMIT Union) - Exhibition Spaces Architecture One of the key influences in the design of the Storey Hall annex is the use of Penrose‚Äôs tiling pattern, developed by Roger Penrose. The street fa√ßade is a version of the historic hall next door, its basic shapes of arch below and window above transformed by applying the Penrose pattern. The precast Penrose patterned tiles incorporate the impression of ruffles, keys and suspender belts to represent the Suffragettes, who once occupied used the original hall. The colours of purple and green also reflect those of the women's liberation movement, with the green, used more extensively inside, referring to the Hibernian Hall‚Äôs construction by the Irish community of Melbourne. The foyer contains off-form concrete walls and columns with a curved stairwell. The main auditorium‚Äôs ceiling and large areas of wall are composed of geometric Penrose tile patterns in green and white. Storey Hall is both architecturally and historically significant as it has won numerous awards and combines both the historical and traditional aspects of the former Hibernian Hall to create a complex and daring building. Storey Hall could be said to represent the Deconstructivism strain of postmodern architecture, and contrasts for instance with the more ordered and facade of RMIT Building 8 on the other side of Storey Hall. The Storey Hall refurbishment was one of the first buildings in Melbourne to use computer and digital fabrication, necessary to produce the complex yet mathematical elements of the architecture.

The building was opened in 1962 as the T & G Building, and was the tallest building in Perth until 1970 when Hamersley House was opened. It underwent a major refurbishment in the 1980s which significantly altered the building's external features. The building adopted its current name when Citibank became its flagship tenant. As of December 2008, the tower is the 26th-tallest completed building in Perth.  Site history and construction  The site at the corner of St Georges Terrace and Barrack Street was occupied by hostelries from the colony's earliest days, and later housed the Weld Club. During the Western Australian gold rush in 1897, the Moir Building was constructed on the site. Designed by Talbot Hobbs, the building was one of the most well-known buildings in Perth at the time. It later became the headquarters for the T & G Mutual Life Assurance Society and was renamed to the T & G Chambers. The southern end of the site was also home to the McNeil Chambers.Progress Bulletin No. 13, 1 February 1962 = New T & G Building = Growth in T & G's business, coupled with a desire for a modern tower, led to the decision to demolish the iconic chambers. The original T & G Chambers were demolished in early 1960, and excavation for the new tower's foundation began in June 1960. The high water table of the site necessitated the use of a raft-type foundation. The thick foundation was formed by the pour of of concrete in one continuous pour,Progress Bulletin No. 2, 20 September 1960. which occurred on 25 September 1960.Progress Bulletin No. 3, 20 October 1960. After this, a concrete retaining wall was poured around the basement levels and the steel frame of the building was erected. The floors of the building were formed by attaching permanent galvanised iron formwork to the steel frame, adding steel reinforcement mesh and pouring of concrete on top.Progress Bulletin No. 5, 27 January 1961 The building was the tallest in Perth upon its completion.  Design  The T&G; Building was designed by architects Forbes & Fitzhardinge.Progress Bulletin No. 1, 20 August 1960. The service tower on the building's west side housed the tower's services, including its four high- speed lifts, a lift lobby, electricity, plumbing, toilets, tea room and two escape stairwells. The containment of the services within the service tower enabled the of office space on each floor to be contiguous. The service tower rose above the roof of the main building. The building is of a steel frame construction, clad with aluminium, glass and precast aggregate concrete panels. The building is supported by 32 steel columns.Progress Bulletin No. 4, 1 December 1960 The ground floor was clad with black polished granite, and the lobby featured Travertine marble. The office floors had external sun shades thick protruding from the side of the building to reduce the heat load of the building during summer.Progress Bulletin No. 7, 10 April 1961 The \\"fully automatic\\" lifts which were installed in the building were the most advanced in Australia.Progress Bulletin No. 12, 17 November 1961 A steel flag pole (incorporating a lightning conductor) was placed on the northern end of the service tower.  Refurbishment  When the T & G Building was constructed, there were no plot ratio limits imposed by the City of Perth on multistorey developments, and the building had a plot ratio of approximately 7:1. However, subsequent to the construction, a limit of 5:1 was imposed. As a result, in the 1980s when the tower was already outdated and showing signs of age, the owners found that they would be unable to replace the tower with a new one of a similar size. As a result, a decision was made to extensively refurbish the building. The roof of the building, which previously featured a small caretaker's flat, was fully enclosed as an extra office floor. Above this, a facade was added bringing all sides of the building to the top of the mechanical penthouse which previously rose several floors above the roof. The window shades above every floor were enlarged and extended outwards from the building, and all window glass was replaced.

Miller"},{"id":"20622754","text":"Dragon Quest X is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed and published by Square Enix. It is the tenth mainline entry in the Dragon Quest series. It was originally released for the Wii in 2012, and was later ported for Wii U, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Android, iOS, and Nintendo 3DS, all of which support cross-platform play. Outside of a discontinued Windows version in Chinese, the game was not localized outside of Japan. Dragon Quest X is set in the world of Astoltia, with the player character being initially human before an attack by the Lord of Hell Nelgel forces their soul into the body of another race. Following this, they must gather magical gems to seal Nelgel once again, while the player character's sibling is sent back in time to be safe from Nelgel. Gameplay follows a combination of elements from the Dragon Quest and other contemporary MMORPGs, such as real-time combat in an open world environment and a job system tied to skills and abilities. Concepts for an MMORPG within the Dragon Quest series began among a small team during the later development of Dragon Quest VIII. Development progressed alongside that of Dragon Quest IX. The aim was to make it accessible to series fans and newcomers alike, along with creating a long-term content plan. The development team featured multiple series veterans, including director Jin Fujisawa, series creator and designer Yuji Horii, series artist Akira Toriyama, and series composer Koichi Sugiyama. New staff members included producer Yosuke Saito, who had previously worked on the Drakengard series and whose company Orca helped with development; and Chikara Saito, who joined took over as director in 2013. Dragon Quest X was teased in 2008, with its full reveal as an MMORPG in 2011. Critical reception to the game have been generally positive, with praise going to its integrating of Dragon Quest features into an MMORPG structure. The game has since received several expansion packs and other updates. By 2014, the game had sold over one million copies across all versions.  Gameplay  Dragon Quest X is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), where a customized player character travels the world of Astoltia completing quests and fighting monsters. While starting out as a human character, the player character is later transferred into the body of one of five available tribes: the powerful Ogre, the inquisitive Puklipo, the aquatic Weddie, the forest-dwelling Elves, and the mining Dwarfs. Humans populate multiple settlements across Astoltia. Later versions added an additional Dragon race. The game utilizes cloud storage for save files and other game data. As with most MMORPGs, Dragon Quest X requires a subscription fee to access, however there is a daily two-hour window dubbed \\"Kid's Time\\" where players can access and play the game free of charge. Combat in Dragon Quest X, with the player character and current partners fighting an enemy in the battle arena Battles are triggered when the player encounters an enemy in the overworld. Battles take place in a themed arena, using a version of the Active Time Battle system: each side is given a turn in which to perform an action such as attacking. Each side can also interrupt an opponent's action, prolonging their waiting time. At the end of battle, players are granted experience points, which raise their experience level and boost their maximum health and statistics, in addition to in-game currency. Players can form a three-strong party to fight monsters, explore and battle alone, or loan non-active player characters of a similar or lower experience level for a fee, which are then controlled in battle by the game's artificial intelligence. Any character can be loaned to three different people, and the loaned character keeps the experience points and gold that they have earned. Player characters' combat abilities and skills are dictated by a character class-based job system. The jobs in the initial launch were Warrior, Priest, Mage, Martial Artist, Thief, and Minstrel. Later updates added further jobs, such as the Beast Tamer and Dancer. Each job has a separate skill point system that allows customization, and jobs can be changed at dedicated temples found in each major town. Player characters can also adopt Trades, skills that include woodwork, weapon and armor forging among others. Each Trade skill requires materials gathered from the overworld, which are then used to create a specific type of equipment unique to the gathered materials and Trade. Weapons and items are acquired either in battle alongside in-game currency or through Guilds scattered through Bazaars located in major towns. Guilds will forge new gear, weapons and items for a combined fee of money and materials salvaged from the game world. Also found in towns are vendors where excess items can be stored, merchants which buy and sell various items, and tailor's establishments where the player character can gain new outfits.  Synopsis  The story begins in the village of Etene, focusing on the protagonist, an orphan living with their sibling. The peace is shattered when Nelgel, the Lord of Hell, attacks the village. The protagonist's soul is transported to a shrine and placed within the body of a member of the five non-human tribes, while their sibling is transported to the past to protect her from Nelgel. Under the guidance of a sage, the protagonist travels to Astoltia searching for sacred emblems with which to reach Nelgel's lair. After collecting six out of ten emblems, the sage attempts to form a bridge to Nelgel's laier. This fails, and he decides to separate the protagonist's soul from their body in a desperate attempt to try another method. This proves to be successful, as the protagonist then meets the body's original owner. The protagonist's mission is made clear when they realize that a sacred vessel called the Ark of the Heavens is the only thing that can penetrate Nelgel's defenses. The protagonist then travels 500 years into the past, where the Ark of the Heavens was last used in recorded history. After fighting Razban, a demon bent on bringing Nelgel to life, the protagonist forges a friendship with a young boy who knew the secret to using the Ark of the Heavens. Returning to the present, the protagonist entered Nelgel's lair, and after a long battle, emerged successful. During the end credits, the protagonist is greeted by the sage from before, who informs them that despite Nelgel's defeat, the seal he had on the central continent was still active. In the second expansion, the protagonist travels to Rendashia, the central continent of Astoltia where Nelgel's seal was created. The protagonist investigates the demonic events there and continues to work towards stopping Nelgel for good. In the third expansion, the protagonist becomes embroiled in a royal power struggle, at the same time as a massive monster invasion of Astoltia, controlled by a mysterious hooded man.  Development  Dragon Quest X was developed by Square Enix. This was the first modern Dragon Quest title to be developed by Square Enix, as earlier mainline entries had been handled by external companies. The CGI opening was handled by Square Enix's CGI department Visual Works. The game was directed by Jin Fujisawa, who also directed Dragon Quest IX. The scenario was written by Fujisawa, with later scenario support by Atsushi Narita. Horii served as game designer and general project director. Series art designer Akira Toriyama returned to design the characters, while the music was composed by series veteran Koichi Sugiyama. One of the chief planners was Naoki Yoshida, who had worked on earlier Dragon Quest spin-offs, and was later assigned as the director of Final Fantasy XIV and its reboot A Realm Reborn. A newcomer to the series was producer Yosuke Saito, who worked as a executive producer on the Drakengard series before producing its spin-off game Nier. After Cavia closed in 2010, Saito formed his own company Orca, which was chosen by Square Enix to support the development of Dragon Quest X. Due to this, work had to be scrapped on a PlayStation Vita version of Nier. Saito had earlier worked with MMORPGs when he was involved with the development of Cross Gate (2001). A second newcomer was Chikara Saito who, after working on Dragon Quest X during its development alongside Cross Treasures, would take over as the game's director in 2013. When speaking about why an online game was chosen as the next step in the series, Fujisawa cited the intuitive character AI in Dragon Quest IV and party member communication in Dragon Quest VII. Solid ideas for an online game set within the Dragon Quest series were first suggested in 2005, when development was wrapping up on Dragon Quest VIII. It was initially worked on by a very small team, who worked together on the groundwork for some time. A core part of the initial plan was that the game would have a pre- planned ten-year lifespan with continual content updates. Once work had finished on Dragon Quest IX, Dragon Quest X took full priority. During these earlier phases, it was still undecided whether to make the game a mainline title, and there was even doubt as to whether it could be an MMORPG rather than just an online multiplayer game. These doubts, held by Saito, were assuaged by Fujisawa's confidence in the project. Despite this, Fujisawa was a novice at both developing and playing MMORPGs, putting him in stark contrast with other staff members such as Saito, Yoshida and second chief planner Takashi Anzai. The change to a new genre presented multiple challenges to the team: while standard RPGs were designed around a scripted experience, MMORPGs were more reliant on a true sense of unscripted adventure. A major disadvantage was that Fujisawa was inexperienced with working on MMORPGs. The first major developmental issue was the need in an MMORPG to have a full customizable character. Another related problem was the initial premise of an unseen force as the threat, which was unusual within the form. Fujisawa rationalized it into a kind of \\"common sense\\" related to the interaction between player community and necessary events within the game world that worked against accepted principles of MMORPG gameplay, which resulted in multiple staff members raising doubts as to whether the game could work. The second major issue was what types of environments to include or discard, and for this Fujisawa was prepared due to his long experience with the franchise. On top of this, the staff needed to evaluate what would work for an MMORPG in the unpredictable Japanese gaming market, which unlike other parts of the world was not a major consumer of MMORPGs. Their main object for comparison was World of Warcraft, which by that time had 12 million players worldwide but only had a small holding in Japan. While this appeared discouraging, there had not been many titles of similar scale and success within the country, so there was both space for and detractions against an equivalent MMORPG experience. During this evaluation process, three key constraints were pinned down for the developers to face. The first was hardware related, as the Wii had a limited lifespan as a viable console; the second was the requirement of a subscription, a necessity to make the game profitable; and the third was a natural reticence against playing an online-only title. The Wii had been chosen as the game's platform due to its large install base and popularity in Japan, but it would inevitably be left behind for newer consoles, so it was decided to create future versions of Dragon Quest X for other viable platforms. To combat the monetary concerns, the team looked at the typical flat rate subscription, which at the time was between ¬•1200 (US$12) and ¬•2000 (US$20), then set it at ¬•1000 (US$10) so it would be attractive to more casual gamers while still being profitable. Despite the low fee, Fujisawa felt that this might turn away long-term fans who were not hardcore gamers. The solution was \\"Kid's Time\\", which despite the name was intended as a means for people of all ages to have free access to the game. Regardless of its online approach, the opening of the game was designed as an offline introductory experience. This caused technical issues for the developers: online game processing was divided between online servers and the hardware, while the opening relied entirely on the hardware, resulting in slowdown issues that needed addressing. \\"Kid's Time\\" offered a solution to the third constraint. The game made use of Square Enix's Crystal Tools game engine, making it the only Square Enix game outside the Final Fantasy series to make use of it. Cloud saves were used in place of USB storage as that would have taken up too much space on the Wii hardware and made it potentially impossible for players to store either saves or other downloaded games. The gameplay was intended to stay true to the Dragon Quest formula within the design necessities and limitations of an MMORPG. During an earlier development phase, the UI featured a large amount of information showing the various player statuses, but seeking to streamline and simplify the game, they removed most of the display. A different gameplay challenge was presented by the move from turn-based to real-time battles, which went against the traditions of the Dragon Quest series. Fujisawa wanted to implement the classic battle system, but was opposed by Horii and other staff members, who successfully pushed for a real-time combat system. Elements of that battle system, such as the ability to halt enemy momentum as a battle mechanic, proved extremely challenging for the developers. Speaking about the difference between Dragon Quest X and Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn, Yoshida said that they needed to preserve the atmosphere of a normal Dragon Quest title despite MMORPGs not being designed for solo playing. It was for this reason that the loaning of player characters as NPC party members was incorporated. During later development, and following the game's release, the main focus was on balancing the various elements, items and weapons so as to create a level playing field, in addition to keeping the in-game economy balanced. Several features featured in earlier entries, such as the Casino and Coliseum, needed to be kept back for a later time. The scenario was based around the concept of five different races, and the interaction with a human character. The story premise of a human character becoming a member of one of the five playable races was born out of a compromise about who and what the player character should be. The concept of a non-human character was introduced by Horii as he saw an inherent contradiction in the idea of a human saving the other tribes. This raised some contention among the staff including Fujisawa due to the Dragon Quest series' established convention of a human as the main protagonist, but Fujisawa and Horii decided to have the player character be a human first and later become one of the five tribes. Part of the story's initial drama came from the player character growing accustomed to their new form. Once the basic scenario concept had been finalized, the team commissioned the various character designs from Toriyama. In contrast to the greater majority of MMORPGs, which did not seem to have a solid ending, the team wanted to create a definitive ending with a final boss as featured in normal RPGs.  Release  Dragon Quest X was first hinted at during a Square Enix press conference in December 2008 when Horii revealed that the game was being developed for the Wii. The game's year of release, status as an MMORPG, and its eventual release on Wii U were announced in September 2011. Applications for the beta test opened in November 2011, with the beta beginning on February 23 the following year. Beta testers received a beta disk, USB memory stick and gameplay manual. The beta environment gave players access to multiple bosses and a limited amount of the early story. The original version released on August 2, 2012 for Wii. In addition to the standard release, a Wii bundle was released. A supplementary app for the Nintendo 3DS, with functions connected to both the 3DS functions in in-game messaging, released for free on August 22. Following the initial release, Square Enix doubled the amount of active servers to cope with crowding issues, while they worked on creating a larger permanent server increase. Support for the Wii version ended in 2017. The Wii U version released on March 30, 2013. The beta test began on March 5. A port for Microsoft Windows was released on September 26. Ports to both the PlayStation 4 (PS4) and Nintendo Switch were announced as being in development in August 2016. These ports will both be released in 2017; the PS4 version will release on August 17, and the Switch version on September 21, 2017. With the announcement of the Switch version, Square Enix offered players the option of switching their characters and progress to the Switch version. In addition to the standard home console releases, versions for portable and mobile platforms have been released that rely on cloud streaming, needing an internet connection to function. A version for Android and iOS was co-developed by Square Enix with NTT DoCoMo and Ubitus: NTT DoCoMo's dGame service was used as the release platform, while Ubitus' cloud technology was used for the streaming. It released on December 16, 2013. A second version was developed for the 3DS, using a similar streaming function to the mobile versions. This version released on September 4, 2014. On release, the 3DS version suffered from multiple technical problems, including issues with logging in, frequent maintenance periods, disconnection issues, poor sound quality, and the game's native text font being too small for the 3DS screen. The negative feedback caused Square Enix to temporarily stop shipments so they could fix the issues. The game receives regular story and gameplay updates, spaced out at ten-week intervals. Two physical expansion packs have been released, adding to the main story campaign: Nemureru Y≈´sha to Michibiki no Meiy≈´ Online on December 5, 2013; and Inishie no Ryuu no Denshou Online on April 30, 2015. Both expansions require the original release to function. The second expansion was the last to be released for the Wii prior to the end of service for the console. A bundle containing the original game and its two expansion packs, Dragon Quest X All- In-One Package, was released for Wii U and Microsoft Windows on December 3, 2015. The PS4 and Switch ports are both releasing as the All-In-One Package. A third expansion is planned for release in 2017. The game is region locked to Japan, as Square Enix implements IP blocking software to prevent external access. These restrictions were temporary removed for a few weeks in 2014, but returned. The game also received a manga adaptation, titled Dragon Quest: Souten no Soura. It is written by Yuuki Nakashima with supervision by Horii, and published by Shueisha. Dragon Quest X is one of the few Dragon Quest games that has not received a release in the West, despite fan demand. When asked in 2014 whether they would like to localize the game, the lead staff said they would \\"love to\\". In multiple interviews, staff have outlined the problems with localizing the title: the two main issues are the amount of text, and technical issues related to the servers and other elements involved in operating an MMORPG over multiple regions. A later interview at the 2016 Electronic Entertainment Expo revealed that Square Enix was testing the waters for the possible localization of Dragon Quest X and Dragon Quest XI with the recent Western 3DS releases of Dragon Quest VII and Dragon Quest VIII, in addition to new releases such as Dragon Quest Heroes and Dragon Quest Builders. In 2016, Square Enix stated that if enough fans demanded it, they would make efforts to bring Dragon Quest X overseas. That same year, a Chinese language version for Windows was localized for China. The Chinese language version was shut down in May 2019.https://web.archive.org/web/20190407000709/http://guangchang.dqx.sdo.com/sc/news/detail/f5f8590cd58a54e94377e6ae2eded4d9/  Reception  = Sales and subscriptions = During its debut week, Dragon Quest X topped Japanese gaming charts, selling 367,000 units. While this was seen as an impressive debut for an MMORPG in Japan, it was the worst sales debut of a mainline Dragon Quest game in recent years. Despite sales being low when compared to other entries, it succeeded in tripling sales for its console to 41,000 after a significant decline. By the end of August 2012, Dragon Quest X had sold 557,000 units, with Square Enix taking a 26% share of total game sales for the month after Nintendo. By November, Square Enix had shipped 700,000 units. It was ranked as the 10th best-selling titles of 2012, with 609,783 units. In its first week on sale, the Wii U version of the game sold 33,302 units, coming in at #6 on Japanese charts. The 3DS version also sold well, selling through over 95% of its shipment with 52,375 units. At release, the game's first expansion sold 117,000 units on Wii, reaching #2 in the charts. The Wii U version reached #6 with sales of 71,000 units. The third expansion's Wii U version debuted at #2 with 99,000, coming ahead of Xenoblade Chronicles X. As of 2014, the game has sold over one million copies across all platforms, and has a steady active base of 300,000 players per day. = Critical reception = Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu gave Dragon Quest X a score of 36 points out of 40, who delayed their review until they had sufficient experience with the game after launch. One reviewer praised the presentation \\"from the warmly familiar world to the story that has a tendency to wrap you up in it\\". They also praised the gameplay and its openness to accept novice players, despite the reviewer noting that it seemed to take longer to level up a character compared to offline Dragon Quest entries. Two of the other reviewers pointed out issues with messaging, and a lack of guidance about which enemies were too strong for a player character's current level. In an import preview, Kotaku's Richard Eisenbeis shared Famitsus praise of how the game was welcoming to players without experience of MMORPGs. An issue he pointed out with exploration and battle was that early sections required either a high level or a party for easy progression, but this eased up later into the game, in addition to enjoying the story and battle system. His main criticisms were the Chat systems, which were clumsy and difficult to use even with the right hardware peripheral, and the overly high amount of experience grinding he needed to do. He finished the preview by calling Dragon Quest X \\"surprisingly backwards in its execution despite its sometimes inspired ideas and low entry bar\\". Matt Walker of Nintendo World Report mainly focused on the gameplay, noting like Eisenbeis that the game required a lot of experience grinding, placed an emphasis on forming a party over playing alone, and made messaging other players a laborious process, despite the overall gameplay being enjoyable and absorbing. As to the graphics, which suffered a slowdown in areas with multiple players, he was impressed by the amount of textures and environmental effects when compared to other Wii titles. He concluded his preview by calling the game \\"a solid, enjoyable JRPG experience that has promise to be enjoyable for years to come\\".

The resulting turnover gives possession of the ball to the team currently on defense. In American football, both indoor and outdoor, a team has four opportunities (each opportunity is called a \\"down\\") to gain at least ten yards or to score. Any ground gained during each down short of these ten yards is kept for the next chance, and any ground lost must be regained in addition to the ten yards. Thus, if a team gains four yards on first down, it then has three chances to gain the six remaining yards, and if a team loses four yards on first down then it must gain a total of fourteen yards over the next three chances. If a team gains the required ten yards, it receives another four downs to gain another ten yards (an event called a \\"first down\\") or cross the goal line for a score. The same principles apply in Canadian football, except that a team has only three chances to gain ten yards instead of four. In the NFL, turnovers on downs are not counted as turnovers in statistics for either team; turnover statistics tally turnovers that occur during a play ‚Äî namely, fumble recoveries and interceptions. Strategy In most cases, teams will use one less chance (i.e. three in American football, two in Canadian football) than they are permitted to try to gain a first down. Usually, if a team has failed to gain the needed yardage when playing its final down, it will then punt the ball, offering the opposing team possession (the kicking team aims to place the ball downfield), or attempt to kick a field goal if close enough (typically within 40 yards of the goal posts). In the event of a successful punt, the opposing team will start its new set of downs at the spot the punt returner can advance the ball to before being tackled (or goes out of bounds), or where the punt goes out of bounds, or (in American football only) where the punt comes to rest when rolling to a stop or at the spot where the punt is fair-caught. =Reasons for attempting a 4th down= In some instances, a team may elect to use its last down to try to gain the yardage, rather than punt or kick a field goal . This is often referred to as \\"going for it\\" or \\"sticking\\" (as opposed to \\"kicking\\"). This disadvantage is that if this conversion attempt fails, the opposing team will immediately take possession of the ball at the spot where the play ended, rather than (usually) much farther away from a score in the case of a punt. Factors that may lead to a team making this choice are: * Only a small distance is needed to gain a first down * Only a small distance is needed to score a touchdown (a team's incentive to \\"go for it\\" in this situation may be higher due to the higher reward--a touchdown--if they succeed) * A team is close to, but not within field goal range, such that a punt may not net very many yards (in American football, if the punt reaches the end zone, the opposing team will get the ball on the 20-yard line). * A team believes it has a chance to convert the first down by way of a fake punt or a fake field goal. * A bad snap or a fumble by the offensive forces a team to abandon a field goal or punt attempt and unexpectedly go for it. * A blocked field goal or a punt by the defense ends up being recovered by the offense and unexpectedly goes for it. * A team believes the defense might cause a penalty thus giving the team on offense a closer distance to convert or, depending on the penalty, an automatic first down. * A team's kicking or punting team may not be very good and goes for it to avoid the possibility of missing a field goal or having a punt blocked. * At certain times of the year the weather might be factor into going for it instead of kicking or punting the ball. * The game's end is near and the team wants to score additional points to prevent the opposing team from coming back to tie or win the game. * The game's end is near or in overtime and if the team surrenders possession of the ball, it may not have another chance to score what is needed to win or tie the game. * The game's end is near, and the team is in field goal range but is trailing such that a field goal would not tie or win the game, but a touchdown would. * The game's end is near and the team is out of field goal range but there is enough time on the clock to execute one final play to score a touchdown to tie or win the game via Hail Mary pass or a series of lateral passes. * The game's first half end is near and they need to score a field goal or a touchdown to cut into the deficit, tie the game or go ahead before halftime. * A team is trailing by more than a touchdown, and needs a touchdown AND one or more additional scores to tie or win the game. * In certain situations near the end of the game the team on fourth down is leading, may attempt it to prevent the opposing team from possessing the ball for a game tying or game winning score. * In certain leagues, if a game is in overtime, the team may need to convert on fourth down in order to score a touchdown to win the game automatically, where as a field goal would not. * In certain leagues, in order to make the playoffs, tiebreaking procedures include points scored so a team might want to score touchdowns rather than field goals to win the tiebreaker. * Finally, there is no obvious reason to attempt a conversion, a team may nevertheless attempt one if it believes the attempt will surprise the defense or catch it off-balance. One American high school coach has achieved national notoriety for his absolute refusal to punt, regardless of field position. Kevin Kelley, head coach at Pulaski Academy in Little Rock, Arkansas, has led the school to multiple state championships with a heavily analytics-driven strategy. After becoming Pulaski's head coach in 2003, he ran across a research paper by a Harvard professor who argued that punting made no mathematical sense. Kelley responded by initially reducing punting to less than twice per game, and soon eliminating it altogether.

Description The long-snout clingfish is a small type of fish, which can grow up to .Randall, J.E., G.R. Allen and R.C. Steene, 1990. Fishes of the Great Barrier Reef and Coral Sea. University of Hawaii Press, Honolulu, Hawaii. 506 p. It has an elongated body and a stretched and spatulate snout. The snout is a criterion for recognizing the sex of the fish, since females have a longer and finer snout than males. This sexual dimorphism reflects a different diet between the two sexes. The body's background color varies from dark brown to red-brown, and the body has three yellowish longitudinal lines that run along the it, one on the top of the body and the two others on the median axis of the sides of the fish. The caudal fin is marked by a yellow spot in its center, and the snout can also have some yellow coloration. The longsnouted clingfish is been found to release a grammistin like toxic mucus on its skin. Distribution and habitat Long-snout clingfish are widespread throughout the tropical waters of the Indo-West Pacific region, inhabiting the region from the Gulf of Oman to Papua New Guinea.Lieske & Myers,Coral reef fishes,Princeton University Press, 2009, They are found in reef environments often associated with long-spined sea urchins particularly of the genus Diadema. Alimentation Long-snout clingfish feed mainly on burrowing bivalves in corals, tube feet of their host, and eggs of a commensal shrimp. The fish's sexual dimorphism is caused by a difference between the male's and the female's diet, causing the adult female to have a longer snout. The adult female eats small bivalves and shrimp's eggs more often than the adult male, who eat tube feet more frequently.

The bombo criollo, or simply bombo, is a family of Latin American drums derived from the European bass drum (also called in Spanish bombo) and native Latin American drum traditions. These drums are of smaller dimensions than the orchestral bass drum, and their frame can be made of wood or steel. They can be held vertically or diagonally on the body or a stand. The specific make of the instrument depends on the regional tradition. In Argentina, the bombo criollo is called bombo leg√ºero and played in many folkloric styles. In Cuba, bombos are the largest drums played by the street comparsas in Santiago. In other countries, the term tambora is commonly used. The bombo should not be confused with the Puerto Rican bomba, a genre of music played with hand drums called barriles de bomba (bomba barrels), which are unrelated to the European bass drums.  Argentina  The bombo leg√ºero is a common instrument in Argentine folk traditions such as zamba and chacarera. The body of the drum is made out of a hollowed tree trunk, and the head is made of animal skins.  Cuba  The bombo or tambora is the lowest drum used in conga santiaguera, the music of the street carnivals from Santiago de Cuba. They are tuneable, two-headed military drums introduced in the island by the Spanish settlers. In tumba francesa and tahona, two styles imported into Oriente by Afro-Haitian slaves after the Haitian Revolution, the bass drum (slightly smaller than the bombo) is called tambora, tamborita or tambuch√©. Tamboras Mexican brass band tambora. In some Latin American countries the term tambora is used to refer to bombos criollos. Nonetheless, tamboras are generally wider than other bombos criollos, possibly being an adaptation of both European bass drums (bombos) and side drums (redoblantes). =Colombia and Panama= In Colombia and Panama, tamboras are used to play cumbia. Traditionally, this kind of tambora is played with sticks and fixed on a stand. =Dominican Republic= In the Dominican Republic, tamboras are two-headed drums used in merengue music. They were traditionally made from salvaged rum barrels. =Mexico= Mexican tamboras have a diameter of 20 to 26 inches. There are two types of tambora in Mexican music: a traditional, with no cymbals, used in the folk ensembles tamborileros del norte, viol√≠n y tambora and jaraberos, and the one used en Mexican brass bands, as in banda sinaloense, tamborazo zacatecano and duranguense which has a cymbal over the frame and a stand for the drum. A felt mallet is used to beat the drum. =Venezuela= The Venezuelan tambora is played in gaita zuliana. It is a one-headed drum played with sticks. The player can sit on it or put it between his or her legs to perform rhythms on the instrument, strucking the head, the rim or the body of the drum.

The church complex of four buildings and a cemetery takes up a parcel between Wolcott (NY 9D), Rector, Phillips and Union Streets. It was founded in 1832 as a religious school that soon became St. Anna's Church of Fishkill Landing. The church and rectory were built in 1869 from a design by Frederick Clarke Withers, who later on considered the former one of his best buildings. The Gothic Revival-styled building strongly reflects contemporary Ecclesiological theories of appropriate church architecture. Despite some modifications and restoration, the buildings and grounds have remained largely as they were when first built. The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008 as \\"St. Luke's Episcopal Church Complex\\". Church complex Withers' original design included the church and its rectory, on the corner of Wolcott and Rector. A Parish House was added near the end of the 19th century. It was added to, and a garage built, in the mid-20th. The church buildings and cemetery were laid out by Henry Winthrop Sargent. =Church= St. Luke's is a one-and-half-story asymmetrical cruciform building faced in Schenectady bluestone in an ashlar pattern with Ohio sandstone trim. It is over a hundred feet (30 m) in length and 60 feet (20 m) wide. Two porches extend from the south profile, a main entrance in the middle of the nave and a secondary one in the transept. There is another porch, pent-roofed, on the north transept. An organ and robing room is attached to the north side of the chancel. The gabled roof is covered in a variety of materials, mostly cement-asbestos shingles, with some areas of slate and metal. A frame bell cote topped with cast iron cross rises from the west end. The roofline is further pierced by a stone chimney on the north transept and several English Decorated Gothic stone crosses at junctions on the east end. All windows are either lancet or round- arched, with some having additional trefoils. The stained glass was done by Louis Comfort Tiffany's firm and the British glaziers Bell & Almond. Above the main entrance is a bronze lamp with a stone medallion of a bull, the symbol of St. Luke. The interior walls are plaster applied over an interior brick face, with vertical beadboard and molded chair rail complemented by a similar cornice at the joint between the walls and ceiling. The slip pews are made of oak with tre- and quatrefoil carvings at the ends. The floors in the center and side aisles are laid in a polychrome glass pattern, with carpet covering the area under the pews. There is a brass dedication plaque on the west wall. Open stained pine trusses spring from corbels along the walls frame the ceiling. They are complemented by sandstone at the arches between the building sections and surrounding the windows and doors. The nave is lit by hanging lamps. In the chancel the bishop's throne, sedilia, prayer desk and stalls are all oak like the pews. The font is of Aubigny stone on a sandstone shaft. Below the church is its basement. It remains largely unfinished, as it was when the church was built, and unused. =Rectory= The rectory was part of Withers' original design, and built along with the church. It is a likewise asymmetrical two-and-a-half-story structure of bluestone walls with brick trim, rebuilt to its original plan after a fire. The south-facing front features a gable and tower; the east elevation has a double gable. The west elevation has a single gabled dormer window with half-timbering. The roof is shingled in asphalt. Rectory, south (front) elevation, 2008 Inside, the house's decor reflects later Victorian stylings, due to the era in which it was rebuilt. The walls are plaster on lath; the floorboards are thin oak. The woodwork, particularly the mantels, use Eastlake decorative motifs. In the hallway next to the main staircase is the church's safe. The basement is, like the church's, unfinished. =Other outbuildings= The Parish House on Rector Street is a Romanesque Revival building with a large modern frame addition. A fireplace within it retains a cast-iron decorative plate from the rectory at the church's earlier location in downtown Beacon. Due to the additions, it is not considered a contributing property to the church's overall historic character. The only other building on the property is the garage. It is a modern structure made of concrete blocks, and is also a non-contributing resource. =Cemetery and landscaping= While it is level at the southeast corner where the church buildings are, the grounds become gently undulating to the north. Sargent planted specimen trees along the edges, many of which survive. They mostly follow an irregular pattern, except for those that border a path to the church's north porch. The gravestones date from the mid-19th century to the present and include a variety of styles of funerary art. Two notable examples are a brownstone marker with a crocketed pinnacle whose date and decedent cannot be determined, and the Neoclassical monument of Isaac Van Nostrand, with a base, plinth and fluted Roman Doric column. =Aesthetics= Sargent and Withers were both devout Episcopalians, and followers of the contemporary Ecclesiological movement in church design that advocated the Gothic Revival style of rural English parish churches, similar to the work of A.W. Pugin, as the best form for an Anglican or Episcopal church. Withers, already having been exposed to this in his native England, had professed his allegiance to Ecclesiological principles in an 1858 essay, \\"A Few Hints on Church Building\\". His brief work with Andrew Jackson Downing and fellow English immigrant Calvert Vaux prior to the former's death had further strengthened his appreciation for the Picturesque mode of the Gothic Revival Withers' design strongly reflects Downing's ideals of church design, of a building that harmonizes with the surrounding natural landscape. Several features, such as the broad nave, full transept, deep chancel, large south porch and frame bell cote, are exactly as prescribed by Ecclesiological writers. He involved himself in many of the church's minor details, even designing the altar cloth himself. In his 1873 book Church Architecture, he devoted a great deal of text and an illustration to St. Luke's, suggesting he was very proud of how it turned out. The Rectory likewise reflects Withers' less conservative visions of domestic architecture on a smaller scale than his usual work, with its irregular and asymmetrical roofline and alternation of brick and stone. Its original tower, destroyed and not rebuilt after a later fire, enhanced its Gothic qualities with a steeply pitched roof. Sargent's landscape was one of the rare times he and Withers worked together on a property. Its most notable Picturesque feature is the irregular placement of its trees apart from those that border the path from the church and the streets surrounding the plot. History Since before the Revolution Fishkill's Trinity Church had been the only Episcopal house of worship in southeastern Dutchess County. It was not easily accessible to residents of the hamlets of Matteawan and Fishkill Landing, today's Beacon. So, in 1832, three local sisters began offering religious instruction to children at their house, today's Madam Brett Homestead. Their parents and other adults met in a dry goods store, and by the end of the year the group had reached the size where it could form a parish of its own. In 1833 it formally incorporated as St. Anna's, and the next year built a small brick church with columned portico at what is now the intersection of Main Street and Tioronda Avenue on donated land. In the following decades, Tioronda became the railroad's right-of-way, making it a less desirable location. The church became neglected in turn. So the congregation decided in 1863 to build a new church elsewhere. One congregant, Charles Wolcott, gave six acres next to the church's then- cemetery. In 1866 he added the adjacent land of equal size then used as a cemetery by a local Presbyterian church. The deed stipulated that a religious edifice of at least $20,000 in value ($ inflation adjusted 1866 value) had to be built on the property within three years of its conveyance to the church. To raise the money, the church sold both its old church and rectory. Withers, who had already built the Reformed Dutch Church of Fishkill Landing in the future city and the Eustatia home of John Monell, one of St. Anna's vestrymen, was easily recruited to design the new church and rectory due to his devout Episcopalianism and relationships with members of the church. Sargent was, at the time of St. Luke's construction, also a vestryman. Ground was broken in 1868, and the church officially became St. Luke's Church of Matteawan and the first service was held the following year. The other buildings included the rectory and a small frame schoolhouse where the Parish House now stands. The total construction cost came to $60,000 ($ in 2008 dollars). This debt took a while to retire, and as a result the church was not formally consecrated until 1879. In 1887, fire severely damaged the rectory. The outside was salvaged, but the interior had to be rebuilt. The original floor plan was recreated, but some more contemporary decor was added. Five years later, in 1892, the church decided to demolish the original schoolhouse and replace it with the Parish House. The building was supposed to be cross-shaped, but that design could not be completed as there was not enough money to complete its construction. The addition of the Great Hall in the 1950s finally completed the original design. During that period, the church building itself also got a new heating system, carpet for the floor under the pews, and the current roof tiles. The church today Per its roots, St. Luke's maintains an active youth ministry and choir. It also hosts a local Alcoholics Anonymous chapter, and is a charter sponsor of a local Boy Scout troop. The church also has strong ties to The Children's Villa, a home for orphaned and abandoned children in Amistad, Bolivia.

It was built from 1830 to 1837 by Cornelius and Rebecca O'Brien. It is also known as Hamilton Hume's House, Humedale Stud, and New Nordrach Institute for Consumption. The property is owned by the National Trust of Australia (NSW). It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 March 2002. It is one of the oldest surviving rural houses in Yass, New South Wales. It has historic significance as a relatively intact complex of rural buildings. It has a variety of significant natural and built elements, including an example of an early tree called the Picconia, a relative of the olive and rare in Australia, which is almost extinct in its native Canary Islands. Cooma Cottage stands as evidence of what the first settlers built for themselves, their families and servants. The handmade bricks and crafted woodwork are the result of local skills and manufacturing. The cottage grew from a bungalow through a series of additions over the 19th century. The cottage has important heritage values as the home of Hamilton Hume for more than 30 years from 1839, after he ended his travels and became a grazier. It is a valuable part of the early development of the merino wool industry in Australia.  History  Overland explorer Hamilton Hume (1797-1873) discovered the Yass district around the Yass River in 1821. He returned to the area in 1824 while on an expedition to Geelong (Port Phillip) with Captain William Hovell. Hume was subsequently granted a parcel of land in the area which he took up in 1829.ACNT, 1988, 50 The 100 acres on which Cooma Cottage is situated was originally part of 960 acres granted to pastoralist Henry O'Brien in 1829. In 1833 100 acres in the south-east corner of Henry O'Brien's grant was transferred to W. H. Broughton for Mrs Rebecca O'Brien (Broughton's daughter), wife of Cornelius O'Brien, Henry's brother. The original cottage was quite refined: an archetypal colonial bungalow of diminutive scale, it formed the opposite front to the entrance and faced north over the Yass River. It was the garden front of this extraordinary country house. The timber cottage had been built by the Anglo-Irish O'Brien brothers, pastoralists of note, and was the home of Cornelius, while Henry lived to its west at the still-surviving Duoro.Lucas, 2004, 17-18 In 1837 Thomas Walker described it as a \\"very nice and commodious cottage, very well furnished and with everything comfortable about it; the grounds and gardens nicely laid out, but as yet quite in their infancy\\".Lucas, 2004, 18 Hamilton Hume purchased the 100 acres from Henry, Rebecca and Cornelius O'Brien in June 1839. Hume, it is said, was in love with the spot and had, in fact, camped there in 1824 on his epic overland journey to Port Phillip with Hovell. Hume was to live at Cooma Cottage for the rest of his life and it was he who added some 20 rooms to the house in fits and starts over, at least, the next 20 years. While the whole eventually came together as a Palladian composition centred on the portico it was, in fact, a conglomerate mess of uncomfortable rooms, meanly lit and with a plan which depended almost entirely on going outside in the cruel winters of the Yass plains. Except for the handsome stables block, thought to be designed by the Goulburn architect James Sinclair, nothing Hume built could be described as fine. With the exception of the kitchen block, it is hard to know what these rooms were used for; storage and perhaps strangers' rooms for putting up guests and of course rooms for employees. Hume and his wife were childless and presumably made use of the original O'Brien rooms with their pretty north-facing verandah and elegant French casements, almost like bookcase doors, opening onto it. The name \\"Cooma\\" is intriguing and is said to derive from the diminutive of County Murray (Co. Mur) in which region it lies. The main street of Yass is called Comur Street, pronounced like the property.Lucas, 2004, 19 The Humes seem to have simply used the name \\"Cooma\\" and there are numerous letters simply headed \\"Cooma, Yass\\".Lucas, 2004, 18-19 A list of plants obtained by Hume from Camden Park nursery in 1850 include a number of mulberry trees, white figs and two Moorepark apricots, with 12 common laurel trees and a selection of flowering plants, while a Macarthur List identifies early roses. Hume had extensive vineyards at Cooma Cottage in the 1860s. Hume enlarged his holding in 1862 by purchasing 34 acres, 7 perches from W. W. Billyard. Hume and his wife, Elizabeth continued to live at Cooma Cottage until his death in 1873, Elizabeth stayed on in the house until c.1875 where after she moved into Yass, dying at \\"Cliftonwood\\" in 1886. Hamilton Hume had left Cooma Cottage property to his wife Elizabeth and his nephew John Kennedy Hume.ACNT, 1988 Elizabeth's was a life interest and Cooma Cottage was left to Hamilton's favourite nephew John Kennedy Hume, son of his youngest brother Francis Rawdon Hume (1803‚Äì88) of Appin. John Kennedy Hume (1840-1905), lived at Cooma Cottage with his wife Emma (n√©e Clayton) and family. Their son Hamilton Hume Jr was born there in 1875 and died in 1877. His only heir was his daughter, Ellen (Miss E.C.Hume) . At that time the small brick cottage was occupied by a Mrs Geale. It is uncertain how long J. K. Hume lived at Cooma Cottage as he was recorded as living at Camden and at Beulah, Appin by 1888. Much of the original furnishings went with them. Some of this ended up being gifted to the Yass Historical Society and this is now on loan to the National Trust (NSW). It includes a fine cedar dining table, a cedar secretaire and two exceptional demi-lune side tables veneered in she-oak (Casuarina sp.). There are references to two families living at Cooma Cottage in late nineteenth and early twentieth century, namely the Clayton family (relatives of J.K.Hume's wife, Emma) and the Unwin family. John Unwin was born in 1900 and the family lived there until the death of the father in 1902. The Unwins used the house as a sanatorium for consumptives in the late 1890s. In the \\"Town and Country Journal\\" of 1/7/1899 it was written up as the \\"New Nordrach Institute for Consumption\\". The climate at Cooma Cottage can be quite bracing. A photograph shows post and rail fencing to the north side of the house. In 1910 the property was set aside for closer settlement and became part of the Hardwicke settlement purchase area. It was advertised as Farm 28 in the Government Gazette on 2 November. It was purchased by William Bawden. In the following year Farm 27 was added to the above settlement purchase. In 1924 Bawden died and in 1925 Portions 31 & 32 comprising Farms 27 and 28 were transferred to John (Jack) Leo Bourke of Yass. Bourke used the property, evidently in association with his father as a horse stud. At that time it was called \\"Humedale Stud\\" - this also stated it was owned by P.M. and J.L.Bourke. Small areas of the property were resumed for upgrading the Hume Highway (1938 and 1962) and for a transmission line (1944). Mary Kennedy (n√©e Hume) remembered that in the 1950s the property included a large orchard and vineyard. By 1970 the National Trust of Australia (NSW) was concerned about the condition of the house and had expressed interest in purchasing it. Approaches to acquire it failed, the owner J. L. (Jack) Bourke refusing to sell it to the Trust. Mary Griffiths, a Canberra resident, had fallen for it and persuaded Bourke to sell it to her. It was in a terrible state. Mrs Griffiths agreed to transfer the property to Trust ownership in return for the Trust spending $35,000 on it. She was to retain a life tenancy and intended to use it as a country retreat.Lucas, 2004, 17 Bourke sold the property (100 acres) to the National Trust of Australia (NSW) in 1970 who leased it to Mary Griffiths. Portion 31 (the western portion of the property) was subsequently transferred to Griffiths in 1979. In March 1970 architect John Fisher LFRAIA (of then Fisher, Jackson & Hudson) was appointed to spend the money and in effect save the house. Mr Fisher worked with Clive Lucas, architect, as his associate. Every room leaked and Jack Bourke had retreated to one room in the south-west wing where a smoky fire, elderly hens, dogs, cobwebs and dirt prevailed. Ceilings were collapsing, verandahs sagging, brick walls crumbling, damp and decay were everywhere. And the house was not a cottage at all but was over 30 rooms, with cellar, plus coach house and stables. The National Trust of Australia (NSW) began conservation works in 1971 by replacing the roof and repairing the \\"Shepherds Cottage\\" for use by Jack Bourke who was moved out of the house.NT Cooma Cottage CMP, 1987/88, 5 The first moneys had to \\"put the umbrella up\\" and make the house dry again as well as make the shepherd's cottage, to the south, habitable for Jack Bourke who was to have a life tenancy. The original O'Brien house had been shingled, as had some of the Hume additions, but by about 1860 the whole was sheeted in the patent iron tiles made in England by Morewood & Rogers. The tile roof was still there in 1970 but in terrible order. Iron tiles were remade, verandahs jacked up, columns added to by about a foot (300mm), the roof strutted and the large and complicated roof re- sheeted. This, plus upgrading the shepherd's cottage, was all that could be done with the initial funds. Works were complete by late 1971. The Australian Heritage Commission National Estate grants of the post-1973 period allowed further work to proceed. In 1975 the brickwork was repaired, the front of the original timber cottage was underpinned and levelled so that at least the French doors into the verandah could open. The external joinery was repaired, sashes reconstructed and the ashlar plastering repaired. In the summer of 1978‚Äì79 the house was painted outside for probably the first time in 100 years. In June 1873 we know that the weatherboard section was painted by John Colls of Yass. At the same time, the drawing room got a new chimney piece and three rooms were wallpapered. By the end of 1979 the interior of the O'Brien house had been repaired, the fine cedar joinery made good and the garden restored to a plan by James Broadbent. In 1979 Mrs Griffiths gave up her interest in the house in return for a piece of land on the western corner of the property. The final thrust of the works took place in 1986‚Äì8, in time for the Australian Bicentennial.Lucas, 2004, 18-20 This was one of 13 historic properties included in 'A Gift to the Nation, sponsored solely by AMATIL Ltd. Shutters were reconstructed, the rest of the interiors conserved and wallpapers reproduced for several of the rooms. The important picket fence across the forecourt was also rebuilt. The house was officially opened on 19 April 1988. The National Trust's policy for the grounds has been to conserve the cottage's setting within its extensive 100 acres, and to protect the existing visual links with other rural properties established along the Yass River. Archaeological excavations have identified changed soil conditions at the front of the property which indicated the likelihood of an early carriage loop in front of the house, and patches of organically rich topsoil, which suggest the sites of garden beds.Le Seuer, 2004 In 2008‚Äì09, the shepherd's cottage was upgraded with funding from the NSW Department of Planning and donations from the National Trust Women's Committee. The cottage is now tenanted. The cottage is now tenanted.NSW National Trust Magazine, November 2008-January 2009; Silink & Hayes, 2014 The National Trust has begun developing new education and public programs to increase property visitation. The highlight of 2015 was the second \\"Sculptures in the Paddock\\" festival in collaboration with Yass Arts, held in September when over 30 sculptures were on display.NTA, 2015, 5  Description  The original section of the cottage is among the earliest remaining rural homesteads in New South Wales. To this colonial bungalow Hume added his own version of Palladian style wings and a Greek revival portico. The immediate landscape is virtually unchanged since the 19th century although fast-developing Yass spreads nearby and busy roads have started to intrude. The physical condition of the site was reported as good at as at 27 June 2000. =Estate/ Grounds= The Trust's policy for the grounds has been to conserve the cottage's setting within its extensive 100 acres, and to protect the existing visual links with other rural properties established along the Yass River. Archaeological excavations have identified changed soil conditions at the front of the property which indicated the likelihood of an early carriage loop in front of the house, and patches of organically rich topsoil, which suggest the sites of garden beds. One nationally rare feature of the site's landscaping is a palo blanco tree (Picconia excelsa) a relative of the olive, from the Canary Islands - a large tree growing at the rear (the original front, at the east) of the house. This species is rarely found in NSW (specimens are in the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney, Camden Park, Denham Court and Yasmar's gardens), and also around Australia (22 are known nationally, including at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne; Geelong Botanic Gardens and at Marybank, a garden in Adelaide's Hills). This tree is endangered in its natural habitat, the \\"laurisilva\\" cloud rainforests of the Canary Islands.Stuart Read, pers.comm., 10/10/2012 =Homestead= Cooma Cottage is a one-storey structure consisting of a number of different sections: a stud frame weatherboard northern section; stud frame and bricknogged central sections, and a solid brick range across the south. There is a central enclosed yard or \\"arcade\\", which opens to the south. The north section has a verandah which returns on its east and west sides to terminate in box rooms. The south range has flanking wings or \\"pavilions\\" linked by a verandah. A pedimented portico situated symmetrically between the two pavilions interrupts this verandah. There is a cellar partially under the house, which is accessed from the arcade. The external walls are either weatherboard or plaster lined out in ashlar. The walls of the arcade are painted brick. The roof has some 34 different pitches, closely articulating the spaces and sections below. The roof is clad in reproduction galvanised iron roofing tiles. The roof structure is battened to receive shingles below the iron tiles. In one location the shingle roof has survived. Above the arcade (below the roof of the south range) there is a roof cladding of split tapered weatherboards. The floors throughout the northern and central sections of the house are timber with the exception of two small pantry rooms which flank the rear hall. These two rooms have floors tiled with terracotta pavers. The west half of the southern range has timber floors while the east half have both brick and tile floors. The north verandah is floored in both tiles and bricks. The south verandah is floored in brick though the section corresponding to the portico is flagged with sandstone. The arcade is floored in brick. The cellar has a dirt floor. The majority of the internal walls are plastered. The ceilings are largely lath and plaster (in various states of disrepair) with a few exexceptionsref name=nswshr-1496/> The joinery throughout is largely cedar, polished in the front hall, drawing room and Hume's dressing room but painted throughout the rest of the house. The walls in the north and central sections have been both painted and wallpapered at various times. The walls in the remaining areas have received only paint. With few exceptions the structural timber throughout the house has been cut by pit saw. The exceptions include the timbers introduced during the 1971-81 conservation works and minor twentieth century changes.NT Cooma Cottage CMP, 1987/88 :13 =Outbuildings= A brick stables block is at right angles to the main facade of the homestead and to its west. The stable and outhouses were among the changes Hamilton Hume carried out. The gabled coach house is considered a particularly good or fine example of such buildings. = Modifications and dates = The 100 acres on which Cooma Cottage is situated was originally part of 960 acres granted to pastoralist Henry O'Brien in 1829. 1839: Hume bought 100 acres of Cooma Cottage estate. 1862: Hume added 34 acres 16 purchases to the estate. 1890s: used as a sanitorium 1925: used as a horse stud 1938, 1944, 1962: Small areas of the property were resumed for upgrading the Hume Highway (1938 and 1962) and for a transmission line (1944). 1971: The Trust replaced the roof and repaired the 'Shepherd's Cottage for use by Jack Bourke who was moved out of the house. Later works involved repairing and reconstructing badly weathered sections of external walling and external joinery, structural repairs and painting the exterior.

Income from the rental will be used to support Cooma Cottage. = Further information = The construction history of Cooma Cottage has been the subject of much investigation. In the 1982 Draft Conservation Analysis and Policy it was stated that the 'sequence of construction of Hume's section of the house is still far from clear'. Although more evidence has come to light since that time this statement not only still applies but can be extended to cover the section believed to have been built by Cornelius O'Brien. There seems little way of conclusively establishing the constructional history without disrupting large sections of fabric.NT Cooma Cottage CMP, September 1987/88 :13  Heritage listing  As at 27 July 2000, Cooma Cottage was the home of the famous Australian explorer, Hamilton Hume. The house demonstrates a form, which has grown from a bungalow through a series of additions-idiosyncratic, apparently haphazard, or sophisticated - to be fully united in Palladian form. The variety and juxtaposition of building techniques and materials is exceptional. The house remains within its original unspoilt historic curtilage and retains visual links, and is integral with the adjacent landscape and early properties. (NTA (NSW), 1987/88, 35) Cooma Cottage's principal significance is for its composition of buildings which form a unique Palladian form often sought but rarely achieved in Australian colonial architecture, and for its historical association with the famous Australian explorer Hamilton Hume. It is one of the oldest surviving rural homesteads in the Yass district and southern NSW. The original cottage in planning and execution is a particularly good example of an early Australian house. The relative intactness of form and interior spaces make the buildings a rare survival of colonial architecture in Australia. It is a rare example in NSW of Moorwood & Rogers roofing. It is a good example of an early homestead group of buildings confirmed by photographic evidence to be in a very similar form to that which it had throughout its existence. Its stables and coach house are a particularly substantial and fine example of 19th century rural architecture. Both the immediate vicinity and the original 100 acre property are unspoiled by substantial later development and provide a compatible and potentially appropriate setting for the homestead group. The property is particularly evocative of an Australian pastoral pioneering outpost. The homestead forms part of a group of established homesteads of varying ages along the Yass River, those particularly within its catchment being Douro and Hardwicke. The property is an important archaeological resource to scholars interested in building construction, landscaping and usage patterns. The early part of the house and the land have associations of regional significance with the O'Brien family, who were important pioneer pastoralists of the area. (This statement excludes consideration of the significance of landscaping features of the site)Lucas, 1982 One nationally rare feature of the site's landscaping is a palo blanco tree (Picconia excelsa) a relative of the olive, from the Canary Islands at the rear (original front) of the house. This species is rarely found in NSW, and Australia.Stuart Read, pers.comm., 6/2006 Cooma Cottage was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 March 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Cooma Cottage was the home of the famous Australian explorer Hamilton Hume. Cooma Cottage is one of the oldest surviving rural houses in Southern New South Wales. The place is the focus of an important historical landscape demonstrating the complex relationship of family and social connections and of the discovery and development of the area and its communications. As leading pioneers in this district, the O'Brien and Hume families held significant status in regional, civic and social fields and, as pioneers of the wool industry in Australia. The place is significant through its association with European inland exploration and settlement of Southern NSW, particularly in its links with the 1824 overland journey of Hume and Hovell and later as the site of an important local crossing of the Yass river which developed into the major road south to Victoria (the Great Southern Road, now the Hume Highway). It also appears to have been crossroad for major routes linking, Bathurst, Queanbeyan, Melbourne and Sydney.NT Cooma Cottage CMP, 1987/88:35, 37 The place has historic significance as a relatively intact complex of rural buildings, with elements of its original garden, paddock systems and plantings surviving, including early trees such as the Picconia species to the east of the house, a relative of the olive and rare in Australia, being almost extinct also in its native Canary Islands. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The house demonstrates a form, which has grown from a bungalow through a series of additions-idiosyncratic, apparently haphazard, or sophisticated to be finally united in Palladian form. The variety and juxtaposition of building techniques and materials is exceptional. The house remains within its original unspoiled historic curtilage and retains integral visual links with its surrounding landscape, the river and hills beyond, and early properties. The original wooden cottage, in planning and execution, is an example of the early Australian verandah house. The coach house and stables are a fine example of mid 19th century rural architecture.NT Cooma Cottage CMP, 1987/88: 25 The outbuildings complex, early tree plantings and garden and farm elements survive. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The composition of its buildings forming a unique Palladian form often sought after but rarely achieved in Australian colonial architecture. The garden contains east of the homestead a Picconia species, a tree which is a relative of the olive, rare in Australia, and almost extinct in its native Canary Islands. This tree is nationally rare, and only some 12 specimens are known in Australia, either in Botanic Gardens (Sydney, Melbourne, Geelong) or major early private gardens (Camden Park, Denham Court, Marybank, SA).

Structure The ownership of the company similarly split into- * 40% Rolls-Royce * 40% MTU Aero Engines * 20% Avio S.p.A. (formerly Fiat Aviazione) It had an office on Arabellastra√üe in Munich near both NAMMA and Panavia, but the head office was initially at Filton. It was known as Rolls-Royce Turbo-Union Ltd. Turbo-Union was a fully integrated and collaborative European Company, whose formal language was English, by kind and charitable agreement of the Governments concerned. The organisation of the company was of FG (Functional Group) kind - for example, FG4 was Concept Design Engineering, FG6 was Customer Support Engineering and Provisioning, and so on. Each FG was chaired by a European person included people from all three companies as required. The FG also had subgroups - for example, FG4-4 was Development, FG6-2 was FTC (Flight Test Centre) support. The company is now based at the home of Rolls-Royce in Derby, but also has an office at the Panavia head office in Germany at Hallbergmoos. Production sites Turbo Union as a whole designed and produced the engine, albeit the GA (General Arrangement) drawing was assembled at Bristol (Filton) from all three partners' inputs. Over 2000 engines were built up to and including the 1990s, from components sourced in all three countries in approximate proportion to their Governmental support. The RAF had engines assembled and supported from Bristol, the German Air Force and Navy from Munich, and the Italian Air Force from Turin (Torino). History When it was formed in October 1969 it was claimed to be the largest aero-engine consortium in the world. The RB199 would be Europe's biggest ever military engine programme, and was based at Filton. Development of the Rolls-Royce RB199 started in September 1969, prior to the formation of Turbo-Union. The first RB199 engine ran in September 1971, with the first flight in a Tornado in August 1974. The engines are all FADEC controlled with slightly different engine versions for each Tornado variant. The French took no part in the European project, not least because it was a direct competitor of the Snecma M53 engine. However, later in the 1980s, the French joined MTU Turbomeca Rolls-Royce to build the MTR MTR390 helicopter engine. In 1983, a Swiss organisation, the Arbeitsgruppe f√ºr Luft und Raumfahrt (ALR) based in Zurich, proposed an aircraft called the Piranha 6 powered by a single RB199. The first prototype Eurofighter planes used the RB199 engine, until in June 1995 when the first EJ200-engined plane took off from Turin. Its predecessor, the British Aerospace EAP, also used the engines. =Management= The first Chairman was Hugh Conway, the Managing Director of the Bristol (Filton) plant of Rolls-Royce. Marshal of the Royal Air Force Denis Spotswood was Chairman from 1975-80. For many years, the designer of the Pegasus engine, Gordon Lewis, was Managing Director.

Asramam Maidan in Kollam city, India. It is the largest open space available in any of the city limits in Kerala state. In land-use planning, urban green space is open-space areas reserved for parks and other \\"green spaces\\", including plant life, water features and other kinds of natural environment. Most urban open spaces are green spaces, but occasionally include other kinds of open areas. The landscape of urban open spaces can range from playing fields to highly maintained environments to relatively natural landscapes. Generally considered open to the public, urban green spaces are sometimes privately owned, such as higher education campuses, neighborhood/community parks/gardens, and institutional or corporate grounds. Areas outside city boundaries, such as state and national parks as well as open space in the countryside, are not considered urban open space. Streets, piazzas, plazas and urban squares are not always defined as urban open space in land use planning. Urban green spaces have wide reaching positive impacts on the health of individuals and communities near the green space. Urban greening policies are important for revitalizing communities, reducing financial burdens of healthcare and increasing quality of life. Most policies focus on community benefits, and reducing negative effects of urban development, such as surface runoff and the urban heat island effect. Historically, access to green space has favored wealthier, and more privelaged communities, thus recent focus in urban greening has increasingly focused on environmental justice concerns, and community engagement in the greening process. In particular, in cities with economic decline, such as the Rust Belt in the United States, urban greening has broad community revitalization impacts. Definitions and concepts Most research on the topic focus on urban green spaces. The WHO defined this as \\"all urban land covered by vegation of any kind\\". When doing research, some experts use \\"urban open space\\" to describe a broader range of open areas. One definition holds that, \\"As the counterpart of development, urban open space is a natural and cultural resource, synonymous with neither 'unused land' nor 'park and recreation areas.\\" Another is \\"Open space is land and/or water area with its surface open to the sky, consciously acquired or publicly regulated to serve conservation and urban shaping function in addition to providing recreational opportunities.\\" In almost all instances, the space referred to by the term is, in fact, green space, focused on natural areas. These spaces are part of \\"public space\\" broadly construed, which include meeting or gathering places that exist outside the home and workplace that are generally accessible by members of the public, and which foster resident interaction and opportunities for contact and proximity. This definition implies a higher level of community interaction and places a focus on public involvement rather than public ownership or stewardship.Troy, NY, U.S., an example of privately owned urban open spacealt=A grassy area with tall trees leaving shadows from the sun above. In the distance are small rowhouses, and a street is at the right. Benefits The benefits that urban open space provides to citizens can be broken into four basic forms; recreation, ecology, aesthetic value, and positive health impacts. Psychological benefits gained by visitors to urban green spaces increased with their biodiversity, indicating that 'green' alone is not sufficient; the quality of that green is important as well. =Recreational= Sad Janka Kr√°ƒæa park in Bratislava (Slovakia) Urban open space is often appreciated for the recreational opportunities it provides. Recreation in urban open space may include active recreation (such as organized sports and individual exercise) or passive recreation, which may simply entail being in the open space. Research shows that when open spaces are attractive and accessible, people are more likely to engage in physical activity.Hartig, Terry. \\"Three steps to understanding restorative environments as health resources.\\" Open Space People Space. Ed. Catharine Ward Thompson and Penny Travlou. London: Taylor and Francis, 2007. Time spent in an urban open space for recreation offers a reprieve from the urban environment and a break from over-stimulation. Studies done on physically active adults middle aged and older show there are amplified benefits when the physical activities are coupled with green space environments. Such coupling leads to decreased levels of stress, lowers the risk for depression as well as increase the frequency of participation in exercise. Casual group walks in a green environment (nature walks) increase one's positive attitude and lower stress levels as well as risk of depression. =Ecological= The conservation of nature in an urban environment has direct impact on people for another reason as well. A Toronto civic affairs bulletin entitled Urban Open Space: Luxury or Necessity makes the claim that \\"popular awareness of the balance of nature, of natural processes and of man's place in and effect on nature ‚Äì i.e., \\"ecological awareness\\" ‚Äì is important. As humans live more and more in man-made surroundings ‚Äì i.e., cities ‚Äì he risks harming himself by building and acting in ignorance of natural processes.\\" Beyond this man-nature benefit, urban open spaces also serve as islands of nature, promoting biodiversity and providing a home for natural species in environments that are otherwise uninhabitable due to city development. By having the opportunity to be within an urban green space, people gain a higher appreciation for the nature around them. As Bill McKibben mentions in his book The End of Nature, people will only truly understand nature if they are immersed within it. He follows in Henry David Thoreau's footsteps when he isolated himself in the Adirondack Mountains in order to get away from society and the overwhelming ideals it carries. Even there he writes how society and human impact follows him as he sees airplanes buzzing overhead or hears the roar of motorboats in the distance. =Aesthetic= The aesthetic value of urban open spaces is self-evident. People enjoy viewing nature, especially when it is otherwise extensively deprived, as is the case in urban environments. Therefore, open space offers the value of \\"substituting gray infrastructure.\\"Eysenbach, Mary. \\"Park System Function and Services.\\" From Recreation to Re-creation. American Planning Association, 2008. One researcher states how attractive neighborhoods contribute to positive attitudes and social norms that encourage walking and community values. Properties near urban open space tend to have a higher value. One study was able to demonstrate that, \\"a pleasant view can lead to a considerable increase in house price, particularly if the house overlooks water (8‚Äì10%) or open space (6‚Äì12%).\\" Certain benefits may be derived from exposure to virtual versions of the natural environment, too. For example, people who were shown pictures of scenic, natural environments had increased brain activity in the region associated with recalling happy memories, compared to people that were shown pictures of urban landscapes. = Impact on health = The World Health Organization considers urban green spaces as important to human health. These areas have a positive impact on mental and physical health. Urban open spaces often include trees or other shrubbery that contribute to moderating temperatures and decreasing air pollution . Perceived general health is higher in populations with a higher percentage of green space in their environments. Urban open space access has also been directly related to reductions in the prevalence and severity of chronic diseases resulting from sedentary lifestyles, to improvements in mental well-being, and to reductions in population-wide health impacts from climate change.  Reductions in Chronic Disease Rates  Improved access to green space is associated with reductions in cardiovascular disease symptoms, improved rates of physical activity, lower incidence of obesity, and improved respiratory health. Lower rates of cardiovascular biomarkers are associated with access to green space, showing a reduction in cardiovascular disease risk in populations living within 1 km of green space. Not only does access to urban green space reduce risk of cardiovascular disease, but increased access has been shown to improve recovery from major adverse cardiovascular events and lower all-cause mortality. Relationships have been found between increased access to green space, improved rates of physical activity, and reduced BMI. The percentage of sedentary and moderately active persons making use of an urban park increased when access to the park was improved.  Reductions in Mental Illness rates / Improved Social Cohesion  Mental illness has been a major taboo and concern in the current fast paced world in which time to relax is undervalued. Globally, mental illness is linked to eight million deaths each year.Insel, T. (2015, February 24). Mortality and Mental Disorders. Retrieved October 15, 2019 from https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/directors/thomas- insel/blog/2015/mortality-and-mental-disorders.shtml. In urban areas, limited access to green space and poor quality of green spaces available may contribute to poor mental health outcomes. The distance an individual lives from a green space or park and the proportion of land designated as open space/parks has been shown to be inversely related to anxiety/mood disorder treatment counts in the community. Improved mental health may therefore be related to both measures - to distance from open space and proportion of open space within a neighborhood. Even when physical activity rates are not shown to increase with greater access to green space, greater access to green space has been shown to decrease stress and improve social cohesion.  Effects of Urban Green Space on Respiratory Health  Adequate urban green space access can be associated with better respiratory health outcomes, as long as green space areas meet certain requirements. A new study showed that mortality due to pneumonia and chronic lower respiratory diseases could be reduced by minimizing fragmentation of green spaces and increasing the largest patch percentage of green space. Vegetation type (trees, shrubs and herbaceous layers) and lack of management (pruning, irrigation and fertilization) has been shown to affect a higher capacity to provide the ecosystem services of air purification and climate regulation within green urban spaces. The types of plants and shrubs are important because areas with large tree canopies can actually contribute to asthma and allergic sensitization.  Mechanism of Urban Open Space Health Effects  Access to urban open space encourages physical activity and reduces ambient air pollution, heat, traffic noise and emissions. All are factors which contribute to the risks of chronic disease and mental illness. Individuals and families who lived closer to ‚Äòformal‚Äô parks or open space were more likely to achieve the recommended amounts of physical activity. Better respiratory health is associated with cleaner air quality. Cleaner air quality affects rates of chronic disease in populations exposed. ‚ÄúHigh concentrations of ambient particles can trigger the onset of acute myocardial infarction and increase hospitalization for cardiovascular disease‚Äù. Besides an association with lower BMI/obesity rates, this physical activity can increase lung function and be a protective factor against respiratory disease. Impacts on mental health The advocacy for mental health is becoming increasingly rampant, given the psychiatric illnesses that contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality in the United States. Health disparities existing within and amongst communities make this issue of paramount importance. The correlation between psychological distress and socioeconomic status (SES) has previously been examined. Sugiyama demonstrates that psychological distress is positively correlated with lower SES. A contributing factor to this socioeconomic disparity is the higher amounts of green space among residents with higher SES. Access to and active utilization of urban green space results in decreased rates of anxiety and depression, which are among the most common mental health illnesses. The positive association between mental health and green space was also supported by Van den Berg. The positive influence of urban green space on a community's perceived sense of mental wellness is achieved through uplifted moods, decreased stress levels, relaxation, recuperation, and increased human contact, which in itself promotes mental well-being. Given the burden of mental illness in the United States, it is important to examine the impact of urban green space on mental health and utilize this information to promote mental well-being across communities. Modern research evidence demonstrates urban green space has positive impacts on population level mental health. Evidence shows that designated green space in urban areas facilitates social interaction, fosters well-being, increases opportunities for exercise, and contributes to improvement in common mental health problems such as anxiety, depression, and stress. One randomized trial studied two groups: one composed of residents living in a neighborhood that had a greening intervention and one that did not. Among the participants who now live in a green neighborhood, those feeling depressed decreased by 41.5% and self-reported poor mental health decreased by 62.8%. Another study indicates that \\"the difference in depressive symptoms between an individual living in an environment with no tree canopy and an environment with tree canopy is larger than the difference in symptoms associated between individuals who are uninsured compared with individuals with private insurance\\". Incorporating green space into urban design is an impactful, equitable, affordable, and accessible way to decrease the burden of mental health. Further research on urban open spaces have recently found a positive link associating a mental health and well-being with increased access to green spaces in urban areas. The RESIDE Project, for example, has found a dose-response effect where the total area of public green spaces is associated with a greater overall wellbeing. Based on the study participants' survey responses, urban neighborhoods with more access to green spaces are more likely to report increased optimism, perception of usefulness, confidence, social interaction, and interest in new activities. Additionally, individuals living in neighborhoods within walking distance of parks have more opportunities to participate in recreational activities which is also associated with positive health outcomes. Another study published in the Journal of Epidemiology compared the effect of green spaces on 2,169 pairs of twins. After adjusting for genetic confounders and childhood environments, researchers found significant association between green spaces and decreased depression. Both examples of green spaces in urban areas illustrate how individual's environment can affect mental health and highlight the importance of access to green spaces. Furthermore, there are several strategies that policymakers have pursued in order to increase the amount of green space in urban areas. Two are explored here: a case study in Toronto's redevelopment of Brownfield sites, and a broad analysis of city-wide planning strategies. Impacts on high temperatures Urban areas tend to have higher temperatures than their surrounding undeveloped areas because of Urban Heat Islands, UHIs. Urban heat islands are areas with man-made infrastructure that contribute to the increased temperatures . The average temperature during the day in cities can be 18-27 degrees Fahrenheit higher than in the surrounding rural regions . This is an example of one type of UHI, surface heat islands. Surface heat islands encompass the area from the ground to the top of the tree-line. It is usually higher during the day when direct sunlight reaches urban structures (often with darker materials than natural areas) including the main contributor, pavement. The other type of UHI, atmospheric heat islands, are from above the tree-line to the level in the atmosphere where the urban area no longer has an effect. This type of heat island has increased heat at night due to the release of heat from infrastructure that built up throughout the day . Green spaces within urban areas can help reduce these increased temperatures through shading and evapotranspiration. Shading comes from the taller plants, such as trees, planted in green spaces that can contribute to lowering the surface heat island effect. The shade provides protection from the sun for vulnerable populations, such as children, during periods of increased temperature, during the summer months or during a heat wave. Tree cover prevents some solar radiation from reaching the ground with its leaves and branches . This reduces the effect of surface urban heat islands. Open spaces that include any type of vegetation help offset the high temperatures through the natural process of evapotranspiration. Evapotranspiration releases water into the air therefore dissipating heat. There are many elements of an urban open space that can contribute to the mitigation of urban heat islands including the type of open space (park or nature reserve), type of plant species, and the density of vegetation. Green spaces contribute to the reduction of local heat, decreasing the overall effect of UHIs. The larger the distribution of green spaces, the bigger the area of heat reduction. Green spaces that are clustered together will have an additive heat reduction resulting in a greater decrease in temperature in the local area compared to surrounding areas. Impacts on air quality Human activity has increased air pollution in the earth's atmosphere and trees play an essential role in removing human-made pollutants from the air, aka particulate matter (PM). Trees produce oxygen and absorb CO2. In urban green spaces, trees filter out man-made pollutants. Air quality data collected on cities with and without urban green space has shown that areas with an abundance of trees have considerably less air pollutants, i.e. O3, PM10, NO2, SO2, and CO. As air pollutants accumulate in the atmosphere, vulnerable populations, such as children, may suffer from increased incidences of respiratory disease. Particulate matter or particle pollution with a diameter of 10 microns (PM10) or 2.5 microns (PM2.5) is associated with heart diseases and respiratory diseases including lung cancer. Globally, particulate matter has increased over 28% in indoor air and 35% in outdoor air. Children spend most of their time at school, around 10 hours daily, and the indoor and outdoor air has a large impact on their health. Schools located in urban areas have higher particulate matter than schools in rural areas. Compared with children in schools located in rural areas, children who attend schools located in industrial areas and urban cities have higher levels of urinary PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) metabolites, which is linked to air pollution. There are two different ways that green spaces can reduce the pollution of particulate matter including preventing distribution of particulate from pollutants or by reducing the particulate matter from traveling to other places. There is a disagreement about the association of living near green spaces or having high exposure to greenness and illness such as allergies, rhinitis, and eye and nose symptoms. Higher exposure to tree canopy and pollen was associated with a high risk of prevalence rhinitis, allergic sensitization, wheezing, and asthma among children 7 years-old. More studies are needed to explain the effect of urban green spaces on children relating to air quality. These studies should take into consideration the interconnectedness of tree species, geographic areas, temperature, and other pollutant-like traffic. Case study: redevelopment of brownfield sites Brownfield sites are defined as \\"abandoned, idled, or under-used industrial and commercial facilities where expansion or redevelopment is complicated by real or perceived environmental contamination.\\" The City of Toronto undertook an extensive redevelopment of Brownfield sites into green spaces starting in the 1950s. The first step was motivation. In 1954, Hurricane Hazel hit the city and caused considerable damage. The city subsequently obtained \\"flood lands\\" as a buffer to protect against future hurricanes. Later, there was an impetus to convert contaminated brownfields into greenspace for the perceived benefits, the top reasons being the creation of ecological habitats and to provide recreational opportunities. After establishing the motivation, the second step was to conduct a survey of all the Brownfield sites. Although the City of Toronto was responsible for the management of Brownfield sites, they had limited resources to do so. They began by taking an inventory of all the land that could be considered Brownfields. By contrast, the greenspace is much more actively managed by both the City of Toronto and the Toronto Region Conservation Authority. Over 12% of the urban land in Toronto is classified as green space. The third step involved holding meetings with both public and private stakeholders. Including the local neighborhood in the decision making process was seen as key to securing the cooperation of the public. Because there was little perceived economic gain by private stakeholders, the redevelopment project was largely carried out by the public sector. The fourth step was delegation. A single department was put in charge of the project, which in this case was the municipal government's Parks Department (the government absorbed 90-100% of the implementation costs). It was expected that implementation would take several years after delegation ‚Äì in this case, redevelopment took between 3‚Äì5 years for each individual site. The fifth step was collaboration with other government agencies. Government agencies that shared land in common with the municipal government, such as flood plains and waterfronts, negotiated with each other in order to ensure the concurrency of the goals between the various agencies and Toronto's redevelopment efforts. A sixth step involved the acquisition of private land, which was either donated or purchased by the city. It is important to recognize that a substantial amount of Brownfield sites may reside on private land, and that a city must legally acquire it in order to implement redevelopment. The seventh step assessed each site individually. Because the sites were contaminated to different degrees, specific cleanup criteria were determined for each site, with various remediation strategies for each. The most common method was to cap (bury) the contaminants in situ. None of this could have happened unless there was a prerequisite zeroth step: creating an atmosphere of high trust. The City of Toronto was trusted by its citizens, and that trust enabled the city to redevelop Brownfield sites. The public sector was expected to do its job and to prevent people using the new green space from being exposed to contaminants. CITY-WIDE GREEN SPACE PLANNING: The concept that ecosystems provide services that improve quality of life for city residents is becoming more and more recognized. With that recognition, a shift in understanding green space from being an aesthetic contribution to city beautification to an essential part of the urban center is occurring. However, city planners are increasingly faced with densification and population increase in urban centers. This places stress on existing green spaces and can inhibit the creation of new green spaces. Interestingly, per capita GDP was found to be positively correlated with the amount of green space coverage. This suggests that economic systems that facilitate the accumulation of wealth can provision a city with increased green space. This must be balanced with the finding that greening efforts in low income sections of a city can cause rents to rise and make housing less affordable there. Additionally, it was found that European cities that distributed the management of green space among several governmental agencies were less successful in green space planning compared to cities with only one agency responsible. Lack of public awareness about the value of urban green space can also lead to less stakeholder contribution to green space planning. This suggests that public education can lead the population to more fully participate as informed stakeholders to a much greater extent. Additionally, improvement in the quality of green space can be pursued when no additional green space can be added. Furthermore, the concept of \\"green fingers,\\" can be implemented in city-wide planning in order to optimize green space geometry. \\"Green fingers\\" is a strategy that connects urban green space from the city center to the periphery, thereby linking the rural to the urban in a continuous fashion and enabling better resident access. Developing green roofs, gardens, and facades may be appropriate strategies for private land and buildings, but these cannot fulfill the functions of a public green space. Nevertheless they provide valuable contributions to resident quality of life, and can be supported by various tax beak incentives. Finally, heritage green space sites can be protected by various laws and regulations. All in all, the implementation of urban green space strategies must consider the entire urban region in question in order to achieve the overarching goal to provide urban residents with a higher quality of life. While the current research on the impacts of green space of mental health appears broad, the future of green space is still of utmost importance. Many US cities have unique plans to address this issue, while others are already experiencing the effects of reduced greenspace. Denver, for example, once boasted a meager 20% of the city having been paved or built-over in the mid-1970s. However, this number could reach closer to 70% by 2040 due to an explosion of the city's population. The hyper-functionality of modern-day cities must also be able to exist in a way that portrays beauty in the infrastructure itself. One proposed solution to this involves shifting grey infrastructure made of concrete towards green infrastructure that looks less industrial and more like an ecosystem. This proposal, brought forth by the California Center for Sustainable Communities, accompanies another idea that cities should assess green space initiatives based on their cultural and natural assets. For example, Cairns, Australia embraces \\"tropical urbanism\\" as the basis for its green space landscape throughout the city, while Salt Lake City describes its future parks as \\"mountain urbanism\\". One study found that there was not a significant association between the amount of green space in residents' local areas and mental wellbeing, suggesting that the quality of green space may be what matters most. Ultimately, improving the quality of green space is a main concern for cities of the future and acting on a city's cultural and natural strengths is the best method to achieve this.  In times of the COVID-19 pandemic  During the COVID-19 pandemic, more people began to visit parks. It helped them to fight the mental distress caused by the pandemic and other social issues. Vulnerable Populations Urban areas have greatly expanded and resulted in over half of the world's population to be located in urban locations. As the population continues to grow, this number is predicted to be at two-thirds of people living in urban areas by 2050 . =Children= Impacts on physical health The adolescent years are extremely important for children due to it being a time of growth, development, and instillation of habits. When children are given the opportunity to be active, they typically take advantage of it. Children with a greater access to parks and recreational facilities through urban green space have been found to be more active than children who lack access. The access to green spaces has shown an association with recreational walking, increased physical activity, and reduced sedentary time in all ages. In coordination, it has been seen that higher residential green space is associated with lower BMI scores. If children are given the opportunity to be active and maintain a healthy BMI in their adolescent years, they are less likely to be obese as adults. Impacts on mental health Children exposed to urban green spaces have the opportunity to expend energy by interacting with their environment and other people through exercise. One study has shown that without access to urban green spaces, some children have problems with hyperactivity, peer interactions, and good conduct. The important interactions with nature, animals, and peers have been positively influential in child development and reduction in behavioral issues such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Urban green spaces allow children to expel their extra energy and improve their ability to focus when needed both at school and home. In addition to behavioral problems, and likely connected, access to urban green space has been proven to be helpful for cognitive development. With urban green space giving children the opportunity to get outside and expend energy, children are more focused in school and have a better working memory and reduced inattentiveness. Another facet of urban green space improving mental health is giving children access to a community. Recreational activities and playing at the park gives children opportunities to interact with other children and develop a social circle and social skills in general. Children with a good social network feel socially included, promoting more confidence and well-being in their everyday lives. Overall, the bonding experiences that result from urban green spaces tie in with a child's cognitive and social development. A 2020 study suggested that increased access to urban green space increased the IQ of children by 2.6 points. (around 3 % on average)Bijnens EM, Derom C, Thiery E, Weyers S, Nawrot TS (2020) Residential green space and child intelligence and behavior across urban, suburban, and rural areas in Belgium: A longitudinal birth cohort study of twins. PLoS Med 17(8): e1003213. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003213 History =Ancient Rome= The term \\"rus in urbe\\" meaning \\"country in the city\\" was used in Rome around the first century C.E. Urban planning in Rome valued the natural landscape and took account for environmental factors. It was thought that by building a city with regard to the local countryside, the people living there would be healthier and happier. English landscapes would later take inspiration from Roman urban planning concepts in their own open spaces. =London= London has a long history of urban open space, which has significantly influenced development of modern parks, and is still among the greenest capital cities in the world. The basis for many urban open spaces seen today across Europe and the West began its process of development in London in the 17th and 18th centuries. What would eventually become urban open green space began as paved public plazas. Though they were intended to be open to the public, these spaces began to be re-designated as private parks around the late eighteenth century. It was during this period that the areas became pockets of green in the urban environment, commonly modelled after the natural wild of the countryside. The first parks to reverse the trend of privatization and again be opened to the public were England's royal parks in the nineteenth century. This was done in response to the extensive and unexpected population movement from the country into cities. As a result, \\"the need for open space was socially and politically pressing‚Ä¶ The problems, to which the provision of parks was expected to offer some relief, were easy to describe: overcrowding, poverty, squalor, ill-health, lack of morals and morale, and so on\\". Such sentiments again received significant popular support during the \\"City Beautiful\\" movement in America during the 1890s and 1900s. Both trends focused on providing the public an opportunity to receive all of the perceived health and lifestyle benefits of having access to open space within urban environments. Current trends Segmentation of urban open spaces was particularly prominent in America during the twentieth century. Since the late 1800s romantic park systems, open space designers have been concerned with guiding, containing or separating urban growth, distributing recreation, and/or producing scenic amenity, mostly within the framework of geometric abstractions.\\"Roberts, William H. \\"Design of Metropolitan Open Space Based on Natural Process.\\" Metropolitan Open Space and Natural Process. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania, 1970. Such segmentation was especially prominent in the 1990s, when urban open spaces took a path similar to that of parks, following the modernization trend of segmentation and specialization of areas.Young, Terence. \\"Modern Urban Parks.\\" Geographical Review 1995. Pp 535‚Äì551 As modernity stressed \\"increased efficiency, quantifiablity, predictability, and control‚Ä¶ In concert with the additional social divisions\\", open spaces grew more specific in purpose. Perhaps this increase in division of social classes' use of open space, demonstrated by the segmentation of the spaces, displays a situation similar to the privatization of London parks in the eighteenth century, which displayed a desire to make classes more distinct. Today, places like Scandinavia, which do not have a significant history of outdoor recreation and gathering places, are seeing a proliferation of urban open spaces and adopting a lifestyle supported by the extra urban breathing room. An example of this can be seen in Copenhagen where an area closed to car traffic in 1962 developed, in just a few decades, a culture of public political gatherings and outdoor cafes emerged.Gehl, Jan. \\"Public Spaces for a Changing Public Life.\\" Open Space People Space. Ed. Catharine Ward Thompson and Penny Travlou. London: Taylor and Francis, 2007. Not only is appreciation for and use of urban open spaces flourishing in locations that historically lacked such traditions, the number of urban open spaces is increasing rapidly as well. Non-sustainable gardening, including mowing, use of chemical fertilisers, herbicides and pesticides harm green spaces Alumai, Alfred. \\"Urban Lawn Management: Addressing the Entomological, Agronomic, Economic, and Social Drivers.\\" PhD., Ohio State University, 2008.. Contrarywise, one of the conditions for good urban open space is sustainable gardening.  Inequalities  Green space access is related to health inequality for minority populations. Neighborhoods with higher percentages of minority residents often have lower access to open space and parks as the result of past red-lining policies and current inequities in funding priorities. Urban open space is under strong pressure. Due to increasing urbanization, combined with a spatial planning policy of densification, more people face the prospect of living in less green residential environments, especially people from low economic strata. This may cause environmental inequality with regard to the distribution of (access) to public green space. The parks that do exist in minority neighborhoods are often small (with lower acreage per person than parks in majority ethnicity neighborhoods), not well maintained, unsafe, or are otherwise ill-suited for community needs. A large epidemiological study. concluded that wealthier individuals were generally healthier than individuals with a lower income, explained by the pattern that wealthier individuals reside in areas more concentrated with green space. Urban open spaces in higher socioeconomic neighborhoods were also more likely to have trees that provided shade, a water feature (e.g. pond, lake and creek), walking and cycling paths, lighting, signage regarding dog access and signage restricting other activities as well. This difference in access has been proven, however, further study is needed to evaluate the exact health impacts. A study conducted in Australia provided insight into how there is a correlation between community development/community safety and natural open space within the community. Open areas allow community members to engage in highly social activities and facilitate the expansion of social networks and friendship development. As people become more social they decrease the perceptions of fear and mistrust allowing a sense of community bondage. Distant or lack of adequate green space, therefore, may contribute to higher rates of inactivity and greater health effects among minority populations. = Green gentrification = See also *Open space reserve *Green belt *Greenway (landscape) * Park *Principles of Intelligent Urbanism * Village green References Further reading Open space Open space Greenways Urban Protected areas Zoning ","title":"Urban green space"},{"id":"20623124","text":"Max Delvalle Levy-Maduro (February 27, 1911 ‚Äì December 20, 1979) was a Panamanian politician who served as vice president from 1964 to 1968 and briefly served as acting president in 1967.

This novel, written in the form of an allegory, tells the story of the town \\"Mansoul\\" (Man's soul). Though this town is perfect and bears the image of Shaddai (Almighty), it is deceived to rebel and throw off his gracious rule, replacing it instead with the rule of Diabolus. Though Mansoul has rejected the Kingship of Shaddai, he sends his son Emmanuel to reclaim it. Allegory The Spiritual Warfare (c1623), a print by Martin Droeshout depicting the devil's army besieging a walled city held by a \\"Christian Soldier bold\\" guarded by figures representing the Christian virtues. It has been suggested that this print may have influenced Bunyan to write The Holy War.Jones, Malcolm, \\"The English Print\\", in Hattaway, Michael, A Companion to English Renaissance Literature and Culture, John Wiley & Sons, 2008, p.360.Zinck, Arlette, \\"Dating The Spiritual Warfare Broadsheet\\", The Recorder: Newsletter of the International John Bunyan Society, 2007, pp.3-4. In the city there were three esteemed men, who, by admitting Diabolus to the city, lost their previous authority. The eyes of \\"Understanding\\", the mayor, are hidden from the light. \\"Conscience\\", the recorder, has become a madman, at times sinning, and at other times condemning the sin of the city. But worst of all is \\"Lord Willbewill,\\" whose desire has been completely changed from serving his true Lord, to serving Diabolus. With the fall of these three, for Mansoul to turn back to Shaddai of their own will, is impossible. Salvation can come only by the victory of Emmanuel. The entire story is a masterpiece of Christian literature, describing vividly the process of the fall, conversion, fellowship with Emmanuel, and many more intricate doctrines. Characters The main characters are in order of importance are: *SHADDAI: The Sovereign of the Universe (El Shaddai is one of the Judaic names of God). Also the builder and creator of Mansoul, whose image it bears. *EMMANUEL: The son of Shaddai, who lead the campaign to reclaim Mansoul. *THE SECRETARY: One who is equal to Shaddai and Emmanuel, who resides in Mansoul after the victorious conquest of Emmanuel. *DIABOLUS: The deceiver whose crafty lies prompted the fall of Mansoul, and who holds the city against the conquest of Emmanuel. *ILL-PAUSE: The servant of Diabolus whose foulness slays Lord Innocency. *UNDERSTANDING: The first and final Mayor of Mansoul, whose treachery to Shaddai, causes him not to see the light. *CONSCIENCE: The first and final Recorder of Mansoul. Whose sin causes him to forget Shaddai's law at times, and at other times to bewail the sin of Mansoulians. *LORD WILLBEWILL: A servant of Shaddai at the first, who shifts his allegiance to Diabolus at the capture of the city. *INCREDULITY: A friend of Diabolus and one of the two mayors under his rule, who escapes execution after the recapture of Mansoul and who leads the army of Doubters against it. *LUSTING: A Diabolian who also was a Mayor under Diabolus. *FORGET-GOOD: The recorder under Diabolus, who completely despises the law of Shaddai. *BOANERGES: One of the four first Captains sent by Shaddai against Mansoul. *CONVICTION: The second Captain. *JUDGEMENT: The third Captain. *EXECUTION: The fourth Captain. *CREDENCE: One of the five Captains to come with Emmanuel, to join the siege of Mansoul (The fifth Captain). *GOOD-HOPE: The sixth Captain. *CHARITY: The seventh Captain. *INNOCENCE: The eighth Captain. *PATIENCE: The ninth Captain. *CARNAL-SECURITY: The entrapping Diabolian, who causes Mansoul to break fellowship with Emmanuel after He had so graciously saved the city. Locations Some of the main places are listed below. *MANSOUL: The town, built for the glory and enjoyment of Shaddai, who in its wickedness forsakes their King for Diabolus. *EYE-GATE: One of the most significant of the five gates entering into Mansoul. *EAR-GATE: Also one of the most significant gates entering into Mansoul, it is the one which is first assaulted by Diabolus. *MOUTH-GATE: The Gate where proclamations are read and petitions sent. *FEEL-GATE: A weakly guarded gate where Diabolus sends the Doubters attack after Emmanuel had reclaimed the city. *NOSE-GATE: The least of the five gates of Mansoul. *HELL-GATE HILL: The place where Diabolus initially flees after losing possession of Mansoul.

The school is located at Gammel Skivevej 2 in Viborg and supports about 1000 students.  History  The Katedralskole was established around 1060 as a Catholic seminary. Young men were schooled in Bible reading, hymn singing, prayers and Latin. The school's rector was appointed by the bishop and simultaneously served as a priest in one of Viborg's twelve local churches. After the Protestant Reformation in 1536, the school became regulated by the Danish monarchy. In 1772 the school moved to Sct. Mogens Gade 1, while the original structure was rebuilt to hold an increased number of students and teachers. The school was later landscaped with a garden as a result of a fire in the area around the school. The garden is known as the Latin Garden. The old school and the Latin Garden lie near Viborg Cathedral. The 1800s saw a series of school reforms: a library was established and subjects were taught in Danish. In 1903 a national law in Denmark was introduced that allowed girls admittance to gymnasiums, and in 1904 Katedralskole became coeducational. The architect Hack Kampmann started work in 1922 on an additional school building. Kampmann died before the building was completed, so his son, architect Christian Kampmann, completed the project in 1926. The school, which is preserved, now lies on the corner of Skivevej and Aalborgvej. The exterior of the present school building is constructed in the Neoclassical style with a Scandinavian modern interior.

It is a houbara bustard subspecies which is endemic to the eastern Canary archipelago, in Macaronesia in the North Atlantic Ocean, where it is a scarce and threatened non-migratory resident. It is the animal symbol of the island of Fuerteventura. Taxonomy The Canarian houbara is one of three subspecies of the houbara bustard. Archaeological evidence indicates that it has been present in the Canary Islands for 130‚Äì170,000 years. However, genetic data point to a more recent separation of C. u. fuertaventurae from the nominate subspecies around 20‚Äì25,000 years ago. It suggests that there was an initial colonisation of the Canary Islands about 130,000 years ago, followed by a second colonisation 19-30 000 years ago, with subsequent isolation until today. Description The Canarian houbara is distinguished from the other two subspecies by its smaller size, less sandy colouring, and darker and more extensive markings on the back.Heredia, Borja. (Compiler). (1995). Action Plan for the Houbara Bustard in the Canary Islands. BirdLife International. Retrieved on 16 December 2008. It is the largest bird native to the Canary Islands.Iberia Nature: Houbara Bustard Distribution and habitat Houbaras are restricted to the islands of Fuerteventura, Lobos, Lanzarote and Graciosa, though it is uncertain as to whether they continue to exist on Lobos. In the past, they also inhabited the islands of Tenerife and Gran Canaria, where they are now extinct.Un nuevo yacimiento de vertebrados f√≥siles en Tenerife (Islas Canarias) Annual rainfall in their range is less than while mean monthly temperatures range between in January‚ÄìFebruary and in August‚ÄìSeptember. They inhabit semi-arid plains, rocky hills and immobile dunes, sparsely vegetated with bushes and grasses. They will sometimes feed in farmland in the early morning and at dusk, but avoid human settlements, cornfields, forests and lava flows. Behaviour =Breeding= On Lanzarote, Canary Islands, Spain Outside the breeding season the birds may be gregarious and forage in small parties. However, when breeding, males hold and defend individual territories for courtship display some 500‚Äì1000 m across. During this period both sexes tend to be solitary, only coming together for mating. Courtship takes place from December to March with the male displaying his head and throat plumage while strutting in a line or circle. The female lays two or three eggs in a scrape on the ground between February and April. Males are probably polygynous and do not help to rear the young. The chicks are nidifugous and accompany the female after hatching. Usually only one chick survives from each clutch, rarely two. =Feeding= The birds are omnivorous, feeding on the ground and consuming a variety of arthropods, molluscs and smaller vertebrates as well as plant material. The chicks require insects in order to grow properly. Status and conservation Israeli postal stamp, 1963 The Action Plan published in 1995 estimated the total population of Canarian houbaras at about 700‚Äì750 birds, comprising 300‚Äì350 on Fuerteventura and Lobos, and 400 on Lanzarote and Graciosa. However a later study estimated the number of birds on Fuerteventura at 177.Carrascal, Luis M.; Palomino, David; Seoane, Javier; & Alonso, C√©sar L. (2008).

(4) The Russian plural pirogi with the stress on the last syllable should not be confused with pierogi (stress on \\"o\\" in Polish and English) in Polish cuisine, which are similar to the Russian pelmeni or Ukrainian varenyky. Shape Pirogi come in different shapes and forms: they are often oblong with tapering ends, but can also be circular or rectangular.Stechishin, S. (1989). Traditional Ukrainian Cookery. Trident Press, Canada. They can be closed or open-faced with no crust on top. Dough Pirogi are usually made from yeast-raised dough which distinguishes them from pies and pastries common in other cuisines. In former times, the dough for Russian pirogi was made predominantly of rye flour. Later it was mixed with wheat flour. Nowadays, mainly wheat flour is used. There are also variants made from shortcrust, flaky or puff pastry. In East-Slavic languages pirog is a generic term which denotes virtually any kind of pie, pastry, or cake. –¢hus, Karelian pastry (known as Karelian pirog in Russian), knish or charlotte are considered types of pirog in Eastern Europe. Filling The filling for pirogi may be sweet and contain quark or cottage cheese, fruits like apples, plums or various berries, as well as honey, nuts or poppy seeds. Savory versions may consist of meat, fish, mushrooms, cabbage, rice, buckwheat groats, or potato. In Ukrainian and Russian cuisines, pirogi (as well as their smaller versions called pirozhki) with a savory filling are traditionally served as an accompaniment with clear borscht, broth, or consomm√©.

According to Mineo, the arresting police officers pinned him to the ground, while Richard Kern, one of the officers, pulled down Mineo's pants and sodomized him with a police baton. On December 9, 2008, the Brooklyn District Attorney indicted the three arresting officers and charged them with felonies. Kern was charged with aggravated sexual abuse in the first degree, assault in the first degree, and hindering prosecution. Two other officers ‚Äî Andrew Morales and Alex Cruz ‚Äî were charged with hindering prosecution and official misconduct. All three officers were tried and found not guilty of all charges.  Background  Michael Mineo was born in either Flatbush or in Dallas, Texas. He is Italian-Puerto Rican. Both of his parents died of drug overdoses when he was around eleven years old. He then moved in with his mother's parents, but they both died by the time he was fourteen. He then moved in with an aunt by marriage and her husband who lived in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Mineo was under indictment on felony assault charges stemming from an unrelated incident for which he was arrested on April 18, 2008. Mineo's defense for his indictment was a legal aid attorney, but following the alleged incident on October 15 he hired a private attorney. In the fall of 2003, Mineo stole his friend's mother's credit cards and placed more than $6,000 on the card. During that time, he left for New York City; soon thereafter he was arrested on marijuana possession and was found to be carrying the stolen credit cards. In 2007, New York City paid out $50,000 to settle two excessive force lawsuits filed against Richard Kern. However, the Civilian Complaint Review Board cleared him of wrongdoing and Kern says the excessive force claims were a \\"complete lie\\".  Incident  On October 15, 2008, Michael Mineo was allegedly smoking a marijuana joint outside the Prospect Park station in Flatbush. When approached by police officers, Mineo ran into the train station, jumped the turnstile, but was caught and handcuffed near the token booth. According to the officers, they found no drugs on him, issued him a summons for disorderly conduct, and let him go. According to Mineo, after he was handcuffed and pinned down, Richard Kern pulled down his pants and shoved a police radio antenna into his anus. Mineo later changed his version to a police baton. On October 23, Mineo's attorneys announced the incident and noted that they planned to file a lawsuit against New York City on Mineo's behalf. Speaking before a grand jury in November 2008, Transit Police officer Kevin Maloney testified that police officer Richard Kern jabbed Mineo's buttocks with a police baton, while other witnesses testified that Mineo's bare buttocks were visible and that they heard him screaming: \\"Don't shove a walkie [talkie] up my ass!\\" Mineo later praised the Transit Police officer who had testified on his behalf stating \\"I'm really happy he came out and said what he said. He must have felt bad.\\" Maloney testified that he saw Kern resting his baton on Mineo's left buttock, and he saw half inch to an inch disappear from view. Michael Mineo was hospitalized two times with what sources described as \\"rectal tears\\" as a result of the assault. This case has drawn parallels to a similar set of circumstances that took place in August 1997, in which NYPD officers assaulted and forcibly sodomized Abner Louima with a broken plunger handle after he was arrested. However, there are differences between the Louima and Mineo situations. Louima was black and his 1997 police attackers were white, whereas Mineo is described as white and Hispanic and the involved police officers are white, black and Hispanic.  Criticism  The NYPD was criticized for not taking Mineo's claims seriously. The accused officers were kept on regular patrol duty for two and half weeks after the incident. The police maintain that they aggressively located records, reviewed hours of videotape, examined MetroCard records, and retained equipment for DNA testing.  Trial  The trial of the three police officers began on January 22, 2010. The prosecution called Mineo, another police officer who witnessed the incident, a doctor who treated Mineo, and a DNA expert from the medical examiner's office. The defense followed by calling each of the three officers, and a doctor who stated the injuries were not consistent with assault. The defense submitted a video as evidence that supports the argument that Mineo had a pre-existing medical condition. During the jury deliberations, one juror was removed because she misinformed the other jurors regarding past allegations against Kern. The removed juror was replaced with an alternate. After a couple of days of deliberating, the jury found the three police officers not guilty. The jury stated to the judge that they had reasonable doubt regarding the incident.

In the British Airways‚Äô case, the organizations‚Äô servers appeared to have been compromised directly, with the attackers modifying one of the JavaScript files (Modernizr JavaScript library, version 2.6.2) to include a PII/credit card logging script that would grab the payment information and send the information to the server controlled by the attacker hosted on ‚Äú[.]com‚Äù domain with an SSL certificate issued by ‚ÄúComodo‚Äù Certificate Authority. The British Airways mobile application also loads a webpage built with the same CSS and JavaScript components as the main website, including the malicious script installed by Magecart. Thus, the payments made using the British Airways mobile app were also affected. Countermeasures Due to the recent increase in keylogging and form grabbing, antivirus companies are adding additional protection to counter the efforts of key-loggers and prevent collecting passwords. These efforts have taken different forms varying from antivirus companies, such as safepay, password manager, and others. To further counter form grabbing, users' privileges can become limited which would prevent them from installing Browser Helper Objects (BHOs) and other form grabbing software. Administrators should create a list of malicious servers to their firewalls. New countermeasures, such as using Out-of-band communication, to circumvent form grabbers and Man-in-the-browser are also emerging; examples include FormL3SS. ; those that circumvent the threat use a different communication channel to send the sensitive data to the trusted server. Thus, no information is entered on the compromised device. Alternative Initiatives such as Fidelius use added hardware to protect the input/output to the compromised or believed compromised device.

Animal shelters often use the term BBD, or big black dog, to describe the type of larger dark-colored mixed- breed said to be typically passed over by adopters. Black cats are similarly reported to be subject to the same phenomenon. Theories The proposed phenomenon may be due to a number of factors. Research has identified geographic location, fear stigma against certain breed types, and the fact that large, black dogs are often portrayed as aggressive in film and on television as possible correlates. Initial research at one location identified a longer period experienced by black dogs before adoption, but subsequent studies considered to be more robust (as conducted in a larger number of geographically spread shelters) has shown that when shelter visitors video- recorded their walk through the adoption area, they spent equal amounts of time looking at every dog, regardless of coat color. Other studies have suggested brindle dogs may be more likely to experience longer delays before adoption than black dogs. Coat color bias seems evident, but may change depending on geographic location. Some people believe that during the pet adoption process some potential owners associate the color black with evil or misfortune (similar to the common superstition surrounding black cats), and this bias transfers over to their choice of dog. Additionally, many shelters feature photo profiles of their dogs on the shelter website. Because black dogs do not photograph well, lighter-colored dogs have an advantage with potential adopters browsing the site. A study done by the Los Angeles Animal Services challenges some of these claims, saying that a full 28% of adopted dogs are black. However, the bias theory simply asserts that predominantly dark animals take longer to be adopted than their lighter counterparts, and that large dogs take longer to adopt than small ones. However, appearance in general does play a role in potential adopters' selection of shelter dogs. In a 2011 study by the ASPCA, appearance was the most frequently cited reason for adopters of both puppies (29 percent) and adult dogs (26 percent).Why Did You Choose Your Pet? April, 2011 History The issue has been gaining media attention since the mid-2000s. Tamara Delaney, an early activist against black dog syndrome, developed a website called Black Pearl Dogs in 2004 specifically to address the issue, both by educating the public about its existing, as well as showcasing individual dogs available for adoption. Scientific studies While many shelter workers claim the phenomenon is real, its acceptance is disputed, and quantitative analyses are limited. =Shelter studies= A 1992 article in the journal Animal Welfare, found that color was not a major factor in adoptions at a Northern Ireland shelter; black-and-white coats were most prevalent among adopted dogs, followed by yellow, solid black, gold, and black-and-tan coats. However, this did not take into account what percentage of the shelter populations had those colors to begin with, and thus says nothing about the chances of an individual dog of a particular color being adopted, compared to a dog of another color. A 1998 study of 1,468 relinquished dogs offered for adoption at a local humane society found having a primarily black coat color was a variable associated with euthanasia, while gold, gray, and white coats colors were significant predictors of successful adoption. A 2002 study published in the Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science of dog and cat adoption in California animal shelters found pure-black coat colors to be negative factors in adoption rates for both dogs and cats. In 2008 the general manager of the Los Angeles Animal Services department reported that twelve months of data on the intake of 30,046 dogs showed slightly more dogs that were predominantly or all black were adopted than dogs who were not predominantly or all black. A 2010 PhD thesis analyzing multiple factors found a measurable variance contributing to dogs with primarily black coats being euthanized rather than adopted. A 2013 study of dogs' length of stay (LOS) at two New York \\"no-kill\\" shelters determined that canine coat color had no effect. The study noted that coat color's effect on LOS may be localized, or may not generalize to traditional or other types of shelters. A Masters thesis analysis of 16,800 dogs at two Pacific Northwest shelters found that black dogs were adopted more quickly than average at both shelters. A 2013 study of cat adoption rates published in The Open Veterinary Science Journal concluded that \\"Results indicated that black cats, regardless of age or sex, require the longest time to adopt. They are followed by primarily black cats with other colors.\\" =Studies based on images= A 1992 article in the journal Animal Welfare was conducted on adoptable dog characteristics. Participants in South Belfast were presented with photographs of dogs similar except for one manipulated feature, resulting in a statistically reliable preference for a blond coat (65%) over a black coat. A 2012 report in the journal Society and Animals on a pair of studies recording participant rankings of pictured dogs of varying attributes along eight different personality traits did not find a bias against black dogs. In the first study, using four types of poodles (large black, small black, large white, and small white), 795 participants ranked black poodles as more friendly than white poodles. A second study with eight different breeds, including a black lab, suggested that the personality ratings of participants was based more on stereotypes of breed than on color. It concluded that \\"in general, with the exception of the golden retriever, black labs were perceived as consistently less dominant and less hostile than other large breeds, contrary to the assumption that large, black dogs are viewed negatively. A 2013 study published in the journal Anthrozo√∂s displayed photographs of dogs colored either yellow or black, and with floppy ears or pointy ears. It found that ‚Äúparticipants rated the yellow dog significantly higher than the black dog on the personality dimensions of Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Emotional Stability.‚Äù It also found significant difference in ratings based on ear size, indicating ‚Äúthat people attribute different personality characteristics to dogs based solely on physical characteristics of the dog.‚Äù A study presented at the 2013 International Society for Anthrozoology conference that showed participants pictures of cats and dogs of varying colors found white cats were considered the friendliest, orange cats second friendliest, and black cats least friendly. Among dogs, yellow dogs were considered friendliest, brown dogs second friendliest, and black dogs least friendly. Darker pets were similarly judged less adoptable, and black dogs were considered the most aggressive.

It was created in 1913 by the British Monotype Corporation for their hot metal typesetting system, and is loosely based on a Gros Cicero face cut in the 16th century by Robert Granjon and held in the collection of the Plantin-Moretus Museum of Antwerp. The intention behind the design of Plantin was to create a font with thicker letterforms than were often used at the time: previous type designers had reduced the weight of their fonts to make up for the effect of ink spread or to achieve a more elegant image, but by 1913 innovations in smoothing and coating paper had led to reduced ink spread.. In preparing the design Monotype engineering manager Frank Hinman Pierpont visited the Plantin-Moretus Museum, which provided him with a printed specimen. Plantin was one of the first Monotype Corporation revivals that was not simply a copy of a typeface already popular in British printing; it has proved popular since its release and has been digitised. It can in retrospect be seen to have paved the way for the many Monotype revivals of classic typefaces that followed in the 1920s and 30s. Plantin would later also be used as one of the main models for the creation of Times New Roman in the 1930s.. The Plantin family includes regular, light and bold weights, along with corresponding italics. Inspiration punches, the masters used to stamp matrices used to cast metal type, at the Plantin-Moretus Museum. Its unique collection of original sixteenth-century matrices and punches inspired the Plantin design. The Plantin-Moretus Museum in Antwerp, a visit to which provided source material for Plantin's design. At the time Plantin was released, Monotype's hot metal typesetting system, which cast new type for each printing job, was developing a reputation for practicality in trade and mass-market printing, but the designs offered by Monotype were relatively basic choices, such as a \\"modern\\" face, an \\"old style\\" and a Clarendon. It was suggested by James Moran and John Dreyfus that the existence of a c. 1910 family from the Shanks foundry known as \\"Plantin Old Style\\" may have been an inspiration. This was actually a bold design based on Caslon, with no connection to Plantin but it was also a design advertised as being highly legible, so Dreyfus suggests it may have prompted the choice of design and name. The Plantin-Moretus Museum, created in 1876 from Plantin's collection which had been preserved and added to by his successors, is notable as the world's largest collection of sixteenth century typefaces, leading Pierpont to visit it to research the topic. The Granjon font on which Pierpont's design was based was listed as one of the types used by the Plantin-Moretus Press beginning in the 17th century, long after Plantin had died and his press had been inherited by the Moretus family. (It has been reported that Plantin himself had used a few letters of the font to supplement another font, a Garamond, but H. D. L. Vervliet (2008) suggests that these may have been a set of slightly different custom sorts cut by Granjon.) Plantin was designed and engraved into metal at the Monotype factory in Salfords, Surrey, which was led by Pierpont and draughtsman Fritz Stelzer. Both were recruits to Monotype from the German printing industry. The choice to revive a French renaissance design was unusual for the time, since most British fine printers of the period preferred either Caslon or revivals of the fifteenth-century style of Nicolas Jenson (recognisable from the tilted 'e'), following the lead of William Morris's Golden Type, both of which Monotype would also develop revivals of. However, other revivals of Aldine/French renaissance typefaces followed from several hot metal typesetting companies in the following decades, including Monotype's own Poliphilus, Bembo and Garamond, Linotype's Granjon and Estienne and others, becoming very popular in book printing for body text. Design Old Style, a delicate reinterpretation of pre nineteenth-century printing styles that became popular in the late nineteenth century. While offering a version of it as one of their first faces, Monotype in creating Plantin aimed to offer a more solid design that would print clearly. The design for Plantin preserved the large x-height of Granjon's designs, but shortened the ascenders and descenders and enlarged the counters of the lowercase 'a' and 'e'. Not all the letters were Granjon's: the letters 'J', 'U' and 'W', not used in French in the sixteenth century, were not his, and a different 'a' in an eighteenth-century style had been substituted into the font by the time the specimen sheet was printed. The 1742 specimen of Claude Lamesle (notable for its printing quality) provides a specimen of the Granjon type in its original state. Mosley has close-up images of some characters of the face. Reception and usage Perpetua, Baskerville and Plantin. Times is most based on Plantin, but with the letters made taller and its appearance \\"modernised\\" by adding eighteenth- and nineteenth-century influences similar to Baskerville and Perpetua, in particular enhancing the stroke contrast. Fontshop, showing infant styles and the condensed \\"News\\" and \\"Headline\\" styles sold for newspapers. With its relatively robust, solid design compared to the Didone and \\"Modernised Old Style\\" faces popular in the early twentieth century (which Monotype already had made versions of), Plantin proved popular and was often particularly used by trade and newspaper printers using poor-quality paper in the metal type period and beyond. Monotype's advertising emphasised its popularity with advertisers, highlighting its use in the \\"Mrs Rawlins\\" series of adverts for washing starch.}} As the basic font is relatively dark on the page, Monotype offered a 'light' version as well as a bold, which Hugh Williamson describes as \\"particularly suitable for bookwork.\\" During the interwar period the face was adopted and popularized by Francis Meynell's Pelican Press and by C. W. Hobson's Cloister press, and also used occasionally by Cambridge University Press. A custom version, \\"Nonesuch Plantin\\" was also cut for Meynell's Nonesuch Press, one of the first fine printers to use Monotype machines, with extended ascenders and descenders on the lower-case. Type designer Walter Tracy noted that this changed the type's appearance to a surprising extent: \\"it look[s] not only more refined but as if it derived from another period: Fournier's, say [in the eighteenth century], not Granjon's.\\" It was appropriately used by the Bodley Head to print Meynell's autobiography. Monotype also created a condensed version, News Plantin, for The Observer in the late 1970s. An infant variety of the typeface also exists, with single- story versions of the letters 'a' and 'g' and a 'y' with two straight sides. The font was used as the signature font for ABC News from 1978 until 1999. In more recent usage, the magazine Monocle is set entirely in Plantin and Helvetica. Plantin was the basis for the general layout of Monotype's most successful typeface of all, Times New Roman. Times is similar to Plantin but \\"sharpened\\" or \\"modernised\\", with increased contrast (particularly resembling designs from the eighteenth and nineteenth century) and greater \\"sparkle\\". Allan Haley commented that Times New Roman \\"looks like Plantin on a diet.\\" Various unofficial digitisations (including simple knock-offs) and more complete adaptations of Plantin have been released. Galaxie Copernicus by Chester Jenkins and Kris Sowersby is an unofficial digitisation. Sowersby followed it up with a newspaper typeface, Tiempos, influenced by Times New Roman.

Wildericus Dei et Apostolicae Sedis Gratia Episcopus Viennensis S. R. I. Princeps, Sacrae. Caes. Maiestatis Consiliarius Intimus, Praepositus Spirensis &c.; Philipp Franz Wilderich Nepomuk (2 March 1739 ‚Äì 21 April 1810) was count of Walderdorf and the last prince-bishop of Speyer. Biography His reign was short, from 1797 until the secularization in 1803. It was unusual that during the secularization, Wilderich was able to live in the south wing of his official residence, the baroque palace in Bruchsal, until his death in 1810. When he was inaugurated in his office, there were already signs indicating that the dissolution of the old empire was at hand. On 22 April 1797, following the death of his predecessor August Philip of Limburg Stirum, Walderich, who was at that time the Domdechant of Trier, was installed as lord bishop of Speyer. Wilderich left few physical traces of construction in the Bruchsal palace. It was the little room north of the F√ºrstensaal, which the newly appointed bishop immediately arranged for his regency. The stuccoers had to use all their imagination and Walderich did not exactly make it easy for them. It was less the artistic design of space as much as the willfulness of the presentation, which Wilderich demanded. More so it was with the furniture with which they had to decorate the room. At the beginning of 1799 the French armies crossed the Rhine and by the Treaty of Lun√©ville of 9 February 1801, Emperor Francis II recognized the annexation to the French Republic of the entire left bank of the river, including the cathedral city of Speyer. Prince-bishop Wilderich who had fled the French advance returned to his palace at Bruchsal on 10 June 1801. However, in December of the following year, in the course of the German mediatization, what was left of the prince-bishopric on the right bank of the Rhine was secularized and became part of the newly created Principality of Bruchsal, now part of Baden, which began to establish an administration. The Bruchsal palace became the property of Baden. Bishop Walderich lost all his secular powers but retained his princely title. He was granted a pension of 200,000 florins and the right of residence in the Wagh√§usel Hermitage; in winter he could continue to live in a part of the former episcopal palace. From 1806 onward he lived next to the recently widowed Grand Duchess Amalie von Baden, who took up residence in the northern part of the palace.http://www.schloss- bruchsal.de/wissenswert-amuesant/dossiers/saekularisation-in-bruchsal/ See also References  Sources  *Translated and edited from :de:Philipp Franz Wilderich Nepomuk von Walderdorf, 10 Dec 2008 Counts of Germany Roman Catholic bishops of Speyer 1739 births 1810 deaths Walderdorff family ","title":"Wilderich of Walderdorf"},{"id":"20623473","text":"Brian Michael Fitzgerald (born December 26, 1974 in Woodbridge, Virginia) is a former Major League Baseball relief pitcher who played for the Seattle Mariners in .

The inventions are listed in chronological order based on the date of their introduction. Australian inventions include the very old, such as woomera, and the very new, such as the scramjet, first fired at the Woomera rocket range. The Australian government has suggested that Australian inventiveness springs from the nation's geography and isolation. Perhaps due to its status as an island continent connected to the rest of the world only via air and sea, Australians have been leaders in inventions relating to both maritime and aeronautical matters, including powered flight, the black box flight recorder, the inflatable escape slide, the surf ski and the wave-piercing catamaran winged keel. Since the earliest days of European settlement, Australia's main industries have been agriculture and mining. As a result of this, Australians have made many inventions in these areas, including the grain stripper, the stump jump plough, mechanical sheep shears, the Dethridge water wheel, the froth flotation ore separation process, the instream ore analysis process and the buffalo fly trap. Australian inventions also include a number of weapons or weapons systems, including the woomera, the tank, and the underwater torpedo. In recent years, Australians have been at the forefront of medical technology with inventions including ultrasound, the bionic ear, the first plastic spectacle lenses, the electronic pacemaker, the multi-focal contact lens, spray-on artificial skin and anti-flu medication. Australians also developed a number of useful household items, including Vegemite, and the process for producing permanently creased fabric. David Unaipon Many of Australia's inventions were realised by individuals who get little credit or who are often overlooked for more famous Americans or Europeans. Australian- Aboriginal man, David Unaipon is known as \\"Australia's Leonardo\\" for his contributions to science and the Aboriginal people. His inventions include a tool for sheep-shearing, a centrifugal motor, a multi-radial wheel and mechanical propulsion device. Unaipon appears on Australia's $50 note. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) is an Australian-government-funded institution. A number of CSIRO funded scientists and engineers are featured in this list. CSIRO scientists lead Australian research across a number of different fields, and work with industry and government to solve problems such as using insects to tackle weeds, growing more sustainable crops and improving transportation.

The Coolgardie safe was a box made of wire and hessian sitting in water, which was placed on a verandah so that any breeze would evaporate the water in the hessian and via the principle of evaporation, cool the air inside the box. The Coolgardie safe was used into the middle of the 20th century as a means of preserving food.

Retrieved on 25 March 2008 1906 ‚Äì Surf life-saving reel ‚Äì The first surf life- saving reel in the world was demonstrated at Bondi Beach on 23 December 1906 by its designer, Bondi surfer Lester Ormsby. A fluid film thrust bearing 1907 ‚Äì Michell thrust block bearing ‚Äì Fluid-film thrust bearings were invented by Australian engineer George Michell. Michell bearings contain a number of sector-shaped pads, arranged in a circle around the shaft, and that are free to tilt. These create wedge-shaped regions of oil inside the bearing between the pads and a rotating disk, which support the applied thrust and eliminate metal-on-metal contact. The small size (one-tenth the size of old bearing designs), low friction and long life of Michell's invention made possible the development of larger propellers and engines in ships. They were used extensively in ships built during World War I, and have become the standard bearing used on turbine shafts in ships and power plants worldwide. 1910 ‚Äì Humespun pipe-making process ‚Äì The Humespun process was developed by Walter Hume of Humes Ltd for making concrete pipes of high strength and low permeability. The process used centrifugal force to evenly distribute concrete onto wire reinforcing, revolutionising pipe manufacture. Dethridge wheel in 1936 1910 ‚Äì Dethridge wheel ‚Äì The wheel, used to measure the water flow in an irrigation channel, consisting of a drum on an axle, with eight v-shaped vanes fixed to its outside, was invented by John Dethridge, Commissioner of the Victorian State Rivers and Water Supply Commission. Harry McLaren, the first maker of surf skis, second from the left, with Ray Dick, Herb Reckless and Bert McLaren, left to right. 1919 on the Hastings River, Port Macquarie 1912 ‚Äì Surf ski ‚Äì Harry McLaren and his brother Jack used an early version of the surf ski for use around the family's oyster beds on Lake Innes, near Port Macquarie, New South Wales, and the brothers used them in the surf on Port Macquarie's beaches. The board was propelled in a sitting position with two small hand blades, which was probably not a highly efficient method to negotiate the surf. The deck is flat with a bung plug at the rear and a nose ring with a leash, possibly originally required for mooring. The rails are square and there is pronounced rocker. The boards' obvious buoyancy indicates hollow construction, with thin boards of cedar fixed longitudinally down the board. 1912 ‚Äì Tank ‚Äì South Australian Lance de Mole submitted a proposal to the British War Office, for a 'chain-rail vehicle which could be easily steered and carry heavy loads over rough ground and trenches,' complete with extensive drawings. The British war office rejected the idea at the time, but De Mole made several more proposals to the British War Office in 1914 and 1916, and formally requested he be recognised as the inventor of the Mark I tank. The British Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors eventually made a payment of ¬£987 to De Mole to cover his expenses and promoted him to an honorary corporal.Coulthard-Clark, Christopher D., Australian Dictionary of Biography, online edition, http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A080298b.htm, retrieved on 26 August 2008 1912 ‚Äì Self-Propelled Rotary Hoe ‚Äì At the age of 16 Cliff Howard of Gilgandra invented a machine with rotating hoe blades on an axle that simultaneously hoed the ground and pulled the machine forward. 1913 ‚Äì Automatic totalisator -The world's first automatic totalisator for calculating horse-racing bets was made by Sir George Julius.\\"Automatic Totalisators Limited ‚Äì later ATL\\".

One pole was applied to a skin pad soaked in strong salt solution' while the other pole 'consisted of a needle insulated except at its point, and was plunged into the appropriate cardiac chamber'. 'The pacemaker rate was not good from about 80 to 120 pulses per minute, and likewise the voltage variable from 1.5 to 120 volts.' The apparatus was used to revive a potentially stillborn infant at Crown Street Women's Hospital, Sydney whose heart continued 'to beat on its own accord', 'at the end of 10 minutes' of stimulation.Mond H, Sloman J, Edwards R (1982). \\"The first pacemaker\\".

Etymology The village got the name from the combination of two words - 'Kandal' and 'Oor'. 'Kandal' means mangrove forest which was once abundant in these region with its biodiversity of various flora and fauna. In Tamil language, 'oor' means place or village. Tamil was spoken throughout Kerala, once. History Not much is known about the ancient history of Kandalloor. Like any other mangrove forest region, the land was obviously marshy and was covered with thick mangrove plantations and plenty of inland water bodies with isolated landmasses. The fast disappearing 'kavu' (small bushy thick forest) and ponds and other water bodies are the remnants of this ancient geography of the region. Kandalloor village became part of 'Kayamkulam kingdom' which was later annexed to 'Travancore kingdom' during the reign of king 'Marthanda Varma' Geography The southern tip of Kandalloor is covered in three sides by Kayamkulam backwater. Being a mangrove forest, biodiversity thrived in the region- varieties of fishes, plants, animals, birds. Animals such as Otter, water snakes, varieties of frogs, and mongoose were plenty. It might have taken a long time to start the settlement in ancient Kandalloor because of scarcity of fresh water, land unsuitable for agriculture, non-navigable land covered with thick forest, plenty of insects and poisonous creatures, etc. Demographics India census, Kandalloor had a population of 20293 with 9429 males and 10864 females. Perhaps, the \\"Mukkuvan\\" (fishermen) community and some tribal communities like \\"Ulladan\\" were the early settlers. A big population of 'Mukkuvan' community still live in the western bank of Kayamkulam backwater ('Kayal' in local language). However, \\"Ulladan\\" are almost absent in the village, presently. Next major settlement might have started by people migrating from north towards south clearing the forest changing the land shapes to make it inhabitable. Ezhava community, who are present majority in the village have played a major role in changing the landscape and starting the agriculture in the region. During the medieval era, most of the land came under the control of temple (\\"Devswam\\") and slowly the land came under powerful 'Nayar' community, the land load community in the region. Nayar community might have occupied the region already, but their power got legalized during this era. Waterways A famous water way, which was famous during medieval era, connecting two major sea ports in Kerala - Kollam and Alappuzha - passes over the western boundary of Kandalloor village.

PWD Tourist Bungalow (Kattanam TB) situated at the prime area of Kattanam also has had a long and detailed history of politics, culture and literature to tell. Evening view of the town on a rainy day! History Kattanam was merged with Mankavu (Kavu with mango trees) and there was only a very few Hindu families were living in this place including Mankavil Gurunathanmaar those who were conducting mantravadham (Black Magic) and believed to had supernatural powers. The story of Kattanam is related to a Yakshi (Brahma Rakshas) lived in Mankavu was a folkloric vampire . She was a Brahmin lady who was living in the same place centuries before the mankavu was formed. She had found murdered in her tharavattu kulam (family pond) together with her unborn child. And it is also believed that the entire Brahmin family who were living there destroyed and centuries after Mankavu formed in the same place. The Brahmin lady was reborn into a Yakshi, waylaying men with her beauty and drinking their blood. It is also believed that after stopping the yakshi of Panayannarkavu, kadamattathu Kathanar (a priest with supernatural power) has visited Kattanam to stop the yakshi but he couldn‚Äôt succeed and returned. Even the karmas (actions) of Mankavil Gurunadhanmar‚Äôs were turned against them, their powers couldn‚Äôt withstand against yakshi and the unnatural death of their family members increased day by day. It has been found in devaprashnam (ascertaining the lord's will) that the land has to be sold (for prize) to someone to get rid of the yakshi as well as the curse on them. Kattanam was very fertile land but were not in use due to the fear of the yakshi in Mankavu. Finally a Scholar Velangattu Achen aka Mankavil Valiachen (Parish priest of Kattanam Orthodox Valiapally) has come forward and purchased the entire Mankavu for one Rasi (ancient Indian coin). This Mankavil achen arrested the yakshi with his Divine power and the yakshi requested him to install her to a paala tree (Alstonia Scholaris) which he refused and her soul sent permanently to rest in peace. From then the Velangattu achan known famous as Mankavilachan, destroyed the entire Mankavu and removed the fear from the public, made the place suitable for Katta (paddy with grains) production by Anam (blessing) from God. Because of the good fertility of the paddy land, the production of KATTA‚Äôs (paddy with grains) has increased, accumulated and traded from here, ‚ÄúKATTA-ANAM‚Äù means ‚ÄúBlessed with Paddy Grains‚Äù and since the place is known and called as KATTANAM. Kattanam Valiyapally is an epitome of Secularism. Valiyapally was established on 25 May 1835 by its founder Nilamel Anniyil Karyadil Mathunni Tharakan in the land delivered by a Hindu family Known as Piralasseri Puthan Vilayil family owned by Thuruthiyil Shri Sankaran. The church was blessed by Cheppad Philipose Mar Dionysius, (Malankara Metropolitan of The Malankara Syrian Orthodox Church during 1825‚Äì1855) in the name of the first Martyr St. Stephen. In the initial days of this church onwards St. Stephen‚Äôs Day is celebrated on January 20,21, 22 & 23 (Malayalam Month Makaram 6,7,8,9). Compared to the other churches in Malankara, different customs are practised here. One among them is the three- day-long possession(known as Raasa), which covers kilometers and kilometers to deliver the blessings . In this occasion all people, irrespective of caste or creed take part in the possession with prayers. This possession has become a must -see, colorful and elegant, filled with blessings. \\"Chempedappu\\" is also a custom related to Kattanam Valiyapally Perunnal. Later many of the Christian families migrated to Kattanam and together with the existing and migrated Hindu families they started cultivation in Kattanam and became best farmers.

One night he saw Devi in his dream in the form of a very proud old woman with a cane walking stick in her hand, she beat him with her walking stick and scolded him for sleeping there, the Karanavar woke up from his sleep found him immensely sweating ,after some days his smallpox got cured and he returned home.

Post independence it lost its importance in agro-map. Today this is one among the most consumer Panchayath in Kerala state. Researchers say these areas of Kerala (Pallipad, Karuvatta, Veeyapuram, Edathwa, Thakazhi, Kuttanad) are a dumping zone for rest of the area. The rivers and lakes collect waste from other parts of southern Kerala and dump it here. the recent bird flu incident has to be considered by keeping this in mind. The place is estimated to be a stinking junk yard of the future considering the latest growth of near by town Hariapad.

The document outlines the way Boutros-Ghali felt the UN should respond to conflict in the post-Cold War world. Recognizing the limitations of peacekeeping, especially as such efforts were becoming prevalent in the early 1990s, the UN Security Council convened in 1992 in a first-time meeting of heads of state. The 15 members finished the conference by issuing a statement calling on then-Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to write a report recommending future reforms. In their statement, the heads-of-state recognized that, > ‚ÄúThe absence of war and military conflicts amongst States does not in itself > ensure international peace and security. The non-military sources of > instability in the economic, social, humanitarian and ecological fields have > become threats to peace and security. The United Nations membership as a > whole, working through the appropriate bodies, needs to give the highest > priority to the solution of these matters.‚ÄùUN Department of Public > Information, Yearbook of the United Nations 1992, 34. The Security Council saw what many critics of peacekeeping have suggested, and some recent failures had made obvious: peacekeeping alone, as then practiced, was not enough to ensure lasting peace. Boutros-Ghali submitted his response some months later, in the form of An Agenda for Peace. In it, he outlined a number of additional processes of preventative diplomacy the international community could use before peacekeeping, or simultaneously. He also suggested distinct definitions for peacemaking and peacekeeping, and referenced Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter to justify military involvement without the consent of both parties.Michael W. Doyle, \\"Discovering the Limits and Potential of Peacekeeping,\\" 2-3. Previously, these concepts had not been formally addressed by the UN's leadership. However, An Agenda for Peace‚Äôs most significant contribution to the modern understanding of peace is its introduction of the concept of ‚Äúpost-conflict peacebuilding.‚Äù Boutros-Ghali defines ‚Äúpost-conflict peace-building‚Äù as ‚Äúaction to identify and support structures which will tend to strengthen and solidify peace in order to avoid a relapse into conflict.‚ÄùBoutros Boutros-Ghali, \\"An Agenda for Peace,‚Äù II.21. The concept of post-conflict peacebuilding has been especially important in the academic discipline of peace and conflict studies. It has been adopted by a number of scholars to suggest a framework for peace that addresses not only the latent forms of physical violence, but also aspects of a society that are structurally violent, and could lead to a re-emergence of fighting (see the discussion of positive peace in the article on peace and conflict studies).

Thrikkunnapuzha is the south-west part of Alappuzha district, Kerala, India. Renowned as Sreemoolavasam, this coastal area found in the Kerala history.

Thrikkunnapuzha beach is known for Karkidaka vavu or \\"Karkidaka Vavu Bali\\". The beach of Thrikkunnapuzha is rich in mineral sand called black sand. ‚ÄúThrkkunnappuzha Sri DharmaSastha Temple‚Äù is one of the temples in Alappuzha District History Thrikkunnapuzha is the south-west part of Alappuzha district. Renowned as Sreemoolavasam, this coastal area found in the Kerala history. An ancient port city and a busy port is believed to have been flourishing there in the ancient days. Some ancient manuscript reveals that this port city situated 5‚Äì6 km away from the present Sastha Temple which is now eroded by the sea. Well-known historian Sree Ilamkulam Kunjan Pillai in his book ‚Äòkeralolpathi‚Äô described this place. The Chinese explorer Huan Sang gives a note that, among the inhabitants here the ‚ÄòPali aryas‚Äô were dominant and they established a monastery with holy idols of SreeBudha. The ancient Sreemoola vasa nagaram was destroyed by the huge tidal waves from the Arabian Sea. Yet another story is in vogue about the existence of the old city. Parasurama the sixth incarnation of lord Mahavishnu, as he ventured to take vengeance against all the kshatriyas here was not fortunate enough to keep away from the anger of Parasurama. He killed them one by one and invaded their domains. Later he decided to divide the place in to 64 parts and give it to Brahmins. One among the 64 part was Sreemoolavasam or Sreemoolapadam. As his mind filled with sorrow that he had killed thousands of innocent people he decided to confess. He set up 64 temples and placed it with idols of Lord Siva, Lord Vishnu, and Lord Sasthav. After centuries the temple was eroded by the tidal waves. As the sea receded the idol of Sastha and debris of the temple were recovered and was believed to have been kept by the residents. Hundreds of years ago Keralam had been ruled by the emperor ‚ÄòCheraman Perumal‚Äô. He established places at Thrikkakkara, Kodungallur, and Kollam for administrative purpose, and deputed his representatives there. As he was an ardent follower of Lord Budha he decided to divide the dynasty among his sons and went for a holy journey. As he was traveling with his servants and Budha monks through Ashtamudi kayal and Kayamkulam kayal, he happened to see a river flowing to north. He continued to travel through the river. After traveling more, he stopped his boat and decided to take rest. People in large number crowded there to see Perumal and tell there grievance. They brought to notice the Sastha idol which they got from sea and the debris of the ancient temple. Acknowledging their request Perumal built a new temple and sanctified the idol of Sastha there. ‚ÄòThirukkonna puzha‚Äô called by Perumal was unified to ‚ÄòThrikkunnapuzha‚Äô as year passed, and the temple was known as ‚ÄòThrikkunnapuzha Sri Dharma Sastha Temple‚Äô. It was nearly 3 km to the west of the present temple.

This idea had surfaced in the late-1940s during dialogues between German and French historians in Speyer, which Schmittlein had set up in 1948/49. It became mixed with concepts of a Christian, ‚ÄúOccidental‚Äù history which were prevalent among a group of German historians, which included the medieval historian Fritz Kern (1884‚Äì1950) based in Bonn. He had headed the German delegation in 1948. The Catholic theologian and church historian Joseph Lortz (1887‚Äì1975) had also participated in these dialogues. The first plans for the foundation of an ‚ÄúInstitute for cultural and religious history‚Äù were drafted by Kern, who ‚Äì as the first director of the Institute ‚Äì in addition to the didactic goal also wanted to realize a multi-volume history of the world (‚ÄúHistoria Mundi‚Äù) that would be based on religion and would adopt a universal-historical perspective. Lortz served as an additional founding director. In 1950, he took up an extraordinary professorship for western religious history which was created especially for him in the philosophical faculty of Mainz University. These founding aims and history explain the structure of the research institute that was established in 1950 under the title ‚ÄúInstitut f√ºr Europ√§ische Geschichte‚Äù (IEG) (its charter came into effect on 19 April 1951), with its department of ‚ÄúWestern Religious History‚Äù (Abteilung fuer Abendlaendische Religionsgeschichte) and its department of ‚ÄúUniversal History‚Äù (Abteilung fuer Universalgeschichte). Both departments were headed up by a director, as they still are (currently Irene Dingel and Johannes Paulmann). Today, the directors also hold professorships at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz.  Function and Research Areas  The IEG's research on the historical foundations of Europe considers both integrating and antagonistic movements and forces shaping the geographic continent as well as the cultural context of Europe over centuries and setting up its distinct characteristics in contrast to the other continents. Research at the IEG thus targets pan-European and partly European communicative connections originating in bilateral and multilateral transfer processes. Their protagonists did not necessarily have to be aware of their taking part in \\"Europe-wide\\" interrelations. The religious and confessional developments of these transfer processes are one important focus of research at the IEG. Also, research on the foundations of Europe maps the history of conscious reflections on Europe and Europeans, and analyses attempts at political unification, existing political plans for Europe, ideal conceptions and utopian visions of Europe ‚Äì always including anti-European ideas in the picture. An integral element of this approach is the history of historiography on Europe. This conceptual formulation includes a reflexion of theory and methods of historical research on Europe. The Leibniz Institute of European History questions the focus of interest of 'European' approaches and reflects the underlying ideological propositions in historical research on the history of Europe. The Institute‚Äôs charter defines the primary goals of the IEG as follows: \\"Research on the religious and intellectual traditions of Europe, their development and crises, and particularly on religious differences, their effects and the possibilities of overcoming these differences\\", and \\"Europe- focused fundamental research which assists the historical understanding of the process of the coalescence of Europe and the individual historical paths of the European states and peoples\\". In accordance with its charter, IEG pursues these goals through: * its own research projects conducted by staff members individually or jointly with other academics from Germany and abroad * the funding it provides to young postgraduate researchers from Europe and the other continents, who work on research projects on European history and who live at the Institute as fellows and scholarship holders * collaboration with other institutions in Germany and abroad that pursue similar aims * its own publications and the support it provides to other publications, in which contentious aspects of research on European history are discussed * the transfer of knowledge to the wider society  Current Research Programme  The Leibniz Institute of European History (IEG) researches the historical foundations of Europe in the modern era. Its research projects are developed in an interdisciplinary way by the sections \\"Abendl√§ndische Religionsgeschichte\\" and \\"Universalgeschichte\\". They span the historical periods from the beginning of the early modern period to contemporary history. The central theme of the current research programme at the IEG is \\"negotiating difference\\" ‚Äì the ways in which difference is established, confronted and enabled in its religious, cultural, political and social dimensions. Together with the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, the IEG runs the graduate project \\"The Christian Churches and the Challenge of 'Europe'‚Äù, which is part- funded by the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft ‚Äì DFG).  Research Fellowship Programme  Since 1950, the IEG has awarded doctoral and postdoctoral fellowships for research stays in Mainz. It also welcomes international researchers as fellows in residence with external funding. The IEG states that its research fellowship programme combines research, training and international networking. Fellows can pursue their individual research projects. They discuss problems and methods of European historical research in an interdisciplinary and international surrounding. According to their special fields and interests, they are invited to participate in the academic activities of the Institute. In cooperation with its international partners, the Institute supports the exchange of fellows to embed them in a network of European historical research. The Leibniz Institute of European History (IEG) awards research scholarships and fellowships to young academics (doctoral and postdoctoral researchers) from Germany and abroad. Funding is provided for both doctoral and postdoctoral research dealing with the religious, political, social and cultural history of Europe from the early modern period to 1989/90. Comparative, transnational and transfer-historical research projects are particularly welcome, as are projects which deal with topics of intellectual, church or theological history. In 2013, the IEG established the Senior Research Fellowship Programme for established researchers. It enables the directors to invite respected academics from other European countries and outside Europe to Mainz to pursue their own research and to exchange ideas with the academics working at the IEG. For decades, the IEG has been receiving other scholarship holders and fellows funded by organizations abroad and in Germany (for example, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation and the DAAD) as visiting academics. Additionally, the Institute participates in the Leibniz-DAAD Research Fellowship Programme. These visiting researchers, who are usually young academics, usually stay at the Institute where they become part of the international community of IEG fellows and scholarship holders. Digital Humanities and Open Access The IEG works to promote innovative Open Access publications, the use of digital tools in historical research, and the expansion of digital research infrastructures. Far beyond the confines of academia, there exists a wide interest in research findings and resources published in Open Access ‚Äì for instance, the wide range of digitized historical maps or European History Online (EGO), published in German and English, which provides an overview of 500 years of modern European history across boundaries of geography, discipline, and methodology. Core questions of European history are also addressed in the Jahrbuch f√ºr Europ√§ische Geschichte/European History Yearbook, which has been published in an Open Access format since 2014 and contains articles in English and German. Another Open Access publication, \\"On site, in time - Negotiating differences in Europe\\", looks at events that took place in European locations and cast new light on the historical development of Europe since 1500. Approximately 60 articles illustrate the manifold conflict-laden approaches to difference and inequality have been. The Leibniz Institute of European History (IEG) is part of the new Mainz Centre for Digitality in the Humanities and Cultural Studies (mainzed). mainzed is a joint initiative of six scientific institutions to promote digital methodology in the humanities and cultural sciences in Mainz, Germany. Library The library offers approximately 90,000 printed titles and 900,000 licensed online resources on the history of Europe from the mid-15th century. There is an emphasis on general European history and international history, as well as on church history and the history of theology since the period of Humanism and the Reformation. The library holds numerous international learned journals and periodicals, with more than 500 running subscriptions (see the Overview of Journals ZDB). Additionally, a large number of both special and general bibliographical aids are available. The library‚Äôs entire collection is contained in the Institute‚Äôs Online Catalogue (OPAC). The catalogue also contains the new acquisitions of the current year and a large array of online resources and databases funded by the German Research Foundation. In the context of the HeBIS union of libraries, the Institute‚Äôs library is part of the local library system (Lokales Bibliothekssystem ‚Äì LBS) of Rhine-Hesse (organization and technical support is provided by Mainz University Library). Publications The IEG edits a monograph serial and a serial for conference reports, the latter being published online or in print. It runs a server for historical digital maps (IEG-MAPSServer for historical digital maps) and publishes European peace treaties of the early modern period.European peace treaties Further reading * Winfried Schulze, Corine Defrance: Die Gr√ºndung des Instituts f√ºr Europ√§ische Geschichte Mainz (= Ver√∂ffentlichungen des Instituts f√ºr Europ√§ische Geschichte Mainz.

A similar game with a slightly different board is also played by the Tohono O'odham tribe of Arizona. From the outset, these games look like hunt games similar to Catch the Hare, the Fox games of Europe, and the tiger and leopard games of Asia, because they use very similar boards, and the game mechanics (movement abilities and capturing rules) are the same, and the number of pieces each player controls is different. However, they are not the same games, because the goals are completely different. The goal of the one Indian is to capture just one of the twelve jackrabbits. The goal of the jackrabbits is to move themselves safely onto the other side of the board mirroring their initial positions. The game is unrelated to any other despite similarities in board design and mechanics. Indian and jackrabbits may actually be a game isolate. The game was described by Stewart Culin in his book \\"Games of the North American Indians Volume 2: Games of Skill\\" (1898) on page 798.  Goal  The Indian wins if it captures one jackrabbit. The Jackrabbits win if all of them move to the other side of the board mirroring their initial positions.  Equipment  A 5 x 5 square grid is used for the Tigua version. An Alquerque board is used for the Tohono O'odham version, which also consist of a 5 x 5 square grid but with additional diagonal lines. There is one Indian piece that is black, and twelve jackrabbit pieces that are white.  Game play and rules  # Players decide who will play the Indian, and who will play the Jackrabbits. It is uncertain which side traditionally starts first, however, players can agree among themselves who will start first. # The twelve jackrabbits are initially situated on one end of the board on the intersection points, specifically, the first two rows of the board, and on the right-most and left-most intersection points of the third row. The Indian is placed on the central point of the board which is the middle intersection point of the middle row (third row). # This is a turn-base game. Players alternate their turns. # On the Jackrabbits turn, one jackrabbit may be moved (in any direction) along a line onto a vacant adjacent point. In the Tigua version, there are only orthogonal lines, and therefore, rabbits can only move orthogonally. In the Tohono O'odham version, jackrabbits can move on the marked diagonal lines. # Similarly, on the Indian's turn, the Indian may be moved (in any direction) along a line onto a vacant adjacent point following the pattern on the Tigua or Tohono O'odham board. # Alternatively, the Indian can capture an adjacent jackrabbit by the short leap method as in draughts. The leap must be in a straight line, follow the pattern on the board, and land on a vacant intersection point immediately beyond the jackrabbit piece. #Only the Indian can capture. The Jackrabbits cannot capture. References *Culin, Stewart. Games of the North American Indians. Dover Publications, 1975. .

During mass protests against plans to change the constitution to allow President Blaise Compaor√© to run for another term, angry protesters attacked the National Assembly on 30 October 2014 and set it on fire, preventing a planned vote on the change. Later in the day, the military, apparently taking control of the country, announced that the National Assembly was dissolved; Compaor√© was forced to resign the next day. Legally, Compaor√©'s resignation meant that the President of the National Assembly should succeed him in an interim capacity, but the National Assembly had already been dissolved; in any case, the military, under Isaac Zida, had taken power, and it seemed impossible that the crowds so hostile to Compaor√© would accept Ouattara, a long-time Compaor√© loyalist, as a successor.

The project was built by Florida Power & Light Company (FPL). Lauren Engineers & Constructors (Abilene, TX) was the EPC contractor for the project. Its construction began in 2008 and was completed by the end of 2010. The ISCC plant is part of the Martin Plant site which consists of 5 units. Unit 1 & Unit 2 are 800 MW steam electric generating units that use natural gas and low-sulfur residual oil. Unit 3 & Unit 4 are 500 MW natural gas-fired combined cycle units. Unit 8 is a natural gas fired 4-on-1 combined cycle unit with a nominal capacity of 1150 MW. Light oil is used as backup. Unit 8, placed into commercial operation in 2005, is integrated with the solar plant. Unit 8 features four 170 MW gas turbines, one 470 MW steam turbine, and a single condenser and cooling tower The single solar field circuit heats 4 steam generators, after each gas turbine. The Martin solar thermal facility is designed to provide steam for FPL's existing Martin Unit 8 combined cycle unit, thus reducing FPL's use of natural gas. No additional capacity (MW) will result from the operation of the solar thermal facility. The Solar Energy Center has an array of approximately 190,000-mirror parabolic troughs on about of the Martin County plant. The solar collectors feed heat to the existing steam plant, displacing gas generated electricity at an estimated rate of 155,000 MWh per year. The 2012 solar-derived production was about 89,000 MWh of power, according to records filed with the state‚Äôs Public Service Commission, which was 42% less than projected when the plant got approval. It is to consider that the solar component can generate electrical energy only if the four gas turbines are in operation, otherwise the 470 MW steam turbine will not move. When gas turbines are stopped, the solar heat is used to keep the steam turbine in temperature, in order to facilitate a more rapid start- up. FPL expects the $476 million solar plant to reduce the combined-cycle power plant's natural gas consumption by 1.3 billion cubic feet (37 million m¬≥) per year. Over the 30-year life of the project, this is expected to save $178 million in fuel cost and reduce carbon emissions by 2.75 million tons. Excess pressure and a release of operating fluid led to the plant being shut down for four months in 2011 for cleanup and testing.Major spill at FPL solar plant gets glossed over As of , no additional concentrated solar plants are planned for Florida, although in 2007 FPL had planned on building a 300 MW Fresnel solar thermal plant.Big Solar Thermal Power Plants Planned for Florida, California Production {class=wikitable style=\\"text-align:right; font-size:0.9em; width:1050px;\\" +Generation (MW¬∑h) of Martin - !

The presiding deity of this temple is the goddess Kaali, who is worshipped in three forms, or Thrigunaathmika. The temple was built by the king of Kolathiri- Chirakkkal Raja after the swayambhoo of the goddess in Koduvally River, and so became renowned as Sree Chirakkakavu. According to established belief, the goddess Kaali appeared in the azhimugham of Vamal with her parivaras(retinue), in the palace where the river meets the sea. She assumed the form of a divine fish. The place is now known as Vamal, the Sree Moolasthana of Sree Chirakkakavu Bhagavathi. Chiirakkal Raja visited the palace and bowed to the goddess. The king then built the temple on top of Illikkunnu, believed to be the thapovan of an earlier era. The temple is surrounded by kavu or groves of trees.  Other deities (Upadevathas)  Guntur Kotta vaanavar, Ilankarumakan and Poothadi are in a single shrine near the temple. Outside the Nalambalamt there is a Sarppakkavu (Snake Shrine) in the south-west corner of the temple which contains Nagaraja, Nagakanyaka and Chithrkoodam.  Festival  The temple festival is celebrated every year on days 9-12 of the month of medaom which usually falls on 22 to 25 April. On Medom 9th the thantrik poojas and Uthsavabali is observed. In the evening the Uthsalva kolam (Thidambu) is taken out of the temple as Ezhunnallathu by the temple priest. This occasion is the only time where the goddess comes out of the temple in full alankaras in Ulthasava Thidambu.  Theyyam  This is the next three-day festival. The four manifestations of the goddess, Chorakalathil Bhagavathi, Puthiya Bhagavathi and Cheriya Thampuratty, are the daughters of the mother goddess and Valiya Thampuratty. Guntoor Kotta vanavan, Ilankarumakan, Poothadi are the other male Theyyams here. On Medom 10th the Nattathira is celebrated here. On 11 th Medom Ariyalavu is observed. This is a practice of giving rice, pulses and coconut oils to the all concerned communities to the kavu. This custom recalls the riches of bygone times. In the olden days, the Temple owned land from Vamla To Kali. In the morning of 11th medom Valaiya Thampuratty visits all devotees in the village (hosuses comes under Anchukandy Parambu) and blesses the devotees. Kalasams come from various parts of the villages to make offerings to the devi. Motha Kalasam and Vaikalasam have the right to enter to the temple first. By the early hours of 12th Medom the Theyyams start to come to the Thirumuttam in this order: Guntoor Kotta Vanavar, Chorakalathil Bhagavathi and Puthiya bhgagavathi. It is considered a blessing when a few drops of rain sweep through as Chaorakalthil bhagavthi theyyam appears on the courtyard of the temple. A Mulla Mala (Jasmine garland) is the traditional offering to Chorakkalathil Bhagavathi. Thirdly comes the Theyaam of Puthiya Bhagavathi (Theethira), The theyaam comes with the fire as ornaments and blesses the devotees. By the morning of 12th Medom the theyyam of Ilankarumankan and Poothadi appears on the courtyard of the temple. The theyyam is of divine war between the two. Then Thampuratty comes out into the courtyard. The Aattam of Thampuratty with her divine sword is a very rare sight which gives her devotees a life‚Äôs blessings. Then the Cheriya Thampuratty appears on the courtyard of the temple with beautiful white hair and other decorations. Then the Thampuratty with Thirumudy and her daughter, Cheriaya Champuratty travel around the temple, followed by the kalasalams and devotees in procession.

He inspired great confidence in the royal court (in the words of Adolphe Thiers \\"to the cause by his energy and his lights\\". His remarks leave no doubt as to his fidelity to the king: His ideas favouring a constitutional monarchy arose from those close to the king. Madame Campan, whose father was a friend of Mandat, answered Louis XVI's question \\"Who is this Mandat who at this moment commands the National Guard?\\" by saying \\"Sire, he is the most faithful of your subjects, but with much loyalty and very little intelligence. He is in the interests of the Constitution.\\".Ferrand, Jules (1817‚Äì1894), Histoire de la R√©volution, p. 222n The National Guard's attitude in 1792 was less loyal than Mandat's, though it varied from battalion to battalion: Guy de Rambaud also wrote that \\"the bataillon des Filles-Saint-Thomas, bataillon des Petits-P√®res, bataillon de Henri IV and bataillon des Grands Augustins, protected us from brigands and rebels\\".Guy de Rambaud, Pour l'amour du Dauphin, p. 103 et 104 Antoine Galiot Mandat \\"always offered his head as a guarantee of the king's good intentions\\", but after the flight to Varennes and due to revolutionary propaganda he could no longer succeed in convincing all the national guards. The battalions of the Saint-Antoine and Saint-Marceau faubourgs were openly hostile to him from 1789 onwards and in the other battalions the poorest guards were favourable to Jacobin ideas. = Mandat replaces La Fayette = La Fayette He replaced La Fayette shortly before 10 August 1792 as commander in chief of the National Guard. La Fayette had been a victim of false rumours as to his conduct and impeached. This proposition, backed by Brissot and heatedly fought by Vincent-Marie Vi√©not de Vaublanc and Quatrem√®re de Quincy, was repulsed by a majority of 406 votes against 224. Because of the vote, the deputies who had provoked him were assaulted, beaten and threatened with death after the session had ended, until the National Guard came to their rescue. According to Hippolyte Taine: \\"As to de Vaublanc, the main defender of La Fayette, having been attacked three times, he had taken the precaution not to go home but angry mobs showed up at his house, shouting that \\"eighty people will perish at their hands, and he would be first.\\" Twelve men who had climbed into his apartment and rummaged around also ransacked nearby houses, and, unable to catch him, looked for his family; they warned that if he returned to his home, he would be killed.\\"Taine, Les origines de la France contemporaine L'ancien r√©gime, La r√©volution, L'anarchie, la conqu√™te jacobine, p. 691, de l'√©dition de 1986, Bouquin chez Robert Laffont (tome 1) La Fayette tendered his resignation. The assault on the Tuileries was set for 10 August. The people of Marseille were given gunpowder and bullets by the municipality - a fact known to the court. Mandat, whose side was outnumbered, intended to defend the courts by posting some Swiss and grenadiers. He even amassed the National Guard in the garden and placed cannons on Pont Neuf and St. John's Arcade, behind the H√¥tel de Ville, to stop the rioters' descent from the suburbs. = Mandat's assassination = Galiot Mandat de Grancey was massacred by the crowd on the steps of the H√¥tel de Ville Louis XVI reviewing the troops defending the palais des Tuileries with Augustin-Joseph de Mailly, marshal of France, before the battles of 10 August.  The results of Mandat's death  During the final assault, Galiot Mandat de Grancey had already been assassinated and so the defence became disorganised  After his death  The sumptuous h√¥tel du Pr√©sident Duret, 67 rue de Lille, belonged to him in 1792 and remained in his son's ownership until 1797 despite Galiot Mandat's assassination.

She studied theology at the University of Cambridge, after which she has devoted her life to research in ancient Christianity. She has developed an approach to biblical studies known as Temple Theology. She was president of the Society for Old Testament Study in 1998, and in July 2008 she was awarded the Lambeth degree of Doctor of Divinity by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Temple Theology Temple Theology is an approach to biblical studies developed by Margaret Barker in her books starting from The Great High Priest (2003) and Temple Theology (2004). This approach identifies some elements of the theology and worship of the Jewish First Temple that endured beyond Josiah's reform and survived in both early Christian theology and liturgy and in gnosticism. According to this view Temple Theology has been influential in moulding the roots of Christianity as well as, or even more than, Hellenistic or synagogue culture.Collinwood, Dean W. & James W. McConkie. (2006). 'Temple Theology: An Introduction' by Margaret Barker. Provo, UT: BYU Studies 45:2 (May 2006). According to Barker, the main ideas of Temple Theology are the following: *understanding the First Temple as the figure of the whole universe: the inner court (the sea) to be the figure of the pagans, the Holy (the earth) to be the figure of the Jewish people and the Holy of Holies (the heaven) to be the figure of the Garden of Eden; * entering the Holy of the Holies is a mystical experience that transforms man into an angel (theosis),Barker, Margaret (2003). 'The Great High Priest'. Provo, UT: BYU Studies 42:3 (July 2003). thus entering the Garden of Eden and giving knowledge to understand creation. This idea is related to the Resurrection; * the main aim of the liturgy, and in particular of the Day of Atonement, was to maintain the Creation. * The Lord (Yahweh), the God of Israel, was the Son of God Most High. Jesus, from the very beginning, was recognised as the Lord in this sense. * The early Christian liturgy incorporated many elements of the First Temple Liturgy: the liturgy of the bread of the Eucharist traces its roots in the Saturday offering of the bread (Leviticus 24:5‚Äì9) and the liturgy of the wine in the Day of Atonement. Margaret Barker works from all the available sources (the Hebrew Bible, the Septuagint, the Dead Sea scrolls, the New Testament, the Jewish and Christian Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha, Gnostic texts, and other early writings and artwork). According to her, Sola Scriptura ‚Äì the doctrine that the Bible is the supreme authority in all matters of doctrine and practice ‚Äì has hindered rather than helped the understanding of Christianity.

Geography Soƒça is located on the upper Soƒça River in the Gori≈°ka region, the northern part of the Slovene Littoral, on the road from Bovec up to Trenta and the Vr≈°iƒç Pass. The territory of the village includes scattered farms on various foothills, promontories, and terraces in the narrow valley. Hamlets and farmsteads in the village include Brvca (a.k.a. Jezerca), ƒårƒç, Gorenja Soƒça, Lemovje, Log, Mi≈°ja Vas, Na Skali, Pod Bregom, Pod Skalo, Podklanec, Pri Kumerƒçih, V Klancu, Vr≈°iƒçem, and Vrsnik. To the northwest, the valley rises steeply to Mount Bav≈°ica Grintavec () and Little Mount Grintavec (). To the southeast, the valley rises more gradually to a plateau region. Name The settlement is named after the Soƒça River. The name Soƒça is derived from the form *S«´≈•a, which was borrowed from Latin (and Romance) Sontius. In turn, this is probably based on the substrate name *Aisontia, presumably derived from the PIE root * 'swift, rushing', referring to a quickly moving river. Another possible origin is the pre-Romance root * 'water, river'. History In antiquity the area was settled by Illyarians and Celts until the Romans conquered the area. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire it was ruled by Ostrogoths, Lombards, and Byzantines. In the 6th century South Slavs settled in the area. In the Middle Ages, the area south of the pass was ruled by the Patriarchs of Aquileia, later by the Republic of Venice and the March of Verona, until the estates were incorporated into the Inner Austrian lands under Habsburg Emperor Maximilian I in 1509. The area was part of Italy after the First World War. It was awarded to Yugoslavia after the Second World War. During the war, the area was controlled by Slovenian Partisans after the Italian surrender. Partisan hospitals operated in the village and it came under attack from German forces stationed in Bovec. Church St Joseph's Church A small church by the roadside in the village is dedicated to Saint Joseph and was built in 1718 and dedicated in 1823. In 1944 it was refurbished and painted by Tone Kralj. The refurbishment was a political statement and he included a scene of Archangel Michael fighting the Devil, in which Hitler and Mussolini are shown as enemies, fighting on the side of the Devil. He also used the Slovene national colours (red, white, and blue) in the interior and, apart from the Apostles and the Four Evangelists, used only Slavic saints in the iconography. Behind the church, the SŒøƒça Military Cemetery is a burial ground for Austrian soldiers that died on the Isonzo front.Bovec municipal site References External links *Soƒça at Geopedia * Populated places in the Municipality of Bovec ","title":"Soƒça, Bovec"},{"id":"20624850","text":"The following is a list of business schools in Australia organised by state.

The term only appeared in 1671, though such a gathering of units pre- dates this. Like the rest of the royal household, the military household was under the authority of the Secretary of State for the Maison du Roi, but it depended on the ordinaire des guerres (controlled by the Secretary of State for War) for its budget. Under Louis XIV, these two officers of state were given joint command of the military household. Composition The household was akin to the Household Division of the British Army in that it comprised a number of both cavalry and infantry units, serving as the sovereign's personal guard as well as elite troops during war. Recruitment to some of its units were limited to gentlemen, like the gardes du corps and musketeers. The rank and file of other regiments, such as the French Guards, were made up of commoners. However, it was impossible for commoners to rise to officer rank in units of the military household. On the field of battle, the \\"Maison du Roi\\" fought around the king and the \\"porte-cornette blanche\\" (the king's white standard), although the corps also fought in the absence of the king. Until the second half of the 17th century, The \\"Maison du Roi\\" had -- along with the \\"Cavalerie d'ordonnance\\", the six \\"Vieux\\" and the six \\"Petits-Vieux\\" -- made up the permanent army of the kingdom. =Corps= Over the years, the Maison du Roi included the following corps: * the Gardes du Corps (body guards) * the Cent-Suisses * the Gentilshommes √† bec de corbin * the Gardes Fran√ßaises (regiment created in 1563) * the Chevau-l√©gers (light cavalry) (1593) * the Gendarmes de la garde (1609‚Äì1611) * the Gardes suisses (1616) * the Mousquetaires de la Garde (two companies, 1622 and 1660) * the Gendarmerie d'ordonnance (1660, suppressed in 1788) * the Grenadiers √† cheval (1676) * the Gardes de la porte, sometimes known as Gardes de la porte du roi History Uniforms of the Musketeers of the Guard from 1660 to 1814 Far from being simply a ceremonial corps, the \\"Maison du Roi\\" participated in all the major military campaigns of the 16th and 17th centuries. =Under Francis I= The oldest of the regiments of the Maison du Roi was the Garde √âcossaise, formed in 1440, and traced its ultimate origins to the Scots forces brought to France in 1419 by John Stewart, Earl of Buchan, to fight against the English in the Hundred Years' War. Buchan's original company was divided in two, one part becoming the 1st (or Scottish) Company of the Life Guards (Gardes du Corps), the other becoming the senior company of Gendarmes. A second, French, company of Life Guards was formed by Louis XI in 1474 and the third by Louis in 1479. The fourth company, again French, was raised by Francis I in 1516. These companies existed until the French Revolution when they were disbanded. In 1567, during the \\"surprise of Meaux\\", the royal family escaped capture by Protestant troops of the prince de Cond√© through the intervention of the Cent- Suisses. =Francis I-Louis XIII= During the final period of the French Wars of Religion, Henry IV wished to provide guards for christening of the Dauphin (later Louis XIII). He created a new company of 200 men-at-arms which formed half of the Dauphin's guards. In 1611, this company became the Gendarmes de la Garde. This company was paired with another company of heavy cavalry. These chevau-l√©gers (light cavalry) wore armour and were only light when compared to the Gendarmes, who wore more armour. This company dated to 1570, and became part of the Dauphin's guard and then of the Maison du Roi. The next companies of the Maison du Roi, and by far the most famous, were the Musketeers, the guardsmen who appear in Dumas senior's The Three Musketeers. The first company, which was formed in 1622, represents the Musketeers in which D'Artagnan and his friends served. The second company, not taken into the Maison du Roi until 1663, has previously been the Cardinal Mazarin's guards. Perhaps, by this route, some of Cardinal Richelieu's guards eventually became King's Musketeers. =Louis XIV - apogee= Unlike the previous companies, officered by powerful nobles, and with many nobles in their ranks, the final company of the Maison du Roi was created as an elite force, formed by taking one grenadier from each infantry regiment and making him a mounted grenadier. The resulting picked men who would become the Grenadiers √† cheval were interviewed by Louis XIV. Those colonels who, in the Sun King's opinion had not sent the best of their men, were reprimanded and ordered to send a suitable replacement. The company was completed in 1676. The military household played a vital role in the Battle of Oudenarde of 1708, when it saved the French army from probable destruction. =18th century - decline= The regiments of the Maison du Roi did not see significant active service after the Seven Years' War of 1756-1763. For reasons of economy at a time of financial crisis, several of these expensive units were disbanded in 1787. These included the gardes de la prevote, the gardes de la porte, the gendarmes de la Garde, and the chevau-legers de la Garde. The mousquetaires de la Garde had already been dissolved on 1 January 1776. The Garde du Corps (Body Guard), the Gardes fran√ßaises (French Guards) and the Gardes suisses (Swiss Guards) were however retained in service, the first named because of its close ties to the Royal Court, the second two because they comprised the largest, and historically most effective, infantry components of the Maison du Roi. At the outbreak of the French Revolution in July 1789, the French Guards defected from the Monarchy and joined in the attack on the Bastille. The Body Guard was formally disbanded in 1791, although this aristocratic body had dispersed when the Royal Family had been forced to leave Versailles in October 1789. This left the Swiss Guard as the last remaining unit of the old Maison du Roi, although a short-lived Garde Constitutionelle du Roi was raised on 16 March 1792. On 10 August 1792, most of the 900 Swiss Guards defending the Tuileries were massacred when the palace was stormed by revolutionary forces. With the overthrow of the Monarchy the Maison militaire du Roi ceased to exist. =Restoration= Following the First Restoration of 1814 the Bourbon Monarchy attempted to recreate the Maison militaire du Roi, even re-establishing the mostly-ceremonial units that had been disbanded by Louis XVI in 1787. In part this was to provide military roles for emigre royalist officers who had returned to France, or their sons. There was not however sufficient time to raise a new Swiss Guard before Napoleon's return from Elba in March 1815, although the future Charles X acknowledged that the regiment's past services warranted this being done. The Maison militaire disintegrated during the flight of Louis XVIII to Belgium and only 450 men remained with him to cross the frontier. After the Second Restoration, no serious attempt was made to again restore the Maison militaire du Roi and it was (with the exception of a re-organised Body Guard) replaced with an entirely new Royal Guard of division size, which lasted till 1830. The 1816-30 Royal Guard was organized into 12 infantry regiments plus the one Cent-Suisses company from the Military Household, 8 cavalry regiments plus the Garde du Corps squadron and the Artillery Regiment of the Royal Guard, with 8 batteries united into 2 battalions.

It followed the adventures of Sir Prancelot, an eccentric inventor-knight who heads for the Crusades in the Holy Land. It was first transmitted on BBC 1 on Thursday, 13 January 1972. Plot To escape both his bank manager and his overbearing wife Lady Histeria, Prancelot decides to join the crusades. He is dismayed when he learns that Histeria intends to accompany him and eventually the entire household - including the children Sim and Sue, the miserly majordomo Girth, a cockney minstrel (who is also the show's narrator) and several serfs - set sail for adventure. They repeatedly fall foul of the dastardly Count Otto \\"The Blot\\" but always escape by some contrivance of Sir Prancelot himself. After many unlikely adventures they arrive in the Holy Land to discover they are 50 years too late. After a final showdown with Count Otto they return to England in a rocket ship also invented by Sir Prancelot. Background The Sir Prancelot animation came from the same stable as Captain Pugwash and was in a similar style. Narration All voices were performed by Peter Hawkins. The story featured the narration of The Minstrel character, whose Cockney accent was rather reminiscent of Michael Caine. The music was composed by Alan Parker.

She also served as magistrate on the Brighton bench, was a prison commissioner and a member of the National Council of Women. She served with the Scottish Women's Hospitals at Royaumont Abbey in France in World War I, and as a surgeon in London in World War II. Through her writings she promoted medicine as a career for women. Early life Louisa Martindale was born in Leytonstone, Essex, the first child of William Martindale (c. 1832‚Äì1874) and his second wife Louisa, n√©e Spicer (1839‚Äì1914). The family had a Congregational Church background. Her mother, \\"a champion of a larger life for women\\", was an active suffragist and a member of the Women's Liberal Federation, and of the executive committee of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. In the 1880s, Mrs. Martindale held open house for Brighton shop girls on a regular basis, and young Louisa would have grown up in an environment supportive of her future career. After the death of William Martindale the family moved to Cornwall, and thence to Germany and Switzerland, finally returning to England to live in Lewes, East Sussex. In 1885 the family moved again, this time to Brighton so that Louisa and her sister Hilda could attend Brighton High School for Girls. From an early age it had been decided that Louisa should become a doctor, and at 17 she was sent to Royal Holloway, University of London in Egham and obtained her London Matriculation in 1892. She then entered the London School of Medicine for Women in 1893, gaining her MB in 1899, and her BS. In 1900 she went north to Hull as an assistant to Dr. Mary Murdoch, the beginning of her professional life. Murdoch and Martindale worked closely as they were partners in their business. In 1902 they went on a cycling holiday together visiting Vienna, Berlin and Switzerland. They were in partnership until 1906.Katharine Cockin, ‚ÄòMurdoch, Mary Charlotte (1864‚Äì1916)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, May 2005 accessed 15 Nov 2017 Professional life After five years in Hull, in 1906 Martindale gained her Doctor of Medicine and returned to Brighton. She started her own general practice and very soon was asked to join the Lewes Road Dispensary for Women and Children (which in 1911 became the Lady Chichester Hospital, Brighton Branch) as a visiting medical officer. In 1920 she was instrumental in the setting up of the New Sussex Hospital for Women in Windlesham Road, Brighton, and held the post of senior Surgeon and Physician there until 1937. She left Brighton and Hove in 1922, moving to London to start a Surgical Consultant Practice but continued to operate part-time at the New Sussex Hospital. After moving to London as a Consultant Surgeon, Louisa soon became known as honorary surgeon at the Marie Curie Hospital. In 1931, Martindale was elected as President of the Medical Women's Federation. She was appointed C.B.E. that same year. Two years later, she was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. In 1937, Martindale was appointed to the Council of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists as the first woman member in history. Martindale's medical interests were sometimes controversial, especially her studies of venereal disease and prostitution. Her book Under the Surface (1909), in which she spoke quite openly about these very topics, apparently caused a stir in the House of Commons. She also laid the groundwork for research in the treatment of uterine cancer and fibroid growths in women by means of intensive X-ray therapy. She secured a long and distinguished life and career in medicine, carrying out over 7000 operations. Her work brought her respect and acknowledgment from both her colleagues and her patients: she was made a Fellow of the Royal College of Obstetricians in 1933, and was a member of the Royal Society of Medicine. Eventually she became a specialist in the early treatment of cervical cancer by X-ray and she later lectured extensively throughout the UK, the United States, and Germany. Personal life An active member of the Brighton Women's Franchise Society, she also served as Magistrate for many years on the Brighton bench, became President of the Medical Women‚Äôs Federation in 1931, was a Prison Commissioner and a member of the National Council of Women. She served with the Scottish Women‚Äôs Hospitals at Royaumont Abbey in France in World War I, and as a surgeon in London in World War II. Martindale never married and lived for more than three decades with another woman, Ismay FitzGerald (c. 1875-1946), daughter of Baron FitzGerald of Kilmarnock. Some scholars are wary of identifying Martindale as a lesbian. Geoffrey Walford, for instance, does not state whether Martindale's \\"woman-centered lifestyle\\" specifically entailed a lesbian relationship. Others are more explicit and unhesitatingly propose Martindale's lesbianism, referring for instance to her 1951 autobiography A Woman Surgeon, in which she writes quite openly and tenderly (though without giving explicit detail) about her love for FitzGerald. Quoted from A Woman Surgeon, pg. 228, in Hamer pg. 142 Death Martindale retired from practice in 1947. She died in her home in London on 5 February 1966, aged 93.

The name is probably derived from a Romance reflex of the Latin word stirps 'tree, bush, root', which is preserved in Italian sterpo 'bushes, roots that have died off' and in Ladin ≈°terp 'brambles, brush litter'. A less likely theory derives the name from the Ladin common noun stirpe 'sterile cow'.Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimolo≈°ki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Zalo≈æba ZRC, p. 392. History From the mid-18th century onward, many residents of the village made a living by peddling. Others traditionally worked outside the village as seasonal labor. Nearly the entire village was destroyed by a fire in 1905, after which 10 houses were not rebuilt. Before the First World War, there were nine inns in the village. The village was not destroyed like others in the area during the First World War, although houses in poor condition were razed by the military and the narrowest streets were widened. During the war, the entire population was evacuated to Piedmont, from which they returned in 1919. After the Second World War, many of the residents emigrated, resulting in several abandoned and decaying houses in the village. Church The parish church in the settlement is dedicated to Saint Florian. The church stands in the center of the village and was built in 1755 following plans by the architect Janez Valentinƒçiƒç. An earlier structure at the site was built after 1474. The church has a poloygonal chancel walled on three sides, a rectangular nave, and a bell tower on the north wall of the nave.Slovenian Ministry of Culture register of national heritage reference number e≈°d 4020 Cultural heritage In addition to Saint Florian's Church, other sites in Srpenica are registered as cultural heritage: *The Ograjenica archaeological site is a flat urnfield burial site from the Hallstatt culture.Slovenian Ministry of Culture register of national heritage reference number e≈°d 17646 *A monument to Countess Lucy Christalnigg was installed in 1914.

The RADIUS protocol is a widely deployed authentication and authorization protocol. The supplementary RADIUS Accounting specification also provides accounting mechanisms, thus delivering a full AAA protocol solution. However, RADIUS is experiencing two major shortcomings as time passes since its initial design: its dependency on the unreliable transport protocol UDP and the lack of security for large parts of its packet payload. Specifically, for the latter, RADIUS security is based on the MD5 algorithm, which has been proven to be insecure. The main focus of RadSec is to provide a means to secure the communication between RADIUS/TCP peers on the transport layer. The most important use of RadSec lies in roaming environments where RADIUS packets need to be transferred through different administrative domains and untrusted, potentially hostile networks. An example for a world-wide roaming environment that uses RadSec to secure communication is eduroam.

There are smaller groups of Hozo speakers in Mana Sibu woreda. The term Hozo is usually understood by the Mao to refer to a clan. Hozo speakers prefer to call themselves Amo. Hozo and Seze are sometimes called Begi Mao. Hozo is spoken by roughly 3,000 people in Ethiopia. Hozo is also a clan in the Begi area. The Hozo language is also known as Begi-Mao and Mao of Begi. Its classification is Afro-Asiatic, Omotic, and Mao. The word Mao is Omotic and means ‚Äòman; people‚Äô, occurring as [ma:…™] in Seze and as [m…î:] in Hozo. Mao is frequently used as an ethnic term. There is a kind of Mao identity across language differences in Ethiopia. While it is generally accepted today that Omotic is one of the primary branches of the Afro-Asiatic family, the position of the four languages Hozo, Seze, Ganza and Northern Mao is still being discussed. The Mao languages are the least documented within Omotic, and Omotic itself is the least documented of the Afroasiatic groups. Geographic Distribution The Omotic Mao languages Seze and Hozo form a compact area in Oromia Regional State surrounded by Oromo speakers on three sides. There seems to be some disagreement amongst the scientists as well as amongst the speakers in how far Seze and Hozo can be classified as two different languages or as dialects of the same language. It has been argued that Seze and Hozo are not two different languages; just two different dialects from village to village. The area where Hozo is predominately spoken appears to be scattered, and there are only a few villages where Hozo is reported as the only Omotic Mao language. Hozo people prefer less permanent forms of settlements for their families and herds. Omotic languages include Anfillo, Ari, Bambassi, Kara, Kefa, Gana, Dime, Nayi, Sheko, Hozo, Yemsa, and Welaytta.K√ºspert, K. C. (2015). The Mao and Komo languages in the Begi‚ÄìTongo area in Western Ethiopia: Classification, designations, distribution. Linguistic Discovery, 13(1), 1-63.Siebert, R., Wedekind, C., & Wedekind, K. (1994). Third SLLE survey on languages of the Begi/Asosa area. Survey of Little-Known Languages of Ethiopia (SLLE) Reports, 15, 1-19. Classification Hozo is an Omotic language. Omotic languages are an Ethiopian linguistic group consisting of more than twenty-five distinct languages. Omotic languages developed in the southwestern region near the river Omo, which gave the group its name. Distinct ethnic groups in Ethiopia speak individual languages classified as Omotic.Rydgren, E. (2016). Omotic Languages. Salem Press Encyclopedia. Largely verbal, the Omotic languages are rarely written down. When they are written, either the Ge‚Äôez (Ethiopic) or Latin alphabet is used, but no standard transliteration from the Ethiopic to the Latin exists. Ge‚Äôez is the ancient language of Ethiopia, which was first introduced as an official written language during the first Aksumite Kingdom between the first and seventh centuries BCE. The earliest known inscriptions of Ge‚Äôez date to the fifth century BCE. Written in horizontal lines from left to right, it was created based on the Sabean/Minean alphabet and is still used by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church in the twenty-first century. Ethiopian languages are classified into four major groups: Semitic, Cushitic, Omotic, and Nilo-Saharan. The Omotic languages are largely verbal and have several defining characteristics: the majority of vocabulary is monosyllabic, and the languages have ten vowel-sounds: five short and five long. Scholars estimate that there are between twenty-five and forty Omotic languages, but the group has not been extensively studied. An ongoing debate among linguists exists regarding the inclusion of Omotic languages in the Afro-Asiatic phylum. Experts cannot agree as to whether the system should be labeled as Afro- Asiatic, Nilo-Saharan, or something unique. Until the 1960s, Omotic languages were considered as a west-Cushitic subgrouping. History of Scholarship After World War II, efforts began to document Ethiopia‚Äôs history; however, much more attention was paid to the northern region, which had many Christian communities, a connection to the Ark of the Covenant, and the rock-hewn churches. Little attention was paid to the southern and southwestern Omo valley. Then a socialist coup in 1974 halted most research and expeditions, leaving vast gaps of knowledge about Omotic speakers and their history. Omotic languages are not well studied.

The entire house, devoid of any extraneous ornamentation, reflects the austerity of the life of the Carmelite nuns who are believed to have used this house as their residence. The monastery was founded on October 15, 1790, by four Belgian Carmelite nuns, three of them former natives of Charles County. In 1831 the nuns then in residence were ordered to transfer the convent to Baltimore, Maryland, and this property was abandoned. In 1933 an organization called the Restorers of Mt. Carmel in Maryland, formed to aid in the restoration of the site. The Mt. Carmel Monastery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.

The word refers to having a direction or purpose in life, that which makes one's life worthwhile, and towards which an individual takes spontaneous and willing actions giving them satisfaction and a sense of meaning to life. This concept can be traced back to a central principle of health and wellness that is the basis of all Traditional Japanese Medicine.  Etymology  The word consists of 'Iki' (to live) and 'gai' (reason). The term ikigai compounds two Japanese words: meaning \\"life; alive\\" and kai (Áî≤Êñê) meaning \\"(an) effect; (a) result; (a) fruit; (a) worth; (a) use; (a) benefit; (no, little) avail\\" (sequentially voiced as gai) to arrive at \\"a reason for living [being alive]; a meaning for [to] life; what [something that] makes life worth living; a raison d'√™tre\\".Watanabe Toshir≈ç (Ê∏°ÈÇäÊïèÈÉé), Edmund R. Skrzypczak, and Paul Snowden, eds. (2003), Kenky≈´sha's New Japanese-English Dictionary (Êñ∞ÂíåËã±Â§ßËæûÂÖ∏), 5th edition, Kenkyusha, pp. 127, 459, 130. In the game go, iki especially means \\"alive\\" (able to remain on the board indefinitely): \\"in go normally a situation in which a connected group of stones of any size contains at least two independent liberties [me] and so cannot be captured by an opponent\\". Overview Ikigai can describe having a sense of purpose in life, as well as being motivated. Psychologist Michiko Kumano describes Ikigai as eudaimonic well-being, as it \\"entails actions of devoting oneself to pursuits one enjoys and is associated with feelings of accomplishment and fulfillment\\". The word ikigai is also used to describe the inner self of an individual, and a mental state in which the individual feels at ease. Activities that allow one to feel ikigai are not forced on an individual; they are perceived as being spontaneous and undertaken willingly.  Importance  In the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, ikigai was thought to be experienced towards either the betterment of society (\\"subordinating one's own desires to others\\") or improvement of oneself (\\"following one's own path\\"). In the 21st century however, ikigai's focus has shifted towards the self; instead of \\"self-sacrifice\\", the focus is on developing oneself. According to anthropologist Chikako Ozawa-de Silva, for an older generation in Japan, their ikigai was to \\"fit this standard mold of company and family‚Äô\\", whereas the younger generation reported their ikigai to be about \\"dreams of what they might become in the future\\". A 2012 study in the Global Journal of Health Science suggested that having the feeling of ikigai influenced the functioning of the frontal lobe. Some studies showed that women who did not feel ikigai were more likely to experience cardiovascular diseases. However, there was no evidence of any co-relation with development of malignant tumors.

The island is one of the Cyclades islands, which neighbour Delos in the Aegean Sea. The windmills can be seen from every point of the village of Mykonos, the island's principal village, which is frequently called the Chora (which translates to \\"Country\\" in Greek, but refers to an island's \\"Town\\") on Greek islands. The windmills are the first thing seen when coming into the harbour of Alefkandra, as they stand on a hill overlooking the area. Most windmills face towards the North where the island's climate sources its strongest winds over the largest part of the year. There are currently 16 windmills on Mykonos of which seven are positioned on the landmark hill in Chora. Most of them were built by the Venetians in the 16th century, but their construction continued into the early 20th century. They were primarily used to mill wheat. They were an important source of income for the inhabitants. Their use gradually declined until they ceased production in the middle of the 20th century. The architecture of each of them is similar, all have a round shape, white colour and a pointed roof and very small windows. Such windmills are found in almost all Cyclades islands. One of these windmills has been transformed into a museum. The whole village of Chora and part of the harbour are visible from this point.

Opened in 2004, it is housed in a red-colored stone building completed in 1949 as a Lutheran church. Hillsboro, a city on the west side of Portland, owns the three-level facility and operates it through their Parks and Recreation Department. Walters Cultural Arts Center includes gallery space, classroom space, and a 200-seat performance hall. With two above ground floors and one below ground level, the center has a total of of space. Located on East Main Street, the Washington County Courthouse and the Hillsboro Civic Center are just to the west and the Edward Schulmerich House one block to the east on Main. The center is named in honor of a local couple who donated $1 million towards the project which included purchasing the property and US$2.4 million worth of renovations. History The Trinity Lutheran Church congregation was founded in 1917 and acquired their first church in 1923. By the 1940s the congregation needed a larger place to worship and bought a lot on the corner of Fifth Avenue and East Main Street in downtown Hillsboro in 1941. A Camas, Washington, rock quarry offered the church an unlimited amount of red colored rock for $1,000 as a long as the church transported the rock back to Hillsboro. Construction began in 1947 and the new church was completed in 1949. By the late 1990s Trinity Lutheran had again outgrown their church and began building a new campus in the southeast part of the city. The church did not want to sell its former home to just anyone, or for it to be torn down. At this time the city was looking for a space to use as an arts center. Plans for an arts and culture center in Hillsboro were made in the city's Hillsboro 2020 Vision. This community plan was finalized in 2000 and designed to improve the livability of the city located in the Portland metropolitan area. Hillsboro purchased the property from the church for $1.325 million in November 2000. Most of the purchase price came from a $1 million donation by Glenn and Viola Walters to the city to help pay for an arts center in 1999. The Walterses had earned their money from operating a nursery in the surrounding community. The city had hoped to open a remodeled arts center during the winter of 2001, but this was delayed with later estimates having the center opening in late 2002. In December 2002, construction began on the work to transform the church into a culture and arts center. WaterLeaf Architecture & Interiors designed the changes to the building that sits on a lot. Renovations included adding a new roof, creating a new entrance, adding an elevator, among other changes. Creating a new entrance involved removing hand quarried stone from the walls to enlarge a window opening. The remodeling also brought the building up to modern seismic codes and to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). City officials hoped to maintain the character of the original structure despite changes and upgrades. The total cost for renovations as of opening were $2.4 million, with the city paying for 60% of those costs. Some financing for the center came from selling bricks to the public that were then used on exterior spaces. On March 16, 2004, the Glenn & Viola Walters Cultural Arts Center opened. Total cost for the project including buying the property was around $3.5 million. The center's operating budget comes from city funds and user generated fees. A new classical music concert series was started at the center in 2009, as was a book club focusing on arts and culture titles. In April 2010, the Oregon Mandolin Orchestra held their first ever concert at the center. Building South side facing Main Street Located on Main Street at Fifth Avenue in downtown Hillsboro, the center is two blocks from the Hillsboro Central/3rd Avenue Transit Center MAX light rail station. The building covers of space and contains five classrooms, a lobby, meeting rooms, a box office, exhibition gallery, and an auditorium. The main part of the building has rock walls, and the auditorium contains high, arched ceilings and stained-glass windows. Once featuring a stone chimney, contractors removed the chimney during conversion to the center and inserted an elevator to comply with ADA requirements. The T-shaped center has three levels, which includes a basement that houses classrooms used for art instruction. Instruction includes courses on creating pottery, sculptures, and ceramics. The second story contains exhibition gallery space and multipurpose rooms, with the focus on visual arts. On the main level is the auditorium where the church's sanctuary was located. The auditorium seats up to 200 people and is used for concerts, lectures, plays, and other events. On the outside is a garden, and a lawn area to the east with a small stage that is used for fair weather events such as summer concerts. Also outside the building is a new wheelchair ramp that was added to the east side where a new entrance was added. There are two terraces on the exterior of the building and the inside also has a kitchen area. Operations East face of the building Walters Cultural Arts Center was designed to be a bookend, along with the Hillsboro Civic Center, to increased downtown development. The center is the city's first dedicated arts facility. City officials hoped to create a magnet for artists and aficionados in the downtown area with the center and other developments that include a renovated Venetian Theatre. The goal was to have the center encourage art studios to open and for art related festivals to develop to attract people to downtown after most businesses closed. Traditionally, shops and businesses closed by 6:00 p.m. as workers in the county seat left for the day. The center also is rented out to groups for private functions. Performances at the Walters Cultural Arts Center include opera, folk music, country music, and spoken word acts. These include poetry readings and lectures. Art exhibits have included \\"Organic,\\" \\"Questioning Functionality,\\" and \\"Questioning Functionality 2 (QF2)\\" among others. These shows have included art forms such as interior design, crafts, sculpture, and fine art.

If the borrower's speculative play with the funds provided by the bank does not pay off, the bank can face significant losses on its loan portfolio, and if the bank fails its depositors can lose some of their money if the deposits are not insured by a third party. The skill of identifying potential successful new entrepreneurs who can take market share off competitors or develop whole new markets is one of the most vital (and intangible) skills any banking system can possess. An unexpected form of entrepreneurship, and unintended consequence of microfinance initiatives, can be informal intermediation. That is, some entrepreneurial borrowers become informal intermediaries between microfinance initiatives and poorer micro- entrepreneurs. Those who more easily qualify for microfinance split loans into smaller credit to poorer borrowers. Informal intermediation ranges from casual intermediaries at the good or benign end of the spectrum to 'loan sharks' at the professional and sometimes criminal end of the spectrum. Disintermediation occurs when potential lenders and borrowers interact more directly in the capital markets, avoiding the intermediation of banks.

Team 2006 In 2000, when Germany was selected to host the World Cup, the national team was in decline - the squad was ageing, with little in the way of emerging talent. After the team was knocked out in the first round of Euro 2000, the German Football Association decided to form 'Team 2006' - a development team for young players, with the hope of producing a squad that could perform at the 2006 World Cup. The team played ten fixtures between 2002 and 2005, with four wins, four draws and two defeats. Ultimately, only four players from Team 2006 were part of the World Cup squad - Tim Borowski, Arne Friedrich, Mike Hanke and Timo Hildebrand.

Acknowledging that the state of their homeland, Haiti, was troubled and unstable, they each decided to leave and set their sights on the United States. Always driven by their passion for music, this small group reunited in New York to touch upon making their current past-time a potential career. They soon found themselves surrounded by sound proof foam mats, extended boom of mics and a mixing board. To their surprise, each had the same desire to pursue their music and created the name for their band by the taking the first two letters of their first names Carlo Vieux, Richard Cav√© and Mikael Guirand; atlas, Carimi was born. Hours and hours at the studio in the hopes of creating a new sound, one that was uncommon in the music industry at the time, the band found themselves putting on paper some profound, socially shared lyrics that encompassed the disorders of their native land. Haiti Bang, Bang, was released in the summer of 2001. Instantly, Carimi became a household name. They are known as one of the first younger generation digital bands to put out music that reflected upon the political pressures and the deteriorating security of Haiti. They had mass appeal to the Haitian diaspora who fled the country and through their allure lyrically, musically and of course sex appeal for the ladies, Carimi has thrived throughout the years. In 2016 the singer Mickael Guirand decided to quit the band due to personal issues. The rest of the founding members decided to end their long journey and have gone on separate musical expeditions.

They are also referred to as Zilmamo, which is the name of their country, situated west and south of Jeba town, towards the border with Sudan. The Gimira call the Baale people and their language Baaye, whereas the Anywak refer to them as Dok. The Baale people call the neighboring Dizi people Saara, and the Amhara are referred to as Goola. Baale is also spoken across the border in Sudan, in an area known as Kachepo, which is the name used by the neighboring Toposa, Juje, and Murle for the Baale people and their country.\\" There are no known dialects of Baleesi, but it is closely related to the Didinga-Murle cluster, which consists of Didinga, Tennet, and Larim in Sudan, and Murle in both Sudan and Ethiopia. It shares 40%-54% lexical similarity with Murle and 35% lexical similarity with Mursi. It is spoken in Rumeat, Upper Boma, and Mewun villages, Pibor County, Boma State, located near the Ethiopian border. It is also spoken in the northwestern corner of East Equatoria State. The Baleesi counting system is based on twenty and uses the same quinary system as does the Didinga-Murle cluster. The word for \\"1,000\\" literally means \\"plenty,\\" and everything greater than 100 is referred to as \\"a lot.\\"Chan, Eugene S. L. 2013. \\"Baalesi\\" at Numeral Systems of the World's Languages . Leipzig, Germany: The Department of Linguistics, Max Planck Institute. While the Tirma, Chai, and Baale people form an ethnic unit called Suri, sharing similar age-set systems, common ceremonies, and material cultures, their languages are only distantly related. There is no known writing system for Baleesi and it is regarded as an unwritten language. The language status is classified as vigorous, meaning that it is unstandardized and in use by all ages. However, it may still be considered an endangered language due to the relatively small population of native speakers in existence. Speakers The Baale have a positive attitude towards their language, and use it in most areas of life besides the market. Some Baale people can speak Tirma or Chai along with Baleesi, and a few also speak Dizi or Amharic. Speakers of Baleesi include non-native individuals as well. In Jeba town, there are Dizi people who speak Baleesi as a second language, and often serve as intermediaries between local or regional traders and the Baale people when they come to the market. The literacy rate of both first-language and second-language speakers is below 1%. =Culture= The Baale share many aspects of culture with their fellow Suri people. For example, a practice common among the tribes of the Surma (including the Baale), is the insertion of a clay plate into the bottom lip of young girls and women.Video depicting Surma women wearing lip plates Another ritual the Suri take part in is called the Donga, which involves champions of teams from different clans and villages fighting in pairs using long wooden sticks. The ritual is used as a way to resolve conflicts on either an individual or higher level.Video depicting the Donga stick fighting festival  References   Further reading  * Arensen, Jonathan E. 1989. \\"On comparing language relationships: a case study of Murle, Kacipo, and Tirma.\\" Occasional Papers in the Study of Sudanese Languages 6: 67-76. * M√∂ller, Mirjam. 2009.

After attending the technical school in Maastricht he joined the marines as war volunteer trained in Camp Lejeune, N.C., United States, to end the occupation by Japan in World War II. During his training the war was ended by the atom bomb and he was sent to the late colony of the Netherlands Indonesia. In 1947 he came back to the Netherlands, only to leave soon afterwards to the far East in an attempt to escape the poverty of his native surroundings.

It consists of an open- topped cylindrical steel shell equipped with a roof that floats on the surface of the stored liquid. The roof rises and falls with the liquid level in the tank. As opposed to a fixed roof tank there is no vapor space (ullage) in the floating roof tank (except for very low liquid level situations). In principle, this eliminates tank breathing loss and greatly reduces the evaporative loss of the stored liquid. There is a rim seal system between the tank shell and roof to reduce rim evaporation. The roof has support legs hanging down into the liquid. At low liquid levels the roof eventually lands and a vapor space forms between the liquid surface and the roof, similar to a fixed roof tank. The support legs are usually retractable to increase the working volume of the tank. Advantages External roof tanks are usually installed for environmental or economical reasons to limit product loss and reduce the likelihood of emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other potential air pollutants. Normally, the roof of the tank rests directly on the surface of the stored liquid, leaving little vapor space and consequently leading to a much lower risk of rim space fire. Disadvantages Snow and rain water can accumulate on the roof; the roofs are designed to hold up to a 24 hour 10\\" / 255mm rain event. Roofs are exposed to sunlight and weather which can accelerate corrosion. System function Water on the roof is usually drained by a special flexible hose or other special drain line system that runs from drain-sumps on the roof, through the stored liquid to a drain valve on the shell at the base of the tank. A hose is the shortest quickest route, Other drain systems are available both rigid and semi-rigid. These are named 'Articulated' as they use straight lengths of steel pipes with mechanical swivel joints or consist of steel pipes with flexible sections.

The action occurred during the War of the First Coalition phase of the French Revolutionary Wars.

A French traitor led the picked force of 1,200 into the outer fortifications. The alert defenders spotted Oberst (Colonel) von Wartensleben's attackers and drove them out of the fort with the loss of 120 killed and 251 captured. The French lost a handful of men killed and wounded and 63 captured. The traitor was captured and shot.Smith, pp 61-62 That same day, Prussian General Friedrich Adolf, Count von Kalckreuth with 13,000 troops defeated Hoche's 20,000 men at Biesingen. The French lost 760 killed and wounded, plus 42 captured. Prussian losses were only 16 killed and 92 wounded.Smith, p 62 The Battle of Kaiserslautern followed on 28 to 30 November 1793 when Hoche with 29,115 infantry, 5,046 cavalry, and 52 guns engaged Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel with 26,000 Prussians and Saxons. The Allies defeated the French with a loss of 2,400 killed and wounded, plus 700 men and two guns captured. Prussian casualties numbered 616 while the Saxons lost 190 men. Following the policy of King Frederick William II, Brunswick failed to follow up his victory with a vigorous pursuit.Smith, pp 62-63 Battle The allies were in their turn dispossessed by Hoche on 26 December and forced to retreat behind the Rhine.Friedrich Christoph Schlosser, David Davison (Translated by David Davison).

The main function of the site was to provide water to the municipal system, but it was also intended to use the grounds to be used as a public park.

When Chauncey Hurlbut died in 1885, he willed the bulk of his fortune, some $250,000, to beautify Water Works Park. The architectural philosophies of the era called for construction of monumental gates at the entrances to public places, to symbolically separate the park from the hustle and filth of the city. Part of Hurlbut's fortune was used to construct just such a gate. Description Hurlbut Gate, c. 1895 Herman A. Brede and Gustave Mueller were chosen to design this gate at a cost of $30,000. The structure is a three tiered triumphal arch, in length, in depth, and over high, built from limestone. It is decorated with carved garlands, water fonts and roundels, and an American eagle with outstretched wings tops the entire structure. Two stairways lead to a terrace twelve feet above the ground. The gate originally featured a statue of Chauncey Hurlbut inside the center dome, and an ornamental iron gate for vehicle entry, but both are now gone. The gate was substantially restored in 2007, with damaged limestone repaired or replaced, a stairway reconfiguration, repair of the eagle sculpture, and repair and replacement of light fixtures.Kelli B.

He wanted \\"great masters\\" to consider the instrument and raise it above the level of \\"dilettantes and street players\\" where it had been stuck for centuries. He expected that the mandolin and guitar would be taught in serious orchestral music schools and incorporated into the orchestra. A composer of more than 350 works for the mandolin, he led the mandolin orchestra Reale circolo mandolinisti Regina Margherita named for its patron Margherita of Savoy and gave the queen instruction on the mandolin. As a teacher, he wrote Scuola del mandolino: metodo completo per mandolino (School for the mandolin, a complete method), published in 1895. Silvio Ranieri described Munier in 1925 as one of the principal pioneers in the revival of the mandolin repertoire - a repertoire that with Munier began to move away from the limitations of the popular style (waltzes, serenades and fashionable marches) in order to approach the \\"art music\\" forms. Biography Carlo Gennaro Pasquale Munier was born in Naples on July 15, 1859, son of Vincenzo Munier, a printer, and Rosa Vinaccia. Orphaned at a very young age, he was adopted by the relatives of his maternal grandfather, the noted luthier Pasquale Vinaccia. The Vinaccia family of Naples had been active as instrument makers since the first half of the 18th century, and Pasquale is considered today one of the fathers of the modern mandolin for his technical innovations for the instrument. Munier acknowledged the closeness of his relationship with the Vinaccia family in his several references to Pasquale Vinaccia in his Method for mandolin, and in his dedication of the Three Mazurkas Op. 116-118 for mandolin and guitar to his uncle Gennaro, son of Pasquale. Growing up in the Vinaccia atelier, where he learned his first musical rudiments, Munier began to study the mandolin and the guitar with Carmine de Laurentiis, Neapolitan maestro of both instruments and author of the 1869 \\"Metodo per mandolino\\" published by Ricordi editions. Munier then enrolled in the S. Pietro Maiella Conservatory when he was 15, studying piano with the maestros Galiero and Cesi and harmony and composition with maestro Nicola D'Arienzo. He completed his studies at 19, winning awards in composition and harmony. In this period he performed at several concerts in Naples and published his first compositions, arrangements of La Traviata and I Puritani for two mandolins, mandola and piano, dedicating the last one to the Queen of Italy. When he was 22 Munier moved to Florence, where he spent the rest of his life. He quickly gained a reputation as a virtuoso, becoming a guiding figure of the Florentine mandolin and guitar school, which also included such illustrious students as Queen Margherita. In 1890 he organized and conducted the first plucked string quartet, with Luigi Bianchi on first mandolin, Guido Vizzarri on second mandolin, Riccardo Matini on mandola and himself on liuto moderno. With this quartet he performed several concerts across Italy, popularizing this kind of ensemble. In 1892 the quartet won first prize in the National Competition of Genoa, over which the famous violinist Camillo Sivori presided. In the same competition Munier won the gold medal as mandolin player and composer performing his \\"Concerto in Sol maggiore\\". In October 1909 he performed for King Vittorio Emanuele III, in the historical castle of Sommariva-Perno in Cuneo province, playing the \\"Prelude in Re maggiore\\" and the Mazurka-Concert \\"A Lei!\\". The king complimented Munier on the execution of the pieces and the extraordinary effects he obtained with the mandolin. In autumn 1910, Munier left for a European tour that made stops in Marseilles and Antwerp. In Marseilles, he met his mandolinist friend Laurent Fantauzzi to whom he told of his plan to organize an impressive concert in Florence. Unfortunately, he never realized the event; on his return to Florence Munier contracted an unexpected illness and died on February 10, 1911, after an unexpected illness. Munier first married Luisa De Fonseca, who died young and to whom he dedicated Elegia op 148. He then married Armida Bastianini with whom he had two daughters, Luisa and Elena. Compositions Munier was a prolific composer. His catalogue includes more than 350 published works. With the exception of a few works, including the \\"Trio for mandolin, violoncello and piano\\" and the \\"Three quartets for 2 mandolins, mandola and lute\\", Munier wrote primarily for mandolin and guitar. His production of methods was also remarkable: the Metodo completo for mandolin in two volumes; Lo Scioglidita in four volumes and the Venti Studi. His ouvre also included didactic works like the \\"Lezioni in Forma di Duetto\\" Op. 115 and the Opere per Due Mandolini (Op. 220, 228 and 230). =Krick's selections= Educational works In the Etude magazine, January 1941, George C.

Cederstr√∂m enlisted in the Swedish admiralty in 1779 and as captain, he conducted a raid against Rogervik. He distinguished himself in 1790 at the naval Battle of Reval and the Battle of Viborg Bay. During the following years he led ships against privateers in the North Sea. He was sent in 1801 to fight alongside the United States Navy in the Mediterranean during the First Barbary War. In 1808 his ships were sent to blockade Gotland in order to repel a Russian invasion . His last military action was against Denmark and France in 1813, when he helped Swedish forces capture Vorpommern. In 1815, he was appointed a minister but returned to the navy in 1818. He finally resigned in 1828. Career Cederstr√∂m was born in Landskrona, Sweden, the son of Claes Cederstr√∂m and his wife Margareta Elisabet von Mevius. He was a student in Uppsala in 1776 and was admitted to war service at the Admiralty in 1779. Cederstr√∂m became a petty officer (arklim√§stare) at the Admiralty on 3 August 1779 and was promoted to f√§nrik on 5 June 1781.

He distinguished himself during the Russo-Swedish War 1788‚Äì90 when he conducted a successful expedition to Rogervik (17 March 1790) as the commander of a small squadron of two frigates and a few brigs, where timber to a Russian archipelago fleet and much other military equipment was destroyed. For this he was appointed major on 26 March 1790. Cederstr√∂m also distinguished himself during the Battle of Reval (13 May 1790) and the Battle of Vyborg Bay (4 July 1790). He became √∂verstel√∂jtnant at the Admiralty on 25 February 1793. Cederstr√∂m became a member of the Committee of the Navy's Equipment on 22 April 1794 and √∂verste at the Admiralty on 21 June 1795.

History In 1987, Willy Clijsters, professor French as Foreign Language (FLE) at the Hasselt University and president of DiWeF, the association of Flemish teachers FLE, launched \\"La Tour Eiffel - Concours de Fran√ßais\\". This contest consisted of a written selection test of 100 multiple choice questions in three different categories, followed by a classification interview in front of a mixed jury of teachers and representatives of the business world. The elimination question lists are mainly centred on everyday communication and have been developed in a contrastive approach. This means that the questions are partially written in the source language, Dutch. The initiative, which was launched in 1988 to make the teaching of French more dynamic for youngsters in the Belgian province of Limburg, welcomed about 1,200 participants from all over Flanders. Soon, all the Flemish universities (Leuven - Kortrijk - Ghent - Antwerp - Brussels) joined the organization. Growing very quickly and strongly since, LTECF has received in each of the last few years of the competitions about 5.000 candidates. Meanwhile, the contest changed name and is now called \\"the Flemish Olympiad for French‚Äù (Olyfran). As part of this activity, every year 400 multiple choice question on the French language are drawn up by secondary school teachers and academics.

Retail concentration is not simply a concentration ratio as is emerging in the food sector. This is due to two factors: the particular relevance retail is gaining on a global scale, and the particular shape of the food supply chain. In recent years, Retail Concentration moved ahead with fusions and acquisitionshttp://www.capgemini.com/resources/news/consumers_drive_food_industry_transformationglobal_brands_retail_formats_consolidationsays_new_report/ along the entire food supply chain. We can assume with Grievink (2003) that in a few years there will be only 5 dominant actors in the globalised food chain. The same researcher states that in the 90's the top-5 food manufacturers could count on twice the cash flow of the top-5 retailers. Nowadays the relation is inverted: the top 5 retailers can count on twice that of the top-5 manufacturers. Thus, the food chain has become increasingly vertically integrated, with global corporations able to coordinate inputs from the seed to the field, from the stable to the table. Retail concentration by one hand is the answer that retail is giving to compete with the giants of agrofood industry. By the other hand, is the agrofood industry in itself searching to arrive directly to the consumers, through a refined relations system. In this process, private labels are increasingly attracting consumers, and are expected to grow more and more on their fidelisation strategy, beating on quality, safety and also ethical values.http://www.foodinternational.net/articles/efi-special/583/private- labels-why-europe-is-leading-the-pack.html Recently the European Commissionhttp://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/thematic_articles/article13524_en.htm proposed solutions to face with overall price increase about foodstuff. Among the measures proposed, several relate to the retail power recently acquired. In particular, the payments delay to the producers; the additional fees asked to the producers to place on the shelves branded products; price transparency; better regulation on promotional activities and openings/closing time are all issues on the agenda. For supporters, retail concentration means more chances for consumers, lower prices, better quality. For opponents, by the contrary, the disappearing of traditional shops, of food culture, of neighborhood life in general.International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity, 2006 3: 33 ‚ÄúUnderstanding environmental influences on nutrition and physical activity behaviors: where should we look and what should we count?‚Äù, Kylie Ball, Anna F Timperio and David A Crawford Furthermore, too much concentration means squeezing the price of industry and of agriculture, which can lead to outsourcing food from anywhere it can cost less, without a truly long term impact assessment. Tim Lang (Food Wars, Earthscan London 2004) described the retail concentration phenomenon such as a \\"food war\\", in which winners and losers take place. Tim Lang talks about \\"food clusters\\" ([p. 84]) to better handle the idea of concentration along the entire food chain. There are a lot of legal instruments which allow to get more and more concentrated. Acquisition being the first one, follow mergers, joint ventures, partnerships and more not formalised contracts/ agreements. Note that the \\"hypermarketization\\" is not limited to the Western World, but supermarkets rise fast also in the less developed countries and in the East and in the South of the World. . Regarding that, there are a lot of concerns, pretending that the overwhelming power of retailing is making poorer and poorer farmers, in particular in the LDC (Less Developed Countries).http://www.agobservatory.org/library.cfm?RefID=46604 The \\"crowding out\\" effect on local agricultures it is basically due to the global sourcing of the produces, wherever they cost less and offer more. To say it with the words of the Italian food-thinker Corrado Finardi to fairly function, the agricultural system has a different, slower timeline than the market (in agriculture counts the long term investment, while on the global market it is more important the precise moment in which supply and demand match). Market concentration (considering the upper and lower tails) A more refined form, which calculates the percentage of last 4/ competitors on the first 4/5. Eve in its static version, it measures the level of competition in the sector. A diachronic comparison allows for even more insights. Herfindahl Hirschman Index This index is used in Europe and in the USA for antitrust regulatory purposes, in order to assess the feasibility of mergers and acquisitions. The HHI is calculated as the relative frequencies squared and summed, comprehensive of all actors in the playfield. So far, it gives more importance to biggest player in proportion. Even if interesting, a HHI, often wrongly assess the real behaviours on the field. Consider, for the comparison sake, the retail concentration in Europe. Top 5 retail distributors account for the 70% of the market share. Even if apparently it gives the idea of a highly concentrated market, the HHI does not allow for that conclusion in most of the cases. Following 3 different scenarios, we explored the relative market shares of the single actors. 1 scenario: 1= 19%, 2=15%, 3=14%, 4= 12%, 5=10% (total=70% for the top 5), remaining= 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 7%, 9%. In this first case, where there is a linear distribution of market share among players, the HHI scores at 0,121 (considered a moderate concentration indicator) 2 scenario: 14% *5 (top 5 players =70%, having equal market share), the remaining, each equalling 3% (3%*10). In this second case, the HHI scores an 0,098, which stands for an unconcentrated market at all. We can deliberately make some reflections on that, since the HHI seems not taking into account opportunistic behaviours in the direction of oligopoly. It is assumed that, because of the equal market power of the top 5 actors, they are going to compete (even if history shows that more probably they find some form of implicit agreement‚Ä¶). Standardised from 0 to 1, the value is 0,033571429 (very low‚Ä¶). 3 scenario. First player= 20%, followers 12%, then 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 4% and the last 10 each 3%. In this case the HHI is 0,0944 (not concentrated market, even if not highly competitive environment). Standardised from 0 to 1, the value is 0,0378 (very low‚Ä¶). Even in a case where there is one leading competitor which ‚Äúmakes the market‚Äù as in the 3rd scenario, the HHI stays relatively low.

Three of the hides sit on the largest of the three lochs with the other being on the South Loch.Map of Morton Lochs National Nature Reserve  History  Morton Lochs is not a naturally occurring wetland system; it was made by local land owners, the Christie family, in 1906.Morton Lochs NNR They initially flooded this area of dune heath for fishing, but it quickly became an important centre for wintering wildfowl. Perhaps the most notable visitor is the teal, which comes in its hundreds at times according to entries made in the record book in the hide. The teal is also the emblem for the NNR, and appears on signs at the entrance to the reserve. Morton Lochs was defined as an NNR in 1952, at the time being the second NNR in the UK.  Biodiversity  The surrounding woodland of Morton Lochs and Tentsmuir are an important habitat for the red squirrel, which can often be seen right outside the John Berry hide. Bird feeders are placed around the woodland and outside the John Berry hide and attract a range of tits, finches and great spotted woodpecker. Wildfowl visitors to the loch include water rail, goldeneye, little grebe, teal, mallard, moorhen, greylag goose, mute swan and many more. Other sightings have included kingfisher, marsh harrier, osprey and otters.

US 212 in Minnesota has an official length of . It is an urban freeway within the Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul area and is mostly a two-lane rural road elsewhere in the state. Prior to the establishment of the United States Numbered Highway System, most of the US 212 corridor in Minnesota was part the transcontinental auto trail known as the Yellowstone Trail, which was established in 1917. US 212 was established in 1926 but originally terminated at US 12 in the city of Willmar from 1926 to 1934. US 212 was shifted to its current alignment around 1934, continuing slightly east of its current terminus to end at then US 12 in Saint Paul until 1982, when US 212 was truncated to Edina. In 2008, the Twin Cities portion of US 212 was relocated to a new freeway (formerly designated as State Highway 312 from 2003 to 2008). US 212 in Minnesota did not terminate at its eastern point at hwy 62 in Edina. It continued easterly through St. Paul, through Lake Elmo and terminated in Stillwater near the Wisconsin border. Route description US 212 in Minnesota passes through seven counties in the southern part of the state, from the South Dakota state line to the Twin Cities area. It runs in straight east‚Äìwest course from the South Dakota line across prairie land to the city of Montevideo. From there the route follows the valley of the Minnesota River to Granite Falls. It then leaves the Minnesota River valley to pass through farming areas until Glencoe, where the terrain gradually becomes more hilly as the road continues east. As the route approaches the Twin Cities, the road becomes a freeway running parallel to, but not within, the Minnesota River valley. US 212 ends at the junction of US 169 and MN 62 in the Minneapolis suburb of Edina. The entire length of US 212 in Minnesota is officially designated the Minnesota Veterans Memorial Highway. Legally, the Minnesota section of US 212 is defined as Legislative Routes 155, 12, 187, and 260 in the Minnesota Statutes. The route is not marked with those numbers. =South Dakota to Granite Falls= US 212 crosses into Minnesota from South Dakota, traveling through flat, open terrain. About from the state line, it intersects with US 75, then enters the small city of Dawson several miles later. US 212 continues past Dawson through more fertile prairie land, eventually being joined by US 59\\\\. The overlapped routes pass by the entrance to Camp Release State Park, a park where the former Sioux village of Chief Red Iron was located, and which also contains a granite monument commemorating the release of 269 prisoners from Sioux captivity. US 212 and US 59 split in the western edge of the city of Montevideo in the valley of the Minnesota River; US 59 heads northwest, and US 212 heads southeast. US 212 follows the Minnesota valley for about to the city of Granite Falls. In the center of the city, MN 23 joins US 212 briefly as they cross the Minnesota River; the two routes split soon after leaving the eastern city limits. The city of Granite Falls is known as the hometown of Andrew Volstead, who authored the National Prohibition Act. =Granite Falls to Glencoe= East of Granite Falls, US 212 leaves the Minnesota River valley, heading due east across a variety of farming areas in the south central portion of the state. For the next , US 212 passes through a series of small cities in this area: Sacred Heart, Renville, Danube, and Olivia. In Olivia, the county seat of Renville County, U.S. 212 meets US 71\\\\. US 212 continues due east through more farmland, again passing through a series of small cities that developed along the route. Through the next of the road, US 212 goes through Bird Island, Hector (intersecting MN 4), Buffalo Lake, Stewart and Brownton (intersecting MN 15). Brownton, which is located on Buffalo Creek, is the site of the Sioux Uprising, one of the earliest massacres of white settlers in the region. Several miles later, US 212 is joined by MN 22; US 212 becomes a four-lane divided highway heading east into the city of Glencoe closely following Buffalo Creek. MN 22 splits off to the north in downtown Glencoe, while US 212 heads east out of the city. =Glencoe to the Twin Cities area= East of Glencoe, the terrain becomes progressively more hilly as US 212 continues eastward. US 212 is joined by MN 5 and MN 25 about after leaving Glencoe. The three overlapped routes continue east into the city of Norwood Young America for about , after which MN 5 and MN 25 split off to the north in the center of the city. After leaving Norwood Young America, US 212 becomes a two-lane road, passing by several lakes, continuing east for several miles to the city of Cologne. It then runs into the community of Dahlgren. East of Dahlgren, US 212 becomes a freeway as it heads into the Twin Cities area. The freeway runs along the northwest upland of the Minnesota River valley. After the first interchange on the freeway with Jonathan Carver Parkway, US 212 enters the city limits of Chaska. The road then curves to the north. It has an interchange with Big Woods Boulevard that was constructed in late 2019. It crosses over Chaska Creek, and has an interchange with Engler Boulevard before turning northeastward. The freeway meets with MN 41\\\\. Less than later, the freeway enters the city of Chanhassen, where it has two interchanges and passes by several lakes. US 212 then crosses into Hennepin County and into the city of Eden Prairie. US 212 is joined by MN 5 in Eden Prairie for about as they travel eastward. The overlap with MN 5 ends at the cloverleaf interchange with Interstate 494 (I-494). At the boundary between Eden Prairie and Edina, US 212 parallels MN 62, and the two highways have a junction with US 169\\\\. US 212 officially ends at the eastern limit of this interchange in Edina, where eastbound US 212 merges into eastbound MN 62\\\\. MN 62 continues the roadway into the city of Minneapolis. History =Auto trails= Most of the route of present-day US 212 between Montevideo and Norwood Young America was originally designated as part of the transcontinental auto trail known as the Yellowstone Trail, which was conceived in 1912. The Yellowstone Trail stretched from Seattle, Washington, via Yellowstone National Park, to Plymouth, Massachusetts. The auto trail route in Minnesota was officially recognized by the Minnesota Highway Department in 1917.Minnesota Highway Department Trail Certification East of Norwood Young America, the Yellowstone Trail utilized MN 5, shifting to Excelsior Boulevard via the Minnewashta Parkway to reach Minneapolis. West of Montevideo, the Yellowstone Trail used present day MN 7 to US 12. The westernmost section of present-day US 212, from the South Dakota line to Montevideo, was also part of another auto trail known as the Short Cut West Highway. This auto trail went on a direct route between Minneapolis and Yellowstone National Park. The Yellowstone Trail also connects Minneapolis with Yellowstone National Park but travels a longer, more circuitous route through many populated centers. Between Montevideo and the Twin Cities area, the Short Cut West Highway ran along MN 7 until Lake Minnewashta, where it ended at the Yellowstone Trail.Dave Schul - National Auto Trails =Designation as a U.S. Highway= In 1926, the United States Numbered Highway System was implemented in the country. US 212 was originally designated as a route that connected US 85 in Belle Fourche, South Dakota, with US 12 in Willmar, Minnesota. In 1934, US 212 was extended east to Saint Paul along mostly its modern alignment. In the Twin Cities area, US 212 utilized Flying Cloud Drive and Vernon Avenue to reach Excelsior Boulevard. It then followed Lake Street through Minneapolis, crossing the Mississippi River into Saint Paul and becoming Marshall Avenue, finally ending at then US 12 in downtown Saint Paul. In 1983, US 212 was truncated to end at US 169 in Edina, disconnecting US 212 from US 12, its parent route. =Construction= The paving of US 212 in Minnesota began in 1928 and the route was completely paved by 1940. The earliest sections to be paved were the roads east of MN 15, which was paved by 1929. The portion of the route in Renville County was paved by 1931, while the portion between US 75 and Granite Falls was paved between 1932 and 1934. The portion west of US 75 had originally been a county road and was only added to the state highway system in 1934. Paving of this section was finished in 1938. The portion that overlapped MN 5 was paved by 1940.MnDOT Construction Project logs (See control sections 3705, 3706, 8713, 1212, 8712, 1211, 6510, 6511, 6512, 309, 4310, 1012, 1013, 2744, 2745, 2701) Over the next few decades, several sections of the road were reconstructed as four-lanes divided highways. The four-lane road between Glencoe and Norwood Young America was completed in 1959. The expressway approach in the vicinity of I-494 was completed by 1971. Several other segments were reconstructed in 1990, namely the old Flying Cloud Drive alignment, which became a four-lane divided surface arterial, and the MN 5 overlap, which became an expressway. The section of the route between Glencoe and Chaska currently alternates between a , four-lane expressway and a two-lane roadway. A four-way stop sign in Glencoe is located within the expressway segment of the route. Counties and cities along US 212 are lobbying to extend the four-lane divided highway west of Glencoe. The Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) is considering the proposal. From Hector to MN 22 near Glencoe, the route is planned to be reconstructed with passing lanes. =MN 312= Between Eden Prairie and Chaska, US 212 was relocated in July 2008 to a new, more northerly, freeway alignment. During planning and construction, the new freeway was given the temporary designation of MN 312. On April 29, 2002, former U.S. Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta was in the Twin Cities for an announcement regarding transportation in Minnesota. Mineta presented a $2.9 million check (Federal Highway Administration grant) to state transportation officials. The $2.9 million is part of the $238 million funding for the new freeway alignment of US 212 in Eden Prairie, Chanhassen, and Chaska. The groundbreaking celebration on August 20, 2005, was held in Chaska. On December 7, 2007, a portion of the project from Dell Road in Eden Prairie to MN 41 in Chaska opened to traffic, giving drivers use of about half of the new freeway alignment. It was signed using its temporary designation of MN 312. On July 14, 2008, the remaining portion of the project from MN 41 to just west of Carver opened to traffic. The new freeway has a designated shoulder on both sides for a planned bus rapid transit route extending from Carver to points eastward along the freeway. Soon after the completion of MN 312, the MN 312 route designation was retired and US 212 was relocated onto the new freeway. The former surface alignment of US 212 along Flying Cloud Drive was turned back to the maintenance of Carver and Hennepin counties as County Road 61.

Stage History and reception Ascertaining the exact number of performances of Bellamira presents some problems. It is a fact that Bellamira was performed by the United Company in the Drury Lane Theatre on 12 May 1687. Bellamira may also have been performed in the Dorset Garden Theatre. However, as it was a standard play, without fancy scenery or machinery, the Drury Lane Theatre is the most likely place of performance.Judith Milhous and Robert D. Hume, \\"Attribution Problems in English Drama, 1660‚Äì1700,\\" Harvard Library Bulletin, 31 (1983), 10. According to The London Stage, 12 May, however, may not be regarded as the premi√®re.See The London Stage 1660‚Äì1800, ed. William Van Lennep, Vol. I, p. 358 It is uncertain how many performances followed in the season of 1687/88, and there may have been a revival of the play in the season of 1690/91.See John Downes, Roscius Anglicanus, ed. Montague Summers (London,1928), p. 43 At least two sources testify that Bellamira was not a failure in spite of obvious criticism from parts of the audience. The first testimony is that of Thomas Shadwell, who, in his Tenth Satyr of Juvenal (1687), which is dedicated to Sedley, thanks Sir Charles for his patronage, adding: \\"Your late great obligation in giving me the advantage of your Comedy, call‚Äôd Bellamira, or the Mistress, has given me a fresh subject for my Thanks ... I am heartily glad that your Comedy (as I never doubted) found such success, that I never met with any Man of Sence but applauded it\\" (The Complete Works of Thomas Shadwell, ed. Montague Summers, Vol. V, p. 291). The phrase \\"advantage\\" here presumably means that Sedley offered Shadwell, a Whig out of favour and debarred from the theatre in the mid-1680s, the third night's income to support him. If this is correct, Bellamira was performed more often than two times.Shirley Strum Kenny, \\"The Publication of Plays,\\" The London Theatre World, 1660‚Äì1800, ed. Robert D. Hume (Carbondale and Edwardsville, 1980), p. 310. The second source of the play's success is that it went into print within six weeks after the premi√®re.Judith Milhous and Robert D. Hume, \\"Dating Play Premi√®res from Publication Data, 1660‚Äì1700,\\" Harvard Library Bulletin, 22 (1974), p. 390. However, instant publication does not necessarily speak in favour of a play's success, since even prompt copies of unsuccessful plays were sent to the printer.See Kenny, \\"Publication of Plays,\\" p. 315. Evidence about the success of Bellamira is not consistent, however. In his Preface to Bellamira, Sedley himself refers to a rather cool reception of his comedy. He seems to have attributed this to a latent element of obscenity. In Sedley's view, female spectators with their increasing demand for morals and manners on the stage, showed a particular dislike of this kind of lasciviousness in comedy.John Harrington Smith, \\"Shadwell, the Ladies, and the Change in Comedy,\\" Modern Philology, 46 (1948), 22‚Äì33; see also Robert D. Hume, \\"‚ÄòThe Change in Comedy‚Äô: Cynical versus Exemplary Comedy on the London Stage, 1678‚Äì1693,\\" Essays in Theatre, 1 (1982), pp. 101‚Äì18. Contemporary authors who spoke in favour of Bellamira again include Shadwell and George Etherege. Shadwell defended Bellamira from the charge of obscenity.Works of Shadwell, ed. Summers, Vol. V, p. 291. Etherege, who served as diplomat at the Imperial Court in Ratisbon between 1685 and 1689 and was bored there, apparently found reading Bellamira a welcome change.The Letters of Sir George Etherege, ed. Frederick Bracher (London, 1974), p. 96. Bellamira saw no further editions after 1687. This means that it cannot have been a smash hit. Nor does it occur in the list of the most successful plays between 1660 and 1747 which were still performed after 1900. And yet, Bellamira was adapted by Robin Chapman and broadcast on 18 March 1975 by Thames Television under the title \\"Way of the World: Bellamira\\".See J. L. Styan, Comedy in Performance (Cambridge, 1986), p. 258, and Retta M. Taney, Restoration Revivals on the British Stage (1944‚Äì1979). A Critical Survey (Boston and London, 1985). (Stock) Characters and Couples * Merryman and Thisbe (Falstaffian drunkard meets Bellamira's confidante) * Keepwell and Bellamira (Fool meets scheming heroine) * Dangerfield and Bellamira (miles gloriosus is fooled by scheming heroine) * Lionel and Isabella (alleged eunuch and excessive rake meets and rapes helpless ing√©nue) * Cunningham (old syphilitic rake) * Eustace (another rake, friend of Merryman) * Smoothly (Dangerfield's servant) * Pisquil (the real eunuch) * Silence and Betty (servant girls) Inversion of traditional hierarchies in the plot Bellamira is full of relationships and affairs, and only one couple is married on stage while more marriages are only planned for the future. However, all the marriages are doubtful as to how close they function as satiric norm(s). Traditional hierarchies and ties of interdependence are inverted. Previously unprivileged members of society dominate the plot. The ones formerly in power either have to pay for their status quo or have to submit to survive: * Bellamira, the daughter of a bankrupt merchant, turns courtesan and takes advantage of her indulgent keeper's wealth to manipulate her male admirers from her luxurious residence. * Isabella, a gentlewoman by birth, is degraded to a state of slavery: she is kidnapped as a child, bought by the bragging Dangerfield, sold as a present to Bellamira, kept by Bellamira as a pawn and finally raped by an overardent lover. * Having originally come from an (impoverished) family of the gentry, Smoothly turns parasitic sycophant to serve his master, Dangerfield. * Finally, the (alleged) eunuch turns out to be a rapist. It is Lionel's deed in particular that propels the plot and brings about the climactic effects in the play. * Perhaps only Thisbe and Merryman are a match for each other, despite the moral deficiencies accompanying the couple. The proviso scene testifies to their mutual consent to marry each other at last. The marriage of Thisbe and Merryman, then, presents a norm, however limited, within the play. Both feel affection for one another, and their marriage is as free of (pretended) romanticism (Isabella / Lionel) as it is of deceptive selfishness (Bellamira / Keepwell). Criticism of competitive society The criticism of contemporary society in Bellamira is achieved by satire and parody.For a detailed analysis of the play, see Sir Charles Sedley's \\"The Mulberry-Garden\\" (1668) and \\"Bellamira: or, The Mistress\\" (1687), ed. Hanowell. The play presents the picture of a competitive society which is largely characterised by materialistic and cynical as well as libertinistic, if not nihilistic, tendencies. The society of Bellamira is morally corrupt and profit-seeking, degenerate, cunning and violent. Established standards of conduct, codes of honour and polite conversation all serve to cover up the prevalent hypocrisy. The motif of sterility and disease in the play In Bellamira, a profit-seeking attitude has infected every aspect of life and ruined each relationship. Materialistic motives lead to arranged marriages devoid of feelings and love. The society delineated here is an ageing society not only morally deficient but also literally diseased: Bellamira is a veteran courtesan; Merryman an elderly drunkard; Cunningham a crumbling syphilitic wretch; Dangerfield an old-fashioned, impotent soldier in retirement. In addition to this picture of ageing and disease, the imagery of sterility receives special emphasis in the play: the device of the eunuch becomes the very symbol of the play, and thus, characteristics such as incompleteness and lack of fulfilment dominate the play. While characters like Dangerfield and Merryman suffer from physical impotence, others like Lionel are emotionally sterile. In his raving, Lionel commits a crime by raping the girl he professes to love. Keepwell, too, who is ruled by a courtesan, seems less than a man. The pervasive animal imagery underlines this impression: Pisquil, the real eunuch, is called \\"Humane Gelding,\\" Dangerfield \\"gelt\\" by Bellamira, and Merryman refers to him as \\"Gib‚Äôd Cat,\\" that is, gelded cat. In a final piece of irony, the lean Cunningham refers to himself as a \\"Capon,\\" that is, gelded cock.

A kind system is essentially a simply typed lambda calculus \\"one level up\\", endowed with a primitive type, denoted * and called \\"type\\", which is the kind of any data type which does not need any type parameters. A kind is sometimes confusingly described as the \\"type of a (data) type\\", but it is actually more of an arity specifier. Syntactically, it is natural to consider polymorphic types to be type constructors, thus non- polymorphic types to be nullary type constructors. But all nullary constructors, thus all monomorphic types, have the same, simplest kind; namely *. Since higher-order type operators are uncommon in programming languages, in most programming practice, kinds are used to distinguish between data types and the types of constructors which are used to implement parametric polymorphism. Kinds appear, either explicitly or implicitly, in languages whose type systems account for parametric polymorphism in a programatically accessible way, such as C++, Haskell and Scala.Generics of a Higher Kind  Examples  * *, pronounced \\"type\\", is the kind of all data types seen as nullary type constructors, and also called proper types in this context. This normally includes function types in functional programming languages. \\\\rightarrow * is the kind of a unary type constructor, e.g. of a list type constructor. \\\\rightarrow * \\\\rightarrow * is the kind of a binary type constructor (via currying), e.g. of a pair type constructor, and also that of a function type constructor (not to be confused with the result of its application, which itself is a function type, thus of kind *) * (* \\\\rightarrow *) \\\\rightarrow * is the kind of a higher-order type operator from unary type constructors to proper types. Pierce (2002), chapter 32  Kinds in Haskell  (Note: Haskell documentation uses the same arrow for both function types and kinds.) The kind system of Haskell 98Kinds - The Haskell 98 Report includes exactly two kinds: **, pronounced \\"type\\" is the kind of all data types. *k_1 \\\\rightarrow k_2 is the kind of a unary type constructor, which takes a type of kind k_1 and produces a type of kind k_2. An inhabited type (as proper types are called in Haskell) is a type which has values. For instance, ignoring type classes which complicate the picture, \`4\` is a value of type \`Int\`, while \`[1, 2, 3]\` is a value of type \`[Int]\` (list of Ints). Therefore, \`Int\` and \`[Int]\` have kind *, but so does any function type, for instance \`Int -> Bool\` or even \`Int -> Int -> Bool\`. A type constructor takes one or more type arguments, and produces a data type when enough arguments are supplied, i.e. it supports partial application thanks to currying. This is how Haskell achieves parametric types. For instance, the type \`[]\` (list) is a type constructor - it takes a single argument to specify the type of the elements of the list. Hence, \`[Int]\` (list of Ints), \`[Float]\` (list of Floats) and even \` Int \` (list of lists of Ints) are valid applications of the \`[]\` type constructor. Therefore, \`[]\` is a type of kind * \\\\rightarrow *. Because \`Int\` has kind *, applying \`[]\` to it results in \`[Int]\`, of kind *. The 2-tuple constructor \`(,)\` has kind * \\\\rightarrow * \\\\rightarrow *, the 3-tuple constructor \`(,,)\` has kind * \\\\rightarrow * \\\\rightarrow * \\\\rightarrow * and so on. = Kind inference = Standard Haskell does not allow polymorphic kinds. This is in contrast to parametric polymorphism on types, which is supported in Haskell. For instance, in the following example: data Tree z = Leaf  Fork (Tree z) (Tree z) the kind of \`z\` could be anything, including *, but also * \\\\rightarrow * etc. Haskell by default will always infer kinds to be *, unless the type explicitly indicates otherwise (see below). Therefore the type checker will reject the following use of \`Tree\`: type FunnyTree = Tree [] -- invalid because the kind of \`[]\`, * \\\\rightarrow * does not match the expected kind for \`z\`, which is always *. Higher-order type operators are allowed however. For instance: data App unt z = Z (unt z) has kind (* \\\\rightarrow *) \\\\rightarrow * \\\\rightarrow *, i.e. \`unt\` is expected to be a unary data constructor, which gets applied to its argument, which must be a type, and returns another type. GHC has the extension \`PolyKinds\`, which, together with \`KindSignatures\`, allows polymorphic kinds. For example: data Tree (z :: k) = Leaf  Fork (Tree z) (Tree z) type FunnyTree = Tree [] -- OK Since GHC 8.0.1, types and kinds are merged.https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/8.0.1/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html#ghc- flag--XTypeInType  See also  * System F-omega * Pure type system  References  * , chapter 29, \\"Type Operators and Kinding\\" Type theory Data types ","title":"Kind (type theory)"},{"id":"20627469","text":"James Ralph \\"Jim\\" Dunbar (July 17, 1930 - May 14, 2018) was an American competition rower and Olympic champion.

Christians√∏ (1920) Edvard Weie The Bornholm school of painters (Bornholmerskolen) started to take shape towards the beginning of the 20th century on the Danish island of Bornholm when a number of artists developed a distinctive style of classic modernism, inspired by the island's unique landscapes and light. It was not characterized by a uniform artistic line, but rather by its experiments with color, abstraction and cubism. By the end of the 19th century, artists such as Otto Haslund had taken inspiration on the island. In the early 1900s, Karl Isakson (1878-1922) and Edvard Weie (1879-1943) were among those who were inspired by the island's constantly changing natural beauty, using pure, subdued colour to produce work in new aesthetic directions. They were soon joined by other Danish artists including Oluf H√∏st (1884-1966), Olaf Rude (1886-1957), Kr√¶sten Iversen (1886-1955) and Niels Lergaard (1893-1982), They lived mainly in the picturesque little ports of Gudhjem and Svaneke on the northern coast, adventuring at times over to the small island of Christians√∏ where they found further seclusion and inspiration.

BCT was founded in 1991 and is the only national organisation solely devoted to bats.About Us - Bat Conservation Trust Its vision is a world where bats and people live in harmony. BCT currently has a membership of around 5,600, including individuals, families, teachers and youth workers and corporate businesses. BCT‚Äôs work is based on four key objectives, which are seen as critical to maintaining a sustainable, diverse bat population in the UK: * To determine target population levels and associated habitats * To secure and maintain the stated target bat population levels * To act as the authoritative voice for bat conservation * To win the required level of support to achieve the target number of bats.  National Bat Helpline  BCT runs the National Bat Helpline, providing information to anyone needing advice on issues relating to bats, and connecting people with local bat carers and volunteers if necessary. The helpline received over 13,000 enquiries in 2013. Users can telephone the helpline directly (on 0345 1300 228) or submit queries via a form on BCT's website. = Hours = * From October to April (non-peak season): Monday- Friday, 9 am-5:30 pm * From May to September (peak season): in addition to non-peak season hours, the Out of Hours Helpline, run by volunteers, is available in the evenings and on weekends.http://www.bats.org.uk/pages/bat_helpline.html  National Bat Monitoring Programme  The National Bat Monitoring Programme (NBMP) was launched in 1996 and consists of a number of national, annual surveys carried out by a network of volunteers across the UK. The NBMP is a partnership between Bat Conservation Trust (BCT), Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC), Defra and Natural Resources Wales (NRW). Natural England (NE) also contribute to the programme. BCT runs NBMP surveys aimed at beginners as well as experts, and their current surveys include the Sunset/Sunrise survey, Field Survey, Waterway Survey, Roost Count, Hibernation Survey, Woodland Survey and Nathusius‚Äô Pipistrelle Survey. The results from these surveys are compiled into an annual report, available to view on the BCT website.http://www.bats.org.uk/pages/nbmp_annual_report.html Currently, statistically robust trends are produced for 11 of the UK‚Äôs 17 breeding species. NBMP data support and inform conservation action and key government biodiversity and monitoring and reporting including UK and country biodiversity strategies,http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/page-5701 the Habitats Directive http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/page-1374 and the UN Eurobats agreement.http://www.eurobats.org/ NBMP data from selected species are used to produce one of the annual UK Biodiversity Indicators, high-level measures which are used to report on progress towards meeting goals and targets for the conservation of biological diversity.http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/page-4233  Nathusius' pipistrelle Bat Survey  In 2009, as part of the National Bat Monitoring Programme, BCT began the first systematic UK-wide survey of Nathusius‚Äô pipistrelles in order to improve knowledge of the distribution of this species. Nathusius‚Äô pipistrelle is considered to be rare in the UK but is widespread and may be under-recorded in some areas. As this species is often found at large water bodies, particularly during the autumn migration period, the survey involves surveying lakes twice during September, and making audio recordings from broadband bat detectors in order to verify Nathusius‚Äô pipistrelle calls through sonogram analysis. Although data gained from the survey are still quite limited, there are indications that Nathusius' pipistrelle may be relatively widespread across lakes in some regions in the autumn. From results up to 2013 Greater London showed the highest percentage of sites with analysed recordings that had verified records (83.3%) followed by North East (69.2%), Northern Ireland (57.1%) and East of England (50%).http://www.bats.org.uk/pages/nath_pip_survey_results.html All other regions had at least three sites with confirmed recordings of Nathusius‚Äô pipistrelle. As of 2013, 192 volunteers have taken part and 230 sites have been surveyed. BCT encourages its members and volunteers to take part, particularly in areas where there are gaps in survey coverage, and the necessary equipment for the survey can be borrowed from their office.  Bat Crime Investigations Project  Under the Wildlife and Countryside Act of 1981 all UK bat species and their roosts became protected by law. Due to their low reproduction rates and long life-spans, bat populations are particularly vulnerable to a range of threats including bat related crimes. BCT also runs a Bat Crime Investigations Project which aims to; * Record bat related crimes, * Provide training and advice for the police, SNCOs and bat workers to ensure incidents are reported and investigated, and that the law is enforced with appropriate prosecutions, * Educate the groups and sectors that perpetrate bat related crime, and create awareness raising initiatives such as the production of best practice guidelines to improve work practices, * Improve areas of UK policy to reduce opportunities for ignoring the legislative protection given to bats. The Bat Crime Investigations Project also aims to uphold the protection for bats as detailed in the Wildlife and Countryside Act (1981), which criminalised the following; * Deliberately capturing, injuring or killing a bat, * Intentionally or recklessly disturbing a bat in its roost or deliberately disturbing a group of bats, * Damaging or destroying a bat roosting place (even if bats are not occupying the roost at the time), * Possessing or advertising/selling/exchanging a bat (dead or alive) or any part of a bat, * Intentionally or recklessly obstructing access to a bat roost.http://www.bats.org.uk/pages/bats_and_the_law.html  Magazines  BCT produces two members only magazines; Bat News and The Young Bat Worker. BCT also produces a number of publications sent out to its members and the general public with bat information and advice regarding a number of topics including UK bat species, living with bats and gardening for bats. The BCT email bulletin is sent out every two months with current news stories relating to the organisation and general bat conservation. It has a readership of around 10,000. = Bat News = The first issue of Bat News was published in September 1984, and the magazine is now published three times a year. Bat News features news, research updates and in-depth features regarding the organization and its work. = The Young Bat Worker = The Young Bat Worker is BCT's magazine for their Young Batworkers‚Äô Club, specifically for members under 16 years old. It features bat-themed activities, games, stories, competitions and curriculum guidance for teachers and is also published three times a year.  Bat groups  BCT provides support for over 90 bat groups across the UK. The groups are made up of dedicated volunteers and vary in size, ranging from a few individuals to groups with hundreds of members. Bat groups organise and carry out frontline conservation. The activities each group undertakes will vary but include surveys and monitoring projects, leading bat walks and giving talks, research projects, bat care and rehabilitation. Individual groups run local fundraising events for their group and BCT. Visitors to BCT‚Äôs website can find their local bat group at http://www.bats.org.uk/pages/local_bat_groups.html.  Events, Training and Awards  BCT runs the annual National Bat Conference which takes place across one weekend in September. The conference programme includes talks, workshops and the presentation of both the Vincent Weir and Pete Guest Awards. BCT also runs a number of training courses throughout the year for both volunteers and professionals. = The Vincent Weir Award = The Vincent Weir scientific award was first presented at the National Bat Conference in 2010, in honour of the late Vincent Weir. The award is presented annually to a student at a UK- based institution who has made a significant contribution to research on the conservation biology of bats. = The Pete Guest award = The Pete Guest award was first presented in 2004, replacing the ‚ÄúOutstanding voluntary contribution to bat conservation‚Äù award set up in 2002. The award is for individuals who have made an outstanding practical contribution to bat conservation, and is also presented to the winner at the National Bat Conference.

In 2007, having recruited Sun-Hwa Kwon, Jack Shephard and Benjamin Linus find a way to return to the island. Jack makes a last-ditch effort to recruit the other \\"Oceanic 6\\" survivors. Plot The episode begins with Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), and Hugo \\"Hurley\\" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) having returned to the island, three years since they left it in \\"There's No Place Like Home\\". The narrative then shifts to 46 hours previous where the previous episode, \\"This Place is Death\\", left off. Eloise Hawking (Fionnula Flanagan) takes Jack, Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick), Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) and Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) to a Dharma Initiative station underneath the church called the Lamp Post, which was used by Dharma to find the island; since the island is constantly moving, they developed a way to predict where it would be at a given time. When Eloise mentions that the group only has 36 hours to get on Ajira Airways Flight 316, a Boeing 737-300, in order to return to the island, Desmond refuses to join them and leaves. Eloise then tells Jack in private that he must bring something that belonged to his father Christian Shephard (John Terry) with him on the flight and also gives him John Locke's (Terry O'Quinn) suicide note. That evening, Jack gets a call informing him that his grandfather Ray (Raymond J. Barry) has attempted to escape his nursing home. The next day, Jack goes to the nursing home and finds an old pair of Christian's shoes and decides to take them with him. Later, Jack returns to his apartment, where he finds Kate waiting for him, in his bed. He asks her where her adoptive son Aaron is, but she refuses to answer. Kate tells Jack that if he wants her to get back to the island, he must never ask her about Aaron. Then they kiss passionately and fall into bed. The next morning, Jack receives a phone call from a severely beaten Ben, who tells Jack that he must go to a butcher shop and retrieve Locke's dead body. Jack does so, putting Christian's shoes on Locke's feet in the process. He also leaves the suicide note in Locke's pocket. At the airport, Jack, Kate, Sun, and Hurley all board Flight 316. Hurley buys up all the remaining seats on the plane, in order to spare the lives of potential passengers. Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) also boards the plane, in the custody of Ilana (Zuleikha Robinson). Ben is last to board the plane, which momentarily disquiets Hurley. Also on board is Caesar (Sa√Ød Taghmaoui). Jack asks Ben as to what will happen to the other people on the plane, to which Ben replies: \\"Who cares?\\", leaving Jack speechless. During the flight, Jack hears the Captain's voice, that Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey) is piloting the plane and Frank realizes that they are going back to the island. Jack, who has been given Locke's note by a flight attendant, reads the note which says, \\"Jack, I wish you had believed me.\\" The 737 hits turbulence and there is a flash of white light similar to that caused by the time shifts. The first scene replays, following which, Jack, Kate and Hurley are found by Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim), who is driving a Dharma van and wearing a Dharma jumpsuit. Production This episode and \\"The Life and Death of Jeremy Bentham\\" were written at the same time by executive producers Lindelof and Cuse. \\"The Life and Death of Jeremy Bentham\\" was originally meant to be aired first, but the order was switched because they felt it made more sense and was \\"cooler\\" and \\"there is probably some good information to get in '316' before.\\" Reception 13.161 million American viewers watched the episode's premiere. IGN's Chris Carabott wrote that Frank's return in the episode was shocking, but seemed as though it was meant to be. He opined that: \\"The chances of Frank being on that plane are astronomical and the fact that he was supposed to be the pilot of Flight 815 just makes the situation all the more unusual. His appearance in this episode is absurd but after four and a half seasons of Lost it makes perfect sense.\\" James Yates of the Staten Island Advance wrote that it was \\"great\\" to see Frank again, as he had missed the character's presence, and hoped he would play a major part upon returning to the island.

Career  Nakamura's first success came in a second place at Grand Prix Kobe in 2001. This qualified him for Pro Tour New Orleans. However, he chose not to attend. In January 2002 he played his first Pro Tour in San Diego. Managing several Top 8 at Japanese Grand Prix, a Top 8 appearance at Pro Tour Columbus in 2005 was his first major showing on the Pro Tour. He followed this finish with another Top 8 at the World Championship the same season. Ultimately, Nakamura would finish fourth in the Player of the Year standings with 66 Pro Points. In 2006 Nakamura achieved several high finishes at Limited events, including third places at PT Prague and GP Toulouse. Eventually he also won his first major tournament, Grand Prix St. Louis 2006, immediately backing up the victory by winning the next Grand Prix event in Hiroshima four weeks later. As both of his Grand Prix wins were in the Coldsnap limited format, Shuhei earned the nickname 'Snowmaster'. Nakamura gained 56 Pro Points throughout the season placing him second in the 2006 Player of the Year Race, only four points behind winner Shouta Yasooka. The 2007 season was not quite as successful for Nakamura, however, he did manage to make his fourth Pro Tour Top 8 appearance at PT Valencia. The 2008 season started off perfect with a victory in the first professional tournament of the season, Grand Prix Stuttgart.

Nakamura was the fourth of five Japanese players to win the Player of the Year title in a row, preceded by Kenji Tsumura, Shouta Yasooka, Tomoharu Saito and followed by Yuuya Watanabe. Nakamura has personally referred to this period as a 'golden age' for Magic in Japan. In 2009 Nakamura finished third at Grand Prix Rotterdam in February, but achieved no further final eight appearances until his victory at the Japanese Nationals in July. On 19 August 2011 it was announced that Nakamura will be inducted into the Magic: The Gathering Hall of Fame along with Steven O'Mahoney-Schwartz and Anton Jonsson.

Gladeville was formerly a regional softball hub in the 1980s and 1990s with many large tournaments being held in the spring and summer months. However, in the early 2000s a significant decrease in activity occurred and by the mid 2000s, activity ceased completely. The softball field has been used for various youth teams since, and is currently utilized by the Diamond Dawgs, which boasts 11U and 12U AAA traveling competitive baseball teams.

Depicting the setting sun through the entryway of Bognemark, H√∏st's farm in Gudhjem, Bornholm - one of his most frequent motifs. The Oluf H√∏st Museum in Gudhjem, Bornholm Oluf H√∏st (18 March 1884 ‚Äì 14 May 1966) was a Danish Expressionist painter, the only member of the Bornholm school who was a native Bornholmer. Although he studied in Copenhagen, he returned to the Danish island of Bornholm in 1929 where he remained with his family for the rest of his life. Bognemark, a little farmhouse near Gudhjem, was one of H√∏st's favourite motifs. From 1935 on, he painted the farm some 200 times under varying conditions at different times of the year, often reflecting his particular mood at the time.Oluf H√∏st from Bornholms Kunstmuseum (in Danish). Retrieved 10 December 2008. His home in Gudhjem, built from two fishermen's cottages with a rocky garden in the rear, is named \\"Norres√¢n\\" after the nearby harbour, N√∏rresand Havn, where he painted many of his works. Life and work H√∏st was born in Svaneke on the island of Bornholm. He attended various schools of art in Copenhagen including the Academy of Fine Arts from 1906 and 1915. During this period, he studied at Harald Giersing's school where Karl Isakson introduced him to Expressionism, especially through the work of C√©zanne and Van Gogh.\\"Oluf H√∏st\\", Kunstindeks Danmark & Wilbachs Kunstnerleksikon. Retrieved 29 October 2012. Inspired above all by C√©zanne, H√∏st's work was also strongly influenced by the Nordic tradition as a result of the changing seasons and weather. This is evident in the way he depicted changes of light and mood. H√∏st commented: > \\"We have our seasons, the long light nights, the enchantment that we must > struggle with, while C√©zanne lived in a place where there was no weather as > such, as it was always the same.\\" In 1913, H√∏st married Hedvig Wiedemann, a fellow student. They had two sons, Ole and Niels. They were sociable hosts, inviting many contemporary intellectuals to their home, including the author Otto Gelsted (1888‚Äì1968) who was a frequent guest. In 1943, Ole, the older of his two sons who had joined the SS, died in Barvinkove (Barwenkowo), a small town on the Eastern Front in Russia. H√∏st felt guilty for the rest of his life about introducing his son to his friend Fritz Waschnitius, an Austrian-born translator and writer who was a Nazi supporter. It was no doubt Waschnitius who had encouraged Ole to fight with the Germans. Over the next few years, H√∏st painted a series of pictures of the Bognemark farm as if it was facing towards Barwenkowo. After H√∏st returned to Bornholm in 1929, he was free to paint as he wished. He concentrated on local buildings and landscapes including views of Gudhjem with its smokehouses (the little smokehouse at the N√∏rresand harbour was a favorite) and dramatic St. Hans midsummer bonfires. But his favorite was Bognemark, at the top of a cliff above Norres√¢n, where he bought a farm in 1935, making it his second studio. From there, he painted many sunsets looking out across the water towards the Swedish coast. There were also picturesque views over Salene Bay where Sweden could be seen on a clear day. As the farmhouse is aligned in an east-west direction, it provided fine sunset vistas from the coach house. It was a frequent haunt for many years. He also painted details of the gables and roofs of the buildings in different shades of the light of the setting sun and in several permutations. There were scenes of the killing of pigs, the cowshed and the haystacks. He liked bright colors. H√∏st is also known for his subtly expressed acerbic views in the 1,800 diaries he called \\"log books\\", written with such clarity and self-criticism. After his death, they were kept in secret by the Royal Library as H√∏st had specified they should not be revealed until 50 years after his death. A typical comment was: \\"I really have nothing to talk about with people who do not like negroes and films, and feel cement is ugly.\\" or \\"I cannot do without the common people ‚Äì nature's loneliness and silent friendship.\\" Based largely on the log books, a recent biography by Jens Henrik Sandberg, director of the Oluf H√∏st Museum, was published in 2012 with the title Oluf H√∏st: jeg blev v√¶k i mig selv (Oluf H√∏st: I was lost in my self), a title H√∏st had chosen for his biography if ever it should be written. His family and friends thought that the term of 50 years on the log books may have been set because they contained information about links with the Nazis but this proved not to be the case. In fact, one of Oluf Host's paintings was labeled by the Nazis as \\"degenerate art\\" and removed from an art exhibition in Berlin (along with a painting by Van Gogh). Oluf claimed he was apolitical. On one occasion he confided that while he had voted conservative, he was in fact more sympathetic to the communists. Sandberg, qualifying him as a Metaphysical painter, comments that his early works were reflective of his association with the so-called \\"dark painters\\" but in later life they were of a lighter and more intellectual style. Honours From 1930, H√∏st was recognized as a Danish artist of great repute. He received a number of honours, including the Eckersberg Medal (1933), Denmark's highest award for painting, and the Thorvaldsen Medal (1943), the prestigious visual arts award.Oluf H√∏st Museum Retrieved 10 December 2008.\\"Oluf H√∏st\\", Den Store Danske. Retrieved 29 October 2012. In 1957 he was awarded the Prince Eugen Medal. He also exhibited with success at Den Frie Udstilling (The Free Exhibition) from 1926. However, he was so attached to his paintings that he did not want to lose them and therefore did not exhibit for years on end. He was so fastidious about his paintings that even after their sale to private individuals or museums he would return with brushes and paints to touch them up, frequently reclaiming them for \\"completion\\".

Every year, ARSP sends approximately 180 volunteers to countries that suffered under the German occupation during World War II: Belgium, France, the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Russia, Poland, Czech Republic, Belarus, and the Ukraine. They also work in Israel and the United States because many Holocaust survivors fled or immigrated to these countries.Description of ARSP Illinois Holocaust Museum official website. Retrieved March 10, 2010  Objective  Excerpt from the by-laws of ARSP ¬ß2 Purpose and operation :1. The organization is one whose goal, in taking up and furthering the Founding Manifesto of 1958, is reconciliation with those nations and peoples occupied by Nazi Germany or threatened with annihilation; and to develop the aptitude for peace. :2. It shall realize its tasks in particular through: ::a) short- and long-term voluntary service; ::b) seminars and other educational resources; ::c) promotion of scientific research whose purpose has themes of peace and reconciliation; ::d) help for victims of tyranny; ::e) promoting cooperation among all who are pursuing the same goals; ::f) informing the public about the objectives pursued by the organization. History of the Action Reconciliation Service for Peace = Background = The beginnings of ARSP started with the actions of the Evangelical Church in Germany to reject Nazism and resist the Nazi regime. The founder of ARSP, Lothar Kreyssig, was one of the determined resisters within the Confessing Church. After the war, he made this refusal by the Protestant church a subject of discussion and, along with like-minded people, such as Martin Niem√∂ller, Gustav Heinemann and later, Franz von Hammerstein, called for repentance and reversal. = Appeal for the Action for Reconciliation = Lothar Kreyssig tried to find fellow campaigners for his reconciliation service for the first time on Kirchentag 1954, in Leipzig. The appeal found few ears. \\"That something is right and necessary, is not enough to see it materialize in time and space. The hour must be ripe,\\" he later wrote in his unpublished autobiography. The Synod of the Evangelical Church in Germany convened from 26 to 30 April 1958, alternating in Spandau, in West Berlin) and Wei√üensee in East Berlin. At this point, the synod still involved the entire Evangelical Church in Germany, both east and west. There was a controversy that year over the west German military chaplaincy contract and possible nuclear armament by the Bundeswehr. This was the troubled atmosphere in which Praeses Kreyssig, on the last day of the Synod, read his appeal to found the Action for Reconciliation. Numerous attendees signed the appeal that evening. The appeal not only expressed an admission of guilt, it also delineated concrete consequences. The Action for Reconciliation would not offer assistance, rather, would ask to help. This humble attitude was a rejection of any patronizing functionalization of the reconciliation thought process. The attitude was to signal the readiness to get involved ‚Äî that is, to learn by doing and through dialogue ‚Äî because the appeal relied on conversation, response and new action.Appeal by Lothar Kreyssig English translation of Kreyssig's 1958 appeal for German atonement for Nazi crimes. Retrieved March 12, 2010 The Action for Reconciliation was initially founded as a Germany-wide organization, but the division of Germany made a joint effort impossible. The two German states therefore had two organizations with a common goal, albeit different emphasis in practice. = ARSP in western Germany = The western German ARSP began its work in 1959 with construction projects in the Netherlands and Norway and later, with projects in other countries. Volunteers helped build a synagoge in Villeurbanne and the Church of Reconciliation in Taiz√©, Sa√¥ne-et-Loire, in Burgundy, France. They helped build a kindergarten in Skopje in the former Yugoslavia, helped install a water irrigation system on Crete, and helped create an international symbol of reconciliation from the ruins of Coventry Cathedral in England. Work in Israel began in 1961, after the Adolph Eichmann trial was concluded. From the mid-1960s, the projects slowly changed. There was ever less construction work, but new projects emerged for memorials, for work with the elderly, and social work. By the 1980s, with World War II fading into the past, there were additional projects working with minority groups. = ASZ in eastern Germany = After 1961, the Berlin Wall prevented the East German Action for Reconciliation (Aktion S√ºhnezeichen, or ASZ) from sending any more volunteers to the west. Because the German Democratic Republic (GDR) considered itself to be an anti-fascist state, it did not consider itself responsible for the consequences of German fascism. Therefore, the projects of the ASZ were initially limited to the GDR. In 1965 and 1966, volunteers were still able to travel with Catholic chaplains from Magdeburg to Auschwitz, Majdanek, Stutthof, Gro√ü-Rosen and Breslau. By 1967 and 1968, further trips to memorial sites in Poland and Czechoslovakia were not permitted, despite invitations being sent to the state visa refusal. With the introduction in 1972 of visa- free travel between the GDR and Poland and Czechoslovakia, young German were able to take part in summer camps in Poland. By then, Polish and Czech young people were also embarking on missions in the GDR. From this time on, reconciliation groups were involved in the preservation and restoration of Jewish cemeteries in almost every region of the GDR. The first group to work at Buchenwald was in 1979. Starting in 1981, the number of summer camps expanded to include Sachsenhausen, Ravensbr√ºck, and Nordhausen-Dora. From 1962 till 1992, over 12,000 volunteers took part in the summer camps from ASZ. = Reunification = After reunification, the two eastern and western organizations merged, retaining their different forms of voluntary service, the long-term service of the ARSP and the short-term service and summer camps of the ASZ. Like the European Voluntary Service, since the late 1990s, the ARSP has increased the number of project sites to respond to changing need and new opportunities.  Current ARSP projects  = Long-term voluntary service = At present, ARSP sends out about 180 men and women per year to work on projects, primarily in countries that suffered directly from the Nazis, but also ones that have large numbers of Holocaust survivors. Belgium, France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Russia, the Czech Republic, Israel, Ukraine, America and Belarus all have ARSP voluntary projects. The volunteers are predominantly young, between the ages of 18 and 27. Conscientious objectors can fulfill their required civil service under the auspices of ARSP. Volunteers support and accompany survivors of the Holocaust and their descendants, work at memorial sites, take care of older people, those with disabilities, the disadvantaged and refugees, and get involved in neighborhood projects and anti-racism initiatives. ARSP volunteers helped create an international center of reconciliation in the ruins of Coventry Cathedral. In Israel, volunteers have worked in historical or political education and at the national memorial site, Yad Vashem in Jerusalem and in projects with Jewish and Arab citizens, working toward mutual understanding. ARSP first sent volunteers to Norway and the Netherlands in 1959 to work on construction projects. More recently, volunteers in the Netherlands work in historical or political education, for example, at the Joods Historisch Museum or Anne Frank Foundation. Volunteers in Poland work in societies for former concentration camp prisoners and at concentration camps sites, Auschwitz in O≈õwiƒôcim, Stutthof in Gda≈Ñsk and Majdanek near Lublin. For political reasons, ARSP first sent volunteers to Russia in 1990, and the Czech Republic in 1993. In Russia, they work at veterans' hospitals and the Russian human rights organization, Memorial. In the Czech Republic, they work with the Jewish community in Prague and at the memorial site Theresienstadt concentration camp. Volunteers to Ukraine work with former forced laborers. ARSP has 24 volunteer positions in the United States. They work with Holocaust survivors or in offices at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Washington, DC and the American Jewish Committee in New York and Washington.Ruth Rovner (February/March 1998). \\"Emissaries of Good Will ‚Äî Young Germans Participate in a Unique Project\\" , German Life. Retrieved March 15, 2010. Since 1996, about 15-20 requests per year have come from partner programs in other countries from young people seeking voluntary peace service in Germany, as well. = Short- and medium-term voluntary service = Each year, about 300 people take part in summer camps, where they live and work together in about 25 camps in Germany and other countries. All summer camps are run by unsalaried employees, often former long-term volunteers who want to pass along their own experience. During the two- to three-week stay, volunteers learn about current and historical issues and are involved in projects, such as performing upkeep at Jewish cemeteries and memorial sites. They also work in social services and with intercultural projects. For the past several years, there has been medium-term voluntary service available in Israel. Lasting three to six months, this service involves volunteers of all ages, including seniors. There is a three-day orientation seminar is held in the country.  Public relations and education  Many ARSP alumni are in regional groups and maintain connections, continuing to volunteer even after their initial voluntary period ends. With the implementation of long- and short-term voluntary service, more unsalaried positions are created, filled by these alumni. Some also contribute to public relations and education efforts. Four times a year, ARSP publishes Zeichen (Signs), a magazine (in German) that reports on the current work of volunteers and project partners. Each issue is centered around a different theme. It publishes Predigthilfen & Materiellen f√ºr die Gemeinde (Sermon aids and materials for the congregation) three times a year, on the occasion of \\"Israel Sunday,\\" (a memorial day in the Evangelical church); for a ten-day period in November, called the √ñkumenische Friedensdekade (\\"Ecumenical Decade of Peace\\"); and for International Holocaust Remembrance Day. With these, ARSP wants to convey theological insights from the Jewish-Christian dialogue and the dialogue with Islam into the religious community. In addition, ARSP wants to weigh in on current political themes, thereby joining the inter-religious and inter-cultural dialogue and presenting its position against anti-semitism, right-wing extremism and racism and strongly advocating for compensation to those persecuted by the Nazis; and for a just peace. = Educational work = ARSP endeavors to stimulate societal debateon the themes of the politics of memory, national identities and inter-religious dialogue with events, workshops, seminars and congresses.

He and his wife Taqulittuq were the best-known and most widely-travelled Inuit in the 1860s and 1870s.  Biography  = Life in England = The nickname \\"Joe\\" was given him by the whalers of Cumberland Sound. In 1852, one of these whalers, Thomas Bowlby, Bolby, or Bowling, took Joe and his partner Taqulittuq, known as \\"Hannah,\\" and another young Inuk with him to the English whaling port of Hull. He exhibited them at several venues and always took care to let the curious know that Joe and Hannah were married and had converted to Christianity. Bowlby made arrangements for them to be received by Queen Victoria, and they apparently made a very favorable impression. Unlike many less scrupulous men, Bowlby returned all three Inuit to the Arctic safe and well. = Charles Francis Hall = Ipirvik at an exposition In 1860, Ipirvik and Taqulittuq met Charles Francis Hall, and worked closely with him as he sought to trace Inuit oral traditions about the 16th-century expedition of Martin Frobisher. Taqulittuq worked principally as Hall's translator, while Ipirvik served as guide and hunter. Having located the original site of Frobisher's attempted settlement, Hall returned to the United States in 1862, bringing Ipirvik, Taqulittuq and their infant son Tukerliktu along with him. Hall had the Inuit family appear with him when he gave his talk on the Frobisher relics at the American Geographical Society, and aware of the high degree of interest in them, arranged with P. T. Barnum for their exhibition at Barnum's American Museum. Hall arranged for their exhibition shortly afterwards at the Boston Aquarial Gardens, but when no payment was forthcoming for this second exhibit, swore off any more dealings with \\"Show Establishments.\\" Nevertheless, Ipirvik and Taqulittuq, along with little Tukerliktu, appeared with Hall during his east coast lecture tour of 1863; the strain of the tour led to health problems for both \\"Hannah\\" and her son, and a few weeks later \\"Butterfly\\" was dead. He and Taqulittuq accompanied Hall on his final voyage, the Polaris expedition, in search of the North Pole. After Hall's death, he was among the party left behind, when the ship broke loose of the ice and failed to return. During the party's six-month drift on a gradually-shrinking icefloe, Ipirvik and Hans Hendrik managed to provide food for the entire party; they were eventually picked up by a sealer in April 1873. During the investigation into Hall's death, both Ipirvik and Taqulittuq supported Hall's claim that he had been poisoned, but their evidence was discounted. = Later life = The couple returned to Groton, Connecticut, although Ipirvik returned to the Arctic periodically to work as a guide, while Taqulittuq remained behind, cared for their daughter Panik\\"Panik\\" is Inuit for daughter.

It is the oldest existing Chinese school in Tacloban City. It is colloquially known as Heng-hwa by the local Chinese Filipino community. History In 1919, the Leyte Chinese School was established by a group of local Chinese businessmen through the Leyte Tek Club and the Tacloban Filipino-Chinese Chamber of Commerce. The Leyte Chinese School started in an old building with two rooms and with an enrolment of a few boys and girls who were mostly from the Leyte Chinese Community. The school was registered with the Department of Education in 1921. Eight years after its establishment, the first school building was erected. Three years after, the first newly built Chinese School in Leyte was closed for a year due to financial problems. The school's closure alarmed the Chinese community; hence, an education committee was organized with the objective of reopening the school in line with its vision that education of the Chinese children should be given concerted and preferential attention by the Chinese community. As expected, the student population increased and the school was transferred to a building at Grand Capitan street (now Justice Romualdez Street). The school was forced to close when war broke out in 1941 and was reopened after the liberation in October 1945. The Chinese community immediately worked on the renovation of the school buildings and other facilities which had been destroyed by the war. A new school building was constructed at Sabang District. Thus, the first graduation ceremony for the High School department was held in the new building. At this point, the name was changed from Leyte Chinese School to Leyte Chinese High School. However, in 1973, a government circular required all Chinese schools to Filipinize their names so that it had to be renamed Leyte Progressive High School.

He was a master tradesman under the patronage of the Dauphin of France. Vandive's premises was on the rue Saint-Jacques, Paris. His trade mark was the \\"Crowned Dolphin\\". Vandive published books in French and Latin on the topics of Jansenist theology, trade and travel. After his death at age 26, Vandive's business was continued by Nicolas Simart who married Vandive's widow. Family discord and legal actions ensued. Personal history Vandive, was born into the Vandive family about 1680 and was baptized in the Church of St. Bartholomew, Paris, as \\"Vandivout\\" or \\"Van Dievoet\\". He was the eldest son of a Parisian goldsmith, Philippe Van Dievoet (1654 1738) from Brussels, who traded as \\"Vandive\\". Vandive senior was a Counsellor to the King, and a Goldsmith to the King and the Dauphin. Vandive senior was the nephew of the sculptor Peter Van Dievoet (1661 1729) of Brussels. In 1705, in Paris, Vandive married El√©onore Le Prieur. They had a daughter, Charlotte-El√©onore. Guillaume Vandive died in 1706 at age 26. After his death, on 15 June 1706, El√©onore married the printer, Nicolas Simart. Education From April 1697 to April 1701, Vandive was apprenticed to Jean Boudot (about 1651 1706), ordinary printer to the King and the Royal Academy of Sciences, and director of the printing works of Louis Auguste, Prince of Dombes of Tr√©voux. On 20 December 1701, Vandive was accepted as a Master under the recommendation of Monseigneur the Grand Dauphin Louis (addressed as \\"Monseigneur\\", as specified by Lottin). Production Vandive worked on the rue Saint-Jacques opposite the rue de la Parcheminerie. In 1701, 1704 and 1706, Vandive produced catalogues describing the books he had printed at his business. He also documented other books he had published in France or abroad. Vandive's typographical mark, made in homage to the Dauphin, consisted of three surmounted dolphins swimming over a fleur-de-lis styled closed crown. There are two cornucopia with a listel at the top. The listel contains the motto, \\"hoc duce tuta salus\\" (literally, \\"under his own safety\\" but in the spirit of \\"with this dolphin as guide, your safety is assured\\") inspired by the legend of the poet, Arion. Coignard Vandive published a series of works in collaboration with Louis Coignard (1680 27 September 1738). Coignard worked on the rue Saint-Jacques under the \\"Gold Eagle\\" mark. On 28 December 1737, Coignard was imprisoned at the Bastille on a charge of publishing Jansenist works. He was transferred to the convent of Meung-sur-Loire where he died a few months later. Coignard was the brother of Elie Jean-Baptiste Coignart (1667 1735) who published the first edition of Le Dictionnaire de l'Acad√©mie fran√ßoise dedi√© au Roy in 1694. He was the son of Jean-Baptiste Ier Coignart (1637 10 September 1686) printer-bookseller of the King and the French Academy. In 1703, a catalog of the books that Vandive published in collaboration with Coignard was produced. An example of one of the books catalogued is Jean-Pierre Camus' L'Aviosinement des protestants vers l'Eglise romaine. It was a newly corrected edition with an editorial supplement by the Oratorian, Richard Simon (1638 1712). Published works Vandive published recent and new books in French and sometimes in Latin. The books had various subjects but in particular, were about Jansenist theology, trade and travel. Vandive's catalogues also contain books intended for \\"new converts\\". For example, he published Instructions g√©n√©rales en forme de cat√©chisme by Charles-Joachim Colbert de Croissy, Bishop of Montpellier. Another example is Histoire abr√©g√©e de la Conversion de Monsieur Chanteau by Nicolas Feuillet. Vandive also published the works of Henry de Barillon, Jean- Pierre Camus, Vincent Houdry, and Etienne Lochon. Le Parfait N√©gociant by Jacques Savary was presented as a new edition, Trait√© des Lettres de Change. The special books section of the Royal Library of Brussels, has preserved one of Vandive's publications, Voyage du Sieur Paul Lucas au Levant. It is a work in two volumes dated 1704. It is bound in red morocco leather. The plates bear the arms of Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. In 1699, Paul Lucas was sent as the antiquaire du Roi (antique dealer of the King), to the Levant and the East. His task was to collect objects for Louis XIV. According to Dirk Van der Cruysse, his books, published by Vandive, are among the most coloured journals of the period. Nicolas Simart Vandive's successor was Nicolas Simart. Simart married Vandive's widow and continued the business at the same address and under the same trade mark as a \\"printer and ordinary bookseller of Monseigneur the Dauphin\\". In 1727, Simart sued Philippe Vandive and Balthazar Philippe Vandive for the expense of the maintenance and education of his step daughter, Charlotte El√©onore. Simart published an account of the indictment of the Vandive family. This indictment is preserved at the National Library of Paris. In 1731, Simart published a \\"new re-examined and corrected edition\\" of the Voyage du Sieur Paul Lucas au Levant. However, it was an exact reproduction of Vandive's first edition. In 1748, Simart was imprisoned for debts at the Caretaker's Lodge prison of Paris. According to the inspector, H√©mery in his \\"Historique of Booksellers\\", Simart remained in prison on 1 January 1749.

It lay on a branch line from Sandbach to Northwich. The Mid Cheshire Rail Users' Association is campaigning for the reopening of the line to passenger traffic, and the construction of a new station at Middlewich. The station stood on the branch line that was primarily built to serve the industries between Sandbach and Northwich. Most revenue came from the Cheshire salt mines before its transport switched to road haulage. Chemical factories also used the branch with sidings serving the bigger factories. Middlewich station had a sizeable goods depot for freight and parcels office for public use. With the withdrawal of passenger services, the Middlewich branch continues to be used by freight trains and for occasional train diversions. History =Passengers= The branch line and Middlewich station were built by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) during 1867-1868. The railway line was completed in November 1867 and was initially used by goods trains. The station was completed later and was opened for passenger use on 1 July 1868. It would be operated by the London Midland & Scottish Railway (LMSR) after the railway grouping of 1 January 1923. Passengers services operated between Crewe via to Middlewich and . Some trains reversed at Northwich and then continued to Hartford and Greenbank and then along a short stretch of the West Coast Main Line (WCML) to Acton Bridge. In 1885, the LNWR initiated a through carriage on weekdays from Manchester Oxford Road via Northwich to Middlewich and on to London Euston. For example in July 1922 there were nine trains a day to Crewe to Northwich, of which five continued to Acton Bridge. There was an additional morning train from and to Crewe that reversed at Middlewich. A departing service from Manchester at 10:30 would pick passengers up at major stations to Northwich, calling at Middlewich at 11:30. The carriage reached Crewe at 11:50, where the steam loco detached and the carriage was attached to a Liverpool to Euston express, reaching the capital at 15:10. The northbound service left Euston at 14:30, reaching Middlewich at 18:10. The services to Euston had ceased by World War II. By August 1946, the local passenger service had been reduced to six trains each way between Crewe, Middlewich and Northwich, each offering only third class accommodation. The LMSR was nationalised by British Railways on 1 January 1948 and the branch was thereafter operated by the London Midland Region =Halts= As the branch was in length, with just one main station at Middlewich, the LNWR decided to construct two railway halts to improve facilities for passengers in the locality. Cledford Bridge Halt was located between Sandbach and Middlewich and opened in January 1911. Billinge Green Halt was located between Middlewich and Northwich and opened during 1915. Both halts were closed by the LMSR on 2 March 1942. =Closure= Middlewich station shared in the common experience of a drastic reduction of services during the war and for years after. By January 1956, the passenger service offered just four third-class only trains each way on weekdays, and none on Sundays. Unlike many other lines services were not increased after 1956. The station became victim of the pre Beeching cuts closure programme, with regular passenger trains ceasing to use the branch on 4 January 1960. The station buildings were subsequently demolished. The nearest railway station is now Winsford 2.3 miles (3.7 km) away on the WCML. Current status Freight services regularly use the line through Middlewich to get from the West Coast Main Line at Sandbach (and nearby Crewe) to the Mid-Cheshire line at Northwich. The Crewe and Chester Line is known to flood during severe weather. When this happens, or during engineering work, the line is closed and some Avanti West Coast services from London to Chester and North Wales are diverted through Middlewich instead (Transport for Wales services are replaced by buses and do not use the line). As the section where Middlewich railway station used to be remains dual-track on the otherwise single-track line, diverted Avanti West Coast services are timed for one service to wait at the station's location while another passes or may instead run via Warrington. Due to the line's low speed, travelling from Crewe to Chester via Middlewich takes approximately 1 hour compared to 20 minutes using the Crewe and Chester Line. As the Crewe and Chester Line is currently Tier 2 priority for being electrified in the CP6 period (2019-2024), it would be likely that Avanti West Coast would introduce electric trains to Chester or further to North Wales if the North Wales Coast Line was also electrified. As part of this, electrifying the Northwich to Sandbach line has been mentioned to allow for the aforementioned diversions to take place without needing diesel locomotives to drag the electric units. The Mid Cheshire Rail Users' Association is presently campaigning for the reintroduction of passenger services on the Sandbach - Northwich line and the construction of a new station at Middlewich, though not necessarily in the same location as the original. The campaign received a boost in July 2018 when it was announced that the government had requested a strategic outline business plan into the reopening of the line to passenger traffic. The business case is to be handled by Cheshire East Council in conjunction with Cheshire West and Chester Council and the Cheshire and Warrington Local Enterprise Partnership and will look into the cost and benefits of reopening the line and the building of new stations at Middlewich and Gadbrook Park.

Along with his brother, Stanley Robison, he was also co-owner of the St. Louis Perfectos/Cardinals baseball team of the National League from through . After briefly attending Delaware University, Robison went into business with his father-in-law, Charles Hathaway, operating streetcars in Cleveland, Ohio. In 1887, he used funds from this business to start up a baseball team, the Cleveland Blues (called the Forest Citys in some sources). He continued to operate in both areas for the next two decades, including financing the construction of League Park in 1889, and the formation of the Cleveland City Railway Company in 1893. In 1899, the Robison brothers were responsible for the worst Major League Baseball team in history, the 1899 Cleveland Spiders. Before the season, the Robisons purchased the bankrupt St. Louis Browns from Chris von der Ahe and renamed them the Perfectos. During the single season in which they owned both the Spiders and Perfectos, the brothers transferred the best players of both franchises to St. Louis, leaving the Spiders with a team that finished with a record of 20-134, the worst full-season record ever for a major league baseball team. Following this debacle (and a similar one involving the Baltimore Orioles and Brooklyn Superbas), the practice of allowing the same owners to run multiple teams was outlawed. Following Robison's death in 1908, Stanley Robison became sole owner of the Cardinals until his death at his home in Bratenahl, Ohio in 1911, when the franchise was bequeathed to Frank's daughter (and Stanley's niece) Helene Hathaway Britton.

History The abbey was founded in 1143 by Hasculf de Subligny, son of Othoerne, the tutor of William Adelin, both of whom perished in the White Ship disaster of 1120, and later had the support of the English crown. The new monastery was settled from Dommartin Abbey near Hesdin. The foundation stone of the permanent buildings was laid in 1164 by Achard of St. Victor, who was later buried here. Construction lasted from 1164 to 1178 and was in the Romanesque style, in the restrained and sober manner of Cistercian architecture, except that the complex was dominated by an Anglo- Norman Gothic tower. La Lucerne was the mother-house of four other Premonstratensian monasteries: Ardenne Abbey, Mondaye Abbey and Belle-√âtoile Abbey (at Cerisy-Belle-√âtoile) in Normandy, and Beauport Abbey in Brittany. Major structural renovations were carried out in the 15th and 17th centuries. During the French Revolution, in 1792, the abbey was suppressed. Its buildings were at first turned into a cotton mill and then used as a source of stone. Reconstruction La Lucerne Abbey The ruins were classed as a monument historique in 1928. In 1959, under the aegis of Abb√© Marcel Lel√©gard (1925-94), the enormous task was begun, which still continues under the \\"Fondation Abbaye de La Lucerne d'Outremer\\", of the restoration of the abbey. The first phase of the work was the reconstruction of the abbey church, particularly the ogival crossing vaults and the west front with its Romanesque portal, continuing to the refectory and cellars. Work has continued since then and the tithe barn, the Romanesque lavatorium (the only one in Normandy), the medieval gatehouse (with its bakery and courtrooms), the dovecote, the park, the 18th century abbot's lodgings and the ponds are all now restored . The chapel of Blessed Achard is in the process of restoration. One of the aims of the \\"Fondation Abbaye de La Lucerne d'Outremer\\" has been to re-establish a monastic community at La Lucerne, and the abbey is still being rebuilt with that intention.

In 1963, the South African police raided the farm, arresting more than a dozen ANC leaders and activists, who were then tried and prosecuted during the Rivonia Trial. Since the end of apartheid, the area has been turned into a museum and heritage site. History The farmhouse is located in Rivonia, a suburb outside Johannesburg. In 1961, the property was purchased by Arthur Goldreich and Harold Wolpe to use as the headquarters for the underground South African Communist Party and a safe house for political fugitives. African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela needed a safe place from which to operate, and lived there under the assumed name of David Motsamayi, a farmer hired to work on the farm. On 11 July 1963, security police raided the farm and arrested 19 members of the underground, later charging and prosecuting a number of them with sabotage. The police had learned of the location from two sources: George Mellis, who lived nearby in the Rivonia Caravan Park, noticed a number of cars going in and out of the farm area and told his family; and a police informant in the uMkhonto we Sizwe, the ANC's armed wing. The activists had been meeting in the thatched room and were surprised by the raid. They had already decided beforehand to move to another safe house, with 11 July being their last meeting at Liliesleaf. Nelson Mandela was already in prison, serving a sentence of five years for leaving the country illegally, having been arrested the previous year. The police found documents during the raid that had been hidden in a coal bunker incriminating Mandela. As a result, he was charged and brought to trial with the others. The trial, which ran from October 1963 to June 1964, ended with Mandela and seven others found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment.  After apartheid  The farmhouse at Liliesleaf Farm has now been surrounded by the gradual spread of Johannesburg's suburbs, but the historic site has been reopened to visitors. The buildings have been restored to their earlier condition, and visual and audio-visual displays recreate the dramatic events leading up to the police raid, and the raid itself. The farm is referred to either as \\"Liliesleaf\\" or \\"Lilliesleaf\\", with the former spelling used at the site itself.

History =Origins - legend or history?= In the 11th century Lord Isaac (Seigneur Isaac) set out on Crusade and was taken prisoner by the Saracens, but was miraculously freed following a vision of the Virgin Mary. On returning to his lands he built a wooden chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Grace and Consolation, with a statue venerated for nearly two centuries. In 1336 the neighbouring village of Ittre, suffering the Black Death, won permission from the bishop of Cambrai (whose diocese included Brabant) to carry the statue in procession through their village. It was found that the plague abated wherever the statue passed and so the villagers refused to hand back the statue which had protected them so well, finally winning the bishop's agreement to keep it and place a new statue in the chapel of Bois- Seigneur-Isaac. =Augustinian abbey= Better documented is the eucharistic miracle which occurred here on 5 June 1405. On that day, whilst celebrating mass, the parish priest of Ittre found a fragment of the consecrated host in the corporal, which, when he took it in his hands, began to bleed. The bishop of Cambrai investigated the miracle and in 1410 declared it genuine and allowed the chapel to become a place of pilgrimage. Augustinian canons were summoned to the site in 1413 to attend to the spiritual needs of the growing number of pilgrims and the priory the canons established soon became autonomous, becoming an independent abbey in 1416 as the abbey of Bois- Seigneur-Isaac (Abbatia Silvae Domini-Isaac), a member of the reformist Congregation of Windesheim. The small Gothic chapel built over the site of the miracle, which is still the priory church, is the oldest building of the complex and is surmounted by an elegant bell tower. The year 1593 on a keystone shows that it was built in phases, with nearly 200 years between the start and completion of the works. It has a 16th-century ceiling, decorated stalls, paintings of the miracle (by J. Crockaert, 1777), a double-naved sacristy, a polychrome statue of the Virgin and Child, a reliquary and a monstrance. The French Wars of Religion saw the abbey ravaged by the troops of William the Silent in 1580 and the canons forced to flee. Once it was possible to return they did so and rebuilt the abbey, continuing to serve pilgrims until the end of the 18th century. During the French Revolution, Bois- Seigneur-Isaac and all other religious houses were suppressed by the law of 15 Fructidor (1795), and the monks expelled the following year. The local population intervened and although the cloister was demolished and part of the buildings turned into a farm, the chapel survived and was served by a chaplain throughout the 19th century. =Premonstratensian abbey= When the Republican law of 1903 expelled all monks from France, the canons from Mondaye Abbey lived in exile at Bois-Seigneur-Isaac, buying and rebuilding the abbey ruins, turning the chapel into the monastery's church, and renewing and promoting the local devotion to the Holy Blood. The abbey again became an important pilgrimage and spiritual centre. In 1921 the canons were allowed to return to Mondaye and handed over Bois-Seigneur-Isaac to their co-brothers of Averbode Abbey, who ensured the continuity of monastic life and pastoral services there. In 1957 Bois-Seigneur-Isaac officially became a priory dependent on Averbode. The number of pilgrims has dropped dramatically, but the devotion remains active via a Fraternity of the Holy Blood set up in 1900. On major festivals, the Wednesday before Pentecost (the anniversary of the miracle), 1 July (feast of the Holy Blood) and the first Sunday after 8 September (Birth of Our Lady), major celebrations are held, with a procession of the sacrament along the village streets. =Lebanese Maronite Monastery= When the Lebanese Maronite Order arrived in 2010, the monks brought with them relics of Saint Charbel. The devotion for the Holy Blood remains and it‚Äôs now accompanied by that of Saint Charbel. The number of pilgrims is growing especially from the Oriental Churches.

Life and work =Early life= Growing up in New York, Feuerman was deterred from being an artist. She attended the School of Visual Arts in New York City to begin her career as an illustrator. Before her notable success, she went by Carole Jean, illustrating for The New York Times and created album covers for Alice Cooper and the Rolling Stones. During the 1970s she started experimenting with different types of media. Feuerman was hired by National Lampoon and created the sculpture ‚ÄúNose to the Grindstone‚Äù that was used as the cover art of the November 1975 issue. = Public works = In 1981, Feuerman was chosen by a jury at the Heckscher Museum in Long Island where she proceeded to exhibit her works at Fordham University and eventually was also chosen to participate in the Learning through Arts Program conducted by the Guggenheim Museum. At the Learning through Arts Program she was amongst renowned artists such as Romare Bearden, Christo, Keith Haring, Paloma Picasso and Robert Rauschenberg. In 1989, Feuerman began to work her first big marketing campaign with Absolut Vodka. Since Sweden did not allow the advertising of alcohol, Absolut Vodka's marketing plan was to push advertising in other areas of the world. Feuerman created life-sized figures within a glass display which were paraded in trucks on the streets of Los Angeles and Manhattan. In 2008, Feuerman was commissioned by artist Seward Johnson and the Sculpture Foundation to create a one-of-a-kind painted bronze sculpture installation for the permanent collection of Grounds for Sculpture. In May 2012, Feuerman unveiled her monumental sculpture Survival of Serena in painted bronze with New York City's Department of Parks and Recreation. Its resin sister debuted at the Venice Biennale in 2007. The new Survival of Serena is the first of a series of painted bronze sculptures by the artist designed specifically for outdoor placement. The bronze sculpture was installed in Petrosino Square through September before traveling to the Boca Raton Beach Resort in Florida. In 2012, Feuerman's Quan, a painted bronze sculpture of a woman balancing atop a ball of polished stainless steel, was featured at the Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park in Grand Rapids, Michigan as part of the group show Body Double: The Figure in Contemporary Sculpture.

The second phase of Anglo- Hindu law started in 1864, and ended in 1947, during which a written legal code was adopted, and the Hindu Pandits along with Muslim Qadis were dismissed due to growing inconsistencies in interpretation of texts and suspicions of corruption. Anglo-Hindu law was expanded with a series of British parliament Acts between 1828 and 1947, that was based on political consensus rather than religious texts.Rosane Rocher, \\"The creation of Anglo-Hindu law\\" in , History In 18th century, the British East India Company, which started out as an agent of the Mughal emperor, soon took over the political and administrative powers in India, it was faced with various state responsibilities such as legislative and judiciary functions.Donald R. Davis, Jr., \\"A historical overview of Hindu law\\" in , The administration pursued a path of least resistance, relying upon co-opted local intermediaries that were mostly Muslims and some Hindus in various princely states. The British exercised power by avoiding interference and adapting to law practices as explained by the local intermediaries. The colonial state thus sustained what were essentially pre-colonial religious and political laws for resolving conflicts, well into the late nineteenth century. For Muslims of India, the code of Muslim law was readily available in al-Hidaya and Fatawa-i Alamgiri written under the sponsorship of Aurangzeb. For Hindus and other non-Muslims, this information was unavailable. The British colonial officials, for practice, attempted to extract from the Dharma≈õƒÅstra, the English categories of law and religion for the purposes of colonial administration. also in Malik Ram Felicitation Volume. ed. S.A.J. Zaidi (New Delhi, 1972), 190‚Äì1.J. D. M. Derrett, Religion, Law, and the State in India (London: Faber, 1968), 96; For a related distinction between religious and secular law in Dharma≈õƒÅstra, see The early period of Anglo-Hindu Law (1772‚Äì1828) was structured along the lines of Muslim law practice. It included the extracted portions of law from one Dharma≈õƒÅstra by British-appointed scholars (especially Sir William Jones, Henry Thomas Colebrooke, Sutherland, and Borrodaile) in a manner similar to Islamic al-Hidaya and Fatawa-i Alamgiri.Michael Anderson in K Ewing (1988), Sharia and ambiguity in South Asian Islam, University of California Press, A digest of Moohummudan law on the subjects to which it is usually applied by British courts of justice in India Neil Baillie, Smith, Elder & Co. London It also included the use of court pandits in British courts to aid the British judges in interpreting Shastras just like Qadis (Maulavis) for interpreting the Islamic law. The arrival of William Bentinck as the Governor-General of British India in 1828, marked a shift towards universal civil code, whose administration emphasized preference for the same law for all human beings, individualism and equal treatment to help liberate, empower and end social practices among Hindus and Muslims of India that had received much public coverage in Britain through the publications of Christian missionaries and individuals such as Thomas Macaulay. Governor-General Dalhousie, in 1848, extended this trend and stated his policy that the law must \\"treat all natives much the same manner\\". Over time, between 1828-1855, a series of British parliamentary acts were passed to revise the Anglo-Hindu and Anglo-Muslim laws, such as those relating to the right to religious conversion, widow remarriage, and right to create wills for inheritance. In 1832, the British colonial government abolished accepting religious fatwa as a source of law. In 1835, the British began creating a criminal code that would replace the existing criminal code which was a complex conflicting mixture of laws derived from Muslim texts (Quran) and Hindu texts (Shastras), and this common criminal code was ready by 1855. These changes were welcomed by Hindu law reform movement, but considered abrogating religion-defined rules within the Muslim law. The changes triggered discontent, call for jihad and religious war, and became partly responsible for the 1857 Indian revolt against the British rule. In 1864, after the East India Company was dissolved and India became a formal part of the British Empire, Anglo-Hindu law entered into a second phase (1864‚Äì1947), one in which British colonial courts in India relied less on the Muslim Qadis and Hindu Pandits for determining the respective religious laws, and relied more on a written law. A universal criminal code for India was adopted in 1864, the expanded to include procedural and commercial code by 1882, which overruled pre-existing Anglo-Hindu and Anglo-Muslim laws.AK Giri in However, the personal laws for Muslims remained sharia-based, while the Anglo-Hindu law was enacted independent of any text on matters such as marriage, divorce, inheritance and the Anglo-Hindu law covered all Hindus, Jains, Sikhs and Buddhists in India.Kunal Parker in In 1872, the British crown enacted the Indian Christian Marriage Act which covered marriage, divorce and alimony laws for Indian Christians of all denominations except the Roman Catholics. The development of legal pluralism, that is separate law based on individual's religion was controversial in India, from the very start. Sources of Anglo-Hindu law John Mayne, in 1910, wrote that the classical Hindu law has the oldest pedigree of any known system of jurisprudence., Stevens and Hynes, Harvard Law Library Series, see Preface section Mayne noted that while being ancient, the conflicting texts on almost every question presents a great difficulty in deciding what the classical Hindu law was. As more literature emerges, and is translated or interpreted, Mayne noted that the conflict between the texts on every matter of law has multiplied, and that there is a lack of consensus between the Western legal scholars resident in India. Mayne and others used the Smriti to extract elements of Anglo-Hindu law. Sir William Jones translated the Manu Smriti into English, and it was largely the initial basis of Anglo-Hindu law. As new literature, such as Naradasmriti and Mitakshara were discovered, disagreements between the smritis became difficult to resolve. Later writers assumed that the Smritis constituted a single body of law, one part supplementing the other and every part capable of being reconciled with the other. Regional differences in the texts made the situation more complex. =Digests= Two digests were made under European influence. The Vivadarnava Setu was compiled at the request of Warren Hastings and is commonly known as Halhed's Gentoo Code. The Vivada Bhangarnava was compiled at the request of Sir William Jones by Jagannatha Turkapunchanana and translated by Henry Colebrooke. It is commonly referred to as Jagannatha's or Colebrooke's Digest. The Gentoo Code, in its English translation is \\"worthless\\", because Halhed translated it from Persian, not from Sanskrit. This was not the case for Colebrooke's Digest. The code and its development Colonial Hindu legal code marks a large span of nearly two-hundred years, beginning in 1772 and ending in 1947. This time period can be split into two main phases. The first phase, starting in 1772 and ending in 1864, is marked with three main proponents that include the translations of the dharmasastras by the British scholar administrators, the use of court pandits to define laws and rules, and the rise of case law. The second phase, starting in 1864 and ending in 1947, is marked by the dismissal of court pandits, rise of the legislative processes, and a codified law system.Lariviere, Justices and Panditas: Some Ironies in the Hindu Legal Past =Translation of sources= The British were under the conviction that all Indian traditions were based on texts and ignored the tradition's customary significance. Furthermore, they thought that different commentaries and interpretations could be systematically sorted out by school and region. This led to the \\"objectification\\" of India, where the translation of the law code of India rendered it to more colonization. The British cherrypicked the conflicting codes in ancient texts to assist colonial aims, through translation. Warren Hasting's plan of 1772 motivated the British in India to learn Sanskrit as it was necessary for them to govern Bengal. In Hasting's plan Indians were to be governed by Indian principles, particularly in relation to the law. This collection of legal code, picked out from ancient texts of India, came to be known as Anglo-Hindu law. Hastings was aware that British law was too technical, complicated and inappropriate for the conditions in India. In 1774, Hastings wrote to the Lord Chief Justice denying the idea that India was ruled by nothing more than \\"arbitrary wills, or uninstructed judgments, or their temporary rulers\\". Hastings was confident that the Hindus and other original inhabitants of India knew written laws, and these were to be found in ancient Sanskrit texts. Initially, no European in Calcutta knew Sanskrit so Hindu pandits' were hired for the job. The original Sanskrit text was translated into a local language, which was then ultimately re-translated into English. Chains of translations were quite common and negatively impacted the value of the original text. The translation, completed by N. B. Halhed, was published in 1776 as A Code of Gentoo Laws; or Ordinations of the Pundits. The code was used in the East India Company's courts until the early 19th century. =Warren Hastings' Plan of 1772= Warren Hastings was appointed under a new parliamentary act in 1772 to the newly created position of governor-general and was instructed by the Court of Directors to stabilize the governance of the Bengal territories. Hastings' plan for the better administration of Bengal was centered on British officers being designated a \\"collector\\". The collector would be assigned to a defined area (district) with provincial boundaries and would have mixed executive and judicial power in these areas. Hastings is a very significant figure in the realm of British Imperialism; he was the man who knew the natives and who was to represent the forces of law and order. He maintained that the natives had an effective administration structure consonant with Indian theory and practice. Though it was clearly not based on European principles, he premised his plan on this notion. Unfortunately, during the fifty years leading up to Hastings' plan, the Bengali system had nearly collapsed. Fortunately, Hastings was more than qualified to essentially start anew. He had a European education and for the first fifteen years of his career, he was stationed near the court of the last effective provincial governors of Bengal. Hastings knew how an Indian state functioned and believed that it was the textual tradition that was relevant to developing British administrative institutions. Hastings' plan called for two courts. One court dealt with revenue and civil litigation and was called the court of Dewani. The other court dealt with internal order and criminal law and was called the Faujdari court. The \\"collector\\", as mentioned above, acted as a judge as he established the facts in the case based on testimony, most commonly depositions from the witnesses, and the documentary evidence was put before the court. His assistant (dewan) and a pandit then found the law that was applicable to the case. Legal specialists, or law professors, interpreted the codes in the legal texts and provided authoritative decisions on the applicable codes. This was the basis for Anglo- Hindu case law. Hastings' was responsible for rejecting the despotic model of Indian law as he stressed the importance of utilizing \\"Indian law\\" throughout his career. =Colebrooke's Two Schools of Law= Colebrooke was appointed to the East India Company in 1782. He was skilled at Sanskrit and developed his own conception of the nature and function of Hindu law. Colebrooke led the English in fixing an interpretation of variation in legal texts and this eventually became standard in the British courts in India. He suggested that regional variations or differences existed in India, leading to various interpretations of the same text. The term \\"school of law\\" as it applies to legal opinions of India was first used by Colebrooke. Colebrooke established only two schools that were marked by a vital difference of opinion: those who follow the Mitakshara and those who follow the Daya Bhaga. The Daya Bhaga and the Mitakshara differ in the most vital points because each applied different principles. First, the Daya Bhaga treated religious efficacy as the ruling canon in determining the order of succession, rejecting the preference of agnates to cognates. Secondly, the Daya Bhaga denies the doctrine that property is by birth, the cornerstone of the joint family system. Thirdly, the brothers of the joint family system in the Daya Bhaga recognize their right to dispose of their shares at their pleasure. Fourthly, the Daya Bhaga recognizes the right of a widow to succeed her husband's share. Colebrooke's assumed that the commentaries on Hindu legal texts were the works of \\"lawyers, juriscouncils and lawgivers\\", and that these texts were actual law of India before the arrival of Islam, an assumption later scholars found as flawed. Moreover, the British made a false analogy between Hindu law and Muslim law. The British were familiar with the latter, from other British colonies in Africa and the Middle East, as well as having initially worked as agents of the rulers of Mughal Empire. As a result, Colebrooke sought from Hindu texts and yielded a Hindu law to match what were thought of as the schools of Muslim law. In Colebrooke's view each school had fixed \\"doctrines\\" and English judges therefore needed access to the reasons and arguments by which each school supported their doctrine. When Indian scholars could not provide the texts that demonstrated this, European methods were used. After Jones announced that he intended to provide Hindus with their own laws through the mediation of English judges assisted by court appointed pandits, a legal code was in practice. The British sought consistency over time and this created a case law based on precedent. =Jones' Digest= Sir William Jones was appointed judge in the Supreme Court of Calcutta in 1783. He had studied Persian and Arabic at Oxford and had published a number of translations. Additionally, Jones had an active political career and was a very influential figure of the time. After beginning his judicial career in India he found Halhed's code to be more curious than it was useful. Though he had no intention of ever learning Sanskrit, reacting to the defectiveness of the available translations, he became motivated to do so. By 1786, Jones' Sanskrit was good enough to decide between conflicting opinions of his pandits by reading the appropriate translation of the appropriate text. He was able to discern whose interpretation of the law was correct. Jones believed there was a fixed body of laws and codes that had been objects of corruption over time. He wanted to provide the British courts in India, the Crown and the East India Company with a basis on which decisions could be rendered consonant with a pure version of Hindu law. Thus, believed Jones, the Anglo-Hindu law could become consistent and fair. By 1787, Jones had created a plan for the administration of justice in India that reflected the Indian's own principles of jurisprudence. He envisioned a digest (translation completed by Colebrooke) complete with Hindu and Muslim law on the subjects of contracts and inheritances. Jones plan was to find and fix a Hindu civil law with the topics that affected the ownership and transmission of property. In 1788, Jones requested government support from his plan by reiterating to Cornwallis that it would establish a standard of justice with principles and rules accessible to the English. Cornwallis agreed, and from 1788 until his death in 1794 Jones devoted his time to what would become \\"The Digest of Hindu Law on Contracts and Successions\\". By the time of his death he had compiled the Digest in Sanskrit and Arabic and had begun translating them to English. Colebrooke completed the translation in 1797. =Other Anglo-Hindu law manuals= The digests and manuals that followed Halhed's contained more substance and covered more topics of Hindu law, simply because scholars acquired more texts and regional language skills over time. Sir Thomas Strange was the first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Madras from 1801 to 1817. He, in 1825, published a manual of Hindu law.Strange, Thomas Andrew.

Select Cases in Hindu Law Decided by Her Majesty's Privy Council and the Superior Courts in India =Case law= Hindu law was codified by the British in multiple ways: translation, case law, and enactment of various laws based on debate rather than texts. Legislation came to be the strongest source of law in India in so far as it held the highest jurisdiction when sources conflicted.Marc Galanter, Law and Society in Modern India (Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1989) Examples include, *The Hindu Widow's Remarriage Act of 1856: Allowed widows to remarry in certain situations. *The Native Convert's Marriage Dissolution Act of 1866: Allowed for Hindus who had converted to Christianity to dissolve their marriage. *The Child Marriage Restraint Act of 1929: Restricted marriages of children below a certain age. *The Hindu Married Women's Right to Separate Residence and Maintenance Act of 1944: Gave special rights to Hindu married women. =Timeline of Court System= *1726 - Charter by King George I **This is where the British judicial system in India began. **Made important changes to judicial administration in the three main Presidency towns of Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras. *1772 - Plan for the Administration of Justice **Devised by General-Governor Warren Hastings ***Hindu law is formally established as part of the British legal system administered in colonial India. ***\\"In all suits regarding inheritance, marriage, caste and other religious usages or institutions, the laws of the Koran with respect to the Mohamedans and those of Shaster with respect to the Gentoos shall invariably be adhered to\\" (Sec. 27 of the Administration of Justice Regulation of 11 April 1980). *1773 - The East India Company Regulating Act **Made provision to establish Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort William at Calcutta, which would supersede the then prevalent judicial system. *1774 March 26: the Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort William was established. **Supreme Court: had full power and authority to hear and determine all complaints against any of His Majesty's subjects for any crimes and also to entertain, hear and determine any suits or actions against any of His Majesty's subjects in Bengal, Biar, and Orissa. *1780 - The Regulating Act **Important date because it ended the practice of applying English law to Hindus and Muslims. It required all judges to administer the Islamic and Hindu law. Before this, it was certain whether the judges would apply English or religious law in a particular case. *1800 - Established Supreme Court of Madras under Charter issued by King George III *1803 - Established Supreme Court of Bombay under Charter issued by King George III **Replaced the Recorder's Court *1833 - The India Charter Act **Called for the creation of the Indian Law Commission, that would be composed of Hindu legal experts, appointed to identify various rules under Hinduism that could be applied to the laws and court system of British India. They were asked to make recommendations for how to consolidate or amend these laws in ways that would prevent gaps in the law. *1859 - The Code of Civil Procedure and the Law of Limitation *1860 - The Penal Code *1861 - The Code of Criminal Procedure *1861 - The Indian High Court's Act **\\"Reorganized the then prevalent judicial system in the country by abolishing the Supreme Courts at Fort William, Madras, and Bombay, and also the then existing Sadar Adalats in the Presidency Towns. The High Courts were established having civil, criminal, admiralty, vice-admiralty, testimony, intestate, and matrimonial jurisdiction, as well as original and appellate jurisdiction.\\" *1909 - Government of India Act **Allowed for Indian participation, albeit limited, in both provincially and central legislative councils. Important step because it allowed Indians, to have a bigger influence the laws that would be administered to Hindus. *1935 - Government of India Act **Provisions were included for the establishment of a Federal Court, which was necessary in order to make judicial administrations in various provinces more competent between the governmental bodies themselves. This was an important step in unifying India. The Federal Court was a precursor to the Supreme Court of India, which was inaugurated in 1950. =The High Courts of British India= The three High Courts of Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras were established in the three Presidency towns by Letters Patent from Queen Victoria. Before the Indian High Courts Act of 1961, all three Presidencies had Supreme Courts that were in charge of administering justice. Several other High Courts were established during British rule such as the Allahabad High Court and Karnataka High Court, established in 1866 and 1884, respectively. =Judicial Committee of the Privy Council= The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council served as the highest court of appeals for Anglo-Hindu law and British Indian law. The Privy Council, located in London, did not only handle Indian appeal cases, its jurisdiction spanned throughout many parts of the British Empire. With regards to India, the Privy Council was successful at infusing English concepts and principles into the British Indian legal system and they thus became an integral part of Indian law. The right of appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council was retained after Indian independence, but terminated when the Abolition of Privy Council Jurisdiction Act 1949 came into force on 26 January 1950, when the Republic of India was declared. The Federal Court of India was replaced by the Supreme Court of India.

This technique had been superseded by the start of the 18th century, as building in brick or stone became common.The History and Construction of Medieval Timber-Framed Houses in England and Wales - Page 4: Developments, Jettying It was one of the most common features of American colonial architecture of New England and Connecticut, starting 17th century, which had an overhanging or jettied second story, which usually ran across the front of the house, sometimes around it. These are known as a garrison houses. Then in early 20th century it was adapted into the Prairie School architecture, with architects like Frank Lloyd Wright, and thus made way into the modern architecture as well. An overhang may also refer to an awning or other protective elements.

It occurs in the Indo-Pacific. it is an important commercial species within its range and is may be found in the aquarium trade. Description Terapon jarbua is a medium-sized grunter with an oblong body which is moderately laterally compressed. The oblique mouth is oblique with the jaws being of equal length and the maxilla reached the level of the front edge of the eye in juveniles and the centre of the eye inn adults. It has conical, slightly recurved teeth which are set in bands with those in the outer rows being much enlarged, there are teeth on the roof of the mouth in juveniles but in many adults these are absent. There are 11 or 12 spines in the dorsal fin and 9 to 11 rays, the spiny portion is strongly arched, with the fourth to sixth spines being the longest and has a deep notch. The anal fin has 3 spines and 7 to 10 soft rays while the caudal fin is emarginate. They have 75-100 pored scales in their lateral line. They have a silvery white body which has 3 or 4 curved stripes from the nape to the rear of the body with the lowest stripe continues through the centre of the caudal fin. There is a black blotch on the spiny part of the dorsal fin between the third and sixth spines and the tail is striped with a black tip to each lobe. This species sexual maturity after attaining a total length of , they are most commonly recorded at total lengths of around and the longest recorded fish was . Distribution Terapon jarbua has a wide Indo-Pacific distribution which extends from the Red Sea and the coasts of eastern Africa as far south as South Africa through the Indian Ocean, including the Persian Gulf and into the Pacific Ocean as far east as Samoa, its range extends northwards to Japan and south to the Arafura Sea and Lord Howe Island. It was first recorded in the Mediterranean Sea off Israel in 2010 and most likely entered that sea as a Lessepsian migrant through the Suez Canal. Habitat and biology Terapon jarbua is a euryhaline grunter which can tolerate a wide range of salinities from pure freshwater to up to 70% and so can live in a variety of habitats from purely marine areas through costal waters, into estuaries, coastal lagoons and freshwater. It is mainly a marine species bit it may move quite far up rivers where the water is fresh. Juveniles of T. jarbua can be numerous in intertidal area where there are sandy and are frequently recorded in tidal pools. This is a predatory species which feeds on smaller fishes but which also acts as a cleaner fish eating ectoparasites from larger fishes and is known to eat their scales which are high in calories. The distinctive colour and small scales of T, jarbua may be an adaptation to avoid attack by its conspecifics. They will also feed on insects and other invertebrates. The juveniles have been reported as being territorial and to have excavated craters in sand, possibly helping them to keep their position as the tide ebbs and flows. The young fish between standard lengths between are gregarious but become territorial between . They can produce sounds using extrinsic muscles on the swimbladder have been shown to be used for communication and that these sounds to change both as the fish mature and with changes to the fish's environment, Although these fish have been reported as juveniles and adults in freshwater, reproduction takes place in the marine evnvironment. Fisheries Terapon jarbua is fished for using all types of inshore fishing gear, including gillnets, traps, handlines and bottom trawls. These fish are sold fresh or in a dried and salted form. This species is infrequently available in the aquarium trade. Taxonomy Terapon jarbua was first formally described as Sciaena jarbua with the type locality given as Jeddah by the Danish naturalist Johan Christian Fabricius (1745-1808), his description being published in Descriptiones animalium by Peter Forssk√•l who is often cited as the author of the name. The genus Terapon was created by Georges Cuvier in 1816 and in 1876 Pieter Bleeker then designated Holocentrus servus which had been described by Marcus Elieser Bloch in 1790 as the type species of the genus, this was considered to be a junior synonym of Terapon jarbua. Some authorities consider that the taxon currently named Terapon jarbua which has a wide geographic range is actually likely to be more than one species. One possible split would be between the western Indian Ocean species as originally described by Fabricius and the species Bloch described from Japan which would be Terapon servus.

He holds the distinction of being the subject of Illinois's first impeachment trial, held in 1833. Smith was born in New York City and joined the navy before becoming a law student in the offices of Aaron Burr. He was admitted to the New York bar in 1805. In 1816, Smith migrated to Illinois, settling in Edwardsville. He ran for state Attorney General in 1820, but was unsuccessful. In 1822, Smith was elected to the state Senate, where he served for four years. During this time, he was also the editor of a pro-slavery newspaper and attempted to adopt a new Illinois State Constitution in 1823 that would have legalized slavery in the state. One of Smith's political rivals was Governor Ninian Edwards, upon whom Smith once drew a pistol. Edwards grabbed the gun away from Smith and broke Smith's jaw, leaving a scar. Smith was elected as an Associate justice to the Illinois Supreme Court in 1825. In late 1832, he was impeached by the General Assembly on charges of oppressive conduct, corruption, and high misdemeanors. He went on trial in the State Senate in 1833, the only time an impeachment trial has been held in Illinois until the impeachment of Governor Rod Blagojevich in 2009. Smith was acquitted by a vote of 12 for conviction to 10 for acquittal with 4 Senators \\"excused from voting.\\" A two-thirds conviction vote was required. When Jean Baptiste Beaubien sued for the property on which Fort Dearborn stood, Smith wrote the Supreme Court's decision in favor of Beaubien's claim, although it was later overturned by the United States Supreme Court. During the Black Hawk War, Smith served as Quartermaster-General on Governor John Reynolds's staff. and he also served on the first board of commissioners of the Illinois and Michigan Canal. One of Smith's daughters married Judge Jesse B. Thomas. Another daughter was courted by General James Semple, although Smith's rejection of Semple as a suitable suitor turned Semple, who would later serve on the Supreme Court with Smith, into a lifelong enemy.

It was part of STX Europe, a group of international shipbuilding companies owned by the South Korean STX Corporation. Half of Helsinki yard was sold to Russian USC in 2010. In September 2013, STX Finland announced that the Rauma shipyard would be closed in June 2014. In August 2014, the Turku shipyard was sold to Meyer Werft the state-owned Finnish Industry Investment and renamed Meyer Turku Oy.  History  STX Finland Oy was a descendant of different shipyard companies. W√§rtsil√§ operated the shipyards of Helsinki and Turku since the 1930s. W√§rtsil√§ Marine went bankrupt in 1989 after merging with Valmet shipyards. Masa-Yards was established by Martin Saarikangas with financing from the shipping companies to finish the ships under construction, eventually taking over the operations of W√§rtsil√§'s former shipyards. In the mid-90s Kvaerner purchased Masa-Yards and Kvaerner Masa-Yards was born. In 1991 the shipbuilding businesses of Hollming Oy of Rauma and Rauma-Repola of Rauma were merged to form Finnyards. Rauman seudun teollistuminen This company was purchased by Kvaerner and became Aker Finnyards. In January 2005 Kvaerner Masa-Yards and Aker Finnyards merged to form the \\"new\\" Aker Finnyards Oy. The name of the company was changed to Aker Yards Oy on 7 June 2006, and to STX Finland Cruise Oy on 23 November 2008. Since September 2009 the company has been named STX Finland Oy. STX Finland and its predecessors built many luxurious cruise ships, including the very first modern purpose-built cruise ship, the Song of Norway. More recent cruise ships built by the company included the two Oasis-class vessels, Oasis of the Seas (2009) and Allure of the Seas (2010) which held the record for largest cruise ships in the world until 2015 when Harmony of the Seas was launched at STX Europe Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard in France. = 2012‚Äì2013 funding crisis = At end of 2012 STX negotiated with RCCL about an order of a large cruise ship. In order to secure the financial basis of the project, STX sent a request for loan of 50 million euros to the Finnish government and a copy of the request to media. The Finnish government, then led by Katainen Cabinet, was put into a difficult situation. Employment at Turku yard was a sensitive topic for the both ruling parties National Coalition and Social Democrats. While the sum was relatively small, financial status of STX was poor and according to an analysis the actually needed sum would be larger. It looked obvious that STX tried to press the Finnish government to first give a smaller sum which it would later use as a leverage for subsequent demands. The government was in a politically difficult situation, as the public, opposition parties and also own party members wanted to lend the money in order to secure the valuable order. The other option would have been becoming joint owner but the government did not want to have a financially unstable business partner. Instead, the government took another strategy ‚Äì trying to find a new owner for Turku shipyard in secret from the Koreans and buying Helsinki-based naval engineering company Aker Arctic. The man behind the plot was Minister of Economic Affairs, Jan Vapaavuori. Despite of the high pressure, in December 2012 the government refused providing the loan, with the formal excuse that EU does not allow giving subsidies to unprofitable companies. Turku shipyard lost the order which went to French Saint-Nazaire located Chantiers de l'Atlantique where the government was more generous. The decision of the Finnish government was received with consternation and vast criticism from every direction; however, the main opposition group Centre Party was moderate at judging the decision-making politicians, as the party leaders were aware of the poor condition of STX. = Salvage of projects under construction = STX Turku yard had two cruise ships under construction for the German TUI Cruises. The shipowner as well as other financiers of the projects had observed the financial situation of the shipbuilder and became distrustful on STX after the Finnish government's refusal of financing the new project. This led to opening of the financial basis of the TUI orders. The future of Finnish shipbuilding looked bad; a yard without order backlog would be worthless. Therefore, the ongoing projects had to be urgently secured. While the Finnish subsidiary was in crisis, the Korean owner remained passive. Negotiations with STX were challenging because it was difficult to find the right persons who have got the mandate to make decisions in the company, and the creditors, Korean Development Bank as the biggest one, had its word in the financial decisions of the heavily indebted company. The Finnish government got crucially important support from RCCL, main owner of TUI Cruises. RCCL made concessions to secure the financial basis. Speculatively, RCCL wanted to save the yard because it did not want to lose an important part of the global cruise ship building capacity. Moreover, STX sold the Perno shipyard area for ‚Ç¨23.5 million and the state gave innovation support to STX. Financing of the TUI vessels was secured with these actions. = Rauma shipyard closure = The Finnish government and STX made a restructuring plan together with a consulting company in June 2013. According to the report, there would not be sufficient orders for both Turku and Rauma yards, with the recommendation that the Rauma yard should be closed down. At first STX was reluctant to close the Rauma yard, however the management was finally convinced about the need to cut down capacity; STX Europe was in cash crisis and was forced to liquidate some of its property. In September 2013 STX announced the closure of the Rauma yard and the sale of the area to the town of Rauma. While this led to an outcry, it fit perfectly with the plans of the government: the shipbuilding facilities were saved for a new start. Later, a new shipbuilding company Rauma Marine Constructions was established on the western coast. = Selling of Helsinki shipyard and Aker Arctic = The Helsinki shipyard was operated by Arctech which was jointly owned by STX Finland and Russian USC. The Finnish politicians urged Russian owners to buy the Korean half of Arctech. USC became a sole owner in December 2014. The next step was to save Aker Arctic, a Helsinki-based naval engineering company specialised on icebreakers and arctic offshore projects. Again, the STX management as well as representatives of Korean Development Bank, were not willing to discuss. The Finnish government had to organise meeting by help of diplomacy, telling that it is not appropriate to reject a meeting with a minister. The company management did not want to make decisions but later the increasingly weakening situation forced STX to sell more of its property. Finally, STX sold Aker Arctic to Finnish Industry Investment on 17 December 2013. = Selling of Turku yard = The final step was finding a new operator for the Turku shipyard. The secret operation was under name Project Town Hall on classified papers. The Finnish government sought for a credible buyer for the yard and the German Meyer Werft was selected a strong candidate. The family company had significant cruise ship operators as customers but the yard is located in Papenburg, far inland next to a river that sets limits to the maximum size of the ships. Discussion with Meyer Werft was opened by STX Finland board member Lauri Ratia who travelled to Papenburg under assignment of the Finnish government and in secret from his employer. After hearing a cautiously positive answer Ratia contacted minister Vapaavuori who called the head of the family company Bernard Meyer. A Finnish delegation including Vapaavuori flew to Germany in November 2013 for a secret mission to sell a yard which the state did not own and neither had mandate to sell. Everything was done in secrecy because neither the Finnish government, nor Meyer Werft wanted that the Koreans knew about the plan because otherwise the price of the yard would have gone up. During meeting in Papenburg it came out that Meyer Werft was seriously interested in buying Turku shipyard and investing on it. During the visit the delegation noticed that the company puts a lot of effort on productivity and commits on their business; for the delegation, there was no doubt that Meyer Werft would be an ideal operator for Turku yard. STX remained silent for the following months. The Finnish government started pushing the Korean owner; this step was under code name Project Santa Cruz. Vapaavuori travelled to Korea in May 2014 telling that the government has found \\"an unnamed industrial partner\\" which is interested in Turku shipyard. The STX representatives possibly thought that it was a local consortium. The founder of STX Kang Duk- soo was removed from office due to charge of fraud and this probably affected on STX to become more willing to sell the shipyard. Meyer Werft representatives visited at Turku shipyard in the same month and their calculations showed that the yard could be operated profitably. The company made a non-committing quotation for the yard, but buying was subject to having new orders in addition to the ones under construction. The government and Meyer Werft contacted RCCL and TUI Cruises, and after long negotiations, Turku shipyard received orders for two cruise ships from TUI Cruises. Meyer Werft and Finnish state bought Turku shipyard from STX in August 2014 for a nominal price, which, however, included liabilities of about ‚Ç¨20 million.

The main settlements are Nelson, Edwardsville, Quakers Yard, Treharris, Trelewis, and Bedlinog. The valley is situated where the three County Boroughs of Caerphilly, Rhondda Cynon Taff, and Merthyr Tydfil meet. History Originally a collection of farms, from the early 1800s the valley was industrialised through coal mining, developing a rich Industrial heritage. During the Industrial Revolution the area was home to the Trelewis Drift Mine, the Taff Merthyr Colliery and the Deep Navigation collieries. The coal mines closed in the 1980s, and since then the valley has been extensively redeveloped. The culvert through which the river used to run has been blocked off and the river allowed to flow naturally. Two lakes were built and areas were set aside with weirs for canoeing. Paths and bridleways were made linking Treharris and Trelewis and the site of the former Trelewis Drift Mine was converted into the Taff Bargoed Centre with the help of a grant from the Millennium Commission, and became the Welsh International Indoor Climbing Centre. This has one of the biggest climbing walls in the United Kingdom. Parc Taf Bargoed is a regenerated area of parkland in Merthyr Tydfil County Borough and is a Green Flag Park. It is situated in the Taff Bargoed Valley between Trelewis, Treharris and Bedlinog. The former colliery site has been regenerated as a wildlife haven and a base for community activities. The pavilion, at the park gates, houses the warden and provides visitors with information on the history of the park and the wildlife to be found in the area. The building also provides space for community meetings and events and walking, cycling and horse riding is encouraged in the park. The Aberfan Canoe Club and the Parc Taff Bargoed Anglers Club meet here and periodically there are canoeing, kayaking and raft building activities.

Medicaid is available, and there is also a scheme for assistance to families of State employees. Insurance coverage for low income families A major contributor to covering children in the state of Idaho is Health Insurance Premium Assistance. This is an access card available for children. This access card allows parents to purchase private health insurance. This card is very useful and allows parents and families to purchase health insurance when their children meet the guidelines. It is meant to help make insurance more affordable to low waged families. A low wage family, as classified by this program, would be a family whose income is mandatory Medicaid levels, but below 185 federal poverty level (FDL). These families also have to be employed by the State of Idaho, who they must be a spouse of an Idaho employee. When a child meets the eligibility conditions they qualify for at least $100 per month in premium assistance. A family that has more than three children are eligible to receive $300 per month, but they are required to pay deductibles, co-pays, and insurance premiums. Medicaid Another program that the state of Idaho offers is Medicaid, which is direct coverage for children. In order for a children to receive Medicaid, they are reviewed on their health needs. Once enrolled, the person must undergo health screening, and is then placed into a primary care case management system. Medicaid consists of three different plans that are characterized to fit differing needs. The principal plan for children is the Medicaid Basic Plan. ‚ÄúThe Medicaid Basic Plan is for healthy low-income children and adults with eligible dependent children.

It is a division of Justin Brands, Inc., itself owned by Berkshire Hathaway. History H.J. \\"Daddy Joe\\" Justin started repairing boots in Spanish Fort, Texas. After receiving a loan to purchase materials, he began making his own cowboy boots. Justin was an early user of decorative stitching, incorporating rows of stitches across the boot tops as a means of stiffening the leather, preventing it from folding around the ankles.Irvin Farman. Standard of the West: the Justin story. TCU Press; October 1996 [cited 14 February 2012]. . p. 209‚Äì. In 1887, Justin married Louanna ‚ÄúAnnie‚Äù Allen. In the early 1890s, Annie Justin developed a self-measuring kit, making it possible for customers to order the company's products by mail. When a railroad was built in Nocona, Texas, in 1889, the Justins moved there to capitalize on the larger market opportunity. \\"Daddy Joe\\" and Annie had seven children ‚Äî three sons and four daughters ‚Äî who each helped with the family business. In 1908, Justin told his two oldest sons, John and Earl, that they would become equal partners in the family business. He then changed the name of his boot company to H.J. Justin & Sons. The Justins moved the business to Fort Worth, Texas in 1925, except for daughter Enid Justin, who believed her father would have wanted the business to remain in Nocona. She later founded Nocona Boots. In 1947, annual sales reached $1 million. Three years later, Joe‚Äôs grandson, John Justin Jr., bought out the company‚Äôs stock and gained control of the company. On Nov. 3, 1950, John Jr. became vice president and general manager of H.J. Justin & Sons, Inc. The company merged with Acme Brick Company in 1968 to become First Worth Corporation. In 1972, John Justin Jr. was elected president and chairman of the board, and the company‚Äôs name officially changed to Justin Industries, Inc. Nocona Boot Company became part of Justin Industries when John Justin purchased the controlling shares from his aunt, Enid Justin, in 1981. In 1984, the company acquired Chippewa Shoe Company. In 1990, Justin Industries purchased competitor Tony Lama Boots. In 1999, John Justin stepped down from his role as chairman of the board of Justin Industries, Inc., and in 2000 the board of directors for Justin Industries approved the sale of the company to Warren Buffett and the Berkshire-Hathaway Corp.  Support for Rodeo  Justin Boots supports professional cowboys through the Justin Sportsmedicine Team and the Justin Cowboy Crisis Fund.

Benny did meet John and Ian when they were playing with Glenn Hughes and Benny's previous band Fortune opened for Glenn Hughes on his Japan tour in 1994, and guitar player Jan Granwick (Glory) have Benny known for years so he was also asked to participate. Benny felt that he wanted to make an album with all the elements that he thought a good album should have, nice melody and good musician ship. Not just jump onto the next music scene that appears 'cause it has changed. Together with Christer Wedin at Empire Records they set plans for this project.

After the successful release of Clockwise debut album \\"Nostalgia\\", which received rave reviews all over the world, the second album called \\"Na√Øve\\", was released. And again, Benny S√∂derberg asked his musician friends, who participated on the first album, to record this follow up album. Therefore, you will again find, John Lev√©n bass and Ian Haugland drums from Europe, as the solid rhythm section. Contractual reason made it impossible for guitar player Jan Granwick to participate on this second record. Therefore, the guitar axe man Fredrik √Ökesson (Talisman, Arch Enemy, Southpaw now with Opeth) was asked to play with Clockwise on this record and so he did.

The sorority officially affiliated with Phi Mu fraternity on August 30, 1939.  Beginnings  Ten female students at Transylvania College in Lexington, Kentucky formed Alpha Theta, a local sorority. Alpha Theta approached an unnamed national sorority about membership; their request was denied because of Alpha Theta's affiliation with Hamilton, a junior college for women. Having heard that the National Panhellenic Conference \\"declared the number of national sororities was too small\\", the Alpha Thetas decided to form their own national group. On November 10, 1921, Alpha Theta became Alpha Delta Theta (Lamb, p. 45).  A National Organization  Within three years of existence, Alpha Delta Theta created 8 collegiate chapters. The sorority was granted \\"associate membership\\" by the National Panhellenic Conference in October 1923. Three years later, the sorority had full membership. \\"It was admitted to the Congress at an earlier date in its history than any other fraternity\\" (Lamb, p. 45). On March 15, 1926, Alpha Delta Theta is incorporated as a national organization in the state of Kentucky (Lamb, p. 45). Alpha Delta Theta grew quickly and with much strength in its twenty years of existence. Two years after its founding, the sorority began expanding to other campuses. The History of Phi Mu: The First 130 Years (1982) mentioned that Alpha Delta Theta had installed \\"a total of 25 collegiate chapters and 21 alumnae groups\\" (p. 45). The 1932- 1933 academic year was especially noteworthy for ADT, as \\"it had the distinction of breaking all fraternity records in scholarship... when 34 per cent of its chapters held first place in scholarship on their respective campuses\\" (Lamb, p. 45).  Merger with Phi Mu  In spite of these gains, Alpha Delta Theta had come into its flowering somewhat late when compared to the other established chapters on its campuses, and thus faced several difficulties. During the 1920s, while Alpha Delta Theta was prospering in the establishment of chapters, competing organizations had not been idle. There was a massive wave of building projects sweeping through those same venerable campuses where Alpha Delta Theta was placing its chapters. A decade, or sometimes multiple decades of alumni were able to bankroll and guarantee these projects where a startup chapter may not have such resources. Perhaps in a more kind economy, the passage of time would have resolved this in Alpha Delta Theta's favor, but the strain of the Great Depression meant that Greek participation dropped precipitously; larger chapters became shells of themselves, while small chapters were wiped out. Rather than a steep downturn followed by a quick, roaring reset to the economy, the Great Depression lingered, and more than anything, this led to a crisis where chapter after chapter failed: valued chapters on impressive campuses. National officers and chapter alumnae were faced with the potential of complete loss, a prospect that had been unthinkable just five years prior. (Lamb, p. 42) Thus, Alpha Delta Theta was not able to survive the 1930s. \\"With some larger chapter houses that were unable to cope with the post-depression years and with the extensive campus building programs necessary to be competitive, its Grand Council decided to take an unprecedented step\\" (Lamb, p. 42). In the summer of 1938, Alpha Delta Theta officers sought out a national organization with history, values, and ideals similar to their own- Phi Mu was ultimately chosen. Carefully and quietly, Alpha Delta Theta and Phi Mu prepared the Letter of Agreement and other pertinent legal documents required for the distribution of Alpha Delta Theta's assets. \\"All officers, chapters and alumnae groups were contacted in January 1939, and by May the unanimous approval as required by both Constitutions, was in hand\\" (Lamb p. 42). \\"Unanimous approval\\" was an extraordinary feat in itself, and makes clear the focus that this crisis allowed these leaders. The summer was spent answering questions and resolving concerns about the merger. The affiliation became official on August 30, 1939 (Lamb, p. 43). At the conclusion of the 26th session of the National Panhellenic Conference in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, on November 4, 1939, ADT's NPC delegate Violet Young Gentry announced her organization's affiliation with Phi Mu fraternity. The next day, Alpha Delta Theta corporation was dissolved. Phi Mu officers began initiating collegiate and alumnae members of Alpha Delta Theta. Phi Mu gained five new chapters through affiliation and eight through campus mergers. Four new alumnae groups from Alpha Delta Theta were installed as Phi Mu alumnae chapters; ADT's eighteen alumnae groups in cities where Phi Mu had alumnae chapters were disbanded and absorbed into Phi Mu (Lamb, p. 43).  Alpha Delta Theta Insignia and Traditions  The local, Alpha Theta, used \\"Esse Non Videri\\" for the motto; the sweet pea for the flower; silver and Turquoise blue for the colors. The badge of Alpha Delta Theta is described as being of yellow gold, Delta shaped, and \\"superimposed upon a gold key placed horizontally\\" (Lamb, p. 44). The center of the Delta was black enamel. Within the Delta, the Alpha was in the lower left hand angle, the Delta in the apex, and the theta in the lower right hand angle. Between the Alpha and theta was a \\"lighted candle in a candlestick.... with crossed palm branches above\\" (Lamb, p. 44). The border could have fifteen pearls with an emerald at each angle of the Delta. The pledge pin was \\"a vertical bar of silver, bearing the raised letters, Alpha Delta Theta, one above the other\\" (Lamb, p. 44). Emily H. Butterfield, in College Fraternity Heraldry, (1931) described the coat-of-arms as \\"argent; on a chief gules three keys of the first per fess, in base two palm branches saltirewise vert. Crest. A candle argent in candlestick flared of the same. Supporters. Two unicorns proper\\" (p. 28). The motto, a Greek phrase, was written on a banner under the shield. This coat-of-arms was adopted at the national convention in 1928- it is based entirely on ritualistic symbolism (Butterfield, p. 28). The official publications were The Portals and The Silhouette (Lamb, p. 45) The national philanthropy was the supplying of books and periodicals to Buffalo School, Moore's Creek, Kentucky (Lamb, p. 45). The school was remote, rural, and obviously in need of reading materials. Founder's Day was celebrated every November 10. All members gave one dollar to the Alpha Delta Theta philanthropic project (Lamb, p. 45).  Chapters  The chapters of Alpha Delta Theta.

Background  Liu Ji was born in 757 ‚Äî during the Anshi Rebellion, when Fanyang Circuit (ËåÉÈôΩ, later known as Lulong), where his father Liu Peng was from, was governed by the rebel state Yan, which rivaled Tang Dynasty, then ruled by Emperor Suzong.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 219. Liu Ji had at least two younger brothers, Liu Yong () and Liu Yuan (). After Yan's destruction in 763, Fanyang, renamed Lulong, was nominally reintegrated into Tang, but was then governed successively by Li Huaixian and Zhu Xicai, both of whom ruled it de facto independently from the Tang imperial government. In 772, Liu Peng's cousin Zhu Ci became military governor after assassinating Zhu Xicai, and Liu Peng thereafter successively served under Zhu Ci and his brother Zhu Tao.Old Book of Tang, vol. 143 . Liu Ji himself visited the capital Chang'an in his youth and passed the imperial examinations.New Book of Tang, vol. 212 . In 785, after Zhu Tao died, Liu Peng succeeded him.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 231. Liu Ji served as the prefect of Mo Prefecture (Ëé´Â∑û, in modern Cangzhou, Hebei) under his father. Later in 785, when Liu Peng grew ill, Liu Yong was by Liu Peng's side, and he quickly summoned Liu Ji back from Mo Prefecture and supported him to succeed their father.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 234. The emperor at that time, Emperor Suzong's grandson Emperor Dezong, thus made Liu Ji acting military governor. Liu Peng died soon thereafter, and Liu Ji succeeded him.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 232.  As military governor  While the military governors of the region were generally ruling their circuits de facto independently from the imperial regime at the time, Liu Ji was said to treat Emperor Dezong with respect, often offering tributes, and Emperor Dezong also treated him with respect, making him honorary minister of defense. Soon, however, he was embroiled in a dispute with his brother Liu Yong. When he succeeded Liu Peng with Liu Yong's support, he made Liu Yong the prefect of Ying Prefecture (ÁÄõÂ∑û, in modern Cangzhou) and promised to let Liu Yong succeed him. However, Liu Ji soon made his oldest son Liu Gun () deputy military governor, apparently designating Liu Gun as his successor. By 792, Liu Yong, displeased, directly submitted to Emperor Dezong and contributed soldiers to the winter defense against Tufan to the west of Chang'an. Liu Ji, in anger, attacked Liu Yong. By 794, Liu Yong, unable to stand against Liu Ji, abandoned Ying Prefecture and took his soldiers and people west to the region directly under imperial control. In 796, as part of a large number of honorary titles given to military governors, Liu Ji was made honorary chancellor with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). In 800, another brother, Liu Yuan, then the prefect of Zhuo Prefecture (Ê∂øÂ∑û, in modern Baoding, Hebei), was resistant of Liu Ji's orders, and Liu Ji defeated and captured him.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 235. Liu Ji then delivered him to Chang'an, where Emperor Dezong gave him a minor office and let him stay in Chang'an. In 806, by which time Emperor Dezong's grandson Emperor Xianzong was emperor, Liu Ji was given the greater honorary chancellor title of Shizhong (). In 807, he had disputes with his neighboring military governors ‚Äî Wang Shizhen the military governor of Chengde Circuit and Zhang Maozhao () the military governor of Yiwu Circuit (Áæ©Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Baoding), and Emperor Xianzong had to dispatch the imperial attendant Fang Shi () to mediate.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 237. In 809, Wang Shizhen died, and Emperor Xianzhong initially refused to follow Emperor Dezong's precedent and allow Wang Shizhen's son Wang Chengzong to succeed as military governor of Chengde, until he extracted from Wang Chengzong a promise to surrender two of Chengde's prefectures to imperial control. Wang Chengzong soon reneged on the promise, however, and Emperor Xianzong ordered a campaign against Chengde. Liu Ji's emissary to Weibo Circuit (È≠èÂçö, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), Tan Zhong (), was able to persuade Weibo's military governor Tian Ji'an not to join Chengde's cause, and then persuaded Liu Ji himself to attack Chengde ‚Äî pointing out that if he did not, Emperor Xianzong would believe that he was complicit in Wang Chengzong's resistance. In spring 810, Liu Ji thus launched his own campaign against Chengde, capturing a number of towns. Emperor Xianzong gave him the honorary chancellor title of Zhongshu Ling ().Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 238. Meanwhile, Liu Ji had his second son Liu Zong accompany him on the campaign, while leaving Liu Gun in charge at headquarters. As Liu Ji was at Raoyang (È•íÈôΩ, in modern Hengshui, Hebei), he grew ill. In Liu Ji's illness, Liu Zong conspired with the staff members Zhang Qi () and Cheng Guobao (), forging orders that indicated that Emperor Xianzong was displeased with Liu Ji's lack of progress and read to replace him with Liu Gun. Liu Ji, in shock and anger, executed tens of officers who were friendly to Liu Gun and issued an order summoning Liu Gun. Liu Zong then poisoned Liu Ji's drink, and Liu Ji died of poisoning.

It is the interchange of the following routes: The interchange permits traffic entering the interchange in all directions to exit in all directions (unlike, for example, the Hollywood Split and East Los Angeles Interchange). The interchange also contains Metro Green Line tracks, direct HOV and Metro ExpressLanes connectors, and the Harbor Transitway, all of which contribute to the towering, imposing structure for which the interchange is known. The interchange is over 130 feet high. Opened with Interstate 105 in 1993, the interchange is named after Harry Pregerson, a longtime federal judge who presided over the lawsuit concerning the I-105 freeway's construction.ACR 142 Assembly Concurrent ResolutionDana Bartholomew, \\"Every day is Valentine's Day\\", Los Angeles Daily News, February 14, 2010. Layout Motorists entering the interchange on the freeway trunks from all directions have freedom to exit the interchange in all possible directions of travel (i.e., it is a complete interchange). Nearly all ramps are direct (an inherent advantage of the stack interchange design) and can be driven at near-mainline speeds if not congested; the main exception is the ramp from northbound I-110 to westbound I-105, which is a cloverleaf loop. However, traffic using the interchange's left-side connectors between the I-105 carpool (HOV) lanes and the I-110 Metro ExpressLanes (high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes) is more restricted. Motorists entering eastbound or westbound on the I-105 HOV lanes may connect to the northbound I-110 HOT lanes. Motorists entering the interchange on the southbound I-110 HOT lanes may connect to either the eastbound or westbound I-105 HOV lanes, while motorists entering northbound on the I-110 HOT lanes do not have direct HOV connectors to I-105 and may only continue northbound. HOV/HOT drivers wishing to connect to a direction of travel for which there is no direct left-side connector must exit the HOV/HOT lane at a designated entry/exit point before the interchange and use the mainline connectors, as is typical for HOV lanes in Southern California. =Public transit= = Metro Green Line and Harbor Transitway= The interchange also houses the Harbor Freeway Metro station which jointly serves the Metro Green Line light rail and Harbor Transitway bus corridor, which travel down the medians of I-105 and I-110, respectively. History As described in a 1989 Los Angeles Times article, the interchange, connecting the existing I-110 with the new I-105 (then called the Century Freeway), was designed to be \\"biggest, tallest, most costly traffic structure yet built by California Department of Transportation\\" and \\"the first time the state's traffic engineers have integrated three modes of transportation--light-rail trains, high-occupancy vehicles and individual cars--into one giant intersection\\".Ronald B. Taylor, \\"Soaring Interchange on Century Freeway to Be One of a Kind\\", Los Angeles Times, December 10, 1989. In 1996, the U.S. Federal Highway Administration recognized the Interstate 105/Interstate 110 interchange with an Award of Merit in the Urban Highways category of its biennial Excellence in Highway Design awards. The award recognized the interchange's design, which sought to improve traffic congestion, safety, and air quality. =In film= Shortly before the interchange opened, filmmakers had access to use it for the 1994 motion picture Speed. In one of the movie's best-known scenes, the bus must jump across an unfinished construction gap in an uncompleted elevated freeway-to- freeway ramp while still under construction. The fifth-level HOV flyover (I-110 SB to I-105 WB) that the bus jumped had already been completed, so a gap was added in the editing process using computer-generated imagery. For a full weekend in 2015, the left-side connector ramps between the I-105 HOV lanes and the I-110 HOT ExpressLanes were closed for filming the opening musical number of La La Land.

After home schooling Bonham was accepted into Corpus Christi College, Oxford where he finished his BA in 1807, joining Lincoln's Inn in 1808 and being called to the bar (although he never practised law) in 1814. Political career In August 1830 he was elected a Member of Parliament for Rye and served as assistant Tory Party whip until 1831, when he was defeated in the general election. After his defeat he continued to work in Rye as a party agent for the 1832 election, and until 1837 acted as the Tory Party's chief electoral expert (replacing William Holmes). He served as Storekeeper of the Ordnance in Robert Peel's first government from 1834 and in 1835 was again returned to parliament, this time for Harwich where he served until 1837 and again also served as assistant whip. Later life Despite being out of parliament in 1841 Peel again appointed him Storekeeper of the Ordnance, a position he resigned in 1845 after a scandal involving improperly-bought railway shares. He remained as an unpaid volunteer until 1853, when he was appointed as a Commissioner for Income Tax to prevent him from becoming bankrupt.

Fish from Puerto Rico have greyish bodies, translucent pectoral fins, pointed pelvic fins and a caudal fin shaped like a crescent moon. Fish from Mexico and Belize are slightly smaller and have a darker body colour with dark pectoral fins, blunt pelvic fins and a short, square-cut caudal fin. Distribution and habitat The species is native to the central West Atlantic Ocean. Its range extends from southeastern Florida and the Bahamas, through the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico to Santa Marta in Colombia and to the islands off the coast of Venezuela. It is a reef fish, inhabiting reefs with both stony corals and soft corals. Ecology As a simultaneous hermaphrodite, H. nigricans has an unusual reproductive strategy known as egg trading. The fish is usually solitary, but at breeding time two fish come together at night. Courtship is initiated by one fish which temporarily takes a female role. The other fish acts as the male and fertilises a batch of eggs produced by the first fish. The following night their roles are reversed, and the second fish lays eggs and the first fish fertilises them. The two fish continue alternating roles in this way over the course of several nights. The pair usually stay together for the series of transfers, but sometimes each finds a different partner. Status H. nigricans has a wide range and is a common fish.

It has been suggested that H. unicolor is a mimic of the foureye butterflyfish (Chaetodon capistratus) and this proposition was based on resemblances in their colour patterns and general shape, their shared use of similar habitats in shallow waters and the comparative scarcity of H. unicolor and their prey preferences, H. unicolor feeds on mobile benthic animals while C. capistratus preys on sessile benthic invertebrates. However, H. unicolor varies in colour and pattern geographically whereas C. capistratus does not and their juveniles do not resemble each other either.

She was best known as a painter of landscapes and townscapes of the towns and cities of the West Riding of Yorkshire, particularly the County town of Wakefield, its surrounding area, and the city of York.\\"Views of Wakefiels, Then and Now\\", Hepworth blog , 2013  Life  Louisa Fennell was born in the Wakefield area of the West Riding of Yorkshire in 1847. She died in 1930.  Work  Fennel was a watercolourist who exhibited widely in the North of England. For example, her watercolour entry to the 1884 Spring exhibition in Derby was singled out by the local newspaper as \\"particularly noticeable\\". \\"The water colours are numerous and there are many good ones ...including as they do such names as P.J. Hammond, H. Earp, Mrs Henry Hime, Mrs Mundy, Louise Fennel, etc. Those of the last named are particularly noticeable, as are the productions of Messrs. W.H.J. Boot and W.C. Keene.\\" In 1881 she departed from her usual subject-matter and published an album of 12 lithographs on The Life of Saint Paul in Rome, which a reviewer in the Magazine of Art described as \\"not very well done\\" in a round-up of what leading women artists had been working on.Elree I.

The Hepworth Wakefield has a collection of her works, described as \\"a much loved part of The Wakefield Permanent Art Collection\\", and sells modern reproductions of them as prints and notecards.The Hepworth Wakefield, search on Fennell Between 1876 and 1882 she exhibited 11 works at the Royal Society of British Artists and between 1869 and 1894 9 works at the Society of Women Artists. She also had work included in the Yorkshire Jubilee Exhibition (1887) and the Glasgow International Exhibition of 1888. She is most famous for her watercolour paintings of local Wakefield scenes including Wakefield Cathedral and Wakefield Chantry Chapel at the turn of the 20th century (1898‚Äì1904). Also Sandal Castle painted in 1876 prints of which were donated by the owner to Wakefield City Art Gallery and more recently to the Hepworth Gallery. Later Louisa painted views of other cities, in particular Micklegate and Monk Gate in the city of York. A retrospective exhibition of her work was held at Wakefield City Art Gallery in September 1936. In March 1950 an exhibition of her paintings was opened by the provost of Wakefield at the gallery. After her death, nine of her Wakefield scenes were donated by her family to Wakefield City Art Gallery, in addition to a copy of The Life of Saint Paul in Rome and her original illustrations. Seventeen of her works are now the property of Wakefield City Metropolitan District Council.  Views of Wakefield  The set of seventeen scenes of Wakefield consist of the following sixteen watercolour paintings and one black and white drawing: # Northgate, Wakefield, 1898 -- Looking up Northgate, the cathedral can be seen in the background. # Almshouse Lane, Wakefield, 1898 -- Almshouse Lane shown with a gate, before it was paved. This area was later demolished and became the site of the Ridings Shopping Centre in 1983. # Old houses on Westgate, Wakefield, 1899 -- Three timber framed houses, possibly Medieval and long since demolished. # Bread Street, Wakefield, 1900 -- Bread Street looking towards the cathedral. # Marygate, Wakefield, 1900 -- Marygate, at the junction of Wood Street and Westgate. This area has changed considerably. # Wakefield Cathedral from the east, 1900 -- The cathedral (4) from the east. (Kirkgate to the left, and Teall Street to the right). # The Six Chimneys, Wakefield, 1900 -- This timber-framed building on Kirkgate, said to date back to the time of John of Gaunt, collapsed in 1941 due to careless structural alteration. # Cross Square, Wakefield, 1900 -- Cross Square in 1900. (Marygate is to the left and Silver Street to the right). The old house was demolished that year. # Warrengate and the Springs, Wakefield, 1900 -- Warrengate and the Springs looking up the hill towards the cathedral, which can be seen in the distance. (Warrengate was once one of the entrances to parkland belonging to the Earls of Warren) # The Market Cross, Wakefield, painted c. 1900 -- The Market Cross in Cross Square with the cathedral in the background. The cross built in 1707 by public subscription, was used for public meetings and for the sale of eggs, butter and poultry, and demolished, despite public protest, in 1866. # The Shepherd's Rest, Wakefield, c. 1900 -- This public house was off George Street, near what was once the Cattle Market. Now demolished, the old public house pictured here was still much the same up to the 1950s. # The Old Bakehouse, Westgate, Wakefield, c. 1900 -- A watercolour painting of the old bakehouse, showing the gable end of the building at the front of the picture, with two doors and four chimneys. # The Old Bakehouse, Westgate, Wakefield, around 1900 -- A black and white drawing very similar to the last painting. # The Chantry Chapel on Wakefield Bridge, 1901 -- The bridge Chapel (5) is one of only three surviving in the UK, and was built in 1357, a hundred years before the Battle of Wakefield. The bridge had been erected in 1342. # The Shambles, Wakefield, 1902 -- The Shambles from the Bull Ring. This was situated between Cross Square and the Bullring. # Westgate Bridge, Wakefield, 1903 -- Now part of Westgate End, Westgate Bridge was once a real bridge across Alverthorpe Beck and Balne Beck, which run under Westgate, before joining the River Calder at Thornes. # The newspaper shop in Butcher Row, Wakefield, 1904 -- Butcher Row, off Cross Square, Wakefield, since demolished. The painting shows a view looking up Butcher Row towards the corner of Westgate, Silver Street and Wood Street. Other paintings of Wakefield include: #Man And Child On A Lane With A View Of Wakefield Beyond #Distant View of Wakefield in Yorkshire #SANDAL CASTLE PAINTED IN 1876  Other scenes  In addition to watercolour paintings of Wakefield, Louisa also painted many other landscapes and townscapes, including these: *Burnsall Church *Rievaulx Abbey *The Steps at Haddon Hall, Derbyshire *A Village Green with Figures Hanging Out Washing Beside a Church *On the Rhoen (Bedford, Bedfordshire (GB)) *Micklegate, York *Monkgate, York *York Street Scene with Figures *Street Scenes *City Walls, York *BYLAND ABBEY (Watercolour) *Ripon Cathedral (Watercolour) References External links * The National Archives * Yorkshire Sculpture Triangle * Twixt Aire and Calder - images of the paintings  Further reading  * Louisa Fennell of Wakefield and Her World, 1847-1930, exhibition, with a printed catalogue of 14pp, at the Wakefield Museum in 1978. 1847 births 1930 deaths English women painters English watercolourists Artists from Wakefield 19th-century English painters 20th-century English painters 19th-century British women artists 20th-century British women artists Women watercolorists ","title":"Louisa Fennell"},{"id":"20629105","text":"The Internationalist Workers Party (Parti ouvrier internationaliste, POI) was a French Trotskyist party established in 1936 after the exclusion of militant Trotskyists from the French Section of the Workers' International in 1935 and dissolved in 1939 when most of the militants had rejoined the Workers and Peasants' Socialist Party.

It is found in shallow waters in the tropical IndoPacific on reefs, resting on coral heads much of the time. Etymology The genus name Paracirrhites derives from the Greek word para, meaning \\"the side of\\" plus the Latin word cirrus, meaning \\"curl\\". The species name arcatus, meaning \\"arched\\", refers to the U-shaped marking around the eyes. Description Arc-eye hawkfish at Kona, Hawaii Paracirrhites arcatus grows to a maximum size of 20 cm in length, and occurs in a variety of colors. The body may be greenish-brown, dark brown or reddish-orange, while the tail usually is bluish. A broad, longitudinal white band runs along the distal half of the body. A characteristic ring-shaped or U-shaped tricolor marking (red, blue and yellow) occurs around and behind the eyes. The dorsal fin has ten spines and eleven soft rays, and the anal fin has three spines and six soft rays. These voracious predators are very territorial. They spend most of their time perched on corals, especially Acropora, Stylophora, and Pocillopora genera, waiting for prey to approach too close. They mostly feed on small fishes, shrimps, and crabs but also eat isopods, fish eggs and larvae. These fish occasionally find their way into the aquarium trade. Distribution The arc-eye hawkfish is widespread in the tropical Indo-Pacific. Its range extends from East Africa, Madagascar and the Maldives to Hawaii, southern Japan and western, northern and eastern Australia. Habitat The arc-eye hawkfish is a benthic species associated with coral reefs. It usually can be found in lagoon and seaward reefs, at a depth of , with a maximum of .

Career Born in West Hartlepool, County Durham, Brown signed for Manchester United as an 18-year- old in May 1946, just as football was getting going again after the Second World War. He turned professional three months later, in August 1946, but it was not until January 1948 that he made his debut for the club, saving a penalty in a 2‚Äì1 defeat away to Sheffield United on 31 January 1948. After making way for Jack Crompton, Brown returned to the first team for two successive away wins in March 1948, keeping clean sheets against both Huddersfield Town and Bolton Wanderers. Brown had to wait until the following season to make his next appearance for the club, which also happened to be his last. In the only game missed by Jack Crompton during the 1948‚Äì49 season, Brown kept goal at home to Blackpool on 1 September 1948. However, he was unable to prevent the team from succumbing to a 4‚Äì3 defeat. He was transferred to Doncaster Rovers the following January. In two-and-a-half seasons with Doncaster, Brown made just four appearances and he left for Hartlepools United ‚Äì via Stockton ‚Äì in August 1951. Berry was much more suited to football in the lower divisions and became Hartlepools United's regular goalkeeper, making 126 league appearances for the club before retiring from football in June 1956, at the age of 28.

It is the type strain for the genus Azomonas. A. agilis resembles protists with its ovoid, ellipsoidal, or coccoid cells. The cells are relatively large, usually 2.5-6.4 Œºm long and 2.0-2.8 Œºm wide, though giant cells that are 10.0-13.5 Œºm have been described. The cells have peritrichous flagella which enable motility. The species also produces a diffusible yellow-green or red-violet pigment which fluoresces bluish-white under ultraviolet light. A. agilis was first isolated and described by Martinus Beijerinck in 1901, who obtained the species from Dutch canal water in Delft. Beijernick's original strain has been lost, so the strain isolated by Albert Kluyver and van den Bout is now the neotype. Despite the fact that mannitol was used by Beijerinck in his enrichment medium for A. agilis, the bacteria in pure culture cannot use it as a carbon source unless it is first degraded by other microbes. The species can tolerate salt concentrations up to 1.0% and is resistant to iodoacetate (1 ŒºM) which suggests it may have ability to live in contaminated waters with relatively high concentrations of organic matter and mineral salts. This bacterium has also been implicated in the bioremediation of cadmium-polluted water.You KM, Park YK.

It is an inhabitant of reefs where it is found in large colonies at depths of around . This species hides in its burrow at night, completely sealing the entrance. Every morning, it rebuilds the burrow entrance. It can reach a length of TL. It can also be found in the aquarium trade. The blue-spotted jawfish was first discovered in the Tropical Eastern Pacific by Gerald Allen and David R. Robertson in 1991. They belong to the class of Actinopterygii. Description The blue-spotted jawfish have an electric-blue spotting over a yellow or orange body with an elegant yellow dorsal fin. They have large eyes that make them look as \\"alien\\". The males have stark white in their anterior halves. The females and the non-courting males are dark brown and have larger blue spots. The younger jawfish are uniformly colored yellow with blue spots. Biology Jawfish are named for their large mouths, which allow them to catch food. Their large mouths also allow them to dig their burrows by taking big mouthfuls of sand and spitting them out in order to create their hideaways. Some jawfish consume worms, crustaceans, and invertebrates, but the blue-spotted jawfish feeds on tiny animals: benthic and planktonic invertebrates. They are colonial species and can be found in quite large colonies. Habitat The blue-spotted jawfish are very social amongst other members of its own species. They are not aggressive except to those who try to enter their burrows. They are found in cold water at deeper depth of the ocean in sandy rubbles and reef areas. They live in colonies of up to several hundred fish, with a minimal spacing of between individuals. They cover their burrow entrance at dusk and rebuild the opening every morning. Unlike the Opistognathus aurifrons, the blue-spotted jawfish only spend time out and above their burrows during the warm summer season. Health There are two diseases that can affect the blue-spotted jawfish. First of all, the Brooklynellosis and blue-spotted jawfish disease. When the blue-spotted jawfish are affected by the Brooklynella, it is likely that they will deteriorate and die within approximately 24 hours. The symptoms of Brooklynellosis include: peeling skin and color loss all over the body, or no appetite. They may leave their burrow and list around until they eventually die. Edit: Brookynella is easily treated in a quarantine tank using malachite green in combination with formalin. The so-called \\"Blue spot jawfish disease\\" is almost always damage to the fish caused by; rough handling, coarse or abrasive substrate, being kept on bare glass, or, from being kept at above 21c. Reproduction Jawfish are mouth brooders, they utilize their mouth to hold the eggs until they reach the hatching point. They incubate the eggs in their mouths for about 5 to 7 days. In addition, males display behaviorally and color-wise in the summer months by becoming bright white, dashing above their burrow, trying to attract the females. If the male is successful attracting the female, then the female join his tube for a few minutes after returning in hers. Name The specific name honours Richard H. Rosenblatt (1930-2014), an ichthyologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, who made many contributions to the study of the fishes of the eastern Pacific.

The founders‚Äô initial goal was to develop innovative agricultural products and market them throughout the Midwestern United States. These early products, including mold inhibitors and flavors, quickly grew to encompass a full line of ingredients for animal feed that was sold nationwide. By the late 1960s, Kemin was exporting products to distributors in Holland and Spain. Within five years, growing demand for Kemin products justified a European sales and production site, which was established in Herentals, Belgium in 1970. During the 1980s, Kemin expanded beyond the animal feed industry into the human food industry. The same chemistry used to manufacture mold inhibitors and antimicrobials for animal feed was also effective at inhibiting mold and bacteria in human food. By 1992, Kemin began applying its antioxidant expertise into the pet food industry. In 1988, a second international headquarters was established in Singapore. In 1994, Kemin opened manufacturing and sales operations in Zhuhai, China. Two years later, Kemin established operations in Chennai, India. Due to expansion, manufacturing later moved to Gummidipundi, two hours outside of Chennai. The company‚Äôs first human division ‚Äî human nutrition and health ‚Äî demerged in 1995 when Kemin introduced FloraGLO Lutein. With a team marketing and selling Kemin and FloraGLO to vitamin and dietary supplement manufacturers, Kemin became a market-leader in lutein. The lutein model was adopted for other markets and Kemin demerged its second division, focused on developing patented molecules for the pharmaceutical industry, in 1997. Shortly thereafter, a new division serving the pet food industry was formed in 2000, and then another division serving the food industry was created in 2004. In 2004, Kemin purchased a manufacturing facility and administration building in Indaiatuba, Brazil to manage the company‚Äôs operations in South America.

The case established a precedent named the Moorov doctrine.  The Moorov doctrine  The essential facts of the case are where the accused was an employer who had allegedly committed a string of sexual offences regarding 19 of his female employees over the period of four years, with a total of 21 counts. There was corroboration of evidence available for 3 counts. This case brought light on the original course of similar fact evidence which was generally regarded as inadmissible in court. It created a \\"course of conduct\\" which related from a connection of special circumstances, such as recurring sexual offences, similar to the case itself. The course of conduct is sufficient as it determines the use of corroboration for each victim involved. Principles of the Moorov doctrine # Series of offences connected closely in \\"time, character and circumstance and have underlying unity.\\" # Evidence of one witness in a series of two or more separate offences capable of providing corroboration for the evidence of a witness in another case or cases. # Only evidence of the greater charge can corroborate the lesser charge, not vice versa # Not restricted to sexual assaults # The time factor can vary- usually not more than 3 years apart, however it may extend to this period in specific circumstances.Dodds v HMA # Character of the crime must be the same # Sodomy and rape are not the same crimes.P v HM Advocate, 1991 However, as children were involved Moorov applied # Incest and sodomy are not the same crimes.HM Advocate v Cox, 1962 Application of the doctrine * Distress * Prior to Lord Advocate‚Äôs Reference (No1 of 2001) to prove rape meant proving that intercourse happened against the will of the complainer. * Rape occurs when a man has intercourse with a woman without her consent * A victim's distressed state can corroborate rapeYates v HM Advocate, 1977 * New case law shows that distress is not necessarily enough corroboration, it is a matter of fact meaning it is up to the jury to decide if the distress is enough. Key cases where the Moorov doctrine was applied ;Yates v HM Advocate, 1977 * Accused of raping a 16-year-old girl * Only witness was a person who testified to the girl's distress shortly after the incident * Accused admitted intercourse, but said it was consensual * Found guilty ;Gracey v HM Advocate, 1987 * Gracey accused of rape * Gracey adamant victim was consensual * Convicted on basis of several witnesses testifying to her distressed state shortly after the incident ;Stobo v HM Advocate, 1994 * Indecent assault * Various witnesses testifying to victim‚Äôs distress * Found guilty even after appeal, it was circumstantial in the same way that torn clothing would be ;Smith v LeesSmith v Lees, 1997 JC 73 * Overruled Stobo * 13-year-old complained of a sexual assault while camping * Distress didn‚Äôt corroborate that the act had taken place * They corroborated that something had happened, however it could not be proven that the girl's distress was because of what was claimed to have happened in the tent. It is found that in incidents where intercourse is admitted and distress is proven, distress can corroborate. ;McKearney v HM Advocate, 2004 * Force is no longer part of definition of rape * Recent distress can‚Äôt prove the mens rea of the perpetrator * Distress may indicate lack of consent, but isn‚Äôt evidence that the man knew that/was reckless as to her consent ;Cullington v HM Advocate, 1999 * Sexual assault * Distress was enough to convict, as the jury didn‚Äôt believe Cullington‚Äôs version that it was consensual  Carloway Review  \\"It is acknowledged that the recommendation to remove the requirement for corroboration will attract particular comment and, no doubt, criticism. There may be further consequences of abolition that will need to be worked through, as the criminal justice system is progressively reformed. This is the nature of law in society. But the initial decision, which has to be taken, is whether, of itself, corroboration continues to contribute more than it detracts from a fair, efficient and effective system.\\"(para 7.0.5)  See also  *Rights of the Accused Pre-Trial Scotland  References  Scottish criminal case law 1930 in Scotland 1930 in case law 1930 in British law ","title":"Moorov v HM Advocate"},{"id":"20629925","text":"Human Markup Language (also HumanML and, within the context of a HumanML document, huml) is an XML specification developed to contextually describe physical, kinesic, cultural, and social information about instances of human communication.

The director of the department is the chief advisor to the Governor concerning issues affecting older Ohioans and policy changes at the federal Administration on Aging. History In 1966, Ohio established the Division of Administration on Aging, the predecessor to the Department of Aging, within the Department of Mental Hygiene and Corrections. On June 26, 1984, the Ohio Commission on Aging attained full departmental status and became the Ohio Department of Aging. Director Governor Mike Dewine appointed Ursel McElroy as his nominee to lead the Ohio Department of Aging on January 10, 2019. Mission and Programs The department's mission is to provide leadership for the delivery of services and supports that improve and promote quality of life and personal choice for older Ohioans, adults with disabilities, their families and their caregivers. Perhaps their best-known program is the popular Golden Buckeye program. The department administers Medicaid waiver programs that allow older adults on Medicaid to receive the care they need in settings other than nursing homes, such as the PASSPORT home care and Assisted Living Waiver programs. They also administer programs funded by the federal Older Americans Act, such as nutrition and transportation services for older adults, healthy lifestyle program, the civic engagement initiative and more. With a few exceptions, the department does not provide direct services to Ohioans. Rather, services are coordinated and managed by a network of 12 area agencies on aging. The area agencies screen potential clients, recruit service providers and more. The department monitors the area agencies for fiscal and program compliance.

It was sometimes referred to as the CMOS-PDP8. Since it was also produced by Harris Corporation, it was also known as the Harris HM-6100. The Intersil 6100 was introduced in the second quarter of 1975, and the Harris version in 1976. The 6100 family was produced using CMOS rather than the bipolar and NMOS technologies used by most of its contemporaries (Z80, 8080, 6502, 6800, 9900, etc.). As a result of its CMOS technology and low clock speeds, 8 MHz for the Harris HM-6100A, it had relatively low power consumption, less than 100 mW at 10 V/2 MHz, and could be operated from a single supply over the wide range of 4‚Äì11 V. Thus, it could be used in high reliability embedded systems without the need for any significant thermal management, if the rest of the system was also CMOS. The 6100 was available to military specification, and since it was dual sourced by Intersil and Harris, it was used in some military products as a low power alternative to the 8080, 6800 etc. Although it had a very simple instruction set and architecture, it was eminently suitable for use in embedded systems that had previously used discrete logic circuits and even Ledex motorised rotary switches or relay-based logic controllers. The 6100 family was used in a number of commercial products, including the DECmate line, DEC's first attempt to produce a personal computer. Intersil sold the integrated circuits commercially through 1982 as the IM6100 family. It was not priced competitively, and the offering failed. The IBM PCs in 1981 cemented the doom of the \\"CMOS-8s\\". Description Die of Intersil 6100. The 6100 is a 12-bit CPU that closely emulates the PDP-8 (See PDP-8 for a more complete discussion). It has three primary registers: PC (program counter), 12-bit AC (accumulator), and MQ (Multiplier Quotient). All two-operand instructions read the AC and MQ and write back to the AC. There is no stack pointer; subroutines return to their callers by jumping back into the main code, typically by storing the return address in the first word of the subroutine itself. (Not good for programs in ROM.) Conditionals in the 6100 allow only the next instruction to be skipped. Branches are constructed with a conditional and a following jump. There is only one maskable interrupt. When the interrupt is tripped, the CPU stores the current PC in 0000, and then starts executing from 0001. The interrupt can be disabled or enabled using the IOF and ION (or SKON) instructions. The 6100 has a 12-bit data/address bus, limiting RAM to only 4K words (6 KB). Memory references are 7-bit, offset either from address 0, or from the PC page base address (obtained by setting the seven least significant bits of PC to zero). Memory could be expanded using the optional 6102 support chip, which added three address lines and thus expanded memory to 32K words (48 KB) in the same way that the PDP-8/E expanded the PDP-8. The 6102 has two internal registers, IFR (instruction field register) and DFR (data field register), that offset the 4K page when the CPU accesses memory. Versions and supporting hardware Intersil offered a variety of related chipsIntersil, Data Book 1981, pages 8-77 to 8-211. to support 6100 systems. The IM6100 CPU implements a straight-8 (basic PDP-8 without memory mapping hardware). The IM6101 PIE (Programmable Interface Element) is a basic PDP-8 I/O port. The IM6102 MEDIC (Memory Extension, DMA Controller, Interval Timer) converts an IM6100 into something resembling a PDP-8/E's CPU. The IM6103 PIO (Parallel Input-Output Port), and the IM6402 or IM6403 UART are basic PDP-8 I/O devices on ICs. Intersil also offered compatible sizes of RAM and ROM: the IM6551 and IM6561 (1 Kbit, 256√ó4) SRAM, the IM6512 (768 Bit, 64x12) SRAM, and the IM6312 (12 Kbit, 1024√ó12) mask programmable PROM. A selection of these components were offered as the Intersil 6801 CMOS Family Sampler Kit with the 6960 ‚Äì Sampler PC Board, a single-board system including the IM6100 CPU, IM6101 PIE, the IM6312 ODT (Octal Debugging Technique) Monitor ROM, three 256√ó4 CMOS RAMs and a UART IM6403. The basic 6100 was later upgraded to the 6120, with the 6102 memory controller built-in.

Retrieved 10 December 2008. He is remembered as one of Denmark's most important 20th-century artists both for his portraits and landscapes. Life and development Giersing, who died at the early age of 45, was driven by a desire to concentrate on change and beauty. Unable to find support in religion, he adopted modernism as an existential approach as to how art could fill the void for those without faith in God. While some synergies with the work of Vilhelm Lundstr√∏m can be detected, he differed from contemporaries such as Niels Larsen Stevns, Sigurd Swane and Edvard Weie in that he sought to represent images just as he had seen them, almost in the form of photographs.English summary of the book GIERSING - Maler. Kritiker. Menneske by Lennart Gottlieb. Retrieved 10 December 2008. When he arrived in Paris in 1906, he was immediately taken by Gauguin but within a year it was √âdouard Manet who became his ideal, soon to be followed by C√©zanne and also the neo-impressionist Paul Signac. By 1907, he had begun to show interest in the Fauvists, including Derain, Othon Friesz, Manguin, Marquet and Puy and especially Braque. All this experience helped him to attain his own way of thinking, although he was ever wary of becoming \\"complete\\" as he believed it would inhibit his further development as an artist. He soon adopted a heavy, rather rough style with rough colours, partly inspired by Ernst Ludvig Kirchner. His painting The Judgment of Paris (1909) presents three female figures with broad dark blue outlines and rather confusing proportions. After a period during which he concentrated on portraits and on the female figure, from about 1912 he took a special interest in painting forests. He developed a wilder, more spontaneous style using a palette knife rather than brush strokes as can be seen in his Forest Path Sor√∏ (1916), one of his many successful forest works. Open landscapes followed, especially the Fures√∏ pictures from 1918 on.  The Gr√∏nningen association In 1914, unhappy with the lack of success of Ung Dansk Kunst (Young Danish Art), Giersing formed a new association called Gr√∏nningen, in which he took a leading role. This provided him with a basis for contributing to the early issues of a young artists' new periodical \\"Klingen\\". He was soon recognised as the authority answering those who refused to accept new ideas, encouraging his disciples to fight and endure. Football and ballet Sofus Heading, 1917 For many years, Giersing had taken a special interest in painting football scenes. However, it was not until 1917 that he adapted his approach to a rather aggressive and dynamic cubist interpretation as can be seen in Sofus Heading from 1917. The football paintings, like his ballet scenes, were based on photographs as starting points. In these vivid pictures, the dancers have no eyes or their faces are covered by masks. The final years In 1917, as he was becoming increasingly successful and more widely recognised as the leader of Denmark's younger painters, he married Besse Syberg, one of his students, who also became his favourite model. Soon afterwards, Besse's father Fritz Syberg gave her a small cottage at Svanninge in the south of Funen where Giersing spend several summers painting some 40 pictures. Here the landscapes became constructed pictures where the countryside was expressed in a few lush green colours. Another favourite motif of the period was the churchyard near Svanninge church. For Giersing, the 1920s did not bring the level of success he might have hoped for. After the war, Copenhagen lost many of its attractions for artists who moved to other parts of Europe. At the 1922 Gr√∏nningen exhibition in Copenhagen, Giersing exhibited almost exclusively black and grey pictures such as the Three Ladies in Black (1919), surprisingly attracting far more positive reviews. Finally, in his latter years he returned to more colourful still lifes. He died of pneumonia on 15 January 1927. Gallery Image:Harald Giersing , Skovinteri√∏r.

UNU- WIDER, the first research and training centre to be established by the UNU, is an international academic organization set up with the aim of promoting peace and progress by bringing together leading scholars from around the world to tackle pressing global problems. UNU-WIDER =The establishment of the UNU and UNU-WIDER= In 1969 the UN Secretary General U Thant suggested that the time had arrived when serious consideration might be given to establishing an international university. An international university, the Secretary-General said, would be devoted to the Charter objectives of peace and progress. It would be staffed with professors from many nations and all parts of the world. The university would thus serve to break down the barriers that created misunderstanding and mistrust between nations and cultures. The UNU was established by the General Assembly on 6 December 1973 to be an international community of scholars engaged in research, advanced training, and the dissemination of knowledge related to the pressing global problems of human survival, development, and welfare. The UNU started its activities in 1975 at its headquarters in Tokyo. The UNU established UNU-WIDER following a brainstorming of leading economists of the day outlining the need for an institution to undertake a sustained effort for a more comprehensive understanding of the forces at work in the global economic system and their consequences for specific developing country situations and at the international level In November 1983 Finland offered to host UNU-WIDER in its capital Helsinki, providing premises for the Institute and an endowment fund of US$25 million. UNU-WIDER was founded by a Host Country Agreement and Memorandum of Understanding signed by the then Foreign Minister of Finland, Paavo V√§yrynen, and the Rector of UNU, Soedjatmoko, on the 4th of February 1984. =Mandate= UNU-WIDER's mandate is to undertake multidisciplinary research and policy analysis on structural changes affecting the living conditions of the world's poorest people; provide a forum for professional interaction and advocacy of policies leading to equitable and environmentally sustainable growth; and train researchers and government officials in the field of economic and social policy making. =History= Following the approval by the Finnish Parliament, the Host Country Agreement came into force on 20 June 1984. Lal Jayawardena was appointed the inaugural director the 1st of March in 1985, and the institute was initially located at premises at Annankatu 42C in Helsinki, Finland. Research During its existence UNU- WIDER has produced a large amount of research on the broad topics of poverty, inequality and growth. The Research Programme changes every two years. It is constructed by the Director in consultation with the UNU-WIDER Board following extensive discussions with UNU-WIDER research staff, leading economists, and donor government representatives. Areas of research have spanned all facets and levels of development economics including topics like; Finance and trade; economic growth and the environment; women and development; international migration and refugees; micro-simulation of tax benefit reforms; social impact of privatization; fiscal policies for growth; transition and institutions; development aid; global trends in inequality and poverty; personal assets from a global perspective and many more. During the mid-1980s the Horn of Africa was confronting widespread famine. As this coincided with the launch of the very first UNU-WIDER research programme, the theme of ‚ÄúHunger and Poverty: The Poorest Billion‚Äù was included in it. This research was directed by Jean Dr√®ze and Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen. It has been argued that the resulting three volumes of study transformed the thinking on issues of famine and food security at the time. In the late 1990s WIDER undertook a major study of income inequality trends throughout the world under the direction of its then director Giovanni Andrea Cornia. The study uncovered so called ‚Äúnew causes‚Äù of inequality linked to excessively liberal economic policies and the way in which economic reforms have been implemented. Furthermore, the study produced the first version of the World Income Inequality Databasehttp://www.wider.unu.edu/research/Database/en_GB/database/ (WIID). It is a comprehensive and freely available database of statistics on inequality trends within countries. Since 2009, under director Finn Tarp, UNU-WIDER has concentrated widely on the ‚Äútriple crisis‚Äù of food, climate change and finance.

Mirrlees (1996) Controversy During the late 1980s and early 1990s the press reported on various financial and organisational irregularities about UNU-WIDER and its management.Sainio, Pentti: Operaatio Ahtisaari. Art House, 1993Helsingin Sanomat, monthly supplement, 1993 February 6Vihre√§ Lanka (22.4.1993, issue 15, pp. 9-11) =Institutional framework= The Council of UNU determines the principles and policies guiding the whole university. The Board of UNU-WIDER, comprising well-known economists, policy-makers, and social scientists from all over the world, advises on research and other activities. The Director of UNU-WIDER has overall responsibility for the research and management of the Institute, and implements the research programme in keeping with guidelines set out by the Board and the Council. UNU functions as a decentralized 'network of networks' with an interdisciplinary and global perspective. The UNU system comprises the UNU Centre in Tokyo and a worldwide network of Research and Training Centres and Programmes (RTC/Ps) assisted by numerous associated and cooperating institutions. =Organization= Research is coordinated by Helsinki-based staff consisting of resident researchers and support staff. A network of external project directors, located at their universities or institutes, contribute to current projects along with several hundred network participants around the world. This group includes research staff from the UNU, UN, ECLAC, UNDP, FAO, International Labour Organization, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), UNICEF and the Bretton Woods institutions including the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Visiting scholars typically spend two to three months in Helsinki working on topics related to the current research programme. The internship programme allows PhD students in economics or related social sciences to spend two to three months at UNU- WIDER. Funding UNU-WIDER was founded with contributions from the governments of Finland and India, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida), and the Nippon Foundation (Sasakawa Foundation, Japan). Income from the endowment fund has largely covered core expenditures. Supplementary financial support for research and other activities has been received from the governments of Denmark, Finland, Italy, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom; the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development( Kuwait), Ford Foundation, Yrj√∂ Jahnsson Foundation (Finland), MacArthur Foundation, Oracle (Finland), Rockefeller Foundation, SITRA (Finnish National Fund for Research and Development), United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN-DESA), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the World Bank. In-kind contributions, such as assistance in hosting workshops and conferences, are also regularly received from various universities, United Nations agencies and other international organizations. =Directors= *Kunal Sen (2019-incumbent) () *Finn Tarp (2009-2018) () *Anthony Shorrocks (2001-2009) () * Matti Pohjola (2000) acting.

Research projects are led by scholars (Research Fellows and External Project Directors) who elaborate the proposals before the projects are launched. Each project typically invites selected authors to write original research papers which are later presented and discussed at project workshops and conferences. In some cases, a more general 'call for papers' may be announced on the Institute's website. Typically, two large development conferences are organized annually in Helsinki, each of which brings together around 100 individuals to present papers and to discuss current problems on development issues. Participants are usually researchers and policy makers from the academic, government, and development communities. Special attempts are made to encourage researchers from developing countries and to achieve a gender balance at these events. The research studies are published as WIDER working papers. The outcomes also often include a policy brief and an article in the WIDERAngle. =Annual lecture= The WIDER Annual Lecture is delivered by an eminent scholar who has made a significant contribution in the field of economics of development and transition. 2013 Martti Ahtisaari - Egalitarian principles ‚Äì the foundation for sustainable peace 2012 Lant Pritchett - Folk and the Formula: Fact and Fiction in Development 2011 Justin Yifu Lin - From Flying Geese to Leading Dragons: New Opportunities and Strategies for Structural Transformation in Developing Countries 2010 Jos√© Antonio Ocampo - Reforming the International Monetary System 2009 Ronald Findlay - The Trade- Development Nexus in Theory and History 2009 Deepak Nayyar - Developing Countries in the World Economy: The Future in the Past? 2008 Kemal Dervi≈ü - The Climate Change Challenge 2006 Angus Deaton - Global Patterns of Income and Health: Facts, Interpretations, and Policies 2005 Nancy Birdsall - The World is not Flat: Inequality and Injustice in our Global Economy 2004 Dani Rodrik - Rethinking Growth Strategies 2003 Kaushik Basu - Global Labour Standards and Local Freedoms 2002 Jeffrey G.

The weapon was produced in the early 1960s and all stocks of U.S. BZ were destroyed by 1989. History The United States Army re-evaluated its chemical and biological weapons programs in 1961. This re-evaluation led to a renewed focus on an incapacitating agent program. A project was established to begin producing BZ munitions; one result was the mass production of the Chemical Corps' M43 BZ cluster bomb in March 1962.Smart, Jeffery K.

Though M43s and another BZ weapon, the M44 generator cluster, were produced, they were never really considered an integral part of the U.S. chemical arsenal. In the end around 1,500 BZ munitions were produced between the M43 and the M44.Davison, Neil. \\"'Off the Rocker' and 'On the Floor': The Continued Development of Biochemical Incapacitating Weapons \\", Bradford Science and Technology Report No. 8, Department of Peace Studies, University of Bradford (UK), August 2007, p. 5, accessed December 10, 2008. Specifications The M43 BZ cluster bomb had a diameter and a length. This cluster bomb was designed to hold three stacks of 19 M138 bomblets. The bomblets each held about of the incapacitating agent BZ, also known as 3-Quinuclidinyl benzilate.Mauroni, Albert J. Chemical Demilitarization: Public Policy Aspects, (Google Books), Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003, p. 19, (). The M43 was meant to be delivered from a subsonic aircraft and used a standard cluster adapter which would have tail fairing added to adapt it for high speeds. The M43 cluster bomb was intended to cover an area of about with BZ agent, which made it useful for attacking a squad or company sized element. A weapon such as the M43 would have been best used against hard, high-value intelligence targets, in hostage or prisoner rescue situations, or in any other situation where friendly forces and enemy forces occupied the same area.Kirby, Reid. \\"Paradise Lost: The Psycho Agents\\", The CBW Conventions Bulletin, May 2006, Issue no. 71, pp. 2‚Äì3, accessed December 10, 2008. If the M43 had been used in open terrain under neutral atmospheric stability it could have potentially incapacitated about 94% of the target with a fatality rate no greater than 2%. This would have been for a delayed (3 to 6 hour onset) and relatively long- term (1 to 5 days) neutralization.* Issues The M43 never rose above the status of \\"interim weapon\\" due to a number of shortcomings and issues with both the agent and the delivery system. BZ was expensive and difficult to synthesize, and this expense made large-area use of BZ impractical. Agent manufacture presented its own set of problems. BZ was susceptible to accidental ignition on the production line. The weaponization of BZ presented other problems including the agent cloud's easy visibility, and simple counter-measures (such as a few layers of cloth over the mouth and nose) could defeat it. In addition, the agent's \\"envelope-of-action\\" and rate of action were of questionable effectiveness. Between 50% and 80% of BZ casualties had to be restrained during recovery to prevent self-injury; other common symptoms during recovery were paranoia and mania. The combination of these issues made BZ weapons, the M43 and M44 generator cluster, unattractive to military planners. Storage and disposal programs All BZ agent and munitions produced were shipped to and stored at Pine Bluff Arsenal in Arkansas. The stored BZ agent and munitions were destroyed between December 1988 and 1989, with nearly all of them being destroyed by mid-December 1988.Bobrick, Michael C. \\"A Reasoned Response to NIMBY Opposition to Incineration of Chemical Weapon Stockpiles\\", (PDF p. 41, cache p. 36), Thesis, United States Army Judge Advocate General's School, April 1993, accessed December 10, 2008.

In 2018, he was hired as the head coach of the Colorado Eagles in the American Hockey League by their NHL affiliate, the Colorado Avalanche. Coaching career Cronin began his career as an assistant coach at his alma mater, Colby College in 1987‚Äì88 and then became a graduate assistant at the University of Maine from 1988 to 1990, then as an assistant for Colorado College from 1990 to 1993. He returned to Maine to be an assistant coach from 1993 to 1995 and was named interim head coach following a scandal that banished head coach Shawn Walsh from the bench for one year in 1995‚Äì96, leading the Black Bears to the Hockey East championship game in 1996 where they lost to Providence College, 3‚Äì2. Cronin spent time working with USA Hockey before joining the New York Islanders in 1998. He served as an assistant coach with the Islanders for 5 seasons before being named head coach of their minor league affiliate, the Bridgeport Sound Tigers. He coached the Sound Tigers for 2 seasons with great success, going 78‚Äì61‚Äì16‚Äì5. On June 16, 2014, Greg Cronin was named assistant coach of the New York Islanders. =Northeastern career= In 2005 Cronin replaced Bruce Crowder as head coach of the Northeastern Huskies men's hockey team. Cronin inherited a team that graduated almost all of their key players from a 15‚Äì18‚Äì5 team and had little hope of competing in the short term. The team went 3‚Äì24‚Äì7 in 2005‚Äì06 before posting a 13‚Äì18‚Äì5 record the following year behind the development of many of Cronin's recruits. The team further improved to 16‚Äì18‚Äì3 in 2007‚Äì08, winning their first playoff game in years in the 2‚Äì1 series loss to the University of Vermont. The Huskies opened the 2008‚Äì09 season expected to contend for home ice advantage in Hockey East (4th place or better) for the first time since 1997‚Äì98. The Huskies went 23‚Äì9‚Äì4 in the regular season, leading the conference until the final day when they lost at Boston College 4‚Äì1, falling to second place in Hockey East in the process. Season highlights included Northeastern's first sweep of Maine in 25 years, a win over Boston College in the Beanpot for the first time since 1994, and winning 2 of 3 games against both of the previous season's Hockey East Finalists, Vermont and Boston College. The Huskies opened the postseason by defeating the University of Massachusetts Amherst in the Hockey East Quarterfinals at Matthews Arena, 2 games to 1, with the 3rd game being won in overtime on a goal by freshman Alex Tuckerman. On February 18, 2011, Northeastern announced Cronin would be suspended indefinitely due to possible recruitment violations. The suspension lasted six games, with Cronin being reinstated prior to Northeastern's quarterfinal playoff series with Boston University. Northeastern would win that series, capturing two of three games at Agganis Arena and make it to the Hockey East semifinals for the second time in three years, where they fell to Boston College. On June 16, 2014, Cronin was named an assistant coach to the New York Islanders, after serving three years as an assistant to the Toronto Maple Leafs. Personal Cronin lives in Boston, and he has many family connections at Northeastern. His father, Don, and his uncle, Jerry, both played hockey for the Huskies in the 1950s and 1960s, and his cousin Kerry played for the women's teams from 1983‚Äì86, winning three Beanpots.

These destroyers (Italian: cacciatorpediniere) also varied in size from enlarged torpedo-boats to esploratori (an Italian designation for large destroyers approaching light cruiser size). During the war, Italian destroyers were responsible for the safe flow of convoys to supply the Axis armies in North Africa and for the suppression of British submarines. 71 Italian destroyers served during World War II (including those captured from Yugoslavia and France). 43 of these were sunk during the war against the Allies. After Italy surrendered to the Allies, a further 15 destroyers were sunk by the Germans or scuttled to prevent capture. 13 destroyers survived the war, most of which were ceded to France and the Soviet Union. 5 were retained by the postwar Marina Militare. Design evolution The operational areas for the Regia Marina (Royal Italian Navy) were expected to be enclosed seas such as the Mediterranean, Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. This was reflected in the design and construction of its warships, which did not need to withstand open ocean conditions. In 1941, the appropriately named Scirocco foundered in a storm off Cape Spartivento. Italian destroyer designs followed differing design paths. At one end, a torpedo boat design was developed into a series of destroyer classes (Sella, Sauro and Turbine) that were comparable with their British contemporaries. There were also large destroyers of the older Mirabello and Leone classes, which were reserved for less-dangerous tasks. The large destroyer concept had been revived in the mid-1920s, in response to new French designs. At the end of the 1920s, a design emerged (Freccia class) that was the basis for improvement and standardisation. Subsequent classes showed incremental changes that improved reliability and the Maestrales were the template for the following twenty-three ships. The original anti-aircraft weaponry, consisting of mixtures of obsolete 40-millimetre Vickers cannon (designed in 1917) and 13.2 mm machine guns was clearly inadequate when Italy entered World War II. The chosen answer was 20-millimetre cannon and, in some individual ships, 37-millimetre guns replaced torpedo tubes. The maximum speeds of Italian warships of this period should be viewed with caution, since Italian practice was to run the trials with ships as light as possible, often without armament. This enabled impressive speeds which were unobtainable under operational conditions.Whitley, p.157 =Esploratori= The designation esploratori, meaning \\"scouts\\", was originally given to a class of Italian warship that was between the then-current destroyers and cruisers, in terms of size and firepower. Of the Italian destroyers that saw action in World War II, the ships belonging to the Navigatori, Mirabello and Leone classes were originally rated as esploratori. They were reclassified as destroyers by 1940. The Regia Marina initially classified yet another group of ships (Capitani Romani class) as esploratori oceanici‚Äîocean scouts‚Äîbut they were later reclassified as light cruisers. Active service during World War II Italian destroyers were usually organised into Squadriglie (Destroyer Squadrons or Divisions) of four ships of one class. When Italy entered World War II, on 10 June 1940, the Regia Marina had sixteen Squadriglie Cacciatorpediniere. Destroyer Divisions 1 and 2 were each composed of four Turbine-class destroyers, Destroyer Division 3 (stationed in the Red Sea) consisted of the four Sauro-class destroyers, Destroyer Division 4 consisted of the two remaining Sella-class destroyers, Destroyer Division 5 (stationed in the Red Sea) was made of the three Leone-class destroyers, Destroyer Division 6 consisted of the two Mirabello-class destroyers, Destroyer Divisions 7, 8, 9 and 10 consisted of four ships each from the Freccia (Division 7), Folgore (Division 8), Oriani (Division 9) and Maestrale (Division 10) classes, respectively; Destroyer Divisions 11, 12 and 13 were composed of four Soldati- class destroyers each, and Destroyer Divisions 14, 15 and 16 were made of four Navigatori-class destroyers each. During the war, the older destroyers (such as the WWI-era Mirabello-class and the Sella-class, built in the early 1920s) were mainly used as escort ships on the less-dangerous routes (mainly between Italy, Albania, Greece, the Italian Dodecanese and the Axis-occupied islands in the Aegean Sea), whereas the more modern destroyers of the Oriani and Soldati classes were primarily employed as fleet escorts, but not exclusively so, taking part in most battles and operations that involved the Italian battle fleet between 1940 and 1942.Giorgio Giorgerini, La guerra italiana sul mare. La Marina tra vittoria e sconfitta 1940‚Äì1943, p. 426. Other tasks included mine-laying, convoy escort, anti-submarine, supply transport and anti-shipping. Destroyers that fell between the two categories, being neither too obsolete, nor modern enough for use with the battle fleet, were tasked with escorting supply convoys between Italy and North Africa; ships of the Navigatori, Freccia, Folgore and Maestrale classes were among those that saw most-intense service on these routes.Giorgio Giorgerini, La guerra italiana sul mare. La Marina tra vittoria e sconfitta 1940‚Äì1943, p. 426. As losses among the less-recent destroyers mounted, modern ones were increasingly used for convoy escort as well, and by late 1942 the majority of the Oriani and Soldati-class ships were also being primarily used for escort, transport and minelaying duties in the Sicilian Channel, leaving few destroyers with the battle fleet. During the Tunisian Campaign, after the Battle of Skerki Bank caused the loss of 1,500 soldiers in one night and showed that troop transports were too vulnerable to the Allied offensive, Italian destroyers were extensively used in fast troop-transport missions to Tunisia. Sailing from ports in Sicily, a destroyer division could deliver some 1,200 troops with their personal equipment in one night; of 77,741 troops sent to Tunisia by sea between November 1942 and May 1943, some 52,000 were carried by the destroyers, with the loss of less than 700 men (compared to nearly 5,000 troops lost at sea while being carried by merchant ships).Giuseppe Fioravanzo, La Marina italiana nella seconda guerra mondiale. Vol. VIII: La difesa del traffico con l'Africa Settentrionale dal 1¬∞ ottobre 1942 alla caduta della Tunisia, page 45. At the same time, Italian destroyers were deeply involved in escort missions of supply convoys and minelaying missions aimed at defending the main shipping lanes between Italy and Tunisia; during the Tunisian campaign, Italian destroyers carried out 535 escort missions, 301 transport missions and 132 minelaying missions (laying 4,093 mines overall).Giuseppe Fioravanzo, La Marina italiana nella seconda guerra mondiale. Vol. VIII: La difesa del traffico con l'Africa Settentrionale dal 1¬∞ ottobre 1942 alla caduta della Tunisia, page 59. At the outbreak of World War II, the Italian Navy had 59 destroyers (not including 67 \\"torpedo boats\\" that were either downrated WWI-era small destroyers, such as the Pilo, Sirtori, La Masa, Palestro and Curtatone classes, or ships of the Spica and Pegaso classes, comparable in size, armament and use to the Allied destroyer escorts). Twelve additional destroyers were commissioned during the war: five were newly built ships of the Soldati class and seven were captured foreign ships, of which three were Yugoslav ships captured in April 1941 with the Invasion of Yugoslavia, and four were French ships raised and repaired after the scuttling of the French fleet in Toulon in November 1942\\\\. The intense service of these ships, especially on the dangerous supply routes between Italy and North Africa, resulted in severe losses: of seventy-one Italian destroyers that served during World War II, forty-tree were sunk during the war against the Allies, between 10 June 1940 and 8 September 1943, and another fifteen were lost following the Armistice of Cassibile and Operation Achse (most of the latter were undergoing maintenance or repairs when the armistice was declared, and were scuttled in harbour to prevent them from falling into German hands). Most of the thirteen destroyers that survived the war were ceded to France and the Soviet Union by order of the Paris Peace Treaty; only five destroyers (the WWI-era Augusto Riboty, the Navigatori-class Nicoloso Da Recco and the more modern Grecale, Granatiere and Carabiniere) were left to the postwar Marina Militare. Of the fifty-eight Italian destroyers lost during World War II, fourteen were sunk by aircraft, ten by surface warships, eight by submarines, six by mines, five by accidental causes, and one by motor torpedo boats. Eight were scuttled and six captured, most of them in harbour while undergoing repairs, following the Italian armistice and the German occupation of Italy. Classes At the Italian declaration of war in June 1940, the Regia Marina's destroyer force was a mix of outdated ships of World War I design and larger numbers of modern designs. =Mirabello class= Three destroyers were commissioned in 1916‚Äì1917 as esploratori, but one (Carlo Alberto Racchia) was lost in the Black Sea in 1920. The ships of this class were powerful destroyers in the early 1920s, displacing 2,300 tonsUnless otherwise stated, all displacements are given in metric tonnes as full displacement. and armed with eight four-inch guns in single mounts, 450-millimetre (17.7 in) torpedoes, depth charges and mines. Four of the eight guns were mounted along the ships' sides, reducing a broadside to six.Whitley, p.158 The Mirabellos reflected their age when Italy entered the war, and were used to lay minefields off Taranto and to escort convoys to Albania and Greece, relatively \\"safe\\" duties. Despite this, Carlo Mirabello was mined and sank off the Greek coast near Cape Dukato in 1941. During 1942‚Äì43, the remaining ship, Augusto Ributy, was rearmed to escort convoyes, removing its four beam four-inch guns and strengthening its anti-aircraft weaponry to eight 20-millimetre machine guns while increasing depth charge capacity. She survived the war and, though assigned to the Soviet Union by the peace treaty, she was refused due to her old age and was scrapped in 1951. =Leone class= Three \\"esploratori\\" were commissioned in 1924, and were reclassified as destroyers in 1938. Their armament was upgraded from that of the preceding Mirabellos and the resultant additional topweight required increases in dimensions and displacement (2,690 tonnes) with the machinery significantly uprated to maintain speed. Main guns and torpedoes were all located along the centre-line, an improvement that allowed all guns to fire to both sides, although two turrets were placed amidships and could fire to either side. Eight 4.7-inch guns (120 mm ‚Äì the new standard for Italian destroyers, introduced during World War I by the Romanian-ordered Aquila class)Robert Gardiner, Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1906‚Äì1921, Naval Institute Press, 1985, p. 266 were mounted in four twin turrets and torpedo tubes were now 21 inch. All three were part of the Italian Red Sea Flotilla when Italy entered the war in June 1940, where they were employed to lay mine fields and to disrupt British convoys, without any success. All were lost by early April 1941\\\\. Leone ran aground and was sunk by her sisters. After an abortive mission against Port Sudan, Pantera and Tigre, both damaged by Swordfish aircraft, were scuttled off Saudi Arabia.Whitley, pp.158‚Äì159Jackson, p.283 =Sella class= The four ships were enlarged Palestro class torpedo boats, commissioned in 1926 and 1927, displacing 1,500 tonnes. As completed, these ships had a single 120-millimetre (4.7 inch) gun, four 533-millimetre (21 inch) torpedo tubes, two 40 mm and two 13.2 mm machine guns. The single 120 mm gun mounting was changed to a twin in 1929 and an additional twin mount was installed sometime before 1942. The 40 mm weapons were an old pattern and they were replaced by two 20 mm. Two more 20 mm and two depth charge throwers were added. In use, the class proved to be unreliable.Whitley, p.160 Two of this class, Bettino Ricasoli and Giovanni Nicotera, were sold to Sweden and transferred just as Italy declared war. The remaining two were stationed in the Aegean for much of the war. They laid minefields and escorted convoys and were involved in actions against British operations off Rhodes and Crete. In the latter case they carried the explosive motorboats that seriously damaged HMS York at Suda Bay. At the Italian surrender in 1943, German E-Boats sank the Quintino Sella, while Francesco Crispi was captured in Piraeus and renamed TA15 for the Kriegsmarine, later sunk by Allied planes on 12 October 1944. =Sauro class= Four destroyers were commissioned in 1926 and 1927. They were developments of the preceding Sella class, with a broader beam to allow for the greater weight of weaponry and some layout changes. The machinery remained substantially unchanged and, consequentially, the Sauros were no more reliable. They displaced 1,625 tonnes, with four 120 mm guns and six 533 mm torpedo tubes. Secondary armament, 40 mm and 13.2 mm machine guns were unchanged at the time of their early loss.Whitley, pp.160‚Äì161 The four destroyers were based in the Red Sea to attack British convoys. All were lost by early April 1941, when Massawa fell: one (Francesco Nullo) was sunk by HMS Kimberley in October 1940 after a failed attack on a British convoy, while two (Nazario Sauro and Daniele Manin) were sunk by British planes during a last failed attack on Port Sudan, shortly before the fall of Massawa, and the last one (Cesare Battisti) had to be scuttled after engine defects forced her to abort the same mission. =Turbine class= Eight 1,700 tonne destroyers were commissioned in 1927 and 1928. These ships were a further development of the Sella design, with a larger hull, significantly increased engine power and fuel storage. The result was slightly faster ships with greater range. Armament was unchanged but a greater mine capacity was available. After 1940, the two surviving ships had their old model 40 mm guns replaced by modern 10 mm ones. In addition, Turbine had one triple torpedo tube mounting replaced by a 37 mm gun.Whitley, p.161 All of the class were based at Tobruk, Italian Libya, and used to lay minefields and run supplies from Italy. This was an exposed location and six were sunk before the end of September 1940, most in harbour by naval aircraft. Two survived until the Italian surrender, one (Turbine) was captured by the Germans and renamed TA14. Euro joined the Allies and was subsequently sunk off Leros. =Navigatori class= The twelve destroyers were commissioned between December 1929 and May 1931\\\\. They were a modern form of the earlier esploratori, displacing 2,650 tonnes, and were a response to the French Jaguar and Gu√©pard classes. Weaponry was reduced to six 120 mm guns in three twin turrets, one of which was amidships. The guns were a new model (Ansaldo 1926 pattern, 50 calibre) and the mountings allowed 45¬∞ elevation. The class used two sizes of torpedoes, in two triple banks, each unusually composed of two 533 mm (21 in) separated by one 450 mm (17.7 in) torpedo launcher. As originally built, the class retained the older anti-aircraft fit of two 40 mm and four 13.2 mm machine guns. Fifty-six mines were carried, except for the flagship, Nicolosso Da Rocco, which required space for staff facilities. The class's machinery introduced a unit design, whereby the boilers and engine for one shaft were housed separately from those for the other shaft. Power output was substantially increased in order to deliver the desired speed. A new style of bridge layout and structure was also introduced.Whitley, pp.162‚Äì164 As originally built, the Navigatori ships were insufficiently stable and too wet. Remedies were applied in two stages, firstly in the mid-1930s when some superficial changes were made to reduce superstructures and move fuel bunkers, and subsequently from 1938 to 1940, when the beam was increased and bows raised. This increased displacement and significantly reduced speed. During World War II, several programmes were started to upgrade weaponry, in particular anti-aircraft weapons, but none were applied uniformly to all ships in the class. These included full triple 533 mm torpedo mountings, 40 mm guns replaced by greater numbers of 20 mm guns, and replacement of the after torpedo tubes with 37 mm guns. Several ships were adapted for radar but only two received the equipment; Leone Pancaldo had the Italian EC3/ter Gufo set and Lanzaretto Malocello had the German FuMo 26/40G. The three squadrons of this class served in the Mediterranean, escorting North African convoys, laying offensive minefields, bombarding shore targets and screening the fleet. Five ships survived until the Italian surrender, but two of these were sunk in September 1943 after action against a German convoy and another was scuttled in port to avoid capture by the Germans. One was captured by the Germans and served with them as TA44. One ship survived the war in Italian service. =Freccia or Dardo class= The four destroyers, commissioned between October 1931 and May 1932, were a reversion to the smaller type of fleet destroyer and were intended to keep pace with the new Zara-class cruisers. Achieving such speeds required greater engine power. Despite their design origins with the Turbine class, various changes resulted in the displacement, as originally built, increasing to 2,150 tonnes. These changes included a larger hull, remodelled bridge, and engine exhausts trunked to a single funnel. Poor stability and engine reliability were serious problems when the ships entered service and remedies were attempted which, in turn, led to fuel contamination. Weaponry was the same as the Turbines, except that an improved version of the 120 mm gun was installed (Ansaldo 1926 pattern). Later, the obsolete 40 mm and 13.2 mm machine guns were replaced by 20 mm (65 calibre) machine guns. In one ship, a torpedo mounting was replaced by two 37 mm guns.Whitley, p.165 At Italy entered the war, the four ships formed the 7th Squadron based at Taranto and they were at the Battle of Calabria. Otherwise, their main role was convoy protection. Three were lost before the Italian surrender and one, Dardo, was captured by the Germans (renamed TA31). Four ships, the , were built for the Greek Navy, based on the Freccia design.Whitley, p.154 =Folgore class= The four destroyers, commissioned between June and September 1932, were modified Freccias and are sometimes included in that class as the \\"second group\\". Displacement was marginally reduced at 2,130 tonnes. The one major alteration was to reduce beam in order to improve their speed, which resulted in reduced fuel capacity and range. They were no more reliable or seaworthy than the Freccias. Their anti-aircraft gunnery was similarly improved.Whitley, p.166 These ships' service was closely similar to the Freccias. They were based at Taranto and also took part in the Battle of Calabria. They also spent much of their time escorting North African convoys, on which duties they were all lost before the Italian surrender. =Maestrale class= Development of the destroyers was a largely successful attempt to eliminate faults of the Dardo and Folgore classes. The four ships, commissioned from September to November 1934, were larger at 2,255 tonnes, longer and broader. Engines and armament, as completed, were unchanged from the Dardos, but a later version of the 120 mm gun was used, the O.T.O. Pattern 1931. During service, efforts were made to improve the potency of the anti-aircraft weaponry; 40 mm and 13.2 mm machine guns were replaced by newer 20 mm ones and subsequently increased in number, and two 37 mm anti-aircraft guns were installed in place of a torpedo-tube mounting. A 120 mm starshell gun was installed on some ships to mitigate the Italian Navy's disadvantages in night actions.Whitley, p.167 Although mainly used as fleet escorts, these ships also laid minefields and escorted convoys. During one such duty, they missed the Battle of Calabria and were never involved in a major fleet action. Two were lost before the Italian surrender: one torpedoed and one lost in a storm. Another, under repair at the surrender, was scuttled to avoid German capture. The fourth, Grecale, joined the Allies and was involved in actions against the Germans and survived into post-war Italian service. =Oriani or Poeti class= The four destroyers were commissioned between July and December 1937\\\\. They were effectively Maestrales with increased engine power, which provided only a marginal speed improvement. The obsolete 40 mm anti-aircraft guns were discontinued and replaced by extra 13.2 mm machine guns; otherwise armament was unchanged. The ships displaced 2,510 tonnes as built. Significant upgrades were made to the weapons systems of the two ships which survived the Battle of Cape Matapan, similar to those made to the Maestrales. One torpedo-tube mounting was replaced by two 37 mm guns; 20 mm cannon, a 120 mm star-shell gun and depth charge throwers were also installed. Before the end of the war, one ship, Oriani, had German Seetakt radar and additional 20 mm cannon.Whitley, p.168 The four Orianis operated as fleet escorts for much of the war, being present at the battles of Calabria and Matapan, two being sunk at the latter action. Another was sunk shortly before the Italian surrender. One ship, Oriani, survived to serve with the Allies and was subsequently transferred to France and renamed D'Estaing. =Soldati class= Nineteen destroyers were built in two batches: twelve commissioned between August 1938 and May 1939, and five between February and August 1942\\\\. The remaining two ships were not completed before the surrender; one was scrapped while under construction and the final one was completed under German colours.Whitley, pp.169‚Äì171 First group The first batch took the Oriani design, with some modifications giving an increased displacement of 1,645 tonnes. Weapons systems were modified but these were not consistent between all ships of the class. The 120 mm guns remained the main battery, in two twin mountings, fore and aft, but a later pattern was used, the 1936 or 1937 Ansaldo. As completed, the anti-aircraft battery consisted of twelve machine guns. Five ships are known to have had a second fire-control director installed aft; two ships are known not have been so fitted. All except Carabiniere had a 120 mm star shell gun amidships. All ships had two triple 21-inch torpedo-tube mountings.Whitley, pp.169‚Äì170 In 1940‚Äì1941, the second fire-control directors were removed from those ships that had them. Five ships had an additional single 120 mm gun (Ansaldo 1940 pattern) installed to replace their star-shell gun. The anti-aircraft machine-guns were replaced by 20 mm cannon and further strengthened in 1943. Three ships received two single 37 mm anti-aircraft guns, which replaced the single 120 mm (where installed) and the aft torpedo-tube mountings. One ship, Fuciliere, had an Italian Gufo radar set installed in 1943. Second group Seven modified Soldati-class ships were ordered in 1940 and laid down from late 1940 to 1941. These ships were equipped with five 120 mm guns (2 twin and one single replacing the star-shell gun of the earlier ships) and additional light AA guns. =Comandanti Medaglie d'Oro class= None of the were ever launched. Twenty were ordered for the Regia Marina and nine were laid down. =Captured ships= The Regia Marina also operated some destroyers built for foreign navies, captured from either France or Yugoslavia. * Premuda ‚Äì former Yugoslav destroyer Dubrovnik captured in April 1941 * Beograd class ‚Äì 2 former Yugoslav destroyers captured in April 1941 * FR 22 ‚Äì former French destroyer of the Chacal class captured in November 1942 * Gu√©pard class ‚Äì 2 former French destroyers captured in November 1942, FR 21 and FR 24 * FR 31 ‚Äì former French destroyer of the Bourrasque class captured in November 1942 Weapons systems =Guns= *4 inch (Mirabello) *120 millimetre (4.7 in) M1918/19 Pattern (Leone) *120 millimetre (4.7 in) O.T.O. 1926 Pattern (Sella, Sauro, Turbine) *120 millimetre (4.7 in), 50 calibre Ansaldo 1926 Pattern (Navigatore, Freccia, Folgore) *120 millimetre (4.7 in), 50 calibre O.T.O. 1931 Pattern (Maestrale) *120 millimetre (4.7 in), 1936 & 1937 Patterns (Soldati, 1st group) *120 millimetre (4.7 in), 50 calibre Ansaldo 1940 Pattern (some Soldati, 1st group) *120 millimetre (4.7 in), 15 calibre star-shell gun *Vickers 40 millimetre, 39 calibre (original fit for most classes, steadily replaced by 20mm/65 calibre) *Breda 37 millimetre, 54 calibre (Turbine, individual ships of Freccia, Folgore, Maestrale, Oriani, some Soldati) *Breda Model 35 20-millimetre, 65 calibre (Navigatori, Soldati) *Scotte-Isotta 20 millimetre, 70 calibre (Oriani, Soldati(?)) *Breda Model 1931 13.2 mm machine guns =Torpedoes= *450 millimetres (17.7 in) (Navigatori) *533 millimetres (21 in) (Navigatori, Soldati) =Depth charges= =Mines= =Radar= *EC3/ter Gufo *FuMo 26/40G *Seetakt Gallery File:Rct_Mirabello.jpgMirabello class File:Destroyer_Pantera.JPGLeone class File:Sella_at_anchor.jpgSella class File:Destroyer_Nazario_Sauro.jpgSauro class File:RIN_Nembo.jpgTurbine class File:Nicolo_Zeno_at_anchor.jpgNavigatori class File:RCT_Freccia_cartolina.jpgFreccia class or Dardo class File:Rn_fulmine.JPGFolgore class File:RM-Scirocco_at_anchor.jpgMaestrale class File:Oriani_and_her_crew.jpgOriani class or Poeti class File:Destroyer_Ascari.jpgBatch 1 Soldati class File:Mitragliere_1942_USMM.jpgBatch 2 Soldati class See also * List of Italian destroyers * Destroyer * Regia Marina Bibliography References External links * Italian Destroyers ","title":"Italian World War II destroyers"},{"id":"20630335","text":"Yuxarƒ± Seyf…ôli is a village and municipality in the Shamkir Rayon of Azerbaijan.

Bacteria in biofilm were first detected under the microscopes of Antony van Leeuwenhoek in the 17th century. Various bacteria and saliva are two of the major components in oral microbiology, having the capability to be harmful, but also performing beneficial and necessary roles in the immune system. Proper oral hygiene aims to control the harmful effects and prevent disease transmission.  Discovery and history  Bacteria were first detected under the microscopes of Antony van Leeuwenhoek in the 17th century. Leeuwenhoek, a Dutch scientist, performed many experiments testing and observing bacteria. He observed plaque on his own teeth‚Äî ‚Äúa little white matter‚Äù as he called it.University of California Museum of Paleontology Under microscopes he saw ‚Äúthat in the said matter there were many very little living animalcules, very prettily a-moving,‚Äù which was the first sighting of oral bacteria as we know it. Leeuwenhoek tested the mouths of others, as well as his own. Two men that he tested had never cleaned their teeth in their lives and Leeuwenhoek found ‚Äúan unbelievably great company of living animalcules‚Ä¶in such enormous numbers, that all the water ‚Ä¶ seemed to be alive.‚Äù Thus Leeuwenhoek discovered oral bacteria or ‚Äúanimalcules,‚Äù the name he gave bacteria in general.Slavkin, HC. \\"Biofilms, Microbial Ecology and Antoni Van Leeuwenhoek.\\" Later studies have shown that he actually saw mats of bacteria, what we know today as biofilms. Biofilms are communities of bacteria, or micro-organisms, attached to surfaces in the body. Oral biofilms are more commonly referred to as plaque. Biofilms form almost everywhere bacteria are. In the mouth, they naturally form on any stationary surface, namely teeth, gums, and the tongue.Slavkin, HC. \\"Biofilms, Microbial Ecology and Antoni Van Leeuwenhoek.\\" Leeuwenhoek made important findings of bacteria with his first observation and analysis of dental plaque, and since then much more has been discovered about the mouth and its ecology.  Ecology and types  The human mouth contains around 500 to 1,000 different types of bacteria with various functions as part of the human flora and oral microbiology. About 100 to 200 species may live in them at any given time.How Microbes Defend and Define Us Individuals that practice oral hygiene have 1,000 to 100,000 bacteria living on each tooth surface, while less clean mouths can have between 100 million and 1 billion bacteria on each tooth.Stevens, Jane E., and Jack Desrocher. \\"Oral ecology.\\" While some of the bacteria in our mouths are harmful and can cause serious illness, much of our oral bacteria are actually beneficial in preventing disease. Streptococci make up a large part of oral bacteria.\\"Streptococcus mutans.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. There are four main species within streptococci: the mutans, salivarius, anginosus, and mitis groups. Streptococcus mutans make up a large majority of what affects our mouthsMarsh, Philip, and Michael V. Martin. Oral Microbiology. pg. 20 and create acids which may cause decay. The enzymes ‚Äúleach down the tooth and begin to dissolve the ligaments and bone that help to hold the teeth in your mouth.‚ÄùDentist Robert Gandola, interview By turning simple sugars and carbohydrates into acids and enzymes that dissolve tooth enamel, this bacteria can leave a person with lasting dental problems.\\"Streptococcus mutans.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. According to Dr. Robert Gandola, a dentist, ‚ÄúA number of bacteria can cause decay [and many] are suspected in periodontal (gum) disease.‚ÄùDentist Robert Gandola, email. Oral bacteria work with our immune system to keep our bodies disease free by fighting disease-producing germs that try to come in through the mouth. For example, some of these bacteria produce organic acids that kill the organisms that cause intestinal problems. Without these good bacteria, our immune systems would be constantly bombarded by airborne and saliva-transferred germs. Bacteria are also needed to control the growth of fungus. ‚ÄúBalance between all the different bacteria and fungus are critical‚Äù or else the ‚Äúfungus overgrows and takes over.‚Äù So, ironically, though bacteria have the potential to harm us, our mouth and the good bacteria in it are the body's first line of defense. These bacteria are transmitted to a human early in their childhood through their contact with their caretakers by kisses or food premastication.  Bacterial growth in the mouth/teeth  Numerous kinds of bacteria grow in the mouth. ‚ÄúThey are competing for food and places to grow‚Äù and the many hard surfaces in the mouth provide an ideal place for bacteria and biofilms to grow and reproduce. Unlike most other places in or on the body, the mouth does not desquamate (shed).Kuramitsu, Howard K., and Richard P. Ellen. Oral Bacterial Ecology; the Molecular Basis. A tooth's distinct surface and stagnant nature makes it optimal for populations and growth of micro-organisms and bacteria, resulting in dental plaque. To grow and flourish in the mouth, biofilms go through four main stages of growth. First, bacteria must be deposited from saliva onto a surface where it can attach. Then the bacteria, or micro-organisms, grow and replicate. Since bacteria can grow exponentially in short periods of time, it can quickly and easily create biofilms. Third, the biofilm matures and accumulates more mass on the surface. Bacteria can continue to divide and grow by binary fission until nutrients begin to run out or their growth is inhibited. When this happens there is the final stage, the dispersal or detachment, causing the death of the bacteria.Thomas, John G. and Lindsay A. Nakaishi. ‚ÄúManaging the Complexity of a Dynamic Biofilm.‚Äù Some oral bacteria, Streptococcus gordonii for example, cannot last for long periods without nutrients, while other types of bacteria can survive for weeks. While in their prime, biofilms can cause major damage to a person's teeth and gums. Though damaging, biofilms can be partly removed by brushing and flossing and ‚Äúsome of it comes off with rinsing or eating.‚Äù  Saliva  Saliva keeps the ecosystem of the mouth in balance. It contains its own bacterial enzymes that are beneficial to our health. An example of these are lysozomes. These antibacterial agents in saliva kill bacteria in our mouths and protect from potentially dangerous diseases.Kuramitsu, Howard K., and Richard P. Ellen. Oral Bacterial Ecology; the Molecular Basis In addition, saliva contains phosphate and calcium ions that help repair microscopic chinks made in the teeth by the bacteria's acid. The major organic constituents of saliva are proteins and glycoproteins. Proteins in saliva float around and influence the mouth's ecosystem in multiple ways. Some of the proteins provide nutrients for bacteria, while others cause bacteria to clump together so they are unable to stick to any surface and are washed away. The main function of saliva is to flush out all of the micro-organisms that could potentially threaten our health.Marsh, Philip, and Michael V. Martin. Oral Microbiology. The flow of saliva constantly bathes the mouth and detaches all micro-organisms that are not already firmly attached to a surface. This makes it difficult for bacteria to adhere to surfaces to even begin to form biofilms. Many harmful micro- organisms, therefore, are unable to attach quick enough to a surface before they are caught in saliva and swallowed.DePaola, Dominick P., Frederick A. Curro, and Domenick T. Zero. \\"Saliva: The Precious Body Fluid.\\" Although saliva does a lot to keep our bodies healthy, it cannot completely keep all bacteria from adhering to tooth, tongue or gum surfaces.  Diseases  = Diseases transmitted through saliva = Each day numerous bacteria grow in a person's mouth. Many diseases are related to oral bacteria. Proper oral care and habits often protect against and reduce the effects of some harmful bacteria. Because of the amount of bacteria in each person's mouth, there is a transfer of bacteria through saliva when lip balm, drinks, toothbrushes, or anything else is shared. Said bacteria transfer can lead to human illnesses. Some of these diseases that result are relatively inconsequential while others could potentially have a serious impact on one's life. Some examples of the milder diseases passed through saliva include: herpes simple virus (cold sores or canker sores), flu virus, cold virus, various bacteria that cause periodontal disease (inflammation or infection of gum tissue), venereal diseases, and candida albicans (fungus).Robert Gandola, email. Mononucleosis (mono), known among teenagers as the ‚Äúkissing disease‚Äù, is another prominent condition that can come from saliva exchange, although it is not caused by bacteria, it is a contagious viral disease in the herpes virus family. Mono can ‚Äúbe spread when a person coughs, sneezes, or shares objects such as drinking glass or water bottles.‚ÄùDreher, Nancy. \\"What you need to know about mono.\\" There are only certain stages when it is contagious, mostly during the fever stage, but during those times it is transferable through saliva exchange. = Diseases related to oral hygiene = Some serious and possibly life-threatening diseases have been found to be connected to oral hygiene. These diseases are not passed through saliva, but are still influenced by the mouth's ecology and bacteria. Streptococcus mutans, a common oral bacteria discussed above, is a pathogen that causes pneumonia, sinusitis, otitis media, and meningitis.  Prevention  Although disease is possible through oral interactions, there are many ways to prevent or reduce the risk of infection and disease. Brushing and flossing teeth regularly are the most basic ways to reduce these risks. These two hygiene tips help to get rid of bacteria that try to stick to surfaces in the mouth to form plaque (oral biofilms). Brushing and flossing the teeth disrupts biofilms and their ability to permanently damage the teeth or gums. The less one brushes their teeth, the better chance that bacteria will form plaque, which may potentially cause serious oral health issues.Favot, Christa. ‚ÄúWhat is Living in my Mouth? Biofilms, Carbohydrate, and Acid Blasts.‚Äù Diet has an influence in our oral health as well.‚ÄúAvoiding Tooth Decay.‚Äù Oral-B. Much of the bacteria in our mouths are nourished by simple sugars and carbohydrates. An excess of candy, soda, or other simple sugars is an easy way to let bacteria thrive in our mouths. Fluoride is extremely effective in protecting enamel on the teeth. ‚ÄúFluoride, a chemical that appears naturally in groundwater in many areas of the world, quickly bonds with the tooth's enamel to maintain its smooth crystalline surface and deter bacteria from gaining a toehold.‚Äù The Oral-B website advises people to ‚Äúdrink tap water when possible‚Äù because ‚Äúif bottled water is your main source of drinking water, you could be missing the decay-preventative benefits of fluoride.‚Äù‚ÄúAvoiding Tooth Decay.‚Äù Oral-B. Also, a study in the Journal of the American Dental Association states that ‚Äúantiseptic mouthwashes have been associated with a 28 to 34 percent reduction in dental plaque biofilms at six month follow-ups. Chlorhexidine gluconate [mouthwash] rinses, when combined with toothbrushing, have been reported to reduce oral biofilms . . . by 50 to 55 percent.‚Äù Going to a dentist can help people who have difficulty with oral hygiene learn how to begin these preventive measure, as well as determining what symptoms one's oral ecology may be causing.

Dr. Means had 110 slaves according to the 1850 Greene County census. The house was built in 1840. It was acquired by the Hays family in 1869 and renamed Myrtle Hall for the sweet myrtle growing around it. The property was restored in 2007 by the Beeker family and renamed Myrtle Hill. The house was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 19, 1982 due to its architectural significance.
