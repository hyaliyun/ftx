It consists of three highly homologous subtypes, including Œ±1A-, Œ±1B-, and Œ±1D-adrenergic. Catecholamines like norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and epinephrine (adrenaline) signal through the Œ±1-adrenergic receptor in the central and peripheral nervous systems. There is no Œ±1C receptor. At one time, there was a subtype known as Œ±1C, but it was found to be identical to the previously discovered Œ±1A receptor subtype. To avoid confusion, naming was continued with the letter D. Effects The Œ±1-adrenergic receptor has several general functions in common with the Œ±2-adrenergic receptor, but also has specific effects of its own. Œ±1-receptors primarily mediate smooth muscle contraction, but have important functions elsewhere as well. The neurotransmitter norepinephrine has higher affinity for the Œ±1 receptor than does the hormone epinephrine/adrenaline. =Smooth muscle= In smooth muscle cells of blood vessels the principal effect of activation of these receptors is vasoconstriction. Blood vessels with Œ±1-adrenergic receptors are present in the skin, the sphincters of gastrointestinal system, kidney (renal artery) and brain.Circulation & Lung Physiology I M.A.S.T.E.R. Learning Program, UC Davis School of Medicine During the fight-or-flight response vasoconstriction results in decreased blood flow to these organs. This accounts for the pale appearance of the skin of an individual when frightened. It also induces contraction of the urinary bladder, although this effect is minor compared to the relaxing effect of Œ≤2-adrenergic receptors. In other words, the overall effect of sympathetic stimuli on the bladder is relaxation, in order to inhibit micturition upon anticipation of a stressful event. Other effects on smooth muscle are contraction in: * Ureter * Uterus (when pregnant): this is minor compared to the relaxing effects of the Œ≤2 receptor, agonists of which - notably albuterol/salbutamol - were formerly used to inhibit premature labor. * Urethral sphincter * Bronchioles (although minor to the relaxing effect of Œ≤2 receptor on bronchioles) * Iris dilator muscle Page 163 * Seminal tract, resulting in ejaculation =Neuronal= Activation of Œ±1-adrenergic receptors produces anorexia and partially mediates the efficacy of appetite suppressants like phenylpropanolamine and amphetamine in the treatment of obesity. Norepinephrine has been shown to decrease cellular excitability in all layers of the temporal cortex, including the primary auditory cortex. In particular, norepinephrine decreases glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic potentials by the activation of Œ±1-adrenergic receptors. Norepinephrine also stimulates serotonin release by binding Œ±1-adrenergic receptors located on serotonergic neurons in the raphe. Stahl, S. M. (2008). Essential Psychopharmacology Online.

Signaling cascade Œ±1-Adrenergic receptors are members of the G protein- coupled receptor superfamily. Upon activation, a heterotrimeric G protein, Gq, activates phospholipase C (PLC), which causes phosphatidylinositol to be transformed into inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). While DAG stays near the membrane, IP3 diffuses into the cytosol and to find the IP3 receptor on the endoplasmic reticulum, triggering calcium release from the stores. This triggers further effects, primarily through the activation of an enzyme Protein Kinase C. This enzyme, as a kinase, functions by phosphorylation of other enzymes causing their activation, or by phosphorylation of certain channels leading to the increase or decrease of electrolyte transfer in or out of the cell. Activity during exercise During exercise, Œ±1-adrenergic receptors in active muscles are attenuated in an exercise intensity-dependent manner, allowing the Œ≤2-adrenergic receptors which mediate vasodilation to dominate. In contrast to Œ±2-adrenergic receptors, Œ±1-adrenergic-receptors in the arterial vasculature of skeletal muscle are more resistant to inhibition, and attenuation of Œ±1-adrenergic- receptor-mediated vasoconstriction only occurs during heavy exercise. Note that only active muscle Œ±1-adrenergic receptors will be blocked. Resting muscle will not have its Œ±1-adrenergic receptors blocked, and hence the overall effect will be Œ±1-adrenergic-mediated vasoconstriction.

History The magazine was founded in September 1983, from an office on the Earls Court Road by two British Iraqi brothers, Ali and Ghadir Razuki. Their family left Iraq for the UK in 1968 when Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath Party, then led by Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, came to power. They regularly socialised with Australians and New Zealanders, and after recognising the difficulty friends faced getting regular news and sport updates from home, the brothers, then aged 18 and 22, set about creating a weekly magazine to meet the needs of the hundreds of thousands of Aussies, Kiwis and Saffas who visit London (South Africans did not arrive in large numbers until the post- apartheid era in the early 1990s). The first edition had only 48 pages, but within several years this had increased to 350 pages, with a weekly print run of 75,000. Distribution The UK version was the first magazine to reach readers via distribution bins in key areas across London. It was also available from pubs, hostels and travel agents, then later from internet cafes. The Australian and New Zealand versions followed the same distribution methods. In the UK, it is aimed at Australians, New Zealanders and South Africans living, working and travelling in the UK (though mostly in London). In Australia, the magazine is aimed at British, Irish, European and, increasingly, North American travellers. The magazine focuses on travel, jobs, accommodation, plus news and sport from home, and offers tips on living in London (UK version) and Australasia (Australia & New Zealand versions). TNT UK also publishes a guide to the UK and Ireland for Australians, New Zealanders and South Africans planning to move to the UK or Ireland, while TNT Downunder produces a similar annual title targeting those wanting to travel (and in many cases move) to Australia, New Zealand or Fiji. Other media TNT Multimedia, which owns the UK magazine, also owns South African Times and South African Times.co.uk, and brings out quarterly teaching and finance directories, among other ad hoc supplements. TNTMagazine.com, linked to the UK magazine, was relaunched in October 2008 having previously existed under various urls. TNT Jobs - a standalone jobs board, advertises jobs in the UK, Australia and New Zealand. The magazine also runs regular travel and recruitment exhibitions for its readers, as well as an annual travel writing and photography awards competition. In 2000, TNT magazine was sold by the brothers to Trader Media Group for a sum reportedly in excess of ¬£30 million, and in February 2008, Trader Media Group sold it on to Red Reef Media. Use of the TNT name It was originally intended to be the Independent Travel and News, however this clashed with Independent Television News, so they came up with The News and Travel ‚Äì TNT. A letter was written to the Australian-founded freight company, TNT, who did not object to the new magazine‚Äôs name. However, two years later, TNT‚Äôs freight chairman, on a visit from Australia in London, snared a copy of the magazine from opposite Harrods. The magazine soon got a letter saying it could not use the TNT name. The Razuki brothers had kept TNT freight‚Äôs initial approval letter, which settled matters in their favour. In September 2013, TNT Multimedia was formally put into administration.

It was built as the home of furniture magnate Amos Giles Rhodes, proprietor of Atlanta-based Rhodes Furniture. The Romanesque Revival house occupies a prominent location on Peachtree Street, the main street of Atlanta, and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. It is open to the public and has been the home of The Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation since 1983. Inspiration Rhodes Hall is a Romanesque Revival house inspired by the Rhineland castles that Rhodes admired on a trip to Europe in the late 1890s. Architect Willis F. Denny designed the unique home with Stone Mountain granite, incorporating medieval Romanesque, Victorian, and Arts and Crafts designs as well as necessary adaptations for an early 20th-century home. After two years of construction, the house was completed in 1904. Victorian architecture Known as Le R√™ve (\\"The Dream\\"), Rhodes Hall is one of the finest intact expressions of medievalism and late Victorian architectural design in Atlanta.See Richard Utz, Medievalism: A Manifesto (Bradford: UK: ARC Humanities Press, 2017), chapter 4: Race and Medievalism in Atlanta's Rhodes Hall. The grandest feature of the interior is a magnificent series of stained and painted glass windows that rise above a carved mahogany staircase. The three-panel series depicts the rise and fall of the Confederacy from Fort Sumter to Appomattox, and includes medallion portraits of over a dozen Confederates. These confederate officers include ardent opponents of reconstruction (Robert Toombs, 1810-1885), a Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan (Nathan Bedford Forrest, 1821-1877), and the head of the Ku Klux Klan in the State of Georgia (John B. Gordon, 1832-1904).Richard Utz, \\"Cupid at the Castle: Romance, Medievalism, and Race at Atlanta's Rhodes Hall,\\" The Public Medievalist (4 April, 2017) The famed Rhodes Hall windows depict the birth of the Confederacy Characteristics The house cost Rhodes $50,000 to build in 1904. Wired for electricity when it was built, Rhodes Hall is a prime example of the fascination that new technology held for Atlantans at the turn of the century. Over 300 light bulbs light the entire house. The house also had electric call buttons in most rooms as well as a security system.http://www.georgiatrust.org/historic_sites/rhodeshallhistory.htm Among the materials used to build the home, the mahogany was from the West Indies and the exterior granite was brought over in 500-pound (227 kg) blocks in wagons from Stone Mountain, located about east of Atlanta. Although Rhodes Hall is now surrounded by commercial buildings and heavy traffic, it has survived damage due to careful historic preservation and restoration efforts. After the death of Rhodes and his wife, their children deeded the house to the U.S. state of Georgia, with a restriction that it be used for \\"historic purposes\\". State historian Ruth Blair moved the Georgia Department of Archives and History to the house, and lived in the house as well. It was used to house the Georgia State Archives from 1930 to 1965. After the Archives moved to a more modern building, Rhodes Hall continued to provide archive services as a branch. In 1983 Rhodes Hall was transferred to the Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation, which undertook a long-term restoration program. The main stair and windows, which had been moved to the new Archives, were brought back and re-installed in 1990. From 1984 to 1992, the house was a haunted house attraction every year for Halloween, prior to renovation and conversion to a museum. House museum Rhodes Hall is used as both an event space and as the offices of the Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation. There are house tours on Saturdays (from 10 - 2, the last tour starts at 1) and group tours can be given on other days with advance arrangement. Rhodes Hall is also available for rentals including weddings, receptions, corporate events, cocktail gatherings, and birthday parties. Rhodes Center In 1937, the Rhodes Center, Atlanta's first shopping center, was built on the north, west and south sides of Rhodes Hall (photo, p.5). Only the south building remains.

He was initially on the supplementary list as a Football League match official but even so was selected to participate in the 1948 Olympic Games football tournament along with George Reader, Stanley Boardman and A. C. Williams from Brighton. Ling refereed both the first round match involving Sweden, the quarter-final involving Italy and was then selected for the final between Sweden and Yugoslavia. The final itself turned on two penalty decisions early in the second half (both which were denied to the Yugoslavians) and which affected their temperament. Bernard Joy, in the 1960 publication \\"Association Football\\" (p. 470), wrote: \\"The setbacks rattled the Yugoslavs, their behaviour got out of hand for a spell and they did not recover their rhythm. What made matters worse was when Gunnar Gren converted a penalty midway through the second half. It is true that Gunnar Nordahl was bowled over, but the offence looked no worse than those committed by the Swedish centre half Bertil Nordahl.\\" 1951 FA Cup Final By the start of the next season (1948‚Äì49) Ling had become a Football League referee, and within 3 years had been appointed to control an FA Cup Final. Ling refereed the FA Cup Final in 1951, in which Newcastle United beat Blackpool with two Jackie Milburn goals. On the day of the Final, Ling spotted a policeman as he arrived at Wembley Stadium. He recognised him as a player he had sent off previously during a Sunday league fixture and as he passed him, said: \\"Now what do you think?\\" The officer replied: \\"I still think you are no f*****g good!\\"Ling's conversation with policeman at Wembley: Ely City FC website. 1954 World Cup The 1954 World Cup was only his second international tournament not having been selected for the 1950 FIFA World Cup. He was one of a group of four referees appointed from the United Kingdom for the 1954 tournament. The others were Benjamin Mervyn Griffiths from Wales, Arthur Ellis from Yorkshire and Charles Edward Faultless (Scotland). In the course of the tournament, Ling had already refereed the Group match between Hungary and West Germany (in which the Hungarians had won 8‚Äì3 against the West German team of mainly reserve players) and had assisted Arthur Ellis during the Battle of Berne quarter-final. In the final he was assisted by Griffiths and the Italian Vincenzo Orlandini.1954 World Cup Statistics: TotalFootball.org website. =The Final= Ling's part in the final, between Hungary and West Germany, became slightly controversial because he accepted Griffith's offside flag in the final minutes to deny Ferenc Pusk√°s a 3-3 equalizer could have sent the game into extra-time. West German radio reporter Herbert Zimmermann had called Pusk√°s offside well before he kicked. Willy Meisl observed, later, that it appeared that goal keeper Gyula Grosics had struck Ling following the final whistle. Nothing came of this incident and the mood amongst the Hungarians had settled when the trophy was handed to the West Germans. The Miracle of Bern The final match itself became the subject of a German film Miracle of Bern in which the story of the match is told. Joachim Floryszak, a non-League German football referee and civil servant, starred as Ling after contacting the director S√∂nke Wortmann begging to be given a place in the film.

This assessment is equivalent to all other ACT Assessments administered on national test dates throughout the country. Since this is an actual college entrance exam, results from this assessment can be submitted for college entrance by the student to their college or university of choice. The CO ACT Assessment consists of two parts which are designed to help students prepare for postsecondary educational opportunities. The first part is a pre-test session which includes an interest inventory, a student profile section, and a course/grade section. The second part is the academic assessment section which includes tests in the areas of English, Mathematics, Reading, and Science. From the tests, students receive a composite score along with scores for each of the skill areas. The CO ACT assessment also provides two sub scores in English, three sub scores in Mathematics, and two sub scores in Reading.

The distillery closed in 1989. Although there are whiskey products currently on the market using the Bomberger's and Michter's brand names, they are more recently introduced products that have no direct connection to the old distillery. The complex, located near Schaefferstown, Pennsylvania, represented the transformation of whiskey distilling from an agricultural enterprise into a large-scale industry. The surviving still house, warehouse, and jug house date from about 1840, but the site has a documented history of spirit production since 1753. Bomberger's was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, and was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1980. The facility was America's smallest commercial distiller at the time of its 1989 closure. and History In 1753, John and Michael Shenk, Swiss Mennonite farmers, began distilling rye whiskey at the site. John Shenk's son-in-law, Rudolph Meyer, acquired the distillery and another relative, John Kratzer, ran the business from 1827 to about 1860. Several of the buildings date to Kratzer's tenure. About 1860, Abraham Bomberger, a Pennsylvania Dutchman who had ties to the Shenk family, purchased the distillery from the Kratzer family. With Prohibition the distillery closed in 1919. Ephraim Sechrist bought the distillery in 1920, but did not operate it until 1934 after Prohibition ended, selling it to Louis Forman in 1942. Forman sold the distillery soon after he was drafted for service in World War II, but repurchased it in 1950 after two other owners. One of these owners was Schenley Distilleries. Forman and his master distiller, Charles Everett Beam, of the well known Kentucky distilling family, designed a premium old-fashioned pot-still mash whiskey that they named \\"Michter's Original Sour Mash Whiskey\\" after Forman's sons Michael and Peter. In 1951 Forman distilled the first batch of Michter's, but by the time it had aged the required six years a recession prevented him from selling it. The distillery was acquired by Pennco Distillers, while Forman kept the formula and the aged whiskey. Pennco then used the facility for contract distilling until 1978 and Forman distributed Michter's Whiskey through his liquor wholesaling business. About 1978 Forman and his Lebanon County backers organized Michter's Distillery, Inc., which bought the distillery at the foreclosure sale of Pennco. Michter's and the distillery finally closed in 1989 after a bankruptcy filling.

The concept is found both in the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches, and is mentioned extensively in the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches. Historical background =Canons of the Apostles= Bishop Hilarion Alfeyev, of the Russian Orthodox Church, asserts that The Canons prescribe that: # the bishop should not leave his diocese and go over to another without authorization (can. 14); # the bishop may not ordain outside the boundaries of his diocese (can. 35); # when transferring to another city, excommunicated clergymen or laymen cannot be accepted into communion by another bishop (can. 12); # clergymen who go over to another diocese without the consent of their bishop are deprived of the right to serve (can. 15); # prohibition of serving or excommunication of a clergyman imposed by one bishop cannot by removed by another bishop (can. 16, 32). \\"In defining the boundaries of ecclesiastical territories, the Fathers of the ancient undivided Church took into account civil territorial divisions established by secular authorities,\\" according to Alfeyev, \\"[a]lthough the principle of having ecclesiastical territories correspond to civil ones was accepted as a guiding principle in the ancient Church, it was never absolutized or viewed as having no alternatives.\\" Alfeyev cites the conflict between two bishops, Basil of Caesarea and Anthimus of Tyana, as an example. =Council of Ephesus= The Churches that accepted the teaching of the 431 Council of Ephesus (which condemned the views of Nestorius) classified as heretics those who rejected the Council's teaching. Those who accepted it lived mostly in the Roman Empire and classified themselves as orthodox; they considered the others, who lived mainly under Persian rule, as Nestorian heretics. These had a period of great expansion in Asia. Monuments of their presence still exist in China. Now they are relatively few in numbers and are divided into three Churches, of which the Chaldaean Church, which is in communion with Rome, is the most numerous, while the others have recently split between the Assyrian Church of the East and the Ancient Church of the East. =Council of Chalcedon= In the middle of the 5th century, a number of Eastern Churches rejected the Council of Chalcedon of 451 thus creating a schism which led to the rise of \\"parallel hierarchies\\". Those who accepted the 451 Council of Chalcedon similarly classified those who rejected it as Monophysite heretics. The Churches that refused to accept the Council considered instead that it was they who were orthodox. The six present-day Churches that continue their tradition reject the description Monophysite, preferring instead Miaphysite. They are often called, in English, Oriental Orthodox Churches, to distinguish them from the Eastern Orthodox Churches. These churches are also referred to as pre-Chalcedonian or, now more rarely, as non-Chalcedonian or anti-Chalcedonian. =East‚ÄìWest Schism= The East‚ÄìWest Schism came about in a context of cultural differences between the Greek- speaking East and the Latin-speaking West and of rivalry between the Churches in Rome, which claimed a primacy not merely of honour but also of authority, and in Constantinople, which claimed parity with that in Rome.Theodore Balsamon on the Powers of the Patriarch of Constantinople The rivalry and lack of comprehension gave rise to controversies, some of which appear already in the acts of the Quinisext Council of 692. At the Council of Florence (1431‚Äì1445), these controversies about Western theological elaborations and usages were identified as, chiefly, the insertion of \\"Filioque\\" in the Nicene Creed, the use of unleavened bread for the Eucharist, purgatory, and the authority of the Pope. The schism is conventionally dated to 1054, when the Patriarch of Constantinople and the Papal Legate Humbert of Mourmoutiers issued mutual excommunications that have since been revoked. In spite of that event, both Churches continued for many years to maintain friendly relations and seemed to be unaware of any formal or final rupture.Milton V. Anastos, Constantinople and Rome However, estrangement continued to grow. =Crusades= The sack of Constantinople in 1204 by the participants in the Fourth Crusade was seen by the Eastern Orthodox as the West's ultimate outrage. By then, each side considered that the other no longer belonged to the Church that was orthodox and catholic. =Uniatism= Over the course of centuries, the Catholic Church worked to expand into the Orthodox East and to bring the Orthodox under the authority of the Bishop of Rome. The Catholic Church effected a number of unions such as Lyons (1274), Florence (1439), Brest (1596), Uzhgorod (1646), Mukachevo (1733), as well as the unions in the Orthodox Near East: the Armenian, Coptic, Syro-Jacobite, Syro-Chaldean etc. The Eastern Catholic Churches are autonomous, self-governing (in Latin, sui iuris) particular Churches in full communion with the Bishop of Rome‚Äîthe pope. They preserve some of the centuries-old liturgical, devotional, and theological traditions of the various Eastern Christian Churches with which they were once associated. Present situation Canonical territories of autocephalous and autonomous Eastern Orthodox jurisdictions. The issue of canonical territory has proven to be a significant point of dispute for the Moscow Patriarchate, which opposes on the one hand the Constantinople Patriarch's influence in Ukraine, and on the other the perceived Roman Catholic influence within Russia itself. =Russian Orthodox Church= The meaning of canonical territory in the context of the Russian Orthodox Church \\"is not self-evident, and no detailed explanation of it is given in any official document.\\" The Russian Orthodox Church defines the geographic extent of its canonical territory as including all the territory within China, Japan, and the post-Soviet states excluding Armenia and Georgia. It statutes define its sphere of jurisdiction as including \\"also Orthodox Christians living in other countries\\" outside of its canonical territory. The geographic extent of the canonical territory defined by the Russian Orthodox Church is disputed by other Orthodox Churches. =Eastern Catholic Churches= In the Eastern Catholic Churches that have the rank of patriarchate, the patriarchal synod elects bishops for the patriarchate's canonical territory. Bishops who head eparchies situated outside that territory are appointed by the Pope.Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 181 Canonical territories of some Eastern Catholic Churches, as in the case of the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church and the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church, may overlap geographically, but are distinct with regard to the faithful involved. =Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church= =Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church= =Phyletism= In diaspora countries such as France and the United States, problems with canonical territory have often given rise to the problem of phyletism, which is defined as the principle of nationalities applied in the ecclesiastical domain and the confusion between Church and nation.

Edinburgh: 1905 His son, Alexander Monro primus, by then Professor of Anatomy, circulated an anonymous pamphlet in 1721 on the necessity and advantage of erecting a Hospital for the Sick Poor. In 1725 the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh wrote to the stock-holders of the Fishery Company, which was about to be wound up, suggesting that they assign their shares for the purpose of such a hospital. Other donors included many wealthy citizens, most of the physicians and several surgeons, numerous Church of Scotland parishes (at the urging of their Assembly) and the Episcopal meeting houses in Edinburgh.An Account of the Rise and Establishment of the Infirmary, or HOSPITAL for SICK- POOR, erected at Edinburgh. 1730. Reprinted prob. 1980 Plaque marking the founding of the Infirmary The committee set up by the donors leased \\"a house of small rent\\" near the College from the University for 19 years. Known, at first, as the Hospital for the Sick Poor, the Physicians' Hospital, or Little House, it was established on 6 August 1729 at the head of Robertson's Close on the site of the building on the corner of South Bridge and Infirmary Street, now marked with a plaque. A \\"gentlewoman\\" was engaged as Mistress or House- keeper, and a \\"Nurse or Servant\\" was hired for the patients, both women to be resident and \\"free of the burden of children and the care of a separate family.\\" The physicians, who had seen the poor gratis twice weekly at their college, arranged for one of their number to attend the hospital, to see both inpatients and outpatients. Six Surgeon-Apothecaries (Alexander Monro, John McGill, Francis Congalton, Robert Hope, John Douglas and George Cunninghame) also agreed to attend in turn, and to dispense the medicines prescribed by the physicians from their own shops, also without payment.Grants Old and New Edinburgh The first patient, a lady from Caithness suffering from \\"chlorosis,\\" was discharged recovered after three months. Thirty five patients were admitted in the first year, of whom 19 were cured, 5 recovered, 5 dismissed either as incurable or for irregularities and one died in the hospital (of \\"consumption\\"). They came from all over Scotland, but mainly from Edinburgh and its environs. Diseases cured included pains, inflammations, agues, ulcers, cancers, palsies, flux, consumption, hysterick disorders and melancholy. A free advice and medicine service for out-patients was very popular, receiving a 1,000 patients by 1754, which presented the hospital with prohibitively high costs and demand. Fundraising began for a new hospital, driven by Monro and Drummond, and the appeal attracted funds from churches throughout Scotland, landed gentry, private individuals, and prominent professionals including physicians, surgeons, merchants and lawyers, as well as donations of labour and building materials. =Infirmary Street= Old Surgical Hospital in Drummond Street The infirmary received a Royal Charter from George II in 1736 which gave it its name of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh and commissioned William Adam to design a new hospital on a site close by to the original building, on what later became Infirmary Street. In 1741 the hospital moved the short distance to the not yet completed building which eventually, on its completion in 1745, had 228 beds compared to 4 beds in the Little House. By the 1830s the hospital had become short of space and, in 1832, the former Royal High School in nearby High School Yards, built by Alexander Laing in 1777, was converted to a surgical hospital with a new operating theatre built to the east. This was soon found to be inadequate and a new surgical hospital, designed by David Bryce, was built fronting Drummond Street, opening in 1853. The new building was linked to the High School Yards building by an extension to the north. The Infirmary Street buildings were demolished in 1884 and replaced with public swimming baths and a school. The ornamental gates and gate piers now front the former surgical hospital on Drummond Street. The four attached Ionic columns on the frontispiece of the hospital were removed and incorporated as a combined column in a monument to the Covenanters who were defeated at the Battle of Rullion Green. This stands outside the entrance to Dreghorn Barracks on Redford Road in the south west of the city. The original surgical theatre, which was on the roof of the 1741 building, was re-erected as part of stables in the grounds of Redford House, also on Redford Road. It has since been converted into a house known as Drummond Scrolls taking its name from the large attached carved bracket scrolls, also from the surgical theatre of 1741. The house is category B-listed by Historic Scotland. =The New System= Significant changes came with the introduction of the \\"New System\\" in 1873. Four years before, Sir Joseph Lister had been appointed as Professor of Surgery to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh.Goldmann M (1987) Lister ward. Bristol: Adam Hilger Using antiseptics and narcotics he proved to be very successful, thus attracting patients from higher social classes to the hospital.Wrench G T (1913) Lord Lister. His Life and Work. London: Fisher Unwin The hospital managers felt the existing nurses were lacking both medical knowledge and appropriate behaviour. They appointed Deputy Surgeon-General Charles Hamilton Fasson as Medical Superintendent. Fasson recruited a group of 17 trained Nightingale Nurses from St. Thomas‚Äôs Hospital London. In 1873 Elizabeth Barclay and Ang√©lique Lucille Pringle started building up a system of nursing where the nurses were under the control of the Lady Superintendent of Nurses instead of individual ward doctors. They also introduced a systematic training of nurses, who were, after one year of probation, admitted to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh‚Äôs Register Book. Accordingly, the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh had implemented the first Scottish nursing school. Up to the movement into the new buildings 102 probationers had been entered into the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh‚Äôs Registry Book.Schmidt-Richter R; A review of the introduction of systematic training for nurses at the Royal Infirmary Edinburgh 1872 - 1879. Edinburgh, Univ., Master of science in nursing and health studies, 1993 =Lauriston Place= Clocktower of the old Royal Infirmary in Lauriston Place Floor plan of the Lauriston Place site in 1893 In 1879, at the instruction of the then Lord Provost, Thomas Jamieson Boyd, the infirmary moved to a new location, then in the fresher air of the edge of the city. The site, on Lauriston Place, had been occupied by George Watson's Hospital (a school, known then as a hospital). The school moved a short distance away to the former Merchant Maiden Hospital (another school) in Archibald Place. The original school building, by the same William Adam as the earlier infirmary, was incorporated into the new David Bryce-designed infirmary buildings and the chapel remained in use for the entirety of the infirmary's occupation of the site. In the 1920s the hospital needed to expand, and once again George Watson's College was asked to move. An arrangement was reached to acquire the school's site, with the school to remain there until new premises could be built elsewhere. By 1932 the school's new premises in Colinton Road were ready, and the old Archibald Place building was demolished to make way for the Simpson Memorial Pavilion, used primarily as a maternity wing. In 1948, the infirmary was incorporated into the National Health Service (NHS). The liver transplant unit opened in 1992. In May 2001, Lothian Health Trust sold the Lauriston Place site for ¬£30 million to Southside Capital Ltd., a consortium comprising Taylor Woodrow, Kilmartin Property Group, and the Bank of Scotland. It has been redeveloped as the Quartermile housing, shopping, leisure and hotel development. Much of the David Bryce infirmary will remain visible, but some infirmary buildings have been demolished. In the build-up to the move to Little France the Royal Charter awarded by George II in 1736 was rediscovered. =Little France= A new hospital, sited on a mostly green field site at Little France in the south-east of the city, was procured under a Private Finance Initiative contract in 1998. The new location reflected the need for the hospital to serve not just people living in Edinburgh, but also Midlothian and East Lothian. The new hospital is physically linked to the Chancellor's Building, the main teaching facility for the University of Edinburgh Medical School. The new building, which was designed by Keppie Design and constructed by Balfour Beatty at a cost of ¬£184 million, opened in 2003. The building was built without air conditioning, and portable units are required for the summer months. The Little France site initially attracted some controversy in the local media, such as the Edinburgh Evening News, not least because the city's main accident and emergency facilities are some distance from the city centre, and also because the public transport links to the site had been criticised as inadequate. Also Jim and Margaret Cuthbert, economic consultants, unveiled evidence in the Scottish Left Review outlining why the PFI scheme was a poor use of public funds whilst resulting in huge profits for private investors. In 2012, the hospital began TAVI procedures, the first tme this offered in Scotland. On 16 November 2014, the University announced the Royal Infirmary as the location of Scotland's first PET-MRI Scanner. In 2016 the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh became one of four major trauma centres where specialist services are based as part of a new national major trauma network in Scotland. The Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh is being rebuilt on the Little France site beside the Infirmary with an opening date that has yet to be announced. In 2020, the hospital saw the Department for Clinical Neurosciences move to the Little France site having previously been based at Western General Hospital; senior doctors condemned the move in the middle of the covid-19 crisis as \\"incomprehensible\\".

Beginning in the key of D major, modulating to Bb major, then ending in F major, this is the most important song for the role of √âponine. In the song, she expresses her unrequited love for the character Marius, and how she dreams of being at his side but knows his love is for Cosette and not for her. The solo did not exist in the original French show that opened in 1980. When the English version was written, the music for \\"On My Own\\" was adapted from the original French solo \\"L'Air de la Mis√®re\\" which was sung by Fantine about her misery and suffering. In turn, √âponine's original French solo, \\"L'un Vers L'autre\\", was dropped in the English version. In the later 1991 Parisian version, the title was \\"Mon Histoire\\" (My story). However, \\"On My Own\\" has become one of the most famous songs in the musical, and √âponine one of its most popular characters. The first actress to play √âponine (English version) on stage was Frances Ruffelle; her version of \\"On My Own\\" is preserved on both the Original London and Broadway cast albums. It has appeared in many famous events outside of Les Mis√©rables. Michelle Kwan skated to \\"On My Own\\" during the 1997 Skate America competition as well as the 1998 Tokyo Golden Gala.

He was characterized as a modernist designer that played with the refinements of couture style, a modernist aesthetic, and the desire to be socially and culturally advanced.  Overview  Born in London to Justin Molyneux and Lizzy Kenny, Edward Molyneux attended Beaumont College, a Roman Catholic preparatory school. Owing to the death of his father, he dropped out at age 16 to support himself and his mother while pursuing ambitions as a painter and illustrator. Molyneux soon found employment as a sketch artist for the London magazine Smart Set where his drawings of fashionable women attracted the attention of the celebrated couturier Lucile (in private life Lady Duff Gordon). She hired him as a sketcher in her London salon in 1910 and by the end of the following year had promoted him to assistant designer at her Paris branch.Vogue, 15 August 1952,p. 178; Georgina O'Hara Callan, The Thames and Hudson Dictionary of Fashion and Fashion Designers (1998), pp. 166-167; Valerie D. Mendes and Amy de la Haye, Lucile Ltd, p. 187; Randy Bryan Bigham, Lucile - Her Life by Design (2012), p. 119. Working for Lucile in London, Paris and New York until the outbreak of World War I, Molyneux joined the British Army's Duke of Wellington regiment with which he fought in the Battle of Arras, attaining the rank of captain but losing the sight in one eye. For a time, he worked in the Admiralty's signals intelligence unit, Room 40. He returned to work for Lucile after being invalided out of the war but a disagreement with her resulted in his termination in 1919.Howard Greer, Designing Male (1951), pp. 116-117; Caroline Evans, The Mechanical Smile (2013),p. 269. Molyneux opened his own fashion house in Paris at 14 rue Royale in November 1919 (later, 5 rue Royale), expanding to Monte Carlo in 1925, Cannes in 1927, and London in 1932. The designer quickly became known for an impeccably refined simplicity. Molyneux was, as historian Caroline Milbank wrote, \\"the designer to whom a fashionable woman would turn if she wanted to be absolutely right without being utterly predictable in the Twenties and Thirties.\\"Caroline Rennolds Milbank, Couture: The Great Designers (1985), p. 144. Frowning on superfluous decoration, he regularly dressed European royals, including Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent.Caroline Rennolds Milbank, Couture: The Great Designers (1985), p. 144. He was also a favorite with trendsetting actresses like Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich, Gertrude Lawrence, Margaret Leighton, and Vivien Leigh. Proteges included future couturiers Christian Dior and Pierre Balmain, and he was friends with playwright No√´l Coward. During World War II, he moved his firm to London for the duration of the conflict and returned to Paris in 1946. Retiring in 1950, Molyneux left his fashion house in the hands of Jacques Griffe. He resumed designing in 1964, opening Studio Molyneux, a high quality ready-to-wear line that received mixed reviews. During this period Time magazine described him as \\"the Parisian equivalent of Manhattan's Mainbocher, a classicist devoted to the soft look and tailored line.\\"Time magazine He retired again in 1969, but Studio Molyneux continued under the direction of his cousin John Tullis until it closed in 1977. The Molyneux trademark is owned by French company Parfums Berdoues, and though the fashion component of the firm remains dormant, the firm still produces scents, such as Captain (1975), Quartz (1978), Le Chic, Vivre, I Love You and Quartz Pure Red (2008).  Personal life  Molyneux, of Irish and French Huguenot ancestry, had a complicated personal life. One of his early relationships was with Foreign Office diplomat Harold Nicolson, who helped finance the opening of the designer's first Paris salon. Although married to writer Vita Sackville-West, Nicolson was open with her about his affairs, including his fling with Molyneux.Victoria Glendinning, Vita: The Life of V. Sackville-West (1983), p. 106. In 1923 Molyneux married (Jessie) Muriel Dunsmuir (1890‚Äì1951), one of eight daughters of the Hon. James Dunsmuir, Premier of British Columbia. They divorced in 1924.  Paintings  Molyneux painted throughout his life, and exhibitions of his paintings were held at the Galerie Weill in Paris (between 1950‚Äì1956) and at the Hammer Galleries in New York (1967). Here, 'Carnations in Vase' was purchased by the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, and 'Roses in Glass' by Greta Garbo. Molyneux's Uncle, Maj. Edward Mary Joseph Molyneux, during his years in the Himalayan Valley of Kashmir, painted many scenes of the capital city of Srinagar and other areas which inspired him. The paintings were published in a book titled Kashmir accompanied by descriptions of the Valley by Francis Younghusband. Captain Molyneux also amassed an extensive Impressionist art collection, including paintings by Picasso, Monet, Manet and 17 by Renoir. They were sold as a 'lot' to Ailsa Mellon Bruce, who bestowed the entire collection on the National Gallery of Art.  Trivia  In season 5 episode 3 of the successful British TV-show Downton Abbey the character of Cora, the countess of Grantham, briefly mentions a fitting with Molyneux as a reason for a trip to London.

They had an ever-changing line-up of musicians and five UK hit singles, all on the Deram Records label, in the early 1970s. Career White Plains evolved from the late 1960s pop/psychedelic band The Flower Pot Men, composed of Tony Burrows, Pete Nelson, and Robin Shaw together with Neil Landon (who went to Fat Mattress). The band was primarily a studio project led by John Carter. The last single of the Flower Pot Men for Deram Records was composed by Roger Greenaway and was an attempt at a hit single in the style of the then popular Love Affair called \\"In A Moment of Madness\\". The single did not chart and for the next single the band's name was changed to White Plains. The band's songs were mainly produced and written by Greenaway and Roger Cook. White Plains released several hit songs, including 1970's \\"My Baby Loves Lovin'\\" (number 13 on the US charts and number 4 in Canada), and 1971's \\"When You Are A King\\" (number 13 on the UK Singles Chart) that was translated to Hebrew and covered by the Israeli singer, Shlomo Artzi. \\"Lovin' You Baby\\" reached number 35 in Canada. White Plains kept changing their line-up during its relatively short existence. Burrows was the band's original lead singer. At the same time Burrows did studio work, singing on hits by The Brotherhood of Man, The Pipkins (again with Roger Greenaway), and Edison Lighthouse. Dave Kerr- Clemenson also left Edison Lighthouse in 1973 to join White Plains. The group's top-selling song \\"My Baby Loves Lovin'\\", was recorded on 26 October 1969, and was released on 9 January 1970 on the Decca Records imprint, Deram Records. The song has been featured on many CDs, including a White Plains compilation and The Voice of Tony Burrows, a compilation of hits sung by Burrows under the various group names. The full-length album version of \\"My Baby Loves Lovin'\\" has never been featured on any CD. \\"I've Got You on My Mind\\" was a UK hit, reaching number 17.

It stars June Lockhart and Don Porter. The film is set in London in the early 20th century, where a series of murders have recently occurred. An aunt then tells an innocent young lady that the blood of a werewolf runs in her family and that she is responsible for the deaths. The women then immediately end her engagement, leading to her partner to begin investigating the strange case on his own. Plot In London at the beginning of the twentieth century, Phyllis Allenby is a young and beautiful woman who is soon to be married to barrister and boyfriend Barry Lanfield. Phyllis is living at the Allenby Mansion without the protection of a male, along with her aunt Martha and her cousin Carol and the servant Hannah. As the wedding date approaches, London is shocked by a series of murders at the local park, where the victims are discovered with throats ripped out. Many of the detectives at Scotland Yard begin murmuring about werewolves, while Inspector Pierce believes the opposite and suspects strange activity at the Allenby Mansion (which is near the park), where the \\"Wolf-Woman\\" is seen prowling at night and heading for the park. Phyllis becomes extremely terrified and anxious, since she is convinced that she is the \\"Wolf-Woman\\", deeply believing in the legend of the so-called \\"Curse of the Allenbys\\". Aunt Martha tries to convince Phyllis how ridiculous the legend sounds, while she (Aunt Martha) and Carol are suspicious in their own ways. Phyllis each day denies Barry visiting her, and when a suspicious detective is murdered soon after he visits the mansion in the same way the other victims perished, Barry begins believing that something else is going on beside the so-called \\"Werewolf murders\\", and makes his own investigations both of the park and the mansion. It turns out that Aunt Martha did the attacks to convince Phyllis she was insane, and belonged in an asylum rather than married to Barry, so Martha and her daughter could remain living in the mansion. Cast Production Una O'Connor was initially set to be in the cast, but was dropped in favor of Eily Malyon. Forrester Harvey was also set to star in the film, but died on December 14, 1945. The film began shooting on December 8, 1945 and wrapped production on the 21st, three days over schedule. Don Porter recalled the last days of shooting, noting a scene with a buggy that was done as process shooting. Porter recalled that \\"they closed the set so people couldn't get away and go to all the Christmas parties on the other sets. We damned near starved to death. We smuggled some sandwiches and finally got the process right. \\" He also recaleld the \\"bee smoke\\" used in the park scenes made it difficult to talk, saying that \\"trying to do lines and keep from choking was a little difficult.\\" June Lockhart recalled the film was \\"fun to do. If I'm remembering right, I was just submitted for it by my agent. I did it., and - I was not very good in it. But the following year I was the hot ingenue on Broadway in a wonderful comedy, so I guess what I needed [in She- Wolf] was a good direction. \\" Release She-Wolf of London was shown in New York on April 5, 1946. It received wider release by Universal Pictures on May 17, 1946. On its release in the United Kingdom, the film was titled The Curse of the Allenbys. She-Wolf of London was released on DVD as part of the '' \\"Wolf Man: The Legacy Collection\\" set which included The Wolf Man, Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man and Werewolf of London. It was released again as a double feature with Werewolf of London on July 24, 2007. Reception From contemporary reviews, Thomas M. Pryor of The New York Times wrote that \\"this latest release from Universal's bottom-drawer [...] it certainly doesn't justify the effort expended in its behalf.\\" A reviewer in Harrison's Reports found it \\"boresome and long-drawn out\\" with a plot that \\"has been done many times [...] there is nothing about either the action or the characters that is horrifying or terrifying.\\" Jack D. Grant of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review, noting Yaborough's ability to generation suspicions and that \\"it was a difficult task to balance these strange acts by other characters at the same time maintain the mood of the period piece.\\" Dorothy Masters of The New York Daily News gave the film a two and half star rating, opining that the film \\"does a fancy job tight-rope walking until everything is keyed for jump in the right direction.\\" From retrospective reviews, the authors of the book Universal Horrors described the film as \\"the kind of chiller horror fans love to hate\\", specifically, teasing the audience with horror themes only to disclose that the supernatural was not responsible for the horror previously, concluding that \\"there's absolutely no reason why George Bricker and Dwight V. Babcock could not have conceived the tale as a bonafide horror story rather than a predictable whodunit.\\" Hans J. Wollstein of AllMovie also noted critiqued the story finding it closer to a film of the silent film era\\" and that that \\"She-Wolf of London should have come with a disclaimer. There is no \\"She-Wolf\\" in this quasi-horror opus, just a greedy old dame (Sara Haden) \\"gaslighting\\" poor, anemic June Lockhart in order to inherit the girl's fortune.\\" while \\"Jean Yarborough and cameraman Maury Gertsman did their best to liven things up with odd camera angles and moody mise-en-sc√®ne, but all this was merely wasted on a typical Universal \\"B\\"\\" References =Footnotes= =Sources=  External links 1946 horror films 1946 films 1940s historical horror films 1940s serial killer films 1940s mystery films American black-and-white films American films English-language films Films directed by Jean Yarbrough Pre-1960 horror film stubs Universal Pictures films Films set in country houses Films set in London Films set in the 1900s American historical films Films scored by William Lava ","title":"She-Wolf of London (film)"},{"id":"5023586","text":"Eikeberg is a village in the municipality of Sande, Norway.

It is often used both as a charge on a coat of arms and by itself as an heraldic badge. The heraldic rose has a stylized form consisting of five symmetrical lobes, five barbs, and a circular seed. The rose is one of the most common plant symbols in heraldry, together with the lily, which also has a stylistic representation in the fleur-de-lis.Slater, Stephen (2006). The Illustrated Book of Heraldry. London: Hermes House, 90. The rose was the symbol of the English Tudor dynasty, and the ten-petaled Tudor rose is associated with England. Roses also feature prominently in the arms of the princely House of Lippe and on the seal of Martin Luther. Appearance The normal appearance of the heraldic rose is a five-petaled rose, mimicking the look of a wild rose on a hedgerow. It is shown singly and full-faced. It most commonly has yellow seeds in the center and five green barbs as backing; such a rose is blazoned as barbed and seeded proper. If the seeds and barbs are of a different colour, then the rose is barbed and seeded of that/those tinctures. The rose of Lippe shown above, for example, is blazoned a Rose Gules, barbed and seeded Or. Some variations on the rose have been used. Roses may appear with a stem, in which case they are described as slipped or stalked. A rose with a stalk and leaves may also be referred to as a damask rose, stalked and leaved, as appearing on the Canting arms of the House of Rossetti. Rose branches, slips, and leaves have occasionally appeared in arms alone, without the flower. A combination of two roses, one within the other, is termed a double rose, famously used by the Tudors.Parker, James (1894). Rose. In A Glossary of Terms Used in Heraldry; Web version by Saitou and Jim Trigg (2004). Retrieved March 29, 2009. A rose sometimes appears surrounded by rays, which makes it a rose-en-soleil (rose in the sun). A rose may be crowned. Roses may appear within a chaplet, a garland of leaves with four flowers. In badges, it is not uncommon for a rose to be conjoined with another device. Catherine of Aragon's famous badge was a pomegranate conjoined with the double rose of her husband, Henry VIII.Parker. Usage Heraldic roses feature prominently in English history. The two rival royal houses of the fifteenth century were supposedly known by their heraldic badges, the Red Rose of Lancaster and the White Rose of York, from which their long conflict was later called the Wars of the Roses.Slater, 29. The White Rose of York was later used as the badge of Jacobitism in England and Scotland, and before World War I one of Britain's main Jacobite organizations was called the Order of the White Rose. Red and white roses appear in the civic heraldry of Lancashire and Yorkshire respectively. The House of Tudor that came to power at the end of the wars used a combination of their two roses: the ten-petaled Tudor double rose. The double Tudor rose is always depicted as white on red on a field of any other tincture and is always termed 'proper'. It is used as a floral emblem of England, just as the thistle is associated with Scotland. It appears in the compartment of the coats of arms of both the United Kingdom and Canada. A red rose appears on the collar of the Order of the Garter. The Luther rose, a rose combined with a ring, heart, and Latin cross, was used by Martin Luther as a personal seal. The Luther rose is sometimes used as a charge in its own right, appearing on the arms of a number of German towns. In the English and Canadian systems of cadency, a small rose is the difference mark of a seventh son. In Portugal, a label with three roses was used to differentiate the arms of the Princes of Beira. Roses appear in the coat of arms of Finland and are part of the insignia of officers (up to colonel) in the Finnish Army.

The collapsed section (removed) is shown at left behind frieze. Canal Street The West Side Elevated Highway (West Side Highway or Miller Highway, named for Julius Miller, Manhattan borough president from 1922 to 1930) was an elevated section of New York State Route 9A (NY 9A) running along the Hudson River in the New York City borough of Manhattan to the tip of the island. It was an elevated highway, one of the first urban freeways in the world, and served as a prototype for urban freeways elsewhere, including Boston's Central Artery. Built between 1929 and 1951, the highway had narrow confines‚Äîwhich could not accommodate trucks‚Äîand sharp S exit ramps that made it obsolete almost immediately. Maintenance was minimal, and the use of corrosive salts to de-ice the highway in winter accelerated its decay. When chunks of its facade began to fall off due to lack of maintenance, and a truck and car fell through it at 14th Street in 1973, the highway was shut down, and a debate began whether to renovate it or dismantle it. Attitudes to urban planning had changed in the intervening decades, and the decision was made not to repair the decaying structure. The need to replace the deteriorating highway was recognized in the 1950s. Plans were drafted, but not executed. By 1971, a plan evolved for the elevated highway to be replaced by an underground interstate-quality highway, which came to be called Westway. It received approval from many levels of government, from the city to the federal, but was scuttled in 1985 owing to environmental issues. In the time between the closure of the elevated highway and the completion of its dismantling, while debate about Westway was proceeding, remaining sections of the old highway structure began to be unofficially utilized as an elevated urban park, for jogging and bicycling. By 1989, the old elevated highway structure was totally dismantled except for a small portion from 59th Street to 72nd Street, which, in effect, became the southern extension of the Henry Hudson Parkway. Eventually, a grade-level six lane \\"urban boulevard\\" was built, which is generally referred to as the West Side Highway, although the elements of it use the names of the surface streets which existed before the elevated highway was built: West Street, Eleventh Avenue and Twelfth Avenue. It connects to the remaining elevated structure via a ramp at 57th Street. Early planning =Death Avenue= Chambers Street ramps Before the West Side Highway was built, the road along the Hudson River was busy, with significant cross traffic going to docks and ferries. At 22nd Street, most traffic continued north along Eleventh Avenue, along which the New York Central Railroad (NYCRR)'s West Side Line ran; it was known by many as \\"Death Avenue\\" for the many crashes caused by trains and automobiles colliding. The first official proposal for an elevated highway along Manhattan's west side was made by Police Commissioner Richard Edward Enright on January 12, 1924, in a letter to the New York City Board of Estimate. The highway was to be 100 feet (30 m) wide, running north from the Battery to 72nd Street at Riverside Drive, West End Avenue, or Amsterdam Avenue. According to Enright, \\"During business hours West Street [was] the most congested thoroughfare in the city. Vast quantities of the city's foodstuffs [were] handled in the territory adjacent to West Street.\\" He cited traffic congestion as an extra cost of doing business and a blockage for fire engines. =Plans for the new highway= Double-decker railroad/highway proposal On February 2, 1925, it was announced that the railroad would build a combined double-decker elevated highway and freight railroad (with the highway above the railroad) for $24 million at no cost to the city. At the time, Eleventh Avenue was popularly known as \\"Death Avenue\\" owing to the dangers of the surface line. The elevated structure would eliminate 106 grade crossings over 84 blocks. The proposal came about after six months of negotiations between Manhattan Borough President Julius Miller and the NYCRR. The planned highway would no longer go to the Battery, instead ending at Canal Street, meeting the Holland Tunnel (which would open to traffic on November 13, 1927). The northern terminus was set at 72nd Street and Riverside Drive. Ramps were planned at Canal Street, 23rd Street, Riverside Drive, and at least two other locations. The Port of New York Authority opposed the plan, preferring a more forward-looking comprehensive freight distribution plan. They attacked Miller as trying to push the plan through without input from the Port Authority. The Port Authority wanted a system of inland terminals and belt-line railroads. According to Port Authority Chairman Julian Gregory, it was almost certain that NYCRR would not go along with the Port Authority plan. It was also believed that giving NYCRR elevated tracks on the west side would allow the railroad to monopolize freight and raise prices. The Port Authority believed it was primarily a freight problem, but NYCRR and New York City considered it to be a grade-crossing elimination project. Miller responded by arguing that something had to be done right away. He said that if the Port Authority could put forward a comprehensive plan within five years, he would put his full support behind it. He also pointed out that his plan was only one part of his \\"comprehensive plan for the relief of traffic congestion\\"; he had already widened many avenues and removed several Midtown elevated railroad spurs. He said the plan would not give the NYCRR any rights they did not already have; it was merely a relocation of existing tracks. The tracks had been on the surface for 55 years despite legal action taken against them, and Miller claimed they would be there for another 50 if nothing were done. Miller also received a letter from NYCRR Vice President Ira Place, stating that the railroad would reduce freight rates if the new elevated structure were built. Miller's elevated single-deck highway A plan for Boston's Central Artery, based on the West Side Highway On January 20, 1926, borough president Miller sent a plan for an $11 million elevated highway to be built completely on city property to the Board of Estimate. The elevated railroad was removed from the plan, since NYCRR had come up with a separate project for partially elevating and depressing their railroad (now known as the High Line). According to Miller, there were questions over who would own and maintain the dual structure. There were also objections to its height of 40 feet (12 m) and its placement at the east building line of the existing surface roads. The elevated highway was to connect to a planned parkway (now the Henry Hudson Parkway) at 72nd Street, forming a highway free from cross traffic stretching from Canal Street to 129th Street. The elevated road was to be 60 feet (18 m) wide, wide enough for six lanes of traffic; the existing surface road would carry local traffic beneath the highway. Ramps would be provided at Canal Street, Christopher Street, 14th Street, 23rd Street, 34th Street, 42nd Street, and 57th Street. Slow-moving traffic would use the left lanes, due to the left-hand ramps. This contrasts with the current method of using the left lane for passing and putting ramps on the right side, and to the method popular around the 1950s of putting ramps on whichever side was easier. The highway would \\"carry buses that will make both its conveniences and its beauties available to the general public\\", according to Miller. He suggested Hudson River Boulevard for the name of the highway. On April 24, 1925, Governor Al Smith signed a bill authorizing the construction of the highway. Funds for the $11 million highway were to be procured by property assessments along the route; this was considered reasonable due to advantages gained from the highway by those living along the route. The road was to be , five feet wider than Fifth Avenue, with a speed limit of at least , and would be off the ground. It would be built of steel, with a cement face. A three-foot (1 m) sidewalk would be built for pedestrians, although the highway was intended mainly for motor vehicles. Two-block-long ramps would be provided with easy grades for entering and exiting the highway. Trucks would be allowed on the highway. The Board of Estimate approved the highway, now costing $13.5 million on June 14, 1926. It was to be built so a second deck could be added at a later time for about $9 million if traffic warranted. Controller Charles W. Berry questioned the proposal until he realized the money would come from tax assessments, at which time he agreed with the project. On November 10, 1926, the Sinking Fund Commission voted to give the city title to the waterfront property along the proposed highway. The highway plan was linked to a plan by the city for more piers for ocean steamships; since the highway required land takings between 47th Street and 51st Street, it was easier to combine the projects and prevent additional expense. On February 17, 1927, the Board of Estimate adopted the final plans for the highway, setting a hearing date of March 24. It was split into two sections, Section one went from Canal Street to 59th Street. Section two was to carry the road over the NYCRR's 60th Street Yard from 59th Street to 72nd Street. Section two was approved by the Board of Estimate on August 16, 1928; section one was postponed until September 27 due to objections. On October 18, the Board of Estimate approved section one. The highway was advocated by most business interests, including the Downtown League, the Fifth Avenue Association, the West End Association, and eleven other organizations. They cited increasing traffic and the need of a bypass route to support the highway, which would cost little in comparison to its benefits. Miller spoke at a meeting of the Market and Business Men's Association of the Greenwich and Chelsea Districts on October 30, 1928, detailing plans for the highway. It was announced that between 90 and 100 meat and poultry dealers in the West Washington Market and the Gansevoort Market would be evicted to make way for the highway. Minor changes to the highway were approved on January 10, 1929, in response to several objections. The alignment in the Chelsea district was slightly modified to avoid proposed piers, and the path through the markets was realigned to pass over a corner of the property. In addition, the 14th Street ramps were moved to the area between 19th Street and 23rd Street, where they would spare many markets at 14th Street. In addition, the West Washington Market would no longer be demolished, and instead the highway would graze the roofs of some of the stores. Exotic alternatives An alternate plan was put forth by John Hencken, an engineer, and approved by Ernest P. Goodrich, consulting engineer to the Regional Plan of New York and its Environs. A linear corridor would be built from the Battery to Yonkers. A freight railroad would lie underground. On ground level would be roads alongside the corridor and an indoor enclosed sidewalk. The mezzanine, between the first and second floors, would be occupied by office space. The second floor would carry a \\"continuous noiseless moving platform system for passenger service\\", with adjacent belts moving at various speeds, for a maximum of 21 miles per hour (34 km/h) in the middle. This service would be free, and would be a substitute for new subways in the corridor. Above the second floor would be about ten stories of apartments, offices, businesses, and other uses appropriate for the neighborhoods; these would be the main source of revenue to pay for the project. A high-speed motor parkway, open to passenger cars only, would lie on top. Cars would reach the upper level via ramps at both ends and elevators at convenient intervals. Dr. Benjamin Battin, a professor at Swarthmore College, Pennsylvania, had a similar plan for an eight-story high boulevard. The street level and first floor would be connected to the Hudson River piers. The second and third stories would carry electric passenger trains, with the second floor carrying northbound traffic and southbound traffic using the third floor. A public garage would occupy the fourth and fifth floors, helping to pay off the bonds for the project. The sixth and seventh floors would carry one-way passenger car traffic, permitting speeds of up to . A reversible roadway, carrying cars in the direction of rush hour traffic, would occupy the eighth and ninth (top) levels. Ramps to the upper car levels would be provided every 15-20 blocks. =Art Society objections= The old elevated highway, looking north towards the bridge over Canal Street The plan was criticized by Thomas Adams, Regional Plan Association director, at the 1927 meeting of the Municipal Art Society. He disapproved of its ugliness and noise, and suggested simply clearing obstructions to the existing surface road to speed traffic. Adams instead supported a comprehensive regional plan for development in the Hudson Valley. The Fine Arts Federation also opposed the highway, saying that elevated structures were unsightly, and that if the existing street were cleared a new highway might not be required. The City Club and New York City Mayor Jimmy Walker objected to the highway on the grounds that it would block waterfront- bound freight traffic. They believed that the plans should wait until the surface railroad tracks were removed in the area, at which point the elevated highway might not be necessary. Parallels were drawn with elevated passenger railroads, which were being torn down at the time; Henry Curran of the City Club called elevated structures \\"a misfit in New York\\". The City Club also objected to more passenger cars in downtown Manhattan. Concerns were raised by the Women's League for the Protection of Riverside Park, which opposed routing trucks through Riverside Park, which would contain a parkway extending from the north end of the planned elevated highway. The League emphasized that commercial traffic should be banned north of 72nd Street (as it currently is on the Henry Hudson Parkway).left Construction The old elevated highway, looking south on the southbound exit ramp for 19th Street, next to the Chelsea Piers. The ramp rising on the right is the southbound entrance ramp from 21st Street. This asymmetrical ramp layout only occurs here, on the first section built Primarily, the Miller Highway consisted of six lanes, supported above the street level on steel columns, which were located at regular intervals (~80 feet) at the outer edges and center of the roadway. Longitudinal strength girders ran between the support columns along the direction of the roadway. The longitudinal girders supported the industrial looking balustrades and the median. Lateral strength girders ran between the support columns across the roadway, and was the location of the expansion joints. Smaller longitudinal and transverse floorbeams formed a lattice structure between major girders to support the road deck. The road deck consisted of reinforced concrete, on top of which the paved surface would sit. Originally this was Belgian block, and was eventually substituted or paved over with asphalt as construction materials matured.https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker- media/image/upload/uxpd0vpeileojpot0i06.jpg Drainage was provided at the expansion joints (on the older sections) or grated channels along the edge of the road (newest sections), with rainwater and snowmelt being plumbed to the street through scuppers and downspouts located at the main support columns. It was not uncommon during the life of the highway that it would be supporting not only traffic, but 6 to 8 inches of standing water. The high impermeable balustrades, the undersized scuppers, and the lack of drain cleaning / maintenance were all ingredients which contributed to the structure's demise. =Canal to 22nd Streets (1929‚Äì1930)= Construction on the first 1.5-mile (2.5 km) section, from Canal Street to 22nd Street, was started on May 24, 1929, and the road was officially opened on November 13, 1930, with some inaugural vehicles using the highway as early as October 28. Traffic was not permitted on the structure until November 17 due to unanticipated delays in cosmetic work. A speed limit of 35 miles per hour (55 km/h) was set by Police Commissioner Edward Mulrooney, and trucks were temporarily banned. On the first Sunday the road was in operation, the northbound roadway was backed up for a mile approaching the north end at 23rd Street. The northbound offramp at 23rd Street, unlike the temporary southbound onramp, was built as a permanent single lane ramp, since in the future most traffic would continue along the not-yet-finished elevated highway. Suggested fixes included a new temporary ramp to 25th Street and conversion of the temporary southbound onramp to two- way traffic. The second Sunday the road was open, rain cut down on the traffic, but police had orders to open the permanent ramp eventually intended for a northbound onramp to exiting northbound traffic if traffic conditions warranted. A temporary wide elevated street was proposed by the city between 29th Street and 37th Street to bypass the New York Central Railroad's 30th Street Yard, to provide relief before the permanent highway was finished. It appears that this temporary viaduct was not built. The original southern terminal for the elevated highway was six lanes wide and was made of stone, complete with winged ornaments and art-deco statuettes. =59th to 72nd Streets (1930‚Äì1932)= The elevated section with abandoned exit ramp that was to be extended to 70th Street The section from 59th Street to 72nd Street was begun in September 1930, and opened to traffic on March 9, 1932. The original configuration fed directly into 72nd Street, with a 90-degree turn in the road. Once the northern extension as a parkway was built, northbound traffic would turn right directly to and from 72nd Street. A southbound left-hand entrance ramp was provided at 72nd Street, with a direct ramp from Riverside Drive (later closed), and a southbound right-hand exit ramp to 70th Street was started, but never completed. Today, the only movement remaining is a northbound entrance to the highway from 72nd Street. The highway from 59th to 72nd Streets is the only elevated section that remains today, although it conflicts with plans for the Riverside South development project and neighborhood. A covered, at-grade replacement road to facilitate a southward expansion of Riverside Park was approved by the Federal Highway Administration in 2001. In June 2006, the developer began construction of a tunnel between 61st and 65th streets for the relocated highway. However, the rest of the tunnel remains unfinished. =22nd to 38th Streets (1932‚Äì1933)= Construction of the elevated highway between 22nd Street and 38th Street was begun on June 21, 1932. The road was opened on January 5, 1933, just before Eleventh Avenue was closed for reconstruction of the NYCRR's 30th Street Yard. =38th to 46th Streets (1933‚Äì1934)= Construction on the highway between 38th Street and 46th Street was begun in late 1933. This section eliminated a busy intersection at 42nd Street, where streetcars and automobiles crossed the corridor to reach the ferry to Weehawken, New Jersey. This link was opened to traffic on August 30, 1934. When the new city piers at 48th Street, 50th Street, and 52nd Street were being planned in late 1934, direct connections between the elevated highway and the second levels of the piers were proposed. Manhattan Borough President Samuel Levy quickly spoke against these connections, citing interference with southbound traffic on the highway. The plan, which had been proposed at the request of several cruise lines, was rejected. In 1935, the 34th Street‚ÄìMidtown Association proposed a new ramp for the highway at 34th Street, having elected new directors for the purpose. This ramp would rise above the elevated railroad and highway, splitting into a northbound onramp and a southbound offramp, both on the right side of the highway. It was hoped that the ramp would help businesses in the area and provide better access to the proposed 38th Street Tunnel (now the Lincoln Tunnel) to New Jersey. The ramp was never built. =46th to 59th Streets (1936‚Äì1937)= Construction on the final section of the originally planned highway, from 46th Street to 59th Street, was begun on February 13, 1936. It was opened to traffic on February 9, 1937, thus completing the elevated highway from Canal Street to 72nd Street. =Duane to Canal Streets (1938‚Äì1939)= Duane Street, where construction was halted during World War II; the highway to the left was built later with a different design. On August 23, 1934, Governor Herbert Lehman signed a bill authorizing construction of a southern extension of the elevated highway from Canal Street to the Battery. However, this segment was opposed by the communities along the route since it might \\"result in a waste of tax funds\\". Construction on the first section of this, from Duane Street to Canal Street, was begun on January 24, 1938. Unlike previous sections of highway, which used granite blocks as a surface, concrete was used on the new section. The road was opened to traffic on February 4, 1939. A steel superstructure consisting of an arched bridge was built at Canal Street because the Holland Tunnel below ground restricted locations of bridge supports. =Barclay to Duane Streets (1947‚Äì1948)= After an extended break due to World War II, construction on the final section of the southern extension, from Carlisle Street to Barclay Street, was begun on April 21, 1947. This section was expanded to reach Duane Street in the north, and was opened on November 29, 1948. =Battery Underpass to Barclay Street (1950‚Äì1951)= The southern end was connected to the Brooklyn‚ÄìBattery Tunnel on May 25, 1950. A four-lane tunnel under Battery Park, the Battery Park Underpass, taking traffic to the South Street Elevated Highway opened on April 10, 1951. 1973 collapse May 1973, seven months before collapse Collapsed section at 14th Street On December 15, 1973, an section of the northbound lanes between Little West 12th Street and Gansevoort Street collapsed under the weight of a dump truck, which was thought to carry over of asphalt for ongoing repairs of the highway. The joints between transverse stringers holding up this section of roadway and the eastern main girder (holding the decorative friezes), failed. A four-door sedan followed the truck through the hole; neither driver was seriously injured. It took hours to back all the traffic off the span trapped behind the collapse. It was later learned that the truck was actually carrying of asphalt, and was overloaded. Blame was assigned to the trucking company, Edenwald Construction Corp. of Whitestone, Queens, but they were still awarded a no-bid contract to clean up the mess. The day after, both directions were closed indefinitely south of 18th Street. This not only closed off the oldest section (between Canal Street and 18th Street), but also the newest sections (south of Canal Street), because ramps south of the collapse only permitted northbound entrances and southbound exits. The southernmost northbound exit was at 23rd Street. The Northbound lanes were closed from the Battery to 48th Street. The Southbound lanes were closed south of 18th Street, with traffic between 42nd Street and 18th Street reduced to one lane.Lakeland Ledger, January 27, 1974 Eventually inspections revealed that the highway south of 46th Street was not structurally sound, and had to be closed to vehicular traffic. The ramps to/from 46th Street were configured as the temporary southern terminal for northbound traffic on the highway, and the ramps to/from 57th Street were configured as the temporary southern terminal for southbound traffic. The segment north of 57th Street carried traffic over the Penn Central Rail yards, and could not be closed as there were no surface streets on which to reroute traffic. This section of Miller Highway remained in use into the 1980s, and has been since rebuilt. Demolition and rehabilitation After the cleanup of the collapsed section at Gansevoort Street, the highway remained standing (closed to traffic), while its fate was decided. The City performed a preliminary survey of the highway after the collapse, and confirmed extreme structural deterioration of connections between the longitudinal girders and transverse floorbeams. The City had not inspected this structure since its opening, and hired Hardesty and Hanover, Consulting Engineers, to perform a full inspection of the roadway in 1974. A four-volume report was delivered to the City, stating that: # Public officials anticipated its early demise as far back as the mid-1950s. # The use of salts to melt ice and snow, combined with heavy traffic and poor drainage, corroded and eroded the deck, of which portions had fallen down into West Street before the major December 1973 collapse. # The structure south of 46th Street should be closed to vehicular traffic until a decision is made to demolish or repair / rehabilitate the structure. Restoration of the structure was feasible, but cost-prohibitive. The Chief Engineer of the New York Highway Department estimated a $58 million cost to partially rehabilitate the structure. Hardesty and Hanover estimated it would cost $66 million (1976 dollars) for a new road deck, median, lighting, painting, and steel repairs. A New York City Highway Department representative estimated that a complete rehabilitation, including modernization, was estimated to cost $88 million. The last option was Westway. The City chose not to pursue rehabilitation of the existing structure because of its level of deterioration, and instead hoped to build an interstate highway between the Battery Tunnel and the Lincoln Tunnel, taking advantage of funding and financing from the Federal Highway Trust Fund (10 cent interstate dollars). The City elected to leave the structure standing, as there was no money available to demolish the structure. Portions were demolished when they became a threat to people or property at ground level or non-city money became available. Federal Westway money was used for the demolition of the elevated structure from 42nd Street south to the Battery and to pave surface streets as a temporary roadway while the battle over Westway continued. The portion of the highway adjacent to the collapse (Jane Street north to 26th Street) came down first, in 1977, and the portion between 26th and 42nd Streets was demolished between November 1981 and the summer of 1982. The highway from Jane Street south to Spring Street was torn down between the spring and fall of 1981, and the highway from Spring Street south to the Battery was torn down between the summer of 1981 and the spring of 1982. The segment from 43rd to 59th Streets was left standing, since it was thought that it could be refurbished and integrated into an extension of Westway. The remaining highway would be funded separately, as interstate funds could not be used to connect an interstate highway to a limited-use facility (in this case, the Henry Hudson Parkway). Ramp and lane improvements were made in 1981, permanently closing the highway south of 59th Street. Previously, northbound traffic could enter the highway at 43rd Street and southbound traffic was directed off the highway at 59th Street. The city demolished the 43rd-59th Street portion by October 1989. Rehabilitation of the elevated structure between 59th Street and 72nd Street was completed in 1995. The only remaining section of the Miller Highway, with lampposts, is an abandoned southbound exit-ramp stub just north of 72nd Street.

Jean Dess√®s (6 August 1904 - 2 August 1970), was a world leading fashion designer in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. His designs reflected the influences of his travels, specializing in creating draped evening gowns in chiffon and mousseline, based on early Greek and Egyptian robes. Biography Born Jean Dimitre Verginie in Alexandria, Egypt, to Greek parents, Dess√®s originally set out to study law, but, in 1925, he abandoned his legal studies and began working for Maison Jane, a Parisian couture house where, in 1937, he opened his own couture salon. After World War II, he traveled extensively throughout the world. His work was influenced by his travels, creating draped evening gowns in chiffon, embroidered dresses, sheath dresses with tight jackets and flowing skirts. His fashion was very popular with European royalty and movie stars. Among his clientele were the Queen and royal princesses of Greece, the Duchess of Windsor, Madame Jean (Lilia) Ralli, the first Mrs. Aristotle Onassis, Athina Livanos, and society hostess Elsa Maxwell. In 1962, he designed the wedding gown worn by Princess Sophia of Greece (later Queen Sofia of Spain) for her marriage to the future King Juan Carlos I of Spain. Valentino worked with Desses for several years in the 1950s and gained much hands-on experience, as did Guy Laroche who in the 1950s was Desses' assistant. In 1963, at age 60, he retired to Greece because of poor health, where he ran a small boutique which he had opened eight years earlier. He died in Athens in 1970. In the 1990s, his fashion designs saw a revival with the interest in vintage dresses. Naomi Campbell wore a vintage boned bodice and ruched silk Desses gown in May 1999 at a Christie's party. Later, in 2001, Ren√©e Zellweger wore a lemon yellow strapless 1950s Dess√®s gown to the Academy Awards. Similarly, Jennifer Lopez wore a vintage moss green Desses gown, made with 50 yards of chiffon, to the 2006 Academy Awards. The fashion designer Jean Dess√®s brought also out a perfume called Kalispera.

According to the legend, the monastery was founded by the first Serb archbishop, Saint Sava in the 13th century. The monastery, often cited as one of the most beautiful, has been nicknamed the \\"Jewel of Baƒçka\\". Considered \\"one of the most monumental cultural-historical objects in Baƒçka\\", it is protected by the state since 4 August 1949 as the cultural monument.  Location  The monastery is located near Kovilj, a suburban village of Novi Sad. It is situated just south of the village at the point where the Special Natural Reserve \\"Koviljsko- Petrovaradinski Rit\\" begins, a wetland in the valley of the Danube, stretched along its left bank. The Monastery Kovilj is in the western section of ≈†ajka≈°ka, a historical region of south Baƒçka.  History  In 1217, Serbian ruler, Grand ≈Ωupan Stefan the First-Crowned was crowned the King of Serbia by the papal legate. King Andrew II of Hungary, angered by the fact that the ruler of Serbia is now equal to him and considering Serbia its vassal, decided to attack Stefan. In 1220, Andrew II encamped at the location of modern Kovilj, which at the time was the territory of Hungary. Saint Sava, brother of Stefan, arrived and began diplomatic talks to prevent the war and managed to reconcile two kings. According to tradition, to commemorate the event, Saint Sava founded the monastery in 1220, and dedicated it to the Saint Archangels Gabriel and Michael. Turkish traveller Evliya √áelebi, who visited the region in the 17th century, wrote that the monastery was founded by the \\"Serbian king, the owner of Belgrade\\", which would be King Stefan Dragutin, who was the only mediaeval Serbian king who ruled Belgrade, 1284-1316. Some theories claim that the monastery was built on the ruins of the Franciscan monastery from 1421. None of these theories can be confirmed in historical documents. Kovilj was mentioned for the first in the Munich Serbian Psalter from the 14th century. It was mentioned as having a \\"joint properties\\" with the Privina Glava Monastery, which indicates that Kovilj was originally a metochion of Privina Glava. Later sources mention the \\"old wooden church\\", which was painted with frescoes in 1651. During the wars between the Austria and Ottoman Empire in the second half of the 17th century, the Ottomans demolished the monastery and burned the church on four occasions from 1686 to 1697. After the Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699, the surviving monks restored the old church, with the help from the other monks and people which settled in the area from the other parts of Hungary, while the monastery was renovated in 1705-1707.Prilog istoriji manastira Kovilja, by Petar Momiroviƒá, 1993 The present, stone church, was built from 1741 to 1749 by the neimars (builders) Teodor Kosta and Nikola Krapiƒá. It was built in the Morava architectural school style of Serbo- Byzantine architecture and patterned after Manasija and Ravanica. In 1758, Empress Maria Theresa issued a document which set the monastery's estate. By the imperial privilege, the land was strictly divided between the monastery and the nearby settlement of Koviljski ≈†anac. The establishment of the ≈†ajka≈° Battalion in 1763, Serbian settlements surrounding the monastery were repopulated and preserved, which also influenced the prosperity of the monastery. Forerunner of the modern Serbian historiography, Jovan Rajiƒá, became a priest in Kovilj and was appointed the archimandrite of the monastery in 1772, where he died in 1801. During the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, the rebels used the monastery as their base in 1849 which forced the monks to move across the Danube, into the Syrmia region. When they returned after the collapse of the rebellion, the monastery was looted and burned, and many historical treasures have been lost. The new church damaged inside while the old one was almost completely ruined, so it was demolished in 1850. Since 1850, the monks began to collect funds for the restoration. Some of it was secured by the Austrian state, some by the donations of the population and some was help from Russia. Young painter Aksentije Marodiƒá has painted the new iconostas in the 1880s, including the scenes from the life of Christ and replicas of the most famous paintings from that period which Marodiƒá copied from the galleries in Vienna, Munich, Paris, Rome, Venice, and Naples. The walls themselves are not painted. Woodworks and carvings are work of Jovan Kisner, while the gold plating and marble work were done by Ludvig Tau≈°. The work on the interior turned out to be quite lengthy, as it lasted until 1891/92. Marodiƒá painted iconostasis contrary to the canons of the Orthodox faith. Trained in Italy, he was heavily influenced by the Renaissance. Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper is not being painted in Orthodox churches but Marodiƒá painted it in the prominent, central position. Other non-canonical deviations include lack of the visible halos around the saints' heads, there are no names of the saint on the icons, God was painted in human form and there are representations of the Holy Trinity and the Coronation of the Virgin. The frescoes on the walls and columns, on the other hand, followed the church canons. The monastery wasn't damaged during World War I. After the partial agrarian reform in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the estate of Kovilj was reduced, and in 1933 it became a female monastery. The Hungarian occupational forces looted the monastery in 1941, during World War II, and some artifacts are today still being exhibited in several museums in Budapest. They also expelled the nuns, which moved to the Fenek Monastery, but when Usta≈°e forced them out from Fenek, too, they settled in the Monastery of Saint Petka, near Paraƒáin, in central Serbia. After the war ended, the new Communist authorities confiscated almost the entire monastic estate. Part of the complex is a small chapel dedicated to Saint Petka. It leans on an oak, which is in 2010 estimated to be 600 years old.  Treasury  Iconostasis After the 1850 renovation, the monastery gathered a vast new artistic and historical collection. It includes rare and valuable books and manuscripts which are kept in large monastic library, the paintings of Uro≈° Prediƒá and Rafailo Momƒçiloviƒá, the collection of musical literature (assembled by Damaskin Davidoviƒá, numerous icons from the 18th and 19th centuries, the monastic archive, etc. The monastery also has the spacious rooms and salons equipped with the antique furniture, chandeliers, stoves, etc., but also a modern dining rooms and an ophthalmology cabinet. There is also a tomb of Jovan Rajiƒá and his original works can be found in his memorial museum.  Economy  Kovilj is known for its honey and rakia. In the process of restitution, the state returned to the monastery previously nationalized of arable land and of forests. As of 2017, a brotherhood of 30 monks cultivates some . They keep 200 bee hives and produce a famed white basil honey (from Stachys annua L.). The monastery produces a variety of brandies made of quince, plums, green nuts but also cognac and walnut liqueur. The monastery produces of brandy per year. Other activities include production of candles and crafting of icons, which, together with numerous herbal balms, can be bought in the monastic shop. The monastery gained media attention due to the airing of the Bukvar pravoslavlja (the \\"Primer of Orthodoxy\\"), from 1996 to 2007. The episodes were shot in Kovilj and they were hosted and edited by then hegumen of the monastery, Porfirije Periƒá. The monastery also has a choir, noted for its Byzantine chanting.  Land of the living  From the first mentions of the monastery, there was a monastic school in it. In 2004, heguman Porfirije decided to change the purpose of the object and adapted it into the drug rehabilitation center for young drug addicts, within his project Zemlja ≈æivih (\\"Land of the living\\"). The project expanded beyond the monastery so in 2006 a community was formed on the sala≈° in ƒåenej, and then houses were opened in the villages of Vilovo and Brajkovac.

History The name derives from its shape, which resembles a millrind, the iron clamp of the upper millstone, moline being the Old French for a mill. It is very similar to one of the varieties of the \\"fer de moline\\" heraldic charge (literal French: \\"iron of a mill\\"), the forked tips of which, however, circle out slightly more, akin to the \\"cross recercelee\\". It is borne both inverted and rebated, and sometimes \\"saltirewise\\" (i.e. in the form of a saltire). When used as a mark of cadency it signifies an eighth son. The cross moline is associated with St. Benedict of Nursia. As a result, it is widely used as an emblem by the monks and nuns of the Order of St. Benedict, which he founded. Examples Canting arms of Molyneux: Azure, a cross moline or Templar cross moline Crosses moline appear most notably in the arms of the following: *Families: **Molyneux, a mediaeval Anglo-Norman family, Earl of Sefton, Viscount Molyneux, Molyneux baronets, etc. A famous example of canting arms: Azure, a cross moline or (Burke's Armorials, 1884) **the House of Broglie *Institutions: **The University of Nottingham *Modern examples: **Knowsley Metropolitan Borough Council **Selby District Council **Huyton-with-Roby Urban District Council **North Warwickshire Borough Council **My Chemical Romance used a cross moline for MCRX.

Samuell High School and Early College is a public secondary school located in the Pleasant Grove area of Dallas, Texas, US. Samuell High enrolls students in grades 9‚Äì12 and is a part of the Dallas Independent School District. The school serves portions of southeast Dallas and a portion of the city of Balch Springs. In 2015, the school was rated \\"Met Standard\\" by the Texas Education Agency.  History  Dallas ISD annexed Pleasant Grove ISD in 1954, and Pleasant Grove High School (now John Quincy Adams Elementary School) was replaced by the newly constructed Samuell High School in 1956-57. In the 1950s and early 1960s, a number of new housing developments in the Pleasant Grove area made Samuell one of Dallas' largest high schools; a new wing was opened in the mid-1960s to handle the increase in population. H. Grady Spruce and Skyline high schools, two historical rivals and closest schools to Samuell, were opened in 1963 and 1971 to help reduce attendance. Dr. William Worthington Samuell was a wealthy individual who before his death donated millions of dollars to the City of Dallas Parks and Recreation Department. There are now at least six institutions named after Dr. Samuell in the Dallas area, including the high school, a boulevard, a City of Dallas ranch, a city park and two streets in bordering cities. Dr. W. W. Samuell purchased the first ambulance for the City of Dallas in 1911. The school and the district became the focus of a prominent civil rights case in 1966 when three male students -- Paul Jarvis, Phil Ferrell and Steve Webb -- sued the district after they were ordered to cut their long hair in order to be admitted to school. The case was one of the first in which individuals sued a large urban school district to preserve their individual rights, and the cause was taken up by the American Civil Liberties Union as well as local retail pioneer Stanley Marcus. Marcus did not know the students, but saw their hairstyles as a fashion choice rather than a show of disregard for authority. The case was lost in the U.S. District Court, and despite a series of appeals leading to the U.S. Supreme Court, it was not overturned. The decision is still cited in court cases over constitutional rights.Michael E. Young. \\"In '66, their hair triggered a to-do: Stylish Marcus proved an ally in band's battle to keep long locks,\\" The Dallas Morning News, March 4, 2002. Student life The alma mater is \\"Hail Samuell High, Hail Samuell High\\", written in 1955 by a music teacher at the school. The school yearbook is The Torch and the school newspaper is The Sentinel. For many years, the seniors' annual memory book was The Senior Pub, a publication of senior moments which covered all levels of the school, from classroom funnies to athletics to activities.

It is an adaptation of a play of the same name by Fernando Arrabal, who was working with Jodorowsky on performance art at the time. The film was shot in high-contrast black-and-white on the weekends with a small budget and was first shown at the Acapulco Film Festival in 1968. Plot The film follows Fando (Sergio Klainer) and his paraplegic girlfriend Lis (Diana Mariscal) through a barren, postapocalyptic wasteland in search of the mythical city of Tar, a place where one will know the true nature of eternity, and reach enlightenment. On their journey they see many odd and profoundly disturbing characters and events. The narrative of the film leaves a lot to the audience's interpretation, as the avant-garde and surreal nature in which the events of the film are presented mimic the workings of the subconscious. Release Fando y Lis premiered at the 1968 Acapulco film festival.When the film premi√®red at the festival, a full-scale riot broke out.Rosenbaum, 1992. p.92 The film was later banned in Mexico.Rosenbaum, 1992. p.93 The film was shown in New York 's 5th Avenue Cinema where it was dubbed, re-edited and cut by 13 minutes. The film was shown in London, England in February 1971 and was re-titled Tar Babies, running 98 minutes. It was not released in Mexico until July 1972. The film has received a 4K digital restoration and is set to be re-released in UK cinemas by Abkco Films for a limited time commencing on February 7, 2020.

From the start of his career, his art has revolved around production and the ways in which an artist relates to the broad culturally-injected concept of Modernism. In 2003 Jan De Cock entered the competition Prix de la Jeune Peinture Belge (Prize for Young Belgian Painters). He is, after Luc Tuymans, only the second Belgian artist to have had a solo exposition at Tate Modern and the first living Belgian artist to have an exhibition at MoMA, which opened on 23 January 2008. Much of his work appears to draw visual and formal comparisons between early-20th century abstract art movements (such as Constructivism, Cubism, and Suprematism) and contemporary design and mass production. Additionally, de Cock commonly includes a performative element intended to act as social critique or to place his work demonstrably into a system of exchange. He is represented by Office Baroque in Brussels, Belgium, Fons Welters in Amsterdam, and Francesca Minini in Milan.  Art projects  Abstract Capitalism II, at The Brussels Art_ Institute, Brussels =The Brussels Art_ Institute= Jan De Cock is founder of The Brussels Art_ Institute (BAI), a multidisciplinary artist workspace and cooperation between the artist and school of Sint-Lukas, Brussels. The institute is located in Anderlecht along the Zenne and Brussels-South station. =Abstract Capitalism= Series of exhibitions, taking place in 2015 and 2016 at the gallery of Office Baroque in Brussels. The latter exhibition featured 18 new ‚ÄúAbstract Capitalist‚Äù sculptures as well as 9 ‚ÄúMemorial‚Äù drawings. In December 2016 Abstract Capitalism II opened at The Brussels Art_ Institute, a 'memorial exhibition' in the form of an old school salon, revealing how artists' houses and studios have become the object of public fascination and - at the same time - misunderstanding about art, creator and the aesthetic. It entails a series of 124 studies of homages to the idea of the arcade and the studio. Grocery store owner posing with an engine cleaner, Everything For You, Mexico City 2013 =Everything For You= This series of exhibitions tackles the concept of the free market. The first edition Everything For You, Mexico City opened in the spring of 2013 in Galer√≠a Hilario Galguera, in Mexico City. Jan De Cock grants the city a number of different sculptural Gifts, with which he rejects today's supply-and-demand economy by giving the inhabitants of the city a gift pur sang, voluntarily and in places where no one has asked for them. Before the Gifts are exhibited, they are first activated in the city by means of a photographic portrait. These photos are then printed in a Memorial Paper, accompanied by two essays and photographs of other cities, and spread over the city. Twenty cities are featured in this project, including Mexico City, Otegem, Strombeek, Havana, Kiev, Carrara, Belfast, Hong Kong, Herford, Liverpool, Casablanca, Antwerp, Godarville, New York, Tokyo, Paris and Brussels. Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Romantik VIII 2012 Steel, chipboard, melamine, pinewood, veneer, wenge, plaster, paint, acrylic dispersion paint, photograph on paper, copper 271 x 73 x 272 cm - Collection of Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam (Netherlands) = Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Staatliche Kunsthalle Baden-Baden, Germany, 2011 = Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis (or JKO) is the encompassing generic term for the exhibition project. The project took place between September 2011 and June 2012 and can be divided into two separate but interrelated parts. Part 1: A series of six Cahiers was published as a periodical picture story to mark the project. White-out Studio systematically exhibited the Cahiers as five different presentations that were spread over a period of five months (September 10, 2011- January 31, 2012). Part 2 : The Staatliche Kunsthalle Baden-Baden subsequently presented the exhibition Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis (March 10, 2012 - June 24, 2012) and the catalogue 'Jan De Cock: Handbuch Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Eine Romantische Austellung'. In this exhibition Jan De Cock unfolds a complex, interlocking system of fragments, changing the white rooms of the Kunsthalle and the glass pavilion of the Stadtmuseum into a landscape of splintered units that seemingly has no point of departure, nor one of arrival. The works shown in the exhibition were made using industrially produced materials. A series of sculptures entitled Romantische Skulpturen consists of grand steel profile frames measuring almost 3m x 3m, upon which precisely crafted layers of coated wood and other materials have been attached. The works bring to mind expansive objects from former series by Jan De Cock, that now seem to have been shoved against the wall. In other words, entire rooms have been transformed into layered reliefs. For De Cock, the layering and unkempt surfaces are again references to his studio process. Palais des Beaux Arts, 2009, REPROMOTION = Repromotion, BOZAR, Brussels, 2009 = This exhibition was sculptured and organized within its space as a sequence from a fictional film. Jan De Cock probed the very sources of film and played with movement, repetition, and reproduction, which are the main concepts for reading the exhibition. The montage took place from room to room, following a directed path, indicated by three Herculean archers by the sculptor Antoine Bourdelle. With Repromotion, the artist examined the issue of representing movement in modern sculpture or \\"the development of the artist studio in space\\". Jan De Cock chose BOZAR because of his personal relationship to the institution. Denkmal 11, Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53 Street, New York, 2008 = Denkmal 11, Museum of Modern Art, West 53 Street, New York, 2008 = Jan De Cock's first US museum exhibition took place in 2008. A multipart installation features a complex display of framed images punctuated by boxlike plywood modules. Photographs and photomontages in austere black frames are clustered on the walls, some as high as the ceiling or as low as the floor. In some of these groupings, smaller photographs are arranged on white backgrounds. Others are partly obscured by white mats with peekaboo cutouts, or by sculptural interventions in the form of slotted plywood boxes. The photographic material was created in response to the specific location in which it will be screened, and shows different objects from the collection of the MoMA, in combination with images from art, architecture or film history. Denkmal 4, Casa del Fascio, Piazza del Popolo 4, Como, 2006 = Denkmal 4, Casa del Fascio, Piazza del Popolo 4, Como, 2006 = In 2006 Jan De Cock created a series of in-situ sculptures in Casa del Fascio that entered into dialogue with the existing architectural shapes of two different locations in the region of Lombardy in Northern Italy: the gallery Francesca Minini in Milan and Galleria Massimo Minini in Brescia. Daniel Buren was then invited to elaborate in-situ on the museum reference frame created by De Cock, and hence to complete the work. Buren's intervention consisted of putting his well-known motive of green vertical ( 8.7 cm ) wide stripes onto De Cock's sculptures and using mirrors to interact with the piece. = Denkmal 53, Tate Modern, London, 2005 = With Denkmal 53, Jan De Cock built his own museum by creating simple constructions that refer to the formal language of the building of Tate Modern, especially the window distribution and structure of the Central Hall. The installation uses vistas and blind walls to redirect the viewer's gaze and hide certain aspects of an existing edifice to reveal others. Randschade Fig. 7 / Collateral Damage Fig. 7, Museum voor Schone Kunsten en S.M.A.K. Gent, 2002 = Randschade Fig.7 / Collateral Damage Fig.7, Museum Fine Arts and S.M.A.K., Ghent, 2002 = This exhibition was conceived as an orchestrated walking tour with pauses and hindrances: the sculptures in the middle of the rooms are spread over different exhibition spaces, thus reducing the available space and creating a trajectory past the old masters that sometimes leads to a dead-end. The lines, areas, and solid colours of the sculptures harmonize on an abstract level with the furnishings, the architecture, and the paintings, resulting in a Gesamtkunstwerk. = Vertigo or the Era of Free Catalogues, Part 2, Felix Hap Park, Brussels, 2000 = This installation was created for the group exhibition Beeld in Park in 2000 (June 30, 2000 - October 15, 2000) for which Jan De Cock created a new entrance, namely the carriage entry of a private residence that opened onto the public space of the Jean-F√©lix Hap Park. The pavilion was built as an extension of the new entrance, adjacent to an 18th- century gateway building in the classical style.

It runs east to west connecting the State Dining Room with the East Room. The room is used for receiving lines following a State Arrival Ceremony on the South Lawn, or a procession of the President and a visiting head of state and their spouses. The space measures just under 18 by 80 feet (5.5 by 24 m). It allows access to the elevator vestibule, Entrance Hall, East Room, Blue Room, Green Room, Red Room, and State Dining Room. The Grand Staircase is visible from an opening directly across from the Green Room.  Architecture and furnishings  The current architectural appearance dates to the 1952 Truman reconstruction, which recreated much of the 1902 renovation by the firm of McKim, Mead and White. The Truman reconstruction replaced the golden-hued Joliet stone floors, columns and pilasters with a cool gray marble. Plaster walls divided by a dado and painted cream and gold were also replaced with marble. McKim employed Roman doric columns based directly on the work of the sixteenth-century Italian architect Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola for the screen separating the cross hall and entrance hall. James Hoban's niches in the south wall were retained although their exterior trim was made less overt. Although Hoban had urn-shaped cast-iron stoves placed in them, the current niches contain busts of Presidents George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. During the Kennedy Administration restoration, interior decorator St√©phane Boudin arranged the furnishings to more closely resemble the cross hall at Malmaison. While a red carpet has traditionally been in the Cross Hall since the early 1960s, the carpet has, over time, become more detailed and the color has evolved. The current carpet, manufactured during the Clinton Administration, was designed to be more graphic, and to appear attractively in television broadcasts. The red was made more saturated, the shade slightly warmer, and a gold border of laurel leaves, medallions, and five-pointed stars, based directly on the carved stone border in the Grand Stairway, was woven into the carpet's border. The current appearance of the Cross Hall is the result of a renovation and refurbishing completed in 1997 by the Committee for the Preservation of the White House, the White House Office of the Curator, and funded by the White House Endowment Trust. A suite of upholstered gilded beech chairs and sett√©es thought to have once belonged to James Monroe are arranged against the walls; two Empire pier tables are placed opposite the Madison suite of furniture and the gilded pier table from Monroe's original purchase for the Blue Room and restored by Jacqueline Kennedy is in the adjacent Entrance Hall.  History  The tradition of hanging presidential portraits in this hall dates to President Ulysses S. Grant. The Buchanan administration first began the tradition of keeping paintings of presidents for the White House collection. The Grants added to this collection, and hung portraits of presidents from Washington to Lincoln in the Cross Hall behind a glass screen. At that time, visitors could come to the White House on weekdays, enter through the north doors, and walk down the Cross Hall past the paintings to the East Room. With a note from a congressman, visitors could view the other \\"State Floor\\" rooms, such as the Red Room, where they could see the large Grant family portrait.

It introduces George Smiley, the most famous of le Carr√©'s recurring characters, in a story about East German spies inside Great Britain. It also introduces a fictional version of British Intelligence, called \\"the Circus\\" because of its location in Cambridge Circus, that is apparently based on MI6 and that recurs throughout le Carr√©'s spy novels. Call for the Dead was filmed as The Deadly Affair, released in 1966. Plot summary Foreign Office civil servant Samuel Fennan apparently commits suicide after a routine security check by Circus agent George Smiley. Smiley had interviewed and cleared Fennan only days previously after an anonymous accusation; because of this, Circus head of service Maston sets up Smiley to be blamed for Fennan's death. While interviewing Fennan's wife Elsa in her home, Smiley answers the telephone, expecting the call to be for him. It is a requested 8:30 AM call from the telephone exchange. Inspector Mendel, a police officer on the verge of retirement who is investigating the Fennan case, finds out that the call had been requested by Fennan the night before. When Elsa later tells Smiley that she requested the call from the exchange, Smiley becomes suspicious of her. However, Maston unequivocally orders Smiley to refrain from any further investigation into Fennan's death. Back in his office, Smiley receives a letter posted by Fennan the night before, requesting an urgent meeting that day. Believing that Fennan was murdered to prevent the meeting, Smiley resigns from the Circus and attaches his resignation to Fennan's letter, which he forwards to Maston. Arriving home, Smiley notices a movement in the drawing room. He rings his own door bell and is met by a tall, fair, handsome stranger. Smiley skilfully avoids entering and notes all the number plates of the seven cars parked in the road. Mendel traces one car to a car dealer, Adam Scarr. Scarr tells Mendel that he rents the car out twice a month to a stranger known as \\"Blondie\\", whose description matches Smiley's intruder. Smiley is subsequently attacked and nearly killed while trying to track the car to \\"Blondie\\", and Scarr is later murdered. Investigating further, Mendel learns that Elsa attends a local theatre twice a month with \\"Blondie\\", and that the two exchange music cases at each performance. \\"Blondie\\" is soon identified by fellow Circus agent Peter Guillam as Hans-Dieter Mundt, an East German agent under diplomatic cover working for Dieter Frey, a German spy of Smiley's during the Second World War who has since become an important East German agent. Smiley believes that Frey would use a courier like Mundt to service only one highly placed resident agent. Guillam reports that Mundt has fled England. When confronted with Smiley's evidence, Elsa confesses to Smiley that her husband was an East German spy, that she was his unwilling accomplice in passing secret documents in the music cases, and that Fennan was killed by Mundt after Frey saw him talking to Smiley. However, Guillam learns that during the last six months, Fennan had been taking home insignificant, unclassified documents. Smiley realises that Elsa herself is the East German spy and that Fennan had accused himself to meet someone with whom he could discuss his suspicions about his wife. Smiley sets a trap, using his knowledge of Frey's tradecraft from the war to inspire a rendezvous between Frey and Elsa. When Frey utilises the meeting to kill Elsa, he is trailed by Mendel and killed by Smiley while attempting to escape. Smiley turns down Maston's offer of reinstatement and promotion and instead flies to Zurich to see his estranged wife, Ann.

It features George Smiley, the most famous of le Carr√©'s recurring characters, in his only book set outside the espionage community. Plot summary Retired spy George Smiley is contacted by a wartime colleague, Miss Elsa Brimley, who now edits a small Christian magazine, Christian Voice. She tells Smiley that she has received a letter from a reader, Stella Rode, claiming that her husband is plotting to kill her. The woman's husband is a teacher at a public school in the town of Carne. It so happens that Terence Fielding, brother of a classics professor who was one of Smiley's close associates in British intelligence during the war, is a house master at the school. However, before Smiley can intervene, Stella Rode is murdered. Since Stella's father and ancestors had been long time subscribers of the magazine, Brimley feels obligated and guilty over the woman's death, asks Smiley for help, with whom she had worked during the war as his secretary. Smiley travels to Carne to investigate. Smiley's estranged wife Ann had lived in Carne as a child, and upon his arrival, he becomes the subject of snide gossip. He also is a witness to an invidious class division between \\"town and gown\\" which is superimposed upon a religious division between adherents of the Church of England and Nonconformists. As the wife of a public school teacher, and as a nonconformist, Stella Rode occupied a low rank in the local social hierarchy, especially in the estimation of Carne's upper crust. The town police focus on a homeless madwoman as the murderer, but both Smiley and the investigating officer believe her to be innocent. Ms. Brimley discovers the murderer's hidden blood-stained clothes, while in the meantime Tim Perkins, a boy in Fielding's house, becomes the second murder victim. Stanley Rode admits to Smiley that, behind her apparent piety and ostentatious good works, his murdered wife was a pathological liar and schemer who would emotionally abuse him and viciously beat her own dog. Digging deeper, Smiley learns that Stella habitually humiliated, blackmailed, and otherwise terrorized those around her, using both her mask of civility and a fear of reprisals to escape suspicion or retribution for her behavior. Smiley follows the clues to identify the real murderer, Terence Fielding, whom Stella had been blackmailing over his wartime conviction of homosexual conduct with a member of the Royal Air Force. The conviction was known to school authorities, who took advantage of the situation for their own ends with separate blackmail of Fielding into remaining in his position at a significantly lower salary than his peers. Perkins had inadvertently made a discovery that would derail Fielding's attempt to implicate the husband and would have put suspicion on Fielding himself. Instead, until the end Fielding maintained unawareness of the significance of what he had seen. Fielding ultimately fails to frame the husband for the murders, despite his attempt to misdirect Smiley by saying he loved Perkins. Having admitted his guilt, Fielding is arrested. Television and radio adaptations John le Carr√© himself adapted the novel for Thames Television. A Murder of Quality was shown on the ITV network in 1991. It stars Denholm Elliott as George Smiley, Glenda Jackson as Ailsa Brimley, Joss Ackland as Terence Fielding, Billie Whitelaw as Mad Janie, David Threlfall as Stanley Rode and a teenage Christian Bale as Tim Perkins. The novel was read on BBC Radio 4's Story Time in 1976, and dramatised on the same station in 1981. More recently, in 2009, BBC Radio 4 broadcast A Murder of Quality as the second in a series which featured all the Smiley novels (The Complete Smiley), with Simon Russell Beale in the main role.BBC Genome Project - Radio Times listings  References  External links * 1962 British novels Novels adapted into television shows Novels by John le Carr√© Victor Gollancz Ltd books ","title":"A Murder of Quality"},{"id":"5023769","text":"The Boƒëani Monastery (, ) is a Serbian Orthodox monastery in the Baƒçka region, in the northern Serbian province of Vojvodina. The monastery is near the village of Boƒëani, in the Baƒç municipality. Among the few Serbian Orthodox monasteries in the Baƒçka, Boƒëani is the oldest.  History  The monastery was founded in 1478. According to myth, Bogdan, a merchant from Dalmatia, was travelling in the area when he got blind. In the vicinity of the Danube he stopped, washed his eyes at the nearby spring and his sight returned. As a gratitude, he built a monastery and dedicated it to the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In time, the monastery was named after him (Bogdan - Boƒëani). The church has been demolished and rebuilt several times. It was damaged in wars, burned in fires and flooded during the major floods of the Danube, like in the late 18th century or 1920s, when the church was flooded by water up to high. The existing church was built in 1722. After the last major reconstruction, a glass plate was installed in front of the altar, so that archaeological remains of the previous churches can be seen. For a short period in the first half of the 1990s, Boƒëani became a female monastery.  Characteristics  The monastery complex consists of the Church of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, konaks which surround the church from three sides shaped like a Cyrillic letter \\"–ü\\", a garden and an estate with auxiliary objects. The church is built in the Baroque style. It is known for its frescoes, the work of Hristofor ≈Ωefaroviƒá, a translator of the Leonardo Da Vinci's A Treatise on Painting in the Greek language, who painted them in the 1730s. They cover over of space. Instead of working with the wet plaster, which is one of the main characteristics of the frescoes, ≈Ωefaroviƒá used the oil paint on dry plaster. The presentation of the Biblical themes is also unusual and differs from the usual ones. He gave his interpretation, which was opposite to the canonical versions, so some consider his work as the spark of the modern Serbian painting. The semicircular supporting pillars are painted with the Book of Genesis motives, while to roof frescoes depict battles between the saints and demons, which have strange, animal-like heads. Saint Margaret the Virgin, in Serbian called Ognjena Marija (\\"Fiery Mary\\"), is shown bludgeoning the animal-like, winged and tailed demon with a hammer. Iconostasis is a superb work of art of its own. It was made in the mid-18th century by an artisan from Kiev. Boƒëani Monastery was declared Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1990, and it is protected by Republic of Serbia. The monastery garden is popular among the local population and visitors. It has over 150 different plants from all parts of the world, like Egyptian cedar or numerous plants from the Americas. A project of planting the sequoia trees turned unsuccessful due to the climate.

It primarily serves students in Washington's Ward 3, although nearly 30% of the student body live outside the school‚Äôs boundaries. The school building, built in 1935 and extensively renovated in 2010‚Äì2011, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2010. The school was named for Woodrow Wilson, the 28th president of the United States.

In March 1934, the D.C. commissioners awarded the contract to build Wilson to the lowest bidder, McCloskey and Co of Philadelphia. It was built for a total cost of $1.25 million. Wilson opened its doors to students on Monday, September 23, 1935, as an all-white school, thus becoming the sixth DC Interhigh school. The school started with 640 sophomores and juniors. Many students transferred to Wilson from Central and Western. Western had been running double shifts (9 am ‚Äì 5 pm) to accommodate the students from the Wilson neighborhoods. The first principal was Norman J. Nelson, who had previously been the assistant principal at Western. Woodrow Wilson High School graduated its first students in February 1937. Chester Moye was class president from the February graduation class. The new school held its first spring commencement exercises, on June 23, 1937, for 290 students. The class president was Robert Davidson. =Subsequent years= In the spring of 1970 about 400 students gathered in the school auditorium to protest inequalities in the school, and almost all of the students were black. Jay Childers, the author of The Evolving Citizen: American Youth and the Changing Norms of Democratic Engagement (2012), wrote that this was an indication of racial tension in the school.Jay Childers, The Evolving Citizen: American Youth and the Changing Norms of Democratic Engagement (2012) p. 48. Dr. Stephen P. Tarason became the school's 11th principal in January 1999, when he succeeded Dr. Wilma Bonner. Dr. Bonner spent a brief time working at the DCPS office before moving on to a position at the Howard University School of Education. In mid-2006, Woodrow Wilson High School was proposed to be a charter school, but the superintendent asked the school to hold off in exchange for being granted control over certain areas of autonomy especially facilities. Upon Tarason's departure to become a middle school principal in Hagerstown, Maryland, Mrs. Jacqueline Williams became interim principal in 2007.

Officials said the city wants a replacement by the end of the 2020 year which is estimated to cost 1.2 million dollars. Demographics The school serves 1,829 students. Wilson is the largest comprehensive public high school in the District. The Beacon, the school newspaper, described the school as \\"an integrated school, an unusual, precious, fragile organism, attacked from many sides\\" in December 1970. In 1955 99% of the students at Wilson were white, and by the late 1960s the school was still predominately white. A racial integration campaign occurred in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The school was 17% white by 1980. The current racial makeup of the student body is 34% white, 32% black, 22% Hispanic/Latino, 6% Asian, and 5% multiple races. By 2012 there had been a decline in students from wealthier families; by then many alternative options for schooling had appeared in the DCPS system. Campus The campus includes an Olympic sized swimming pool, theater space, and a large atrium. There is a turf football field behind the school, surrounded by a running track, which is closer in length to 350 meters than the standard 400. Attendance boundary Wilson primarily serves students in Ward 3. School boundaries encompass everything west of 16th Street, NW; all of southwest Washington north of the Anacostia River; and parts of Capitol Hill southeast. Neighborhoods include Adams Morgan, Georgetown, Glover Park, Chevy Chase, and Tenleytown.\\"High School Boundary Map \\" (2016-2017 School Year). District of Columbia Public Schools.

Those students come from all parts of the District. In all, students come to Wilson from 40 different schools in the city. Many of the students live in poor neighborhoods near Wilson. The neighborhood surrounding Wilson has a median family income of over $80,000 as of 2012. The school's student body is ethnically mixed: 32% African American, 34% Caucasian, 22% Latin American, and 6% Asian American. Nearly 22% of the students receive free and reduced lunch benefits. Curriculum and student performance Woodrow Wilson High School is the top performer in the non-magnet High School system in the District of Columbia Public Schools system and one of the top performers in DCPS overall. Students are required to complete 24 credits for graduation, including courses in Art, English, Health and Physical Education, Mathematics through Calculus, Music, Science, Social Studies, and World Languages. Many Wilson students enroll in advanced courses; as of 2015 Wilson has one of the largest numbers of Advanced Placement courses and electives in DCPS. In the 2012-2013 school year, Wilson had a 50% rate of scoring 3-5 in Advanced Placement courses Out-of-boundary students must maintain minimum GPAs in order to remain at the school: 2.5 for students in an academy and 2.0 for students not in an academy. Many Wilson students, about 55% of the student body in the 2013-2014 school year, are members of \\"academies\\" that seek to tailor a student's curriculum to his or her academic and/or professional interests. These include the Finance Academy, HAM (Humanities, Arts, and Media), WISP (Wilson International Studies Program), JROTC, Hospitality and Tourism, AAA (Academic Athletic Achievement), and SciMaTech (Science, Math, and Technology). About 89% of Wilson graduates continue their education beyond high school, with 77% attending two-year or four-year colleges or universities. Extracurricular activities =Athletics= Athletics begin at Wilson During its first school year in 1935‚Äì36, Wilson was not eligible to play in the Inter-High School Athletic Association. The newly formed basketball and baseball teams played an exhibition-only schedule the first year, and there was no football team. The basketball and baseball teams began their official Inter-High Series competition in the 1936‚Äì'37 school year. The football team played an exhibition season in 1936-37 and then officially joined the Inter-High Series, a year later, in the fall of 1937. Coach Carl Heintel coached the Wilson baseball, basketball, and football teams. Wilson was frequently called \\"the Presidents\\" by newspaper sports writers in the early years. Baseball On April 20, 1937, the Wilson baseball team scored an 8‚Äì3 victory at Central Stadium in the school's first-ever major sport Inter-High win. Wilson pitching ace Kilmer Bortz, with his \\"befuddling drop\\" pitch, struck out sixteen Central High School batters. In the spring of 1937, two baseball players were honored as Wilson's first ever All High selections in a major sport: 1B Bill Hawksworth for batting .500 and \\"whose play around the base was a thing of beauty,\\" and strikeout phenom Bortz. Bortz would later become a highly decorated World War II Navy aviator in the Pacific, including being awarded two Navy Cross medals for his actions during the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Wilson finished the 1959 season with a perfect record of 18‚Äì0 and won their first Inter-High baseball championship. Sherman Rees coached the team. In the final game of the season, the Tigers defeated Coolidge 8‚Äì1 at Griffith Stadium; lefty Sam Swindells (8‚Äì0) pitched, and SS Marty Gorewitz batted 4 for 4. Swindells would go on to be named the Daily News 1960 Baseball Player of the Year. The 1962 Tigers, now coached by Bill Richardson, played their way back to the Inter-High Championship game. Wilson curveball ace Kent Feddeman's extra inning 4-hit victory over Anacostia earned Wilson the right to play for another championship. Three days later, they defeated a strong Phelps team 1‚Äì0 in extra innings at Georgetown University. Feddeman pitched again, defeating Phelps pitcher Ed Cook despite Cook's 2-hitter. Key to the victory was the solid defense of Wilson SS Pete Swindells. By 2008, the Tigers had won sixteen consecutive DCIAA baseball championships. At the end of that school year, Coach and AD Eddie Saah retired from coaching with seventeen years at the helm of the Wilson baseball program. Former Assistant Coach Eddie Smith was named as the new baseball coach. Through their 2011 season, the Wilson baseball program won nineteen consecutive DCIAA championships. Even more remarkable, Wilson's last DCIAA loss was in 1999, in a game against Dunbar High School. Basketball Wilson's basketball teams played an exhibition-only schedule in Wilson's first year, 1935-36. Their first official Inter-High Series games took place in the 1936‚Äì37 school year. In the next year of competition ‚Äì the 1937‚Äì38 season ‚Äì Charles Findley was named Wilson's first All High for basketball. (This selection followed two Wilson baseball players in spring of 1937 and a football player in fall of 1937.) Wilson's first Inter-High Championship win was in basketball, in 1942. The squad was coached by Tony Kupka and led by Donald Hillock and Fred Vinson, both of whom were named to the All High team. In the semifinals, Wilson won 28‚Äì24 over the Roosevelt team under coach Red Auerbach. The \\"Green Tigers\\" then decisively won the Inter-High title by beating Central, 46‚Äì23. Wilson won back-to-back Inter-High championship titles in 1953 and 1954. In 1952-53, the top scorer was Lon Herzbrun. In one game against McKinley Tech, Herzbrun scored 41 points ‚Äì breaking the Inter-High single game scoring record. Herzbrun also broke the Inter-High single season scoring record, and this win ended Tech's run of 30 consecutive victories. That same year, Tennessee bound Herzbrun was named to the first team All Met football team and the first team All Met basketball team, the only Wilson athlete ever to earn that double honor. In Wilson's 1953-54 basketball year, sophomore Lew Luce led the team in scoring; he broke Herzbrun's Inter-High single season scoring record on the final day of the 1954 regular season. Luce went on to be named three times to the All Met basketball team. Football Wilson's inaugural football team, coached by Carl Heintel, played its first (exhibition season) game on October 16, 1936, a 12‚Äì0 victory vs St. Albans in a driving rain storm. The team went 3‚Äì2 in a non-Inter-High exhibition season in 1936. The stars of the squad were RB Dave Tate (who scored Wilson's first-ever touchdown), RB Nick Cokinos, and E Johnny Stevens. Wilson football officially joined the Inter-High Series for the 1937 season. For his play on the gridiron in the fall of 1937, E Johnny Stevens was named as Wilson's first All High player for football. (Two baseball players had been named that spring for Wilson's first-ever entries into the All High selections.) The new Wilson Stadium opened during the football season of 1939. The \\"Presidents,\\" as they were frequently called by the newspaper sports writers in the early years, played their first home football game in Wilson Stadium on October 6, 1939, against Landon. The official flag-raising dedication took place on October 27 in front of a capacity crowd of 2,000 prior to the kickoff of the 1939 Inter-High home opener vs Western. In the 1949 season, the Tigers football squad, under Coach Joe Carlo, outscored opponents by 206 to 77. They went on to win their first Inter-High Championship by beating McKinley Tech by a score of 21 to 20, made possible by three extra points from placekicker Dick Sebastian. The next weekend, the Tigers played in the Second Annual City Championship game against Catholic League champions Gonzaga in front of 7,949 fans in Griffith Stadium; the Tigers lost the game with a final score of 12‚Äì7. Stars of that team were B Lee Brinson, E Pete Haley, C Preston Kavanaugh, T Don Meaney, and B Leo Speros. Three seasons later, in 1952, Wilson went unbeaten under the direction of Coach Joe Carlo. The team won its second Inter-High Football Championship in front of 7,000 fans. Although the Western Red Raiders were considered the underdog, they scored a 13‚Äì0 lead before the Wilson offense took control and won the game, 41‚Äì16. RB Mike Sommer, who had won the Inter-High Track Sprint Champion and been named as All Met Running Back, ran for more than and scored five touchdowns. The Wilson team continued on to win its only City Championship in football: on December 5, 1952, Wilson beat Catholic League champion St. John's with a score of 24‚Äì6 before a crowd of 12,000 in Griffith Stadium. The Tigers' defense dominated the second half of the championship game, denying St. John's any first downs or even access past midfield. Stars of the Wilson performance in that game, and also All Met players, were T Max Carpenter, B Lon Herzbrun, B Mike Sommer, and G Chico Stone. Wilson players participated in the first integrated high school football game ever played in the District, after the historic Brown v. Board of Education decision came down in May, 1954. On December 4, 1954, five Wilson players ‚Äì Don McMurray, John Webster, Bob Rogers, Mike Hixson, and Leland Phillips ‚Äì played on a mixed black and white team before a crowd of 8,800 at Griffith Stadium. The integrated Inter-High All Stars beat St. John's, 12‚Äì7, to end the St. John's thirteen-game winning streak and capture the 1954 City Football Championship. Other sports The Woodrow Wilson cross-country team, coached by Alfred Collins, won their first Inter-High championship on November 6, 1963. The championship race was held at the Langston Golf Course. Seniors Charlie Hudson and Charlie Smith finished second and sixth respectively, while sophomore Doug Coffin finished eight. Over the course of the season, both Hudson and Smith set a number of records. Regardless, Eastern and Spingarn High School were the favorites in the championship. The depth of Wilson's team soundly defeated both. The Washington Post named Hudson and Smith to the first team all-met cross-country team, both of whom went on to be founding members of the Sports International Track Club with members from BCC, Gonzaga, St. Albans, Episcopal and the American University. The club attracted a number of world-class athletes who went on to represent the United States, Trinidad & Tobago, and Barbados at the Olympic Games. The Wilson boys' ultimate frisbee team is currently ranked 8th in the country and the girls' team 17th, according to Ultiworld magazine as of April 5, 2019. The Tigers athletic program maintains the only crew team among D.C. public high schools. In 2007, Wilson became the first public high school in Washington, D.C. to play varsity ice hockey with a team in the Maryland Scholastic Hockey League's Capitol Conference. The team plays its home games at Fort Dupont Ice Arena, the only public ice rink in the District of Columbia. The Wilson varsity softball won the DCIAA championship for the three consecutive years in 2007, 2008, and 2009. In 2009 the team, led by seniors Kathleen McLain and Rachel Bitting, played Georgetown Visitation in the Congressional Bank Softball Classic in which the softball champion of the DC public schools played the champion of the DC private schools. Wilson won the game, 3‚Äì2; McLain struck out eight batters without allowing any walks, and Bitting hit a walk-off double in the bottom of the last inning. The Wilson swim team returned for the 2006‚Äì2007 season and claimed the city championship in the same year. Wilson's wrestling program has been intermittent. In 2005, Wilson ended its wrestling program, becoming the last public school in Washington DC to have a wrestling team. However, in 2012, the program was restarted. The Wilson Cheerleading team won the 2014 DCIAA championship title. Athletic facilities Wilson Stadium opened for duty in 1939. An artificial turf field was installed over the summer of 2007. A sound system, press box, and lights were also added to the stadium. The stadium is now used for several sports, including soccer, football and lacrosse. There has been an aquatic facility on the Wilson High School campus since the late 1970s. It first opened in 1978, but was condemned and demolished in 2007. A new Aquatic Center for Ward 3 was completed in 2009, with an indoor 50-meter swimming pool, a children's pool, and other facilities. =Publications= Wilson's school newspaper is called The Beacon.

This enables analysis and incorporation of the results into a Geographic Information System (GIS) for further analysis, correlation with other variables, mapping, and display. Currently, the only three manufacturers of scientific-quality digital echsounders commonly used for resource assessment are BioSonics, HTI (Hydroacoustic Technology, Inc.) and Simrad. Other specialty manufacturers of scientific quality echosounders exist. Features of modern digital scientific echosounder technology include: * Low side-lobe transducers * Simple data collection * Low system noise * Wide dynamic range * High system stability * High accuracy * Easy system expansion * Multiplexing systems (multiple transducers can operate simultaneously on the same system)  Scientific software for analysis of hydroacoustic data  Specially written software is available for analysis of hydroacoustic data for assessment of underwater physical and biological characteristics. \\"Fish\\" here can apply to any \\"target\\" in the water column, e.g., fish, plankton, squid, mammal. All results can be imported into a GIS for additional analysis, correlation with other variables, mapping, and display. ;Bathymetry : the depth (range) of the bottom of the river, lake, or ocean below the transducer. ; Range : the distance between the transducer and the \\"target\\" (fish, zooplankton, vegetation, bottom). This is determined by precise timing from sound generation to sound reception (by the transducer). ;Bottom type; Seabed type; Substrate type; or Sediment type : can be assessed and classified (e.g., sand, rock, soft mud, hard mud). ;Fish quantity : can be estimated and reported as numbers of fish or biomass. ;Fish size : can be determined in a relative manner, based on acoustic \\"target size\\". ;Fish behavior : can be assessed through a combination of instantaneous and temporal measures and observations. Spatial distribution, size distributions, diurnal activity, predator-prey relationships, migration rates, temporal activity, etc. can be observed and quantified. ;Submersed aquatic vegetation; Submerged aquatic vegetation; or SAV : can be detected and assessed for location, density, and height. ;Fish passage : can be quantified for fish movement past a fixed-location hydroacoustic monitoring system. Examples include: Migrating salmon or fish entrained by water intakes. Data collected with a scientific echosounder can be analyzed for the presence, abundance, distribution and acoustic characteristics of such variables as: depth (bathymetry), bottom substrate class (e.g., sand, mud, rock), submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV), and water column scattering (fish and plankton). Resulting analysis can be used to generate GIS data layers for these variables.  Applications  Scientific echosounders are commonly used by International, Federal, State and Local government and management agencies, as well as private-sector consultants working for these public agencies. Academic institutions have realized and are teaching the value of sampling non- invasively with sound to enhance both the spatial coverage and objectivity of fisheries sampling. Fisheries management agencies such as the membership of ICES and the United States National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) commonly use scientific sonar for stock assessment purposes, such as herring biomass assessment for resource management purposes. More recently, the acoustic data collected has been valuable in underwater habitat assessment and classification for the variables; seabed type (e.g. rock, mud, sand) and submersed aquatic vegetation and algae - with the appropriate software.

State parties (signatories) to the Geneva Convention of 1949 and its Additional Protocols of 1977 (Protocol I, Protocol II) and 2005 have given the ICRC a mandate to protect victims of international and internal armed conflicts. Such victims include war wounded, prisoners, refugees, civilians, and other non-combatants. p.6. The ICRC is part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, along with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and 192 National Societies. It is the oldest and most honoured organization within the movement and one of the most widely recognized organizations in the world, having won three Nobel Peace Prizes (in 1917, 1944, and 1963). History =Solferino, Henry Dunant and the foundation of the ICRC= Henry Dunant, author of A Memory of Solferino Up until the middle of the 19th century, there were no organized and well- established army nursing systems for casualties and no safe and protected institutions to accommodate and treat those who were wounded on the battlefield. In June 1859, the Swiss businessman Henry Dunant travelled to Italy to meet French emperor Napol√©on III with the intention of discussing difficulties in conducting business in Algeria, at that time occupied by France. When he arrived in the small Italian town of Solferino on the evening of 24 June, he witnessed the aftermath of the Battle of Solferino, an engagement in the Second Italian War of Independence. In a single day, about 40,000 soldiers on both sides died or were left wounded on the field. Henry Dunant was shocked by the terrible aftermath of the battle, the suffering of the wounded soldiers, and the near-total lack of medical attendance and basic care. He completely abandoned the original intent of his trip and for several days he devoted himself to helping with the treatment and care for the wounded. He succeeded in organizing an overwhelming level of relief assistance by motivating the local population to aid without discrimination. Back in his home in Geneva, he decided to write a book entitled A Memory of SolferinoIRC, Memory of Solferino by Henry Dunant, ICRC publication 1986, complete text which he published with his own money in 1862. He sent copies of the book to leading political and military figures throughout Europe. In addition to penning a vivid description of his experiences in Solferino in 1859, he explicitly advocated the formation of national voluntary relief organizations to help nurse wounded soldiers in the case of war. In addition, he called for the development of international treaties to guarantee the neutrality and protection of those wounded on the battlefield as well as medics and field hospitals. Original document of the first Geneva Convention, 1864 On 9 February 1863 in Geneva, Henry Dunant founded the \\"Committee of the Five\\" (together with four other leading figures from well-known Geneva families) as an investigatory commission of the Geneva Society for Public Welfare.IRC Geneva Society for Public Welfare, 1863 Their aim was to examine the feasibility of Dunant's ideas and to organize an international conference about their possible implementation. The members of this committee, aside from Dunant himself, were Gustave Moynier, lawyer and chairman of the Geneva Society for Public Welfare; physician Louis Appia, who had significant experience working as a field surgeon; Appia's friend and colleague Th√©odore Maunoir, from the Geneva Hygiene and Health Commission; and Guillaume-Henri Dufour, a Swiss Army general of great renown. Eight days later, the five men decided to rename the committee to the \\"International Committee for Relief to the Wounded\\". In October (26‚Äì29) 1863, the international conference organized by the committee was held in Geneva to develop possible measures to improve medical services on the battle field. The conference was attended by 36 individuals: eighteen official delegates from national governments, six delegates from other non-governmental organizations, seven non-official foreign delegates, and the five members of the International Committee. The states and kingdoms represented by official delegates were Grand Duchy of Baden, Kingdom of Bavaria, Second French Empire, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Kingdom of Hanover, Grand Duchy of Hesse, Kingdom of Italy, Kingdom of the Netherlands, Austrian Empire, Kingdom of Prussia, Russian Empire, Kingdom of Saxony, United Kingdoms of Sweden and Norway, and Spanish Empire.Angela Bennett: The Geneva Convention. The Hidden Origins of the Red Cross. Sutton Publishing, Gloucestershire 2005, Among the proposals written in the final resolutions of the conference, adopted on 29 October 1863, were: * The foundation of national relief societies for wounded soldiers; * Neutrality and protection for wounded soldiers; * The utilization of volunteer forces for relief assistance on the battlefield; * The organization of additional conferences to enact these concepts in legally binding international treaties; and * The introduction of a common distinctive protection symbol for medical personnel in the field, namely a white armlet bearing a red cross, honoring the history of neutrality of Switzerland and of its own Swiss organizers by reversing the Swiss flag's colors. The Red Cross in action in 1864 Only one year later, the Swiss government invited the governments of all European countries, as well as the United States, Brazil, and Mexico, to attend an official diplomatic conference. Sixteen countries sent a total of twenty-six delegates to Geneva. On 22 August 1864, the conference adopted the first Geneva Convention \\"for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded in Armies in the Field\\". Representatives of 12 states and kingdoms signed the convention:    The convention contained ten articles, establishing for the first time legally binding rules guaranteeing neutrality and protection for wounded soldiers, field medical personnel, and specific humanitarian institutions in an armed conflict. Furthermore, the convention defined two specific requirements for recognition of a national relief society by the International Committee: * The national society must be recognized by its own national government as a relief society according to the convention, and * The national government of the respective country must be a state party to the Geneva Convention. Directly following the establishment of the Geneva Convention, the first national societies were founded in Belgium, Denmark, France, Oldenburg, Prussia, Spain, and W√ºrttemberg. Also in 1864, Louis Appia and Charles van de Velde, a captain of the Dutch Army, became the first independent and neutral delegates to work under the symbol of the Red Cross in an armed conflict. Three years later in 1867, the first International Conference of National Aid Societies for the Nursing of the War Wounded was convened. Memorial commemorating the first use of the Red Cross symbol in an armed conflict during the Battle of Dybb√∏l (Denmark) in 1864; jointly erected in 1989 by the national Red Cross societies of Denmark and Germany Also in 1867, Henry Dunant was forced to declare bankruptcy due to business failures in Algeria, partly because he had neglected his business interests during his tireless activities for the International Committee. The controversy surrounding Dunant's business dealings and the resulting negative public opinion, combined with an ongoing conflict with Gustave Moynier, led to Dunant's expulsion from his position as a member and secretary. He was charged with fraudulent bankruptcy and a warrant for his arrest was issued. Thus, he was forced to leave Geneva and never returned to his home city. In the following years, national societies were founded in nearly every country in Europe. The project resonated well with patriotic sentiments that were on the rise in the late-nineteenth- century, and national societies were often encouraged as signifiers of national moral superiority. In 1876, the committee adopted the name \\"International Committee of the Red Cross\\" (ICRC), which is still its official designation today. Five years later, the American Red Cross was founded through the efforts of Clara Barton. More and more countries signed the Geneva Convention and began to respect it in practice during armed conflicts. In a rather short period of time, the Red Cross gained huge momentum as an internationally respected movement, and the national societies became increasingly popular as a venue for volunteer work. When the first Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in 1901, the Norwegian Nobel Committee opted to give it jointly to Henry Dunant and Fr√©d√©ric Passy, a leading international pacifist. More significant than the honour of the prize itself, the official congratulation from the International Committee of the Red Cross marked the overdue rehabilitation of Henry Dunant and represented a tribute to his key role in the formation of the Red Cross. Dunant died nine years later in the small Swiss health resort of Heiden. Only two months earlier his long-standing adversary Gustave Moynier had also died, leaving a mark in the history of the committee as its longest-serving President ever. In 1906, the 1864 Geneva Convention was revised for the first time. One year later, the Hague Convention X, adopted at the Second International Peace Conference in The Hague, extended the scope of the Geneva Convention to naval warfare. Shortly before the beginning of the First World War in 1914, 50 years after the foundation of the ICRC and the adoption of the first Geneva Convention, there were already 45 national relief societies throughout the world. The movement had extended itself beyond Europe and North America to Central and South America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Mexico, Peru, El Salvador, Uruguay, Venezuela), Asia (the Republic of China, Japan, Korea, Siam), and Africa (South Africa). =World War I= French postcard celebrating the role of Red Cross nurses during the First World War, 1915. With the outbreak of World War I, the ICRC found itself confronted with enormous challenges which it could only handle by working closely with the national Red Cross societies. Red Cross nurses from around the world, including the United States and Japan, came to support the medical services of the armed forces of the European countries involved in the war. On 15 October 1914, immediately after the start of the war, the ICRC set up its International Prisoners-of-War (POW) Agency, which had about 1,200 mostly volunteer staff members by the end of 1914. By the end of the war, the Agency had transferred about 20 million letters and messages, 1.9 million parcels, and about 18 million Swiss francs in monetary donations to POWs of all affected countries. Furthermore, due to the intervention of the Agency, about 200,000 prisoners were exchanged between the warring parties, released from captivity and returned to their home country. The organizational card index of the Agency accumulated about 7 million records from 1914 to 1923, each card representing an individual prisoner or missing person. The card index led to the identification of about 2 million POWs and the ability to contact their families, as part of the Restoring Family Links effort of the organization. The complete index is on loan today from the ICRC to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Museum in Geneva. The right to access the index is still strictly restricted to the ICRC. During the entire war, the ICRC monitored warring parties' compliance with the Geneva Conventions of the 1907 revision and forwarded complaints about violations to the respective country. When chemical weapons were used in this war for the first time in history, the ICRC vigorously protested against this new type of warfare. Even without having a mandate from the Geneva Conventions, the ICRC tried to ameliorate the suffering of civil populations. In territories that were officially designated as \\"occupied territories,\\" the ICRC could assist the civilian population on the basis of the Hague Convention's \\"Laws and Customs of War on Land\\" of 1907. This convention was also the legal basis for the ICRC's work for prisoners of war. In addition to the work of the International Prisoner-of-War Agency as described above this included inspection visits to POW camps. A total of 524 camps throughout Europe were visited by 41 delegates from the ICRC until the end of the war. Between 1916 and 1918, the ICRC published a number of postcards with scenes from the POW camps. The pictures showed the prisoners in day-to-day activities such as the distribution of letters from home. The intention of the ICRC was to provide the families of the prisoners with some hope and solace and to alleviate their uncertainties about the fate of their loved ones. After the end of the war, the ICRC organized the return of about 420,000 prisoners to their home countries. In 1920, the task of repatriation was handed over to the newly founded League of Nations, which appointed the Norwegian diplomat and scientist Fridtjof Nansen as its \\"High Commissioner for Repatriation of the War Prisoners\\". His legal mandate was later extended to support and care for war refugees and displaced persons when his office became that of the League of Nations \\"High Commissioner for Refugees\\". Nansen, who invented the Nansen passport for stateless refugees and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1922, appointed two delegates from the ICRC as his deputies. A year before the end of the war, the ICRC received the 1917 Nobel Peace Prize for its outstanding wartime work. It was the only Nobel Peace Prize awarded in the period from 1914 to 1918. In 1923, the Committee adopted a change in its policy regarding the selection of new members. Until then, only citizens from the city of Geneva could serve in the committee. This limitation was expanded to include Swiss citizens. As a direct consequence of World War I, an additional protocol to the Geneva Convention was adopted in 1925 which outlawed the use of suffocating or poisonous gases and biological agents as weapons. Four years later, the original Convention was revised and the second Geneva Convention \\"relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War\\" was established. The events of World War I and the respective activities of the ICRC significantly increased the reputation and authority of the Committee among the international community and led to an extension of its competencies. As early as in 1934, a draft proposal for an additional convention for the protection of the civil population during an armed conflict was adopted by the International Red Cross Conference. Unfortunately, most governments had little interest in implementing this convention, and it was thus prevented from entering into force before the beginning of World War II. =Chaco War= In the Interwar period, Bolivia and Paraguay were disputing possession of the Gran Chaco - a desert region between the two countries. The dispute escalated into a full- scale conflict in 1932. During the war the ICRC visited 18,000 Bolivian prisoners of war and 2,500 Paraguayan detainees. With the help of the ICRC both countries made improvements to the conditions of the detainees. =World War II= Red Cross message from ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Poland, 1940. The most reliable primary source on the role of the Red Cross during World War II are the three volumes of the \\"Report of the International Committee of the Red Cross on its activities during the second world war (September 1, 1939 ‚Äì June 30, 1947)\\" written by the International Committee of the Red Cross itself. The report can be read online. The legal basis of the work of the ICRC during World War II was the Geneva Conventions in their 1929 revision. The activities of the committee were similar to those during World War I: visiting and monitoring POW camps, organizing relief assistance for civilian populations, and administering the exchange of messages regarding prisoners and missing persons. By the end of the war, 179 delegates had conducted 12,750 visits to POW camps in 41 countries. The Central Information Agency on Prisoners-of-War (Zentralauskunftsstelle f√ºr Kriegsgefangene) had a staff of 3,000, the card index tracking prisoners contained 45 million cards, and 120 million messages were exchanged by the Agency. Moreover, two other main parties to the conflict, the Soviet Union and Japan, were not party to the 1929 Geneva Conventions and were not legally required to follow the rules of the conventions. During the war, the ICRC failed to obtain an agreement with Nazi Germany about the treatment of detainees in concentration camps, and it eventually abandoned applying pressure to avoid disrupting its work with POWs. The ICRC also failed to develop a response to reliable information about the extermination camps and the mass killing of European Jews. This is still considered the greatest failure of the ICRC in its history. After November 1943, the ICRC achieved permission to send parcels to concentration camp detainees with known names and locations. Because the notices of receipt for these parcels were often signed by other inmates, the ICRC managed to register the identities of about 105,000 detainees in the concentration camps and delivered about 1.1 million parcels, primarily to the camps Dachau, Buchenwald, Ravensbr√ºck, and Sachsenhausen.p. 75. Marcel Junod, delegate of the ICRC, visiting POWs in Nazi Germany. Swiss historian Jean-Claude Favez, who conducted an 8-year review of the Red Cross records, says that even though the Red Cross knew by November 1942 about the Nazi's annihilation plans for the Jews ‚Äì and even discussed it with U.S. officials ‚Äì the group did nothing to inform the public, maintaining silence even in the face of pleas by Jewish groups.p. 6. Because the Red Cross was based in Geneva and largely funded by the Swiss government, it was very sensitive to Swiss wartime attitudes and policies. In October 1942, the Swiss government and the Red Cross' board of members vetoed a proposal by several Red Cross board members to condemn the persecution of civilians by the Nazis. For the rest of the war, the Red Cross took its cues from Switzerland in avoiding acts of opposition or confrontation with the Nazis.p. 88. A sick Polish survivor in the Hannover-Ahlem concentration camp receives medicine from a German Red Cross worker, April 1945 On 12 March 1945, ICRC President Jacob Burckhardt received a message from SS General Ernst Kaltenbrunner accepting the ICRC's demand to allow delegates to visit the concentration camps. This agreement was bound by the condition that these delegates would have to stay in the camps until the end of the war. Ten delegates, among them Louis Haefliger (Mauthausen Camp), Paul Dunant (Theresienstadt Camp) and Victor Maurer (Dachau Camp), accepted the assignment and visited the camps. Louis Haefliger prevented the forceful eviction or blasting of Mauthausen- Gusen by alerting American troops, thereby saving the lives of about 60,000 inmates. His actions were condemned by the ICRC because they were deemed as acting unduly on his own authority and risking the ICRC's neutrality. Only in 1990 was his reputation finally rehabilitated by ICRC President Cornelio Sommaruga. In 1944, the ICRC received its second Nobel Peace Prize. As in World War I, it received the only Peace Prize awarded during the main period of war, 1939 to 1945. At the end of the war, the ICRC worked with national Red Cross societies to organize relief assistance to those countries most severely affected. In 1948, the Committee published a report reviewing its war-era activities from 1 September 1939 to 30 June 1947. Since January 1996, the ICRC archive for this period has been open to academic and public research. =After World War II= On 12 August 1949, further revisions to the existing two Geneva Conventions were adopted. An additional convention \\"for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea\\", now called the second Geneva Convention, was brought under the Geneva Convention umbrella as a successor to the 1907 Hague Convention X. The 1929 Geneva convention \\"relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War\\" may have been the second Geneva Convention from a historical point of view (because it was actually formulated in Geneva), but after 1949 it came to be called the third Convention because it came later chronologically than the Hague Convention. Reacting to the experience of World War II, the Fourth Geneva Convention, a new Convention \\"relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War,\\" was established. Also, the additional protocols of 8 June 1977 were intended to make the conventions apply to internal conflicts such as civil wars. Today, the four conventions and their added protocols contain more than 600 articles, a remarkable expansion when compared to the mere 10 articles in the first 1864 convention. The ICRC Headquarters in Geneva. In celebration of its centennial in 1963, the ICRC, together with the League of Red Cross Societies, received its third Nobel Peace Prize. Since 1993, non-Swiss individuals have been allowed to serve as Committee delegates abroad, a task which was previously restricted to Swiss citizens. Indeed, since then, the share of staff without Swiss citizenship has increased to about 35%. On 16 October 1990, the UN General Assembly decided to grant the ICRC observer status for its assembly sessions and sub-committee meetings, the first observer status given to a private organization. The resolution was jointly proposed by 138 member states and introduced by the Italian ambassador, Vieri Traxler, in memory of the organization's origins in the Battle of Solferino. An agreement with the Swiss government signed on 19 March 1993, affirmed the already long-standing policy of full independence of the committee from any possible interference by Switzerland. The agreement protects the full sanctity of all ICRC property in Switzerland including its headquarters and archive, grants members and staff legal immunity, exempts the ICRC from all taxes and fees, guarantees the protected and duty-free transfer of goods, services, and money, provides the ICRC with secure communication privileges at the same level as foreign embassies, and simplifies Committee travel in and out of Switzerland. The ICRC continued its activities throughout the 1990s. It broke its customary media silence when it denounced the Rwandan genocide in 1994. It struggled to prevent the crimes that happened in and around Srebrenica in 1995 but admitted, \\"We must acknowledge that despite our efforts to help thousands of civilians forcibly expelled from the town and despite the dedication of our colleagues on the spot, the ICRC's impact on the unfolding of the tragedy was extremely limited.\\"M√©gevand-Roggo, B√©atrice. Srebrenica ‚Äì remembering the missing. 5 July 2005. It went public once again in 2007 to decry \\"major human rights abuses\\" by Burma's military government including forced labour, starvation, and murder of men, women, and children.\\"Red Cross Condemns Burman 'Abuses'\\" BBC News. 29 Jun 2007. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia- pacific/6252024.stm Fatalities At the end of the Cold War, the ICRC's work actually became more dangerous. In the 1990s, more delegates lost their lives than at any point in its history, especially when working in local and internal armed conflicts. These incidents often demonstrated a lack of respect for the rules of the Geneva Conventions and their protection symbols. Among the slain delegates were: * Fr√©d√©ric Maurice. He died on 19 May 1992 at the age of 39, one day after a Red Cross transport he was escorting was attacked in the former Yugoslavian city of Sarajevo. * Fernanda Calado (Spain), Ingeborg Foss (Norway), Nancy Malloy (Canada), Gunnhild Myklebust (Norway), Sheryl Thayer (New Zealand), and Hans Elkerbout (Netherlands). They were shot at point-blank range while sleeping in the early hours of 17 December 1996 in the ICRC field hospital in the Chechen city of Nowije Atagi near Grozny. Their murderers have never been caught and there was no apparent motive for the killings. * Rita Fox (Switzerland), V√©ronique Saro (Democratic Republic of Congo, formerly Zaire), Julio Delgado (Colombia), Unen Ufoirworth (DR Congo), Aduwe Boboli (DR Congo), and Jean Molokabonge (DR Congo). On 26 April 2001, they were en route with two cars on a relief mission in the northeast of the Democratic Republic of Congo when they came under fatal fire from unknown attackers. * Ricardo Munguia (El Salvador). He was working as a water engineer in Afghanistan and travelling from Kandahar to Tirin Kot with local colleagues on 27 March 2003 when their car was stopped by unknown armed men. He was killed execution-style at point-blank range while his colleagues were allowed to escape. He was 39 years old. The killing prompted the ICRC to temporarily suspend operations across Afghanistan. Thereby the assumption that ICRC's reputation for neutrality and effective work in Afghanistan over the past thirty years would protect its delegates was shattered.Terry, F. (2011). The international committee of the red cross in afghanistan: Reasserting the neutrality of humanitarian action. International Review of the Red Cross, 93(881), 175. doi:https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1816383111000026 * Vatche Arslanian (Canada). Since 2001, he worked as a logistics coordinator for the ICRC mission in Iraq. He died when he was travelling through Baghdad together with members of the Iraqi Red Crescent. Their car accidentally came into the crossfire of fighting in the city. * Nadisha Yasassri Ranmuthu (Sri Lanka). He was killed by unknown attackers on 22 July 2003, when his car was fired upon near the city of Hilla in the south of Baghdad. *Emmerich Pregetter (Austria). He was an ICRC Logistics Specialist who was killed by a swarm of bees on 11 August 2008. Emmerich was participating in a field trip along with the ICRC Water and Habitat team on a convoy which was delivering construction material for reconstruction of a rural surgical health clinic in the area of Jebel Marra, West Darfur, Sudan. =The Holocaust= By taking part in the 1995 ceremony to commemorate the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp, the President of the ICRC, Cornelio Sommaruga, sought to show that the organization was fully aware of the gravity of The Holocaust and the need to keep the memory of it alive, so as to prevent any repetition of it. He paid tribute to all those who had suffered or lost their lives during the war and publicly regretted the past mistakes and shortcomings of the Red Cross with regard to the victims of the concentration camps.. In 2002, an ICRC official outlined some of the lessons the organization has learned from the failure: *from a legal point of view, the work that led to the adoption of the Geneva Convention relative to the protection of civilian persons in time of war; *from an ethical point of view, the adoption of the declaration of the Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, building on the distinguished work of Max Huber and Jean Pictet, to prevent any more abuses such as those that occurred within the movement after Hitler rose to power in 1933; *on a political level, the ICRC's relationship with Switzerland was redesigned to ensure its independence; *with a view to keeping memories alive, the ICRC accepted, in 1955, to take over the direction of the International Tracing Service where records from concentration camps are maintained; *finally, to establish the historical facts of the case, the ICRC invited Jean-Claude Favez to carry out an independent investigation of its activities on behalf of the victims of Nazi persecution, and gave him unfettered access to the ICRC archives relating to this period; out of concern for transparency, the ICRC also decided to give all other historians access to its archives dating back more than 50 years; having gone over the conclusions of Favez's work, the ICRC acknowledged its past failings and expressed its regrets in this regard.. In an official statement made on 27 January 2005, the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, the ICRC stated: > Auschwitz also represents the greatest failure in the history of the ICRC, > aggravated by its lack of decisiveness in taking steps to aid the victims of > Nazi persecution. This failure will remain part of the ICRC's memory, as > will the courageous acts of individual ICRC delegates at the time. Characteristics The emblem of the International Committee of the Red Cross (French: Comit√© international de la Croix-Rouge) The original motto of the International Committee of the Red Cross was Inter Arma Caritas (\\"Amidst War, Charity\\"). It has preserved this motto while other Red Cross organizations have adopted others. Due to Geneva's location in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, the ICRC is also known under its initial French name Comit√© international de la Croix-Rouge (CICR). However, the ICRC has three official languages (English, French and Spanish). The official symbol of the ICRC is the Red Cross on white background (the inverse of the Swiss flag) with the words \\"COMITE INTERNATIONAL GENEVE\\" circling the cross. Under the Geneva Convention, the red cross, red crescent and red crystal emblems provide protection for military medical services and relief workers in armed conflicts and is to be placed on humanitarian and medical vehicles and buildings. The original emblem that has a red cross on a white background is the exact reverse of the flag of neutral Switzerland. It was later supplemented by two others which are the Red Crescent, and the Red Crystal. The Red Crescent was adopted by the Ottoman Empire during the Russo-Turkish war and the Red Crystal by the governments in 2005, as an additional emblem devoid of any national, political or religious connotation. =Mission= The official mission statement says that: \\"The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is an impartial, neutral, and independent organization whose independently humanitarian mission is to protect the lives and dignity of victims of war and internal violence and to provide them with assistance.\\" It also conducts and coordinates international relief and works to promote and strengthen international humanitarian law and universal humanitarian principles.ICRC. The Mission.. 7 May 2006. The core tasks of the committee, which are derived from the Geneva Conventions and its own statutes are: * to monitor compliance of warring parties with the Geneva Conventions * to organize nursing and care for those who are wounded on the battlefield * to supervise the treatment of prisoners of war and make confidential interventions with detaining authorities * to help with the search for missing persons in an armed conflict (tracing service) * to organize protection and care for civil populations * to act as a neutral intermediary between warring parties The ICRC drew up seven fundamental principles in 1965 that were adopted by the entire Red Cross Movement.David P Forsythe, The Humanitarians: The International Committee of the Red Cross, (Cambridge, NY:Cambridge University Press, 2005), 161. They are humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence, volunteerism, unity, and universality.ICRC. 1 Jan 1995. The Fundamental Principles. =Legal status= The ICRC is the only institution explicitly named in international humanitarian law as a controlling authority. The legal mandate of the ICRC stems from the four Geneva Conventions of 1949, as well as its own Statutes. The ICRC also undertakes tasks that are not specifically mandated by law, such as visiting political prisoners outside of conflict and providing relief in natural disasters. The ICRC is a private Swiss association that has enjoyed various degrees of special privileges and legal immunities within the territory of Switzerland for many years. On 19 March 1993, a legal foundation for this special treatment was created by a formal agreement between the Swiss government and the ICRC. This agreement protects the full sanctity of all ICRC property in Switzerland including its headquarters and archive, grants members and staff legal immunity, exempts the ICRC from all taxes and fees, guarantees protected and duty-free transfer of goods, services, and money, provides the ICRC with secure communication privileges at the same level as foreign embassies, and simplifies Committee travel in and out of Switzerland. On the other hand, Switzerland does not recognize ICRC-issued passports.Council of the European Union ‚Äì Schengen Visa Working Party ‚Äì Table of travel documents Contrary to popular belief, the ICRC is not a sovereign entity like the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. The ICRC limits its membership to Swiss nationals only, and also it does not have a policy of open and unrestricted membership for individuals as its new members are selected by the Committee itself (a process called cooptation). However, since the early 1990s, the ICRC employs persons from all over the world to serve in its field mission and at Headquarters. In 2007, almost half of ICRC staff was non-Swiss. The ICRC has special privileges and legal immunities in many countries, based on national law in these countries, based on agreements between the ICRC and the respective governments, or, in some cases, based on international jurisprudence (such as the right of ICRC delegates not to bear witness in front of international tribunals). =Legal Basis= The ICRC's operations are generally based on international humanitarian law, primarily comprising the four Geneva Conventions of 1949, their two Additional Protocols of 1977 and Additional Protocol III of 2005, the Statutes of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, and the resolutions of the International Conferences of the Red Cross and Red Crescent.http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/annual-report/annual- report-legal-bases-2009.htm International humanitarian law is founded upon the Geneva conventions, the first of which was signed in 1864 by 16 countries. The First Geneva Convention of 1949 covers the protection for the wounded and sick of armed conflict on land. The Second Geneva Convention asks for the protection and care for the wounded, sick and shipwrecked of armed conflict at sea. The Third Geneva Convention concerns the treatment of prisoners of war. The Fourth Geneva Convention concerns the protection of civilians in time of war. In addition, there are many more customary international laws that come into effect when necessary. =Funding and financial matters= The 2010 budget of the ICRC amounts to about 1156 million Swiss francs.ICRC. 1 Dec 2009 Key Data for ICRC Emergency and Headquarters Appeals 2010. All payments to the ICRC are voluntary and are received as donations based on two types of appeals issued by the committee: an annual Headquarters Appeal to cover its internal costs and Emergency Appeals for its individual missions. The total budget for 2009 consists of about 996.9 million Swiss Francs (85% of the total) for field work and 168.6 million Swiss Francs (15%) for internal costs. In 2009, the budget for field work increased by 6.9% and the internal budget by 4.4% compared to 2008, primarily due to above-average increases in the number and scope of its missions in Africa. Most of the ICRC's funding comes from Switzerland and the United States, with other European states and the EU close behind. Together with Australia, Canada, Japan, and New Zealand, they contribute about 80‚Äì85% of the ICRC's budget. About 3% comes from private gifts, and the rest comes from national Red Cross societies.Forsythe, The Humanitarians, 233. =Responsibilities within the movement= The ICRC is responsible for legally recognizing a relief society as an official national Red Cross or Red Crescent society and thus accepting it into the movement. The exact rules for recognition are defined in the statutes of the movement. After recognition by the ICRC, a national society is admitted as a member to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (the Federation, or IFRC). The ICRC and the Federation cooperate with the individual national societies in their international missions, especially with human, material, and financial resources and organizing on-site logistics. According to the 1997 Seville Agreement, the ICRC is the lead Red Cross agency in conflicts while other organizations within the movement take the lead in non-war situations. National societies will be given the lead especially when a conflict is happening within their own country. Organization The ICRC is headquartered in the Swiss city of Geneva and has external offices called Delegations in about eighty countries. Each delegation is under the responsibility of a Head of delegation who is the official representative of the ICRC in the country. Of its 2,000 professional employees, roughly 800 work in its Geneva headquarters and 1,200 expatriates work in the field. About half of the field workers serve as delegates managing ICRC operations, while the other half are specialists such as doctors, agronomists, engineers, or interpreters. In the delegations, the international staff are assisted by some 13,000 national employees, bringing the total staff under the authority of the ICRC to roughly 15,000. Delegations also often work closely with the National Red Cross Societies of the countries where they are based, and thus can call on the volunteers of the National Red Cross to assist in some of the ICRC's operations. The organizational structure of the ICRC is not well understood by outsiders. This is partly because of organizational secrecy, but also because the structure itself has been prone to frequent change. The Assembly and Presidency are two long-standing institutions, but the Assembly Council and Directorate were created only in the latter part of the twentieth century. Decisions are often made in a collective way, so authority and power relationships are not set in stone. Today, the leading organs are the Directorate and the Assembly. =Directorate= The Directorate is the executive body of the ICRC. It attends to the daily management of the ICRC, whereas the Assembly sets policy. The Directorate consists of a Director- General and five directors in the areas of \\"Operations\\", \\"Human Resources\\", \\"Financial Resources and Logistics \\", \\"Communication and Information Management\\", and \\"International Law and Cooperation within the Movement\\". The members of the Directorate are appointed by the Assembly to serve for four years. The Director-General has assumed more personal responsibility in recent years, much like a CEO, where he was formerly more of a first among equals at the Directorate.Forsythe, The Humanitarians, 225. =Assembly= The Assembly (also called the Committee) convenes on a regular basis and is responsible for defining aims, guidelines, and strategies and for supervising the financial matters of the committee. The Assembly has a membership of a maximum of twenty-five Swiss citizens. Members must speak the house language of French, but many also speak English and German as well. These Assembly members are co- opted for a period of four years, and there is no limit to the number of terms an individual member can serve. A three-quarters majority vote from all members is required for re-election after the third term, which acts as a motivation for members to remain active and productive. In the early years, every Committee member was Genevan, Protestant, white, and male. The first woman, Ren√©e-Marguerite Cramer, was co-opted in 1918. Since then, several women have attained the Vice Presidency, and the female proportion after the Cold War has been about 15%. The first non-Genevans were admitted in 1923, and one Jew has served in the Assembly.Forsythe, The Humanitarians, 203-6. While the rest of the Red Cross Movement may be multi-national, the Committee believes that its mono-national nature is an asset because the nationality in question is Swiss. Thanks to permanent Swiss neutrality, conflicting parties can be sure that no one from \\"the enemy\\" will be setting policy in Geneva.Forsythe, The Humanitarians, 208. The Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì71 showed that even Red Cross actors (in this case National Societies) can be so bound by nationalism that they are unable to sustain neutral humanitarianism.Bugnion, La Protection, 1138‚Äì41. Assembly Council Furthermore, the Assembly elects a five-member Assembly Council that constitutes an especially active core of the Assembly. The Council meets at least ten times per year and has the authority to decide on behalf of the full Assembly in some matters. The council is also responsible for organizing the Assembly meetings and for facilitating communication between the Assembly and the Directorate. The Assembly Council normally includes the President, two Vice Presidents and two elected members. While one of the Vice Presidents is elected for a four-year term, the other is appointed permanently, his tenure ending by retirement from the vice presidency or from the committee. Currently Olivier Vodoz and Christine BeerliICRC. 27 April 2007. . are the Vice Presidents.ICRC. 1 Jan 2006. The members of the International Committee of the Red Cross. In 2019, Christine Beerli retired and Gilles Carbonnier was appointed vice-president. The President The Assembly also selects, for a term of four years, one individual to act as President of the ICRC. The President is both a member of the Assembly and the leader of the ICRC, and has always been included on the Council since its formation. The President automatically becomes a member of both the Council and the Assembly, but does not necessarily come from within the ICRC. There is a strong faction within the Assembly that wants to reach outside the organization to select a President from Swiss government or professional circles (such as banking or medicine).Forsythe, The Humanitarians, 211. In fact, the four most recent Presidents were all previously officials for the Swiss government. The President's influence and role are not well-defined, and change depending upon the times and each President's personal style. From 2000 to 2012, the President of the ICRC was Jakob Kellenberger, a reclusive man who rarely made diplomatic appearances, but was quite skilled in personal negotiation and comfortable with the dynamics of the Assembly.Forsythe, The Humanitarians, 219. Since July 2012, the President has been Peter Maurer, a Swiss citizen who is a former Secretary for Foreign Affairs. He was appointed by the Assembly for a renewable four-year term.ICRC names new president. 19 October 2011. Retrieved 4 January 2013.

The ICRC had only twelve employees in 1914Philippe Ryfman, La question humanitaire (Paris:Ellipses, 1999), 38. and 1,900 in the Second World War complemented its 1,800 volunteers.Ryfman, La question humanitaire, 129. The number of paid staff dropped off after both wars, but has increased once again in the last few decades, averaging 500 field staff in the 1980s and over a thousand in the 1990s. Beginning in the 1970s, the ICRC became more systematic in training to develop a more professional staff.Georges Willemin and Roger Heacock, The International Committee of the Red Cross, (Dordrecht: Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1984). The ICRC offers attractive careers for university graduates, especially in Switzerland,\\"Le CICR manqu√© de bras,\\" LM, 20 July 2002, 15. but the workload as an ICRC employee is demanding. 15% of the staff leaves each year and 75% of employees stay less than three years.Forsythe, The Humanitarians, 231. The ICRC staff is multi-national and averaged about 50% non-Swiss citizens in 2004. The ICRC's international staff are assisted in their work by some 13,000 national employees hired in the countries where the delegations are based. =The ICRC worldwide 2013= The ICRC operates in over 80 countries with a total number of 11,000 employed people worldwide. The extensive network of missions and delegations of the ICRC can relieve nations that are affected by armed conflicts and other sources of violence. In 2013 the ten largest operations worldwide are Pakistan, Mali/Niger, Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, Colombia, Israel, Somalia, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Sudan.ICRC worldwide. 8 August 2013 In 2011, with support from the Red Cross Society of the DRC, the ICRC returned to their families in the RDC 838 unaccompanied children including over 390 former child soldiers, 34 of whom had been in neighboring countries. Relationships within the movement By virtue of its age and its special position under international humanitarian law, the ICRC is the lead agency in the Red Cross Movement, but it has weathered some power struggles within the movement. The ICRC has come into conflict with the Federation and certain national societies at various times. The American Red Cross threatened to supplant the ICRC with its creation of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies as \\"a real international Red Cross\\" after the First World War.Andre Durand, History of the International Committee of the Red Cross: From Sarajevo to Hiroshima, (Geneva:ICRC, 1984), 147. Elements of the Swedish Red Cross desired to supplant the Swiss authority of the ICRC after WWII.Forsythe, The Humanitarians, 52. Over time the Swedish sentiments subsided, and the IFRC grew to work more harmoniously with the ICRC after years of organizational discord.Forsythe, The Humanitarians, 37. Currently, the IFRC's Movement Cooperation division organizes interaction and cooperation with the ICRC. In 1997, the ICRC and the IFRC signed the Seville Agreement which further defined the responsibilities of both organizations within the movement. According to the agreement, the Federation is the lead agency of the movement in any emergency situation which does not take place as part of an armed conflict. =Acceptance of Magen David Adom= From its inception in 1930 until 2006, the Magen David Adom organization, the Israeli equivalent to the Red Cross, was not accepted as part of the Federation, as it used the Star of David, which the ICRC refused to recognize as an acceptable symbol. This meant that although Arab ambulances would be protected by the ICRC, Israeli ambulances would not. In May 2000, Bernadine Healy, the President of the American Red Cross, wrote: \\"The international committee's feared proliferation of symbols is a pitiful fig leaf, used for decades as the reason for excluding the Magen David Adom ‚Äì the Shield (or Star) of David.\\" In protest over the ICRC's perceived anti-Israel discrimination, the ARC withdrew its financial support. In 2005, at a meeting of nations party to the Geneva convention, the ICRC adopted the new Red Crystal. Magen David Adom then centered the Star of David sign inside the newly accepted signage, and in 2006 was accepted as a full member. Yonatan Yagodovsky, director of MDA's fundraising department, said in an article published in October 2011 that \\"MDA will continue to use its emblem and logo, and no one ever asked us to take it off.\\" International relationships  The Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 1963 when the prize was jointly awarded to the ICRC and the Federation. From left to right: King Olav of Norway, ICRC President Leopold Boissier, League Chairman John MacAulay. The ICRC prefers to engage states directly and relies on low-key and confidential negotiations. to lobby for access to prisoners of war and improvement in their treatment. Its findings are not available to the general public but are shared only with the relevant government. This is in contrast to related organizations like Doctors Without Borders and Amnesty International who are more willing to expose abuses and apply public pressure to governments. The ICRC reasons that this approach allows it greater access and cooperation from governments in the long run. When granted only partial access, the ICRC takes what it can get and keeps discreetly lobbying for greater access. In the era of apartheid South Africa, it was granted access to prisoners like Nelson Mandela serving sentences, but not to those under interrogation and awaiting trial.. After his release, Mandela publicly praised the Red Cross.. The presence of respectable aid organizations can make weak regimes appear more legitimate, according to Fiona Terry, who contends that \\"this is particularly true of [the] ICRC, whose mandate, reputation, and discretion imbue its presence with a particularly affirming quality.\\". Recognizing this power, the ICRC can pressure weak governments to change their behavior by threatening to withdraw. As mentioned above, Nelson Mandela acknowledged that the ICRC compelled better treatment of prisoners. and had leverage over his South African captors because \\"avoiding international condemnation was the authorities' main goal.\\". In a controversial move, three officials from the Palestinian political movement Hamas, which many governments have designated as a terrorist organization, have been living at the International Red Cross office in Jerusalem. Israel believes that these three officials had a role in the 2006 kidnapping of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, and has issued deportation orders for them. Red Cross spokesperson Cecilia Goin, in speaking with CBN News, said that hosting the Hamas officials is in line with the organization's humanitarian mission. Israel arrested two of the Hamas members for conducting \\"Hamas activities inside Jerusalem,\\" said the police. References Bibliography =Books= * Forsythe, David P. and B. Rieffer-Flanagan.

Behind the main building, the elevated train station and highway A12 cross over the Vliet. Drawing of the garden plans of Hofwijck, 1653 Hofwijck (; or Vitaulium in Latin) is a mansion built for 17th- century politician Constantijn Huygens. It is located in Voorburg on the Vliet canal from Den Haag to Leiden. Formal address of the cultural heritage is 2 Westeinde, Voorburg, the Netherlands, but its location today is better known as the Voorburg railway station. Construction After he became a widower, Huygens bought land on the Vliet in Voorburg with plans to build a summer home. At the time it was quite fashionable to have a summer home on a river or canal, and old maps of Voorburg show Hofwijck as one of many. The building itself and the gardens (originally on both sides of the Vliet) were designed by Huygens himself in cooperation with the architect Jacob van Campen. The estate was to be \\"a harmonious piece of paradise on earth, with a garden in God‚Äôs image and likeness.\\" Huygens was very much inspired by the works of classical Roman architect Vitruvius. Pieter Post was in charge of the actual building activities. The building was erected in unplastered brick and is in the Classicist style. It stands in the centre of a square swan pond. Hofwijck was inaugurated in 1642 in the company of friends and relatives.

In the display room for Christiaan, various types of clockworks are shown, as well as some original clocks. Family paintings and furniture are on display throughout the building, and the library of Huygens (now a small office) contains many of his books, and offers the same strategic view out of the window at any boat that may appear (today one only sees highway traffic at eye level, and barge traffic at water level).

Grossly neglected in later years, it was auctioned for demolition in 1849, which was avoided when it was acquired by politician Guillaume Groen van Prinsterer.

This practice derived from the belief that all witches and sorcerers bore a witch's mark that would not feel pain or bleed when pricked.Brian P. Levack, The Witch-Hunt in Early Modern Europe (London: Pearson, 3rd edn., 2006), , p. 52. The mark alone was not enough to convict a person, but did add to the evidence. Pricking was common practice throughout Europe, but was most prevalent in England and Scotland. Professional witch finders earned a good living from unmasking witches, travelling from town to town to perform their services. Hollow wooden handles and retractable points have been saved from these finders, which would give the appearance of an accused witch's flesh being penetrated to the hilt without mark, blood, or pain. Other specially designed needles have been found with a sharp end and a blunt end. Through sleight of hand, the sharp end could be used on \\"normal\\" flesh, drawing blood and causing pain, while the unseen dull end would be used on a supposed witch's mark.

A printer's sample card for the Colombian state of Bolivar produced by the Hamilton Bank Note Company. Nicholas Frederick Seebeck (1857 - June 23, 1899) was a stamp dealer and printer, best known for his stamp-printing contracts with several Latin American countries in the 1890s. Life in USA Seebeck emigrated from Germany to the United States at the age of 9. He soon established himself as a stamp dealer and cataloguer (as a sideline to owning a stationery and printing shop) in New York City, and published the Descriptive Price Catalogue of All Known Postage Stamps of the United States and Foreign Countries in 1876.Linn's Stamp News, Refresher Course, Nicholas Seebeck In 1879, he began printing stamps for the Dominican Republic and the Colombian State of Bolivar. These stamps were printed under a standard sort of printing contract, where he received a fee for printing a specified number of stamps. However, with the Bolivar issues, he began the soon to be infamous practice of year-dating otherwise identical stamp designs. Seebeck was successful enough to be able to sell his business in 1884 and purchase a significant interest in the Hamilton Bank Note Engraving and Printing Co., whose main contract was for printing tickets for the New York City transportation system. Hamilton Bank Note Engraving and Printing Co Ecuador, 1892 Issue, printed by Hamilton Bank Note Co. / Seebeck Seebeck sold his New York stamp business in 1884 and used the money to buy into the Hamilton Bank Note Engraving and Printing Co. In 1889, Seebeck developed a novel plan for Hamilton to print stamps for foreign countries. He offered to supply the stamps for free, provided that: #The stamps would be dated and invalidated at the end of each year, to be replaced by a new series. #Unsold (invalid) stamps would be returned to Seebeck for sale to collectors. #Seebeck retained the right to reprint any invalid stamps as needed for sale to collectors. Seebeck also apparently insisted on printing stamps with values not relevant to the postal rates of the countries using them. There are many long series of stamps where only a few values corresponded to common postal uses. The remaining values were intended for collectors. [This is open to debate for Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador. For Honduras and Nicaragua the following denomination paid these rates: 1c - local post card, 2c domestic post card, 5c domestic letter, 10c double domestic letter or foreign letter, 20c - double rate foreign letter or single foreign letter plus registration, 25c - single foreign letter plus registration plus Acknowledgement of Receipt, 30c - triple foreign letter rate, 40c - 4 times single foreign letter rate, 50c - 5 times foreign letter rate, 75c - 6 times foreign letter rate plus registration plus AR (at least one such cover is known to exist), 1 P - very heavy letters or packages. For El Salvador the following rates were paid: 1c - local card rate, 2c - domestic card rate, 3c - foreign card rate, 5c domestic letter rate, 10c single letter rate to Pacific rim countries, 11c - single foreign letter rate for letters transiting Panama, 12c, single letter rate to Pacific rim countries when the rate changed from 10c to 12c, 13c - single letter rate for via Panama when the rates went from 15c to 13c, 15c - single letter rate to transit Panama when the rates changed. 20c - double foreign letter rate for Pacific rim countries or single rate plus registration, 24c - double letter rate to Pacific rim countries, 25c - single foreign Pacific rim letter rate plus registration and AR, 26c double letter rate for via Panama when rate went from 15c to 13c, 30c - double foreign letter rate for transit by Panama when rates changed or single rate plus registration plus AP, 50c & 1 P - very heavy letter and packets. Except for Nicaragua where commercial letters bearing the 1P, 5P and 10P stamps are known, the 2P, 5P and 10P stamps were not used although a few compliance covers are known.] Seebeck took advantage of a unique connection he had to Central America in that his brother-in-law Ernest Schernikow was the New York consul for El Salvador and Honduras. In 1889, Seebeck left for a tour of Central America with letters of introduction from Schernikow to talk with government officials about an idea for a stamp printing arrangement that would benefit all concerned and signed contracts in 1889-1890 with several countries: Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala (only for fiscal stamps not postage ones), Honduras, and Nicaragua. The contracts were for ten years worth of stamp issues, and also included official, telegraph, revenue stamps and postal stationery.Paper Heritage German philatelic experts who studied the Seebeck issues early in the 20th century claim that Seebeck, instead of reprinting after the stamps were demonetized had excess quantities printed before the stamps were delivered. Since these stamps were printed during the time they were valid for postage they are still considered original postage stamps, whether they were ever delivered to the respective countries' postal authorities or not. This is Philately, by Kenneth A. Wood, Volume Three, Van Dahl Publications 1982 Condemnation of Seebeck among the collecting community was nearly unanimous. Seebeck failed to realize that most stamp collectors want to collect the stamps that are actually usable and available for postage, and not special creations designed to separate them from their money. They objected strongly to Seebeck's unlimited reprinting rights, the needless yearly creation of new issues, and the issuance of postally-irrelevant stamp values. Stamps with face values up to $10 were issued for the 1892 Columbus anniversary. Although the U.S. and Canada received similar abuse for their 1892 and 1897 stamp series (which included values up to $5), Seebeck's efforts were seen as particularly blatant. Many collectors refused to collect these issues. Several of the countries backed out of their contracts with Seebeck (Honduras in 1893, and Ecuador in 1896) due to the bad publicity and administrative nuisance of the frequently-changing issues. Nicholas Seebeck died June 23, 1899, at the age of 42, in the final year of his contract with El Salvador. Legacy The Hamilton Bank Note Company printed other stamps such as the 1902 issue of Dominican Republic and was still in existence in the 1940s when August Seebeck, Nicholas' grandson was president. However, millions of stamp reprints (and the plates from which they were produced) reached the market. Most of the Hamilton issues, pejoratively known as \\"Seebecks\\", are common and cheap to this day, at least in unused condition. However, many of the original post-1895 issues are scarce, or rare, in unused condition while the reprints abound. In part, this is because it is difficult to tell the stamps shipped for postal sale from the numerous reprints. Postally-used stamps are generally much less common, though the collector of this area needs to beware of forged cancellations.

Though originally a commuter school, the University now guaranteesIf one chooses to live off- campus, while still a student at the Boston campus, re-admittance to on-campus housing is not guaranteed in the future. the option of on-campus housing for four years for all undergraduate students. This is a challenge considering the size of BU's undergraduate population and its urban setting. BU has met this goal every year, often by using area hotels, though since fall 2009, with the completion of its new 960-bed 26-story dorm, the school says it has accommodated all students who wish to live on campus without using hotel space.  Housing versus Residence Life  Boston University operates residences collaboratively through Residence Life and Housing. While the two areas work collaboratively, each department reports to different areas of University leadership. Housing reports to the Vice President of Auxiliary Services and is centered on providing operational and occupancy management. Meanwhile, Residence Life is structured under the Associate Provost and Dean of Students and is centered on providing day-to-day student service, support, and programs based out of local Residence Life offices located near or within each residence. = Housing = Boston University Housing is based at 25 Buick St, and employs a number of full and part-time staff, as well as students who manage the many components that support Housing at Boston University. Housing is responsible for the areas of Residential Safety, housing assignments, room changes, mail, keys (in coordination with local Residence Life offices), university-provided furnishings, appliances in university-owned residences, and the Terrier Card Office. Boston University Housing also works collaboratively with other departments across campus, such as Facilities Management & Planning, and within Auxiliary Services to coordinate laundry, vending, rentals, summer storage, dining services, vending services, and events & conferences. = Residence Life = The Residence Life team delivers a broad range of programs and services to students, including specialty communities, Residence Hall Associations, the Faculty-in-Residence program, crisis intervention, conflict mediation, enforcement of residential rules and regulations, and information about campus resources. Residence Life is one of the few departments at the University with an on-call system that allows staff to be available to assist students, parents, and members of the University community 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and 365 days a year.  Live-in Professional Staff  Residence Life employs 27 live-in workers at the \\"administrator\\" and \\"senior staff\\" level in the following roles: * Assistant Dean of Students and Director of Residence Life * Senior Associate Director of Residence Life * Associate Director of Residence Life for Administration * Associate Director of Residence Life for Student and Staff Development * Assistant Director of Residence Life for Lower Bay State Road * Assistant Director of Residence Life for South Campus * Assistant Director of Residence Life for Upper Bay State Road * Assistant Director of Residence Life for Upper Commonwealth Avenue * Assistant Director of Residence Life for Warren Towers * Assistant Director of Residence Life for West Campus * Residence Hall or Area Directors  Housing selection  Every spring, returning students who have submitted a housing guarantee payment for the ensuing academic year are entered into a lottery to determine their priority in selecting housing. Priority is assigned within classes, with seniors receiving the lowest (best) numbers, and second-semester freshmen the highest. This means the \\"worst\\" senior number is always better than the best junior number, et cetera. Entering freshmen and transfer students are allocated housing based on an online housing questionnaire.  Dining services  Boston University requires that all students living in dormitories be enrolled in a year-long meal plan. The plans offer differing ratios of meals and dining points, depending on which is chosen. Meals are used to gain access to one of the university's three residential dining service locations on an all-you-can-eat basis (at West Campus, Warren Towers, and Marciano Commons) and dining points can be used at designated eateries around campus on a cash basis. A Kosher plan exists which can be used at the Kosher dining hall at the Hillel House. Combined with housing costs, meal plans can cause room and board to be quite expensive. This has created a high demand for on-campus apartment housing, as the University does not require residents with access to a kitchen to purchase a plan (although they may if they so choose). However, the higher price of such housing often offsets any savings. In addition, the main dining halls offer large selections for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and \\"late night\\".  Large dormitories  = Myles Standish Hall = Myles Standish Hall on Beacon Street BU's first large dormitory was a former hotel. The Myles Standish Hotel in Kenmore Square was built in 1925 and was purchased by BU in 1949. Today Myles Standish Hall and the attached Myles Annex (a separate building purchased for housing in 1980 after the closure of Graham Junior College) together house over 730 students. Myles is configured as a semi-suite residence. The typical suite consists of 2 single rooms and 1 double occupancy room sharing a bathroom. Common areas include group study rooms, music practice rooms, a community kitchen and a games room. = Kilachand Hall = Kilachand Hall, previously named Shelton Hall, was built as a Sheraton Hotel in 1923 and bought by BU and converted to dorm space in 1954. Playwright Eugene O'Neill died in suite 401 on the 4th floor of Kilachand Hall. In his honor, the 4th floor was named a specialty housing area called the Writer's Corridor. It is said that this corridor is haunted by the playwright. The building houses 418 residents. The ninth floor consists of a study lounge that provides an impressive view of Cambridge and the Charles River. The Kilachand Hall dining hall was closed after the 2011‚Äì2012 year when a larger dining hall called Marciano Commons opened. = Towers = The Towers is one of the three Boston University dormitories traditionally intended for freshmen and sophomores, the others being Warren Towers and West Campus. The building comprises two towers, each nine floors high and linked at ground level by a single story structure housing common facilities. It is located on the eastern end of campus, next to Wheelock College of Education and Human Development and behind the Questrom School of Business. It appeared in the movie 21 as the dormitory which housed MIT student Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess). = Warren Towers = Warren Towers, the largest dorm on campus, about 600 students in each of its three towers. Access to the building is via escalator to the fourth floor, where the building's dining hall and other amenities are located. The floors 5‚Äì18 are residential floors. The first three floors and basement house a University parking garage and street-level retail establishments. Warren Towers is a mostly first-year student residence, though there is also significant retention of sophomores. The majority of rooms are identical double-occupancy floorplans, the exception being single rooms, the occasional quad, and the corner doubles. Corner doubles are almost twice the size of a standard double room and are coveted by those residents selecting housing in Warren. = West Campus = West Campus' three high-rise dorms overlook Nickerson Field. At the western edge of campus surrounding BU's Nickerson Field is West Campus, with three high-rises each housing well over 600 residents. They are named Claflin, Sleeper, and Rich Hall after BU's founders. Residents of West generally prefer it over other locations and cite its \\"campusy\\" feel and proximity to the Student Village complex and other athletic facilities. Student athletes are abundant here, for that reason. CGS, CFA, and SHA students also tend to prefer living at West Campus, as it is the closest dormitory style residence to those three schools. All the buildings provide students with a study room. = Danielsen Hall = Danielson Hall on Beacon Street Often forgotten, Danielsen Hall actually demarcates the BU campus‚Äô easternmost limit, at its 512 Beacon Street address. Danielsen residents eat at Marciano Commons, or another dining location. However, the dorm does have a kitchen located in the basement. Danielsen, while a bit of a distance from central campus, has the advantage of being closer to the city. Newbury Street, for example is just a few blocks away. The Boston University Shuttle (BUS) picks up in front of Danielsen regularly, making the distance to campus much more tolerable.  Small dormitories, apartments, and suite style = Bay State Road = Bay State Road is now primarily BU student housing.Once an up-and-coming neighborhood of affluent Boston Brahmins, the majority of Bay State Road is now owned by Boston University for housing and office use. Due to their small size, the brownstones on Bay State are inherently suited for use as specialty housing, and many are used in this fashion. When used as a dormitory, most of the Bay State Road residences are divided into double and triple rooms with some singles. Floors also consist of less than 10 students. Most houses have floors that share a bathroom, a room for the resident assistant on the ground floor, and laundry facilities in the basement. Some rooms have private bathrooms. While some of the houses are rather well-worn, BU has undertaken a project that each summer renovates selected residences to restore the Bay State Road houses to their 19th-century appearance and ambience. = South Campus = South Campus is a student residential area south of Commonwealth Avenue and separated from the main campus by the Massachusetts Turnpike. Some of the larger buildings in that area have been converted into dormitories, while the rest of the South campus buildings are apartments. All were originally constructed as commercial apartment buildings and later purchased by the University. Aside from the characteristic red plaques at their entrances, South Campus buildings are indistinguishable from the other private residences in the area. Since there are no central dining facilities in the South Campus area, students from these dormitories can dine at Warren Towers or other facilities on the main campus. = 10 Buick Street = The 2008 26-story tower of Student Village juxtaposed to the 1960s dorms of West Campus Boston University's principle apartment- style housing area is officially called 10 Buick Street, a part of the John Hancock Student Village project which includes the adjacent Fitness and Recreation Center and the Agganis Arena. Students most commonly refer to this residence as the \\"Student Village\\", or \\"StuVi\\" (pronounced stoo-vee) for short. The apartments at 10 Buick Street are open to juniors and seniors only, and house more than 800 students in apartments. Each apartment has either two or four private bedrooms, one or two common bathrooms (one for doubles, two for quads), a common living room, and a common kitchen. The building has two towers that are connected up to the ninth floor and rise separately to 18 floors in West Tower and 15 floors in East tower. The West Tower has apartments on floors 1‚Äì17, the 18th floor is the Student Atrium with stunning views of Boston and the Charles River. The East Tower has residences on floors 2‚Äì15, with the 1st floor being a marketplace. The 10 Buick Street Market and Cafe, open from 7 a.m. to midnight daily, has a soup & salad bar, a small selection of household items, drinks and snacks, as well as sandwiches and bagels ready-to-order. The basement also provides amenities such as laundry, mailboxes, a study lounge, as well as numerous smaller study and music rooms. In 2003, the Director of the Student Village, Laura De Veau, began publishing a monthly newsletter for residents called The Villager. In 2004, her successor, Brian Sirman, redesigned the publication to include recipes, a quiz, and \\"Ask Adrienne\\" (an advice column written by the Senior Resident Assistant, Adrienne Kisner). Since August 2004, The Villager has been printed bi-weekly. Ten Buick Street is the only on-campus residence at Boston University to feature a publication of this type. = 33 Harry Agganis Way = Boston University's newest residence, which opened in the fall of 2009, accommodates 960 residents in two towers. The 26-story tower houses juniors and seniors in an apartment-style setting. These apartments are two-bedroom apartments for two students, or four-bedroom apartments for four students. All apartments have one bathroom, one living room, and one kitchen. The 19-story tower houses sophomores, juniors and seniors residing in suite (dormitory- style) settings. The suites house eight students each; half of the residents reside in four single bedrooms, while the other half occupy two double bedrooms. Each suite has two bathrooms and one living room. = 1019 Commonwealth Avenue = Located across the street from West Campus, 1019 is suite-style housing without kitchens. Thus, residents eat at the West Campus dining hall. The suites have three double rooms which share a bathroom and common room. During the summer, Boston University sometimes uses 1019 as temporary lodging for conference attendees and other visitors. = Fenway Campus = Boston University's Fenway Campus is located in the Riverway area near South Campus. The campus is composed of multiple undergraduate and graduate residences: Riverway House, Pilgrim House, and Campus Center & Student Residence. These residences include dorm-style and suite-style rooms with single, double, triple, and quadruple occupancy. They also offer study lounges, laundry rooms, vending machines, internet access, and a dining hall (located at Campus Center Student Residence).  Other housing locations  Aside from these main residential areas, smaller residential dormitories are scattered along Commonwealth Avenue between main school buildings, including 722-728 Commonwealth Avenue, located across from CVS on St. Mary's street. = Hotels: The Hyatt and Holiday Inn Brookline = Due to housing capacity shortages, many incoming students are temporarily housed in hotels during the fall semester. These hotels include the Hyatt Regency Cambridge on the opposite bank of the Charles, and the Holiday Inn Brookline, both a manageable walk to main campus with free shuttle bus service provided to students in the Hyatt. = 575 Commonwealth Avenue = One of the hotels frequently used in this way was the former Howard Johnson's hotel at 575 Commonwealth Avenue, next to the Questrom School of Business' Rafik Hariri Building. In 2001, the University closed the hotel (which it owned) and converted the building into a full-time dormitory, now known as 575 Commonwealth Avenue. Rooms are commonly divided into triples, although there are a few doubles and singles. Every room comes with its own bathroom and air conditioning, a luxury not present in most rooms on campus. This 8-story building, not including the basement, includes the first floor lobby, 6 floors for bedroom dorms, and an eight floor study area. The first floor lobby also has two lounge areas, where students can choose to study or hang out by playing pool or watching TV. Students lovingly refer to it as either 575 or the HoJo.  Specialty housing  Boston University also provides specialty houses or specialty floors to students who have particular interests. The Common Ground House on Bay State Road is a house designed for those wanting to live in an emphatically multi-background setting. A special application is required prior to general housing decisions in order to be considered for specialty housing. Bay State Road also has brownstones for students in the College of General Studies, Management, Music, Sargent College, Education and Trustee Scholars. There are also specialty floors in large dormitories, such as Core Curricular program, Women in Science and Engineering, same-sex floors, etc.  Security  All large dormitories have 24/7 security and require all students to swipe and show their school identification before entering. Bay State Road brownstones and many of the apartment-style residences on South Campus (such as those on Park Drive and Buswell Street) have locked front doors that require students to have cards or keys to the front door. Every dormitory has at least one resident advisor. Large dorms have at least one on each floor. The security system on campus (while safe and effective) was considered a nuisance by the student population prior to a major overhaul which took effect in Fall 2007. Students (and residents) of Boston University could not enter a dorm other than their own after 8 p.m. without being signed in, and were expected to leave the premises (unless allocated for a special study session, called a \\"study extension\\") by 2 a.m. Study extensions allowed students who live on campus to remain in a dormitory other than their own until 7 a.m., at which time they were required to sign out of the building. Starting in September 2007, a new guest policy relaxed most of the rules that have frustrated Boston University students. The new policy allows for overnight guests to be signed in until 2 a.m. of the first night of the stay with consent of a student's roommate. Previously the guest policy did not permit overnight guest approval to occur less than 24 hours prior to the beginning of the stay. In addition, there is now a difference in the guest policy for those students living in the mostly freshman/sophomore dorms versus those living in the Student Village (10 Buick Street and 33 Agganis Way), an exclusively upperclassman apartment complex. Residents of the Student Village will be allowed to have guests at any time of the day without any approval process, as long as the guest is accompanied by a Student Village resident. The new policy is likely to increase the percentage of students who want to live on campus, which is already a substantial majority of the undergraduate population.  Capacity problems  Between 2002 and 2008, The University has been criticized for overbooking its housing for the fall semester as a result of its large student population and its guarantee of on-campus housing for four years. As a result, many freshmen were shunted to nearby hotels to accommodate the overflow. BU's Daily Free Press often published articles relating to the university's inability to provide acceptable housing for its students. With the opening of StuVi-II in Fall 2009, the school's 960-bed 19 and 26 story towers, BU says it will be able to house the nearly 80 percent of its 16,000 undergraduates who want to live on campus without using hotels. In the past, the Boston University Office of Housing was criticized for reserving a certain percentage of each dormitory for underclasses. This caused complaints from upperclassmen who were relegated to living in substandard housing due to spots in prime housing being taken by freshmen and sophomores, squeezing the upperclassmen out of the already crowded, at the time, housing system. Additionally, some freshmen placed into predominantly upperclassmen dorms are unsatisfied with their assignments because of the difficulty of engaging with other underclassmen in these locations.

He served as Archbishop of Tamale from 1974 to 1994 and was elevated to the cardinalate in 2006. Porekuu had also served as the Bishop of Wa prior to his elevation as archbishop. The cause for his canonization commenced in mid-2013 and the late cardinal is now referred to as a Servant of God. Life =Education and priesthood= The bishop- elect in the generalate of the Missionaries of Africa in Rome on the eve of his episcopal consecration in 1960. Alongside him is a Ghanaian nun and the priest John McNulty who was the originator of the credit union movement in Africa. Porekuu Der was born in 1918 Zimuopare in the Ko Parish as the fourth of ten children to Theodore Porekuu and Agnes Zoore in the house of his uncle Ngmankurinaa. He was born soon after the death of his immediate older brother. One other brother was Alipo Porekuu. The belief and practice of the Dagaare speaking people of North-Western Ghana and Southern Burkina-Faso dictates that a male child born not long after the death of his immediate elder brother is believed to be the reincarnation of the deceased brother and was thus given the additional name \\"Der\\" to demonstrate that. In keeping with that belief and practice his pagan parents thus referred to him as such. He later converted to Roman Catholicism being baptized (alongside ten others) in Jirapa on 24 December 1932. He then altered his name \\"Der\\" with a \\"Y\\" at the end while taking the name \\"Peter\\" in honor of Saint Peter. In 1932, he was sent to Jirapa to become a catechist, so he could return to his village to teach his people in the faith. Porekuu studied for the priesthood in Navrongo from 1934 to 1939 prior to commencing his philosophical and theological studies at Saint Victor's school in Wiagha. He received his ordination to the priesthood in Nandom at Saint Theresa's Church from Bishop G√©rard Bertrand in 1951 before furthering his studies. He earned a diploma in social studies from the Saint Francis Xavier college in Antigonish in Canada in 1958 and also obtained his doctorate from the International Catechetical Institute \\"Lumen vitae\\" in Brussels in Belgium. The former permitted him to enter after the Knights of Columbus granted him a scholarship in 1957. He returned to his homeland in 1959 serving as a parochial vicar in Nandom before serving as the vicar- general for the Tamale archdiocese until 1960. =Episcopate= On 16 March 1960 he was appointed as the first Bishop of Wa after Pope John XXIII created the new diocese. He received his episcopal consecration two months later from John XXIII himself with Bishops Napol√©on-Alexandre Labrie and Venerable Fulton Sheen serving as the co-consecrators in Saint Peter's Basilica. Poreku made his formal installation in his new see on the following 10 June and then requested permission from competent ecclesial authorities in Rome to translate the Mass into Dagaare and have it sung in local melodies with local musical instruments; permission was given, and he composed the first Dagaare Mass. This proved to be a significant milestone in the \\"Africanization\\" of the Ghanaian Church. Porekuu attended the Second Vatican Council and focused on the involvement of the faithful as well as both education and the promotion of vocations during his tenure. He was remembered in Wa for driving a Datsun saloon car with foodstuffs from Wa to Accra on terrible roads just, so he could meet with the families of his old parishioners and to distribute food to people. He was later named as the Apostolic Administrator for the Tamale archdiocese and later became the fourth Bishop of Tamale on 18 November 1974. He was the first non-religious to hold the position since all his predecessors had belonged to the White Fathers. He was promoted to the rank of a metropolitan archbishop upon Tamale's elevation to an archdiocese in 1977. From 1982 to 1988 he served as the president of the Ghanaian Episcopal Conference. Porekuu attended two sessions of episcopal gatherings that Pope John Paul II had convoked with the first being held from 24 November to 8 December 1985 and the second being held from 1 to 30 October 1987. It was at the former that he said Roman officials should allow for \\"enculturation\\" to allow for the Ghanaian Church to assume its own cultural sense of identification in \\"matters of life and worship\\". Porekuu also served two terms on the Pontifical Council for the Laity during the pontificates of both Paul VI and John Paul II. He resigned from his position on 26 March 1994 after two decades of service and upon reaching the retirement age. The resignation letter was sent in 1993 but was not accepted after the pope responded \\"nunc pro tunc\\" meaning \\"not until we can replace\\" with a new archbishop. But the resignation was accepted not long after in 1994 after Porekuu suffered a stroke. =Cardinalate= Pope Benedict XVI created Porekuu as the Cardinal- Deacon of Sant'Elena fuori Porta Prenestina on 26 March 2006 in Saint Peter's Square; he was elevated as one of the prelates over age 80 meaning that he was not eligible to vote in future papal conclaves. Porekuu was in a wheelchair and was lifted onto the dais to greet Benedict XVI who conferred the red hat and title upon him. =Death and funeral= Porekuu died in his sleep at his Tamale residence on 6 March 2008 at 6:20 pm. His longtime aide Mark Attabeh and his doctor Augustine Kabir aided him in his final months. He had been bedridden for the last seven months of his life after slipping in 2007 causing hip difficulties. His remains were taken to the morgue before being taken to the archdiocesan cathedral to lie in state. On 31 March a vigil was held at Jubilee Park with Cardinal Peter Turkson presiding over the funeral on 1 April; the President John Kufuor and Vice-President Aliu Mahama were in attendance with Archbishop Peter Akwasi Sarpong delivering the sermon and Felix Owusu Adjepong delivering a tribute on the government's behalf. Recognitions Porekuu was granted several awards and recognitions during his life: * State Award of Grand Medal (civil division) ‚Äì granted on 13 January 1974. * Honorary Doctor of Law (from his old college in Canada) * Order of the Star of Ghana ‚Äì granted in 2007. Beatification In June 2013 at a memorial service Mass held in Tamale it was announced that the cause for beatification would be initiated with the formal request lodged to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints on 15 June 2013. The \\"nihil obstat\\" (no objections) was declared on 13 July 2013 which allowed for Porekuu to be titled as a Servant of God. The diocesan process commenced on 9 May 2015 in Tamale and was tasked with assembling documentation on his life and works as well as collecting testimonies from those who knew the late cardinal. As of June 2016 a total of 45 people had been interviewed as part of the process. Testimonies were heard in Tamale and Damongo as well as in Yendi and Navrongo- Bolgatanga with successive sessions to be heard in Wa. The current postulator for this cause is Dr. Waldery Hilgeman.

each Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1846. The first Prime Minister was Robert Walpole in the early 18th century . Unlike countries where the leader is elected directly to the highest political office of a separate executive, the Prime Minister must first establish a political career in the UK Parliament and typically serves many years in the House of Commons before becoming Prime Minister, and in some cases for many years afterwards. Since the Marquess of Salisbury in 1895, all time in parliamentary service before being Prime Minister has been in the House of Commons, apart from Sir Alec Douglas-Home's period as a member of the Government while in the House of Lords (1951‚Äì63; though he was previously the elected member for Lanark, 1931-1945). After becoming Prime Minister, Douglas- Home returned to the Commons by winning a by-election on the recess death of MP Gilmour Leburn. =Key= * Each dark coloured bar denotes the time spent as Prime

circles. Every blue circle intersects every red circle at a right angle. Every red circle passes through the two points, C and D, and every blue circle separates the two points. Apollonian circles are two families of circles such that every circle in the first family intersects every circle in the second family orthogonally, and vice versa. These circles form the basis for bipolar coordinates. They were discovered by Apollonius of Perga, a renowned Greek geometer. Definition The Apollonian circles are defined in two different ways by a line segment denoted CD. Each circle in the first family (the blue circles in the figure) is associated with a positive real number r, and is defined as the locus of points X such that the ratio of distances from X to C and to D equals r, :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{X\\\\mid \\\\frac{d(X,C)}{d(X,D)} = r\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. For values of r close to zero, the corresponding circle is close to C, while for values of r close to ‚àû, the corresponding circle is close to D; for the intermediate value r = 1, the circle degenerates to a line, the perpendicular bisector of CD. The equation defining these circles as a locus can be generalized to define the Fermat‚ÄìApollonius circles of larger sets of weighted points. Each circle in the second family (the red circles in the figure) is associated with an angle Œ∏, and is defined as the locus of points X such that the inscribed angle CXD equals Œ∏, :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{X\\\\mid \\\\; C\\\\hat{X}D \\\\; = \\\\theta\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. Scanning Œ∏ from 0 to œÄ generates the set of all circles passing through the two points C and D. The two points where all the red circles cross are the limiting points of pairs of circles in the blue family. Bipolar coordinates A given blue circle and a given red circle intersect in two points. In order to obtain bipolar coordinates, a method is required to specify which point is the right one. An isoptic arc is the locus of points X that sees points C and D under a given oriented angle of vectors i.e. :isopt(\\\\theta)=\\\\\\\\{X\\\\mid \\\\angle( \\\\overrightarrow{XC}, \\\\overrightarrow{XD} )=\\\\theta +2k\\\\pi\\\\\\\\}. Such an arc is contained into a red circle and is bounded by points C and D. The remaining part of the corresponding red circle is isopt(\\\\theta+\\\\pi). When we really want the whole red circle, a description using oriented angles of straight lines has to be used : {\\\\rm full\\\\;red\\\\;circle}=\\\\\\\\{X\\\\mid \\\\angle( \\\\overrightarrow{XC}, \\\\overrightarrow{XD} )=\\\\theta +k\\\\pi\\\\\\\\} Pencils of circles Both of the families of Apollonian circles are pencils of circles. Each is determined by any two of its members, called generators of the pencil. Specifically, one is an elliptic pencil (red family of circles in the figure) that is defined by two generators that pass through each other in exactly two points (C and D). The other is a hyperbolic pencil (blue family of circles in the figure) that is defined by two generators that do not intersect each other at any point.. =Radical axis and central line= Any two of these circles within a pencil have the same radical axis, and all circles in the pencil have collinear centers. Any three or more circles from the same family are called coaxial circles or coaxal circles.MathWorld uses ‚Äúcoaxal,‚Äù while prefer ‚Äúcoaxial.‚Äù The elliptic pencil of circles passing through the two points C and D (the set of red circles, in the figure) has the line CD as its radical axis. The centers of the circles in this pencil lie on the perpendicular bisector of CD. The hyperbolic pencil defined by points C and D (the blue circles) has its radical axis on the perpendicular bisector of line CD, and all its circle centers on line CD. Inversive geometry, orthogonal intersection, and coordinate systems Circle inversion transforms the plane in a way that maps circles into circles, and pencils of circles into pencils of circles. The type of the pencil is preserved: the inversion of an elliptic pencil is another elliptic pencil, the inversion of a hyperbolic pencil is another hyperbolic pencil, and the inversion of a parabolic pencil is another parabolic pencil. It is relatively easy to show using inversion that, in the Apollonian circles, every blue circle intersects every red circle orthogonally, i.e., at a right angle. Inversion of the blue Apollonian circles with respect to a circle centered on point C results in a pencil of concentric circles centered at the image of point D. The same inversion transforms the red circles into a set of straight lines that all contain the image of D. Thus, this inversion transforms the bipolar coordinate system defined by the Apollonian circles into a polar coordinate system. Obviously, the transformed pencils meet at right angles. Since inversion is a conformal transformation, it preserves the angles between the curves it transforms, so the original Apollonian circles also meet at right angles. Alternatively,, p. 59. the orthogonal property of the two pencils follows from the defining property of the radical axis, that from any point X on the radical axis of a pencil P the lengths of the tangents from X to each circle in P are all equal. It follows from this that the circle centered at X with length equal to these tangents crosses all circles of P perpendicularly. The same construction can be applied for each X on the radical axis of P, forming another pencil of circles perpendicular to P. More generally, for every pencil of circles there exists a unique pencil consisting of the circles that are perpendicular to the first pencil. If one pencil is elliptic, its perpendicular pencil is hyperbolic, and vice versa; in this case the two pencils form a set of Apollonian circles. The pencil of circles perpendicular to a parabolic pencil is also parabolic; it consists of the circles that have the same common tangent point but with a perpendicular tangent line at that point..

The Ho-103 achieved a higher rate of fire by using a smaller, lower velocity Breda (Vickers) cartridge, intermediate in length between the WWII German 13 mm calibre MG 131's 64mm length cartridge, and the long 99mm cartridge of the veteran American M2 Browning .50 calibre gun. Because of this, the gun was frequently loaded with explosive or incendiary ammunition in an attempt to increase terminal effects on aircraft. Types of ammunition used by this gun are: \\\\- Ball, marked with a pink/red seal around the casemouth. \\\\- Two types of Amrour Piercing Tracer, marked with a black (red tracer) or green and white (white tracer) seal around the casemouth. \\\\- Ma 102 Fuseless Explosive Incendiary, marked with a dark purple seal around the casemouth. \\\\- Ma 103 Fuzed Explosive Incendiary, marked with a clear (single piece fuze) or white (2-piece fuze) seal around the casemouth.Japanese Ammunition 1880-1945 vol. 1, Ken Elks, Some examples of Ho-103 cartridges.

Variants The Type 1 was produced in two variants. The Ho-103 was used in fixed installations, while the Ho-104 was used in flexible installations. Design The 12.7√ó81mmSR allowed the Type 1 to fire at a rate of 900 RPM, but the poor suitability of the Browning action to synchronization reduced the rate of fire to 400 RPM in synchronized installations. However, the Japanese source and Allied Intelligence reports did not mention that this machine gun had a propeller synchronization flaw. The source for the Bell P-63 Kingcobra also doesn't mention the propeller synchronization flaw in the browning design.

She was named after the Isuzu River, near Ise Shrine in the Ch≈´bu region of Japan. She saw action during World War II in the Battle of Hong Kong and in the Solomon Islands campaign, and the Battle of Leyte Gulf before being sunk by American submarines in the Netherlands East Indies in April 1945. Background Following the production of the five s, an additional three 5,500-ton class light cruisers authorized under the 8-4 Fleet Program were ordered by the Imperial Japanese Navy in 1920. Due to minor changes in design, primarily due to advances in torpedo technology, these three vessels were initially designated as \\"modified Kuma-class\\", or \\"5500-ton class Type II\\", before being re-designated as a separate class named after the lead vessel, . A second set of three vessels was authorized in late 1920.Stille, Imperial Japanese Navy Light Cruisers 1941-45 , page 22-26; Design The Nagara-class vessels were essentially identical to the previous Kuma-class cruisers, retaining the same hull design, engines and main weaponry, with the addition of the new 610 mm Type 93 Long Lance Torpedoes, which required a larger launcher.Gardner, Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1906‚Äì1921; page 238 However, in silhouette, a major difference from the Kuma class was in the configuration of the bridge, which incorporated an aircraft hangar. Initially, a platform was mounted above the No.2 turret, extending over the forward superstructure below the bridge. This was later replaced by an aircraft catapult. Even so, the arrangement proved unwieldy, and the catapult was moved to the rear of each ship in the class, between the No.5 and No.6 turrets during retrofits in 1929-1934. Isuzu underwent a number of wartime modifications to increase her number of anti-aircraft guns, and to replace her twin torpedo launchers with a single quadruple aft mount. From May ‚Äì September 1944, she was converted into a dedicated anti-aircraft cruiser, during which her entire main battery, torpedo launchers and aircraft catapults were removed, and replaced by three twin-mount 12.7 cm/40 Type 89 naval guns, and a Type 94 high angle fire control system and Type 13 and Type 22 radars were added. Service career =Early career= Isuzu was laid down on 10 August 1920, launched on 29 October 1921 and completed at the Uraga Dock Company on 15 August 1923. From August to December 1928, she was under the command of Captain Isoroku Yamamoto, and from November 1929 to December 1930 under the command of Captain Shir≈ç Takasu. Shortly after completion, Isuzu was assigned to patrol duty on the Yangtze River. As the war situation with China continued to deteriorate, Isuzu was sent to patrol the coasts of central China, and to cover landings of Japanese troops in southern China. From December 1936 to December 1937, Isuzu was commanded by Captain Tamon Yamaguchi. =Early stages of the Pacific War= At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Isuzu was participating in the invasion of Hong Kong, as part of the 15th Escort Squadron in Vice Admiral Kiyoshi Hara's Second China Expeditionary Fleet. Isuzu remained based in Hong Kong after its capture by Japan from the end of December 1941 to April 1942, returning briefly to her home port of Mako, in the Pescadores to escort reinforcements for the Japanese 25th Army to Singora, Thailand and Camranh Bay, French Indochina CombinedFleet.com: Isuzu Tabular Record of Movement; The 15th Escort Squadron was deactivated on 10 April 1942 and Isuzu was reassigned to Rear Admiral Kenzaburo Hara's CruDiv 16 under Vice Admiral Ib≈ç Takahashi's 2nd Southern Expeditionary Fleet. She was joined by the and and was assigned a patrol area in the Dutch East Indies extending from Makassar, Celebes to Balikpapan, Borneo and Surabaya, Java, becoming flagship of CruDiv 16 from 1 May 1942. On 28 June 1942, Isuzu returned to Yokosuka Naval Arsenal for repairs and overhaul, which was completed in time for Isuzu to participate in the Banda Sea Operation on 26 July 1942, where she supported landing operations of Japanese forces on the Tanimbar Islands. In August, 1942, Isuzu was reassigned to the Indian Ocean theatre, patrolling between Singapore, Mergui, Burma, Sabang Harbor, Sumatra and Penang, Malaya; however, on 24 August 1942, Isuzu was reassigned back to Makassar. =The Solomon Islands campaigns= On 16 September 1942, Isuzu and Kinu were assigned to escort the first wave of transports with Lieutenant General Masao Maruyama's 2nd Infantry Division from Batavia for the Solomon Islands (Rabaul, New Britain and Shortland Island and Bougainville). From Shortland, Isuzu was ordered on to Truk, in the Caroline Islands, where it replaced the damaged as flagship of Rear Admiral Raizo Tanaka's DesRon 2's DesDivs 15, 24 and 31 (9 destroyers). From 11‚Äì12 October 1942, it led DesDiv 31 against Guadalcanal, accompanied by the battleships and and aircraft carriers and , CruDiv 4's , and CruDiv 5's . Isuzu provided cover with DesDivs 15 and 31 and also fired on Marine batteries on Tulagi Island during the Bombardment of Henderson Field, Guadalcanal by the Kong≈ç and Haruna. On 24‚Äì25 October 1942, Isuzu participated in the Battle of Santa Cruz, but was not damaged. On 3‚Äì5 November 1942, she escorted transports with reinforcements for the 38th Infantry Division to Shortland. Isuzu also participated in the second Naval Battle of Guadalcanal on 13 November 1942. She sustained two near misses from Marine SBD Dauntless dive-bombers. Her No. 3 boiler room flooded and her speed was reduced to . She was assisted by the destroyer and returned to Shortland for emergency repairs, probably by the repair ship Yamabiko Maru. Additional repairs were performed at Truk on 20 November 1942, but Isuzu was forced to retire to Yokosuka, arriving 14 December 1942. At the Mitsubishi Yokohama shipyard, Isuzu was repaired and modified with the installation of a Type 21 air-search radar. The No. 7 14 cm/50 3rd Year Type naval gun was replaced by an unshielded twin 12.7 cm/40 Type 89 naval gunmount. The No. 5 gun was removed. Two triple 25-mm mounts were added bringing the light AA suite to ten 25-mm AA mounts and one quadruple Type 93 13.2 mm machine gun in front of bridge. On 1 April 1943, with repairs and modification yet incomplete, Isuzu was assigned to Rear Admiral Kenzo Ito's new CruDiv 14 with Naka. Isuzu was finally able to depart Yokosuka on 21 May 1943, returning to Truk with supplies and troop reinforcements on 21 June 1943. She was then assigned to ferry troops for the occupation of Nauru on 25 June 1943. Isuzu continued to be based out of Truk to 15 October 1943, when it was recalled to Tokushima and (together with Naka) reassigned to ferry troops to Shanghai. On 23 October 1943 Isuzu was attacked in the East China Sea by the submarine , which fired ten torpedoes, but failed to hit either Isuzu or Naka. Isuzu returned to Truk on 28 October 1943 and was assigned to escort a convoy of troops for Kavieng, New Ireland. The convoy was attacked north of Kavieng by USAAF 13th Air Force B-24 Liberator bombers, and Isuzu was damaged by a mine laid by the submarine , suffering hull damage forward disabling two gun mounts. Isuzu returned to Rabaul for repairs and was thus in Rabaul harbor during the 5 November 1943 American Carrier Raid on Rabaul. However, the planes from Task Force 38's aircraft carriers and did little more than strafe Isuzu, which later returned to Truk for repairs. =Operations in South Pacific= On 20 November 1943, the United States launched \\"Operation Galvanic\\" to retake the Gilbert Islands. Isuzu ferried troops from Ponape to Kwajalein and Mili (Mille). While at Roi, on 5 December 1943, Isuzu was attacked by Douglas SBD Dauntless dive-bombers and Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo-bombers from TG 50.1's aircraft carriers and . Repairs were conducted at Kwajalein and Truk, but Isuzu was forced to withdraw once again to Yokosuka on 17 January 1944. While back in Japan, Isuzu was converted to an anti-aircraft cruiser at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. All of her remaining 14 cm/50 3rd Year Type naval guns were removed and two additional twin 12.7 cm/40 Type 89 naval guns were installed. The number of Type 96 25 mm AA guns was increased to 50 barrels. The catapult and seaplane equipment were removed. Type 13 air-search, Type 21 air-search and Type 22 surface-search radars were fitted or modified. Sonar and depth charge rails were added. On 20 August 1944, Isuzu became flagship of Rear Admiral Heitaro Edo's CruDiv 31 (antisubmarine), and Isuzu was declared combat ready again on 14 September 1944. =Battle of Leyte Gulf= On 20 October 1944, Isuzu participated in the Battle of Leyte Gulf as part of Vice Admiral Jisabur≈ç Ozawa's Northern Mobile (\\"Decoy\\") Force. In the Battle off Cape Engano on 25 October 1944 ‚Äì 26 October 1944 Ozawa's force was attacked by TBM-1C aircraft of VT-21 from TG 38.4's aircraft carrier and VT-51 from . The aircraft carrier was hit heavily and Isuzu unsuccessfully attempted to take the ship in tow. After Chitose sank, Isuzu rescued 480 survivors. Later the same day, Isuzu attempted to protect the , which was damaged by a second strike by aircraft from Lexington and . However, a force of four US cruisers and nine destroyers appeared on scene and sank Chiyoda with all hands. While rescuing survivors, Isuzu itself came under fire from the American units and 13 crewmembers were killed. Isuzu returned to Okinawa on 27 October 1944, and from there to Kure, where she was assigned to make a troop transport run to Manila and Brunei. On 19 November 1944, west of Corregidor, Isuzu was attacked by and hit by one of six torpedoes fired, with severe damage to its stern and destroying her rudder. After at-sea emergency repairs, Isuzu limped into Singapore for temporary repairs. =Operations in the Dutch East Indies= After temporary repairs, Isuzu was transferred to Surabaya for more complete repair work on 10 December 1944. When repairs were completed, on 4 April 1945, Isuzu was sent to transport an army detachment from Kupang to Sumbawa Island. She was spotted by a wolf pack with the submarines , and , which was joined by . On 6 April 1945, Isuzu was attacked north of Sumbawa by ten B-25 Mitchell bombers of No. 18 (Netherlands East Indies) Squadron RAAF, based at Batchelor Airfield south of Darwin, Australia. Isuzu was slightly damaged by near misses off her starboard bow by some of the 60 bombs dropped. Later on 6 April, she landed troops at Bima Bay, on the northeast coast of Sumbawa. Afterwards, while withdrawing near Flores, Isuzu was hit in the bow section by bombs from B-24 Liberator bombers, from No. 21 Squadron RAAF and No. 24 Squadron RAAF, based in the Northern Territory of Australia. Two B-24s were shot down by Imperial Japanese Army Air Force fighters. Between Sumbawa and Komodo Islands, USS Besugo fired nine torpedoes at the Isuzu group. Isuzu was undamaged, and one Japanese minesweeper was sunk. The following day, 7 April 1945, northwest of Bima, Isuzu was struck by one of five torpedoes fired by USS Gabilan. The torpedo hit portside, below the bridge, causing flooding forward. Isuzus speed fell below , she took on a list and settled by the bow. While her crew was performing emergency repairs, USS Charr fired four torpedoes, hitting Isuzu portside twice near the aft engine room.

On the same day, just a few hours apart, the battleship and her escorts were sunk by US aircraft in an attempted suicide attack on Okinawa. Isuzu was removed from the Navy List on 20 June 1945.

The ship was named after the Natori River in Miyagi prefecture, Japan. Natori was the third vessel completed in the Nagara class of light cruisers. Like other vessels of her class, she was intended for use as the flagship of a destroyer flotilla. Construction and career =Early career= Natori was completed at Mitsubishi's Nagasaki shipyard on 15 September 1922. Soon after commissioning, Natori was assigned to patrols off the China coast. From 1938, the cruiser was based in Taiwan, and helped cover the landings of Japanese troops in southern China. In 1940, a border dispute between Siam and French Indochina erupted into armed conflict. A Japanese-sponsored \\"Conference for the Cessation of Hostilities\\" was held at Saigon and preliminary documents for a cease-fire between the governments of General Philippe P√©tain's Vichy France and the Kingdom of Siam were signed aboard Natori on January 31, 1941. =Early stages of the Pacific War= On 26 November 1941, Natori became flagship of Rear Admiral Kenzaburo Hara's Destroyer Squadron 5 under Vice Admiral Ibo Takahashi's Third Fleet and was assigned to the No.1 Surprise Attack Unit of the Philippine Seizure Force. At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Natori was escorting six transports carrying elements of the IJA's 48th Infantry Division from Mako, Pescadores to Aparri, northern Luzon. The landing force was attacked by three USAAF B-17 Flying Fortress bombers of the 14th Squadron on 10 December 1941, which damaged Natori and the escorting destroyer with near misses. After repairs at Mako, Natori ferried 27 transports with the 47th Infantry Regiment of the 48th Infantry Division and the 4th Tank Regiment to Lingayen Gulf in late December. On 26 December 1941, Natori was reassigned to the No. 2 Escort Unit with the light cruiser , and tasked with escorting 43 transports of the Third Malaya Convoy to Singora. =Battle of the Sunda Strait= Natori was later assigned escort duties to cover the invasion force for the Dutch East Indies, and participated in the Battle of Sunda Strait on 28 February 1942. Natori with Destroyer Division 5's , Destroyer Division 11's , , Destroyer Division 12's and and Destroyer Division 27's with Cruiser Division 7's and deployed north and west of the landing areas. The heavy cruiser and the light cruiser sortied for Tjilatjap via the Sunda Strait and attacked Japanese troop transports screened only by , and . The destroyers made smoke to mask the transports. Fubuki charged Houston and Perth and launched torpedoes. At 2300, the Third Escort Force's Natori and her destroyers arrived with the Western Support Force's Mogami, Mikuma and . Shiratsuyu opened fire on the Allies. Natori, with Hatsuyuki and Shirayuki, then opened fire and rapidly closed the range. At 2308, the Allied cruisers turned northeast and Natori and her destroyers headed southeast in three columns. Between 2310 and 2319 they launched 28 torpedoes at the Allies. Perths gunfire damaged Harukazes rudder and Shirayukis bridge. At 2319, Mikuma and Mogami each fired six Type 93 \\"Long Lance\\" torpedoes at Perth from about and opened main battery fire from about , assisted by searchlights on their destroyers. At 2327, Mogami fired six Long Lances at Houston. They missed, but hit the Army transports Sakura Maru, Horai Maru, Tatsuno Maru and the Commander-in-Chief of the invading Japanese 16th Army, Lieutenant General Hitoshi Imamura's transport Ryujo Maru. At 2326, Harukaze and Hatakaze launched torpedoes. At 2330, Shirakumo and Murakumo also launched torpedoes. Altogether, the Japanese launched about 90 torpedoes in the engagement. Perth, low on ammunition, was making when the first torpedo hit her forward engine room. Two more torpedoes hit her forward magazine and aft under \\"X\\" turret, and she sank east-northeast of St. Nicholas Point at after a fourth torpedo hit. At 0045, Houston sank at . On 10 March 1942, Natori was assigned to Cruiser Division 16 with the light cruiser . After the occupation of Java, Natori participated in the Battle of Christmas Island. At Christmas Island on 1 April 1942 the submarine fired three torpedoes at Natori, but all missed. The cruiser which was hit starboard near her No. 1 boiler was not so lucky, and had to be towed back to Bantam Bay by Natori. In April, Natori was assigned to patrols of the Java Sea, which continued into June. After a refit back at Maizuru, Natori returned to the Java Sea and Timor Sea until December, with occasional calls at Mergui in Burma, Penang, Singapore and Davao. On 21 December 1942, Natori embarked a Special Naval Landing Force, which it disembarked at Hollandia, New Guinea. On 9 January 1943, southeast of Ambon, Natori was sighted by the submarine at about . Tautog fired two torpedoes which hit Natori in the stern. It broke off and carried away her rudder. In the next few minutes, as Natori got underway at reduced speed, Tautog fired two more torpedoes, but they either missed or were duds and Natori managed to escape. Refitting On 21 January 1943, while at Ambon, Natori was damaged by a near-miss starboard side by a bomb dropped by a Consolidated Aircraft B-24 Liberator bomber of the 90th Bomb Group's 319th Bomb Squadron. The bomb opened plates and caused the No. 2 boiler room to flood. Natori departed Ambon that day for repairs at Makassar, but repair proved impossible, so Natori continued on to Seletar Naval Base, Singapore. Repairs were not completed until 24 May 1943, but by then a decision was made to send Natori back to Japan for further repairs and modernization At Maizuru Naval Arsenal, Natoris No. 5 and No. 7 140 mm guns were removed as were her catapult and derrick. A twin Type 89 127 mm HA gun was fitted, as were two triple mount Type 96 25 mm AA guns. This brought Natoris 25 mm AA suite to fourteen barrels (2√ó3, 2√ó2, 4√ó1). A Type 21 air-search radar was fitted and hydrophones were installed at her bow. Repairs and modernization were completed on 1 April 1944, and Natori was assigned as the flagship of the Central Pacific Fleet's Destroyer Squadron 3. =Actions in the Philippines= On 5 June 1944, Natori embarked an Imperial Japanese Army detachment from Kure to Davao, Mindanao where the cruiser disembarked the Army detachment and embarked other troops for Palau, arriving on 17 June 1944 (the day before the Battle of the Philippine Sea. Natori remained at Davao in late June through August as a guard ship. On 20 July 1944, the submarine patrolling off Davao spotted Natori making , but was unable to gain a favorable firing position. Natori arrived in Palau 21 July 1944 to help evacuate 800 Japanese and Korean \\"comfort women\\" to Davao. On 18 August 1944, east of Samar, Natori was accompanying the transport T.3 to Palau when they were spotted by the submarine east of San Bernardino Strait. Hardhead identified the target as a battleship and closed for a surface attack. One torpedo of its first salvo of five Mark 23 torpedoes fired at hit Natori portside in a boiler room. She stopped dead in the water and was hit starboard amidships with one of a second salvo of four Mark 18 torpedoes. At 0704, Natori sank at , taking 330 crewmen including Captain Kubota with her. The destroyers and rescued 194 survivors, and the submarine recovered four more survivors in a rubber raft. On 12 September 1944, almost a month after her sinking, the destroyer captured a lifeboat with another 4 survivors from Natori aboard. Natori was removed from the Navy List on 10 October 1944.

She was active in World War II in various campaigns in Malaya, the Dutch East Indies and New Guinea before being sunk by United States Navy carrier-based aircraft in the Philippines in 1944. Background Following the production of the five s, an additional three 5,500-ton class light cruisers authorized under the 8-4 Fleet Program were ordered by the Imperial Japanese Navy in 1920 as flagships for submarine squadrons. Due to minor changes in design, primarily due to advances in torpedo technology, these three vessels were initially designated as \\"modified Kuma-class\\", or \\"5500-ton class Type II\\", before being re-designated as a separate class named after the lead vessel, . A second set of three vessels was authorized in late 1920.Stille, Imperial Japanese Navy Light Cruisers 1941-45 , page 22-26; Design The Nagara-class vessels were essentially identical to the previous Kuma-class cruisers, retaining the same hull design, engines and main weaponry, with the addition of the new 610 mm Type 93 Long Lance Torpedoes, which required a larger launcher.Gardner, Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1906‚Äì1921; page 238 However, in silhouette, a major difference from the Kuma class was in the configuration of the bridge, which incorporated an aircraft hangar. Initially, a platform was mounted above the No.2 turret, extending over the forward superstructure below the bridge. This was later replaced by an aircraft catapult. Even so, the arrangement proved unwieldy, and the catapult was moved to the rear of each ship in the class, between the No.5 and No.6 turrets during retrofits in 1929-1934. Abukuma and Kinu, were scheduled to receive the new Type 93 torpedoes in early 1941. However, shortages meant that only Abukuma was refitted quadruple mounts in place of the aft twin mounts. Service career =Early career= Kinu was completed on 10 November 1922 at the Kawasaki Shipyard in Kobe. She was briefly commanded by Captain Koshir≈ç Oikawa from December 1923 to January 1924. One year after commissioning, she returned to dry dock for the replacement of all four of her turbine engines, which had failed. The repair work was completed in May 1924. From 1934 to 1935 she was largely used as a training vessel. She was under the command of Captain Shigeyoshi Miwa from November 1935 to December 1936. As the Second Sino- Japanese War began to escalate, she supported landings of Japanese troops in central and southern China, and patrolled the China coast from 1937 to 1938. On 20 November 1941, Kinu was flagship of Rear Admiral Setsuzo Yoshitomi's SubRon 4, based at Iwakuni, Yamaguchi, with SubDiv 18's , , and the , and SubDiv 19's I-56, , and . She was based at Hainan and was engaged in covering landings of Japanese forces in the invasion of British Malaya at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor. CombinedFleet.com: Kinu Tabular Record of Movement =The Hunt for Force Z= On 9 December 1941, reported sighting Force Z (the Royal Navy battleship , battlecruiser and supporting destroyers). The report was received by Kinu, and the 81st Naval Communications Unit in Saigon. The reception was poor and it took another 90 minutes to decode and relay the message to Vice Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa aboard his flagship, . However, I-65s report was incorrect about the heading of Force Z, throwing the Japanese fleet into confusion. A Kawanishi E7K \\"Alf\\" from Kinu buzzed I-65, its pilot mistaking her for an enemy submarine. The following day, Force Z was overwhelmed by torpedo bombers of the 22nd Air Flotilla from French Indochina. =Invasion of Malaya and Dutch East Indies= On 13 December 1941, Kinu departed Cam Ranh Bay, Indochina with Ch≈çkai, and and the destroyers and to provide cover for the invasion landing at Kuantan, Malaya, and from 17‚Äì24 December 1941, to cover landings in Brunei and Miri, Seria, Lutong and Kuching in Sarawak. The 2500 men of the \\"Kawaguchi Detachment\\" and the No. 2 Yokosuka Special Naval Landing Force (SNLF) quickly captured Miri's airfield and oil fields. The operation was completed, and Kinu returned to its base at Cam Ranh Bay, Indochina by the end of the year. From January through March, 1942, Kinu continued to provide coverage for further Japanese landings in Malaya, Sarawak and Java. On 1 March 1942, Kinus convoy was attacked in the Java Sea west of Surabaya by ten obsolete Vickers Vildebeest biplane bombers and 15 fighters of the Australian and New Zealand Air Forces. Kinu was slightly damaged by near- misses and three crewmen were killed by shrapnel. The following day, north of Surabaya, Kinu was attacked by the submarine , which launched four torpedoes, all of which missed. From 10 March 1942, Kinu was assigned to Sentai-16 and was based at Makassar, Celebes and then Ambon. = New Guinea campaigns= From 29 March to 23 April 1942, Kinu was assigned to Rear Admiral Ruitaro Fujita's \\"N\\" Expeditionary Force for the invasion of Dutch New Guinea, which included the seaplane carrier , destroyers and , torpedo boats , , transports and a Naval Landing Force. Afterwards, for most of the month of May, Kinu returned to Kure Naval Arsenal for an overhaul. After returning to the southern front, Kinu was assigned to patrols of the Java Sea from June through September. On 13 September 1942, Kinu embarked the 2nd Infantry Division at Batavia with the light cruiser for the Solomon Islands. It disembarked the troops at Shortland Island and Bougainville on 22 September 1942 and remained on patrol in the Timor Sea and eastern Dutch East Indies through January 1943. On 21 January 1943, Kinu was ordered to proceed to Makassar to assist its sister ship, light cruiser which had been damaged by a single USAAF B-24 Liberator bomber at Amboina harbor on Ambon Island, and escorted the damaged cruiser back to Singapore. Kinu continued to patrol from Makassar through June, with an occasional troop and resupply run to New Guinea. On 23 June 1943, while at Makassar Roads. Kinu and were anchored at Juliana Quay alongside the cruisers and . The cruisers were attacked by 17 B-24 Liberator bombers of the 319th Squadron/90th Bomb Group (H) of the USAAF 5th Air Force. All four were straddled by near-misses, but suffered only slight damage. Kinu was ordered back to Japan for refit and modifications, arriving at Kure Naval Arsenal on 2 August 1943. While at Kure, Kinu‚Äôs No. 5 and No.7 140-mm guns were removed as were her aircraft catapult and derrick. A twin 12.7 cm/40 Type 89 naval gun was fitted as were two triple mount Type 96 25-mm AA guns. This brought Kinu‚Äôs 25-mm anti-aircraft gun total to ten barrels (2x3, 2x2). A Type 21 air search radar was also fitted and depth charge rails were added to her stern. Refit and modifications were completed 14 October 1943, and Kinu immediately departed back for Singapore with troops and supplies. Kinu remained in Singapore, or Malacca or Penang in Malaya or at Batavia in the Dutch East Indies through January 1944. On 23 January 1944, Kinu with accompanied by ≈åi and Kitakami, and escorted by the destroyer made a troop transport run from Singapore to Port Blair, Andaman Islands. On the return voyage to Singapore, Kinu towed Kitakami, which had been damaged by a submarine attack. Kinu remained on patrol in the western Dutch East Indies through April. From April, Kinu starting escorting transport runs from Saipan via Palau to the Celebes and other locations in the Dutch East Indies. On 27 May 1944, the United States began \\"Operation Horlicks\\" to retake Biak. Kinu, Aoba, and destroyers Shikinami, and departed Tarakan to reinforce Biak with 2,300 troops from Zamboanga on Mindanao; however, after being sighted by B-24 bombers and receiving word of the American invasion of Saipan, the operation was canceled and the troops were disembarked at Sorong instead. On 6 June 1944, while anchored off Weigo Island, Vogelkop, New Guinea, Kinu and Aoba were attacked unsuccessfully by B-24 bombers of the Fifth Air Force's 380th Group. Kinu remained on station for a week, and then returned to her patrol area in the western Dutch East Indies through the end of August. =Actions in the Philippines= On 25 September 1944, during Japanese \\"Operation Sho-I-Go\\" to boost the defenses the Philippines, Kinu, Aoba and the destroyer Uranami were assigned to Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita's First Raiding Force. On 11 October 1944 Aoba collided with Kinu in a training accident off Lingga. Both ships were slightly damaged. On 21 October 1944 Sentai-16 was detached from Vice Admiral Kurita's Force to assist the Southwest Area Fleet's transport of 2,500 soldiers of the IJA 41st Regiment from Cagayan, Mindanao to Ormoc, Leyte. The convoy was spotted by the submarine on 23 October 1944. Bream fired six torpedoes at Aoba, one of which hit her No. 2 engine room. Rear Admiral Sakonjo transferred to Kinu, which towed Aoba to the Cavite Navy Yard near Manila for emergency repairs. The following day, as Kinu and Uranami sortied from Cavite for Cagayan, they were attacked by aircraft from Task Group 38.3's aircraft carriers and . Near misses caused light structural damage, but strafing killed 47 crewmen aboard Kinu and 25 crewmen on Uranami. On 25 October 1944, Kinu arrived at Cagayan. The naval transports T.6, T.9 and T.10 each embarked 350 troops and the T.101 and T.102 each loaded 400 men, Kinu embarked 347 men and Uranami 150 men. On 26 October 1944 in the Visayan Sea Kinu and Uranami were attacked by 75-80 aircraft from two groups of Task Group 77.4's escort carriers. TBM Avenger torpedo-bombers from and 12 Avengers and FM-2 Wildcat fighters of VC-21 from made repeated bomb, rocket and strafing hits on Kinu and Uranami. An Avenger from scored two direct bomb hits on Kinu and several rocket hits on Uranami, which sank around noon. At 1130, two more waves of aircraft attacked. A third bomb hit the aft engine room and set Kinu on fire. The Japanese transports rescued most of Kinus crew of 813 men, including Captain Harumi Kawasaki. Rear Admiral Sakonjo transferred his flag to the transport T.10 and made Manila the next day. At 1730, Kinu sank by the stern in of water southwest of Masbate, Philippine Islands. Kinu was removed from the navy list on 20 December 1944. On 15 July 1945 divers from explored the sunken Kinu, finding the wreck flat on the bottom with a 90 degree list to port, with her back broken in the well deck area behind the bridge, which was largely undamaged. Divers recovered classified documents and four coding machines.

He was appointed manager of Walton & Hersham in 1967 and led them to the Athenian League title in 1969 and the Amateur Cup in 1973. Batsford first tasted glory in the FA Cup when Walton held Brian Clough's Brighton to a draw before beating them 4-0 in the replay. Before the game, Clough had described the pairing as \\"donkeys against thoroughbreds\\", but the result from Batsford's team spoke for itself. In 1974, he left to join Wimbledon, then a semi- professional club in the Southern League. He led them to three consecutive league titles and ultimately election to the Football League in 1977. Most famously, he steered Wimbledon to the fourth round of the FA Cup in 1975, having beaten Burnley in the third round, at that time one of the strongest clubs in Britain. It was the first victory by a non-League club at the ground of a First Division team for 54 years. In the fourth round, they travelled to Elland Road and held the mighty Leeds United, then League Champions, to a heroic goal-less draw before narrowly losing the replay 0-1 due to a deflected own goal from Dave Bassett. Only six months after achieving Football League status, Batsford resigned from Wimbledon following disagreements with the club chairman, Ron Noades, and he was succeeded by Dario Gradi. Batsford then returned to managing in non-league football, first with a short stint at Hillingdon Borough FC before thriving once more with Wealdstone FC, whose squad included the future England international Stuart Pearce. In 1981-82, Batsford led Wealdstone to success in both the Southern League's championship, which secured promotion to the Alliance Premier League (the equivalent of the current Conference Premier) and its challenge cup, then to third place in their first season in the Alliance. In the 1984-85 season, the club, now under the management of Batsford's assistant and former Wimbledon coach Brian Hall, became the first in history to achieve the non-league double of being Alliance Premier League champions and FA Trophy winners. Batsford suffered heart trouble and decided to leave Wealdstone, but he recovered sufficiently to coach at Queen's Park Rangers, then serve as general manager of Dulwich Hamlet before running the Millwall youth team again and also acting as a talent scout for Dave Bassett during his former prot√©g√©'s managerial stints with Watford, Sheffield United and Nottingham Forest. In 2004-05 he held the honorary position of President of his first club, Walton & Hersham.

More commonly, at the end of a broadcast, a programme will say: \\"Thank you, New Zealand on Air, for helping us make (name of the show).\\" The agency funds Radio New Zealand, and the independently-owned Access Radio Network, Student Radio Network and Pacific Media Network. = Cultural promotion = NZ on Air focuses on \\"local content\\" ‚Äì New Zealand programmes that are expensive or risky to make which the broadcaster market cannot fully pay for. These programmes are primarily drama, documentary, children's programmes and special-interest programmes. = Archiving = Funding for audiovisual archiving is now administered directly by the Ministry for Culture and Heritage. Centralising such archiving funding was a key recommendation of the seminal Horrocks review led by NZ on Air and published in 2009. In 2008 NZOA funded the establishment of NZ on Screen to enable easy online access for past New Zealand screen production. NZOA has since funded a similar NZ music history site Audio Culture, which launched in 2013. = Promotion of New Zealand music = Aimed at increasing the diversity of New Zealand music on diverse platforms including radio.  Broadcasting fee  NZOA was established under the Broadcasting Act 1989, initially funded by an annual 110 licence fee known as the Public Broadcasting Fee, paid by each household with a television set. A strong campaign developed in the late 1990s from a section of the public against the Broadcasting Fee. The reason behind the campaign was to prove \\"whether the broadcasting fee is a tax and the legality of applying GST to this tax\\". In the end the fee was scrapped in 1999, and the Commission has since been directly funded by the government. The fee was collected from those people who owned a television set although the fee was funding much more than television work, especially radio. Some campaigners believed this was unfair.  Music production  NZ on Air produces and distributes the Kiwi Hit Disc to showcase new funded music. NZOA provides \\"Making Tracks\\" funding for recording songs and their associated music videos. Funded music is chosen by a monthly, rotating panel of broadcast and music professionals.  Controversies and criticism  NZ on Air has attracted criticism over claims of misuse of its funds. In mid-2010 it spent $75,000 on two events celebrate 21 years of activity and between 2006 and 2011 it gave $80,000 in funding to help produce recordings and music videos for Annabel Fay, daughter of one of New Zealand's richest men, Sir Michael Fay. The Fay controversy contributed to the scrapping of the NZ on Air Album funding scheme in December 2010. NZ on Air was also criticised in 2012 for helping fund the production of The GC, a TV3 documentary series about young MƒÅori New Zealanders living on Australia's Gold Coast and for granting $30,000 to assist recording by Titanium, the winner of a radio competition to create a boy band. In early 2012, Labour MPs accused NZ on Air of a potential conflict of interest when NZ on Air board member and Prime Minister John Key's electorate chairman Stephen McElrea questioned the timing of the NZ on Air-funded documentary Inside Child Poverty, broadcast four days before the 2011 New Zealand general election. Two days after the broadcast, NZ on Air CEO Jane Wrightson had written to broadcaster TV3, expressing her disappointment with the show being broadcast days before the election. Complaints were laid with the Electoral Commission, which found the documentary did not come under its jurisdiction so it could not rule. The Broadcasting Standards Authority also received a complaint, but found the documentary did not break its rules on fairness, and law and order.

At 22:43 on May 24, 2001, during the wedding of Keren and Asaf Dror, a large portion of the third floor of the three-story building collapsed. As a result, 23 people fell to their deaths through two stories, including the groom's 80-year-old grandfather and his three-year-old second cousin, the youngest victim. Another 380 were injured, including the bride who suffered serious pelvic injuries that required surgery. Asaf, who escaped serious injury, carried her in his arms from the rubble. The disaster shocked the Israeli public not only because it was one of the worst building disasters in the country's history, but because the event was documented on a camcorder and broadcast on local and international television.  Rescue efforts  Rescue efforts were carried out by the Home Front Command's Search & Rescue Unit and the Yachtza reserve unit. Rescue efforts commenced immediately after the collapse and continued until 4pm on Saturday May 26, 2001. Three people were pulled from the rubble alive, and 23 bodies were removed.  Investigation  An investigation of the event concluded that the event was not caused by a terrorist attack. (The disaster occurred during the second intifada.) This was based on the testimony provided by many of the wedding guests present in the building during the disaster. Witnesses reported seeing a dangerous sag in the floor moments before the collapse. An initial inquiry blamed the collapse on the Pal-Kal (he) method of constructing light-weight coffered concrete floor systems which was banned shortly after the completion of the wedding hall since it was known and proven to be unsafe. Further review pointed to a combination of two alternative causes. Initially, the side of the building that failed was designed to be a two-story structure, while the other side was designed to be three stories. Late in the construction process, it was decided that both sides of the building should be equal heights, and a third story was added to the shorter side. However, the live load due to occupancy is typically much greater than the design load for a roof. As a result, the structure supporting the new third story was subjected to much greater loading than was originally anticipated. The effect of this error was somewhat mitigated by the construction of partitions on the floor below, which helped redistribute the excess load well such that no damage was incurred. A few weeks before the collapse, the wedding hall owners decided to remove the partitions. With the load path eliminated, the floor above began to sag several centimetres. The owners viewed the sagging floor primarily as a cosmetic problem, and attempted to level it with additional grout and fill. However, their approach not only failed to provide additional structural capacity, it also inadvertently introduced a new and significant dead load at the weakened area. During the wedding event in 2001, this significantly overstressed floor section failed, resulting in the catastrophe. The engineer Eli Ron, inventor of the Pal-Kal method of construction, was arrested and subsequently indicted in August 2002 on the charge of manslaughter. Ron had not engaged in any part of the design or construction, but had sold proprietary elements necessary for construction that were installed in a deficient manner. Versailles law Following the disaster, the \\"Versailles Law\\" was passed by the Parliament of Israel. This law established a special committee responsible for treating the people injured in the disaster. Moreover, an official investigation committee was established by the then Prime Minister Ariel Sharon under the leadership of the former judge Vardimos Zeiler (he), who was in charge of the security of public places and buildings. The Zeiler Committee on Building Safety investigated both the Versailles wedding hall collapse as well as the Maccabiah bridge collapse which occurred four years earlier in 1997, and released its final report in December 2003. In October 2004, the three owners of Versailles wedding hall ‚Äî Avraham Adi, Uri Nisim, and Efraim Adiv ‚Äì were convicted of causing death by negligence and causing damage by negligence. Adi and Adiv were sentenced to 30 months' imprisonment while Nisim was sentenced to four months of community service. The wedding hall was subsequently demolished, and as of 2017 the site remained unoccupied and sealed. Across the street from the site is a memorial garden with names of victims inscribed on a wall. In May 2007, Eli Ron and three engineers involved in the building's construction were sentenced to prison by the Jerusalem District Court. Eli Ron received a four-year sentence, Shimon Kaufman and Dan Sheffer 22 months, and Uri Pessah six months. In December 2006, the court convicted all three men of causing death by negligence and sabotage by negligence.  In popular culture  The Pal-Kal issue was mentioned in \\"Point of Origin\\" season 1, episode 5, of the show 9-1-1, where there is an arranged marriage and the floor falls apart due to what is referred to as Kal-Pal.  Memorial  A memorial garden to the victims was built near the disaster site. ◊ê◊°◊ï◊ü ◊ï◊®◊°◊ê◊ô - 1.jpg ◊ê◊†◊ì◊®◊ò◊™ ◊ê◊°◊ï◊ü ◊ê◊ï◊ú◊û◊ô ◊ï◊®◊°◊ê◊ô - ◊ô◊®◊ï◊©◊ú◊ô◊ù.jpg ◊ê◊°◊ï◊ü ◊ï◊®◊°◊ê◊ô - 4.jpg ◊ê◊°◊ï◊ü ◊ï◊®◊°◊ê◊ô - 3.jpg ◊ê◊°◊ï◊ü ◊ï◊®◊°◊ê◊ô - 2.jpg  See also  * Structural failure * Hyatt Regency walkway collapse, a similar incident that occurred 20 years prior that was due to insufficient load capacity as a result of negligent design flaws.

It is operated as part of the Seattle Public Schools system and serves the Beacon Hill and Georgetown neighborhoods. The school was established in 1927 and named for President Grover Cleveland, and its building is a designated city landmark. History The then-independent city of Georgetown established a high school in 1903, with one class graduating from the facility at the Mueller School annex. Beginning in 1905, Georgetown and south Seattle students were moved to high schools across the city, including West Seattle, Queen Anne, Broadway and Franklin. The Seattle Public Schools board approved construction of a new high school in the south end of Seattle in 1925, after petitioning from residents. The new school, which was named for President Grover Cleveland in accordance with naming schools after famous Americans, opened on January 3, 1927, and graduated its first class in the spring. Cleveland High School also initially hosted a middle school, named Grover Cleveland Junior High School, that was moved to Asa Mercer Junior High School in 1957. The school was expanded with a new north wing in 1958, featuring a new metal shop classroom, and facilities for art, band and choir, paid for by a citywide bond issue approved in 1955. A new $1.25 million gymnasium and administrative offices were dedicated by Mayor Wes Uhlman and Lieutenant Governor John Cherberg in 1970. Cleveland, the smallest of the city's high schools with a capacity of 729 students, was slated for conversion into a middle school by the school board in 1979. Under the plan, high school students would be moved to the Asa Mercer Junior High School several blocks to the north, saving $4 million in potential renovation costs for the school district. Students and faculty were strongly opposed to the closure plan, and it was ultimately modified to keep Cleveland open as a high school. After the approval of a citywide levy for school improvements in 2001, Cleveland High School underwent a $68 million, two-year renovation in 2006. The project was completed in September 2007, after complications arising from asbestos found in ceilings and unexpected geological hazards below the school building. Earlier concepts for the renovation included sharing the building with a community college, as well as splitting the high school into four autonomous schools. Architecture Cleveland High School is still housed in its original 1927 building, designed in the 20th century Neo- Georgian style by Floyd Naramore, who would later become a founding member of NBBJ. The three-story school building has a brick facade with a terra cotta trim. The center of the building features a two-story bay with a balcony and Corinthian columns. The high school, located atop southwestern Beacon Hill, overlooks Georgetown, the Duwamish River valley, Boeing Field, and Interstate 5. Demographics The surrounding neighborhood on Beacon Hill is now primarily Asian, and most of the school's students are Asian. Programs In 1993, Cleveland became the home to the Fish and Roses project. Fish and Roses integrated fish farming and hydroponics into the school's curriculum. Mark Weber, the project originator, and Ted Howard, Sr., the principal wanted to see the project used as the focus of a new math and science based school. A separate building was built with funding from Boeing and Costco to house the project but within a few years the building was razed to make room for the new gym and school remodel. In 2003, under a Gates Foundation grant, the district separated Cleveland into four small academies - the Infotech Academy, which had started up in a small way in 2000 before the grant; the Arts and Humanities Academy; the Health, Environment and Life Academy (HEAL); and the Global Studies Academy. By 2009 Cleveland retained the Global Studies and HEAL academies, but overall academic improvement remained elusive. 56.7% of students graduated in 2009, on time or otherwise. In 2008, Cleveland was one of two high schools included in the Southeast Initiative, a plan to increase expenditures for three years at schools that parents had fled under the school choice plan. The Seattle Times School Guide reported that Cleveland's 2008 on- time graduation rate had been 44%. Cleveland's enrollment remained low at 695 students in 2008-2009, 94% of them from minority ethnic groups. Few of Cleveland's students chose it as their first choice. Starting in fall 2010, Cleveland will become a citywide Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) high school, divided into a Life Sciences and Global Health academy and an Engineering and Computer Science academy. Only 21% of Cleveland's 10th graders passed the WASL math test in 2009 and 16% passed the science test, up from 12% and 6.9% in 2008. Cleveland's 2010-2011 11th and 12th graders will not be accepted into STEM, but will continue to attend Cleveland in a general studies program until the transition is complete. The school's 2009-2010 9th graders will be enrolled in STEM as 10th graders. A new incoming 9th grade class from throughout the city will be the model for all future STEM cohorts. Future high schoolers from Cleveland's own neighborhood, if they do not enroll in STEM, will be sent to nearby high schools. STEM enrollment at Cleveland is open to any student who will be in the 9th or 10th grade in fall 2010, with no prerequisites. Cleveland's school day will be half an hour longer than in other Seattle high schools. By the time school opened in September 2010, the name of the engineering academy became the School of Engineering and Design. Computer Science was not dropped but is an elective course open to students in 9-12. Juniors and seniors will be allowed to take freshman and sophomore STEM courses if they wish.

The story concerns Winnie, whose best friend Iggie has moved away. The new family moving into Iggie's house are the first black people in the neighborhood. While Winnie is quick to make friends with the new kids, she realizes that some people, possibly including her own parents, have trouble seeing past a person's color. Plot summary Winnie Barringer is heartbroken over her close friend Iggie's move to Tokyo, Japan. However, she immediately takes an interest in the black family that has relocated in Iggie's old house, the Garbers, who have moved to her neighborhood (in an unspecified location) from Detroit, and prioritizes befriending the family's three children, Glenn, Herbie, and Tina, over all else. Her first meeting with the Garber children is awkward and nearly disastrous as she brings up racist subjects inadvertently, but she tries to overcome this by continuing to bond with them, despite several major bumps in the road along the way ‚Äî most notably her snobby, prejudiced neighbor Mrs. Landon's callous attempts at running the Garbers out of town because of their race. After Mrs. Landon and her daughter Clarice leave a sign on the Garbers' lawn telling them they are unwanted and to leave town, Winnie fears that the Garbers will move again, and becomes extremely disappointed in her parents (especially her mother, who appears to demonstrate racism equal to Mrs. Landon's, albeit in more subtle ways) for not standing up for the Garbers. Eventually Mrs. Landon decides to sell her house and move away herself for no reason other than her prejudice, and attempts to pressure her neighbors into doing the same. This proves to be the last straw for Winnie's father, who thoroughly excoriates Mrs. Landon for her intolerance and tells her there will be no blockbusting in their neighborhood. Although she is proud of her father for telling Mrs. Landon off, Winnie fears that her parents will follow Mrs. Landon's lead, and decides to stow away on a ship to Japan to live with Iggie's family as she would be ashamed of having racist parents. In the end, Winnie's parents decide not to move but only, Winnie's mother tells her, because \\"moving is too much trouble,\\" not because they wish to befriend the Garbers. Winnie is again disappointed by her mother's attitudes but is glad to see her father is being more receptive to the idea of being a good neighbor to the Garbers. She also realizes that she herself has a long way to go, and decides to work on becoming a real friend to the Garbers.

Chem. Eur. J. 2001, vol. 7, pp. 3657-3670 It is commonly referred to as gold(III) bromide, gold tribromide, and rarely but traditionally auric bromide, and sometimes as digold hexabromide. As is similar with the other gold halides, this compound is unique for being a coordination complex of a group 11 transition metal that is stable in an oxidation state of three whereas copper or silver complexes persist in oxidation states of one or two.Schwerdtfeger, P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989, vol. 111, pp. 7261-7262 History The first mention of any research or study of the gold halides dates back to the early-to-mid-19th century, and there are three primary researchers associated with the extensive investigation of this particular area of chemistry: Thomsen, Schottl√§nder, and Kr√ºss.Lengefield, F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1901, vol. 26, pp. 324Thomsen, J. J. prakt. Chem. 1876, vol. 13, pp. 337 Schottl√§nder, Justus Liebigs Ann. Chem., vol. 217, pp. 312Kr√ºss, G. Ber. Dtsch. Chem. Ges. 1887, vol. 20, pp. 2634 Structure The dimer, digold hexabromide, has structural properties similar to those of the other gold trihalide dimeric compounds, such as gold(III) chloride. The gold centers exhibit square planar coordination with bond angles of roughly 90 degrees. Calculations indicate that in the hypothetical monomeric forms of the gold trihalides, the Jahn-Teller effect causes differences to arise in the structures of the gold halide complexes. For instance, gold(III) bromide contains one long and two short gold-bromine bonds whereas gold(III) chloride and gold(III) fluoride consist of two long and one short gold-halogen bonds. Moreover, gold tribromide does not exhibit the same coordination around the central gold atom as gold trichloride or gold trifluoride. In the latter complexes, the coordination exhibits a T-conformation, but in gold tribromide the coordination exists as more of a dynamic balance between a Y-conformation and a T-conformation. This coordination difference can be attributed to the Jahn-Teller effect but more so to the decrease in œÄ-back bonding of the gold atoms with the bromine ligands compared to the œÄ-back bonding found with fluorine and chlorine ligands. It is also this decrease in œÄ-back bonding which explains why gold tribromide is less stable than its trifluoride and trichloride counterparts. :350px Preparation The most common synthesis method of gold(III) bromide is heating gold and excess liquid bromine at 140 ¬∞C: :2 Au + 3 Br2 ‚Üí Au2Br6 Alternatively, the halide-exchange reaction of gold(III) chloride with hydrobromic acid has also been proven successful in synthesizing gold(III) bromide: :Au2Cl6 \\\\+ 6 HBr ‚Üí 6 HCl + Au2Br6 This reaction is driven by the production of the relatively more stable hydrochloric acid compared with hydrobromic acid. Dell'Amico, D.B.; Calderazzo, F.; Morvillo, A.; Pelizzi, G; Robino, P. J. Chem. Soc., Dalton Trans. 1991, pp. 3009-3016 Chemical properties The neutral monomer AuBr3, as well as the other neutral gold trihalide species, has not been isolated in the gas phase which indicates the coordination number three is not favored.Schwerdtfeger, P.; Boyd, P.D.W.; Brienne, S.; Burrell, K. Inorg. Chem. 1992, vol. 31, pp. 3411-3422 Predominantly, gold(III) displays square planar coordination corresponding to a preferred coordination number of four. Specifically, in solution gold(III) trihalides have the tendency to add a fourth ligand to form the more preferred four-coordinate complex. With respect to gold tribromide, it is common to purchase gold(III) bromide hydrate, AuBr3‚ãÖH2O, where the central gold atom exhibits a coordination number of four, rather than the anhydrous form of the compound, which exhibits a coordination number of three. Alternatively, if there is no addition of a fourth ligand, gold tribromide will oligomerize to form the halogen-bridged dimer complex mentioned previously. :2 AuBr3 ‚Üí Au2Br6 Furthermore, like gold(III) chloride, gold tribromide is a Lewis acid and can form several complexes. For example, in the presence of hydrobromic acid, the dimer dissolves and bromoauric acid is formed. :HBr (aq) + AuBr3 (aq) ‚Üí H+AuBr4‚àí (aq) The dimer also undergoes hydrolysis rapidly in moist air. Uses =Catalytic chemistry= Gold(III) bromide is used as a catalyst in a variety of reactions, but one of its most interesting uses is found in the Diels-Alder reaction. Specifically, the compound catalyzes the reaction between an enynal unit and carbonyl compounds to form a six-membered cyclic compound.Asao, N.; Aikawa, H.; Yamamoto, Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004, vol. 126, pp. 7458-7459 :400px Another catalytic use of gold tribromide is in the nucleophilic substitution reaction of propargylic alcohols. In this reaction, the gold complex acts as an alcohol-activating agent to facilitate the substitution.Georgy, M.; Boucard, V.; Campagne, J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005, vol. 127, pp. 14180-14181 :400px =Ketamine Detection= Gold(III) bromide can be used as a testing reagent for the presence of ketamine. 0.25% AuBr3 0.1M NaOH is prepared to give a brownish-yellow solution. Two drops of this are added to a spotting plate and a small amount of ketamine is added. The mixture gives a deep purple color within approximately one minute, which turns to a dark, blackish-purple color within approximately two minutes. Acetaminophen, ascorbic acid, heroin, lactose, mannitol, morphine, and sucrose all cause an instant colour change to purple, as do other compounds with phenol and hydroxyl groups. Nothing commonly found in conjunction with ketamine gave the same colour change in the same time. \\"The initial purple color may be due to the formation of a complex between the gold and the ketamine. The cause for the change of color from purple to dark blackish- purple is unknown; however, it may be due to a redox reaction that produces a small amount of colloidal gold.\\" References Bromides Metal halides Gold(III) compounds Drug testing reagents Gold‚Äìhalogen compounds ","title":"Gold(III) bromide"},{"id":"5024112","text":"Peritus (Latin for \\"expert\\") is the title given to Roman Catholic theologians attending an ecumenical council to give advice.

Joseph Ratzinger who became Pope Benedict XVI served as peritus to Cardinal Josef Frings, Archbishop of Cologne, Germany, while Hans K√ºng was a peritus for the Second Vatican Council, rather than for an individual bishop.

Cardinal Yves Congar served as a consultant to the council upon the invitation of Pope John XXIII, but was hired as personal and expert theologian (peritus) at the council to Bishop Jean-Julien Weber of Strasbourg which allowed him to attend all the general sessions and to participate in discussions of any commission to which he was invited to. The periti of Vatican II, although their official status designates them as at the service of the council, were most often first of all at the service of the currents which clashed at the council, either on the side of a reform of the church (acceptance of religious freedom, revision of church‚Äìstate relations, reassessment of relations with other religions), either on the side of the continuation of a clash of Catholicism with the other institutions and currents of society, in the wake of the councils of Trent and Vatican I (especially for the experts close to Coetus Internationalis Patrum).

She was named after the Abukuma River in the T≈çhoku region of Japan. She saw action during World War II in the Attack on Pearl Harbor and in the Pacific, before being disabled in the Battle of Surigao Strait in October 1944, then bombed and sunk by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) off the coast of the Philippines. Background Following the production of the five s, an additional three 5,500-ton class light cruisers authorized under the 8-4 Fleet Program were ordered by the Imperial Japanese Navy in 1920. Due to minor changes in design, primarily due to advances in torpedo technology, these three vessels were initially designated as ‚Äúmodified Kuma-class‚Äù, or ‚Äú5500-ton class Type II‚Äù, before being re-designated as a separate class named after the lead vessel, . A second set of three vessels was authorized in late 1920.Stille, Imperial Japanese Navy Light Cruisers 1941-45 , page 22-26; Design The Nagara-class vessels were essentially identical to the previous Kuma-class cruisers, retaining the same hull design, engines and main weaponry, with the addition of the new 610 mm Type 93 Long Lance Torpedoes, which required a larger launcher.Gardner, Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1906‚Äì1921; page 238 However, in silhouette, a major difference from the Kuma class was in the configuration of the bridge, which incorporated an aircraft hangar. Initially, a 33-foot platform was mounted above the No.2 turret, extending over the forward superstructure below the bridge. This was later replaced by an aircraft catapult. Even so, the arrangement proved unwieldy, and the catapult was moved to the rear of each ship in the class, between the No.5 and No.6 turrets during retrofits in 1929-1934. Abukuma and , were scheduled to receive the new Type 93 torpedoes in early 1941. However, shortages meant that only Abukuma was refitted quadruple mounts in place of the aft twin mounts between March and May 1941, and her forward twin mounts were removed. Abukuma carried sixteen Type 93 torpedoes, including eight reloads. Abukuma was also the first vessel in her class to receive radar (in 1943) . Construction and career =Early career= Abukuma was laid down on 8 December 1921, launched on 16 March 1923 and completed at the Uraga Dock Company on 26 May 1925, her commissioning having been delayed due to the Great Kant≈ç earthquake. From November 1927 to December 1928, she was under the command of Captain Teijir≈ç Toyoda. On 20 October 1930, during large-scale fleet maneuvers, Abukuma rammed the cruiser between her No.2 and No.3 funnels. The collision only lightly damaged Kitakami, but Abukuma lost her bow and had to be towed by the battleship to Tateyama, Chiba, and from there she was returned to Yokosuka Naval Arsenal by tugboats. Repairs with a temporary bow were completed by 22 November 1930, but a permanent bow with a slightly different design was refitted at Kure Naval Arsenal from 1 April to 30 December 1931. CombinedFleet.com: Abukuma Tabular Record of Movement From December 1931 to November 1932, she was under the command of Captain Seiichi Iwamura. In 1932, Abukuma was assigned to the Japanese Third Fleet and assigned to patrols off the coast of northern China after the Manchurian Incident. As the situation with China continued to deteriorate, Abukuma was assigned to provide coverage for Japanese transports during the Battle of Shanghai, and remained on station patrolling the China coast and the Yangtze River through 1938. Her anti- aircraft weaponry was upgraded in 1933 and 1936, and her torpedo launchers in 1938. From November 1934 to November 1935, she was under the command of Captain Takeo Kurita. =Early stages of the Pacific War= Abukuma set sail from Hitokappu Bay on Etorofu in the Kurile Islands on 26 November 1941 with Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo's Carrier Striking Force. She served as the flagship of Rear Admiral Sentar≈ç ≈åmori's Destroyer Squadron 1 (\\"DesRon1\\"), consisting of the destroyers , , , , , , , and . DesRon1 served as the anti- submarine escort for the six aircraft carriers (,, , , , ), two battleships ( and ) and two heavy cruisers ( and ) that carried the offensive power of the Carrier Striking Force. Nearly 360 aircraft were launched against Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, inflicting heavy damage: sinking four American battleships, damaging three others, destroying more than 100 aircraft. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Abukuma led DesRon1 with most of the Carrier Striking Force on the return to Japan, and received a hero's welcome on 23 December 1941.Dull, A Battle History Imperial Japanese Navy =Actions in the South Pacific= In January 1942, DesRon1 escorted the Japanese invasion fleet for the invasion of Rabaul, New Britain and Kavieng, New Ireland from its forward base at Truk in the Caroline Islands. In early February, DesRon1 accompanied the Carrier Striking Force in an unsuccessful pursuit of Vice Admiral William F. Halsey Jr's Task Force 8, after the aircraft carrier raided Kwajalein and Wotje in the Marshall Islands. Abukuma was then ordered to Palau, from which it accompanied the Carrier Striking Force on the attack on Port Darwin, Australia. At the end of February and into April, DesRon1 escorted the Carrier Striking Force in attacks on Java in the Dutch East Indies, and Colombo and Trincomalee in Ceylon and against other targets in the Indian Ocean, including the Royal Navy aircraft carrier as part of the Indian Ocean raids. The fleet returned to Singapore on 11 April 1942. =Battle of the Aleutian Islands= In May, Abukuma and its destroyer squadron were reassigned to the Northern Force under Vice Admiral Boshir≈ç Hosogaya, and escorted the light aircraft carriers and , supporting the invasion of Attu and Kiska in the Battle of the Aleutian Islands. In June and July, DesRon1 returned to Japan to escort a convoy of reinforcements to the two freshly captured islands in the Aleutians. After uneventful patrolling in the Aleutian Islands and Kurile Islands, DesRon1 escorted three more reinforcement and supply convoys to the Aleutians in October, November and December. Abukuma returned to Sasebo Naval Arsenal for refit on 12 December 1942, during which time two triple-mount Type 96 25 mm AA guns were installed, and the No. 5 14 cm/50 3rd Year Type naval gun and the quad 13.2 mm machine gun mount in front of the bridge were replaced by a twin 13.2 mm machine gun mount. After refit, Abukuma returned to northern waters to continue reinforcement operations to Attu and Kiska in January, February and March 1943. Abukuma participated in the Battle of the Komandorski Islands on 26 March 1943, during which time she fired 95 rounds from her 140mm guns and four torpedoes. Abukuma was undamaged during the battle, but the heavy cruiser was badly damaged and the Japanese Fifth Fleet was forced to abort its supply mission to the Aleutians. The fleet commander, Vice Admiral Hosogaya, disgraced because he had been forced to withdraw by the weaker American fleet, was forced to retire. From April through May 1943, Abukuma underwent refit at the Maizuru Naval Arsenal, during which time a Type 21 air-search radar was installed, and it was thus not present during \\"Operation Landcrab\\", during which American forces recaptured Attu. In July, Abukuma and DesRon1 provided support for the evacuation of Kiska. On 26 July 1943, the kaibokan collided with Abukuma, hitting her starboard quarter, but causing little damage. On 12 September 1943, while cruising off Paramushiro, Abukuma suffered slight damage by near misses by bombs from USAAF B-24 Liberator and B-25 Mitchell aircraft. In dry dock once again at Yokosuka from October through November 1943, Abukumas No. 7 gun mount was removed, and a twin mount of 40 caliber Type 89 127 mm HA guns (unshielded) was fitted, as was a triple-mount Type 96 25 mm AA gun and four single-mount 25 mm AA guns. After refit, Abukuma returned to northern waters in December for antisubmarine patrol off Hokkaid≈ç and the Kurile Islands to June. On 21 June 1944, during yet another refit at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal, a Type 22 surface-search radar was fitted, together with ten more single-mount Type 96 25 mm AA guns. Five single-mount Type 93 13.2 mm machine guns were also added. Work was completed by 13 July 1944, after which Abukuma had a total of thirty 25-mm and ten 13-mm AA guns. =Battle of Surigao Strait= Abukuma remained in Japanese home waters through the middle of October 1944, when she was reassigned to sortie with its seven destroyers against the U.S. fleet off Taiwan in October 1944. However, she was re-directed from Mako in the Pescadores to Manila to support Vice Admiral Shoji Nishimura against the U.S. Navy in the Philippines. Abukuma was joined by the heavy cruisers Nachi, and seven destroyers in a flotilla commanded by Vice Admiral Kiyohide Shima. During 15‚Äì22 October, this flotilla was spotted by six different American submarines, but only one was able to maneuver close enough to fire torpedoes: . The flotilla was cruising at and zigzagging through the Luzon Strait on 22 October. Seadragon fired four torpedoes through her stern tubes, but all missed. All six submarines reported the flotilla's course, position and speed to American fleet units approaching the area. Abukuma met her fate at the Battle of Surigao Strait, part of the overall campaign of four naval battles collectively referred to as the Battle of Leyte Gulf. In the pre-dawn hours of 25 October 1944, as Shima's force entered the strait, the flotilla was attacked by a squadron of American PT boats. Lieutenant (jg) Mike Kovar's PT-137 fired a torpedo at a destroyer, but it ran deep and passed beneath the target to strike Abukuma at 0325 near the No. 1 boiler room, killing 37 crewmen. Abukuma was disabled and fell behind the rest of the flotilla, but after emergency repairs, was able to get under way and by 0445, she was making . By 0535, Abukuma had caught up to the rest of the flotilla. However, she was down at the bow and shipping at least 500 tons of seawater; at 0830 she was ordered to Dapitan for repairs, escorted by the destroyer . On 26 October, Abukuma and Ushio departed Dapitan for Coron, Palawan but was spotted and attacked repeatedly by B-24 Liberator bombers of the 5th Group, 13th Air Force armed with bombs. At 1006 she took a direct hit near the No. 3 140 mm turret; at 1020 two more hits by B-24 bombers of the 33rd Squadron 22nd Group, 5th Air Force were scored further aft that started fires. The fire spread to the engine rooms and aft torpedo rooms. Power was lost and the ship's speed decreased. At 1037, four Type 93 \\"Long Lance\\" torpedoes in the aft torpedo room exploded with devastating effect. The crew abandoned ship between 1200 and 1230 off Negros Island, . At 1242, she sank by the stern at with 250 of her crew. Ushio rescued her captain and 283 crewmen. Abukuma was removed from the Navy List on 20 December 1944.

As an \\"NPR & Classical Music\\" station, it broadcasts NPR news, local and syndicated classical music shows (switching to jazz music on weekends), and other public radio programming. The station is owned by Clover Park Technical College in Lakewood, but since 2010, has been operated by the Edward R. Murrow College of Communication at Washington State University. It is one of three NPR member stations in the Seattle/Tacoma area, with fellow Tacoma-based station KNKX and Seattle-based KUOW-FM being the other two stations. History The station began in 1955 as KCPS and also had the call letters KPEC-FM from 1972 until 1983. During this time instructors Bill Doane and Bob Piatt brought many radio professionals to speak to their classes and radio veteran Bill Glass claims this was a sound foundation for his career. From March 1988 until June 2010 KVTI was known as i-91fm and featured Top 40 music (with news in the morning and afternoon), Tuesday nights featured live acoustic music from 7-10PM and Talk and Public Affairs from 10PM to Midnight. In 2006 and 2007, KVTI was recognized as the Top 40 Radio Station of the year by the New Music Awards. In the same ceremonies, music director Beth Valiant was recognized as Top 40 Music Director of the year. In 2008, program director John Mangan was recognized as New Music Weekly's Top 40 Program Director of the Year and music director Beth Valiant won Top 40 Music Director of the Year for the 5th consecutive year. On April 7, 2010, CPTC announced that it would outsource KVTI's operations to Northwest Public Radio effective June 1, 2010. Washington State University had been looking for some time to enter the Seattle market, even though it would be going head-to-head with two of the highest-rated NPR stations in the country, KUOW-FM and KPLU- FM. However, KVTI's signal is not nearly as strong as its main competitors. While it decently covers Tacoma and Olympia, it only provides grade B coverage of Seattle. It can't be heard at all in major portions of Snohomish County because it is short-spaced to KSER in Everett at 90.7. Fifty-five years of programming and operation by Clover Park students and staff ended at the close of the broadcast day June 16, 2010.

It's the second book in the Fudge Series. Plot summary The book centers on Sheila Tubman, a 10-year-old girl who masks her insecurities with a much more self-assured, confident persona. In truth, she suffers from fears ranging from arachnophobia (fear of spiders and other arachnids), cynophobia (fear of dogs), and aquaphobia (fear of water). Her family decides to spend the summertime in Tarrytown, New York, where she is enrolled at a day camp and meets Merle \\"Mouse\\" Ellis, an easygoing, courageous, and slightly tomboyish girl skilled with her unlimited knowledge of yo-yo tricks. To Sheila's dismay, the family that owns the house in which they are staying owns a dog named Jennifer that she deeply fears and avoids, and her troubles increase when they learn of Jennifer's pregnancy and the desires of Sheila's sister Libby to adopt one of the puppies. Aside from these factors, Sheila is enlisted in swimming lessons (to her chagrin, but finally manages to take the final exam and earned a beginner's certificate) and single-handedly starts a camp newspaper (which proves a lot of work, but hands over editorship to two bigger boys who completed a crossword puzzle of hers; having promised a prize but forgotten to name it), even painting the backdrop of the camp's production of Peter Pan (Sheila accomplishes this without incident; and even laughs to herself that Libby is cast as Captain Hook, to Libby's consternation). Sheila believes that her fearless masquerade is effective, but her beliefs are proven false after the guests at her sleepover party write otherwise in a slam book activity. Despite the brawl that ensues between the agitated girls, devastated by the insults written in each other's books, their friendship, nevertheless, continues, and Sheila slowly overcomes her fears (albeit not entirely) little by little. As the summer draws to a close with a barbecue party, she is unshaken at the thought of her family's adoption of a puppy, and realizes that she enjoyed her vacation after all. Sheila series Sheila is also a character in the Fudge series. Other than brief anecdotes, Peter and his dog, Turtle, are the only members of the Hatcher family to appear in the book. They appear in the first chapter, and are mentioned by Sheila several times in the story. She also briefly mentions Peter's brother, Fudge, though not by name.  Major Characters Sheila Tubman-the main protagonist who's excited about being in Tarrytown for the summer, but has many fears, and has a hard time admitting those fears to people Libby Tubman- Sheila's thirteen year old sister, who's a ballerina and is boy crazy Merle (a.k.a Mouse) Ellis- Sheila's friend in Tarrytown, who is the junior champion of yo-yoing. She's a champion swimmer, and a dog lover. One chapter deals with her sneaking into her own house through a dumbwaiter so the girls can play hide and seek when bad weather precluded them from doing it outdoors. Sondra and Jane Van Arden- The Van Arden twins, who are good friends with Sheila and Mouse. They both are very excellent swimmers and both get easily offended. They all argue at a sleepover, but later make amends. They also participate in the indoor game of hide & seek at the Ellis residence, known to all four girls as \\"Mouse House\\". Marty- Sheila's swimming teacher, who struggles to work with Sheila because of her hydrophobia. When Sheila admits her problem to Marty, he works out a plan for her to prepare for the beginner's test. He is last seen at her house, having been invited by Mr. Tubman to attend his end of summer barbecue. Sheila at first failed to recognize Marty, then thinking it odd to see him on dry land and fully dressed.  Minor Characters Betsy Ellis - Mouse's younger sister, who is only 4 years old, but an excellent diver. She carries around a box on a string, which is a pretend dog she calls Ootch, due to her allergy to real dogs. Denise - A counselor at the camp who teaches pottery. Also chaperones a haunted hayride, where she convinces Sheila to stop hiding from her fears on that. Maryanne - An attractive teenage girl at the summer camp who wins the part of Wendy in the camp play of Peter Pan due to being a better singer than Libby. Despite Libby's annoyance at not getting the role, she and Maryanne become friends. Allen & Paul - Two teenagers from the camp who are the only ones to complete Sheila's crossword challenge of naming all the camp counselors. When they ask for their prize, she gives them the camp newspaper. However, the two boys seem to be more appreciative and competent at running the paper than did Sheila, also changing the paper's name from Newsdate with Sheila the Great to Allen and Paul: Tell All. Mrs. Reese - A neighbor of the Tubmans from Manhattan. She has a small dog named Baby, who is the only dog Sheila can stand prior to overcoming her fear of dogs. Bobby - The boy whose room Sheila stays in while his family is vacationing in England. Sheila is dismayed at sleeping in a room like a boy's, having convinced herself the house in Tarrytown would be girlie. The Tubmans later see a letter from him expressing his disdain at having a girl in his bedroom and announcing he acquired a bunch of model airplanes which he will take back to the States. Peter Hatcher - Shiela's classmate and star of the preceding book, only seen when he shares an elevator ride with Sheila and his dog Turtle, whom Sheila fears. Also mentioned in the middle of the night when Sheila sees a real spider and must overcome her fear of it, remembering how back in school Peter tried to scare her with a fake spider but she didn't fall for it (but it scared their teacher and Peter got three days of detention)! Freddie - a lifeguard at the community pool and yet another young gentleman whom guy-crazy teenage Libby finds appealing. She always flirts with him at his guardstand and runs to fetch him beverages. Upon finding out he already has a girlfriend, however, she loses her spark for him Dedication Judy Blume dedicated the book to her father and her mother. Revised editions The post-2002 reprints of this book have some lines edited and a bit of new content added to update the technology use in it (for instance, record players are replaced with CD players, and the camp's copier keeps malfunctioning, which is why Sheila must use a mimeograph machine, whereas the original had them already still using their mimeograph machine and not having a copier yet).

The US Geological Survey defines anoxic groundwater as those with dissolved oxygen concentration of less than 0.5 milligrams per litre. This condition is generally found in areas that have restricted water exchange. In most cases, oxygen is prevented from reaching the deeper levels by a physical barrier as well as by a pronounced density stratification, in which, for instance, heavier hypersaline waters rest at the bottom of a basin. Anoxic conditions will occur if the rate of oxidation of organic matter by bacteria is greater than the supply of dissolved oxygen. Anoxic waters are a natural phenomenon,Richards, 1965; Sarmiento 1988-B and have occurred throughout geological history. In fact, some postulate that the Permian‚ÄìTriassic extinction event, a mass extinction of species from world's oceans, resulted from widespread anoxic conditions. At present anoxic basins exist, for example, in the Baltic Sea,Jerbo, 1972;Hallberg, 1974 and elsewhere (see below). Recently, there have been some indications that eutrophication has increased the extent of the anoxic zones in areas including the Baltic Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and Hood Canal in Washington State. Causes and effects Anoxic conditions result from several factors; for example, stagnation conditions, density stratification,Gerlach, 1994 inputs of organic material, and strong thermoclines. Examples of which are fjords (where shallow sills at their entrance prevent circulation) and deep ocean western boundaries where circulation is especially low while production at upper levels is exceptionally high. In wastewater treatment, the absence of oxygen alone is indicated anoxic while the term anaerobic is used to indicate the absence of any common electron acceptor such as nitrate, sulfate or oxygen. When oxygen is depleted in a basin, bacteria first turn to the second-best electron acceptor, which in sea water, is nitrate. Denitrification occurs, and the nitrate will be consumed rather rapidly. After reducing some other minor elements, the bacteria will turn to reducing sulfate. This results in the byproduct of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a chemical toxic to most biota and responsible for the characteristic \\"rotten egg\\" smell and dark black sediment color. SO4‚àí2 \\\\+ H+1 ‚Üí H2S +H2O + chemical energy If anoxic sea water becomes reoxygenized, sulfides will be oxidized to sulfate according to the chemical equation: HS‚àí \\\\+ 2 O2 ‚Üí HSO4‚àí or, more precisely: (CH2O)106(NH3)16H3PO4 \\\\+ 53 SO42‚àí ‚Üí 53 CO2 \\\\+ 53 HCO3‚àí \\\\+ 53 HS‚àí +16 NH3 \\\\+ 53 H2O + H3PO4 Anoxia is quite common in muddy ocean bottoms where there are both high amounts of organic matter and low levels of inflow of oxygenated water through the sediment. Below a few centimeters from the surface the interstitial water (water between sediment) is oxygen free. Anoxia is further influenced by biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of oxygen used by marine organisms in the process of breaking down organic matter. BOD is influenced by the type of organisms present, the pH of the water, temperature, and the type of organic matter present in the area. BOD is directly related to the amount of dissolved oxygen available, especially in smaller bodies of water such as rivers and streams. As BOD increases, available oxygen decreases. This causes stress on larger organisms. BOD comes from natural and anthropogenic sources, including: dead organisms, manure, wastewater, and urban runoff. In the Baltic Sea, the slowed rate of decomposition under anoxic conditions has left remarkably preserved fossils retaining impressions of soft body parts, in Lagerst√§tten. Human caused anoxic conditions Eutrophication, an influx of nutrients (phosphate/nitrate), often a byproduct of agricultural run-off and sewage discharge, can result in large but short-lived algae blooms. Upon a bloom's conclusion, the dead algae sink to the bottom and are broken down until all oxygen is expended. Such a case is the Gulf of Mexico where a seasonal dead zone occurs, which can be disturbed by weather patterns such as hurricanes and tropical convection. Sewage discharge, specifically that of nutrient concentrated \\"sludge\\", can be especially damaging to ecosystem diversity. Species sensitive to anoxic conditions are replaced by fewer hardier species, reducing the overall variability of the affected area. Gradual environmental changes through eutrophication or global warming can cause major oxic-anoxic regime shifts. Based on model studies this can occur abruptly, with a transition between an oxic state dominated by cyanobacteria, and an anoxic state with sulfate-reducing bacteria and phototrophic sulfur bacteria. Daily and seasonal cycles The temperature of a body of water directly affects the amount of dissolved oxygen it can hold. Following Henry's law, as water becomes warmer, oxygen becomes less soluble in it. This property leads to daily anoxic cycles on small geographic scales and seasonal cycles of anoxia on larger scales. Thus, bodies of water are more vulnerable to anoxic conditions during the warmest period of the day and during summer months. This problem can be further exacerbated in the vicinity of industrial discharge where warm water used to cool machinery is less able to hold oxygen than the basin to which it is released. Daily cycles are also influenced by the activity of photosynthetic organisms. The lack of photosynthesis during nighttime hours in the absence of light can result in anoxic conditions intensifying throughout the night with a maximum shortly after sunrise. Biological adaptation Organisms have adapted a variety of mechanisms to live within anoxic sediment. While some are able to pump oxygen from higher water levels down into the sediment, other adaptations include specific hemoglobins for low oxygen environments, slow movement to reduce rate of metabolism, and symbiotic relationships with anaerobic bacteria. In all cases, the prevalence of toxic H2S results in low levels of biologic activity and a lower level of species diversity if the area is not normally anoxic.

Because of the novel's content it has been the frequent target of censorship and appears on the American Library Association list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990‚Äì2000 at number seven.... Plot summary Katherine, in the middle of her senior year in high school, finds herself strongly attracted to Michael, a boy she meets at a New Year's party. As their relationship unfolds, the issue of sex comes up more as an emotional and health issue than as a moral one. Both of them are aware that physical intimacy is both common and complicated. Their relationship progresses slowly as they begin to go on dates and trips together; they are accompanied on various meetings by Katherine's friend, Erica, who has known Katherine since the 9th grade and believes that sex is a physical act and not very romantic, and believes Katherine should \\"just get it out of the way.\\" Erica and Katherine are also joined by Michael's friend Artie, who got together with Erica; they split up after he told her he was going to kill himself, but he didn't harm himself. He is a depressed teenager who doesn't know what to do with his life. He shows his depression when he attempts to hang himself from his shower curtain rod but fails and gets himself hospitalized for the rest of the novel. Katherine and Michael go on a skiing trip, where they plan to have sex, but Katherine has her period, and they are disappointed. Michael teaches Katherine how to hold his penis (nicknamed \\"Ralph\\") and how to rub it correctly. When Katherine and Michael do have sex on Michael's sister's living room floor in her apartment, they are sure it seals a love that will be \\"forever\\". Michael buys Katherine a necklace for her birthday that says both of their names on it and it also says \\"Forever\\". However, separated for the summer by work that takes them to two different states, Katherine finds herself aware of the limitations of the relationship and is ultimately attracted to a tennis instructor, Theo, who is older than Michael. Theo calls her Kat, because everyone else is doing it, even though she is highly irritated with the nickname. She shares a kiss with him, and takes responsibility for breaking the news to Michael when he comes on a surprise visit. Michael realizes she has found someone else, and Katherine gives him back the forever necklace before he takes off. She realizes that she could get over it. The book ends with Katherine's mother giving her a message that Theo called for her.  Characters  Major Katherine Danziger Protagonist of the book. Katherine is almost 18, and turns 18 in the book, and is a senior in high school who is getting ready for college. When she meets Michael, she falls in love with him, and starts a relationship with him. One of the novel's central plotlines is her decision to lose her virginity to him as well as the sexual relationship they share together. After she split off with Michael she started one with Theo. Michael Wagner The boy who Katherine meets and with whom Katherine falls in love. He is a senior at another high school nearby. They meet at a New Year's Eve Party, and their relationship develops from there. Michael wanted to make love to Katherine, but tried not to pressure her into it too much and respected her for not being ready, until she was ready to let go of her virginity. He nicknamed his penis \\"Ralph.\\" They manage to hold a relationship together for a few months before it fell apart. Erica Small Katherine's best friend, who provides her with emotional support owing to Erica's ability to see situations from a realistic point of view. She sees sex as a physical act, not a romantic one, unlike Katherine, and just wanted her to get over with it. Artie Lewin A boy who is friends with Katherine and Michael. He is not very confident about himself and after Erica breaks up with him at a party, he scares her by saying he will commit suicide. Two days later he attempts to, resulting in him not graduating from high school and his hospitalization for the rest of the book. Minor Ralph Michael's penis. Sybil Davison Katherine's friend (and Erica's cousin) who later gets pregnant when having loveless intercourse because she wanted to have experience in giving birth.

For this reason, anyone reputed as a weather-maker was the subject of respect, fear, and hatred in rural areas. Perhaps the best known work on tempestarii was an 815 AD piece called \\"On Hail and Thunder\\" by a bishop, Agobard of Lyon. Some describe it as a complaint of the irreligious beliefs of his flock, as villagers resented paying tithes to the church, but freely paid a form of insurance against storms to village tempestarii; but, it was also noted, whenever a supposed weather-maker failed to prevent a storm, he or she would generally suffer the wrath of the populace, being victimised or killed. A closer examination of Agobard's writing shows that he actually argues against the existence of weather-witches, but acquiesces that the saints of God are able to cause these things by praying with faith. He is more concerned with his flock's misunderstanding that these \\"witches\\" are obtaining power from the devil, and subsequent eagerness to kill or curse anyone able to work miracles. His key argument is that anyone capable of \\"raising a gale\\" would be one who has faith in God, a Christian, not a witch, because witches are not able to do such things. > \\"Perhaps the ones who attribute the making of hail to men would say that > Moses reached his staff up to heaven and in this sense the storm was sent by > human agency. Certainly Moses, the servant of God, was good and righteous, > but these people do not dare to say that the so-called ‚Äòstorm-makers‚Äô are > good and righteous, but rather evil and unrighteous, deserving of both > temporal and eternal condemnation, nor are they servants of God, except > perhaps by circumstance rather than willing service. For if there were men > who could cause hail, in imitation of Moses, they would surely be servants > of God, not servants of the devil; although the passages cited above show > that neither servants of God nor those of the devil cause of hail, but only > omnipotent God... no human assistant should be sought in such events, > because none will be found, except perhaps the saints of God, who have > brought about, and are yet to bring about, many things.

A righteous man or a sinner? > For a sinner, partly unbelieving like you, cannot raise a gale, as you put > it, because he is not able to by his own strength, nor can he command evil > angels (nor do evil angels even have power in these matters).\\" > https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/source/Agobard-OnHailandThunder.asp Agobard of Lyons also referenced a related belief amongst his parishioners‚Äîa belief that tempestarii were in league with a mythical race of cloud-dwellers who came from a land named 'Magonia' (\\"Land of Magic\\", \\"Land of Thieves\\"). The Magonians were supposed to sail the skies in storm clouds; they would then pay Frankish tempestarii to summon up storms over farmlands, during which the Magonians could swoop down and steal the corn from the fields. On the particular occasion which prompted Agobard to write, several supposed Magonians had been taken prisoner by irate villagers shortly after a bad storm; the Bishop had been forced to intervene and debate with the villagers in order to save the prisoners' lives. Storm raising During the witch hunts the belief in witches who could raise storms was not limited to the Tempestarii. Depending on a witch's preference, they were believed to cause tempests, hailstorms, and lightning. Witches struck homes and crops alike, sank ships, killed men and animals, and it was believed they took great delight in the process. Church authorities gave credence to the belief by stating that God permitted the Devil and witches to perform these acts as punishment for the wickedness of the world. Since ancient times around the world, the ability to control elements‚Äîincluding the raising of storms and causing rain‚Äîhas been attributed to magicians, shamans, sorcerers, and witches. As early as 700 A.D., the Catholic Church prosecuted sorcerers for causing storms. The most famous storm believed to be caused by witches was recorded in 1591 during the North Berwick Witch Trials. John Fian and his alleged coven of witches were accused of raising a sea storm to drown James VI and Queen Anne on their way from Denmark. On the Tempestarii and Magonia see Valerie I. J. Flint, The Rise of Magic in Early Medieval Europe, Princeton Univ. Press, 1991, p. 112\\\\. Remedies against tempestarii The Catholic Church prohibited superstitious remedies against witchcraft such as storm raising because the remedies themselves were of pagan origin. Prayer, sacraments, and the invocation of the name of God were prescribed instead with the belief that a person who had strong faith in God, kept the commandments, and revered the rites of the Church would be immune from storms and tempests raised by malicious witches. Because many peasants were reluctant to give up their superstitions as being false, the church also sanctioned remedies like the ringing of church bells, believed to drive storm devils away, and placing charms made from flowers consecrated on Palm Sunday in the crop fields. It was believed that if a storm did strike after the charm was placed, the owner's crops would be protected even if the surrounding land and crops were destroyed.

Type 89 flexible type Type 89 \\"modified single\\" (Te-4 Machine Gun) The second machine gun is gas-operated, it consists of two modified Type 11 machine guns paired into a single unit, similar to the German MG 81Z. It is commonly referred to as the \\"flexible type\\". It was derived from otsu-gou - an experimental machine gun (1922-1929) which was a Type 11 turned on its side and fed from pan magazine. The machine gun was chambered in 7.7x58mmSR Type 89 cartridge, it used an \\"Y\\"-shaped metallic stock, spade grips, the barrels had no cooling fins (contrary to Type 11), it was fed from two quadrant-shaped 45-round pan magazines (each magazine has a place for nine 5-round stripper clips).http://mpopenker.livejournal.com/1630937.html The machine gun was used as a rear gun on aircraft and some were pressed into ground and anti-aircraft use. Single or doubled Type 89s were used in most Imperial Japanese Army aircraft that had flexible defensive weapons, including the Mitsubishi Ki-21, Ki-67 and Nakajima Ki-49 heavy bombers, the Mitsubishi Ki-30, Ki-51 and Kawasaki Ki-32 light bombers, the Tachikawa Ki-9 (for training purposes only), and various other aircraft in the Army Air Force inventory. Additionally, there was also the Te-4 machine gun (the Te designation was given to firearms under 11mm, and Ho to larger weapons such as the 12.7mm Ho-103 heavy machine gun and 20mm Ho-5 autocannon), the machine gun bore a strong resemblance to otsu-gou (of which Type 89 \\"flexible\\" was a derivative), due to that fact it was assumed to be a further modification of the double-barrelled machine gun, as such it was referred to as Type 89 \\"modified single\\". It is uncertain whether the Te-4 was a direct derivative of otsu-gou or it was a result of splitting the Type 89 \\"flexible\\".

A An illustration of the Pre- Columbian abacus: the Nepohualtzintzin * Abacus ‚Äì the Aztec and Maya of Mesoamerica performed arithmetic operations using an abacus. It served as a more accurate and faster alternative to a written out solution or relying on memory alone. This Mesoamerican abacus, the Nepohualtzintzin, has been dated by archaeologists to had first been present in Mesoamerica from about 900‚Äì1000 CE, and possibly earlier. * Abstract art ‚Äì abstract art was used by nearly all tribes and civilizations of North and South America. Indigenous art was believed to be primitive until the 1890s when it served as inspiration for the modern American abstract art movement. See also Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas. Adobe buildings at Cuarenta Casas * Adobe ‚Äì adobe was used by the peoples from South America, Mesoamerica, and up to Southwestern tribes of the U.S. It is estimated that it was developed around the year 3000 BCE. * Agave wine ‚Äì is made from the same plant, blue agave, as tequila but with a lower alcohol content. * Almanacs ‚Äì almanacs were invented independently by the Maya peoples. Their culture arose, and presumably began using almanacs, around 3,500 years ago, while Europeans are known to have created written almanacs only after 1150 CE. Almanacs are books containing meteorological and astronomical information, which the Maya used in various aspects of their life. * Alpacas ‚Äì the Andean civilizations were amongst the first to domesticate alpacas. * American football ‚Äì the Iroquois claim to have played football. While no specification is made as to whether this is meant to be American football or soccer. Soccer is said to have been invented in Asia.Froman, Frances & Keye, Alfred J. \\"English-Cayuga/Cayuga-English Dictionary\\" 2014. * Anesthetics ‚Äì indigenous peoples used coca, peyote, datura and other plants for partial or total loss of sensation or consciousness during surgery. Western doctors had effective anesthetics only after the mid-19th century. Before this, they either had to perform surgery while the patient dealt with the pain or they needed to knock the patient out unconscious. * Apartment blocks ‚Äì the Ancestral Puebloans (Anasazi) and other tribes which once thrived in the present day Southwest of the US, developed complex multistory apartment complexes, some of which are still in use today. Pueblo communities in present-day New Mexico continue to reside in some of these ancient multistory apartment complexes‚Äìwhich were constructed by their ancestors many centuries ago‚Äìeven before the first apartments were built in the United States during the 18th century. Pueblo Bonito, one of the seminal archaeological sites today, is an example of this indigenous multistory apartment complex construction from the Anasazi and Hohokam time periods; approximately dating back one thousand years ago. Nazca monkey *Art to be viewed from space ‚Äì the Nazca Lines were created by the ancient Nazca culture in modern-day Peru. The Nazca built these artworks, which could only be viewed from the sky or from space. It was as if the Nazca were building monuments, which only their gods could view from up in the sky. Some of these artworks, otherwise known as the Nazca Lines, could only be viewed from the sky and each one of these works of Nazca art spans several miles across in size and dimension in the Sechura Desert. * Aqueducts ‚Äì the ancient Andean cultures such as Chimu, Moche and Nazca lived in very dry environments, yet they were able to sustain large scale agriculture consisting of a wide variety of crops by employing aqueducts connecting various freshwater sources, such as mountain streams and lakes to their agricultural fields which were sometimes injecting pressure with the aid of puquios (wind-based water pumps). The Inca later expanded on these already constructed aqueducts and built even more complex and large aqueduct system in the Inca Empire. The Mesoamerican Aztecs also constructed complex, dual-pipe aqueducts to supply their vast city of Tenochtitlan. * Aspirin ‚Äì indigenous Americans have been using willow tree bark for thousands of years to reduce fever and pain as were the peoples of Assyria, Sumer, Ancient Egypt and Ancient Greece. When chemists analyzed willows in the last century, they discovered salicylic acid; the basis of the modern drug aspirin. * Asymmetric warfare ‚Äì Araucanian leaders such as Lautaro developed effective military tactics to counter the Spanish invasion, winning the Arauco War. These tactics consisted in a combination of espionage, cattle raiding, and using attack waves in the battlefield to exhaust the enemy. * Astronomy ‚Äì Mesoamerican cultures, such as the Maya and Aztec, were able to accurately predict astronomical events, like eclipses, hundreds of years into the future. * Atlatl ‚Äì Paleo-Indians (Beringian Diaspora) from over 11,500 years ago had developed a highly developed spear thrower in the form of the atlatl to hunt woolly mammoths, giant sloths, mastodon, muskox (euceratherium), giant beaver, early caribou, steppe bison, saber-toothed cat, and other Pleistocene animals. Using the atlatl, these ancient Paleo-Indians were able to traverse much of the Americas from Alaska, down to Mexico, Central America, South America, and, finally, all the way south into Chile as they hunted and followed these Pleistocene megafauna within a short 3,000 year time period‚Äìfrom about 14,500 years ago to about 11,500 years ago.Paleo- Indians * Avocado ‚Äì indigenous Americans were the first to domesticate and cultivate avocados.https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/nrcs141p2_024206.pdf  B  Solid rubber ball * Balls, rubber ‚Äì the Olmec produced rubber balls around 1700 BCE. They were the first people to develop and play with rubber balls as well as manufacture other objects of rubber.Filloy Nadal discusses the Aztecs' use of \\"ancient rolling technique\\" (page 30) while Ortiz discusses the use of this technique by the Olmecs (page 244). * Beans ‚Äì most commonly eaten beans today were originally cultivated in the Americas by indigenous Americans. Beans (Phaseolus), along with squash and maize, formed the \\"Three Sister (crops)\\" which were grown by many pre-Columbian American cultures, tribes, nations, and civilizations. * Board games ‚Äì various indigenous cultures had board games, among these can be found: Komikan (South America), Patolli (Mesoamerica), Tukvnanawopi (Hopi culture), etc. * Bolas ‚Äì bolas are a type of throwing weapon made of weights on the ends of interconnected cords and were initially used to capture animals via the entanglement of their legs. Bolas were used in the Andes and Patagonia where indigenous peoples‚Äìparticularly the Tehuelche‚Äìused them to catch 200-pound guanaco and √±and√∫. * Bottle gourds ‚Äì the ancient Mexicans learned to first cultivate bottle gourds around 8,000 BCE. Indigenous peoples grew bottle gourds for use as bowls, scoops, colanders, ladles, spoons, canteens, and dippers. Larger gourds were used as cooking vessels. The indigenous peoples of the Eastern Woodlands hung bottle gourds on poles in their cornfields to serve as habitats for insect-eating birds (a form of biological pest control, which they developed). Indigenous Americans in northern Peru also used bottle gourds as floats for fishing nets.\\"Transoceanic drift and the domestication of African bottle gourds in the Americas\\", Kistler et al, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, February 10, 2014. * Bulletproof vest ‚Äì Ichcahuipilli, was a military armor used by various Mesoamerican cultures. It consisted of a layered cotton shirt, at least 2 inches thick, hardened with brine and other substances. It was originally intended to protect the wearer against projectiles and other weaponry, such as spears, arrows, and obsidian swords, but later was discovered to be capable of stopping musket shots.Phillips, Charles \\"The Complete Illustrated History of the Aztec & Maya: The Definitive Chronicle of the Ancient Peoples of Central America & Mexico - Including the Aztec, Maya, Olmec, Mixtec, Toltec & Zapotec\\" 2015. * Bunk bed ‚Äì the Iroquoian longhouses housed several families together. The concept of bunk beds was developed by these Native American peoples, since these longhouses included several bed combinations which featured one bed built on top of another, akin to bunk beds in modern times.  C  The Aztec Calendar Stone * Calendars ‚Äì calendars were developed by indigenous Americans throughout North America, Mesoamerica, and South America. They are known to have been in use since 600 BCE. Some calendars were so precise, that by the 5th century BCE, they were only 19 minutes off.Miles, Susanna W, \\"An Analysis of the Modern Middle American Calendars: A Study in Conservation.\\" In Acculturation in the Americas. Edited by Sol Tax, p. 273. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1952. * Canals ‚Äì the Aztecs constructed great canals used for transporting food, cargo, and relaying people to the chinampas (floating gardens used for growing food) in their great metropolis of Tenochtitlan.Walker, C. 1980, p. 162. * Canoe ‚Äì many indigenous nations‚Äìincluding the Caribs, Cree, Iroquois, and others‚Äìhad developed many distinct forms, styles, and types of canoes over the millennia.Canoe * Cassava ‚Äì the first cultivation of cassava took place in southern Brazil and eastern Bolivia 8,000-10,000 years ago. * Causeway ‚Äì the Aztec built many giant causeways that connected the mainland to their capital city of Tenochtitlan, located in the heart of the Aztec Empire. The causeways served as arteries used for transporting food, goods, people, captive warriors, and wastes during the heyday of the Aztec Empire in the 14th century to the 16th century.Coe, M. 2008, p. 193. * Chaps ‚Äì these appear to have been first used as a sort of leather armor to protect the legs from injury during guerrilla attacks by east coast native peoples. Some of these peoples ended up migrating to Texas shortly before the Texas Revolution, where it appears that others discovered that wearing chaps over pants reduced chafing on long horseback rides. It came to be later adopted by US, Mexican, and indigenous horse-riding cultures. * Chewing gum ‚Äì Native Americans in New England introduced the settlers to chewing gum made from the spruce tree. The Mayans, on the other hand, were the first people to use latex gum; better known to them as chicle. One of the few remaining chinampas at Xochimilco * Chinampa ‚Äì floating gardens, which were highly productive areas used for farming and growing food, were constructed by the Aztecs to provide food and sustenance to their 250,000 inhabits in the city of Tenochtitlan. The Aztecs used the chinampas in and around Tenochtitlan to grow corn, squash, beans, tomato, avocado, chilli peppers, and a plethora of other food products to feed the burgeoning population of their great metropolis. * Chocolate ‚Äì the Maya civilization was the first to drink cocoa. This tradition was later passed on to the Aztecs, who called the beverage xocalatl. Indigenous people in Mesoamerica introduced it to the Spanish and Portuguese, but they kept the beloved xocalatl from the rest of Europe for nearly a century. * Chunkey ‚Äì a Native American game where a person rolls a hoop covered in a leather strap framework and tries to hit it with spears or arrows. This may have inspired the sport of skeet shooting.\\"Chumash Indians-Sports and Recreation\\". Retrieved 2008-09-16. *Compass (possibly) ‚Äì the Olmec are known to have knowledge of magnetism. The discovery of a hematite artifact has led many experts to believe that Olmec invented the compass 1,000 years before the Chinese did, although some still are not convinced.. Lodestone Compass: Chinese or Olmec Primacy?. Retrieved February 2015. * Compulsory education ‚Äì the Aztec Triple Alliance, which ruled from 1428 to 1521 CE, is considered to be the first state to implement a system of universal compulsory education.Wikipedia: Aztec#Education * Corn (maize) ‚Äì the domestication of maize, now cultivated throughout the world, is one of the most influential technological contributions of Indigenous Americans. * Corn beer ‚Äì brewed in the Andes, it is of pre-Incan origin from the Wari culture. * Cornmeal ‚Äì an unsoaked meal (coarse flour) ground from dried maize. It is a common staple food, and is ground to fine, medium, and coarse consistencies. * Cranberries ‚Äì Native Americans were the first to domesticate and grow cranberries in the north east coast of the United States.  D  Detail of Nezahualc√≥yotl's dam to control water levels around Tenochtitlan * Dams ‚Äì the Aztec in Tenochtitlan constructed great dams during the heyday of the Aztec Empire. Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec empire, was first built on a small island that was located in the western section of Lake Texcoco in 1325 CE. The Aztec created various large artificial islands around the small island using a system that was similar to building the chinampas (floating gardens in the lake that was used to grow food for the cities' population). To provide drinking water to the cities' population of over a quarter of a million inhabitants, the Aztec built a system of dams that separated the salty waters of the lake from the rainwater that was accumulated during periods of heavy rains. The Aztec also used the dam to control the level of water in the lake and prevent their city from being flooded during times of heavy rains. To prevent flooding, the Aztec constructed an inner system of channels that helped to control the water level and held the level steady during flooding and periods of intense rains. Hern√°n Cort√©s, and the other Spanish conquistadors, destroyed these engineering marvels that the Aztec had developed during the previous 200 years. * Dog breeds ‚Äì Native American dogs believed to have been bred by indigenous Americans are the xochiocoyotl (coyote), xoloitzcuintli (known as xolo or Mexican hairless), chihuahua, Peruvian Hairless Dog, the Carolina Dog, Canadian Eskimo Dog, and the Alaskan Malamute.  E  Children of Llullaillaco found at Llullaillaco in Salta Province (Argentina) * Electroplating ‚Äì the Moche independently developed electroplating technology without any Old World influences. The Moche used electricity derived from chemicals to gild copper with a thin layer of gold. In order to start the electroplating process, the Moche first concocted a very corrosive and a highly acidic liquid solution in which they dissolved small traces of gold. Copper inserted into the resulting acidic solution acted both as a cathode and an anode, generating the electric current needed to start the electroplating process. The gold ions in the solution were attracted to the copper anode and cathode and formed a thin layer over the copper, giving the latter the appearance of a solid gold object, even though gold only coated the outermost layer of the copper object. The Moche then allowed the acidic solution to boil slowly, causing a very thin layer/coating of gold to permanently coat the copper anode and cathode. This battery-less electroplating technique was developed around 500 CE by the Moche, a thousand years before Europeans invented the same process.H. Lechtman, \\"A Pre-Columbian Technique for Electrochemical Plating of Gold and Silver on Copper Objects,\\" Journal of Metals 31 (1979): 154‚Äì60New perspectives on Moche Metallurgy: Techniques of Gilding Copper at Loma Negra, Northern Peru, Heather Lechtman, Antonieta Erlij, and Edward J. Barry online abstract via www.jstor.org * Embalming ‚Äì Egyptians are known for mummification, which began around 6000 BCE to 600 CE. In what is now Chile, however, the Chinchorro peoples are known to have been embalming and mummifying their dead since around 5000 BCE. Embalming is using preservatives to prevent decay of the body. Many other indigenous American peoples further perfected the art of embalming and mummification including the skilled Moche peoples in present-day Peru. * Ephedra ‚Äì the Aztecs used ephedra in order to treat common colds. Unlike the Chinese version of the ephedra, the New World ephedra that was used by the indigenous Americans contained milder alkaloids.  F  Chu√±o, a freeze dried potato * Freeze-drying ‚Äì the Andean civilizations learned to freeze dry potatoes (chu√±o) and other food items, so that the resultant dehydrated powder could be stored for years and then later transported across vast distances to feed countless hungry peoples. The Spanish conquistadors used this Andean invented freeze-drying technique to transport several tonnes of dehydrated potatoes across the Atlantic Ocean back to Europe to feed hungry Europeans.  G  * Green bean ‚Äì this, as well as other varieties, were first farmed in South America and migrated to North America where it was adopted by Europeans. * Guinea pigs ‚Äì indigenous South Americans had domesticated the guinea pig as a food source around 9000 to 6000 BCE. The Inca people took guinea pig farming to new heights. Two guinea pigs H * Hammocks ‚Äì hammocks were commonly used in the Caribbean, South and Central America at first contact with Europeans. The Spanish liked the comfortable way of sleeping and adopted them. Europeans eventually used them as the primary way of sleeping on ships. * Harpoons ‚Äì the Inuit had developed the harpoon independent of any Old World influences, in order to hunt seals, walrus, and whales. The Inuit of West Greenland called the harpoon, maupok. Harpoons enabled the Inuit to hunt large marine mammals from a distance in the umiak and kayak in the open Arctic Ocean. * Hominy ‚Äì this is a specialized corn dish known by many North American native people. Today, it is most commonly seen in the Southern United States.Chafe, Wallace L. \\"Handbook of the Seneca Language (North American Indian Languages Edition)\\" 2007. * Hockey ‚Äì both field hockey and ice hockey are based on a game called shinny. This indigenous stickball game was played throughout North America well before the European arrival. * Horse breeds ‚Äì Appaloosa and Pinto.  I  Inside an igloo * Igloos ‚Äì built by the Inuit, igloos were constructed for many centuries as a form of protection and shelter to house people from the harsh Arctic weather. While the temperature outside an igloo may have been , the temperature within an igloo was stable ranging from when warmed by body heat. The Central Inuit people in Northern Canada (especially those, who lived around the Davis Strait), lined the inside living area of an igloo with animal skin and hides. This assisted in increasing the temperature within an igloo from around to , thereby insuring a more comfortable existence for the inhabitants of the igloo from the fierce cold outside. With the addition of a kudlik the temperature could be raised even more. * Inca road systems ‚Äì the Inca built one of the most extensive road systems in the ancient world. The Incas built upon the roads, which were originally constructed by previous Andean civilizations such as the Chimu, Nazca, Wari, Moche, and others. The Inca also further refined and expanded upon the earlier innovations and systems laid in place by previous Indigenous cultures. The Incan road system, at its peak, spanned over and crisscrossed mountains, rivers, deserts, rainforests, and plains. The road system connected the empire from the Andes mountain in Colombia all through Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, northeastern Argentina, and present-day northern Chile. The Inca roads were used to transport food, goods, people, and armies, while Inca officials frequently relayed messages using the roads across the vast stretches of the Inca Empire. In areas, where rivers blocked the directions of the roads, the Inca constructed elaborate and complex rope bridges. * Inuit snow goggles ‚Äì the Inuit made snow goggles which protected their eyes against the harsh winds in the Arctic regions of North America, long before sunglasses became available to modern Europeans. Snow goggles  J  * Jerky ‚Äì indigenous Americans were the first to develop jerky from smoked buffalo meat.  K  * Kayak ‚Äì originally developed by the Inuit, Yupik, and Aleut to hunt on inland lakes, rivers and coastal waters of the Arctic Ocean, North Atlantic, Bering Sea and North Pacific oceans  L  Llama overlooking Machu Pichu * Lasso ‚Äì the Lenape and early settlers allegedly record the use of the lasso as a sort of snare to trap large game. The Lenape eventually brought this to Texas, where it came to be implemented by the American and Mexican cowboy cultures. * Lacrosse ‚Äì lacrosse may have developed as early as 1100 CE among indigenous peoples on the North American continent. * Llamas ‚Äì indigenous people from Peru domesticated llamas in around 5000 BCE.  M  * Maize ‚Äì first cultivated in present-day Mexico several thousand years ago, corn is currently the most cultivated grain in the world with the US being the largest cultivator of maize followed by mainland China. Over 700 million tons of maize are grown worldwide annually today in order to feed people and animals. In addition, ethanol extracted from corn is also used to fuel engines in millions of vehicles, thousands of planes, and other engines throughout the world. * Manioc ‚Äì Native Americans were the first peoples in the world to cultivate manioc. * Maple syrup and maple sugar ‚Äì indigenous Americans were the first to extract the sap from maple trees and convert the sap into maple syrup and maple sugar. * Mathematics ‚Äì the Olmec and the Maya‚Äìwho succeeded the Olmec‚Äìindependently developed the concept of zero (independent of the ancient Hindus in India) in mathematics. The ancient Mexicans also developed complex arithmetic functions and operations such as additions, subtractions, divisions, and multiplications. The development of mathematics by the Mexicans assisted them in making sense of the universe, cosmos, astronomy, architecture, and pre-Columbian calendars that were so essential in maintaining a connection between them and the gods and heavens. * Metallurgy in pre-Columbian America ‚Äì many pre-Columbian cultures, especially the Moche in the Andean regions were skilled metallurgists. Indigenous Americans mastered smelting, soldering, annealing, electroplating, sintering, alloying, low-wax casting, and many other metallurgical techniques independent of any Old World influences. The Moche were skilled in hammering and shaping gold, silver, copper, and bronze into intricate ornamental objects and chisels, while the later Incas developed more utilitarian objects using these metals and alloys. Metallurgical techniques later diffused from the Andean region of South America to Colombia and then later to Mesoamerica, where local artists and metallurgists developed even more unique techniques using a wide range of material, including alloys of copper-silver, copper-arsenic, copper-tin and copper-arsenic-tin. * Moccasins ‚Äì highly comfortable shoes used by indigenous Americans to travel vast distances. These shoes were often made of leather and were highly comfortable to wear. In addition, the moccasins could withstand the rugged terrain over which Native Americans traversed. Beaded moccasins originally from the estate of Chief Washakie, Wind River Indian Reservation (Shoshone), Wyoming, c. 1900 * Muscovy duck ‚Äì indigenous peoples were the first in the world to domesticate the muscovy duck.  N  * Nixtamalization ‚Äì the process originated in Mesoamerica, with the earliest evidence of its presence found in Guatemala's southern coast with equipment dated to 1200-1500 BCE.  O  Maya observatory: El Caracol * Observatories, astronomical ‚Äì Andean and Mesoamerican astronomers constructed towers to observe the movements of the planets and other astronomical features and events. Although culture groups throughout the world have observed the planets and stars and recorded their movements, the stone structures of the Mesoamerican and Andean culture groups are significant because they show the emphasis these early astronomers placed on making clear and accurate observations. In the U.S., the Anasazi built structures with windows aligned for the observation of celestial events. The most notable example of Maya astronomical observatories is Caracol, in Chich√©n Itz√°. In 1975, archaeoastronomers Anthony F. Aveni and Horst Hartung surveyed the site and suggested that ancient Maya astronomers used the structure to observe the planet Venus. The Maya, as well as other Mesoamerican culture groups, used Venus to set times for ceremonies and as a divination tool.  P  * Painting ‚Äì Classic period Maya paintings, found in the archaeological sites of Cacaxtla and Bonampak, are some of the most refined paintings ever to come out of the ancient Americas. Besides the Maya, other indigenous civilizations were also known for their wall paintings, including the Aztec and the Navajo, who developed the art of sand painting. The palace observation tower at Palenque * Palaces ‚Äì indigenous American civilizations such as the Olmecs, Mayans, Zapotecs, Aztecs, Mixtecs, Moche, Toltecs, Inca, Chim√∫, Nazca and many more built elaborate palaces. The Mayan palace in Palenque is one of the best examples of Mayan palace architecture. * Parkas ‚Äì the Inuit in the Arctic were the first peoples in the world to develop parkas. Parkas are great insulators, which protected the Inuit against the harsh Arctic winter. The pocket of air that was located within sewed caribou fur in a parka, protected a person against the brutal Arctic winter. * Papaya ‚Äì indigenous people residing around the Caribbean Sea and Mexico, such as the Mayans, domesticated papayas. * Peanuts ‚Äì indigenous Americans were the first peoples in the world to cultivate peanuts. * Peanut butter ‚Äì the Inca and Aztec processed ground roasted peanuts into a paste similar to peanut butter. * Pemmican ‚Äì indigenous Americans were the first to develop pemmican as a nutritious and high-energy food. * Pepper ‚Äì Mesoamericans were the first to cultivate peppers, including chili peppers of all types and sweet red, green, yellow, and all other colorful hues of non-chilli peppers. * Petroleum use ‚Äì Native Americans in present-day Pennsylvania, the Iroquois, lit petroleum which seeped from underground to fire ceremonial fires. In addition, they also used petroleum to cover their bodies against insect bites and as a form of jelly to prevent their skins from drying out.Early Native American Oil Discoveries * Peyote ‚Äì indigenous people realized the antibiotic property of peyote and used the extract to treat fevers and enhance the energy in their bodies and treatment as an anesthetic. * Pineapple ‚Äì indigenous people residing in what is now Brazil and the Paran√° River valley of Paraguay were the first to cultivate the pineapple. From there, pineapple cultivation spread to Mexico, Central and South America and the Caribbean. Indigenous Americans used the pineapple as a source of food. * Planned city construction ‚Äì ancient cities in Mexico‚Äìsuch as Teotihuacan and the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan‚Äìincorporated planned city design, including streets laid out in a grid pattern. * Plumbing ‚Äì the Maya have been found to be the earliest inventors of plumbing in Mesoamerica, with the earliest example of a pressurized water system being constructed in 750 CE‚Äîor earlier. This pressurized water system was located in the Maya site of Palenque, where public baths and toilets were accessible to the residents of the ancient city. * Popcorn * Potato ‚Äì first cultivated in the Andean regions of South America by Andeans. It was principally cultivated in Peru and Bolivia. * Pot roast ‚Äì in one of the Lakota legends recorded in Lakota mythology, the character Wohpe is seen creating a dish in exactly the same manner as we make pot roasts today‚Äîsealing a large chunk of meat and vegetables in a bag and steaming it in a pot.Jahner, Elaine A. & DeMallie, Raymond J. \\"Lakota Myth\\" 2006. Teotihuacan incense burner lid * Pottery ‚Äì many indigenous American cultures and peoples independently invented and then refined pottery in the Americas into fine works of art, as well for utilitarian usage. The Moche and Maya were some of the best potters from the ancient Americas, and their work still inspires awe amongst us for the level of artistry, creativity, and sophistication, which such highly prized works of arts involved. The Navajo are also very skilled developers of pottery and their works in the present time are highly detailed and much prized. Many other indigenous American cultures also developed their own pottery styles during the pre-Columbian time periods and continued to refine their artwork into the modern era. * Pulque ‚Äì corn-based alcoholic beverage created in Mesoamerica sometimes called agave wine. Still popular in Mexico today. * Pumpkins ‚Äì indigenous Americans were the first to domesticate and grow pumpkins. * Pyramids ‚Äì advanced civilizations in Mexico, such as the Toltecs, Olmecs, Zapotecs, Aztecs, Mayans, Mixtecs, developed their own myriad styles of pyramids, usually step pyramid, which served for ceremonial/religious and administrative functions. In Mesoamerica, the largest pyramid in the world‚ÄîThe Great Pyramid of Cholula‚Äîbegan to be constructed by the inhabitants of Cholula in the 3rd century BCE. In the Andean regions, the Moches, and some ancient Peruvians also constructed gigantic pyramids as well without any influence from Old World civilizations.  Q  Quinoa at Lake Titicaca, Bolivia * Quinoa ‚Äì first grown and cultivated in the Andes. This is a food grain which the indigenous Americans first developed and the grain is considered to be one of the most nutritious items there is. * Quinine ‚Äì a muscle relaxant, which has been used for many centuries by the Quechua people in the Andes area of South America. The medicine was used by many Andean people to prevent shivering due to cold in the low-temperature areas in the high Andes mountains of Peru. The ancient Peruvians would mix the ground bark of cinchona trees with water to eliminate the bark's bitter taste, and then drink the resultant tonic water to soothe their nerves and senses. * Quipu ‚Äì quipus were developed by the ancient Andeans. Quipus mimic an accounting, record-keeping, and communication system that uses knots and strings in order to record valuable information related to population, economic data, food grain supplies, calendars, events, etc.  R  * Rubber ‚Äì the indigenous cultures of Mesoamerica were the first peoples in the world to extract the sap from rubber trees and then use it to make clothes, rubber balls to be played in ceremonial ball games, and many other utilitarian uses. Indigenous peoples, especially those who lived in the Amazon rainforest found many other uses for rubber. The science and technique of extracting sap from rubber trees and then using the sap to make goods made of rubber then spread to the high civilizations of the Andes and elsewhere in the Americas. * Rubber balloons ‚Äì the Olmec were the first people to use rubber balloons. Their civilization arose in 1700 BCE in the Yucat√°n Peninsula.Encyclopedia of American Indian Contributions to the World * Reed boats ‚Äì a balsa was a boat that was constructed by pre-Columbian South Americans from woven reeds of totora bullrush. These reed boats varied in size from that of a small canoe used for navigation, transportation, and for small-scale fishing to large ships of up to in length, which were used for war, transportation, bulk goods hauling, and transporting royalty and nobility. They are still used today on Lake Titicaca in Peru and Bolivia by the indigenous peoples living along the banks of the lake.  S  * Salsa ‚Äì one of several sauces typical of Mexican cuisine. * Sauna ‚Äì the temazcal was a sweat lodge used by many cultures in Mesoamerica and the Great Plains. A Lakota (Sioux) chanunpa pipestem, without the pipe bowl * Smoking pipe ‚Äì indigenous Americans invented the smoking pipe and in particular the ceremonial pipe a type of tobacco pipe. This was an unknown concept to Europeans and the idea was adopted by them and was shortly thereafter brought to the Chinese. * Snowshoes ‚Äì invented and then used first in the Americas by the indigenous tribes, which resided in the cold areas of North America in order to travel across a snow-laden landscape, especially during the long winter months, that gripped all of the region. * Spinning top ‚Äì known from Mesoamerican times. A device used as a toy and made out of wood.Encyclopedia of American Indian Contributions to the World * Spruce beer ‚Äì a beverage made using pine needles. Also called pine beer and nettle beer, it was most likely originally brewed by First Nations, and predates the arrival of Europeans.Ebberts, Derek (9 March 2015). \\"To Brew or Not to Brew: A Brief History of Beer in Canada\\". Manitoba Historical Society. Manitoba Historical Society. Retrieved 28 January 2017. \\"Quebec was the geographic epicentre of the development and expansion of the brewing industry in Canada.\\" * Squash ‚Äì the people of southern Mexico were the first to grow squash. Squash along with maize (corn) and beans represented the three sister crops of the ancient Mesoamericans. * Sundials ‚Äì the Inca and other pre-Columbian Americans constructed elaborate sundials for both ceremonial and religious purposes, but also for record-keeping. * Sunflower ‚Äì indigenous Americans were the first peoples in the world to cultivate the common sunflower. * Suspension bridge ‚Äì the ancient Maya constructed a suspension bridge over the Usumacinta River in Yaxchilan. This Maya Bridge at Yaxchilan would have been one of the longest bridges in use in the ancient past. The bridge was constructed in the 7th century CE and was a very long suspension bridge with a relatively level pathway. * Syringe ‚Äì indigenous American medicine men used syringes and hypodermic needles made from materials fashioned from hollow bird bones and animal bladders to inject medicine into sick patients and treat the illness of the patients.  T  Nez Perce tipi * Tamales ‚Äì although largely associated with Mexico, and its indigenous Mesoamerican origin, records from the Iroquoian people show that they too made such a dish. * Taxation ‚Äì the Inca had a sophisticated taxation system, the mit'a, using quipus (knotted strings) as recording devices. Quipus were transported through the Inca road network messengers (chaskis) and administered by the quipu authorities (quipucamayoc).D'altroy, Terence N. (2001). 18 * Tipi ‚Äì a cone-shaped, portable dwelling popularized by Plains Indians (Native Americans and First Nations) of the Great Plains and the Canadian Prairies. Tipis were warm, durable, comfortable, and could be easily disassembled and packed. A settlement could be ready to move in about one hour. * Tlingit armor ‚Äì Tlingit armor was worn by coastal Indigenous nations in Alaska and British Columbia. Tlingit warriors wore battle helmets depicting either crest animals or ancestors, along with wooden visors, thick leather tunics, and body armor covered with wooden slats or coins. This battle attire combines technology, ingenuity, and symbolic power and protection. * Tobacco ‚Äì tobacco was used in the Americas for many centuries prior to the arrival of white Europeans. Consumed in high doses, tobacco can become highly hallucinogenic and was accordingly used by many indigenous peoples in the Americas to inspire dreams and dreamtime. Tobacco was also often consumed as a medicine amongst some tribes, although this was strictly practiced by experienced shamans and medicine men. Eastern tribes in the mainland US also traded tobacco as a trade item in exchange for food, clothing, beads, and salt, and would often smoke tobacco during sacred and ritualized ceremonies using pipes. Tobacco was considered to be a gift from the gods and it was believed that the exhaled tobacco smoke generated from smoking a pipe would carry one's thoughts and prayers to the creator up above in the heavens. * Toboggan ‚Äì the Innu and the Cree nations of Canada developed a sled in the form of the toboggan. These sleds were used to transport people and cargo across the snow using dogs as draft animals. Sled dogs such as Huskies were used to pull the dog sled along the harsh Canadian winter snows. * Toggling harpoon ‚Äì first used by the Red Paint People of the North American east coast, they were later used by the Thule. * Tomato ‚Äì indigenous Americans were the first peoples in the world to domesticate and cultivate the tomato by 500 BCE. The tomato was an essential ingredient that formed the basis of many indigenous foods including tamales, tostado, soups, and salads. * Tortillas ‚Äì this staple food well known today was used throughout Mesoamerican and Southwestern US cultures. Although they were mainly made of corn, squash and amaranth were also popular. The tortillas were wrapped around different fillings such as avocado. Today this has resulted in the creation of the modern taco, burrito, and enchilada. * Tug of war ‚Äì the Iroquois claim tug of war was once related to a sort of celebratory ritual they used to practice. The Mohave people occasionally used tug-of-war matches as means of settling disputes.Homicide, Race, and Justice in the American West, 1880-1920, Page 133. * Turkey ‚Äì approximately 2,000 years ago, ancient Mesoamericans domesticated the turkey during the Late Preclassic period‚Äîfrom 300 BCE to 100 CE.  U  An ulu in the western Arctic style * Ulu ‚Äì a multi-purpose knife normally used by Inuit, Yupik and Aleut women * Umbrellas ‚Äì independent of the ancient Chinese (who had also invented the umbrellas on their own), the Maya and the Inca had invented circular umbrellas, which were made from bird feathers.  V  * Vanilla ‚Äì the Totonac are believed to had been the first to extract vanilla from the pods of vanilla orchids and use it as a flavor enhancer. * Vulcanization ‚Äì the Olmec people of Veracruz, Mexico treated the sap from rubber trees with chemicals and shaped the resulting rubber into a myriad of products such as balls, sandals, balloons, rubber syringes, etc. centuries before Charles Goodyear re-invented the process during the 19th century.  W  * Water gun ‚Äì some of the first water guns were more of a syringe-type device. The missionary Eugene Buechel recorded the Lakota peoples as making such toys for their children out of log rounds. However, whether or not they actually invented the device is up for debate.Buechel, Eugene & Manhart S.J., Paul \\"Lakota Dictionary: Lakota-English / English-Lakota, New Comprehensive Edition\\" 2002. * Whaling ‚Äì indigenous peoples, such as the Inuit, have been whaling for many centuries using boats as part of a subsistence economy. Their whaling tradition in the Arctic region predates European colonization of the Americas. An Aztec toy dog on wheels * Wheel and axle ‚Äì Mesoamericans invented wheels but only used these as toys. The oldest wheeled figure to have been uncovered in Mesoamerica is a crowned, dog-like figure in Tres Zapotes, Veracruz, dated ca. 100-200 CE. The most common examples of the Mesoamerican wheel and axle are Aztec clay wheeled toys. * Whoopee cushion ‚Äì natives of the great plains were known to use animal bladders as whoopee cushions to play practical jokes on each other. They were so popular, a common Lakota myth actually depicts a sorcerer using an animal bladder to put a spell of flatulence on a girl who spurned him. * Wigwam ‚Äì a wigwam, wickiup, or wetu is a domed room-dwelling formerly used by certain Native American and First Nations tribes, and still used for ceremonial purposes. The wigwam is not to be confused with the Plains tipi, which has a very different construction, structure, and use. Apache wickiup, by Edward S. Curtis, 1903 * Writing system ‚Äì many indigenous American cultures, such as the Olmec, Maya, Aztec, Zapotec, and Toltec, developed writing systems. Other native peoples to the north‚Äîmainly Algonquians‚Äîhad organized pictographing, a common precursor of writing. The Mi'kmaq used a pictographic or hieroglyphic writing system prior to European arrival.  X   Y  * Yam ‚Äì indigenous Americans in the Guyana region of South America domesticated the most important New World yam: D. Trifada * Yucca ‚Äì the plant was cultivated throughout the Americas, and is mostly distributed in coastal lowlands and dry beach scrub of coastal areas.  Z  The back of Stela C * Zero ‚Äì the Olmec independently invented the concept of zero. The second earliest found instance of the use of zero‚Äîin Mesoamerica‚Äîhas been dated to 32 BCE by the Epi-Olmec culture. This date has been arrived at based on the Long Count date on Stela C at Tres Zapotes. The symbol used for \\"zero\\" is a shell glyph, which is seen on the stone carving. Although the Olmec didn't leave behind any statues or reliefs with a \\"zero\\" glyph, the use of the Long Count calendar requires the knowledge of this concept since it is based on a (vigesimal) place-value number system.

He played his college football at Oregon State, where he was a successful option quarterback. Early life Born in Idaho Falls, Preece grew up in Boise and played high school football at Borah for legendary coach Ed Troxel, also his coach in track. At the talent-rich program, Preece had to wait his turn to play. Opened in 1958, Borah had won or tied for the conference title and mythical state title (writers' poll) in each of its first six years. Preece became the Lions' starting quarterback during his senior year in the fall of 1964. The Borah Lions were undefeated entering the final game against rival Boise on Veterans Day, but allowed the Braves to overcome a ten-point deficit in the second half to gain their first win in seven tries over Borah, and the Lions had to settle for second place for the first time in the conference and final state poll. In March 1965, Preece helped lead the Lions to their first state title in basketball, winning the A-1 (largest schools) state tournament in Pocatello, defeating Twin Falls in the final to finish the season with a 24‚Äì1 record. College career After graduating in 1965, Preece accepted a scholarship to Oregon State, recruited by linebackers coach Ed Knecht. Knecht had previously been the head coach at rival Boise High, and had connections in southwestern Idaho. Preece had great speed (10.0 in the 100 yard dash), and a good arm, a great fit for the option offense. Knecht had received a phone call warning him that a rival school was attempting to steal Preece away from the Beavers, so he promptly called new head coach Dee Andros with the news, to which Andros responded, \\"Get the $@%! over there. And if you don't get him, don't bother to come back.\\" (Andros was previously the head coach at the University of Idaho. Knecht was a former assistant coach at Idaho and a future athletic director (1969‚Äì74).Go Vandals.com ‚Äì Ed Knecht ‚Äì accessed 2012-03-09 As a sophomore in 1966, Preece split time as the starting quarterback with senior Paul Brothers. After Brothers' graduation, Preece was the starter for the 1967 and 1968 seasons, and the Beavers compiled a record. Included in this success was a win and a tie against UCLA, and a split with USC and O. J. Simpson. The Beavers won 3‚Äì0 in 1967, the Trojans won 17‚Äì13 in 1968 in Los Angeles. The 1967 OSU football team finished with a record of 7‚Äì2‚Äì1 and a #7 ranking in the AP national poll. OSU defeated previous #1 USC in Corvallis, and #2 Purdue on the road, and tied #2 UCLA in Los Angeles, earning them the title of \\"The Giant Killers.\\" OSU also beat the Iowa Hawkeyes on the road, but a mid-season lapse of consecutive losses to unranked teams severely damaged the Beavers' Rose Bowl chances and national ranking. OSU lost to the Washington Huskies in Seattle, and BYU Cougars in Corvallis. Although OSU defeated USC, the Beavers wound up behind in the Pac-8 conference standings with a loss and a tie. Conference champion USC defeated Indiana 14‚Äì3 in the Rose Bowl and was crowned national champion for the 1967 season. Oregon State did not play in a bowl game, due to conference rules; the Pac-8 (and Big Ten) did not allow a second bowl team until the 1975 season. They were seventh in the final AP Poll, released in December. Oregon State went 7‚Äì3 in 1968 and finished #15 in the nation in the final AP Poll, released in January. Professional career Undrafted, Preece signed a free agent NFL contract with the New Orleans Saints in 1969, not as a quarterback but as a defensive back. He was traded to the Philadelphia Eagles for the 1970 season, staying through 1971, and playing one game for them in 1972 before being traded to the Denver Broncos. In 1973, Preece was traded to the Los Angeles Rams, where he would play for four seasons, the last two as a back-up, the only time in his career. He played his last season in 1977 as a starter for the Seattle Seahawks, and had four interceptions. Following off-season surgery on his left knee, Preece announced his retirement in July 1978. As a professional, Preece played a role similar to Nolan Cromwell, a defensive back who held for place kicks and was available to play quarterback in an emergency; both had been option quarterbacks in college. After football Preece is in the real estate business in Portland and regularly provides color commentary for the Oregon State football broadcasts.

He was the founding general director of The Santa Fe Opera, a company he oversaw for 43 years. Early life A bout of asthma interrupted Crosby‚Äôs early studies in Connecticut; this caused him to attend the Los Alamos Ranch School in New Mexico for a year. It was Crosby‚Äôs first introduction to the West and, specifically, to the Santa Fe area. After graduating from The Hotchkiss School, Crosby served in the US Army for two years between 1944 and 1946, with time spent in Europe and some with the 18th Regimental Band handling piano, violin, trombone and double bass. Attending Yale as an undergraduate soon followed; with it came consideration of several future professions, including law and becoming an airline pilot. But at Yale he studied composition with Paul Hindemith and created musical arrangements for musical productions. He graduated with a degree in music in 1950.  Career  Having decided that music was to be his life, Crosby spent a few months as an assistant arranger for Broadway musicals before returning to graduate studies at Columbia University between 1951 and 1955. During these years, he became an opera lover, attending the Met regularly and working as the piano accompanist assistant to Dr. Leopold Sachse, the former artistic director of the Hamburg State Opera, and teacher of opera classes at Columbia. In 1951, during a period of regular attendance at the Met as a standee, Crosby saw the Alfred Lunt production of Cosi fan tutte,\\"Mozart at the Met\\", Time, 7 January 1952 which influenced him greatly in developing a concept for the future Santa Fe Opera.in Phillip Huscher, The Santa Fe Opera: an American Pioneer (see below), p.32: \\"Crosby saw something happen on the stage of the Met that he had never seen before: \\"a carefully, brilliantly rehearsed evening with six superb singing actors\\". That, he later realized, was the spark that inspired The Santa Fe Opera...\\" Founding of The Santa Fe Opera prior to 1957 During the three years preceding Santa Fe‚Äôs first season in 1957, Crosby meticulously planned for its creation, helped and encouraged by Dr. Sachse. Asked in a 1991 interview why he founded the company, Crosby responded: \\"Because of Rudolf Bing\\" and he went on to explain that Bing's influential productions at the Met in the 1950s had caused him to regard opera \\"as a serious art form\\". By this time, Crosby's parents had bought a second home on land located about three miles (5 km) north of Santa Fe. Close to this location, the San Juan Ranch, a guest ranch, became available and, sponsored by his father with a loan of $200,000 to the fledgling company (of which $115,000 would build the theatre and the balance would buy land) the purchase was completed. From this location Crosby and Sachse (who was to be artistic director) carefully selected the specific site of the open-air theatre, which was planned to seat 480 and to be \\"the only outdoor theatre in America exclusively designed for opera\\".Eleanor Scott, see below In addition, Crosby calculated that about $60,000 was needed to be raised to support the first summer‚Äôs operations; in the end, only $50,000 was raised but $40,000 was taken at the box office with about 12,850 people attending. Several things characterized Crosby‚Äôs approach to the presentation of opera in Santa Fe: all operas were to be sung in English to make them as accessible as possible; staging, costuming and lighting were emphasized, as was acting. The 13 singers who were engaged were mostly young (all between 21 and their early thirties); and the innovation which was most revolutionary in the world of opera in America in the 1950s was the creation of the apprentice system, whereby the company hired a group of young singers to serve as chorus members, understudies for the main roles, and singers in secondary roles. As Crosby noted: :In this country young artists have to do something which is impossible ‚Äì gain experience. But with our plan, these young people will be scheduled in small roles and will have the opportunity of working with their older brothers and sisters who have already won their spurs. To get such experience now, a young artist has to go to Europe.Eleanor Scott, see below The current Apprentice Program for Singers and Technicians (Technicians were added in 1965) continues at The Santa Fe Opera today. Annually (as with the 2013 season), 1,000 singer applicants competed for 43 positions and, of the 900 technician applications, 90 were chosen as apprentices. Some apprentices are invited to return for a second season. =The first season, 1957= The program for the first season was characteristic of most of the seasons which Crosby subsequently programmed. It was an adventurous one consisting of five operas in rotating repertory. There were two fairly popular ones, Madama Butterfly (presented on 3 July 1957, opening night) and Il barbiere di Siviglia; a world premiere, on this occasion Marvin David Levy‚Äôs The Tower (coupled with Pergolesi‚Äôs La Serva Padrona); a Richard Strauss opera, Ariadne auf Naxos (many more ‚Äì including many American premieres ‚Äì were to follow in later seasons due to Crosby's love of that composer's work); and, finally, a major coup for Crosby and the company, Igor Stravinsky‚Äôs The Rake's Progress with the composer present for two weeks in July. Photographs exist of the composer attending rehearsals. The first six performances were sold out and, in spite of some rainouts during what turned out to be one of Santa Fe‚Äôs wettest summers, the season was an unquestionable success, creating both national and international attention. Achievements 1957 to 2000 The Crosby Theatre, Santa Fe Opera's third theatre on the site, which opened in 1998 Plaque outside The Crosby Theatre commemorates the contributions of the founding general director, John Crosby, and his parents Lawrence and Aileen Crosby‚Äôs tenure as general director was the longest of any opera company director in the US. In addition, between 1957 and 2005, the company staged 135 operas, 11 of which were world premieres and 41 were American premieres. Among the commissioned works which Crosby presented as world premieres are Carlisle Floyd‚Äôs Wuthering Heights during the second season in 1958 and Tobias Picker‚Äôs Emmeline in 1996, while distinguished American premieres include six operas by Richard Strauss (beginning with Capriccio, also a part of the second season in 1958) and six operas by Hans Werner Henze between 1965 and 2000. Igor Stravinsky was to return to Santa Fe each summer until 1963 during which time he was given ‚Äúan unmatched musical pulpit‚ÄùSmith, Craig, \\"He Changed Santa Fe\\", The Santa Fe New Mexican, 16 December 2002. with performances of six operas ranging from Oedipus Rex (1960) to Le Rossignol (1962 and 1963). Under Crosby‚Äôs tenure, several distinguished singers made significant appearances at The Santa Fe Opera. In the case of two singers, Kiri Te Kanawa (in 1971 as the \\"Countess\\", prior to beginning her international career later that year in England) and Bryn Terfel (in 1991), these were US debuts. Some singers, such as Samuel Ramey, who was a former apprentice, returned in Carmen in 1975; other American singers such as Jerry Hadley, Dawn Upshaw, Patricia Racette and Susan Graham and James Morris (another apprentice), appeared early in their careers and several return regularly. Crosby‚Äôs final appearance on the podium, while also serving as General Director, was on 24 August 2000, conducting the last night of Strauss‚Äô Elektra. It was his 171st time conducting a Strauss opera and approximately his 567th time as conductor of the opera company. Upon retirement, Crosby was succeeded by Richard Gaddes, who had been involved with the company since the late 1960s, initially as artistic administrator. Retirement and awards Crosby retired to Palm Springs but continued to be involved with the opera company, conducting La traviata during the 2002 season. Over his career, Crosby‚Äôs involvement in the world of opera included the presidency of the Manhattan School of Music for a decade from 1976, and a four-year presidency of the opera organization, Opera America from 1976. In addition to five honorary doctorates, Crosby received the National Medal of Arts in 1991 and, in 1992, the German Order of Merit for services to German music. Crosby died in California on 15 December 2002 and was buried at the Santa Fe National Cemetery.

Under the pseudonym Vazeh, which means \\"expressive, clear\\", he wrote in both Azerbaijani and Persian, developing the traditions of poetry in both languages. He wrote the first anthology of Azerbaijani poetry and the Tatar-Russian Dictionary for the Tiflis gymnasium with Russian teacher Ivan Grigoriev. He has written multiple ghazals, mukhammases, mathnawis and rubais. His poems were mostly intimate- lyrical and satirical. The main theme of Vazeh's works was the glorification of romantic love and joy of life, but in some of his poems, Mirza Shafi denounced the vices of feudal society, opposed slavery and religious fanaticism. The German poet Friedrich von Bodenstedt, who took oriental language lessons from Vazeh, published translations of Vazeh's poems in his book \\"A Thousand and One Days in the East\\" in 1850. Later, Bodenstedt's book, titled \\"Songs of Mirza Shafi\\" was published in 1851. Biography =Birth Date= Mirza Shafi Sadyq oglu was born at the turn of the 18th-19th centuries in Ganja. The exact birth date of the poet is disputed. Encyclopedias such as Great Soviet Encyclopedia, Concise Literary Encyclopedia and the state that Mirza Shafi was born in 1796, but number of other authors write that he was born in 1794. According to the orientalist Adolf Berge, he saw \\"a modest, about 60 years old Turk\\" in the streets of Tiflis in 1851, who was Mirza Shafi Vazeh. This would mean that the poet was born before 1800. The archive documents, on the other hand, contain completely different information. In the \\"formal list about the service for 1845\\" () it is written that Mirza Shafi is 40 years old. This would mean that Vazeh was born in 1805. At the same time, in the \\"formal list of service for 1852\\" (), it is stated that he is 45 years old, indicating that he was born in 1807. According to orientalist Ivan Yenikolopov, the most trustworthy source is the \\"formal list about the service for 1845\\" which was approved by Mirza Shafi's commander-in-chief A.K. Monastyrski. \\"Battle of Ganja\\" by Adolf Charlemagne depicting the Russian attack on Ganja Fortress =Early Life= Mirza Shafi's father was Sadyk Kerbalayi, or more commonly Usta Sadyk, who served as an architect for Javad Khan, the last khan of Ganja Khanate. The poet's elder brother, Abdul-Ali, became an architect like his father. Mirza Shafi was born in the years of Russian conquest of the Caucasus. In 1804, Mirza Shafi's hometown, Ganja was sieged and eventually captured by Russian forces. After the capture, general Pavel Tsitsianov renamed Ganja to Elisabethpol (in honour of Russian empress Elizabeth Alexeievna) and integrated the territory of the khanate as Elisabethpol Uyezd. Mirza Shafi's family were seriously affected by these events as his father lost his income. Orientalist Adolf Berge, citing M.F.Akhundov, noted that after the fall of the Ganja Khanate, Mirza Shafi's father suffered and went bankrupt, then fell ill and died sometime after. His father's death date is unknown, though literary critic Aliajdar Seidzade argues that he died in early 1805. Mirza Shafi's father's bankruptcy is confirmed by a letter sent from a poet by the name of Shakir to poet Gasim bey Zakir, in which ‚ÄúSadyk from Ganja‚Äù (Mirza Shafi's father), along with a certain Haji-Qurban, are mentioned as being rich men, who became completely impoverished. According to historian Mikhail Semevsky, Mirza Shafi was \\"a kind, simple man who was Tatar by origin, and Persian by upbringing.\\" =Education in Madrasa= Shah Abbas Mosque of Ganja where Mirza Shafi studied Shafi's interest in books and science showed itself from early ages. Because of this, his father sent him to the madrasa of Shah Abbas Mosque in Ganja. His father's wish was for his son to become a mullah. Shafi's sphere of interest and abilities expanded in the madrasa, as he learned Persian and Arabic language and was taught calligraphy. Adolf Berge wrote in his article called \\"Journal of the German Oriental Society\\" (): Shafi did not want to become a mullah. He wished to learn literature and different languages. Though as long as his father was alive, Shafi didn't want to go against his father's wish, so he continued his education in the madrasa until his dad's death. At the time of his father's death, when Shafi was still studying in a madrasa, a certain someone named Haji Abdullah was returning from Tabriz to Ganja. According to Adolf Berje, Haji Abdullah was \\"of remarkable spiritual qualities and high morality.\\" This Haji Abdullah played a significant role in shaping the personality of Mirza Shafi. According to Adolf Berge, Haji Abdullah was born in Ganja and went to Tabriz to engage in trade. In Persia, he visited holy places and later made a pilgrimage to Mecca. Later, he lived in Baghdad for some time where he met a dervish named Seid Sattar, who taught him about Sufism. After returning to Ganja, Haji Abdullah constantly argued with local mullahs and akhoonds of the Shah Abbas mosque, trying to prove the inconsistency and absurdity of religious prejudices and superstitions. Because of this, he made enemies with much of the local clergy. Haji Abdullah enlightened the young Shafi, who was at that time a student of the madrasa. Seeing such a turnaround in the mindset of young Shafi, the mullahs of the madrasa refused to continue studying with him. After this, Shafi was forced to leave the madrasa and from here, according to Berge, development of Shafi's complete contempt for the clergy begins. In his arguments with the mullahs, Mirza Shafi supported Haji Abdullah, who, according to Aliajdar Seizade, adopted him. Literary Activity In 1840 Vazeh moved to Tiflis where, with help of his former student Mirza Fatali Akhundov, he secured the position of teacher at a boys' school. In Tiflis, Vazeh became even more devoted to literature. In 1844 he established a literary society \\"Divan-i Hikmet\\" which gathered many prominent Azeri, Russian and foreign intellectuals living in Tiflis. Grave monument of Mirza Shafi Vazeh in Tbilisi Among the members of this society was Friedrich Martin von Bodenstedt, a German poet and traveler, who became Vazeh's friend and student in the Azeri and Persian languages and literature. Vazeh rarely put his verses into written form, due to the high cost of pens, paper and ink in the region, and his friends transcribed most of his works during their gatherings. Von Bodenstedt was one of the scribes, and translated Vazeh's poetry into German, upon his return to Germany. His first book about Shafi was entitled Thousand and One Days in the Orient.\\"The Songs of Mirza-Schaffy\\" (1876) Lippincott's Magazine, Vol.17 pp.367‚Äì375Friedrich Martin von Bodenstedt, Richard Waddington (translator) (1851) The Morning- Land; or, A Thousand and One Days in the East, Richard Bentley, London This contained an account of Bodenstedt's sojourn in Asia and included many of Shafi's poems. His publisher asked him to issue separately the poems contained in it and as a result these were published in 1851 as a book named Die Lieder des Mirza Schaffy (The Songs of Mirza Shafi),Die Lieder des Mirza-Schaffy (1851) translated by Friedrich Bodenstedt (German) which contained many additional poems. It was translated into English by Elsa d'Esterre-Keeling in 1880. The book became popular, was republished and translated into other European languages. However, after Vazeh's death in 1852, F. von Bodenstedt denied Vazeh's authorship claiming that they were his own verses and he presented them as belonging to Vazeh in order to add an exotic air to the book in order to enhance its popularity. While the truth of this claim is difficult to determine because no original manuscripts from Sufi have been found in Germany, there is little doubt that Sufi's poems were distorted and added to in translation. Only a few original manuscripts have survived to this day in Azerbaijan. Two were found in 1964.Alboma Qayƒ±t (June 4, 2014) \\"Mirz…ô ≈û…ôfi Vazeh/Mirza Shafi Vazeh adlƒ± birinin ≈û…ôkill…ôri\\", Facebook Vazeh's verses, which were translated and published throughout Europe in the 19th century gained attention in Azerbaijan only at the beginning of 20th century. Azerbaijani philologists, S. Mumtaz and H. Hamidzade, played a key role in collecting and publishing those of Vazeh's original verses which have been preserved to date. In his poetry, Vazeh glorifies the joys of life, and the wisdom and goodness of man. He was also critical of the clergy and was accused of being an apostate. Research into Shafi's writings is far from complete and continues in Azerbaijan to this day.

After the collapse of the First Serbian Uprising in 1813 Karaƒëorƒëe and his son Aleksa stayed in a monastery for a month. There is a memorial plaque as a testimony. Also on the same occasion, until 1815, monks from Studenica stayed there, along with the relics of St. King Stefan Prvovenƒçani. The monastery was also the place where Karaƒëorƒëe met archpriest –ú–∞teja. In the First World War the monastery was set on fire, and in the Second World War in 1942 it was almost completely devastated.  The Architecture  The monastery complex consists of the church, the chapel, the mansion and the economic part. The church, built in 1797 and dedicated to St. Petka dominates the complex. The church was built as a one-nave Baroque building with the bell tower above the western part and the smaller dome above the transept. The iconostasis[B. Gavriloviƒá, Some of the woodcarving centres in Vojvodina, The work of Vojvodina museums, Novi Sad, 1954] inside the church from 1798 was the work of the famous woodcutter from Novi Sad, –êksentije Markoviƒá .[The works of the woodcarver Aksentije Markoviƒá, The church of St. Peter and Paul in Bela Crkva, the Monastery Beoƒçin, the Monastery Bezdin; he is the author of the first Baroque sculpture in Novi Sad ‚Äì ‚ÄûThe Sacrifice of Noah‚Äú (the bell tower of Alma≈°ka church) ‚Äì the work is not saved; K.

The frescoes on the walls, the work of a Zemun painter Dimitrije Petroviƒá from 1859, have not been saved up to now. The mansion which are placed inside the monastery complex date back from the late 18th and early 19th century. According to the archive records they were built long before that, but were demolished over the time and used for the construction of the new ones. The rich library, which was known as one of the most important Fru≈°ka gora monastery, was situated in the mansion, but during the First World War it was completely destroyed. The records of doctor Archibald Reiss testify about that event.[I. Veskoviƒá, The house of doctor Archibald Reiss, The Cultural Heritage Protection Institute of the City of Belgrade ] In the immediate vicinity of the church, there is a monastery chapel dedicated to St. Petka. It was built above the well, which was believed to have been built by mother Angelina Brankoviƒá. People believed that the water from this well had miraculous healing power.  ‚ÄûThe Golden Cross‚Äù  The milestone, also known as ‚ÄûThe Golden Cross‚Äú proves the large size of the monastery property. It is placed on the right side of the road connecting Jakovo and Boljevci, about 400 m after the Fenek monastery turning. On 20 January 1743 the Empress Maria Theresa assigned ‚Äûthe privilege‚Äú to the Fenek monastery, according to which the property was granted to the monastery. Immediately after that, the bounding of the monastery property was done. The milestone was erected in 1747, thanks to Nikola Markoviƒá, and it got the name after the folk tradition, according to which the Serbs rushed to get hold of this milestone, since they felt safe on the monastery property. That is why the monument bears the name Golden cross ‚Äì as the symbol of salvation.  The Cultural Monument  Within the property of the Fenek monastery and its protected environment there are several archaeological sites: Fenek Mnastery (Middle Ages), Monastery Prnjavor (late Middle Ages) and Monastery fields (Neolithic). The monastery was reconstructed in 1991, and nowadays it is completely renewed. Until 2006, three older nuns lived in the monastery, one of them, sister Agripina died, and the remaining two were moved to other monasteries, mother Paraskeva to the monastery Greteg and Abbotess Magdalina to Radova≈°nica. By the decision of the competent archimandrites of Srem Vasilije and Of Ra≈°ka and Prizren –êrtemije the new male monkhood arrived to the monastery in the middle of 2006, Marko from Sopoƒáani and Makarije from Deƒçani. Since then, the visits to the monastery increased and the reconstruction of the mansion is in progress.[The documentation of the Cultural Heritage Protection Institute of the City of Belgrade, according to the Law on Protection of Cultural Properties (‚ÄûThe Official Gazette SRS‚Äú no. 28/77) the decision was issued according to which the Fenek Monastery is designated as the cultural property of great importance to the Republic of Serbia (The Decision on designation, ‚ÄûThe Official Gazette SRS‚Äú no. 14/79). The immediate vicinity of this monastery, Protected environment around the cultural property of a great importance ‚Äì Fenek Monastery, enjoys the status of the unity under the previous protection.] The patron saint of the monastery is Venerable mother Paraskeva, celebrated on 27 October, the folk gathering and the fair is on 7 August.Manastir Fenek, Manastirska slava, retrieved on 12 February 2013.

Biography  He was born in NaranjoCarrera del lateral Alex S√°nchez - Nacion in Costa Rica's, Alajuela province. S√°nchez started his soccer career at the early age of 10 playing in the Minor League for the Deportivo Saprissa. He started by training twice a day with the club and soon advanced to playing full-time. In 1945 he started in the first ever National Youth Championship, where he won a national title for the first time in his career. By 1946 Saprissa had ascended to the Juvenile Division and Alex had become the starting goalkeeper. Saprissa won the Championship in the new division by beating the Liga Deportiva Alajuelense in a best-of-three series. The Championship allowed the Deportivo Saprissa, the Minor League branch of a Major League team named Orion F.C., to ascend to the Major Division. The team was renamed Orion F.C. and S√°nchez was moved into the position of left wingback. He remained in this position until his retirement. In 1947 S√°nchez played in the Third Division for the newly renamed Orion F.C. and again was part of the team that won the Championship. This continued success prompted Ricardo Saprissa, the team's co-founder and namesake, to register the team in the Third Division of the Major League. That same year the Orion F.C. won the Championship, thus advancing to the Second Division, where the team was renamed back to the Deportivo Saprissa. The next season, the Deportivo Saprissa advanced one last time to the Primera Division, Costa Rica's top soccer league. S√°nchez was part of the team that won the first three National Championship sin Costa Rica's top league in 1952,Los hist√≥ricos 30 t√≠tulos del Deportivo Saprissa - Naci√≥n 1953 and 1957.

They are located at the entrance of the larynx, extending from the lateral borders of the epiglottis to the arytenoid cartilages, hence the name 'aryepiglottic'. They contain the aryepiglottic muscles and form the upper borders of the quadrangular membrane. The folds are triangular in shape, being narrow in front, wide behind, and sloping obliquely downward and backward. They are bound, in front, by the epiglottis; behind, by the apices of the arytenoid cartilages, the corniculate cartilages, and the interarytenoid notch. Within the posterior part of each aryepiglottic fold exists a cuneiform cartilage which forms whitish prominence, the cuneiform tubercle. The aryepiglottic folds are shortened in laryngomalacia. Phonatory mechanism Under certain circumstances, the aryepiglottic folds take part in phonation, for instance in the singing technique of vocal growl, such as practiced by Louis Armstrong and other jazz singers. It has been proven that the approximation of the aryepiglottic folds during vocalization may establish sustained co-oscillations, at relatively low frequencies, producing the growl or growling effect.

It was founded as a company in 2001 by Sally Ride, America's first woman in space, along with Tam O'Shaughnessy, Karen Flammer, Terry McEntee, and Alann Lopes to inspire young people in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) and to promote STEM literacy. Sally Ride Science was relaunched at UC San Diego on October 1, 2015. It is based at UC San Diego Extension, and its programs are coordinated jointly by UC San Diego Extension, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and San Diego Supercomputer Center. O'Shaughnessy is executive director and Flammer is director of education for Sally Ride Science at UC San Diego.  Programs  Sally Ride Science at UC San Diego focuses on professional development for teachers; K-12 STEM + Arts (STEAM) education, including courses, lectures, and camps; and online programs through UCTV. The goal is to help educators build students‚Äô STEM literacy and make connections between what students are learning and the STEM fields that are expected to experience rapid job growth in the coming decades. The nonprofit will create new programs and make use of existing Sally Ride Science programs. Existing programs include Cool Careers in STEM, which provides professional development for teachers and classroom resources (student books, teacher guides, and a STEM Career Connections Teacher Activity Guide) to awaken students‚Äô interest in STEM topics and careers. Research shows that learning about STEM careers and the diverse people working in these fields inspires students and makes the study of science, technology, engineering, and math more meaningful to them. Another major existing program is Key Concepts in Science. This integrated standards-based program provides professional development for educators on how to teach science using the 5E instructional model, along with classroom resources (student books, hands-on investigations, teacher guides, and assessments) that educators can use to build students‚Äô STEM literacy and college and career readiness. The program reflects research showing that teaching fewer science concepts in greater depth gives students a solid foundation to develop STEM literacy. Activities Before its acquisition by UC San Diego, Sally Ride Science implemented a variety of STEM- related educational initiatives. The company: * organized 100 Sally Ride Science Festivals on college campuses around the country. * created and ran a National Engineering Design (TOYchallenge) competition for eight years and created a documentary film (Some Assembly Required) following five teams of boys and girls during the 2008 competition. * created 90 STEM and STEM careers books with comprehensive teacher guides, and more than 200 hands-on STEM investigations. * developed and held the Sally Ride Science Academy for six years, using a train-the-trainer model. * trained more than 30,000 teachers and reached more than 6 million students with STEM and STEM careers books. * operated EarthKAM (based on Sally Ride's idea to let students take photos of Earth from space and use them in their studies), engaging more than 600,000 students and their teachers in 80 countries. * helped spark the national discussion and shift the national perspective on the importance of involving girls and underrepresented minority students in STEM as they go through school and beyond.

It tells the story of the Sartoris family, who first appeared in the novel Sartoris (or Flags in the Dust). The Unvanquished takes place before that story, and is set during the American Civil War. Principal characters are Bayard Sartoris, John Sartoris (Marse John, Father), Granny, Ringo (Morengo), Ab Snopes, Cousin Drusilla, Aunt Jenny, Louvinia, and the lieutenant (a Yankee soldier). Plot summary Although The Unvanquished was first published as a whole in 1938, it consists of seven short stories which were originally published separately in The Saturday Evening Post, except where noted: *\\"Ambuscade\\" (September 29, 1934) *\\"Retreat\\" (October 13, 1934) *\\"Raid\\" (November 3, 1934) *\\"The Unvanquished\\" (namesake for the novel, in which it is titled \\"Riposte in Tertio\\") (November 14, 1936) *\\"Vend√©e\\" (December 5, 1936) *\\"Drusilla\\" (titled \\"Skirmish at Sartoris\\" in the novel), published in Scribner's (April 1935) *\\"An Odor of Verbena\\" (never published outside the novel prior to its release) The Unvanquished is told in seven episodes‚Äîsometimes immediately following one another, other times separated by months or years‚Äîspanning the years 1862 to 1873. The book begins with Bayard Sartoris and his slave friend Ringo playing in the dirt on the Sartoris plantation. A slave named Loosh smugly interrupts their game, hinting that Union armies have entered northeastern Mississippi, near their town of Jefferson. The boys do not fully understand, but when Bayard's father, Colonel John Sartoris, returns home from the front that day, they overhear him telling Granny Millard that Vicksburg has fallen. Loosh obviously knows about the defeat, and Bayard decides he and Ringo will keep watch over Loosh. Several days into the watch, the boys spot a Yankee soldier on horseback riding up the road. The boys grab a musket off the wall and shoot at the soldier, then run into the house as a fist pounds on the front door. Granny hides them under her billowing skirts and insists to the angry Union sergeant that there are no children present. Colonel Dick, a Yankee officer, calls off the search but makes it clear that he does so out of pity, not because he believes Granny. Afterward, the boys learn they only hit the horse, not the rider. The next year, following Colonel Sartoris's instructions, Granny carries a heavy trunk of silver to Memphis for safekeeping. After digging the buried chest out of the ground, she insists that the slaves carry it up to her bedroom so she can watch it during the night. The journey to Memphis carries them through Union- occupied areas. One afternoon, men with guns waylay the travelers, stealing their mules despite Granny's attempts to fend them off. Bayard and Ringo take a horse from a nearby barn and try to pursue the attackers, leaving Granny to fend for herself. They are discovered asleep the next day by Colonel Sartoris's troop. Furious and anxious for Granny's well-being, the colonel sees them back to Jefferson personally; on the way, they accidentally overcome the thieves, a group of Northern soldiers, and capture their supplies, though the colonel allows the men to escape. Granny has arrived home safely, but the next day a Union brigade rides to the house looking for Colonel Sartoris. He escapes, but the Yankees burn the house and take the chest of silver. Granny decides to personally petition the Yankees to return her silver, slaves and mules. With Bayard and Ringo, she sets off for Alabama and the Union army. They pass an army of freed slaves that is also seeking out the Yankees. On the way, they stop at Hawkhurst, where Bayard's Aunt Louisa lives. Ringo had been looking forward to seeing the railroad that runs nearby. But the railroad has been destroyed and the house burned. At Hawkhurst, Bayard's cousin Drusilla begs him to ask his father to let her join the regiment as a soldier. She accompanies them to the river crossing where the Yankees are encamped, and they are engulfed in a sea of restless slaves. The Northern troops dynamite the bridge over the river, and in the confusion the wagon falls into the water. The Yankees retrieve them, however, and are so overburdened with slaves that Colonel Dick issues Granny an order for more than 100 slaves and mules, as well as for several chests of silver. Granny dismisses most of the slaves, but she and Ringo use the order to get twelve extra horses from a Union encampment. The scam is quickly repeated, and after a year, Granny and Ringo have built a thriving trade in smuggled mules with the help of Ab Snopes, a poor local white. Ringo forges new orders and Granny uses them to requisition mules. Then, Ab sells the mules back to the clueless Yankees. They deliberate about a particularly risky opportunity and decide to go ahead, though Granny says she is uneasy. Her hesitation is justified: the Union army has issued a memo to be on the lookout for scams, and shortly after they leave camp the soldiers ride back to confront them. Granny has already given the mules to Ab for safekeeping, and when Ringo creates a diversion in the woods, Bayard and Granny simply vanish into the trees. Later that week, it becomes clear that Granny has not kept the profits for herself but has distributed them to keep other members of the community afloat. At Christmas 1864, Ab tells Granny about a group of bandits led by an ex- Confederate named Grumby who are terrorizing the countryside. Ab convinces Granny to try out her scam one last time on Grumby and his men. Though Bayard tearfully tries to dissuade her, she insists on going, and is shot and killed by Grumby. After the funeral, Bayard sets off to seek revenge, accompanied by Ringo and a friend of his father's, Uncle Buck. Realizing that Ab Snopes has joined Grumby's party, they track them for two months throughout the area. They know they are getting closer when a well-dressed stranger who turns out to be one of Grumby's men shoots at them, wounding Uncle Buck; the next day they find Ab Snopes tied up in the road as a kind of sacrifice. The cowardly Ab begs for mercy, and they decide not to kill him; instead, Uncle Buck carries him back to town. Bayard and Ringo continue their pursuit, and before long, Grumby's associates decide to hand him over to the boys to placate them. Grumby and Bayard wrestle. Bayard is almost trapped, but he prevails and kills Grumby. The boys nail his body to the door of the cotton compress where Granny was killed, then cut off his hand and attach it to Granny's grave marker. That spring, Drusilla has returned home from the war and is living in Jefferson with the Sartorises, dressing and acting mannish as she did while serving in the troops. Aunt Louisa is scandalized that Drusilla has been living with Colonel Sartoris and determines that they should marry. Aunt Louisa asks several respectable local women to take Drusilla in. The women cruelly offer sympathy for Drusilla's \\"condition,\\" reducing Drusilla to tears. Before long Louisa arrives and, ignoring her daughter's protests, makes plans for the wedding. However, she has planned the wedding for the same day as a hotly contested election in Jefferson, in which Colonel Sartoris is attempting to stop a carpetbagger victory in the town. The day of the wedding, Drusilla rides into town to get married but ends up helping Colonel Sartoris face off against the two carpetbaggers, whom he shoots and kills. When she learns what has happened, Aunt Louisa is furious that the wedding has not taken place. Drusilla, the colonel and the townspeople ride to the Sartoris plantation to resume the election; not surprisingly, the Republican candidate, an ex-slave, loses. Eight years later, Bayard is a law student at the University of Mississippi; once in the intervening years he has kissed Drusilla, who seems almost to be in love with him. One night Ringo rides to the university to tell him Colonel Sartoris has been killed by an ex-business partner and rival, Ben Redmond. Bayard will be expected to avenge his father and shoot Redmond. He rushes back to Jefferson, where Drusilla, in her yellow ball gown with a sprig of verbena in her hair, seems almost a priestess of revenge. She hands him a pair of dueling pistols, then breaks down in a hysterical fit of laughter. After Louvinia has led Drusilla to bed, Bayard's Aunt Jenny warns Bayard not to indulge in violence for its own sake. The next morning, Bayard rides into town with Ringo. A crowd gathers as he prepares to enter Redmond's office, but Bayard refuses offers of assistance from Ringo and of a pistol from a friend of his father's, George Wyatt. He enters Redmond's office; Redmond fires two shots at him, then takes his hat, walks across the square and boards a train out of Jefferson forever. The townspeople think Bayard has been killed; in fact, he has chosen to confront Redmond unarmed, breaking the cycle of violence without sacrificing his honor. When he returns home that evening, Drusilla has left for good. The only sign of her is a sprig of verbena she has left on his pillow.

It was unusual in using caseless ammunition. Although the effective range of the cannon was only 150 meters (490 ft), the Ho-301 was light and rapid-firing for its caliber. The caseless design revolved around a specially designed projectile, that was in effect a small rocket. The round used an internal propellant chamber at the rear of the projectile containing a ten gram silk bag filled with smokeless powder. Drilled into the base plate of the round are twelve 3.8 millimeter diameter exhaust holes. The propellant chamber is sealed by a thin aluminum sealing cup, which covers the exhaust holes. When the primer is struck, the bag of propellant ignites, and the pressure rises until the aluminum cup bursts, allowing the exhaust gas to rush through the exhaust holes pushing the projectile forward. The propellant was exhausted before the projectile left the barrel. Because of the low muzzle velocity (245 meters/second or about 804 ft/sec - equivalent to a moderately powerful air rifle)Williams & Gustin http://www.quarryhs.co.uk/WW2guneffect.htm the weapon was only suited to attacking bombers; even here the extremely low muzzle velocity made it difficult to achieve hits from any position besides directly astern the target aircraft and well within the range of defensive counterfire.

The western terminus of SR 246 is at a signalized intersection with U.S. Route 20 (US 20) in the Reynolds Corners neighborhood of Toledo. Its eastern terminus is at a signalized intersection with SR 51 in downtown Toledo. Created in the late 1920s, this state route is located entirely within the city limits of Toledo. All but the easternmost block of SR 246 is known as Dorr Street. Route description All of SR 246 is located within the city of Toledo in Lucas County. This highway is not included as a part of the National Highway System (NHS). The NHS is a network of highways that are vital to the economy, defense and mobility of the country. History The SR 246 designation was established in 1925. It was originally routed along the portion of its present alignment between Secor Road at the southwest corner of the University of Toledo campus, at the time a state- maintained roadway that carried the designation of SR 183, and its current eastern terminus in downtown Toledo. In 1934, SR 246 was extended from Secor Road to its present western terminus. Three years later, the highway was extended west out of Toledo via Dorr Road, Crissey Road and Frankfort Road to a new terminus at SR 295 south of Berkey. Then, in 1939, SR 246 was extended again on the west side, this time utilizing Frankfort Road west of SR 295 to Fulton-Lucas Road, then south to County Road L (CR L), which SR 246 then used heading west across the entire width of Fulton County, and into Williams County. Through Williams County, it followed what is now CR 20N and CR O to the SR 15 intersection, where it then used what is now the westernmost stretch of US 20A to get to a new western terminus at US 20 southwest of Pioneer. The 1937 and 1939 extensions of SR 246 were reversed by 1957, when the portions of the route west of US 20 in the western end of Toledo were removed from the state highway system.

However these have not been directly measured and additional observation, possibly over extended time periods, is needed. The eventual collision of the pair, which should stay apart for at least a few million more years, would result in strong gravitational waves.

Despite the family's residing in Germany through both World Wars, his paternal grandfather obtained British citizenship for himself and his children in November 1956 under the Sophia Naturalization Act 1705, and their family owned property and conducted business in the post-war United Kingdom. Until his mid-teens, Ernst August and his brother lived at Hurlingham Lodge in London. He also descends from Germany's last emperor, Wilhelm II, following whose abdication at the end of World War I the Hanovers also lost sovereignty over the Duchy of Brunswick, while retaining much of their continental personal property.

Already in 2004, his father had signed over to him the German property of the House of Hanover, including gothic-revival Marienburg Castle, the agricultural estates of Calenberg Castle and the F√ºrstenhaus (\\"Princely House\\") at Herrenhausen Gardens in Hanover; the elaborate museum in this small palace, built by King George I of Great Britain in 1720, has been closed to the public since 2011. Since 2004, the prince has taken over many representative tasks on behalf of his father. The father remained in charge of the Austrian family assets until 2013 when he was removed from the chairmanship of a family foundation based in Liechtenstein, the Duke of Cumberland Foundation, which holds the properties near Gmunden in Austria, the Hanovers' main residence in exile after 1866 when their Kingdom of Hanover was annexed by Prussia. Instead, the younger Ernst August was put in charge, reportedly for negligence on part of his father, at the initiative of the foundation's trustee Prince Michael of Liechtenstein.Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 22 Dec 2017 The foundation manages vast forests, \\"Cumberland Wildlife Park\\", the Queen's Villa, a hunting lodge and the mausoleum at Cumberland Castle.

Stating that its proceeds wouldn't suffice to maintain Marienburg Castle, infested with dry rot and threatened by static problems, he entered into negotiations with the State of Lower Saxony regarding the future of the castle, and its renovation, estimated at 27 million Euros. In November 2018 he announced that he planned to transfer the castle to a state-controlled foundation (the Hanoverian Monasteries' Chamber, founded by his family in 1569, which still owns most of the secularized monasteries and ecclesiastical estates of the former kingdom), at a symbolic sales price of 1 Euro, with the foundation undertaking renovation.Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung, 19 July 2016, p 1 The remaining art collection was planned to be kept in the castle, with parts purchased by the state, parts kept by the family and lent to the state, and parts transferred to a foundation controlled by both the family and the state.

Tor Books) The Return is a 2000 novel written by Buzz Aldrin and John Barnes. The book details a fictional account of the future of space travel, specifically space tourism. Although set in the near future, it now seems somewhat dated as events that happened shortly after its release, such as the Columbia disaster and recent space tourism advances such as SpaceShipOne and Virgin Galactic, are not included. Most of the corporations within the novel have fictional names; however, it is often quite clear that they are references to real corporations such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Nike. Overall, the book heavily supports the view that tourism is needed to drive the space industry.  Plot summary  The book starts by detailing a corporation that works to send people to space by booking them on empty seats on Space Shuttle flights. The third such flight is preparing to launch, carrying retired basketball player MJ (a character closely resembling Michael Jordan) into space. However, during the flight something goes wrong and MJ and a mission specialist die, while the rest of the crew is forced to make an emergency landing. Initially almost everyone in the space industry is sued over MJ's death, although most of the charges are later dropped when it is discovered that the explosion was the result of a Chinese attempt to take down the Space Shuttle. China is also found to be responsible for a high altitude nuclear weapon that Pakistan set off. The purpose of this bomb was to wipe out the current network of satellites, apparently in an attempt to cash in with their new presence in space exploration. The bomb also leaves the International Space Station heavily damaged. The rest of the book chronicles a daring rescue attempt to save those still on board the ISS, using mostly theoretical prototype vehicles. The rescue is a success, and the whole crew returns as heroes.

A figure of the American expatriate literary community in Paris during the 1920s, Wescott was openly gay.Eric Haralson, Henry James and Queer Modernity, Cambridge University Press, 2003, page 175 His relationship with longtime companion Monroe Wheeler lasted from 1919 until Wescott's death. Early life Wescott was born on a farm in Kewaskum, Wisconsin in 1901. His younger brother, Lloyd Wescott, was born in Wisconsin in 1907. He studied at the University of Chicago, where he was a member of a literary circle including Elizabeth Madox Roberts, Yvor Winters, and Janet Lewis. Independently wealthy, he began his writing career as a poet, but is best known for his short stories and novels, notably The Grandmothers (1927), which received the Harper Novel prize, and The Pilgrim Hawk (1940). Career Wescott lived in Germany (1921‚Äì22), and in France (c. 1925‚Äì33), where he mixed with Gertrude Stein and other members of the American expatriate community. Wescott was the model for the character Robert Prentiss in Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises. After meeting Prentiss, Hemingway's narrator, Jake Barnes, confesses, \\"I just thought perhaps I was going to throw up.\\" In the Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas (1933), Gertrude Stein wrote about him, \\"There was also Glenway Wescott but Glenway Wescott at no time interested Gertrude Stein. He has a certain syrup but it does not pour.\\" Wescott and Wheeler returned to the United States and maintained an apartment in Manhattan with photographer George Platt Lynes. When his brother Lloyd moved to a dairy farm in Union Township near Clinton in Hunterdon County, New Jersey in 1936, Wescott along with Wheeler and Lynes took over one of the farmhand houses and called it Stone-Blossom. His novel, The Pilgrim Hawk: A Love Story (1940), was praised by the critics. Apartment in Athens (1945), the story of a Greek couple in Nazi-occupied Athens who must share their living quarters with a German officer, was a popular success. From then on he ceased to write fiction, although he published essays and edited the works of others. In her essay on The Pilgrim Hawk Ingrid Norton writes, \\"After...Apartment in Athens, Wescott lived until 1987 without writing another novel: journals (published posthumously as Continual Lessons) and the occasional article, yes, but no more fiction. The Midwest-born author seems to slide into the golden handcuffs of expatriate decadence: supported by the heiress his brother married, surrounded by literate friends, given to social drinking and letter- writing.\\"http://www.openlettersmonthly.com/year-with-short-novels-love-the- limits-of-narrative-the-pilgrim-hawk/ On The Pilgrim Hawk, Open Letters Monthly by Ingrid Norton =Later life= In 1959, when his brother Lloyd acquired a farm near the village of Rosemont in Delaware Township, Hunterdon County, New Jersey, Wescott moved into a two-story stone house on the property, dubbed Haymeadows. In 1987, Wescott died of a stroke at his home in Rosemont and was buried in the small farmer's graveyard hidden behind a rock wall and trees at Haymeadows.

It is situated on the River Pitt in the South Somerset district midway between Wincanton, Bruton and Castle Cary. It is known for its dairy farming and one of the country's main centres of organic farming. History The first part of the name originates from Sheep Town. The second part comes from the family of Drew (Drogo) de Montagu, who held the manor under the count of Mortain, from the Norman invasion until 1421. The parish of Shepton Montague was part of the Norton Ferris Hundred. The manor was held from 1765 by the Phelps family of Montacute. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Wincanton Rural District. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of a county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.

Seen on photographic plates since at least 1887, it was first detected at radio wavelengths during the course of the Ohio Sky Survey. It is a supermassive black hole binary. The intrinsic brightness of the flashes corresponds to over a trillion times the Sun's luminosity, greater than the entire Milky Way galaxy's light output. Characteristics Its central supermassive black hole is among the largest known, with a mass of 18.35 billion solar masses, more than six times the value calculated for the previous largest object. Its Schwarzschild radius is ~362 AU, about 12 and 0.75 times the semimajor axes of the orbits of Neptune and dwarf planet Sedna, respectively. Black Hole Disk Flares In Galaxy OJ 287 (1:22; animation; 28 April 2020) The optical light curve shows that OJ 287 has a periodic variation of 11‚Äì12 years with a narrow double peak at maximum brightness. This kind of variation suggests that it is a binary supermassive black hole. The double-burst variability is thought to result from the smaller black hole punching through the accretion disc of the larger black hole twice in every 12 years. The smaller supermassive black hole with a mass of \\"only\\" 150 million orbits the larger one with an observed orbital period of ~12 years and a calculated eccentricity of ~0.65. The maximum brightness is obtained when the minor component moves through the accretion disk of the supermassive component at perinigricon. The perinigricon and aponigricon of its orbit are ~3,250 and ~17,500 AU, or about 9 and 48 times the primary's Schwarzschild radius; the latter is also ~0.275 light-year and ~0.085 parsec. The mass was calculated in 2008 by a team led by Mauri Valtonen of Tuorla Observatory in Finland. The timing of these outbursts allows the precession of the companion's elliptical orbit to be measured (39¬∞ per orbit), which allows the mass of the central black hole to be calculated using Einstein's principles of general relativity (see Kepler problem in general relativity). The timings also provide a test of the black hole no-hair theorem, which so far is consistent with the results. In order to reproduce all the known outbursts, the rotation of the primary black hole has to be 38% of the maximum allowed rotation for a Kerr black hole. The companion's orbit is decaying via the emission of gravitational radiation and it is expected to merge with the central black hole within approximately 10,000 years..

Biography He was born in Southampton, England, on 1 May 1846, the son of Captain William Henry Tregear,Williams, R. W. (1981) Tregears Around The World a descendant of an old Cornish family. Tregear was educated in private schools and trained as a civil engineer. He arrived in Auckland in June 1863 and took a position as a surveyor. This work brought him into close contact with the MƒÅori, and he began to study their language and culture. Poverty forced Tregear to enlist in the Auckland Engineer Volunteers. He saw action against the MƒÅori in the Tauranga area and was awarded the New Zealand War Medal. Between 1869 and 1873 he worked as a surveyor on the goldfields at Thames and Coromandel and on MƒÅori lands near Tokoroa. His investments in gold mining and saw milling ventures proved disastrous, and he lost what little money he had, setting a pattern for the rest of his life in financial matters. In 1877 he moved to Patea, working privately until 1881 as a surveyor for roads boards. He also captained the Patea Rifle Volunteers. His research on comparative mythology and linguistics was expressed in a controversial book The Aryan Maori (1885), in which he placed the MƒÅori language in the ranks of the Indo-European language family and further claimed that the MƒÅori shared an Aryan origin with the European. While this 'Aryan MƒÅori' theory was bitterly criticised in New Zealand it received favourable attention overseas. Tregear frequently contributed articles on MƒÅori anthropology to scholarly British journals, received fellowships of the Royal Geographical Society and the Royal Historical Society. Following on the heels of these fellowships, in 1893 he received a silver medal and an offer of a fellowship from the Society of Science, Letters and Art, which he refused. His refusal triggered an expos√© in New Zealand of this bogus institution.Evening Post, New Zealand, Volume XLV, Issue 132, 7 June 1893, p.2: A bogus literary society Retrieved 6 February 2014 Tregear was to repeat and refine his theory of the Aryan origin of MƒÅori in many works during the succeeding two decades. A freethinking socialist, Tregear was a personal friend of the politicians Ballance and Reeves. When the Liberal Party took office in 1891, he was named head of the new Bureau of Industries, later known as the Department of Labour. Working closely with Reeves as Minister, Tregear was responsible for the huge amount of progressive labour legislation passed in the 1890s. He was editor of the Journal of the Department of Labour. In 1891 Tregear published the Maori-Polynesian Comparative Dictionary which is regarded as his most important contribution to scholarship. In 1892 he co-founded the Polynesian Society with Percy Smith, with whom he co-edited the journal of the society. The French Government took official cognisance of the great amount of work devoted to the dialects of the Pacific Islands under the control of France, and he received the high honour of Officier of the Ordre des Palmes Acad√©miques. (1934): \\"Famous New Zealanders, No. 13, Edward Tregear ‚Äì Pioneer, Scholar, Humanitarian\\": The New Zealand Railways Magazine; Volume 9, Issue 1 (2 April 1934). He completed a substantial work, The Maori Race in 1904. Following his retirement as Secretary of Labour in 1910, he was honoured with the Imperial Service Order. Tregear never stood for Parliament, despite Ballance's urgings. In a 1912 by- election, he was elected to the Wellington City Council (re-elected 1913) and became president of the militant Social Democratic Party. However, in 1914, afflicted with failing eyesight and gravely troubled and disheartened by the failure of the waterfront strike, Tregear suddenly resigned all his offices. He retired to Picton in the South Island where he died on 28 October 1931. He was survived by his wife Bessie and their only daughter Vera. Contribution Tregear is regarded as an architect of the advanced social reforms which drew the world's attention to New Zealand. He was a prolific writer in a range of disparate genres including poetry, satire, and children's fairy stories, besides anthropology and sociology. While his theory of an Aryan origin of the MƒÅori has been soundly rejected, his linguistic work has proven to be more durable. \\"Tregear was among the country's most prominent, prolific and controversial intellectuals. Besides Polynesian studies, he produced journal and newspaper articles and public lectures on religion, philology, mythology, literature, science, economics, women, philosophy, ancient history, politics ‚Äì indeed almost the entire spectrum of human history and experience\\" (Howe 2006). Mount Tregear in the Southern Alps is named after him in close proximity to peaks named after other Liberal Party figures Notman, Ballance and Stout. Tregear's documentation of Moriori Census on the Chathams Islands as of 1889 is essential even today for the preservation of this unique culture: [Read before the Wellington Philosophical Society, 4 December 1889.] on the Moriori of the Chathams Islands: By Edward Tregear, F.R.G.S. \\"Thinking that, as the Moriori are rapidly dying out, scientists at the end of the next half-century might be interested in knowing what was the exact state of the native population in 1889, I made a census-inquiry, with the following result:‚Äî Chatham Islands, 23rd September, 1889.

Early life  Dema√ßi studied literature, law, and education in Pristina, Belgrade, and Skopje respectively. In the 1950s, he published a number of short stories with pointed social commentary in the magazine Jeta e re (English: New Life), as well as a 1958 novel titled Gjarpijt e gjakut (English: The Snakes of Blood) exploring blood vendettas in Kosovo and Albania. The latter work brought him literary fame. In 1963 he founded the underground organisation the Revolutionary Movement for the Union of Albanians. Dema√ßi was first arrested for his opposition to the authoritarian government of Josip Broz Tito in 1958, serving three years in prison. He was again imprisoned 1964‚Äì1974 and 1975‚Äì1990. He was released from prison by new president of Serbia Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá. In 2010 he received the order Hero of Kosovo.http://www.voal- online.ch/index.php?mod=article&cat;=LAJMIIF&article;=10410  Political career  After his release, he was Chairman of the Council for the Defense of Human Rights and Freedoms of the People of Kosovo from 1991 to 1995. He also served as editor-in-chief of Z√´ri, a magazine based in Prishtina, from 1991 to 1993. In 1991, he was awarded the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. In 1996, Dema√ßi moved into politics, replacing Bajram Kosumi as the president of the Parliamentary Party of Kosovo; Kosumi became his vice-president. During this time, he proposed a confederation of states consisting of Kosovo, Montenegro, and Serbia that would be known as \\"Balkania\\". His prison record gave him credibility among Kosovars, but his tenure in party leadership was marked by factionalism and a lack of action. Two years later, he joined the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), serving as the head of its political wing. In a 1998 interview with The New York Times, he refused to condemn the KLA's use of violence, stating that \\"the path of nonviolence has gotten us nowhere. People who live under this kind of repression have the right to resist.\\" In 1999, he resigned from the KLA after it attended peace talks in France, criticising the proposed deal for not guaranteeing Kosovo's independence. Sources stated that Dema√ßi had grown estranged from the KLA's younger, more pragmatic leadership, leaving him \\"faced with a decision of jumping or waiting to be pushed\\". Though Dema√ßi's wife left Kosovo before the war, he remained in Pristina with his 70-year-old sister during the entire Kosovo War. He was critical of Ibrahim Rugova and other Albanian leaders who fled the conflict, stating that they were missing an important historical event. Yugoslav soldiers arrested Dema√ßi twice, but were largely humane with him. Following the war, Dema√ßi served as director of Kosovo Radio and Television until January 2004.

The soft colorless solid with a pungent odor was known to the alchemists as butter of antimony. Preparation Antimony trichloride is prepared by reaction of chlorine with antimony, antimony tribromide, antimony trioxide, or antimony trisulfide. It also may be made by treating antimony trioxide with concentrated hydrochloric acid. Reactions Antimony trichloride solution in hydrochloric acid SbCl3 is readily hydrolysed and samples of SbCl3 must be protected from moisture. With a limited amount of water it forms antimony oxychloride releasing hydrogen chloride: :SbCl3 \\\\+ H2O ‚Üí SbOCl + 2 HCl With more water it forms Sb4O5Cl2 which on heating to 460¬∞ under argon converts to Sb8O11Cl12. SbCl3 readily forms complexes with halides, but the stoichiometries are not a good guide to the composition, for example the (C5H5NH)SbCl4 contains a chain anion with distorted SbIII octahedra. Similarly the salt (C4H9NH3)2SbCl5 contains a polymeric anion of composition [SbCl52‚àí]n with distorted octahedral SbIII.Zarychta, B.; Zaleski, J. \\"Phase transitions mechanism and distortion of SbCl63‚àí octahedra in bis(n-butylammonium) pentachloroantimonate(III) (C4H9NH3)2[SbCl5]\\".

Bruce King Encyclopedia of Inorganic Chemistry Editor R Bruce King (1994) John Wiley and Sons SbCl3 is only a weak Lewis base, however some complexes are known for example the carbonyl complexes, Fe(CO)3(SbCl3)2 and Ni(CO)3SbCl3. Structure In the gas phase SbCl3 is pyramidal with a Cl-Sb-Cl angle of 97.2¬∞ and a bond length of 233 pm. Wells A.F. (1984) Structural Inorganic Chemistry 5th edition, pp. 879 - 884, Oxford Science Publications, In SbCl3 each Sb has three Cl atoms at 234 pm showing the persistence of the molecular SbCl3 unit, however there are a further five neighboring Cl atoms, two at 346 pm, one at 361 pm, and two at 374 pm. These eight atoms can be considered as forming a bicapped trigonal prism. These distances can be contrasted with BiCl3 which has three near neighbors at 250 pm, with two at 324 pm, and three at a mean of 336 pm. The point to note here is that the all eight close neighbours of Bi are closer than the eight closest neighbours of Sb, demonstrating the tendency for Bi to adopt higher coordination numbers. Uses SbCl3 is a reagent for detecting vitamin A and related carotenoids in the Carr-Price test. The antimony trichloride reacts with the carotenoid to form a blue complex that can be measured by colorimetry. Antimony trichloride has also been used as an adulterant to enhance the louche effect in absinthe. It has been used in the past to dissolve and remove horn stubs from calves without having to cut them off. It is also used as a catalyst for polymerization, hydrocracking, and chlorination reactions; as a mordant; and in the production of other antimony salts. Its solution is used as an analytical reagent for chloral, aromatics, and vitamin A.Patnaik, P. Handbook of Inorganic Chemicals. McGraw-Hill, 2002, . It has a very potential use as a Lewis acid catalyst in synthetic organic transformation. A solution of antimony trichloride in liquid hydrogen sulfide is a good conductor, though the applications of such are limited by the very low temperature or high pressure required for hydrogen sulfide to be liquid. References in popular culture In episode 12 of the third season of the popular British program All Creatures Great and Small (adapted from chapter six of the book All Things Wise and Wonderful), several calves died following an episode of nonspecific gastroenteritis, the cause of which was later determined to be ingestion of antimony trichloride present in a solution used to dissolve their horn stubs.

It is located at the end of a railway line from Budapest.  History  Lajosmizse is situated at the meeting point of north-south and east-west routes. Once the area was covered with groves, then with wind-blown sand. The town stretches over a large area, and is still considered to be a settlement with many outlying parts. People lived here as early as the Bronze Age, and after the Magyar conquest the area became the dwelling place of the chief's clan. Later it was a Crown possession, so that the inhabitants could freely graze their livestock on the king's pastures. Around 1246, King B√©la IV resettled Cumans whom he called back from Bulgaria, in this area destroyed during the Mongol invasion. Later, in 1596 during Turkish times, the Tartar hordes devastated the land, during the 15-year war, and the wasteland was leased by the inhabitants of Kecskem√©t, Nagyk≈ër√∂s and J√°szber√©ny for grazing. In 1702 the monarch sold the area to the Teutonic Knights, but the dwellers took joint action and redeemed the lands which had previously been obtained by the Invalides from Pest. This is the origin of the locals' pride in the act of redemption. The blue in the coat of arms is the colour of transcendence, and signifies that the mediaeval settlement of Mizse already had a stone church, where Franciscan friars were also engaged in converting the reluctant Cumans to Christianity. As soon as the settlement gained independence, its Catholic church was completed by 1896 and, by 1903 the Calvinist church had also been built. The only remaining ruins of the one-time puszta churches are still to be seen here. Ruin of Church The green in the coat of arms recalls the former grovy pastures, on which in the period of the Magyar conquest, and in the Cuman and Turkish times, the breeding of sheep and cattle was dominant; there were also horse herds. As long as 1876, J√°sz-Lajos-Mizse was considered as the undivided pasture of the town of J√°szber√©ny. Having gained the rank of municipality in 1876, the settlement began to grow, but on the outer fields the isolated farmsteads kept on flourishing. The forced organization of co-operative farms in the 1950s brought about changes, but in the new political circumstances in 1989, there were nearly 4000 privately owned farms. The settlement's industry used to be based on agricultural production (mills, oil presses, etc.), but in the past fifty years various kinds of metallurgical, timber, light, domestic, printing, chemical and meat industry have also appeared. The two combatant lions record that the town once consisted of two settlements. Mizse may have been named after the palatine of King L√°szl√≥ IV (the Cuman). In the 14th century, one of the two Cuman headquarters called Mizsesz√©k was established here, performing both military and administrative functions. By the end of the 15th century, the feudalisation of the Cumans had shown remarkable progress. There were (mostly unsuccessful) attempts to deprive them of their privileges. The Turkish tax collectors still referred to both Mizse and Lajos as inhabited areas, but they were depopulated after 1596. In nearby Bene-puszta, the grave of a horseman from the time of the Magyar conquest was unearthed and scientifically documented. The findings are believed to be \\"the remains of the warrior Bene and the ornaments of his garment\\". The Jazygian horn, held by the lions, decorated seals as early as the 16th century, serving as the symbol of the Jazygians. It was even related to the well-known legend of the chief Lehel, which is based on two factors. One is that the horn is an artefact from the 9th‚Äì10th centuries. The other is that the edge is chipped. This damage may have happened when Lehel struck the German emperor dead. The historical validity of the story is disputed, but its credibility as a legend has remained intact in local tradition. The horn is a symbol of the inhabitants' ethnic coherence, independence and desire for freedom. The two stars refer to the two main denominations, the Roman Catholics and the Calvinists. It may again be related to one-time valour and tradition that the town's Catholic church was offered to be patronised by Saint Louis IX of France, the holy knight king, commander of the 7th and 8th crusader armies. It cannot be excluded either that the 14th century church was already consecrated to his honour, and the nearby place of dwelling (descensus) was named Lajos from that. Lajosmizse gained its current name in 1902, and in 1970 the settlement was given back the rank of municipality. In 1993, the President of the Republic of Hungary raised it to the rank of town. The crest is a memento of the victims and heroes of the past millennium and of the world wars (World War I and World War II), while the crown is the expressive symbol of independence and local autonomy.

Its extensive catalog of titles includes books on Jewish law, Torah, Talmud, Jewish lifestyle, Shabbat and Jewish holidays, Jewish history, biography, and kosher cookbooks. It also publishes children's books. The company's headquarters is located in New York, with publishing and sales divisions in Jerusalem. Its president is Yitzchak Feldheim. History Feldheim Publishers was founded in 1939 by Philipp Feldheim, a Viennese Jew who escaped Nazi Austria that year. He made his home in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, NYC where he was a founder of the Vienner Kehilla there.

Feldheim opened a small bookshop on the Lower East Side, and witnessing customer demand for Jewish literature, decided to go into Jewish publishing under the name Philipp Feldheim Inc. Feldheim Publishers was the first to produce Torah books with professional graphics. It also pioneered the publication of biographies of modern-day Orthodox Jewish figures such as Rabbi Aryeh Levin (A Tzaddik in Our Time) and Rabbi Yaakov Yosef Herman (All For the Boss). From the beginning, the company, which markets under the slogan ‚ÄúTorah Literature of Quality‚Äù, committed itself to publishing the classics of Torah literature. These included age-old classics such as Duties of the Heart (translation of Chovot ha-Levavot), The Path of the Just (translation of Mesillat Yesharim), The Way of God (translation of Derech Hashem), and The Kuzari: In Defense of the Despised Faith (by Rabbi Yehuda Halevi), along with modern works such as Strive for Truth (translation of Michtav MiEliyahu by Rabbi Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler), Shemirath Shabbath KiHilchatho (by Rabbi Yehoshua Neuwirth), and Book of Our Heritage (translation of Sefer HaToda‚Äôah by Rabbi Eliyahu Kitov, translated by Rabbi Nachman Bulman).

It leaves US 20 in Hamburg, a suburb of Buffalo, and rejoins it in East Bloomfield about five miles (8 km) west of Canandaigua, the county seat of Ontario County. The western terminus is situated just northeast of the intersection of US 20 and US 62 and west of New Era Field. At its east end, US 20A also meets New York State Route 5 (NY 5) and NY 64\\\\. Most of the route is known as Big Tree Road; outside New Era Field, the highway is known as the Timothy J. Russert Highway in memory of Buffalo native Tim Russert. While the main line of US 20 takes a direct path between Hamburg, Buffalo, and East Bloomfield via Avon, US 20A veers to the south to serve several villages and hamlets, including the villages of Geneseo and Warsaw. The town of Attica, famous for the Attica Prison riots of 1971, lies between US 20 and US 20A. As the route heads east, US 20A connects to several north‚Äìsouth freeways, such as NY 400 outside of East Aurora and Interstate 390 (I-390) between Geneseo and Lakeville. Outside of the communities that dot the highway, US 20A is a two-lane, rural highway. The highway carried several designations prior to becoming US 20A . In the mid-1920s, the section of modern US 20A from East Aurora to Lakeville was part of New York State Route 35\\\\. US 20 was first signed in New York in 1927, occupying the piece of NY 35 between East Aurora and Geneseo and all of what is now US 20A west of East Aurora upon assignment. It was altered to also use the Geneseo‚ÄìLakeville section of former NY 35 in the early 1930s. At the time, the section of current US 20A between US 20 and Bristol was designated as New York State Route 254\\\\. US 20 was realigned onto its current alignment between Hamburg and Avon , and US 20A was assigned to US 20's former routing west of Lakeville and all of NY 254 by the following year. Route description =Buffalo area= US 20A separates from US 20 just northeast of an intersection locally known as \\"Seven Corners\\" in the town of Hamburg. The route heads east through the Buffalo suburbs on Big Tree Road, entering the town of Orchard Park and passing south of the southern campus of the Erie Community College. At Abbott Road, US 20A becomes the \\"Timothy J. Russert Highway\\", named for Buffalo native Tim Russert. The route continues on, passing south of New Era Field before changing back to Big Tree Road at California Road. Not far to the east, US 20A meets US 219 (the Southern Expressway) at an interchange. Past US 219, the route enters the village of Orchard Park, becoming Quaker Street and intersecting the concurrent routes of NY 240 and NY 277 in the center of the community. Eastbound on US 20A in the village of Orchard Park Outside of the village, US 20A becomes Quaker Road, passing through slightly less developed areas as it progresses eastward. Midway between Orchard Park village and East Aurora, US 20A intersects the southern terminus of NY 187 (Transit Road) at the Orchard Park‚ÄìAurora town line. Transit Road, however, continues south for one mile (1.6 km) as County Route 553 (CR 553). Farther east, US 20A runs south of Cazenovia Creek for two miles (3 km) across open terrain prior to crossing the creek and entering the densely populated village of East Aurora. The route enters East Aurora on Hamburg Street, running parallel to a branch of Cazenovia Creek for a half- mile (0.8 km) to Buffalo Street. Here, US 20A meets the overlapping routes of NY 16 and NY 78 at a traffic circle in the village's primary business district. The three routes come together, becoming Main Street and passing by the Fillmore House as it proceeds through the center of the village. At Olean Street, one mile (1.6 km) east of the circle in East Aurora's central business district, NY 16 turns right, continuing south toward Pennsylvania. US 20A and NY 78 remain concurrent as they exit the village and meet NY 400 (the Aurora Expressway) on the eastern edge. =East Aurora to Warsaw= East of NY 400, US 20A and NY 78 become Big Tree Road once more as the highway leaves the Buffalo suburbs and passes through the rural eastern portion of Erie County. Near the Wales hamlet of Wales Center, NY 78 departs US 20A on Strykersville Road, ending the four mile (6 km) overlap. In Wales Center itself, US 20A intersects Four Rod Road, once designated as NY 358 and now part of CR 356\\\\. Past the hamlet, US 20A deviates from its linear east-west alignment, swerving to the south on a newer routing of Big Tree Road before reuniting with its original routing to the east. ahead, US 20A exits Erie County and enters the equally rural Wyoming County town of Sheldon. Sign on US 20A warning motorists of steep grades and sharp turns near Warsaw In Sheldon, US 20A intersects NY 77 near Sheldon Center and NY 98 in Varysburg, forming a concurrency with the latter into the adjacent town of Orangeville. Upon crossing the town line, the two routes split, with NY 98 proceeding southwest to Java. US 20A continues southeast from NY 98 on a linear alignment, intersecting the southern terminus of NY 238 at Halls Corner, a small hamlet located near the Orangeville‚ÄìWarsaw town line. Shortly after passing NY 238, US 20A makes a turn to the east as it enters Warsaw. Roughly from the town line, US 20A descends into the Oatka Valley, a large ravine containing Oatka Creek and the entirety of the village of Warsaw. Now named Buffalo Street, US 20A heads east‚Äìwest across the village, intersecting NY 19, one of two state routes to directly connect Lake Ontario with the Pennsylvania state line, at the center of Warsaw. Past the NY 19 junction, US 20A continues east along Buffalo Street to the eastern edge of the village and the valley, where the route turns a full 90 degrees to the north to climb the side of the Oatka Valley. The route ascends approximately , passing under the Rochester and Southern Railroad (RSR)‚Äîwhich runs along the foot of the gorge‚Äîbefore exiting the valley and returning to an east-west alignment as it heads toward Perry and points east. All oversize trucks are prohibited from using the section of US 20A between NY 19 and Minor Road at the top of the valley due to the steep grade of the hill and the sharp curve at the bottom. =Warsaw to Geneseo= Outside of the Oatka Valley, US 20A heads east through the remainder of the town of Warsaw prior to entering the town of Perry. The route serves Perry‚ÄìWarsaw Airport on its way to Perry Center, a small hamlet situated directly north of the village of Perry, where US 20A intersects NY 246\\\\. The portion of US 20A in Perry is otherwise uneventful, and the route quietly passes into the Livingston County town of Leicester later. After another of rural surroundings, US 20A meets NY 39 at a junction approximately southwest of the village of Leicester. The two routes converge, following Leicester Road northeast to the village, where the highway's name shifts to Main Street upon entering the village limits. US 20A and NY 39 in the town of Geneseo East of a grade crossing with the Genesee and Wyoming Railroad subdivision of the RSR, US 20A and NY 39 connect to NY 36 at York Road. NY 36 briefly overlaps with US 20A and NY 39 for one block before heading to the south via Mount Morris Road at the village center. US 20A and NY 39 continue on, leaving Leicester on as Cuylerville Road, named for the community located directly northeast of Leicester. The routes pass in and out of Cuylerville and head eastward into a wide valley, crossing Beards Creek and the Genesee River. At the eastern bank of the latter, the highway crosses into the town of Geneseo. On the other side of the Genesee River, US 20A and NY 39 rise in elevation once more as they head to the northeast, climbing the eastern edge of the gully to meet NY 63 at the valley's eastern edge. After a brief concurrency with US 20A and NY 39, NY 63 splits off to the west, running alongside the western edge of the nearby SUNY Geneseo campus. In contrast, US 20A and NY 39 form a portion of the eastern edge of the campus between NY 63 and Mary Jemison Drive in the village of Geneseo. At the latter intersection, US 20A and NY 39 turn east onto South Street. After just one block, the US 20A / NY 39 overlap comes to an end as NY 39 follows Main Street north out of Geneseo toward Avon. US 20A continues east through Geneseo before taking on a more northeasterly alignment outside of the village. At this point, the highway becomes Lakeville Road for the Conesus Lake community to the northeast. The route proceeds across open terrain to the western outskirts of Lakeville, where US 20A connects to I-390 at exit 8\\\\. Past the expressway, US 20A continues on a northeast alignment‚Äîalbeit more eastern than northern‚Äîas it intersects NY 256 and enters both the town of Livonia and the hamlet of Lakeville. =Finger Lakes= US 20A east and NY 15 south in Lakeville As Big Tree Road once more, US 20A acts as the major east-west thoroughfare for Lakeville, connecting the hamlet to I-390 in the west to the village of Livonia to the east. In the center of Lakeville, US 20A intersects the north‚Äìsouth NY 15\\\\. The two routes converge on Big Tree Road, following the roadway around the northern tip of Conesus Lake and southeastward through the rural landscape between Lakeville and Livonia. In Livonia, Big Tree Road continues to the southeast as Big Tree Street; however, US 20A and NY 15 leave Big Tree Road to follow Main Street instead. NY 15 remains on US 20A for one more block to the center of Livonia, at which point it continues southward on Commercial Street toward Conesus while US 20A heads east on Main Street and out of the village as Richmond Mills Road. For the next , US 20A loosely parallels Big Tree Road, located about to the south. At a rural junction known as Bosley Corner, US 20A merges with the north-south NY 15A and follows NY 15A south toward the hamlet of Hemlock. While concurrent with NY 15A, US 20A crosses Big Tree Road at the midpoint of the concurrency. The two routes proceed through Hemlock before splitting south of the community. Here, US 20A breaks from NY 15A and continues east on Honeoye Road into the Ontario County town of Richmond. About into the sparsely developed town, US 20A reconnects to Big Tree Road at Curtis Corner. The route, however, becomes Main Street for the hamlet of Honeoye a short distance to the east. US 20A runs east-west through the small yet highly developed community, crossing Honeoye Creek and passing north of Honeoye Lake. It leaves the hamlet soon after, turning to the northeast and traversing a series of small hills as it passes into the town of Bristol as Honeoye Road once again. Roughly from the town line, US 20A intersects NY 64 in the Bristol Valley. US 20A turns north onto NY 64, following the state route out of the valley and into the town of East Bloomfield, where US 20A ends later at an intersection with US 20 and NY 5\\\\. The section of US 20A that overlaps NY 64 was signed north-south, matching NY 64's direction, however, the US 20A north-south tabs were replaced by east- west tabs between 2010 and 2012, but still the north-south tabs are now for NY 64 shields only. NY 64 continues west from the junction on US 20 and NY 5. History =Origins and designation= In 1908, the New York State Legislature established a statewide legislative route system that initially consisted of 37 unsigned routes. The portion of what is now US 20A between Four Rod Road in Wales and NY 98 in Sheldon was included in Route 19, a highway that extended from Buffalo to Batavia. Two smaller segments of modern US 20A‚Äîthe sections concurrent to NY 16 in East Aurora and NY 64 in Ontario County‚Äîbecame part of Route 17 and Route 14, respectively. When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, the entirety of legislative Route 17 was designated as part of NY 16 while the portion of modern US 20A between Lakeville and Livonia became part of NY 4\\\\. By 1926, the section of what is now US 20A between NY 16 in East Aurora and NY 4 in Lakeville was designated as part of NY 35, which initially continued northwest to Buffalo by way of an overlap with NY 16 and followed NY 4 north from Lakeville to NY 5 in East Avon. Approaching NY 15A on US 20A westbound near Hemlock. Note the errant NY 20A shield. NY 35 was largely replaced by US 20 when U.S. Highways were first signed in New York in 1927. At the time, US 20 entered the Buffalo area on modern NY 5 and followed Big Tree Road and current US 20A east to East Aurora, where it overlapped NY 16 to reach the former routing of NY 35\\\\. From there, it continued east over former NY 35 to Geneseo before proceeding to Avon on modern NY 39\\\\. Meanwhile, NY 4 was renumbered to NY 2 to eliminate numerical duplication with the new US 4 in the Capital District. This edition shows U.S. Routes as they were first officially signed in 1927. The portion of former NY 35 between Geneseo and Lakeville went unnumbered until the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York when it became the westernmost portion of NY 254, an east‚Äìwest highway that initially extended eastward along modern US 20A and CR 32 to a junction with NY 21 west of Canandaigua.Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book, 1930‚Äì31 and 1931‚Äì32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931). The 1930‚Äì31 edition shows New York state routes prior to the 1930 renumbering NY 254 was truncated westward to NY 64 in Bristol by the following year. US 20 was realigned between Geneseo and East Avon to follow NY 254 east to Lakeville, where it turned north to follow NY 2 to East Avon. NY 254 was truncated to the east end of its former overlap with NY 2 in Livonia as a result while US 20's former routing between Geneseo and Avon became NY 20D. US 20 was altered again to follow its modern alignment between Hamburg and East Avon. Its former routing between Hamburg and Geneseo became part of the new NY 20A, which also continued north to Avon over NY 20D. The remainder of US 20's old routing between Geneseo and Lakeville became part of a reextended NY 254. US 20A was established by the following year, replacing NY 20A west of Geneseo and NY 254 from Geneseo to Bristol. The new highway also followed NY 64 northward to East Bloomfield in order to rejoin US 20 in the hamlet of South Bloomfield. NY 254 was reassigned to the Geneseo‚ÄìAvon portion of NY 20A; however, it was supplanted by an extended NY 39 . =Other developments= Timothy J. Russert Highway sign at US 20A and Abbott Road On the morning of March 12, 1994, a large section of the roof in the southern end of the Retsof Salt Mine collapsed. The collapsed portion of the mine was located near the hamlet of Cuylerville, located on US 20A just south of the mine. One day before the collapse, warning signs were erected at the bridge carrying US 20A over nearby Beards Creek due to the presence of bumps in the pavement along the bridge approaches. Over the next few weeks, two large sinkholes opened on the surface above the mine, one of them located just south of the US 20A bridge over Beards Creek. This sinkhole led to the collapse of a small area of US 20A east of the creek and the closure and, ultimately, collapse of the bridge over the creek. As a result, a detour was installed between Leicester and Geneseo. No construction was done on the area for a number of years while a court battle was fought over whether Retsof should reimburse the New York State Department of Transportation to fix the road. The road and new bridge were fixed and reopened in the late 1990s. On June 18, 2008, a bill seeking to rename the part of US 20A from Abbott Road to California Road as the \\"Timothy J. Russert Highway\\" was introduced in the United States Senate. The bill, sponsored by Senators Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton along with Representative Brian Higgins, was passed by both the House and the Senate and was signed into law by President George W. Bush on July 23, 2008. The designation is in memory of Buffalo native Tim Russert, the long-time host of NBC's Meet the Press who died on June 13, 2008., 110th Congress, 2nd Session.

After being captured, she died of complications of pneumonia. She was buried in Florence National Cemetery, the first woman soldier to be afforded that honor. Sometime after February 1864, she was captured and confined at the Confederacy's most notoriously brutal prisoner of war concentration camp, Andersonville shortly after it was created. Some reports state that her husband died at Andersonville by a prison guard. However, Budwin herself stated that her husband died in battle, after which she was captured. A soldier who saw her there (Samuel Elliott, 7th Penna. Reserves) described her as \\"a woman rather above the medium height, sunburnt, with long, unkempt hair. Her clothing consisted of a rough gray shirt, a pair of worn-out army trousers, and what was once a military cap.\\"\\"The Grave of a Heroine,\\" The Helena Independent June 24, 1890, page 3, column 1 She remained at Andersonville until it was threatened by Union forces, and was then transferred to the Florence Stockade in Florence, South Carolina in the fall. There, she attended to sick prisoners until she herself became ill with pneumonia in the winter; when Dr. Josephus Hall gave her medical attention, he discovered her sex, after which Budwin was given special treatment, including donations of food, clothing from local women, and her own room. However, she died shortly thereafter at the age of 20 on January 25, 1865, less than a month before sick Union prisoners of war were released by the Confederacy. Budwin's decision to keep her sex a secret during her prison time likely cost her life and her reasons for doing so are unknown. In fact, little is known about her military service except for her time in prison. Florena Budwin may not even have been her real name. An estimated 16,000 Union prisoners were held captive in the Florence Prison Stockade between September 1864 and February 1865. In that short period of time, 2,738 prisoners died from malnutrition and disease.National Cemetery AdministrationComfortable Camps The owner of a plantation adjacent to the prison allowed the dead to be buried in trenches on his property.

The medical school offers a full-time Doctor of Medicine degree program, multiple joint degree programs, graduate medical education, and continuing medical education. The mission of the Feinberg School of Medicine is to educate the next generation of physicians and scientists. Feinberg ranked 18th among American medical schools for research by U.S. News & World Report in 2020. It also is committed to patient care and community service. Through clinical affiliates Northwestern Memorial Hospital, the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago and the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab (formerly Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago), Feinberg faculty provide patient care to tens of thousands of individuals every year. Feinberg and its clinical affiliates are together a $5 billion academic medical enterprise. The school employs 4,000 faculty members. History Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine was founded as the medical department of Lind University on October 11, 1859. It was renamed the Chicago Medical College in 1863, and affiliated with Northwestern University in 1870. During this period, a medical school for women was also affiliated with Northwestern University. The Woman‚Äôs Medical College of Chicago, established in 1870 as the Woman‚Äôs Hospital Medical College, became affiliated with Northwestern in 1892 as Northwestern University Woman‚Äôs Medical School. The college closed in 1902 as other schools in Chicago and the nation began accepting women. In 1906, the Chicago Medical College was renamed Northwestern University Medical School. It had occupied buildings on the near south side of Chicago from 1863 until the Montgomery Ward Memorial Building was constructed in Streeterville in 1926. The Montgomery Ward Memorial building at the Feinberg School of Medicine Northwestern University Medical School was renamed the Feinberg School of Medicine in 2002, reflecting a $75 million donation from the Joseph and Bessie Feinberg Foundation. Reuben Feinberg started to donate to the university after being hospitalized at Northwestern Memorial Hospital for a heart attack. The first donation, in 1988, was for $17 million to establish the Feinberg Cardiovascular Research Institute. A $10 million donation was subsequently sent in 1996 to establish the Frances Evelyn Feinberg Clinical Neurosciences Institute. On September 1, 2013, Northwestern Medical Faculty Foundation, the medical school's physician's group, joined Northwestern Memorial HealthCare (NMHC), the health system that includes Northwestern Memorial Hospital, forming a new physician's group called Northwestern Medical Group. Together, NMHC and Feinberg jointly share the brand \\"Northwestern Medicine.\\" On May 8, 2015, exactly 90 years after Northwestern University first broke ground on its Chicago campus, Feinberg broke ground on the Louis A. Simpson and Kimberly K. Querrey Biomedical Research Center. The building opened in June 2019 and added more than 625,000 square feet and 12 stories of research space to the downtown campus. Academic Medical Center The Feinberg School of Medicine is part of the McGaw Medical Center of Northwestern University. Other McGaw members include: * Anne & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago * Northwestern Memorial Hospital * Shirley Ryan AbilityLab (formerly Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago) * Jesse Brown VA Medical Center (formerly VA Chicago Health Care System) Feinberg medical students and McGaw residents receive their clinical training at these hospitals, where nearly all the attending staff members have faculty appointments at the Feinberg School of Medicine. Residents also train at affiliates such as John H. Stroger Jr Hospital of Cook County, Northwestern Medicine Lake Forest Hospital, Swedish Covenant Hospital, MacNeal Hospital, and Methodist Hospital in Gary, Indiana. The medical school's primary teaching hospital is Northwestern Memorial Hospital, a modern hospital that was completed in 1999. In the 2020 US News and World Report list of \\"Honor Roll\\" Hospitals, listing the top 10 medical centers in the United States, Northwestern Memorial Hospital is ranked 10th, and first in Illinois, and the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab was ranked first in the country for rehabilitation. Education The Feinberg School of Medicine is home to 657 medical students. The class of students who graduated in 2020 are the 161stth graduating class. For the 2020 entering class, 7,052 people applied for 160 seats. The median undergraduate GPA and MCAT score for successful applicants are 3.9 and 519, respectively. In 2012, Feinberg's entering medical students began a new curriculum, organized into three phases and emphasizing integration of four main curricular elements: science in medicine, clinical medicine, health & society, and professional development. The goal of the renewal process is to build a more learner-centered educational program that (1) fully integrates scientific principles in a clinical context; (2) stimulates inquiry and investigation; (3) has an assessment system that comprehensively evaluates student achievement in each of the core competencies; (4) reinforces a culture of learning, teamwork, and excellence; (5) is flexible and able to meet the unique needs of individual students as they learn and differentiate. For medical students, the school offers four-year dual degree programs, which combine the Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree with a Master of Public Health (MPH), a Master of Arts in Medical Humanities and Bioethics (MA), a Master of Science in Healthcare Quality and Patient Safety (MS), or a Master of Business Administration (MBA). Students electing to pursue the additional degrees enroll in evening classes and graduate with both degrees. Two MD/PhD programs are offered, one in combination with Northwestern University's Graduate School (Medical Scientist Training Program) and one with the University's Institute for Neuroscience. The school also offers graduate degree programs, some in combination with other Northwestern University professional schools: *Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in basic science programs such as Biological Sciences and Clinical Psychology, and public health programs such as Health and Biomedical Informatics, Health Services and Outcomes Research, Epidemiology, and Translational Outcomes Science *Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) *Master of Medical Science (MMSc) in Physician Assistant Studies *Master of Public Health (MPH) *Master of Science (MS) in programs such as Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Clinical Investigation, Genetic Counseling, Regulatory Compliance, or Healthcare Quality and Patient Safety *Master of Medical Informatics (MMI) *Master of Prosthetics and Orthotics (MPO) Additionally, the school offers a BS/MD degree through the Honors Program in Medical Education (HPME), a seven-year combined undergraduate and medical school program. Research According to public financial data for Feinberg, support for competitive research grants from all external sources totaled $643 million in academic year 2019-2020. In 2018, Feinberg ranked 15th for NIH funding among American medical schools. The medical school houses more than 30 Core Facilities, including a Bioinformatics Consulting Core, Genomics Core and Human Embryonic and Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Core. Faculty in the Research program at Feinberg study and mentor in a range of areas, including cancer biology, cell biology, chemical biology, drug discovery, developmental biology, evolutionary biology, genetics, genomics, medical biology, immunology, microbial pathogenesis, neurobiology, pharmacology, structural biology, biochemistry, epigenetics, epidemiology, behavioral sciences, preventive medicine, epidemiology, health outcomes, quality improvement, and translational sciences. Recent Growth In June 2019, the University opened a $560 million, 625,000 square-foot biomedical research building on the Chicago campus. The new building, the Louis A. Simpson and Kimberly K. Querrey Biomedical Research Center, is connected to the existing Robert H. Lurie Medical Research Center. A second phase of build out will eventually total 1.2 million square feet in the new building when complete. Additionally, more than 250,000 square feet of space in existing campus buildings has been converted to new laboratory space.

It stars Scott Speedman, James Marsden, and Sof√≠a Vergara. Plot Tom (Scott Speedman) and Dan (James Marsden) meet in a bar and then proceed to Tom's apartment together. While there, Dan realizes that he had been in that same apartment before. Five years earlier, Dan and Tom had a one night stand there. According to Tom, that encounter with Dan was his first and only homosexual experience. Some years later, Tom's wife is found to be HIV positive. Despondent after receiving this diagnosis from her doctor, she drives through a red traffic light and is killed in an ensuing collision. Subsequent to these events, medical tests reveal that Tom is also HIV positive. Tom blames himself for passing HIV on to his wife and, in turn, he blames Dan for passing the virus on to him. Reasoning that Dan, ultimately, is to blame for his wife's death, Tom devises a plan to exact revenge. He holds Dan hostage, keeping him bound and gagged to a chair in his apartment. He draws blood from Dan in order to conduct a test to determine Dan's HIV status. If Dan's test results are positive for HIV, Tom vows to kill Dan. If the results are negative, Tom agrees to release Dan unharmed. In the end, Tom returns to the apartment and lets Dan go. As Dan is leaving, Tom asks him when he had last been tested. A few moments later, he reveals that Dan's test was, in fact, positive. He decided to let Dan go because he realized that his positive status was the result of his choices which he couldn't blame on anyone else.

The career and technical academies are: Academy for Arts, Sciences and Technology; Palmetto Academy for Learning Motor Sports, and the Academy for Technology and Academics. The Palmetto Academy for Learning Motor Sports (a charter school) serves middle and high school students while the remaining two serve high school students. The Scholars Academy serves high-achieving students in grades 9-12. The HCS Early College High School targets students in grades 9-12 who are under-represented in post-secondary education, and allows them to achieve two years of college credit while also earning a high school diploma. The district also has the Playcard Environmental Education Center which \\"instruct[s] students in the natural sciences on site, enabling them to experience first-hand the inter-relationships of living things.\\" The Adult Education Center has a variety of educational opportunities for adults. These range from GED classes to career and college transition, community classes, English as Second Language classes, and community classes. The community classes are: computer literacy classes, arts & crafts classes, Spanish, CPR/AED certification, and Tai Chi for arthritis/health. The Adult Education Center also provides free child care and early education for children of parents attending classes at the Adult Education Center. In addition to these programs, students from seventh grade up may also take classes via either the HCS Virtual School Program or the South Carolina Virtual School Program. A twelve-member Board of Education, elected from single-member districts, governs the school district, with the chairman being elected at-large. The Superintendent is appointed by the Board. Board meetings are generally held on the last Monday of the month and work sessions held on the 2nd Monday of the month though the district calendar contains an accurate listing of all board meetings. Normal board meetings are open to the public and agendas, minutes, and video of the meetings are available through the school district's website. The HCS Mobile app was introduced in 2018. The app is available for iOS and Android operating systems and as a web/html5 based app. Schools = Base high schools and high school options = * Academy for Arts, Science & Technology * Academy for Technology & Academics * Aynor High School * Carolina Forest High School * Conway High School * Early College High School * Green Sea Floyds High School * Loris High School * Myrtle Beach High School * North Myrtle Beach High School * Scholars Academy * Socastee High School * St. James High School =Middle schools= *Aynor Middle School *Black Water Middle School *Conway Middle School *Forestbrook Middle School *Green Sea Floyds Middle School *Loris Middle School *Myrtle Beach Middle School *North Myrtle Beach Middle School *Ocean Bay Middle School *Socastee Middle School *St. James Middle School *Ten Oaks Middle School *Whittemore Park Middle School =Elementary schools= *Elementary School *Burgess Elementary School *Carolina Forest Elementary School *Conway Elementary School *Daisy Elementary School *Forestbrook Elementary School *Green Sea Floyds Elementary School *Homewood Elementary School *Kingston Elementary School *Lakewood Elementary School *Loris Elementary School *Midland Elementary School *Myrtle Beach Elementary School *Myrtle Beach Early Childhood School *Myrtle Beach Primary School *Ocean Bay Elementary School *Ocean Drive Elementary School *Palmetto Bays Elementary School *Pee Dee Elementary School *River Oaks Elementary School *Riverside Elementary School *Seaside Elementary School *Socastee Elementary School *South Conway Elementary School *St. James Elementary School *St. James Intermediate School *Waccamaw Elementary School *Waterway Elementary School = Program Schools = * Horry County Adult Education * Horry County Education Center * Therapeutic Learning Center = Charter schools = * Bridgewater Academy * Palmetto Academy * Academy of Hope * Palmetto Academy for Learning Motor Sports References External links * Horry County Schools Official Site Education in Horry County, South Carolina ","title":"Horry County Schools"},{"id":"5024894","text":"The Willamette Falls Locks are a lock system on the Willamette River in the U.S. state of Oregon. Opened in 1873 and closed since 2011, they allowed boat traffic on the Willamette to navigate beyond Willamette Falls and the T.W. Sullivan Dam. Since their closure in 2011 the locks are classified to be in a \\"non-operational status\\" and are expected to remain permanently closed. Located in the Portland metropolitan area, the four inter-connected locks are 25 miles upriver from the Columbia River at West Linn, just across the Willamette River from Oregon City. The locks were operated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers and served primarily pleasure boats. Passage through the locks was free for both commercial and recreational vessels. The locks were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The locks comprise seven gates in four chambers which lift up to elevation change (depending on tides and river flow) with a usable width of . The system is long, and can accommodate vessels up to long. Each of the four concrete constructed chambers are . Preparations for construction Bernard Goldsmith, mayor of Portland 1869‚Äì1871 and a principal backer of the Willamette Falls Canal and Locks project. The canal and locks were built from 1870 to 1872. Much legal, organizational, and financial work had to be done before construction could begin. The Willamette Falls Canal and Locks Company (later renamed Portland General Electric) was formed in 1868 to build a navigation route around the falls. This company was incorporated by a special act of the legislature. At that time, all transshipment of freight across the Willamette Falls was controlled by the People's Transportation Company, often referred to as the P.T. Co. Ownership of this key point in the river gave the P.T. Co. the ability to quell all competition for shipping on the Willamette River. The canal and locks were built in part to break the market domination of the P.T. Co. over riverine transport on the Willamette. =Incorporation of canal and locks company= The Wallamet Falls Canal and Locks Company, with authorized capital of $300,000, was incorporated on September 14, 1868 by N. Haun, Samuel L. Stephens, of Clackamas County, and experienced steamboat captain Ephraim W. Baughman (1835‚Äì1921) to \\"locate and construct a canal and suitable boat locks at the falls of the Willamette River, on the west side of said falls\\". =Government subsidy= On October 26, 1868, the Oregon legislature approved a law entitled \\"an Act to appropriate funds for the construction of a Steamboat Canal at Wallamet Falls.\\" The law stated it was \\"of great importance to the people of Oregon\\" that a canal and locks be built on the west side of Willamette Falls and that the rates for carriage of freight on the Willamette River be reduced by this construction\\", and so it granted the company a subsidy of $150,000, to be paid in six annual installments of $25,000, starting on the date the canal and looks were completed, with the money to come from lands donated to the state of Oregon by the United States for internal improvement. As condition precedent to receipt of the funds, by January 1, 1871, the company was to expend at least $100,000 and complete construction, on the west side of the falls, a functioning canal, \\"constructed chiefly of cut stone, cement and iron, and otherwise built in a durable and permanent manner\\" with locks not less than long and wide.\\" Upon completion, a commission appointed by the governor was to inspect the works to determine if they were constructed in compliance with the law, and if not, no subsidy would be paid. =Toll authority= The company could charge tolls, for the first ten years after completion, of no more than seventy-five cents per ton for all freight, and twenty cents per passenger. After ten years, maximum tolls would fall to fifty cents per ton of freight and ten cents per passenger. Twenty years after completion, the State of Oregon would have an option to buy canal at its actual value. The company was also required to pay 10% of the net profit from tolls to the state for the first ten years, and 5% thereafter. =Investors sought= In early 1869, the company sought investors by publishing a prospectus, which among other claims, predicted that 60,000 tons of freight and 20,000 passengers would pass through the canal and locks every year, which turned out to be an overstatement by a factor of several hundred percent. The company was also reported to have sent an agent east to negotiate financing. =Condemnation actions= In March 1869, the company's attorney, Septimus Huelat, brought condemnation actions in Clackamas County Circuit Court, to acquire, in Linn City, a strip of land about long and wide By 1869 Linn City was a settlement in name only, as the actual town, located on the west side of the river just below the falls, had been washed away by a flood in December 1861. =Legislative action= The deadline set by the legislature in the 1868 legislation proved to be impossible to meet. The subsidy was too small to attract investors. New legislation was approved in 1870. The 1870 law was substantially similar to the 1868 legislation, except that it increased the subsidy to $200,000, in the form of bonds payable in gold issued by the state of Oregon, to be issued upon posting of a surety bond in the amount of $300,000. The state-issued bonds were to fall due on January 1, 1881. Maximum tolls chargeable were in all circumstances to fifty cents per ton of freight and ten cents per passenger. The deadline for completion was rolled back to January 1, 1873. =Further corporate action= At the December 1870 annual meeting, Bernard Goldsmith and Joseph Teal, both of Portland, Orlando Humason and Jason K. Kelly, both of The Dalles, John F. Miller, of Salem, and David P. Thompson, of Oregon City were elected directors, who then on December 8, 1871, appointed company officers: Bernard Goldsmith, president; John F. Miller, vice-president; Joseph Teal, treasurer; and Septimus Huelat, from Oregon City, attorney and secretary. On February 3, 1871, supplemental articles of incorporation were filed, giving the company broadly expanded authority to collect tolls, deal in water rights and real property, and own and operate industries and steamboats. The $200,000 in state-issued bonds were augmented by an additional $200,000 in bonds issued by the company. Both bond issues were sold at a discount, the state bonds at 80% and the private bonds at 77.5%, and the proceeds, of $315,500, were used to build the locks and canal. Design The initial design, in January 1869, was reported to have been for a canal was 2,500 feet long, and 40 feet wide, with three locks about 200 feet long. However, bids were solicited in early 1871, based on plans and specifications of Calvin Brown, which called for four locks, each 160 feet long, with the canal about 2,900 long, and a wooden wall the whole length of the canal, with the locks themselves built of masonry. Isaac W. Smith took over as chief engineer in February 1871, before construction began. Smith recommended that the wooden wall be replaced with one built of stone, that the length of all locks be increased to 210 feet, and that a fifth lock, known as the \\"guard\\" lock, 1200 feet along the canal from the fourth lock. The contracts were let out on this basis. However, after carrying out only a small part of the work on the new basis, the contractors were unable to complete it. In December 1871, Smith reported to the company's board of directors that he had incorrectly calculated the quantity and cost of the rock that could be obtained near the work, and that stone walls could not be completed by the project deadline of January 1, 1873. By May 31, 1872, Smith had switched back to a timber wall, heavily bolted with iron and weighed down with stone. The switch was claimed to have saved from $75,000 to $100,000 from the construction costs, but it was criticized at the time as not being in compliance with the standards established by the state for the construction of the canal. Cost Various statements have been published as to the costs of the works. In 1893, a committee of the state legislature, in studying whether the state should purchase the locks, found that between $300,000 and $325 had been expended on construction. A study conducted in 1899 by the Corps of Engineers found an original incorporator of the company who stated that the total cost of the lock construction was $339,000, of which $35,000 was used to acquire the right of way, and a further $20,000 was used for \\"political extras\\", leaving the actual cost of construction as $284,000. Construction =Bids= Solicitation for bids for work on the canal and locks, January 20, 1871. On January 18, the company, from its headquarters at 93 Front Street, in Portland, called for sealed bids from contractors, with bidding to close at noon on March 1, 1871. Capt. Isaac W. Smith was the chief superintendent. E.G. Tilton was the chief Engineer; Tilton's assistant was J.A. Lessourd, who superintended the construction of the gates and the iron and wood work. Major King was the secretary for the project. A.H. Jordas, an engineer and architect from San Francisco, became one of the contractors and went on to supervise the work. The targeted completion date was December 1, 1872. The contractors were under heavy bond to finish the work by that time. Monthly payments to the contractors were based on the estimates of the supervising engineer, who lived at the works. The company held back 20% of the contract price as security for completion. Up to October 1872, the total cost of the work was estimated to have been $450,000, with about $50,000 more needed to be expended before completion. =Blasting= Blasting holes in the rock were cut by then-new steam-driven diamond-tipped drills manufactured by Severance & Holt, and mounted on small cars allowing them to be moved about the work as needed. Rather than reduce the rock to powder, as on previous designs, these drills cut a ring into the rock about 2 inches in diameter, with the remaining portion of the rock, called the core, passing out through a water-cooled iron tube. Twenty to thirty holes were drilled on a daily basis. Each drill could bore five to seven feet per hour. Blasting had to be done carefully so as not to make the spoil too small, as the broken rock was intended to be used for the stonework. A temporary dam was projected to be needed across the upper end of the works. As of September 1871, two steam derricks and two blacksmith's shops were employed on the works. Gates were to be set in the eastern wall of the canal to allow use of the river's water by industries to be located along the canal. =Dissipation of funds= In November 1871, one of the contractors, a Mr. Jordan, disappeared, leaving unpaid debts to various creditors of about $28,000 or more, as well as unpaid wages of $6,000. The company agreed to pay the wage claims. Isaac W. Smith took over Jordan's place, with the objective to speed construction as fast as weather permitted, and put an additional workforce in the spring if 1872 to meet the company's deadline as set by the state. =Workforce= Between 300 and 500 men worked on the project. About 100 men worked at night for most of the time. As of September 1871, the contractor was reported to have difficulty obtaining laborers and stonemasons, with only about 100 then being employed, with openings for 100 to 150 more. Reportedly that the \\"site of the works is healthy\\" and laborers would be paid wages equivalent to $2 per day in coin, with stonemasons receiving more. Masons and stone-cutters were paid from $5 to $6 per day, carpenters from $3 to $3.50 per day, and laborers received $2.50 per day. The monthly payroll was $50,000. On July 27, 1872, the Morning Oregonian reported that \\"sixty Chinamen are now employed at the locks at Linn City.\\" The successful completion of the project was reported to have been \\"secured by treating the men kindly and considerately and paying them liberally and promptly.\\" Additionally, it was reported that \\"the full pay of every man was never a minute behind time.\\" =Excavation= Excavation consisted of of rock, of loose rock, and of earth. Masonry installed comprised of first class work, of second class, and of third class. There was a gulch north (downstream) of the guard lock, which was filled in with cubic yards of stone or 40,000 tons. Exclusive of the foundation walls and fenders, the project consisted of of masonry, of timber walls above the guard lock, and of timber walls below the guard lock. Explosives used during construction included 18,000 pounds of giant powder and 10,000 pounds of black powder. Materials used in construction were 5,123 pounds of cement, 1,326,000 board feet of lumber, 180,700 pounds of iron for the gates, 71,000 pounds of iron for bolts for the canal walks, fenders and other components, not including iron used in machinery, derricks and other equipment, but only iron placed in the works. Completion and opening ceremony Gov. La Fayette Grover gave the inauguratory remarks at the opening of the locks on January 1, 1873. The locks were reported to be ready to pass vessels through on December 16, 1872, however the company intended to test the locks with a scow before letting any steamboats transit. A steamer was expected to be able to use the locks on December 25, 1872, however this proved impossible, because some of the gates were not working properly, and a few more days work would be necessary. Governor La Fayette Grover appointed three commissioners, former governor John Whiteaker, George R. Helm, and Lloyd Brook to examine the locks and accept them on behalf of the state if they were constructed in accordance with the law. The commissioners inspected the locks on Saturday, December 28, 1872. Maria Wilkins, a steamship, was the first vessel to use the locks. The locks were first placed in use on Wednesday, January 1, 1873. At 12:17 the small steamer Maria Watkins entered the first lock. Watkins was late, having been expected to arrive at 11:00 a.m. A large crowd of spectators cheered from alongside the walls of the lock as the steamer entered. The boat responded to the cheers with three blasts from the steam whistle. Each lock raised the vessel ten feet. After Watkins had transited the locks into the upper river, Governor Grover made some congratulatory remarks to the president of the locks company. This was met with three cheers, for the company's president, Bernard \\"Ben\\" Goldsmith, Col. Teal, Capt. Isaac W. Smith, and the governor. Watkins was carrying a number of dignitaries, including Gov. La Fayette Grover (1823‚Äì1911), Mayor of Portland Philip Wasserman, several newspaper editors, steamboat captain Joseph Kellogg, the locks commissioners, and other invited guests. There was only one woman on board. It took one hour forty-five minutes to pass Watkins through the locks. Returning down river took about an hour for the boat to transit the works. It was expected that the transit time could be cut down to one-half hour. Grover's support of the locks company was criticized a few years later, in 1878, in the Willamette Farmer (reprinted in the Oregon City Enterprise), which described the then-former governor as a \\"senile nincompoop\\" a \\"lick spittle and fawning sycophant\\" and the chief of the \\"minions and tools\\" of the Oregon Steam Navigation Company, whose principals had, by 1878, acquired control of the locks. =Dimensions in 1873= Looking north from Lock No. 1, after repairs in 1980. Governor Grover in the locks, probably lock 3, in 1873. The lock walls on the east side of the canal can be seen, as well as the masonry for the lock gates and the protective wooden fenders projecting above the lock walls. Upon completion, the total length of the canal and locks was , consisting of, from north (downstream) to south (upstream): * the approach to the first, or north lock, and feet wide. * four lift locks, each long and wide; * the canal south of the lift locks, long and to wide; * a guard lock long and wide; * a canal and basin, and from to . =Lock design= The lift locks were of a type known as \\"combined\\" locks, with the lower gate of one lock functioning as the upper gate of the lock next below. The lifting lock walls stood above the lock floors, and were at the top, with a batter of . All walls had their foundation on solid rock. The guard lock wall was high above the guard lock floor, but otherwise was similar to the walls at the lifting locks. The lifting locks were referred to by number, with lock 1, the furthest downstream, being both the northernmost and the lowest. The first and second locks were cut entirely out of solid rock except for the areas around the gates, where masonry was set in for the hollow quoins and supports for the gates. Each hollow quoin weighed 2 tons. Wooden fenders were bolted to the lock sides to prevent harm to vessels coming into contact with the natural rock that formed the sides of the first and second locks. The third lock likewise was cut into solid rock, but with walls above the surface. Wooden fenders, backed by three-inch timber, were tied into the rock with bolts. The fourth lock was almost entirely above the surface, with masonry walls on both sides. Each of the four lifting locks had a lift of . The total fall, from low water above the works, to low water below, was 40 feet. The lower end of the canal had been cut 40 feet deep through solid basalt. About of the west wall was built of timber on top of a stone wall resting on bedrock. The stone wall was at the top, to high, with a batter of . The rest of the west wall was hewn out of the natural rock. According to engineer Smith's 1873 report, the guard lock was left open when the water in the canal was less than . Otherwise, boats would have to lock through the guard lock. The guard lock was intended to prevent foods from flowing over the lower walls of the canal. In ordinary water conditions the guard lock would be left open, so as not to unnecessarily delay boats making the transit. Upstream (south) from the guard lock, the east side wall was timber-built, with bents apart. Each bent was bolted to the bedrock by three iron rods extending the full height of the cross braces on the bent. The entire timber wall was filled with stone. =Gate design= The gates were based on designs used in locks on the Monongahela River. Each swung on suspension rods mounted in iron brackets tied into masonry. The gates did not rest on rollers or tramways, and were easily worked by one man. Each gate had eight wickets, located near the bottom of the gate, with each wicket measuring by . The locks were flooded and drained by opening and closing the wickets, through the use of connecting rods. Two men were required to work each gate. There were two culverts under each gate sill to carry off mud and gravel which might otherwise impede the opening of the gates. Each lock gate was long and high. Buttresses think reinforced the walls carrying the gates. The gates were opened and closed with cranks. The stone used for the masonry was local basalt, except for the rock used for the hollow quoins, which was a some different basaltic type, but drawn from a quarry on the Clackamas River owned by someone named Baker. The masonry was set with hydraulic cement with no lime intermixture. The masonry walls were constructed of blocks of basalt, each weighing 1 to 2 tons. On completion, the maximum water depth in the lock was . A newspaper published at the time stated that the normal water depth in the river at the head of the canal was seven feet, and four and a half feet during low water seasons. This was sufficient to allow river boats to safety pass. Boats could transit the locks with up to of water on the upper guard lock gates. The guard lock was designed to allow a rail to be installed which would allow vessel transit with of water. However, on the few occasions every year when the river rose any higher, navigation could not be safely made, and the guard lock could not be opened. Operations 1873‚Äì1915 The masonry work was expected to last indefinitely, while the timber work was expected to be good for eight to ten years. Additional construction work still needed to be done for the first four or five months after the locks opened. Afterwards, it was expected that the annual costs of repairs would not exceed $600. Staffing requirements were estimated to be one lock superintendent, at $125 per month, and two lock-tenders, at $50 each per month. Some proponents of the canal and locks believed that their existence had a \\"regulating\\" effect upon railroad freight rates, by competing with the railroads for the shipper's business. New locks company formed On December 28, 1875, William Strong, W.H. Effinger, and Frank T. Dodge incorporated the Willamette Transportation and Locks Company, capitalized at $1,000,000, in shares of $100 each, with generally the same corporate purposes as the Willamette Falls Canal and Lock Company. On March 8, 1876, by a deed recorded in Clackamas County Willamette Falls Canal and Lock Company sold all its property, including the canal and locks, to Willamette Transportation and Locks Company for $500,000. On January 8, 1877, four prominent businessmen, John C. Ainsworth, Simeon G. Reed, Robert R. Thompson, and Bernard Goldsmith, filed supplemental articles of incorporation which increased the powers of Willamette Transportation and Locks Co. As of May 5, 1877, Simeon G. Reed was the vice-president of the new corporation, which in addition to owning the locks, owned and operated steamboats on the Willamette river. Ainsworth, Reed, and Thompson were closely associated with the powerful Oregon Steam Navigation Company (O.S.N.) An 1895 source considered the 1876 transaction to be a sale to the O.S.N. As of 1880, Willamette Transportation and Locks Co. was controlled by the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company (O.R.&N;) Locks commission and toll collections Oregon laws passed in 1876 and 1882 established a canal commission, composed of the governor, secretary of state, and the state treasurer, with the authority to visit the works and bring legal action to compel keeping and maintenance of the canal. The consent of the canal commission was necessary for any repairs or improvements except in emergencies. Vessels using the canal were required report of freight tonnage and passengers carried. The locks company was also required report quarterly to the canal commission. The first lock tender on duty was John \\"Jack\\" Chambers (1841‚Äì1929). Chambers had been in charge of the heavy rock work during the construction of the canal and locks. He was to serve on the locks for fifty years and became known to every steamboat captain that operated on the Willamette River. Initial tolls for use of the locks were set at the legal maximum of fifty cents per ton of freight and 10 cents for every passenger. Despite the legal requirement to send the state 10% of the net toll proceedings, by 1893 only a single payment had been made, of $435 for the year 1873. The justification for sending no other payments was that after that time there had been no net proceeds arising from the collection of tolls. On November 23, 1905, the state of Oregon, represented by attorney general A.M. Crawford, and district attorney John Manning, brought suit in the Oregon circuit court against the Portland General Electric Company to recover 10 percent of the tolls collected from the operation of the locks since 1873. In 1907, the toll collector at the locks was the local station agent of the O.R.&N; (Southern Pacific) at Oregon City. One-half of the agent's salary was paid by the O.R.&N; and the other half was paid by Portland General Electric. In 1906, an Open River Association was formed at Albany, Oregon which argued for the acquisition by the public of the Willamette Falls Locks. The Open River Association and its sympathizers favored free tolls after the government obtained the locks. On November 17, 1906, Judge Arthur L. Frazer (1860‚Äì1907), of the Multnomah County Circuit Court, ruled that the law requiring sharing of the net tolls with the state only applied to the Willamette Falls and Locks Company, and not to any successor in interprets, because the law referred to the Willamette Falls and Locks Company by name and did not include any successors or assigns, nor did the law make the state's share a specific charge upon the locks themselves.  Financing, water rights, and corporation reorganizations  On January 1, 1887, Willamette Transportation and Locks Co. issued mortgage bonds in the amount of $420,000 to New York businessman and O.R.&N; president Elijah Smith These bonds acted as a lien upon the canal and locks and were still outstanding in 1893. In 1889, the company granted two industrial firms, Willamette Pulp and Paper Co, and Crown Paper Co. building sites along the canal and rights to withdraw water from the canal for industrial purposes. To permit this without hindering navigation, an additional flume was built to fill the canal. On August 8, 1892, P.F. Morey, Frederick V. Holman, and Charles H. Caufield incorporated the Portland General Electric Company with a capitalization of $4,250,000. Among the purposes of the new company were the owning and operating of the Willamette falls canal and locks, as well as use of the water power of the falls for any lawful purpose. Charles H. Caufield, secretary of Portland General Electric, was formerly secretary of the Willamette Transportation and Locks Company. On August 24, 1892, for nominal consideration, the Willamette Falls and Locks Company sold all its real property, including the canal and locks, to Portland General Electric. Oregon permitted the state to buy the locks and canal in 1893, twenty years after completion, but this option was never exercised. Average toll receipts for the six years of 1887 through 1892 were approximately $15,750 annually. With the locks and canal estimated to have cost a total of $450,000, this would have a return, after deducting $2,700 for labor and $1,000 for repairs, which would have been a return of less than 2.75%. As of February 1908, the stock of the Portland General Electric company was owned by the Portland Railway, Light and Power Company. Flood damage 1890 West Shore, a literary magazine of the period. Note industries on the left side of the canal. The flood of 1890 seriously damaged the locks. The canal was flooded with debris. Two lock gates were destroyed, as was the home of lock tender Jack Chambers. Additional work was scheduled to be done in 1893, which was anticipated to cost between $135,000 and $150,000. The projected work consisted of widening 1,300 feet of the canal to 80 feet, and replacing a decaying and leaking portion of the timber-built wall with a masonry structure. The widened canal would permit a faster transit of steamboats through the locks by allowing them to pass each other in the canal, and would permit a greater accumulation of water for industrial and navigation use. Additionally, at a cost of $16,000, the lower lock was to be deepened to allow safe passage of the larger steamboats when the river was at a low water state. Leaking gates at Lock 2 of the Willamette Falls Locks, April 10, 1899. The lock wickets are in closed position, but the gates are in such disrepair that water is streaming out through them. Photo probably shot from a government snag boat with a derrick seen in the image. Federal acquisition On March 3, 1899, the locks were examined by a board of United States Engineers to report on whether the locks should be acquired by the United States Government. By 1899, the wooden lock gates were rotten and leaking badly. They had been replaced only once since 1873. Nearly all the timber work would soon require replacement. Woodwork in the region, if exposed to weather, required replacement about every eight to nine years, and in wet areas replacement was required even earlier. =Study by Corps of Engineers= The total cost, in 1899, of work necessary to restore the locks to the original operating condition of 1873 was calculated to be about $38,800. The 1899 replacement value of the entire project was calculated to be $314,300. Using another method, including data from the net profits of the works, and including the anticipated costs of necessary replacement work, the Corps of Engineers estimated the value of the canal and locks, in 1899, as $421,000. The 1899 report recommended acquisition provided the locks could be purchased at a reasonable price. (By this time the mortgage bonds issued to Elijah Smith had been paid off.) However, the price asked by the owners, in 1899, was $1,200,000, which the government regarded as too high. By 1899 the works were in poor repair and few improvements had been made. So much water in the canal was diverted for manufacturing purposes that it seriously interfered with use of the locks for navigation. In the years 1882 through 1899 (half year), there were 12,863.5 lockages, carrying 234,451.5 passengers, and 504,145.04 tons of freight. In the five years from 1894 through 1898, net profit for the locks ranged from a low of $21,210.13 in 1896 to a high of $28,503.10 in 1898. =Steps towards acquisition= In June 1902, Congress passed a Rivers and Harbors act which authorized a study of whether the canal and locks should be acquired by the U.S. government. In the previous year, Portland General Electric, had earned about $35,000 from the tolls on the locks and canal. On November 21, 1902, a board of officers of the Corps of Engineers, consisting of Maj. John Millis, of Seattle, Capt. W/C Langfitt of Portland, and Lt. R.P. Johnson, of San Francisco, made a preliminary inspection of the locks. The major issue associated with the proposed purchase was the question of water rights. The industries on the west bank of the river below the falls received all their power from water drawn from the navigation canal. They used so much water that when the river level was low, it was impossible to conduct industrial operations and navigation at the same time. The U.S. government was only willing to acquire the works if there would be sufficient water for navigation. Another difficult point was that in 1902, the owner of the canal and locks, Portland General Electric, was continuing to ask the same sales price, $1,200,000, which the government had found too high in 1899. Portland General Electric argued that since it owned both sides of the Willamette River at the falls, it controlled all the rights to the use of the water flowing over the falls from bank to bank. Consideration was then being given to the possibility of constructing a new canal on the east side of the falls rather than purchasing the existing canal on the west side. The company's position in response was that the government would have to condemn and pay for the water rights on any newly-constructed canal. Oregon's U.S. Attorney John Hall was reported however to have turned in an opinion to the Attorney General that the government had the legal authority to build new locks, provided they were located below the ordinary high-water mark of the river. In 1907, the Oregon state legislature passed a bill appropriating $300,000 to be paid to the federal government to help purchase the Willamette Canal and Locks. However, in 1908, Judge Frazer's decision was reversed following an appeal to the Oregon Supreme Court.* On May 31, 1909, while replacing a lock gate, three men were injured when the false work supporting the old gate collapsed, and the gate fell, causing one man to sustain a broken leg, another was badly bruised, and a third man had lacerations on his legs. In 1911, the canal and locks were valued at $300,000 for property tax purposes, and assessed a tax of $5,587.50 against them, which was paid, late, by the owner of the works, the Portland Railway, Light & Power Co. =Acquisition complete= Oregon City suspension bridge. The steamer N.R. Lang is on the right. By this date, sometime after 1900, a large concentration of industry has arisen just to the east of the canal. In 1912, the War Department approved purchase of the locks from Portland Railway, Light & Power Company. The purchase price was to be $375,000. The transaction did not finally close until 1915. The reason for the delay was the need to establish the vendor's title to the property, as well as to work out the details of the various conditions that the vendor wished to attach to the sale. The title problems stem from the fact that the town of Linn City, which had been on the west side of the false, had been washed away by a flood in 1862, apparently along with all of its records. While the owners and operators of the locks appeared to be able to claim title by adverse possession, this would not be considered sufficient by the U.S. government, which required proof of the plat map of the town of Linn City. By August 1912, a search was underway for a map of Linn City. An official of the Corps of Engineers had heard from one old resident of Linn City that a map had survived the flood, but this map could not be found. The official intended to consult with George H. Himes, of the Oregon Historical Society to learn more about Linn City. Before the transfer to the U.S. government some mills near the locks drew their water directly from the upper lock level. This created currents which impeded navigation through the lock. The government was unwilling to permit this to continue under its ownership, so, as part of the conditions of the sale, the United States would be required to build a wall in the navigation canal which would have the effect of creating a separate water source, with an opening well above the falls, for the canal side industries. In April 1915 the cost of this wall, estimated to be between $125,000 and $150,000, would be the largest single item of work then planned for the locks and canal. Other work that the government intended to carry out included repair of the lock gates and deepening the approaches to the locks. The lower sill of the downstream lock was to be lowered, and a new pair of gates was to be constructed. Reconstruction 1916‚Äì1917 Construction of a temporary wooden flume to allow transit of the Willamette Falls Canal and Locks (upper) and sternwheel steamer Pomona making first use of the temporary flume 10 days later (below), April 1917. The reconstruction of the canal and locks was supervised by Major H.C. Jewett, of the Corps of Engineers, and E.B. Thomson, assistant engineer in the Second District. Construction on the wall began in April 1916. By September 1916, about 1000 feet of the wall to divide the canal and locks from the industrial flume had been built, using cofferdams. About 200 feet of wall downstream from the guard lock were still left to be completed. To permit river traffic to continue while reconstruction was underway, the Army Corps of Engineers built a wooden flume as a temporary canal. A cofferdam would have been too costly to employ because of the depth of the water. The flume was to be 42 feet wide with a depth of 6 feet. The inside of the flume would be sealed by spreading oil-treated canvas tightly over the planking. The entire structure would be heavily braced to support the weight of the water and passing riverboats. Construction of the flume would leave the bottom and both sides of the canal dry to permit the pouring of concrete. The wall was complete on September 1, 1917. It was 1280 feet long, running from the guard lock to lock No. 4. At points the wall was more 50 feet high. The estimated cost of construction of the wall was $150,000, but it was reported to have been completed for considerably less. Congress had allocated $80,000 to improve the lower locks, by deepening them, installing concrete foundations under the lock gates, and other work. However, upon completion of the canal wall, on September 1, 1917, shippers were opposed to the work being carried out at that time, because it would interfere with navigation. They wanted the work postponed until the summer of 1918 so that the harvest of 1917 could be moved downriver. The local Corps of Engineers wanted the work to continue interrupted, because a workforce had been assembled and Congress might reallocate the funds due to the war.  Recent repairs and closure  With no funding available to perform needed inspections and repairs, the locks were closed in January 2008.The Sunday Oregonian, Metro Northwest Section, page 3, January 13, 2008 In April 2009, as part of the federal government's economic stimulus plan, $1.8 million was allocated to repair and inspect the locks, with an additional $900,000 allocated in October 2009 for additional repairs and operational costs. The locks reopened in January 2010 with the Willamette Queen the first vessel to pass. The locks were open through the summer of 2010, and then due to a lack of federal funding for operations, were not scheduled to reopen for 2011. In December 2011, the locks were again closed, this time owing to the excessive corrosion of the locks' gate anchors. The further deterioration of the locks resulted in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reclassifying the locks as being in a \\"non-operational status,\\" out of concern that any further operation of the locks could lead to a failure of the locks, posing a safety risk to the public. The locks are expected to remain permanently closed, as the lack of traffic through the locks makes funding for any repairs a low priority. However, some interest groups are urging the Army Corps of Engineers to reopen the locks, at least seasonally, and the Clackamas County Board of Commissioners added its support to that effort in December 2014. Placed on National Register The locks were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.

The story revolves around the quest of two robots (the band members, played by Peter Hurteau and Michael Reich) to become human. The music featured in the film is not by Daft Punk, which is a first for the duo after their previous film and home video releases, D.A.F.T.: A Story About Dogs, Androids, Firemen and Tomatoes and Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem. The duo instead served as directors and co-wrote the film, along with Daft Arts manager Paul Hahn and collaborator C√©dric Hervet. The film premiered at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival, and was later released in France on March 24, 2007. While initially receiving mixed reviews, Electroma has gained a cult following. Plot The two lead characters appear as the robotic forms of Daft Punk and are credited as \\"Hero Robot No. 1\\" and \\"Hero Robot No. 2\\". One wears a silver helmet and the other wears a golden one. An opening scene shows the duo driving in a 1987 Ferrari 412 with its license plate displaying \\"HUMAN\\". After passing through a Southwestern United States landscape, the duo arrives by car at a town in Inyo County, California. The town's residents are also shown to be robots physically identical to the two main characters, but at different ages, with different clothing and alternating gender. The pair drive to a high-tech facility where liquid latex is poured over their heads. The latex is shaped into human-like faces with the aid of prosthetic appliances and wigs. The resulting look caricaturizes the members of Daft Punk, Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo. When the two leave the facility, the locals of the town are shocked by their human appearance. The townsfolk gradually begin to chase the duo, whose faces eventually melt in the sun. The two take cover in a public restroom where the gold robot discards his ruined mask, then encourages the reluctant silver robot to do the same. Again appearing as robots, the pair then undergo a lengthy hike across desert salt flats. After walking for an extended period, the silver robot slows down and comes to a stop. Becoming aware of this, the gold robot walks back to the silver one. The silver robot continues to stare at the ground for a moment before removing his own jacket. He then turns away from the other robot, revealing a switch on his back. The gold robot flips the switch, which begins a timer. When the countdown ends, the silver robot is blown to pieces. The remaining robot piles the remains of the silver robot, then continues to walk. The gold robot eventually falls to his knees and attempts to reach the switch on his own back, but to no avail. Another moment passes before the robot removes his helmet and repeatedly slams it into the ground until the helmet shatters. Using one of the shards as a burning-glass, the robot focuses the sunlight to set his hand ablaze. The film ends as the robot, completely on fire, walks in slow motion through darkness.

Court cases =Surfthechannel.com= In June 2009, FACT brought a groundbreaking criminal prosecution against the company Scopelight and its founder, Anton Vickerman, for running a pirate video search engine called Surfthechannel.com, which had a substantial user base and was a highly profitable illegal business. FACT commenced a private criminal prosecution, which required access to all the evidence in the custody of the police. Action taken by Scopelight's owners to prevent the evidence being given to FACT was rejected at the Court of Appeal (Scopelight & Ors v Chief Constable of Northumbria Police & Federation Against Copyright Theft [2009] EWCA Civ 1156) where the Court judgment made clear the legality of providing evidence to support a private prosecution. Vickerman was charged with two counts of Conspiracy to Defraud and a criminal trial took place at Newcastle Crown Court in June and July 2012 in front of His Honour Judge Evans. After a seven-week trial, the jury found Anton Vickerman guilty and he was sentenced to four years' imprisonment on each charge of Conspiracy to Defraud, sentencing to run concurrently. The importance of this case was how it demonstrated that existing laws are applicable when investigating criminality that takes place only online. Subsequently, Vickerman was ordered to pay ¬£73,055.79 within six months or face a further prison sentence under proceeds of crime legislation. =Newzbin= In 2011 access to the Usenet indexing website Newzbin was blocked by BT and Sky following legal action in the UK by Hollywood film studios.

In 2018, following a FACT-assisted case the owner of the company Evolution Trading, Jon Haggerty, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and dishonestly obtaining services for another. Haggerty was sentenced to five years and three months' imprisonment. His wife, Mary Gilfillan, was convicted of fraud offences and given a two-year suspended sentence. =Dreambox= Three men provided illegal access to Premier League football to more than 1,000 pubs, clubs and homes throughout England and Wales and used a range of technologies to commit fraud over the course of a decade. Trading under the names Dreambox (unincorporated), Dreambox TV Limited and Digital Switchover Limited, the fraudulent companies earned in excess of ¬£5m through illegal activity. Following a FACT-assisted Premier League investigation, this case saw some of the longest sentences ever issued for piracy-related crimes. In 2019 Steven King, who masterminded the fraud, was sentenced to seven years and four months' imprisonment. Paul Rolston was sentenced to six years and four months‚Äô imprisonment and Daniel Malone was sentenced to three years and three months' imprisonment. =Bovingdon Market= As part of ongoing investigations at Bovingdon Market by Hertfordshire Trading Standards in 2020, supported by FACT, two men were found guilty of encouraging consumers to obtain services dishonestly, contrary to the Serious Crime Act 2007 and the Fraud Act 2006. The jury also found Thomas Tewelde and Mohamed Abdou guilty of failing in their duty of care to ensure that the boxes were electrically safe. Tewelde and Abdou were each sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment suspended for two years and were ordered to pay ¬£1,000 in costs and complete 120 hours of unpaid work. =Former police officer jailed= Daniel Aimson was a police officer previously jailed in 2017 for bulk sale cannabis production. A joint operation between Greater Manchester Police and FACT found that a company managed by Aimson sold IPTV devices between September 2016 and May 2017 that allowed customers to bypass paywalls and access subscription sport and film channels for free. In 2020 Aimson admitted conspiracy to commit fraud and was sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment. Anti-piracy warnings The 1995‚Äì1998 Columbia-Tristar version of \\"Beware of Illegal Video Cassettes\\" Pirate Videos: Daylight Robbery FACT has produced several adverts which have appeared at the beginning of videos and DVDs released in the UK, as well as trailers shown before films in cinemas. =1990s= During the 1990s, FACT created a 30-second to 1-minute anti-piracy warning called \\"Beware of Illegal Video Cassettes\\", reminding customers to check whether they have a genuine video and how to report questionable copies. They appeared on many different video cassettes by various home video companies. Versions for each studio depicting their respective security label (generally a hologram of the studio logo or a Disney film logo) were created, with several iterations for each as the FACT hotline number changed multiple times throughout the decade with the message \\"Video Piracy Is A Crime, Do Not Accept It‚Äù. The warning was placed at the beginning of most rental VHS tapes in the UK (as well as many retail tapes), similar to the FBI Warning found on tapes in the United States. CIC Video and The Walt Disney Company had a similar term, with the hologram carrying CIC logo copies. From late 1996, this warning was followed by a public information film featuring a man attempting to return a pirate video purchased from a market after discovering that the sound was garbled and the picture unwatchable, ending with the tagline \\"Pirate Videos: Daylight Robbery‚Äù. The \\"Pirate Videos: Daylight Robbery\\" ad was used until 2002. A precursor PIF, \\"Video Piracy: It's Not Worth It!\\" was released in 1995 and featured a young girl named Rebecca trying to watch a pirated VHS tape on a TV, ending with a VHS player falling down with the words on top: \\"VIDEO PIRACY. It's not worth it‚Äù. =2000s= In 2002, FACT released a PIF called \\"The Pirates are Out to Get You\\". It featured a man destroying many items with an X-shaped branding iron, ending with the FACT logo and UK, Ireland, Australia & New Zealand hotlines. The warning was placed at the beginning of practically every rental VHS tape in the UK (as well as most retail tapes), similar to the FBI Warning found on tapes in the United States. With the advent of DVD, FACT borrowed the Motion Picture Association of America's anti-piracy spot \\"You Wouldn't Steal a Car\\", which concentrated more on copyright infringement through peer-to-peer filesharing and less on counterfeit copies. The spot related the peer-to-peer filesharing of movies to stealing a handbag, a car, and other such items (similar to the US FAST \\"Piracy is theft\\" slogan of the 1990s). More recent spots have included Knock-off Nigel, devised by the Industry Trust for Intellectual Property Awareness, where a man is ridiculed by his friends and colleagues for buying counterfeit DVDs and downloading films from BitTorrent, along with ads that say \\"Thank You\\" to the British public for supporting the film industry by either buying a ticket and seeing a film in the cinema or purchasing a genuine DVD or Blu-ray.

In this context, soap is used in its formal sense, a metal salt of a fatty acid: in this case stearic acid. It is a white solid that repels water. It is insoluble in polar solvents such as alcohol and ether but soluble in aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., benzene) and chlorinated hydrocarbons when heated. It is the most powerful mold release agent among all metal soaps. It contains no electrolyte and has a hydrophobic effect. Its main application areas are the plastics and rubber industry, where it is used as a releasing agent and lubricant which can be easily incorporated.David J.

Zinc carboxylates, e.g. basic zinc acetate, adopt complex formulas, and are not simply dicarboxylates of zinc. Instead the formula for most zinc carboxylates is Zn4O(O2CR)6, consisting of a Zn4O6+ core with carboxylate ligands spanning the edges. Applications It is widely used as a release agent for the production of many kinds of objects: rubber, polyurethane, polyester processing system, powder metallurgy.

Best remembered for originating the lyric baritone roles in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas from 1877 to 1896, his performing career spanned more than four decades. He also wrote at least a dozen works for the stage.Walters, p. 21, fn. 25 After two years with a comic touring company, Barrington joined Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera company and, over the next two decades, created a number of memorable comic opera roles, including Captain Corcoran in H.M.S. Pinafore (1878), the Sergeant of Police in The Pirates of Penzance (1880), and Pooh Bah in The Mikado (1885), among many others. Failing in an 1888 attempt to become a theatrical manager, Barrington refocused his energies on acting and occasional playwriting. Beginning in 1896 and continuing for ten years, Barrington played in a series of very successful musical comedies under the management of George Edwardes at Daly's Theatre, specialising in comic portrayals of pompous rulers or other persons of authority. One of the most popular features of his performances was his insertion of topical songs, or verses of songs, into these musical comedies. After leaving Daly's he continued to appear in musical comedy roles and performed in music hall. He also essayed a few Shakespeare and other dramatic roles and appeared in a few silent films. His career ended in 1918, after which he suffered a stroke and lived the last few years of his life in poverty. Life and career Barrington was born George Rutland Fleet at Penge, England, the fourth son of John George Fleet (1818‚Äì1902), a wholesale sugar dealer in London.The Times, 2 June 1922, p. 16 His mother was the former Esther Faithfull (1823‚Äì1908) of Headley, Surrey, England.Parker, J. \\"Barrington, Rutland (1853‚Äì1922)\\", rev.

Barrington was employed in a bank for eighteen months as a young man, but had no enthusiasm for such work, as he had ambitions to be an actor. Barrington's father did not want his son to go on the stage and forbade him to do so until he came of age.Barrington (1908), p. 32 His aunt, activist and dramatic reader Emily Faithfull, helped him to make his first connections in the theatre.Barrington (1908), p. 15 Barrington was a keen football player in the mid-1870s.See, e.g., Morning Post for 1 February 1873, 10 November 1873 and 30 October 1874. He discusses this in several places in his 1908 memoir. In 1880, Barrington married Ellen Louisa \\"Louie\\" Jane Stainer (1851‚Äì1922), from Woolwich in Kent, the daughter of William Stainer and the former Lucy Mary Wheeler. Barrington and his wife had no children.See London GRO marriage register in Q4 1880. In the 1881, 1891 and 1901 censuses, the couple are named as living together in London with no children. In the 1911 census, they are not listed as living together, and there is a notation that the marriage lasted for 36 years. They were living together again later, however, and spent their last years together; Mrs. Barrington was an alcoholic and died of cirrhosis of the liver in October 1922.Daniels, Vincent. \\"Rutland Barrington, the last years\\", Gilbert and Sullivan News, Vol. V, No. 7, Spring 2015, London: The Gilbert and Sullivan Society, pp. 11‚Äì14The Times, 7 June 1922, p. 9 =Early career; joining D'Oyly Carte's company= Barrington as Dr Daly in The Sorcerer, 1877 Barrington adopted his stage name by 1874\\"Rutland Barrington in The Two Orphans: Olympic Theatre\\", The Era, 4 October 1874 and made his professional debut with Henry Neville's company at the Olympic Theatre that year, playing the role of Sir George Barclay in Tom Taylor's Lady Clancarty, and then in The Ticket-of-Leave Man (by Taylor) and as LaFleur in The Two Orphans, among others. In July 1875, Barrington was playing Jules Frantz in Lessons in Harmony at St. George's Hall, London. A review in The Era reviewed the young actor's performance: \\"A good figure and expressive face were known to be among his advantages, but it was, perhaps, not suspected that he was a capital vocalist, a skilled musician, and an actor of remarkable ease and animation.\\"The Era, 4 July 1875 Later that year, he was hired to appear in the touring company of Mr and Mrs Howard Paul.Mrs Paul left her husband (Howard Paul, 1830‚Äì1905) around 1877, as he was having an affair with the actress-dancer Letty Lind, with whom he sired two illegitimate children. However, she continued performing under this name, often humorously impersonating the famous tenor Sims Reeves. See Barrington (1908), p. 21 The company played a hectic schedule of entertainments.Barrington (1908), pp. 21‚Äì22 In 1877 the producer Richard D'Oyly Carte approached Mrs Paul to play the part of Lady Sangazure in the new Gilbert and Sullivan opera, The Sorcerer, which he was presenting. She accepted, provided her 24-year-old prot√©g√©, Barrington, was given a part, and he was cast in the role of Dr Daly, the vicar.Stone, David. \\"Rutland Barrington\\", Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, 27 July 2002, accessed 1 January 2018 When he auditioned before W. S. Gilbert, the young actor questioned his own suitability for comic opera, but Gilbert, who required that his actors play their sometimes-absurd lines in all earnestness, explained the casting choice: \\"He's a staid, solid swine, and that's what I want.\\" In his 1908 autobiography, Barrington repeats a line from a first night review of his performance as Dr Daly in The Sorcerer: \\"Mr Barrington is wonderful. He always manages to sing one-sixteenth of a tone flat; it's so like a vicar.\\"Barrington (1908), p. 30 Barrington went on to say that producer Richard D'Oyly Carte later came to see him, saying, \\"...what's the matter? ...some one has just come out of the stalls to tell me you are singing in tune. It will never do.\\" Barrington said that \\"This pleased me so much that I have never sung flat since, except, of course, when I wished....\\"Barrington (1908), p. 31 Several contemporaries did find Barrington's singing occasionally flat, including Francois Cellier.Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 158 Many years later, in her memoir, Ellaline Terriss wrote: \\"...dear old Rutland scarcely ever did sing in tune ‚Äì but how grand he was.... He had a beautifully clear diction and a marvellous sense of timing ‚Äì and was one of the finest singers of the then popular topical songs that our stage ever knew.\\"Excerpt from Terris, Ellaline. \\"Curtain Up at the Gaiety\\" in Just a Little Bit of String, pp. 113‚Äì15 (1955) Hutchinson & Co., London , accessed 9 March 2008 Percy Hetherington Fitzgerald wrote of Barrington in his 1899 book, The Savoy Opera, \\"His peculiar tranquil or impassive style has always exactly suited the characters allotted to him, and it would now be difficult to imagine a Savoy opera without him. Fitzgerald, Percy Hetherington. The Savoy Opera (1899) Chatto & Windus, p. 38, accessed 9 March 2008 However, Barrington's performance as Dr Daly impressed the critics and audiences, and he won a permanent place in D'Oyly Carte's company.Walters, p. 16 =Pinafore to Ruddigore= Playing Corcoran in H.M.S. Pinafore, revival From 1877 to 1894, except for a foray into the business of theatrical management in 1888‚Äì89, Barrington remained with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, creating comic lyric baritone roles in all of Gilbert and Sullivan's new operas with the exception of The Yeomen of the Guard (1888). In 1878, he created the role of Lord Chamberlain in Albery's and Cellier's curtain raiser, The Spectre Knight, played the Counsel for the Plaintiff in the revival of Trial by Jury,Rollins and Witts, p. 5 and created the role of Captain Corcoran in Gilbert and Sullivan's first smash hit, H.M.S. Pinafore. Barrington was a big man, which led to one of Gilbert's famous quips in a rehearsal for Pinafore. Gilbert asked Barrington to sit \\"pensively\\" on one of the ship's skylights. Barrington lowered himself into position, and the hastily sewn set piece collapsed under his weight. Gilbert remarked, \\"No, that's ex-pensively.\\" Barrington also created the role of Pennyfather in Desprez and Cellier's curtain raiser, After All! (1878).After All!, The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive (2007) Barrington played Mr. Cox in Carte's revival of Cox and Box (1879) and created the role of the Sergeant of Police in The Pirates of Penzance in London (1880). Barrington was proud that the Sergeant's song generally received two encores. Eventually, he asked Gilbert to write an \\"encore verse\\" for the song. Gilbert replied that \\"encore\\" means \\"sing it again.\\"Barrington (1908), p. 39 Also around this time, Barrington's short play entitled Quid Pro Quo, written with Cunningham Bridgeman and composed by Wilfred Bendall, was first produced.Described as \\"a vaudeville\\", Quid Pro Quo played at the Dilettantes Circle, a private club, in March 1881 with Barrington and fellow Savoyard Emily Cross playing the two roles. See The Theatre, April 1881 and Clarence, Reginald, The Stage Cyclopaedia ‚Äì a bibliography of plays, p. 374 (Burt, Franklin New York, 1909; 1970 reprint). The piece played at the Opera Comique under the management of John Hollingshead from October to December 1881 as a forepiece to Gilbert and Clay's opera, Princess Toto, and then in March 1882 as a forepiece to The Mother-in-law, in both cases starring Emily Cross again as Lady Ethel, and George Temple as Lord Arthur. See Kurt G√§nzl's The British Musical Theatre, vol. l 1865‚Äì1914, p. 191 (Macmillan Press, 1986). It was revived, with revisions, at St George's Hall in 1886 (Clarence, p. 374) and again in 1889 (The Musical Times, 1 August 1889, p. 486).Barrington, Rutland. Script of Quid Pro Quo at Amazon, accessed 9 March 2008 Playing Hildebrand in Princess Ida, 1884 The next role that Barrington created was Archibald Grosvenor in Patience (1881). Casting the large Barrington as the \\"perfect\\" and \\"infallible\\" incarnation of manly beauty mirrored a joke in Gilbert's earlier A Sensation Novel, in which he cast the large, ungainly Corney Grain, in a similar role. This was followed by the role of Earl Mountararat in Iolanthe (1882; he also appeared in Margate, Kent in an 1882 Christmas pantomime of Robin Hood written by George Thorne), and King Hildebrand in Princess Ida (1884). This role was Barrington's least favourite of the series, and he attributed Ida's relatively short run, at least in part, to the lack of prominence of this role in the opera.Barrington (1908), p. 54 During the run of Princess Ida, a comedy written by Barrington and called Bartonmere Towers was first presented at a matinee. After Princess Ida closed, Barrington reprised his role of Dr Daly and also played the Learned Judge in the revival of The Sorcerer and Trial (1884‚Äîover the years, Barrington frequently played the Judge in D'Oyly Carte's and various \\"benefit\\" performances of Trial). He also played Dr Dozey in Sydney Grundy's The Silver Shield (1885).Walters, p. 17 In 1885, he created his most famous role, that of Pooh-Bah in The Mikado. The Theatre's review was typical of the critics' unanimous praise: \\"The Pooh- Bah of Mr. Barrington is a masterpiece of pompous stolidity ‚Äì nothing could possibly be better of its kind ‚Äì and this popular comedian provided his many admirers with an agreeable surprise by singing every note of the music allotted to him in perfect tune.\\" In June 1885, he played together with Eric Lewis (Grossmith's understudy) in an afternoon \\"musical dialogue,\\" Mad to Act, with words by Barrington and music by Wilfred Bendall, at the Japanese Village in Knightsbridge.\\"The Female School of Art Bazaar\\", The Times, 27 June 1885, p. 8 With Jessie Bond as Despard and Margaret, 1887 Next, Barrington created the role of Sir Despard Murgatroyd in Ruddigore and then reprised his original roles in revivals of Pinafore, Pirates and The Mikado in (1887‚Äì88). During rehearsals for Ruddigore, and after discussions with other cast members on the subject, Barrington complained to Gilbert about the guests that Gilbert frequently invited to rehearsals, saying that he didn't wish to be taught the stage business \\"before a row of ...strangers.\\" Gilbert forgave Barrington for the outburst and even discontinued the invitations. However, if anyone sat in the stalls during later rehearsals awaiting their cue, Gilbert would expostulate, \\"You mustn't sit here; Barrington won't like it.\\"Barrington (1908), p. 61 The Times said of Barrington's performances, \\"His strength lay in his quietness of voice and movement... in perfect contrast to the restlessness of George Grossmith. No one could be so ridiculously pompous... he moved with effect. There was a native drollery in his lightly rolling dance, a comic dignity in his rotund and placid, yet twinklingly intelligent face. He always gave the impression of thoroughly enjoying whatever he did....\\" In its review of Ruddigore, The Theatre wrote, \\"Better comic acting than his, or more highly finished, I have never seen and never wish to see.\\"The Theatre, 1 February 1887, 4th series 9: pp. 95‚Äì98, accessed 9 March 2008 =Theatrical management experiment and later Savoy roles= With Courtice Pounds, as Marco and Giuseppe, 1889 In 1888, Barrington left the D'Oyly Carte organisation and the Savoy Theatre, missing the chance to create the role of Wilfred in Yeomen, to try his hand at theatrical management, leasing the St. James's Theatre. The Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News lamented Barrington's departure, suggesting that he was irreplaceable in the Savoy Operas: \\"He is the typical embodiment... of that British Philistinism, the pachydermatous hide of which Mr. Gilbert has so long striven to penetrate by the process of holding up its own image before it.\\"Stedman, p. 249 In March 1888, Barrington played Chrysos in a benefit performance of Gilbert's Pygmalion and Galatea, a role that he would reprise at a number of \\"benefit\\" performances over the years. Later in the year, at the St. James's, Barrington produced The Dean's Daughter by Grundy and F. C. Phillips, also playing the Very Reverend Augustus St. Aubyn, Dean of Southwark. Though the piece was unsuccessful, Barrington's performance was praised, and it launched several theatrical careers, including Olga Nethersole's.A description of the opening night of The Dean's Daughter in \\"Olga Nethersole (1870‚Äì1957), Actress, Manager\\" (Wayne Turney website) , accessed 9 March 2008 Gilbert's Brantinghame Hall (an abject failure), starred Barrington as Mr. Thursby, as well as his younger brother, Duncan Fleet, Julia Neilson and Lewis Waller (the latter two in their professional stage debuts). Its companion piece was A Patron Saint.Information about cast and companion piece of Brantinghame Hall (David B. Lovell's \\"Programmes\\" website) , accessed 9 March 2008 This experiment in management proved to be a financial disaster for Barrington, and he was bankrupt after only five months.Stedman, pp. 252‚Äì58. Jessie Bond and Barrington on their duologues tour in 1891 After Brantinghame Hall closed, he again played Chrysos in a revival of Pygmalion and Galatea at the Lyceum Theatre and played Mr Barnes in his own play, To the Death, at the Olympic Theatre. He then appeared at the Comedy Theatre under Charles Hawtrey in Pickwick (1889), a successful one-act musical play by F. C. Burnand and Edward Solomon based on an episode in The Pickwick Papers, which Barrington ended up directing and in which he alternated in the roles of Pickwick and Baker.Barrington (1908), pp. 79‚Äì80 Barrington then created the role of Lt. Col. Cadbury in a Grundy farce called Merry Margate and next played Tosser in a comic opera by Solomon and George P. Hawtrey called Penelope, in which he co-starred with Dan Leno.Walters, p. 18Anthony, p. 90 He also played a number of other roles in other theatres throughout 1889 until he rejoined D'Oyly Carte to create the role of Giuseppe in The Gondoliers in December 1889, remaining for the long run of that last Gilbert and Sullivan hit. After The Gondoliers closed in 1891, Gilbert and Sullivan were estranged for a time. Barrington appeared in a few more roles at other theatres, including as Robert Plushly in his own piece, A Swarry Dansong, a duologue with music by Solomon. He then returned to the Savoy to star as Punka, the Rajah of Chutneypore, in Dance, Desprez, and Solomon's The Nautch Girl. In August 1891, Barrington and Jessie Bond took a leave of absence from that show to tour a series of \\"musical duologues\\" (written by Barrington and composed by Solomon) throughout Britain, returning to the Savoy in November. In 1892, Barrington played the title role of the Reverend William Barlow, in Grundy and Solomon's The Vicar of Bray and then toured with that show.Barrington (1908), p. 88 In September 1892, he created the role of Rupert Vernon in Grundy and Sullivan's Haddon Hall, making a critical splash. For example, The Figaro wrote: \\"Barrington... kept the audience in shouts of laughter the whole time [he was] on the stage.\\" In 1893, he created the role of the Proctor in J. M. Barrie, Arthur Conan Doyle, and Ernest Ford's Jane Annie, which was unsuccessful at the Savoy but ran more successfully on tour. Barrington, a lifelong golf enthusiast, speculated that one reason for the failure of Jane Annie in London was that the game of golf was not yet popular there.Barrington (1908), p. 96 Despite the failure of the piece, Barrington was singled out for critical praise.Walters, p. 19 Barrington next created the role of King Paramount I in Gilbert and Sullivan's Utopia, Limited, opening in October of that year. Barrington's comedy, Bartonmere Towers, was also produced at a matinee at the Savoy in 1893, with Barrington playing Sir James Hanbury. With Ilka P√°lmay in The Grand Duke, 1896 Barrington left the company again when Utopia closed, taking over the role of Dr Montague Brierly in the Hall, Greenbank and Jones musical, A Gaiety Girl (in 1894) produced at Daly's Theatre by George Edwardes and on tour. Next, he appeared in Gilbert and Carr's His Excellency (1894‚Äì95) creating the role of the Regent. The stage was dominated by a heroic-size statue of him in the role.Photo of the statue of Barrington as the Regent from The English Illustrated Magazine, p. 286 (1906, Macmillan), accessed 9 March 2008 Barrington also wrote and directed a one-act operetta, A Knight Errant, with music by Alfred Caldicott, which played as a companion piece with His Excellency at the Lyric Theatre. At Toole's Theatre, he played John Rimple in Thoroughbred, by Ralph R. Lumley, in early 1895. J. L. Toole had originated the role but took ill and was forced to retire.Barrington (1908), pp. 100‚Äì01 Barrington also played in some German Reed Entertainments, including a revival of Happy Arcadia at St. George's Hall in 1895, starring Fanny Holland, and toured with the German Reeds.Barrington (1908), pp. 103‚Äì04 In November 1895, Barrington returned to the Savoy as Pooh-Bah in another revival of The Mikado. In March 1896 he created the role of Ludwig in Gilbert and Sullivan's last opera, The Grand Duke. In his 1908 memoir, Barrington wrote of some difficulty in getting along with his co-star, Ilka P√°lmay, who was cast in the role of Julia.Barrington (1908), p. 105 As usual, the critics were pleased with Barrington, \\"on whom... falls the chief burden of the piece, is intensely funny as Ludwig, more especially in the absurd costume of the second act....\\"The Times review of 9 March 1896 , accessed 28 April 2008 After another revival of The Mikado, Barrington again left the Savoy. =Musical comedy and music hall= Beginning in 1896, Barrington spent ten very successful years under the management of Edwardes at Daly's, first taking over the role of the Marquis Imari in The Geisha (1896), and then creating roles in a number of other Edwardian musical comedy hits, including Marcus Pomponius in A Greek Slave (1898), Yen How in San Toy (1899), The Rajah of Bhong in A Country Girl (1902), and Boobhamba in The Cingalee (1904), among others. Playing Marcus in A Greek Slave, 1898 In these roles, he had more freedom to add \\"gags\\" than Gilbert had given him at the Savoy, and he often wrote topical verses to Adrian Ross's songs. However, Barrington complained that, in these musical comedies, the plot was nearly eliminated during rehearsals.Barrington (1908), pp. 116‚Äì17 During this time, Barrington often reprised his role as the Judge at benefit matinees. Also during this period, several of Barrington's stage works were produced by Arthur Bourchier at the Garrick Theatre, including Barrington's popular children's \\"fairy play\\" called Water Babies, based on Charles Kingsley's 1863 book, with music by Frederick Rosse, Albert Fox and Alfred Cellier (1902). Barrington directed Water Babies. Another Barrington play, Little Black Sambo and Little White Barbara, with music by Wilfred Bendall, enjoyed 31 matinees at the Garrick in 1904. Barrington appeared between 1905 and 1907 in several musical comedies, including The White Chrysanthemum (1905), as Admiral Sir Horatio Armitage, K.C.B. (with Isabel Jay, Louie Pounds and Henry Lytton). He also played Barnabas Goodeve in a revival of the farce The Candidate by Justin Huntly McCarthy at Wyndham's Theatre with Charles Wyndham. He then briefly played his old role in a revival of The Geisha in 1906, after which he created the role of the Pharaoh of Egypt in the successful comic opera Amasis (1906), by Philip Michael Faraday and Frederick Fenn, both in London (where it ran for over 200 performances) and on extended tours.Barrington (1908), chapters XII through XVI During this period, Barrington performed his own solo music hall sketches at the Coliseum and produced various tours, performing standard topical songs of the day, including the only song that he recorded, \\"The Moody Mariner\\" (1905). This was based on a story in Many Cargoes by Jacobs, with lyrics by Barrington and music by Walter Slaughter. Other such sketches and songs included \\"Man the Lifeboat\\" (1907), written by Leedham Bantock (starring also William Terriss)Walters, p. 20 \\"Across the Silent Way\\" and \\"The Tramp\\" by Barrington and Slaughter, and Mummydom (1907), which he had written in 1903 with Wilfrid Bendall (Sullivan's former secretary) based on his play of the same name that had been produced some years earlier at Penley's Theatre.Barrington (1908), p. 207 He also wrote a Rip van Winkle sketch for Courtice Pounds and a one-act musical drama, No. 442, His Escape (1907), with music by H. M. Higgs. Barrington became known for writing topical verses on short notice. In his 1908 memoir, he tells the following story: Helen D'Oyly Carte with Barrington, c. 1908 Barrington returned to the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in 1908 for the second of the London repertory seasons, playing Pooh-Bah, Captain Corcoran, Mountararat, and the Sergeant of Police once again, and adding the roles of Wilfred Shadbolt in Yeomen (finally completing the feat of playing a principal role in all thirteen extant Gilbert and Sullivan operas), and Don Alhambra in The Gondoliers to his Savoy repertoire. He then played in more music hall sketches and toured in musicals, including in A Member of Tattersall's, an adaptation by Adrian Ross of Leo Fall's Die Geschtedene Frau (1909, repeated in London in 1911); as the Marquis of Steyne in The Walls of Jericho (1909); and as Judge Tucker in The Bigamist (1910). In 1910, he created the role of Lucas van Tromp in The Girl in the Train at the Vaudeville Theatre. =Last years= Barrington also established himself on the legitimate stage, playing Falstaff in The Merry Wives of Windsor at His Majesty's Theatre in 1911; he appeared in Baron TrenckWearing, p. 197 and in several other roles from 1911 to 1913; on tour in Other People's Babies, by Lechmere Worrall, in 1913;Cannon, John. \\"Rutland Barrington ‚Äì A Postscript\\", Gilbert and Sullivan News, Vol. 11, No. 14, Spring 1999, pp. 10‚Äì11 as Lord Leonard Alcar in the highly successful The Great Adventure by Arnold Bennett (1913‚Äì14; based on Bennett's 1908 novel, Buried Alive); as Max Somossy in The Joy-Ride Lady, by Arthur Anderson and Hartley Carrick at the New Theatre (1914); and Polonius in Hamlet and Christopher Sly in The Taming of the Shrew at His Majesty's in 1916, among other roles.Profile of Barrington at the \\"Memories of the D'Oyly Carte\\" website, accessed 9 March 2008 He continued to perform in London and in the provinces until 1918, from 1916 under the management of John Martin- Harvey. One of his later successes was a reprise of his 1909 role as the kindly bookmaker Peter Perks in A Member of Tattersall's. His last role was Claus in The Burgomaster of Stilemonde, by Count Maurice Maeterlinck, at the Lyceum Theatre, Edinburgh, beginning in October 1918. Barrington wrote horse racing columns for Punch magazine under the pseudonym Lady Gay and also wrote two volumes of reminiscences, in 1908 and 1911. He also appeared in four silent films: \\"San Toy\\" (1900); as Mr. Texel in \\"The Great Adventure\\" (1915); as Septimus Beaumont in \\"The Girl Who Loves a Soldier\\" (1916); and as Mr. Potter in Still Waters Run Deep (1916). In addition to his avid interest in several sports, which he describes at length in his memoirs, Barrington was a skilled artist in watercolours and pen and ink. After Barrington suffered a paralytic stroke in early 1919, he was unable to perform. He spent the rest of his life in poverty, although his fellow actors held benefits and made other efforts to help him, and his brothers and his neighbours in East Hagbourne, Berkshire, helped him as he became increasingly disabled and eventually unable even to speak. He died in 1922 while living at the St. James's Infirmary, Balham, in South London, at the age of 69 and is buried in Lower Morden Lane at the Morden Cemetery, also known as Battersea New Cemetery, in Surrey. On the 75th anniversary of Barrington's death, a granite monument with a photoplaque of Barrington as Pooh-Bah was dedicated to him at the Morden Cemetery, by members of the Gilbert and Sullivan Society, the Sir Arthur Sullivan Society and others.Jones, Brian. \\"The Rutland Barrington Memorial\\", Gilbert and Sullivan News, March 1987, Vol. 11, No. 8, p. 17, The Gilbert and Sullivan Society, London Notes References Playing King Paramount in Utopia, Limited, 1893  Preface by W.

He represents the moderate wing of the CGT, as opposed to the more radical wing noted in Marseilles' trade union. Bernard Thibault was born on January 2, 1959 in the 6th arrondissement of Paris, from a family hailing from the Morvan area. At the age of 15, he entered the SNCF apprenticeship centre in Noisy-le- Sec, which he left in 1976 with a qualification in general mechanics. He was then hired by the SNCF yard at Paris-la-Villette. In 1977, he joined the Conf√©d√©ration g√©n√©rale du travail, and was put in charge of the union's \\"Young workers commission\\". In 1980, he became secretary of the union in his train yard, and was later elected secretary of the CGT for all rail workers of the Eastern Paris railroad network. During the strikes of Fall 1986, he provided the impetus for the start of the strikes and is credited with forwarding the principle of coordinated strikes, which the unions had until then been reluctant to adopt. He promoted integrating non-unionist strikers into the decision process, which was largely left to general assemblies of workers at the local level (a practice that was repeated during the large 1995 strikes). He was at the time considered one of the main figures of the strike and a symbol of the renewal of the CGT. In 1987, he joined the French Communist Party and, shortly thereafter, the CGT federal office for rail workers. In 1997, he was appointed to the confederal office. During the 46th Congress of the CGT in January‚ÄìFebruary 1999, he succeeded to Louis Viannet as the head of the confederation. He also resigned his national responsibilities in the Communist Party, to fight the idea that the unions were the force driving the party. Thanks to his comparatively young age, and to the economic recovery in France at the end of the 20th century, he managed to counter the sag in CGT members. The internal tensions in the Conf√©d√©ration Fran√ßaise D√©mocratique du Travail brought about by the Fillon retirement law prompted members to switch unions and reinforce the CGT. However, Thibault's efforts to push the CGT towards a more reformist stance, as witnessed for instance during the strikes of November 2007, was met with resistance within the leadership of the union, which for example did not give a voting directive to its members for the 2005 referendum on the European Constitution.

The song was premiered at a secret gig in London on 5 April 2006. \\"Atlantic\\" was featured in the TV series CSI: NY in the eighth episode of the third season \\"Consequences\\".  Composition  \\"Atlantic\\" was composed by Tim Rice-Oxley c. 2005 and recorded at the Helioscentric Studios, Rye, East Sussex and at the Magic Shop, New York City. First demos featured Rice-Oxley instead of Chaplin on the lead vocals. The first verse, lyrically, was different from the final version. Sessions at the Magic Shop for the recording of this song were filmed and released on the Under the Iron Sea DVD. = Musical structure = The song opens without with Rice-Oxley's electric piano instrumentally. After 30 seconds, the bass and drums are added. Chaplin's vocals are then introduced, and the drums drop out for 16 beats. Later on, the song drastically changes its tone to introduce the chorus and the final part. While the album version fades with strings, the video version incorporates the outro of \\"The Iron Sea\\", with electronic sounds including echoes and voices.  Song's meaning  According to Keane.at, \\"This song talks about newly-wed Rice-Oxley feelings about his relationship.\\" Tim also explained this on 22 May 2006:  Music video  The video for \\"Atlantic\\", aired only in Europe, was directed by Scottish novelist Irvine Welsh. It is entirely black and white and starts with scenes of the Atlantic Ocean and a beach in Sussex, and did not feature the band. A long-haired, bearded man with ragged clothes, played by Jonathan Lewis Owen, a business partner of Welsh's, comes out of the ocean and walks quietly along the beach. Firstly, he sees a couple tying a rolled sheet of paper - presumably a message for help - and putting it into a bottle before they throw it to the sea. He stops briefly to watch them, and then continues walking to find a boy kicking a football. The ball rebounds on the cliff and falls into the water; the boy asks the man to fetch it, but he refuses, so the boy kicks him and runs away. When the man recovers he continues walking, and sees a large swimming-costume clad woman, played by Cheryl Fergison, with a life-ring who throws herself to the sea and disappears while the life-ring floats on the waves. The man is shocked, looks around for somebody to help her, sees no one and then walks on. He finds an old man who has a metal detector, and points out a place along the shore and the metal detector finds something in the sand. Digging, they find what seems to be a dead bird. The old man runs away shortly before the main man. When the chorus leads in, the man finds two children building a sand castle, who promptly destroy it upon seeing him. The song ends and a part of the instrumental \\"The Iron Sea\\", comes in as the final scenes show three teenagers throwing two unlit petrol bombs into the sea, and when the man turns around, he faces a pale man with a dark hooded cloak representing Death, or the Grim Reaper, and loses himself in Death's eyes. Immediately, for two seconds every person in the video appears, and in the final shot they all follow Death with linked hands - this bears a resemblance to the final shot of the Swedish film The Seventh Seal.

Flags in the Dust is a novel by the American author William Faulkner, completed in 1927. His publisher heavily edited the manuscript with Faulkner's reluctant consent, removing about 40,000 words in the process. That version was published as Sartoris in 1929.Padgett, John B. \\"Flags in the Dust: Commentary.\\" William Faulkner on the Web, June 26, 2008, accessed 19 April 2011 Faulkner's original manuscript of Flags in the Dust was published in 1973, and Sartoris was subsequently taken out of print. Plot summary The novel deals with the decay of an aristocratic southern family just after the end of World War I. The wealthy Sartoris family of Jefferson, Mississippi, lives under the shadow of its dead patriarch, Colonel John Sartoris. Colonel John was a Confederate cavalry officer during the Civil War, built the local railroad, and is a folk hero. The surviving Sartorises are his younger sister, Virginia Du Pre (\\"Aunt Jenny\\" or \\"Miss Jenny\\"), his son Bayard Sartoris (\\"Old Bayard\\"), and his great-grandson Bayard Sartoris (\\"Young Bayard\\"). The novel begins with the return of young Bayard Sartoris to Jefferson from the First World War. Bayard and his twin brother John, who was killed in action, were fighter pilots. Young Bayard is haunted by the death of his brother. In addition to feeling intense survivor guilt, Bayard senses instinctively that everyone in town liked John better. Both were superb athletes, and fearless fighters, but as Aunt Jenny frequently points out, \\"Johnny\\" Sartoris was friendly, cheerful and good-natured to old and young alike, while Bayard was cold, sullen, and moody even before the war. As a result of all this, Bayard secretly feels that he should have been killed in Johnny's place. That and the family disposition for foolhardy acts push him into a pattern of self- destructive behavior, especially reckless driving in a recently purchased automobile. Eventually young Bayard crashes the car off a bridge. During the convalescence which follows, he establishes a relationship with Narcissa Benbow, whom he marries. Despite promises to Narcissa to stop driving recklessly, he gets into a near wreck with old Bayard in the car, causing old Bayard to die of a heart attack. Young Bayard disappears from Jefferson, leaving his now pregnant wife with Aunt Jenny. He dies test-flying an experimental airplane on the day of his son‚Äôs birth Background In the autumn or winter of 1926, William Faulkner, twenty-nine, began work on the first of his novels about Yoknapatawpha County. Sherwood Anderson had told him some time before that he should write about his native Mississippi, and now Faulkner took that advice: he used his own land, and peopled it with men and women who were partly drawn from real life, and partly depicted as they should have been in some ideal mythopoeic structure. A year later, on September 29, 1927, the new novel was completed. It was 596 pages long in transcript, and he called it Flags in the Dust. Full of enthusiasm, Faulkner sent Flags in the Dust up to Horace Liveright (who had published his first two novels) in New York. Liveright read it, disliked it, and sent it back with his firm recommendation that Faulkner not try to offer it for publication anywhere else: it was too diffuse, too lacking in plot and structure; and, Liveright felt, no amount of revision would be able to salvage it. Faulkner, crushed, showed Flags in the Dust to several of his friends, who shared Liveright's opinion. Despite the adversity Faulkner had faced, he still believed that this would be the book that would make his name as a writer, and for several months he tried to edit it himself, sitting at his worktable in Oxford. Finally, discouraged, he sent a new typescript off to Ben Wasson, his agent in New York. \\"Will you please try to sell this for me?\\" he asked Wasson. \\"I can't afford all the postage it's costing me.\\" In the meantime, convinced that he would never become a successful novelist, Faulkner began to work on a book that he was sure would never mean anything to anyone but himself: The Sound and the Fury. Wasson tried eleven publishers, all of whom rejected Flags in the Dust. Finally he gave the typescript to Harrison Smith, then an editor of Harcourt, Brace & Company. Smith liked it, and showed it to Alfred Harcourt, who agreed to publish it, provided that someone other than Faulkner perform the extensive cutting job that Harcourt felt was necessary. For fifty dollars, Wasson agreed to pare down his client's novel. On September 20, 1928, Faulkner received a contract for the book, now to be called Sartoris (no one knows who changed its name), which was to be about 110,000 words long, and which was to be delivered to Harcourt, Brace sixteen days later. Faulkner left immediately for New York, presumably to help Wasson with his revision. But when he sat down in Wasson's apartment to observe the operation on his novel, Faulkner found himself unable to participate. If it were cut, he felt, it would die. Wasson persisted, however, pointing out that the trouble with Flags in the Dust was that it was not one novel, but six, all struggling along simultaneously. This, to Faulkner, was praise: evidence of fecundity and fullness of vision, evidence that the world of Yoknapatawpha was rich enough to last. As he later wrote of his third novel, \\"I discovered that my own little postage stamp of native soil was worth writing about and that I would never live long enough to exhaust it.\\" Nevertheless, Wasson kept his bargain with Alfred Harcourt. For the next two weeks, while Faulkner sat nearby writing The Sound and the Fury, and Wasson went through the typescript of Flags in the Dust, making cuts of every sort until almost a fourth of the book had been excised. Harcourt, Brace published this truncated version on January 31, 1929, as Sartoris (with a dedication: \\"To Sherwood Anderson through whose kindness I was first published, with a belief that this book will give him no reason to regret that fact\\"), and the old Flags in the Dust was soon forgotten - by everyone but Faulkner. Faulkner had preserved the original holograph manuscript of Flags in the Dust, 237 pages in his neat but minuscule and almost illegible hand; and he had bound together with thin wire the 596 pages of a sort of composite typescript of the novel, produced by the combination of three separate but overlapping typescript drafts. The first of these, 447 pages long, seems to have been begun before he completed his manuscript version. The second, 99 pages of which are in the composite typescript, was probably written after he had completed the manuscript and the first typescript. In the third, 146 pages appear to have been a revision of the second typescript. Why Faulkner should have labored over the reconstruction of his text, is not clear: perhaps he thought of his composite typescript as a working draft which would allow him ultimately to restore to his novel that which Wasson had carved from it - or perhaps, fastidious man that he was, he simply could not bring himself to throw away all of those typed pages. In any case, the manuscript and typescript both were eventually deposited at the Alderman Library of the University of Virginia, where they lay more or less undisturbed until Mrs. Jill Summers, Faulkner's daughter, remembered that her late father had spoken often of a restoration of Flags in the Dust. Mrs. Summers asked Douglas Day and Albert Erskine Jr., editor at Random House, to undertake the task. The result is, now, Flags in the Dust, which aims at being a faithful reproduction of that composite typescript. Certain non-substantive alterations in spelling and punctuation have been made, in order to bring the novel into conformity with Faulkner's other books; but wherever possible his many idiosyncrasies, especially those on which he himself insisted during his years of working with editors at Random House, were allowed to stand. The final complete typescript, which must have served as setting copy for the Harcourt, Brace edition of Sartoris (and which must have been the draft in which Wasson made his cuts), has not survived. Nor have any galley proofs. There was no way, finally, for anyone to tell which of the many differences between Flags in the Dust and Sartoris were the result of Faulkner's emendations in the hypothetical setting copy and the galley proofs, and which belonged to Wasson. Faulkner firmly believed Flags in the Dust was better than Sartoris.

After finishing school, he was immediately recruited in 1985 as a medical reporter for CFCF-TV, the CTV affiliate in Montreal. At CFCF-TV for twelve years, Roberts found himself on a variety of different segments, from travel to morning talk shows. In 1995, a tape of an interview he conducted on his morning TV show Montreal Today With Leslie Roberts landed on the desk of an agent in Los Angeles. Within six months he was offered a position with the TV tabloid show A Current Affair. A year later he moved to Fox as a reporter/anchor for WNYW in New York City. Three years later Roberts answered a call from CFCF-TV to return home as anchor/host of several shows. In 2000, the Global Television Network came calling. He was news director and senior anchor at Global Quebec until Global offered a position on the anchor desk in Toronto. Roberts was the executive editor and anchor for Global Toronto from 2001 to 2015, hosting the station's News Hour from 5:30-6:30 p.m., and co-anchoring Global and Shaw Media's The Morning Show from 2013 until 2015. During those years he also hosted his own radio talk show on CFRB in Toronto, was a daily contributor to talk station AM640 Toronto, and penned his own column, \\"The Five Things I Learned This Week\\" in the National Post. In 2011 and 2013 he was nominated for the Gemini Award/Canadian Screen Awards for Canada's Best News Anchor. Roberts won two CSA's while hosting Focus Ontario. =Global News= In September 2001, Roberts was recruited by CanWest's Toronto division to be a co-anchor with Beverly Thomson of the station's supper time news show.

The coin was created by Laura Gardin Fraser, the first woman credited with designing a coin. Alabama Congressman Lilius Bratton Rainey introduced legislation for a commemorative coin at the request of the state's centennial commission. The bill originally provided for commemorative quarters but was amended to provide for halves instead. The bill moved quickly through the legislative process and became the Act of May 10, 1920, with the signature of President Woodrow Wilson. The half dollars were not issued until October 1921, apparently because the initial decision to depict President Wilson, a Democrat, on the coin might be reversed depending on the results of the 1920 presidential election. After Republican Warren G. Harding won the presidency, the sponsors of the issue chose to depict William Bibb, the State of Alabama's first governor, and Thomas Kilby, its governor at the time of the centennial, thus making Governor Kilby the first living person to appear on a U.S. coin. To boost sales, a symbol, 2X2 (recognizing Alabama as the 22nd state) was included in the design for a minority of the coins; these are generally more expensive today.  Inception  Alabama was admitted to the Union in 1819, and celebrated its centennial in 1919. The Alabama Centennial Commission sponsored local celebrations in the state in 1919 and 1920, but was beginning to wind down its operations before it began the push for a centennial coin. Numismatists Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen later speculated that the members heard of other states which had received or which sought a commemorative coin, and, out of local pride, wanted the same for Alabama. The coin would also help with fundraising, and the proceeds were to be used for \\"historical and monumental\\" purposes. Commission members persuaded local congressman Lilius Bratton Rainey to push for passage of a bill authorizing a coin. In 1920, commemorative coins were not sold by the government‚ÄîCongress, in authorizing legislation, usually designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase them at face value and vend them to the public at a premium. Although not mentioned in the legislation, in the case of the Alabama Centennial half-dollar, the centennial commission was the authorized group.  Legislation  Rainey introduced legislation for an Alabama Centennial half-dollar in the House of Representatives on February 28, 1920, with the bill designated as H.R. 12824. It was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures, of which Indiana Congressman Albert Vestal was the chairman. That committee held hearings on the bill on March 26, 1920, as well as on the coinage proposal that would become the Pilgrim Tercentenary half dollar, with the Alabama coin the first order of business. Congressman Rainey, in his bill, had asked for 100,000 quarter dollars, and while addressing the committee stated that the sole criticism of his coinage proposal in the Alabama press was one article suggesting he should have asked for double the amount. The choice of denomination came as a surprise to committee member William A. Ashbrook of Ohio, a coin collector, who asked why Rainey was not asking for half dollars, as other states had. Rainey was amenable to that, and also accepted Ashbrook's discouragement when the Alabamian wanted to double the authorized number of coins. The committee voted to recommend Rainey's bill, with an amendment to provide for half dollars instead of quarters, and then proceeded to consider the Pilgrim proposal. Vestal had two days previously written to Treasury Secretary David F. Houston about the Pilgrim coin, and Houston responded that while his department had not opposed the Maine Centennial (previously approved by the committee) or Alabama coinage bills, the Treasury had concerns that issuing large numbers of different designs would aid fraudsters. Vestal issued a report on behalf of his committee on March 27, 1920, indicating his committee's support for the Alabama bill once amended, and attaching the note from Secretary Houston. The three coinage bills‚ÄîMaine Centennial, Alabama Centennial, and Pilgrim Tercentenary‚Äîwere considered in that order by the House of Representatives on April 21, 1920. As the Maine piece was considered, Ohio's Warren Gard asked questions about the bill's provisions, though he did not object to its passage. When the Alabama bill came to the floor, Vestal yielded time for a statement in favor from Rainey, which began with a brief explanation of the bill followed by a much longer paean to the glorious history of his home state, and his conclusion drew applause. Gard then questioned Vestal, and learned that another coin, the Pilgrim one, was next on the House's agenda. Gard expressed his concerns about commemorative coins, \\"but for the life of me I can not see what advantage there is for a State celebration to gather up a lot of coins with a particular stamp on them. It seems to me rather to cheapen the national coin. because it looks like an old- fashioned medal at a county fair rather than the half-dollar of the daddies, to use the old expression. I think that these propositions are open to serious objection, which, of course, should be voiced to the Secretary of the Treasury.\\" Vestal agreed to pass on Gard's concerns to Secretary Houston, and the Alabama bill passed without dissent, to be followed by the Pilgrim one, again after questioning from Gard. The following day, April 22, 1920, the House notified the Senate of its passage of the Alabama bill. It was referred to the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency; on April 28, Connecticut's George P. McLean reported it back with a recommendation it pass. On May 3, McLean asked that the three coin bills (Maine, Alabama and Pilgrim) be considered by the Senate immediately, rather than waiting their turns, but Utah Senator Reed Smoot objected: Smoot's attempt to bring up an anti-dumping trade bill had just been objected to by Charles S. Thomas of Colorado. Smoot, however, stated if the bills had not been reached by about 2:00 pm, there would probably not be any objection. When McLean tried again to advance the coin bills, Kansas' Charles Curtis asked if there was any urgency. McLean replied that as the three coin bills were to mark ongoing anniversaries, there was a need to have them authorized and get the production process started. All three bills passed the Senate without opposition and the Alabama bill was enacted with the signature of President Woodrow Wilson on May 10, 1920.  Preparation  The Seal of Alabama as it appeared in 1920 Alabama Governor Thomas Kilby had a three-member commission headed by Marie Bankhead Owen decide what design the state should recommend for the coins, and it solicited proposals from the public, but rejected all submissions. On June 1, 1920, Owen proposed to Kilby that one side have a depiction of the Alabama Capitol building and the other jugate heads of James Monroe (president at the time of Alabama's admission in 1819) and Woodrow Wilson (president in 1919). Kilby sent the proposal, which included rough sketches, to the Director of the Mint, Raymond T. Baker, who forwarded it to the Commission of Fine Arts for its opinion. Its sculptor-member, James Earle Fraser, designer of the Buffalo nickel, disliked the capitol as a subject, feeling that buildings never translated well to coins. When this went back through channels to Owen, her committee reconsidered the building, and on June 24 she wrote to Baker substituting a design based on the Seal of Alabama, focused upon the eagle that was then a part of it, and if that was not acceptable, Owen suggested the design of the half-dollar current in 1819. There the matter rested for an entire year. Swiatek and Breen described the Alabama half-dollar as caught up in the presidential election of 1920, as a Republican administration might not be willing to put the Democrat Wilson on a coin, or might insist on the new incumbent appearing, something likely to dampen sales in Alabama, part of the Democratic Solid South. The Republican, Ohio Senator Warren G. Harding, won the election and was inaugurated in March 1921. On June 29, 1921, Owen wrote to Baker, suggesting a new pair of honorees for the coin: Kilby, the state's chief executive at the time of the 1919 centennial, and the State of Alabama's first governor, William Bibb. Cartoonist Frank Spangler of the Montgomery Advertiser prepared sketches of the new design. At James Fraser's suggestion, the plaster models were created by his wife, Laura Gardin Fraser, who was a noted sculptor in her own right. She shipped her completed work to the Commission of Fine Arts on September 22, 1921, and gained members' approval; the models were then sent to the Philadelphia Mint for use in making coinage dies. Laura Fraser thus became the first woman to design a coin, not only of the U.S., but of any country.  Design  Governor Thomas Kilby The obverse of the coin features jugate busts of Bibb, Alabama's first governor as a state, and the incumbent in 1919, Kilby. In so appearing, Kilby became the first living person depicted on a U.S. coin. Anthony Swiatek, in his volume on commemoratives, averred that the issuance was not controversial at the time, as the Act of May 16, 1866, that forbids the depiction of living people on currency was deemed to refer to paper money only, but Q. David Bowers wrote that the portrayal caused contemporary comment, for the position of the federal government (excepting some paper money issues of the 19th century) was that living people should not appear on U.S. money. A total of 22 stars flank the busts, symbolic of Alabama being the 22nd state; a message reinforced on those pieces bearing the inscription 2X2 in the obverse field. The X in that inscription alludes to the St. Andrew's cross on the flag of Alabama. The date, the names of the governors, and various other wordings appear towards the rim of the obverse. The reverse features an eagle, possessing arrows and a shield, but no olive branch to symbolically counter the instruments of war; matched branches and arrows are often present in heraldic depiction of eagles on coins. The eagle's beak holds an end of a ribbon on which is inscribed the Alabama state motto, \\"HERE WE REST\\" about which Swiatek and Breen, in their 1988 book jibed, \\"no pun intended about the sleepy Deep South\\". Bowers complained that the centennial dates on the reverse, plus the 1921 for the year of striking, lead to \\"a bewildering confusion of dates to the casual observer\\". Numismatic historian Don Taxay deemed the half-dollar \\"one of the most successful portrait coins in the commemorative series. The heads of Bibb and Kilby are true, and yet contain more than a touch of the ideal. They are beautifully related to each other. The eagle is equally fine\\". Art historian Cornelius Vermeule considered the Alabama coin \\"a good example of the trite motifs, partly real and partly symbolic, that go into one of these statehood commemoratives\\". He suggested that the use of the jugate portraits \\"recall that this classical device was first revived in American coinage on the Washington-Lafayette silver dollar of 1900.\\" Vermeule concluded that \\"vigorous lettering has saved uninteresting portraits from weakening the reverse and the defiant eagle of the obverse is handled in a spirit worthy of Saint-Gaudens.\\"  Production, distribution, and collecting  President Warren G. Harding addresses a segregated crowd in Birmingham, October 26, 1921, the first day of the coin's distribution James Fraser had suggested to Fine Arts Commission chairman Moore that the Alabama committee be told that the Missouri Centennial half dollar issuers were having \\"2‚òÖ4\\" placed on some of their coins, symbolizing Missouri being the 24th state and creating a second variety for collectors to obtain. Owen already knew of this, and \\"2X2\\" was placed on the obverse. A total of 6,006 half dollars was struck in October 1921, with six of them placed aside at Philadelphia for inspection and testing at the 1922 meeting of the annual Assay Commission. Alabama half dollars were first placed on sale on October 26, 1921, the day of President Harding's visit to Birmingham, Alabama, where he as a Mason laid the cornerstone for the city's new Masonic temple, and as president addressed a segregated crowd, urging improvement of race relations. Coins were sold from specially-built booths constructed just off the city's sidewalks. It is uncertain whether these coins bore the 2X2 or not. Official records show that all the coins struck in October were of the 2X2 variety, and this was long accepted by numismatic historians. However, one coin collector recalled buying two of the half dollars that day, and over fifty later, all of the plain variety, and averred that none of the 2X2 could have been sold in Birmingham on the first day. As Owen wrote that the first 5,000 received bore the mark, Swiatek concluded that 1,000 of the October mintage was of the plain variety, all that was for sale in Birmingham. In December, 64,038 more were minted, with 38 set aside for assay. These were recorded to be of the plain variety. Both 2X2 and plain coins were struck from the same die; the mark was ground off to allow coinage of plain pieces. Both varieties were sold by the centennial commission for $1, and primarily went to citizens of Alabama; banks throughout the state vended them. When they could not be sold, 5,000 of the plain variety were returned to the Mint and melted. Although the 2X2 coins are only a tenth of the total mintage, they are considerably more common than that, as people were aware of their scarcity, with more saved and fewer spent in hard times. Bowers suggested that the mintage figures may be incorrect, and the 2X2 nearly as common as the plain variety. According to the deluxe edition of R. S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins published in 2015, the Alabama half lists for between $85 and $650 without 2X2 and between $170 and $850 with, dependent on condition. A specimen of the plain in exceptional condition sold for $7,344 in 2014.

Biography Born in Manhattan, he was the son of Yiddish theatre comic Bessie Zwerling. While in his 20s, he was one of the orchestrators for George Gershwin's Broadway musical Girl Crazy, became singer Helen Morgan's accompanist, and later worked as pianist and arranger for singer Rudy Vallee. He began working in Hollywood in 1933, arranging for Al Jolson at Warner Bros., Alice Faye at 20th Century-Fox and Bing Crosby at Paramount. He orchestrated the original version of Irving Berlin's White Christmas for the film Holiday Inn (1942), and from 1942 to 1946 he served as head of music for Republic Pictures. From 1948 to 1954, Scharf was arranger-conductor for the Phil Harris-Alice Faye radio show. A ten-time Oscar nominee, Scharf worked on more than 100 films, receiving nominations for his musical direction on such pictures as Danny Kaye's Hans Christian Andersen (1952), Barbra Streisand's Funny Girl (1968) and Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971). In the early 1960s, he was approached by Harold Lloyd to provide new scores for his silent film compilations. Lloyd regarded Scharf's ability to mix comedy themes with big, dramatic orchestral touches as ideal for his brand of 'thrill' comedy. Scharf implemented a similar style for the Jerry Lewis Jekyll and Hyde- inspired comedy The Nutty Professor in (1963), working on more than a dozen Lewis comedies overall.

It is a complete grade 8‚Äì12 high school program. It is generally accepted as the \\"steward school\\" of Sir Winston Churchill Secondary, although was run independently under the leadership of head teacher Jim King, who retired and was replaced by Ernie Pao in September 2014. Entrance An English and cognitive skills test is taken by prospective students as part of the application process. Community service, marks, and extra-curriculars are also considered for entrance. Interviews with the students narrow down applicants further. Program Other than for its size, Ideal differs from Churchill Secondary because of its enriched approach to learning. It offers an intimate and creative environment, and utilizes an informal, unique teaching style where the teachers are addressed by their first names and trust is highly regarded. Integration among grades, expression and leadership are extremely common and promoted with \\"school meetings\\". There are six classrooms in the school, which is currently attended by approximately 125 students from Grade 8 to 12. Students at Ideal may join sports teams at Churchill Secondary, as well as clubs, and elective classes in Grade 11 and 12. Since 2008, Ideal has been holding an annual science fair. As of late 2009, Ideal features an advanced Moodle course management system that provides students access to online learning discussions and resources. History Ideal School was established in 1972 by teacher Garry Nixon, who was teaching at St. George's School at the time. It was intended to be an independent, alternative high school. The Province reported that \\"[t]o be admitted, boys and girls must convince Nixon they sincerely want to learn and are willing to work harder than would be required in other schools\\", and that it would cost $60 a month in fees. Nixon published a job posting in The Vancouver Sun, promising prospective teachers \\"freedom, fascination and abject poverty\\". Six teachers comprised the original staff, chosen from a pool of over 60 applicants, and with much lower salaries than what could be expected at a public school. Ideal School was originally housed in the Vancouver Fancy Sausage Factory, on 16th Avenue and Heather Street. The blood gutters had to be cleaned out before the staff and students could move in. Faced with financial difficulties, in 1974 the school approached the Vancouver School Board for economic support. Sir William Dawson School circa 1920 1974 newspaper ad Once absorbed by the Vancouver School Board, the tuition was removed and teacher salaries were increased. It was temporarily relocated to Sir William Dawson School on Helmcken Street (which closed in 1972, and was used by Ideal and City School, another alternative program, from 1974 to 1977). It was placed under the administration of King George Secondary School, and prospered for two years with help from the school board, which advertised for it to maintain enrolment, reportedly spending approximately $1,700 between 1974 and 1977. In November 1975, a research report released by a member of the Board of School Trustees reported around 100 students and five teachers. It claimed that the students benefited from their experience at Ideal due to freedom to participate in school decisions, dedicated teachers, and low student‚Äìteacher ratio, while criticizing the building and the lack of facilities and equipment. Lord Byng Secondary School On April 21, 1976, the school board stated that Ideal was to be moved to Lord Byng Secondary School. A parent‚Äìstudent committee was formed to discuss the situation, which presented arguments against the move to the school board, claiming that its independence was necessary to maintain students' individuality and creativity. The committee succeeded in convincing the board to withdraw its decision. On October 4, 1976, a board official stated that the move to Lord Byng was being reconsidered, but the committee succeeded once more in convincing the board against the relocation. However, on December 6, 1976, the board announced their irreversible decision to perform the move before February 1, 1977, as the Dawson School building was considered to be expensive to maintain. Ideal School was to occupy three classrooms at Byng, and students were told that they could either accept the move or be dispersed among Vancouver high schools. On January 4, 1977, Ideal students protested in front of the Vancouver School Board. It was agreed that the school board would assess Ideal's situation at Lord Byng for six months, and if the accommodation was deemed inadequate, it would be relocated again. Lord Byng and Ideal did not co-exist well, and parents and students wrote complaint letters to the media. Relocation to the former site of L'√âcole Bilingue Elementary in Shannon Park was considered, but residents of the area disapproved of the presence of a secondary school. Eventually, Ideal was relocated to 855 West 59th Avenue. In 1995, Ideal Mini School came in first in British Columbia provincial exam results for English 12 and second (the first being University Hill Secondary School) in English Literature 12. Vancouver School Board budget cuts in 2010 threatened mini schools, including Ideal, resulting in student protests.

A total of two were built. Gelbke, who had attended engineering school in Wisconsin and at University of Southern California, had worked for McDonnell Douglas and also owned two motorcycle shops in Chicago and Hammond, Indiana. He wanted to create a motorcycle that was dependable and was able to cruise at highway speeds comfortably for long periods. Gelbe constructed and welded the frame himself using 4130 chrome- molybdenum tubing, and equipped the machine with a Chevrolet 153 engine and GM powerglide transmission. The shaft drive was constructed from a Chevrolet 1-ton truck differential that was cut in half. The complete bike is long and weighs . Its great size and weight make the bike impossible for most people to steer until it is moving at a speed of at least , and when at rest it is held up by hydraulic rams that are deployed by the driver. Gelbke was known for riding the bike up and down Cicero Avenue and Addison Street in Chicago in the 1960s, and he made regular cross-country trips on it from 1966 through 1978, logging over 20,000 miles in one year. When Gelbe died in 1978, the bikes were put into storage. Posters depicting Gelbke on a Roadog were a popular item among classic motorcycle enthusiasts; in the mid 1980s, motorcycle enthusiast and swap meet organizer Buzz Walneck began searching for the motorcycle, finally placing an ad in his monthly magazine Walneck's Classic Cycle Trader, receiving a tip and discovering a bike at the home of Gelbke's mother. He purchased it and has displayed it at his swap meets and motorcycle shows. Walnek later sold his bike to the National Motorcycle Museum, where it is on display.http://www.nationalmcmuseum.org/roadog-lives-at-the-national- motorcycle-museum/ The other Roadog is privately owned by a Wisconsin man named Anthony Shablak, who \\"bought it to ride it\\" but has been unable to find an insurer to cover it.

Biography Collier was born in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California and attended Hollywood Progressive School. He grew up in Burbank and attended the University of California, Berkeley, earning a B.A. in English in 1961 and a M.A. in 1963. He served as a civil rights activist in the South in 1964. Returning to California, Collier taught Freshman English at UC Berkeley from 1964 to 1969 and again as a Visiting Writer from 1977-81. He also taught at UC Santa Cruz and at Miles College in Birmingham, Alabama. Collier is a fellow of the National Endowment of the Arts (1980).

Collier was teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1966 when he became an editor at radical Leftist Ramparts magazine, the splashy, four-color publication that was influential in transmitting New Left ideas into the mainstream. Collier wrote about the Black Panthers, the American Indian Movement and other radical organizations for Ramparts. He edited Ramparts until 1972. As the Vietnam War came to an end, he and fellow Ramparts writer David Horowitz became disillusioned when the New Left turned a blind eye to the atrocities committed by the communist victors in Southeast Asia‚Äîthe tiger cages and boat people in South Vietnam, the genocide in Cambodia. They began a slow motion political transition that led them away from the Left and ultimately made them, in their own term, \\"second thoughters\\" engaged in ongoing political combat with their former comrades. Collier and Horowitz traveled to Nicaragua in 1987 at the invitation of the State Department to encourage the \\"civic resistance\\" against the Sandinistas. The same year they organized a \\"Second Thoughts Convention\\" in Washington D.C. Their book about leaving the Left and becoming its enemies, Destructive Generation (1989), was compared to Whittaker Chambers' Witness. He served as a co-author with Horowitz on several books on American history and political science. Their biographies The Rockefellers: An American Dynasty (1976) and The Kennedys: An American Drama (1984) both made the New York Times Best Seller list.

Although \\"muk\\" means \\"jelly\\", when used without qualifiers, it usually refers to dotorimuk. The practice of making dotorimuk originated in mountainous areas of ancient Korea, when abundant oak trees produced enough acorns each autumn to become a viable source of food. Production Despite being a rich source of starch and proteins, acorns contain large amounts of tannins and other polyphenols, which prevent the human body from digesting them properly. Harvested acorns must be properly leached of the tannins prior to consumption. Acorns are either collected directly from the ground or knocked off the tree branches. The acorns are opened and the nutmeat ground into a fine orange-brown paste. The paste is then stirred into vats of water and the acorns' fiber is separated from the starch through sieving and settling. The starch-water mixture is collected and allowed to sit so that the tannins in the starch diffuse into the water, which is changed several times. The overall soaking time depends on the amount of tannins in the paste. The now-tannin-free starch-water suspension should have an off-white colour. This starch is allowed to completely settle at the bottom of the vat, the water drained away and the paste collected in trays to dry. The dried starch cake is then pulverized and packaged for sale. Dotorimuk is also commercially available in powdered form, which must be mixed with water, boiled until pudding-like in consistency, then set in a flat dish.  Serving  Like other muk, dotorimuk is most commonly eaten in the form of dotorimuk muchim (ÎèÑÌÜ†Î¶¨Î¨µÎ¨¥Ïπ®), a side dish in which small chunks of dotorimuk are seasoned and mixed with other ingredients such as slivered carrots and scallions, garlic, soy sauce, sesame oil, red chili pepper powder, and sesame seeds.

Civil service career When Nitiphumthanat returned to Thailand from Australia, he served for the Cooperative Promotion Department on the Thai- Cambodian border before establishing Balance Tutor Moo, a private tutoring school, in Bangkok. In 1985 he became 2nd Lieutenant in the Border Patrol Police operating on the Thai-Myanmar border. In 1991 he was offered a scholarship in the Soviet Union to pursue his doctorate degree and he later resigned from the Royal Thai Police with the rank of Captain. Teaching and inspirational speaking  In 1982 Nitiphumthanat founded a Tutoring School named, Balance Tutor Moo,Balance Tutor Moo which quickly became one of the most popular Tutor Schools at that time. From 1982 till now there have been in excess of 100,000 students who have enrolled for courses. Nitiphumthanat was also the Director of Asian and African Studies, Martin de Tours School of Management and Economic at Assumption University of Thailand Assumption University from 9 August 2003 ‚Äì 31 May 2015. When time permitted, he also accepted public speaking engagements in every province in Thailand. Mass media figure  In 1996 Mr Saengchai Sunthornwat, the International Affairs columnist of Thai Rath newspaper was murdered. At that time he was the most popular columnist in Thailand and the \\"magnet\\" of the newspaper which had a circulation of more than one million. The public eagerly awaited the appointment of Saengchai's successor and after a nine-month hiatus, Nitiphumthanat was offered and accepted the position as Thai Rath's new International Affairs columnist,Perd Fah Song Lok a job he has now held for more than twenty years. In 2001,he became the owner and M.C.of Perd Lens Song Lok (Open Lens Look at the World) a documentary program of travels from over 100 countries that is broadcast on Channel 3. These documentaries have opened trade and investment in Thailand and have received many media awards. Political career Nitiphum in parliament In 2006, Nitiphumthanat ran for the Senatorial Election in Bangkok. He received the most votes amongst the candidates. Mr Samak Sundaravej, who later became Prime Minister of Thailand came in second. The former Speaker of the Parliament and other Ministers also received fewer votes than Nitiphumthanat. Even though he received the highest number of votes in the Kingdom, he was unable to take up his position because of the 2006 army coup d'√©tat. After the coup, Nitiphumthanat was appointed by the King, on the advice of the Council of National Security to the National Legislative Assembly (NLA). He served in many important positions in the Assembly. In 2008 Nitiphumthanat was the Party Leader of the Suvarnabhumi Party for 1 year. When he resigned from the leadership, the Party stopped all activities. In 2011 he was invited to join the Pheu Thai Party and was elected as an M.P. During his term,List of MPs elected in the Thai general election, 2011 he served as the First Deputy Chair on the House Committee on Land, Natural Resources and Environment. Later he was elected by the House Members as a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. He served there until the Prime Minister, Ms.Yingluck Shinawatra, dissolved the Parliament on 9 December 2013. In January 2014, Nitiphumthanat ran for Bangkok Constituency 21 (Sapansoong District and a portion of Pravet District). The results of the 2 February 2014 general election gave him a conclusive win over the other seven candidates from various Parties. The Constitutional Court voided the elections for the whole country so he was unable to take his place. The country's political and economic stability was then disrupted by fighting between the so-called Red Shirts and Yellow Shirts which later developed into ongoing clashes between supporters of the exiled former Prime Minister Taksin Shinawatra and the anti- Taksin group calling themselves the People's Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC). To avoid this political impasse, on 7 May 2014, Nitiphumthanat was ordained as a monk and spent one month at Wat Bowonniwet Vihara, before traveling to India and Nepal. On 22 May 2014, on his return from India to Thailand, he was informed that there had been a military coup d'√©tat and he was ordered to leave the monkhood and report to the National Council for Peace and Order to be detained. He declined and the army, unwilling to provoke resistance from the temple, allowed him to return to Wat Bowonniwet Vihara on condition that he refrained from public activities and reported to and got permission from the Chief of the National Council if he wanted to leave the country. He has now left the monkhood and returned to civilian life. After Nitiphumthanat's political career had been cut short on two separate occasions by coups d'√©tat, he became disillusioned by the Thai political process. This has renewed his enthusiasm to spearhead socially and environmentally responsible businesses to bring about meaningful and sustainable change. He has joined with colleagues to form Balance Group GlobalBalance Group Global in order to further this vision for agricultural services development and promotion of the gemstone industry in Thailand. Business Activities In the bestselling autobiography \\"A Boy from Khao Saming\\" Chapter 6, Page 67 to 85, Nitiphimthanat tells the story of the economic scarcity in his early life which prompted him to dig for Siamese rubies near the Thai-Cambodian border on weekends and school holidays. During this period he started to acquire knowledge of gemstones and their importance to the Thai economy. Later in life, he traveled extensively filming his well-known travel documentaries and searching for gemstones on every continent. He used to be known for having the largest private collection of raw gemstones in the country and in 2003 he was elected to be the Vice President of the famous Thai Gem and Jewelry Manufacturers Association and reelected to serve many terms of office. His company Srithepnavaratna used to be based at the Jewelry Trade Center on Silom Road in the Bangkok Business District, but the company ceased trading during a prolonged period of economic recession. With the proliferation of social media, he and his family have now revitalized their business interests and are trading in gemstones and jewelry via the internet. He is also the Founder and Chairman of the Guild of Thai Online Gems and Jewellery Manufacturers and Traders (GTOGJMT).

Kreis has been a member of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), the Posse Comitatus, and the Aryan Nations. Biography Before joining racist groups, Kreis dropped out of a Newark, New Jersey high school. It was during his high school days that he became interested and active in the white supremacist movement. He served in the U.S. Navy for nine months, but was discharged early \\"based on a determination that he was not suited for military service.\\" He then spent 13 years as a member of the KKK and eventually became a Klan leader. He joined the Posse Comitatus in the late 1980s. In 1994 and 1995 Kreis and his two daughters appeared on The Jerry Springer Show. On one episode show host Jerry Springer kicked Kreis off his show after he made threats and suggested that Springer's mother was a lampshade in the trunk of Kreis' car.\\"Racist Kids,\\" The Jerry Springer Show, 4 Feb. 1993 and \\"A Racist Family\\", The Jerry Springer Show, 20 Feb. 1991 In 1999 Kreis joined the Aryan Nations.\\"Posse leader joins Aryan World Congress,\\" Spokane Spokesman-Review July 15, 2000 After the death of Aryan Nations leader Richard Girnt Butler, in a power struggle, Kreis assumed leadership positions within the Aryan Nations, which caused a split within the organization. Kreis was locally known for harassing neighbors and townspeople with whom he disagreed. Police lodged numerous charges against him, but he was never convicted of any of them. In 2005 he received media attention by seeking an Aryan Nations-al Qaeda alliance. CNN reported that \\"So while August Kreis may be calling, there is no sign that al Qaeda is listening.\\" His statements raised federal concerns about violations of the law which caused the government to look closely at his activities and finances. The federal government concluded that he had no link with any terrorist organization. The government, however, in the process discovered ‚Äúsubstantial unreported funds‚Äù going into his bank accounts with more than $33,000 in unreported income in 2005. Although Kreis only spent a short time in the Navy, he served during wartime and as a result, he received an ‚Äúimproved pension‚Äù based on financial need, which is adjusted based on income. In 2009, he moved from Potter County, Pennsylvania to Lexington, South Carolina, near Columbia, South Carolina. In June 2011, Kreis was arrested in Obion County, Tennessee on \\"felony charges for filing fraudulent statements in an effort to obtain veterans benefits.\\" According to the U.S. Attorney's Office, \\"The indictment alleges that Kreis provided false information about whether he had any income in reports that he submitted to the Department of Veterans Affairs.\\" He had refused to surrender when the charges were filed. He was held in a federal detention center. In August 2011, he pleaded guilty to lying to Veterans Administration officials in order to get pension money which he was not entitled to receive, and he faced a possible sentence of five years in prison and a fine of $250,000. In December 2011, he was sentenced to six months in jail. He ultimately served six months of home arrest followed by two years of probation and was required to pay back the nearly $193,000 of improperly received benefits. In early 2012, he quit the Aryan Nations while he was in prison, passing leadership of the organization to Drew Bostwick. On February 19, 2014, Kreis was arrested on six counts of sexual abuse of children in Richland County, South Carolina. On November 5, 2015, a Lexington County, South Carolina judge sentenced Kreis to 50 years in prison for child molestation. After a three-day trial, a Lexington County jury found Kreis, age 61, guilty of one count of criminal sexual conduct involving a minor child and two counts of committing lewd acts on a child. Kreis was sentenced to serve two 15-year sentences and one 20-year sentence, all to run consecutively. During his sentencing, he held up a sign urging people to vote for Donald Trump for president. This prompted the attorney for Kreis to ask for a mistrial, but the judge rejected the request and instead instructed the jury to focus on the evidence.

July 17, 1907 ‚Äì December 9, 1995) was an Italian- American photographer often associated with the Futurist movement. Early years Born in Fara Filiorum Petri, Chieti, Italy, in 1907, Antonelli arrived in Philadelphia with his family when he was fourteen. His father, a cabinet maker working for the Victor company, died when he was seventeen. Antonelli left school to support the family. In the evenings he attended classes at the Graphic Sketch Club in Philadelphia. In 1925 he opened his own studio in Philadelphia. He received international acclaim during the late 1920s and early 1930s. Antonelli's photographs received top awards at major shows in Paris, London, Barcelona, Rotterdam, Brussels, Rome, and Tokyo. Considered a major \\"futurist\\" artist and photographer, as well as a \\"photo-picturalist\\", he built his international reputation and career on his imaginative portrayals of the human figure and face, works that range from playful to provocative; he was also renowned for his industrial and commercial art. Community leader Antonelli was a legendary figure in the history of the Philadelphia Italian- American community, enhancing the Italian contribution to American culture and enriching the history of photography in Philadelphia. He was active in several Italian-American organizations, such as Order Sons of Italy in America and the America-Italy Society of Philadelphia. He was one of the founding members of The Da Vinci Art Alliance located and still active in Philadelphia. In 1938 he founded the Antonelli School of Photography, later known as the Antonelli Institute Graphic Art & Photography, to train professional photographers. It proved especially popular among World War II veterans seeking training in photography. He served as its president until 1974. A few years later, the school earned national accreditation, and in 1984, it added its graphic design degree program. In 1996 it moved to Erdenheim, Pennsylvania. In July 2017, the president of the Antonelli Institute announced that the institute will close down in 2018, due to ‚Äùuncertainties surrounding our future location and changes in the external environment‚Äù. Much of Antonelli Institute equipment's was donated to Harcum College, which also attracted some of its former staff, as part of a plan for two new degree programs - Digital Design and Photography - which will continue \\"Antonelli's legacy of providing outstanding arts education\\". Exhibitions Severo Antonelli's work was featured (twice) in what remains the largest one-man photography exhibits ever held at the Smithsonian Institution. In 1985, Woodmere Art Museum held a retrospective of his work. Antonelli was a long-time supporter of Woodmere and in 1986 he donated more than one hundred of his photographs to the Museum, many of which are part of the permanent collection. He also donated a large sum of money to the Museum for renovations in 1987. Marriage and Death In 1985, nearly eighty years old, Antonelli married Kay McNulty, one of the first computer programmers. They enjoyed nearly nine years of marriage before he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. He died in 1995, just before their tenth wedding anniversary. Severo is a first cousin of retired Major League Baseball pitcher, Johnny Antonelli.

(2003) \\"The Karelia\\", in The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, Their sound has been described as \\"prog/techno rock with Iggy-voxed overtones\\", and \\"jazzy film-noir lo-fi\\". The band's only album, Divorce At High Noon, was released in 1997 on Sum Records to little acclaim. Produced by Bid of The Monochrome Set, it was an off the wall mix of rock and jazz trumpet with unusual lyrics. The final song, \\"Garavurghty Butes\\", was completely freestyle with improvised lyrics and musical arrangement. The band did not tour and were unknown outside Glasgow. Very few copies of the album sold (literally hundreds) and the band split in 1998 after contributing to an EP for the Guided Missile label. Upon the success of Franz Ferdinand, fans began to exchange originals of Divorce at High Noon for ¬£50-¬£100. Because of this, the album was re-released in February 2005. It featured all of the previous album and two bonus tracks. The band's name derives from the Greek tobacco company Karelia.

It was a merger of two weekly papers: the Manatee River Journal, which had published since the 1880s, and The Bradentown Herald Weekly. The newspaper was at No. 414 Pine Street in downtown Bradenton; the phone number, 28. In the mid-1920s, Pine Street was renamed and the newspaper's home was at 401 13th St. W. (It would remain there until July 1984, when it moved to its present home at 102 Manatee Ave. W.) The Evening Herald was published Monday through Saturday until 1926, when the Saturday publication was replaced by a Sunday edition and the name was changed to The Bradenton Herald. In 1953 the Saturday edition resumed. * 1925: Co-owners Raymond P. Sponenbarger and Robert W. Bentley sold the paper to the R.W. Page Corp. of Columbus, Ga. Alvah H. Chapman Sr. became publisher and served in that capacity until 1937 when W. E. Page Sr., the company's president, was killed in a car accident en route to Bradenton from Columbus. Chapman then became president of the Page Corp. and moved to Columbus with his family. His son, Alvah H. Chapman Jr., would follow in his father's footsteps and retired in 1989 as chairman of Knight-Ridder Inc., which was then the publisher of The Bradenton Herald. The Page Corp. had become part of Knight Newspapers Inc. in 1973; Knight Newspapers and Ridder Publications Inc. merged in 1974 and the Herald became a KR paper. * 2006: The Bradenton Herald was sold as one of the newspapers included in the sale of Knight Ridder newspapers to The McClatchy Company, based in Sacramento, Calif. From its modest beginnings in 1922 as The Evening Herald, The Bradenton Herald has grown and changed along with its community. The Herald shed its \\"evening\\" past on Jan. 1, 1983, when it became a morning publication. The next year, it moved from its cramped, old downtown building to an 87,000-square-foot building, where it also shed its aging Linotype machines for offset printing. It published its last edition on 13th Street on July 7, 1984, and its first edition on Manatee Avenue on July 8, 1984. The Herald entered cyberspace in January 1996 when its website, www.Bradenton.com, was launched as Bradenton Herald Internet Plus (BHIP). * December 2012: The Bradenton Herald online edition went behind a paywall. Currently subscribers can get unlimited access for 99 cents for a trial month and under $7 a month after that. * September 2013: The Bradenton Herald moved to its new headquarters in the heart of downtown Bradenton, 1111 Third Ave. W. * May 2016: The Bradenton Herald discontinued production of its zoned edition, The Lakewood Ranch Herald. The Lakewood Ranch Herald focused on local coverage of the rapidly growing eastern region of Manatee County since 2006.

Like most of Bellow's other works, More Die of Heartbreak is grounded more in the development of character than in the growth of action. Among its themes are the difficulties of reconciling one's ideals with \\"the actual\\" and the difficulties of relating to parents and to mortality. The protagonist of the novel, Kenneth Trachtenberg, is an intellectually gifted and philosophically tortured man attempting to work out his fate and worldview. Plot summary The book opens with an introduction of characters, and with Trachtenberg, the narrator, describing his complex relationship with his maternal uncle, Benn Crader, a world-renowned botanist. He then discusses the distinctions between himself, and his father, a man who, as he describes him, ‚Äú[puts] on the kind of sex display you see in nature films, the courting behavior of turkey cocks or any of the leggier birds‚Ä¶ Dad was a hit with women.‚Äù This theme continues throughout the book, with Kenneth accepting his difficulties with women. He also introduces his mother, a woman who allowed her husband to step out, and only left after realizing that he did not understand what made her happy. She wanted intellectual stimulation of a literary style, whereas he bought her materialistic goods to make up for his infidelities. To atone for receiving the goods she did not need, Kenneth's mother is now living among refugees in Africa. Kenneth then embarks on an overview of Benn's recent sexual history. He presents a man who, while appreciative of beauty and women, is not quite rooted enough in human society to understand the sexual pretexts he encounters. One incident is discussed many times during the novel: a middle aged neighbor of Benn's, an attractive professional who has a slight drinking problem, asks Benn to help her change a light bulb, a not too subtle hint which Benn ignores until she makes a move. The next day, when he shows no interest, and expresses regret for the act, she exclaims, ‚ÄúWhat am I supposed to do with my sexuality?‚Äù Benn then attracts the attentions of another older woman, Caroline who is controlling, indifferent, and loving all at the same time. While Benn, unbeknownst to Kenneth, is dealing with a planned wedding to Caroline, the protagonist is in Seattle to discuss with his ex-girlfriend, Treckie, what they should do about raising their child, now three years old. Treckie, a beautiful, half-sized woman, has been seeing another man, a fact Kenneth knows because of the bruises on her legs - lovemaking injuries he refused to ever give her. Kenneth has discussed this peculiar fetish with his father, who knows women, and received the knowledge that some smaller women must do it to show they are women, and not fully matured girls, the perception they give off. Benn, escaping from the wedding to Caroline, flies to Kyoto at the expense of a lecture series, inviting Kenneth to join him. The Japanese sense of order and utility appeals to Benn, until a strip show he sees at the insistence of his colleagues upsets him with its overt sexuality, at which point, he and Kenneth return to their home in the Midwest. Benn's next partner is Matilda Layamon, a beautiful, Midwestern daughter, who wants to settle down with a distinguished, older man who can calm her wild side. Benn, perhaps fearing that Kenneth will convince him that it is a foolhardy idea, weds her without ‚ÄúKenneth‚Äôs permission.‚Äù Matilda's father is a rectangular man with sharp, thin shoulders who is a doctor, and in fact, asks that he be called, ‚ÄúDoctor.‚Äù He serves the rich, and because of this, has one-percentage point interests in many businesses around the country - an accidental fortune. He is a scheming man, and other than a few disagreements between Benn, and the man, no conflicts occur until he attempts to take advantage of Benn's uncle, a man who, as executor of the will of the Crader mother, undersold, and unfairly bought the Crader home, selling the land to a company which built a tower there, resulting in millions of dollars of profit for Uncle Vilitzer, and pennies for the Crader children. Because Vilitzer controlled the judge, neither Benn nor Kenneth's mother received their fair share, and the Doctor hopes to correct this, so that Matilda will have a rich husband. In the end, Vilitzer dies after a heated discussion with Kenneth and Benn, and Benn, attending the funeral, sends his wife ahead to their honeymoon, and changes his ticket for the North Pole. He relays this to Kenneth who now lives in Benn's apartment, and who has recently returned from a successful bid to Treckie that he have his daughter for a part of the year. He is aware of her impending marriage thanks to a self-expedient phone call that revealed this information. The book ends with a conversation between the two professors in which both stories are relayed to each other.

The dish is a meat stew traditionally made from goat meat, but occasionally made from beef or mutton. The dish is often served at celebratory occasions, such as weddings and baptisms, and holidays, such as Christmas and Easter.

Its operation began in January 2007. The Authority consists of two regional levee boards which oversee flood protection in the Greater New Orleans area on the east and west banks of the Mississippi River. Commissioners of both Authorities have clearly defined term limits. The Authority also has a Nominating Committee. At that time, levee boards still existing were: Algiers), the East Jefferson (Parish) Levee District, the Lake Borgne Basin Levee District (St. Bernard Parish), the St. Tammany (Parish) Levee District, the Tangipihoa (Parish) Levee District, and levee boards for the east banks of St. John the Baptist and St. Charles Parishes. The several pre-existing boards, while subservient to the SLFPA, remained in operation until existing projects, bonds, and tax millage rates either are consolidated under the new board or expire. Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority - East The SLFPA-East consists of nine members, all of whom are appointed by the Governor of Louisiana from nominations provided by a blue-ribbon nominating committee. The nominating committee by statute consists of representatives of universities, national professional associations, and local civic groups. At least five members of the board are required to be engineers in geologically-relevant fields, such as hydrology. One member must be a civil engineer, and another member must be a geologist. The enabling statute stipulates that the SLFPA- East Board be composed of eleven members, one from each parish within the territorial jurisdiction of the authority. In February 2014, State Senators Donahue and Nevers, together with State Representatives Cromer, Burns, Hollis, Pearson, Ritchie, and Simon, pre-filed Senate Bill # 342 to make St Tammany Parish independent of SLFPA- East.http://www.theneworleansadvocate.com/news/8505495-171/st-tammany- officials-want-independent Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority - West The SLFPA-West board is composed of seven members, two from each parish within the territorial jurisdiction of the authority. Members are appointed by the governor from nominations submitted by the nominating committee. Three members are engineers or professionals in related fields such as geotechnical, hydrological, or environmental science. Of those three members, one is a civil engineer and one a geologist or hydrologist. Two members are professionals in other disciplines with at least ten years of professional experience. One member of these must reside in Orleans Parish on the west side of the Mississippi River. There are two members-at-large, one of whom must reside on the west side of the Mississippi River. Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority Nominating Committee  The SLFPA Nominating Committee consists of eleven members. Four are deans of various universities and the remainder is members of various engineering and good government organizations. This committee nominates individuals to the SLFPA East and West when there are vacancies. Members of the Nominating Committee have no defined term limits. In the spring of 2017, state representative Patrick Connick agreed to file a bill requiring term limits for the nominating committee at the urging of Sandy Rosenthal founder of Levees.org. The rationale was that this relatively small group of people decides who will spend upward of $60 million of taxpayer money annually and provided an opportunity for corruption. The state legislature agreed and passed HB266 by a vote of 37-0 in the Senate and 93-0 in the House requiring term limits. Rosenthal and the bills's sponsor were invited by Governor John Bel Edwards to the Capitol Press Room for a special signing on June 16, 2017. Inspections, Analysis and Public Reporting The current chair of the SLFPA nominating committee stated in an email communication on Nov 17, 2015 that \\"...the Louisiana legislature created SLFPAE to focus on flood protection across parish boundaries, including the oversight of the Corps of Engineers that OLD claimed to provide. Note that \\"oversight\\" includes independent inspection, analysis, and public reporting....\\" Despite this focus, the corps gave all parts of the system a ranking of \\"minimally acceptable\\" and repeatedly warned the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority-East and -West and the state's Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority that maintenance issues pose a continuing threat to individual pieces of the levee system. And despite the focus on public reporting, there is no record that the SLFPA alerted the public of the low ranking.

The bridge was designed by and built under the supervision of David Lennox, the first Colonial Superintendent of Bridges using convict labour between 1836 and 1839. The Lennox Bridge is the third oldest surviving masonry bridge in New South Wales. The bridge carries Church Street, the main north- south street of Parramatta's central business district. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. History A view of the Lennox Bridge from the northeastern bank of Parramatta River. The Lennox Bridge is on the site of the earliest documented crossing of the Parramatta River in the Parramatta area, dating from early colonial settlement. The current bridge is the third on, or adjacent to the site. The first was a simple timber footbridge which was destroyed by floods in 1795. The second bridge, called the Gaol Bridge; built on stone piers with timber railings and was completed between 1802 and 1804. The current Lennox Bridge is a single span stone elliptical arch bridge over Parramatta River on the line of Church Street. The Lennox Bridge is constructed of sandstone sourced from the Parramatta Female Factory quarry. Completed in 1839, the bridge cost ¬£1,797 to complete. This was David Lennox's third and final bridge, his first two being the Lennox Bridge at , completed in 1833 making it the second-oldest bridge on the Australian mainland, (the oldest being the bridge at the base of Devines Hill at Wisemans Ferry on the Great North Road, which was completed in 1829-30) and the Lansdowne Bridge, , completed in 1836. In 1885-86 the Department of Public Works removed the wall on the upstream side of the bridge was to widen it, and put up the present railing at the same time. In 1901-1902 the bridge was strengthened internally for the Castle Hill Tramway. In 1912 the parapet on the western side was removed, providing a cantilevered pedestrian way. In 1934-5 this new section was removed; the Department of Main Roads widening the bridge in order to handle increased traffic. This modification saw the replacement of the cantilevered walk-way with an open concrete type and the straightening of the curved western face. In the 1990s Lennox Bridge was saved from demolition by campaigning by the National Trust of Australia (NSW).  Description  Lennox Bridge is a single sandstone arch bridge spanning 91 feet (27.73m), the clear span of the arch being 23.16 m across the Parramatta River with approaches on the line of Church St. Construction of tunnels for pedestrians and cyclists In 2012 a controversial proposal to construct tunnels through the bridge on both sides of the bank for pedestrians and cyclists was approved by Parramatta City Council; and work began in early 2014 with expectations to open before Christmas that year. However, there was a delay attributed to archeological investigations that uncovered a sandstone pier and timber girders of the second bridge on that site, built between 1802 and 1804. The northern tunnel has opened, but the southern tunnel has not.  Heritage listing  Lennox Bridge is one of Parramatta's most important historic structures, and one of the earliest bridges in New South Wales and Australia. It is an example of the work of notable engineer David Lennox. The site possesses potential to contribute to an understanding of early urban development in Parramatta. The bridge is both historically and technically significant, and is rare. Lennox Bridge, Parramatta was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

It is a defensible hill town famous for V√©zelay Abbey. The town and its 11th-century Romanesque Basilica of St Magdalene are designated UNESCO World Heritage sites. History =Ancient history= The first traces of human settlement in the vicinity of V√©zelay date from 2300‚Äì2200 BC. near the sources of the Salt Fountains. In the first century and the second century, about two thousand mine shafts were mined in the south-west of Vezelay by about five hundred to eight hundred slaves. These mines allowed the creation of a center of economic activity (market), a refuge and probably a place of pilgrimage.Ren√© Louis, Les fouilles gallo-romaines de Saint-P√®re-sous-V√©zelay (Yonne) : vue d'ensemble sur les campagnes 1934, 1935 et 1936 aux lieux-dits ¬´ Les Fontaines-Sal√©es ¬ª, ¬´ Le Perron ¬ª et ¬´ La Corv√©e Saint-Jean ¬ª, Soci√©t√© des fouilles arch√©ologiques et des monuments historiques de l'Yonne, 1937. From the 1st century, the Romans set up the wine-growing on the hill of V√©zelay. A temple in honor of Bacchus was discovered by the parish priest Guenot in 1689 in the foundations of the old church of Saint-Etienne during the construction of a new bell tower, which shows the importance of this culture in the region.Bernard Pujo, Histoire de V√©zelay, Perrin, 2000 (). =Middle Ages= V√©zelay Abbey In the 9th century the Benedictines were given land to build a monastery during the reign of Charles the Bald.Jaucourt, Louis, chevalier de. \\"V√©zelay.\\" The Encyclopedia of Diderot & d'Alembert Collaborative Translation Project.

Originally published as \\"V√©zelay,\\" Encyclop√©die ou Dictionnaire raisonn√© des sciences, des arts et des m√©tiers, 17:226‚Äì227 (Paris, 1765). According to legend, not long before the end of the first millennium a monk named Baudillon brought relics of Mary Magdalene to V√©zelay from Saint-Maximin-la-Sainte- Baume. In 1058 Pope Stephen IX confirmed the authenticity of the relics, leading to an influx of pilgrims that has continued to this day. V√©zelay Abbey was also a major starting point for pilgrims on the Way of St. James to Santiago de Compostela. This was crucially important in attracting pilgrims and the wealth they brought to the town. Bernard of Clairvaux preached the Second Crusade at the Council of V√©zelay in 1146 with King Louis VII of France. The crowd was so large that a large platform was erected on a hill outside the city. The full text has not survived, but a contemporary account says that \\"his voice rang out across the meadow like a celestial organ\\" When Bernard was finished the crowd enlisted en masse and they supposedly ran out of cloth to make crosses. Bernard is said to have flung off his own robe and began tearing it into strips to make more crosses.Durant (1950) p.594. Others followed his example and he and his helpers were supposedly still producing crosses as night fell. On 2nd July 1190, the Frankish and English factions of the Third Crusade met at V√©zelay before officially departing for the Holy Land. The human settlement on the hill of V√©zelay is very anterior to the Benedictine abbey. Merovingian sarcophagi were found in the basement of the church of St. Peter, and under one of them an older sarcophagus. In 2012, a Carolingian wall was discovered, under the cloister of V√©zelay. Girart de Roussillon received by a favor from Louis the Pious and chose in 858 to ensure the perenniality of his possessions by transforming them into two Benedictine communities, respectively male and female: Pothi√®res and V√©zelay. He founded a monastery of women at the present site of Saint-P√®re. It has a villa, surrounded by large estates. The neighborhood in which the houses are located bears the name of Vezeliacus which will become Vizeliac then V√©zelay. This was a tenuous start, abruptly interrupted between 871 and 877, when the Normans dislodged the nuns. Girart then asks for their replacement by a community of men. The abbey was then transferred to the hill and Benedictine monks replaced the nuns. The position of the monastery attracted many families to take advantage of the protection of the walls of the new establishment. It was dedicated to the Virgin and the apostles St. Peter and St. Paul. Its status is quite peculiar, for it was affiliated with Cluny, which was exempted until 1744: Some authors assert that in 882 the monk Badilon had brought from Saint- Maximin-la-Sainte-Baume to V√©zelay, relics of Mary Magdalene. On the other hand, Eudes, first abbot, is mentioned in 897. =The abbey of V√©zelay= Elected in 1037, Abbot Geoffroy reformed the abbey and convinced his contemporaries that the abbey possessed the remains of Mary Magdalene: hence pilgrimages, and offerings and donations. Between the years 1050 and 1250, V√©zelay was the largest Magdalenian sanctuary in Western Europe. This benefited the inhabitants naturally and the village became a small town. \\"Hence, among them, a spirit of independence, which monastic despotism irritated, and which soon manifested itself by bloody revolts, obstinate struggles.\\" It will be necessary to wait for a pontifical bull to make Madeleine officially become the patroness of the abbey (1050). Such prosperity attracted Cluny, who submitted to Vezelay and appointed the Abbe Artaud. In 1060, V√©zelay obtained the right of commune. In 1096, Urban II preached the first crusade; The construction of the abbey church was decided. It was consecrated in 1104. The abbe Artaud was assassinated in 1106. After many vicissitudes (revolts, seigneurial conflicts, the fire of 1120 caused by lightning), the narthex or Church of the Penitent Pilgrims was built: it was dedicated only in 1132. In 1137 the Abbe Alb√©ric signed a charter with the inhabitants that defines the rights of the abbey and the bourgeois: an act of wisdom that was praised In laudatory terms by Bernard of Clairvaux. In the twelfth century, V√©zelay developed. Then, in 1146, V√©zelay's reputation was such that Bernard de Clairvaux preached the second crusade at the place known as the Saint Bernard cross. The place of preaching was transformed into a commemorative church: there were still some ruinis known as \\"La Cordelle\\". Abb√© Ponce de Montbossier temporarily restored the abbey to its former privileges of independence (\\"pote, potestas Vezeliacensis\\"). The abbots receive enormous prerogatives from the Vatican: the right to wear the miter, the crosier, the ring and the sandals. At the same time, the city continued its development and was fortified in 1150 with 2,000 meters of curtain-wall and the construction of the Holy Cross gate. Then, the city obtained communal institutions in 1152, which are withdrawn in 1155 by Louis VII. After the revolt of 1167, the inhabitants obtained from the monks a written charter which guaranteed them enviable liberties in the region (\\"libertas Vezeliacensis\\"). In 1190, Philippe Auguste and Richard C≈ìur de Lion met for the third crusade. The choir of the Romanesque church was rebuilt into a larger one. Abbe Hugues, a corrupt man, squandered the wealth of the abbey and was dismissed in 1207. The decline of the abbey began, coinciding with the decline of the monastic orders and that of the Benedictines in particular. =Decline of the Abbey= Towards 1215, the abbey was completed, and the conflicts with the counts of Nevers resumed. The different popes and kings of France could do nothing to protect the religious community. The protection of the relics of the Madeleine seemed to be ineffective, and the pilgrims turned away from this troubled city by so many conflicts (such as the uprising of 1250). Pope Clement IV launched an inquiry to understand the reasons for such a forfeiture and ordered a solemn verification of the relics of the Madeleine. King St. Louis joined the ceremony (on April 24, 1267). But in 1279, the pope proclaimed that the body found at Saint-Maximin-la-Sainte-Baume was indeed the body of Mary Magdalene. The pilgrims turned away from V√©zelay and prosperity left too. In 1280, an ordinance signed by Philip the Bold proclaims the more or less complete attachment of Vezelay to the royal domain. Pope Martin IV approved the decree. With the Order of 1312, Philip the Fair confirmed that city and abbey are an ordinary dependency of the royal domain. The inhabitants understood that this authority allowed them to contain the abbatial independence, and to escape the brutalities of feudal lords. Vezelay enters the restricted circle of the towns of the kingdom (there were only 16). In 1360, the wall was rebuilt and reinforced with round towers with machicolations. On July 27, 1421, the troops of the Duke of Burgundy, Philippe Le Bon, await the army of rescue at V√©zelay. They make their junction with the English contingents of King Henry V, commanded by his brother, the Duke of Bedford, John of Lancaster. The two armies gather 12,000 men and meet to counter the forces of the Dauphin Charles at La Charit√©-sur-Loire. Abbot Hugues de Maison-Comte, an adviser to Charles V, is known for his fairness in his relations with the inhabitants of V√©zelay (1353‚Äì1383), and Abb√© Alexandre, adviser to Philippe Le Bon for his diplomatic role. He exhorted the Vezelians to leave the Anglo-Burgundian league and contributed to the rapprochement between Philip the Good and Charles VII and led to the meeting of the Council of Basel in 1431. Finally, he participated in the elaboration of the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges in 1438. Louis XI did not tolerate the abbots being bound to the Duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold. In order to secure a stronghold, he brutally imposed one of his courtiers, Pierre de Balzac. The New Gate of V√©zelay built at the end of the 15th century and where the sites are still visible. At the end of the 15th century, a new door was built in the precincts: the Porte Neuve. The latter is defended by two round towers about twelve meters in diameter with walls three meters thick, and two harrows are added to the door in order to be able to prohibit access.Nicolas Martin, La France fortifi√©e : Ch√¢teaux, villes et places fortes, Paris, Nathan, 1990 () In 1538, a bull granted what the monks long demanded: namely secularization. The abbey becomes a simple collegiate church, a chapter of canons replaces the Benedictine monks and especially the domain is placed in the hands of commendatory abbots. Francis I tried in vain to get Vezelay to become a bishopric. The bull of 1541 was registered by the Parlement of Paris only in 1653. It bore only insufficient income and favored the commendatory abbots. =Wars of religion= During the wars of religion, the abbots made a strong place of the Protestant League. Under the influence of Theodore de Beze, the abbey made V√©zelay one of the first towns of the region allied to Protestantism. In March 1569, the town was taken by the Protestant troops of Captains Sarrasin and Blosset, anxious to win a good military position. The city was soon besieged by the armies of Charles IX commanded by Louis Prevost of Sansac. The cavalry was launched on V√©zelay on October 6, but the captains entrenched in the city defended themselves very well by attacking in their turn. The bombings since Asquins and Saint-P√®re yielded nothing. The siege turned into a blockade to starve the city. The city did not surrender despite eight months of siege and intense fighting, thanks to a supply of relief from Protestant troops. Sansac lifted the camp, leaving the city untaken, on February 25, 1570.Histoire du protestantisme et de la Ligue en Bourgogne. T. 1 / par P.-M. Baudouin ‚Äì 1881‚Äì1884, p. 51 At the treaty of Saint-Germain (1570), V√©zelay was one of the two towns of the government of Champagne to authorize the Protestants to freely exercise their worship. In 1594 Edme de Rochefort, Sieur de Pluvault, who governed the city in the name of the League, gave the place to Henri IV and took the lead of the royalist troops to take Avallon. Wine Bourgogne V√©zelay is the local wine appellation. Vineyards descend to the edge of the town and produce a range of mostly white wines, based mainly on the Chardonnay, Pinot noir and Melon de Bourgogne grape varieties. About half of the production is marketed through the Cave Henry co-operative. The vineyards are believed to have been established by the Monastery in the ninth century. In the late nineteenth century the vineyards were decimated by phylloxera. The vineyards were revived during the 1970s.

These revolving offices, or cargos, become the unpaid responsibility of men who are active in civic life. They typically hold a given post for a term of one year, and alternate between civic and religious obligations from year to year. Office holders execute most of the tasks of local governments and churches. Individuals who hold a cargo are generally obligated to incur the costs of feasting during the fiestas that honor particular saints. Where it is practiced, there is generally some expectation of all local men to take part in this cargo system throughout their lives. Office holders assume greater responsibilities as they grow in stature in the community. Such progression requires substantial financial resources, but eventually an individual who holds a requisite number of posts in service to his community retires and joins a group of elders instrumental in community decision-making, including appointing people to cargos. This expectation of local men to take part in this system is both an economic and a social one, as those who do not contribute are seen as not being deserving of living in the village. It served to create a village system where the old were helped by the young and women helped by men. Furthermore, the legal enforcement of village obligations solidified communal (social) identity, rather than an identity dependent upon and linked to the national state. The cargo system has also been considered influenced by traditional Hispanic customs, as the municipal government provided the tradition of cargas consejiles', where village residents are obligated to serve post terms. During the 19th and 20th centuries, the cargo system was a ladder system in which indigenous men could climb up. The cargo system was mainly defined as a public labor and community service. Villages that were impoverished were able to get help easier because taxes were not charged, yet public work was given. It was a system in which involved faithful and long term community service. Men and women (husband and wife) were considered one unit, men needed their wives in order to succeed in their community. Women did not claim rights in relation to village government.Caulfield, Sueann, et al. ‚ÄúCommunity Service, Liberal Law and Local Custom in Indigenous Villages: Oaxaca, 1750-1850.‚Äù Honor, Status, and Law in Modern Latin America, Duke University Press, 2005, pp. 60‚Äì63. History The origins of the cargo system are tied to the efforts of Spanish missionaries to convert indigenous peoples of the Americas to Christianity while at the same time forestalling their cultural Hispanicization. After the Spanish conquest of Mesoamerica in the 16th century, many Indians were forcibly relocated to pueblos, which like Spanish villages contained a church as the town center. Priests were one of many special interest foreigners who had control over the political and social affairs of indigenous peoples, and they had dominion over many of these pueblos and had the authority to keep other colonists out. The priests were mindful that much of their influence over the Indians stemmed from the priests' ability to speak Indian languages. Despite a 1550 royal edict calling for native peoples to be taught the Spanish language, missionaries continued to minister to them in Nahuatl and other local languages, thus preserving a major source of Indian dependency on the church. The colonial church did not insist on excessive Catholicization of existing indigenous practices, so long as there was no clear conflict between the two. Because the missionaries were small in number, they increasingly placed religious responsibilities in the hands of trusted members of the villages. The village mayor or alcalde was charged with the responsibility of leading the villagers in a procession to Sunday Mass. Over time, these processions were conducted with greater ceremony, making use of trappings such as crosses, incense, and music. The cargo system was used and transformed by communities within the context of law to eliminate noble exemption privileges. This brought to an end many internal feuds over principales with regards to nobility. Noble exemptions were opposed by the common people, who were worried that such exemptions would negatively impact the supply of labour to the point of constant service. It was impossible to become part of the nobility by marrying the daughter of a noble, and was instead pushed by claimants based on heritage. Therefore, in practice, the system was not as egalitarian as in the hypothetical sense, because while some men could move to greater positions and into seats of authority, others lacked the prestige to accomplish the same. The dispersal of the ability to accumulate wealth along with prestige also contributed greatly to the transformation of these villages. On occasion drawing on a Spanish institution called the cofrad√≠as, the priests created a hierarchy of village posts in order to better organize the religious and civil lives of their Indians. Indigenous people filled these roles, which in theory gave them greater status within the community. These roles, however, also placed economic obligations on their recipients and the clergy used them as a way to exercise control over the villagers. Villagers were obligated to organize efforts to discharge debts related to cost of food, wafers and wine for the Mass and payment of the priests. The cargo system could a serve a manner in which people could elevate their station in society. People who faithfully discharged their duties through a series of mundane tasks could increase their social status which resulted in greater access for job opportunities and loftier positions. In short, community service allowed one to move up in the hierarchy of their society. Eventually villagers could reach a high ranking position as members of the principals, who in turn would vote for the communal leader, the gobernadores. The caciques ore pre-Hispanic nobles were exempt from the low standing positions, although a person from meager beginnings could ultimately serve to accumulate wealth and power. The cargo system also affected marital life. The man would work in the household of his in-laws. After marriage, the wife would move in with the groom's family in which she served as a domestic servant for her mother-in law.

Life Leenhardt was born in Montauban. At the beginning of the twentieth century, Protestant authorities concerned themselves with the evangelisation of the Kanaks, in competition with the Marist Brothers. Maurice Leenhardt was named pastor in 1902 in New Caledonia where he founded the \\"D√∂ n√®v√¢\\" mission in the valley of Houailou. Going beyond his role of pastor, he applied himself to understanding the mentality of these people. When he arrived in New Caledonia, Maurice Leenhardt was welcomed by these words from the mayor of Noum√©a: What have you come to do here? In ten years there will be no more Kanaks. He applied himself to the fight against this slow genocide; he combatted the alcoholism that slowly ravaged the Kanak people. He translated the New Testament into the Houa√Ølou language with the help of his first students. He returned to France in 1927 where he founded the Soci√©t√© des Oc√©anistes and the Mus√©e de l'Homme, and took the chair of Lucien L√©vy-Bruhl at the √âcole des Hautes √âtudes en Sciences Sociales. Following a second stay of nearly ten years in New Caledonia, he began teaching Oceanic languages at the Institut National des Langues et Civilisations Orientales in 1944. He died in Paris. Leenhardt's daughter Stella married the historian of religions and theologian Henry Corbin (1933). Contributions to Ethnology Maurice Leenhardt's contributions to ethnology are considerable, though he did not frame them theoretically. Before Bronislaw Malinowski, he practiced the ethnology advocated by Marcel Mauss from his office in Paris. For twenty-five years he practiced participant observation and active research, the virtues of which were not rediscovered until the 1960s. Maurice Leenhardt was not a dogmatist and through all these contributions, he never sought followers. He was nevertheless one of the first to consider social phenomena in their totality and to study the art, myths, and customs of the Kanak people as well as their language.

It is within the Diocese of Portsmouth. The ancient church, a Grade I listed building, is located in the centre of the town, on the south side of the Square. The architect Nikolaus Pevsner described it as \\"one of the most interesting churches in Hampshire\\",\\"The Buildings of England: Hampshire and the Isle of Wight‚Äù Pevsner,N/LLoyd,D p371 London, Penguin, 1990 History A chapel of ease was originally built, and called 'St. Peter's in-the-veld' (veld - meaning an open and clear place), within the manor of West Mapledurham (later Buriton). Although the town around the chapelry soon grew larger than that around the main church, St Peter's remained a chapelry to Buriton until 1886, when it became a separate parish. Since 1984 the two parishes have been held in plurality, so the Vicar of Petersfield is now also Rector of Buriton. St Peter's was originally a Norman building; the north and south aisles were added at the end of the 12th century. The tower was raised to its present height during the 14th century and a parapet added. During the 15th century, several windows with perpendicular tracery were insertedA History of Christianity in Petersfield, Leaton, E. (ed.) (2001, Petersfield, Petersfield Area Historical Society: Monograph Number 4) ISSN 0262-5970 In 1873, a major restoration took place under the architect Sir Arthur Blomfield. St Peter's was closed from October 1998 while the 'St Peter's 2000 Project' carried out an extensive restoration and re-ordering of the building. The church was re- dedicated by the Bishop of Portsmouth on 1 October 1999. The building St Peter's began as a cruciform shape to which a tower was added soon after construction. The chancel arch has two orders, one ancient and one from the 1873 restoration. It has two transepts, the south of which was used as a chapel, there being a 13th-century piscina in the wall. Each transept has different pillar capitals. The local squires, the Jolliffes, had a gallery for their own use situated in the south-west corner of the church. There was a major fire in 1962 after which the timber above the south side aisle had to be replaced. =Measurements= The chancel is 9.75 metres by 4.27 metres, with modern vestry and organ chamber on the north, nave 18.59 metres by 5.03 metres, with north and south aisles, 4.87 metres and 5.18 metres wide respectively, north porch, and engaged west tower 5.02 metres by 5.18 metres. =Chancel= The chancel has at the east a modern triplet of windows in twelfth-century style, replacing a five-light fifteenth-century window. In the north wall is a late twelfth-century round-headed light, now blocked by the vestry roof, with inner jamb-shafts continued as a roll round the head of the window, unbroken except for a fillet on the springing-line of the arch. On the north the recess is pierced with a modern arch opening to the organ chamber. =Nave= The nave arcades are of four bays, the east arches on both sides being wider than the west. All are round-headed but only the two western arches of the south arcade are old. The columns are circular, as are the capitals of the north arcade, but those of the south are square, with recessed angles, being of somewhat earlier type than the others. They have small scallops and a deep vertical face above them, while in the north arcade the capitals have convex flutes. As already noted, the pillars of the north arcade have been altered and reset, but the two western pillars and the western respond of the south arcade are in their original positions, the capitals being at a higher level than those of the third pillar and eastern respond. The clerestory of the nave is an early 20th-century addition, with pairs of round-headed windows. =Tower= The west tower is of four stages, the top stage being of fifteenth-century date, embattled, with belfry windows of two cinquefoiled lights, and the lower three stages are of the twelfth century. At the southwest angle is a stair entered from without the church. The side walls on the ground stage are solid, but in the east wall is a wide semicircular arch of two square orders, dating from the first half of the 12th Century, with hollow-chamfered abaci like those of the chancel arch; and over it a plain roundheaded opening from the second stage of the tower, which must have given access to the roof of the early nave, as just above it is a gabled weathering. This latter is not quite central with the opening, its apex being to the south. =Internal features= Font The font dates from the 15th century. It was replaced in 1873 and lay at the side of the churchyard for 70 years before being restored. Organ The organ was replaced in 1992 by Lammermuir Pipe Organs. There is a stained glass window to Bishop Samuel Wilberforce and another to Mary Sumner, founder of the Mothers' Union. Altar The altar was created by the noted craftsman Edward Barnsley. Memorial A brass tablet on the south wall honours Petersfield's only VC, Loftus Jones. in the west bay of the north aisle are two brass plates, one with an inscription to Anne Holt, 1655, the other to Dr. Thomas Aylwin, 1704, and his wife Mary, 1693. Many of the memorials have been removed from the nave and repositioned in the far south of the church, many in newly created utility rooms.\\"A guide to St Peter's Church, Petersfield\\" Petersfield; St Peter's Petersfield Parish Office; 2011 Plate The plate comprises a silver communion cup and cover paten of 1568; a second cup and cover paten of 1612, given by Thomas Antrobus, senior, of Heath House; a flagon of 1707; a standing paten of 1721, given in 1830 by Thomas Chitty; an alms dish of 1757, given 1758, and a second dish of 1812, given 1813.Pevsner (ibid)  Bells  There are eight bells, the treble and second by Warner, 1889; the third and seventh by Taylor, 1895; the fourth and fifth by Robert Catlin, 1750; the sixth by Thomas Lester, 1746, and the tenor by Pack and Chapman, 1771.Dove‚Äôs Guide Registers The first book of the registers runs from 1558 to 1667, and contains entries of deaths from plague in 1563 and 1666; the second from 1669 to 1757, the marriages ending at 1754; the third has baptisms and burials, 1758‚Äì1807; the fourth marriages, 1754‚Äì84‚Äîthis is a MS. book, and not the printed book ordered by the Act of 1753; the fifth and sixth continue the marriage entries to 1804 and 1812; the seventh contains baptisms 1808‚Äì13, and the eighth burials for the same period.

Businessman After his father's death, in 1888, Emanuel Nobel took over the running of the Nobel family's oil business, Branobel, an oil empire that was based in Baku and was the largest oil company in Europe, of which he and his brothers and sisters were by far the main shareholders, followed by his uncles Alfred and Robert. Carl Nobel, Emanuel's brother, was put in charge of the Machine-Building Factory Ludvig Nobel.Tolf, Robert (1976): The Russian Rockefellers : the saga of the Nobel family and the Russian oil industry Hoover Institution Press, Stanford University, p. 109. Emanuel Nobel was a very forward-looking businessman, just like his father, who had instigated the construction of Russia's first pipeline and the world's first oil tanker in 1878, as well as the world's first railway tank cars in 1883. On 16 February 1898 Emanuel signed a licence agreement in Berlin with Rudolf Diesel, after having heard Diesel describing his new engine in a public lecture. The agreement allowed Nobel to build the world's first diesel engine plant in St Petersburg, and the engines were used to propel Branobel's fleet of oil tankers. Emanuel led Baku to a dominating role in the global oil industry and Branobel activities soon developed throughout the Caspian Sea, operating also in Grozny and Dosser. In 1888, Emanuel was host to Tsar Alexander III and Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark) in Baku and was then personally requested by the Tsar to accept Russian citizenship, which he graciously accepted. From 1891 until 1918, His Excellency Emanuel Nobel was also on the board of the Russian State Bank's Discount Committee.√Ösbrink, Brita (2001): Ludvig Nobel: \\"Petroleum har en lysande framtid!\\" Wahlstr√∂m & Widstrand, p. 134-135 He was in charge of the company until he was forced to flee Russia in the Summer of 1918.Yergin, Daniel (2003): The Prize: the Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power, Free Press, p. 237. In 1904 in Baku was established the Russian Prize named after Emanuel Ludvigovich Nobel by Baku Branch of Imperial Russian Technical Society (devoted to 25th years anniversary of \\"BraNobel Co.\\" in 1879). Prize was given four times (in 1909, 1910, 1911 and 1914 years). In 1919, Emanuel Nobel invested in the engineering office of Boris Hagelin. In 1922, he invested in Swedish cryptography company Cryptograph, installing Hagelin as a manager. Emanuel's role in the execution of Alfred Nobel's will After Alfred Nobel died, in 1896, and his will was disclosed, the heirs of his eldest brother, Robert, displeased by the fact that the major part of their uncle's estate was bequeathed to the creation of the Nobel Foundation and of the Nobel Prizes, started a legal action to invalidate it. Emanuel Nobel, however, as head of the younger branch of the family, played a fundamental role in supporting the execution of his uncle's wishes, pleading even before King Oscar II, and an agreement with Robert Nobel's heirs was reached in 1898, thus allowing the creation of the Nobel Prizes.Sch√ºck, Henrik, Ragnar Sohlman, Anders √ñsterling, Carl Gustaf Bernhard, the Nobel Foundation, and Wilhelm Odelberg, eds.

The rooms of the Nobel family's residence in St. Petersburg and of its Summer residence, Kirjola, on the Karelian Isthmus, displayed one of the most important collections, after the Romanov Imperial Collection, of Faberg√©'s masterworks and of Russian painting. A considerable part of the collection kept in St. Petersburg was saved from the hands of the Bolsheviks as well as most of the art objects that furnished Kirjola, which was destroyed during the Winter War in 1940. Final years The outcome of the Russian Revolution forced Emanuel to flee Russia in the Summer of 1918. After the seizure of the Nobel family's properties by the Bolsheviks, Emanuel gradually retreated from the direction of the family's businesses. He never married and died in 1932 in Sweden.

History and meaning Russian Orthodox Icon of the Harrowing of Hell and raising up of Adam (16th century). The Slavs, like many ancient peoples, had a tradition of visiting family members' graves during the springtime and feasting together with them. After their conversion to Christianity, this custom transferred into the Russian Orthodox Church as the festival of Radonitsa, the name of which comes from the Slavic word \\"radost'\\", meaning \\"joy.\\" In Kievan Rus' the local name is \\"Krasnaya Gorka\\" (–ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–∞—è –≥–æ—Ä–∫–∞, \\"Beautiful Hill\\"), and has the same meaning. It may seem strange to call a memorial for the departed \\"joyful,\\" but the Christian belief that lies behind this joy is the remembrance of Jesus' Resurrection and the joy and hope it brings to all. Because of the importance of the last few days of Holy Week, and because of the joy of the Resurrection, the Typikon (Ustav) forbids, as in other festal periods, special prayers for the departed, e.g. a Panikhida, (except for funerals, which, obviously, cannot be postponed) from Great and Holy Thursday through Thomas Sunday (a period of eleven days). Therefore, the first opportunity after Pascha to remember the dead is on the second Monday of Pascha. However, because in Orthodox countries, a number of monasteries follow the custom of fasting on Mondays, the feast is often celebrated on Tuesday, so that all may partake of eggs. Ancient tradition The practice of greeting the dead with the Resurrection is not merely a \\"baptism\\" of pagan practices, but has antecedents in the ancient Church. S. V. Bulgakov records the following: > The commemoration of the departed after Pascha was also done in extreme > antiquity. St. Ambrose of Milan (340 ‚Äì 397) says in one of his sermons: \\"It > is truly meet and right, brethren, that after the celebration of Pascha, > which we have celebrated, to share our joy with the holy martyrs and by them > as participants in the suffering of the Lord, to announce the glory of the > resurrection of the Lord\\". Although these words of St. Ambrose relate to > martyrs, they may be an indication of our custom to commemorate the departed > after Pascha on Monday or Tuesday of Thomas Week because the beginning of > the solemn commemorations in the faith of those who died is established in > the New Testament Church as a pious custom to the memory of the martyrs, > [both] among the martyrs buried in antiquity and the others who have died.S. > V. Bulgakov, Handbook for Church Servers, 2nd ed., 1274 pp. (Kharkov, 1900), > pp. 586-589. Tr. by Archpriest Eugene D. Tarris ¬© 2007. St. John Chrysostom (349 - 407) also bears testimony that in his day they celebrated a joyful commemoration of the departed on Tuesday of Saint Thomas Week in his Homily on the Cemetery and the Cross. Practices Candles and easter eggs left on a grave at Danilov monastery, Moscow. Ukrainian names of Radonitsa) in Ukraine Although the Typikon does not prescribe any special prayers for the departed on these days, the memorial is kept as a pious custom. Unlike the various Soul Saturdays throughout the year, there are no changes made to Vespers, Matins or the Divine Liturgy, to reflect this being a day of the dead. On this day, after Divine Liturgy, the priest will celebrate a Panikhida in the church, after which he will bless the paschal foods that the faithful have brought with them. The clergy, with incense and candles, will then go in procession with the cross, followed by the faithful, to visit the graves of departed believers either in churchyards or in cemeteries. At the graves, paschal hymns are chanted together with the usual litanies for the departed, concluding with the moving \\"Memory Eternal\\" (–í—£—á–Ω–∞—ß –ø–∞–º—ß—Ç—å,Viechnaia pamiat). The paschal foods will then be consumed with joy by the friends and relatives of the deceased. It is common to place an Easter egg, a symbol of Christ's coming forth from the Tomb, on the graves of the departed, saluting them with the traditional paschal greeting: \\"Christ is Risen!\\" This practice is both to remind the faithful of the General Resurrection of the dead, and to \\"announce the Resurrection\\" of Christ to the departed. Customs Among the traditions that have grown up around Radonitsa, the following are noteworthy: * Foods traditionally eaten at Radonitsa are: funeral kutia, painted eggs, kulichi, pancakes, dracheni, honey prianiki, and cookies. * Radonitsa begins the marriage season. Since weddings are forbidden during the Great Lenten Fast (because that time should be devoted to penance and self-examination, rather than merrymaking), as well as during Bright Week (because at that time we commemorate nothing else except the Resurrection), with Radonitsa comes the time for weddings. * Men and women traditionally give gifts to their in-laws (more kindly known as \\"God-given\\" family members), at Radonitsa, so that joy may be in every house.

They remain lush and fresh-looking throughout the season. The stalks and most midribs are coated with attractive cinnamon-brown scales. The Latin specific epithet setiferum means ‚Äúwith bristles‚Äù.  Distribution  It is most abundant in Ireland, southwestern Great Britain, western France and northwest Iberia, where it benefits from the combination of mild winters and moist summers, but also occurs more locally north to northern Scotland and east to the Crimea and Turkey; in the Mediterranean it usually grows at high altitudes. It grows in woodlands, often but not always on steep slopes.  Description  Close-up of new leaf The fern's bright green fronds are long, usually drooping downslope, with typically four to ten fronds on a mature plant. The fronds are soft-textured, bipinnate (single-pinnate on small, young plants), with the pinnae opposite on the stalk. Each pinna is long, with a large upward-pointing pinnule at the base, and the other pinnules decreasing in size toward the pinna tip; the pinnules have softly bristly tips. Individual fronds live for nine to fifteen months and remain attached to the rhizome after withering. The round sori occupy two rows on either side of the midrib of each pinnule and are covered by a centrally-attached, umbrella-like indusium with fringed edges. They produce light yellow spores.  Cultivation  Polystichum setiferum is frequently cultivated as an ornamental plant for use in gardens. There are many cultivars available: over 300 have been described although most are no longer in cultivation or not considered sufficiently distinct for an individual name.Rickard 2000, p. 146 The following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit: *Divisilobum Group **‚ÄôDivisilobum Densum‚Äô ** ‚ÄòDivisilobum Iveryanum‚Äô ** ‚ÄòHerrenhausen‚Äô * Plumosomultilobum Group  References   Further reading  * Flora Europaea: Polystichum setiferum * Hyde, H.

In Roman times it may have been known as \\"Batinus\\". The source of the Tordino is located between Monte Gorzano and Pelone, in the Monti della Laga subchain of the Apennines. After a course of , it flows into the Adriatic Sea. The river initially flows in a torrent to the east through the Gran Sasso National Park, then directs to the north around Mount Bilanciere before flowing in a south-easterly direction. The river curves northward near Torricella Sicura and flows past Teramo. The river flows northeast past San Nicol√≤ a Tordino and Castellalto before flowing into the Adriatic Sea near Giulianova and Cologna Spiaggia. Near its source, the Tordino forms the Fiumata cascades and, a bit further along, the Tordino cascades. It then passes through Padula and Caiano, frazioni of the comune of Cortino. Watermills and olive oil presses are located in the higher elevations. The town of Teramo is located at the junction where the Tordino meets the Vezzola river. The mouth of the rivers is in the town of Giulianova. The Tordino river basin covers an area of approximately . Tributaries on the left bank of the Tordino include the protective irrigation drain known as the Cavata (including three terraces and their associated cascades near the source of the Tordino), the Rivettino, the Castiglione, the Rivoletto, the Rio Verde, the large ditch known as \\"The Inferno,\\" the Fiumicino stream, and the Vezzola river. A large portion of the water of the Vezzola (which begins near the town of Rocca Santa Maria, has a length of , and passes through the Torricella Sicura community) is used by the ENEL () utility company to produce electricity.

At 56 years old for one specimen's age, it is one of the longest-lived catostomids. I. niger is found in the Mississippi Basin and southern Great Lakes. It was first discovered in Canada in the western end of Lake Erie and has been reported from Boston Creek. The Tennessee distribution ranges from rivers and streams in the Cumberland Mountains, a few rivers in middle Tennessee, and in west Tennessee along the Mississippi River.Etnier, D. A., Starnes, W. C. (1993). The Fishes of Tennessee. (1 ed., pp. 278‚Äì280). Knoxville: The University of Tennessee Press. The ecology of the species is quite similar to that of I. bubalus. I. niger has a ventrally positioned mouth, making the species‚Äô diet benthic- oriented. It has a distinct shape that mocks I. bubalus and I. cyprinellus, considering it a hybrid between the two species. Geographic distribution I. niger is found in large and small rivers in eastern North America from the Mississippi Basin to Canada. In Canada, the species was first described in Lake Erie.Houston J. 1990. Status of Black Buffalo, I. niger, in Canada. The Canadian Field-Naturalist 104:98‚Äì102. In the United States, the species is found in both small and large rivers in the basins of the Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio as well as in southern Lake Michigan and Lake Erie. Among others, it is native to Iowa, South Dakota and Minnesota; more southern states include eastern Texas and Oklahoma. Ecology The ecology of I. niger is most closely related to I. cyprinellus. Due to the ventrally positioned mouth, the diet is benthic-oriented, with the Asiatic clam being the principal food. Detritus and sand are also ingested and contribute about 40% of the dietary volume.Ross, Stephen T., W.M. Brenneman, W.T. Slack, M.T. O'Connell, T.L. Peterson. 2001. The Inland Fishes of Mississippi. (1 ed., pp. 278‚Äì279). University Press of Mississippi. It is most commonly found in quiet, shallow waters. The U.S. angling record is and was caught in Tennessee in 1984. The typical length is about with a maximum length of . The typical weight is estimated to be about . A specimen caught in Shelby County, Tennessee, on April 1, 1980, was accepted as valid and weighed . I. niger relies on benthic organisms more heavily than I. bubalus. I. niger feeds mostly from the bottom. Life history Members of Ictiobus are large, robust-bodied suckers adapted to large rivers. Currently recognized species are readily diagnosed by morphological characters, and the group is known from fossils dating back to the Miocene. I. niger is a spring spawner. They spawn in flooded areas and backwaters of sloughs and small to large rivers...NatureServe ‚Äì Ictiobus niger. Fertilized eggs are demersal and adhesive. They hatch in 24‚Äì36 hours at . I. niger grows fairly rapidly, averaging after the first year, and is sexually mature at age 2.Becker, G. C. 1983. The fishes of Wisconsin. University of Wisconsin Press, Madison, Wisconsin. 1052 pp. The spawning period could take days. Spawning fish remain in a state of excitement, and are unconcerned about unusual movements or disturbances. I. niger has been reported violently jumping and repressed eagerness while spawning. The fish do not seem to recover normal reaction to alarm until the spawning draws to an end. The black buffalo has a maximum longevity of at least 56 years as estimated by a thin-sectioned otolith from the Michigian State Record fish taken in 2018. This age is more than 30 years older than previously reported for this species' maximum longevity. Like bigmouth buffalo, the black buffalo is long-lived. Relationship with people No specific plan exists for protection for this species in Canada other than the Fisheries Act. However, I. niger is listed as of special concern in Kentucky, Mississippi, South Dakota, and West Virginia. It has also been listed as protected in Wisconsin. From 1957‚Äì59, only seven specimens were recorded in the Ohio River. In 1968‚Äì69, only four specimens were captured.Trautman M.B. 1981. The Fishes of Ohio. Library of Congress Cataloguing in Publication Data. 409‚Äì411. Threats and issues include loss, modification or fragmentation of large river habitat caused by dams in the Mississippi and Wisconsin Rivers. Mistaken identity leads to the taking of this species in commercial fisheries. The exotic bighead carp shares the habitat with I. niger and consumes large amounts of zooplankton, outcompeting I. niger for needed food.http://dnr.wi.gov/org/land/er/wwap/explore/profiles.asp?mode=detail&species;=AFCJC07030&section;=threats . The IGFA all tackle world record for the species stands at 63lbs 6oz caught from the Mississippi River in Iowa in 1999. Management recommendations To ensure the long life and thriving reproduction of I. niger, protection and restoration of larger river habitat is needed. Education of anglers, biologists, and the general public in taxonomy, systematics, and habitat use is needed. The species presents special difficulties, due to natural hybridization, for both research and enforcement. Dams need to be equipped with fish passages to connect fragmented habitats. Invasive species that compete or degrade the habitat of native fishes need to be controlled.

The two-terminal electret capsule contains a FET which must be externally powered by supply voltage V+. The resistor sets the gain and output impedance. The audio signal appears at the output, after a DC-blocking capacitor. An electret microphone is a type of electrostatic capacitor-based microphone, which eliminates the need for a polarizing power supply by using a permanently charged material. An electret is a stable dielectric material with a permanently embedded static electric dipole moment (which, due to the high resistance and chemical stability of the material, will not decay for hundreds of years). The name comes from electrostatic and magnet; drawing analogy to the formation of a magnet by alignment of magnetic domains in a piece of iron. Electrets are commonly made by first melting a suitable dielectric material such as a plastic or wax that contains polar molecules, and then allowing it to re- solidify in a powerful electrostatic field. The polar molecules of the dielectric align themselves to the direction of the electrostatic field, producing a permanent electrostatic \\"bias\\". Modern electret microphones use PTFE plastic, either in film or solute form, to form the electret. History Electret materials have been known since the 1920s and were proposed as condenser microphone elements several times, but they were considered impractical until the foil electret type was invented at Bell Laboratories in 1961 by James West and Gerhard Sessler, using a thin metallized Teflon foil. This became the most common type, used in many applications from high-quality recording and lavalier use to built-in microphones in small sound recording devices and telephones. Types There are three major types of electret microphones, differing in the way the electret material is used: ; Foil-type or diaphragm-type : A film of electret material is used as the diaphragm itself. This is the most common type, but also the lowest quality, since the electret material does not make a particularly good diaphragm. ; Back electret : An electret film is applied to the back plate of the microphone capsule and the diaphragm is made of an uncharged material, which may be mechanically more suitable for the transducer design being realized. ; Front electret : In this newer type, the back plate is eliminated from the design, and the capacitor is formed by the diaphragm and the inside surface of the capsule. The electret film is adhered to the inside front cover and the metalized diaphragm is connected to the input of the FET. It is equivalent to the back electret in that any conductive film may be used for the diaphragm. Unlike other condenser microphones, electret types require no polarizing voltage, but they normally contain an integrated preamplifier, which does require a small amount of power (often incorrectly called polarizing power or bias). This preamp is frequently phantom powered in sound reinforcement and studio applications. Other types simply include a 1.5 V battery in the microphone housing, which is often left permanently connected as the current drain is usually very small.

He represented the state in the United States House of Representatives and served as its 31st governor. Brown was elected to the House of Representatives for three non-consecutive terms, each of which was marred by controversy. He was first elected in 1859, despite his own protests that he was not yet twenty-five years old; the minimum age set by the Constitution for serving in the legislature. The voters of his district elected him anyway, but he was not allowed to take his seat until the Congress' second session, after he was of legal age to serve. After moving to Henderson, Kentucky, Brown was elected from that district in 1866. On this occasion, he was denied his seat because of alleged disloyalty to the Union during the Civil War. Voters in his district refused to elect another representative, and the seat remained vacant throughout the term to which Brown was elected. After an unsuccessful gubernatorial bid in 1871, Brown was again elected to the House in 1872 and served three consecutive terms. During his final term, he was officially censured for delivering a speech excoriating Massachusetts Representative Benjamin F. Butler. The censure was later expunged from the congressional record. After his service in the House, Brown took a break from politics, but re-entered the political arena as a candidate for governor of Kentucky in 1891. He secured the Democratic nomination in a four-way primary election, then convincingly won the general election over his Republican challenger, Andrew T. Wood. Brown's administration, and the state Democratic Party, were split between gold standard supporters (including Brown) and supporters of the free coinage of silver. Brown's was also the first administration to operate under the Kentucky Constitution of 1891, and most of the legislature's time was spent adapting the state's code of laws to the new constitution. Consequently, little of significance was accomplished during Brown's term. Brown hoped the legislature would elect him to the U.S. Senate following his term as governor. Having already alienated the free silver faction of his party, he backed \\"Goldbug\\" candidate Cassius M. Clay, Jr. for the Democratic nomination in the upcoming gubernatorial election. However, the deaths of two of Brown's children ended his interest in the gubernatorial race and his own senatorial ambitions. At the Democratic nominating convention of 1899, candidate William Goebel used questionable tactics to secure the gubernatorial nomination, and a disgruntled faction of the party held a separate nominating convention, choosing Brown to oppose Goebel in the general election. Goebel was eventually declared the winner of the election, but was assassinated. Brown became the legal counsel for former Kentucky Secretary of State Caleb Powers, an accused conspirator in the assassination. Brown died in Henderson on January 11, 1904. Early life John Young Brown was born on June 27, 1835, in Claysville (near Elizabethtown), Hardin County, Kentucky.Harrison in The Kentucky Encyclopedia, pp. 129‚Äì130 He was the son of Thomas Dudley and Elizabeth (Young) Brown. His father served in the state legislature and was a delegate to the 1849 state constitutional convention.Ireland, p. 123 Two of his uncles, Bryan Rust Young and William Singleton Young, served as U.S. Representatives.\\"Brown, John Young\\". Biographical Directory of the United States Congress Brown spent much time with his father at the state capitol, which sparked his early interest in politics.Levin, p. 212 Brown received his early education in the schools of Elizabethtown, and in 1851, at the age of sixteen, matriculated at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky.Tapp and Klotter, p. 463 In 1855, he graduated from Centre and returned to Hardin County to read law. He was admitted to the bar in 1857 and opened his practice in Elizabethtown. His reputation as an orator put him in high demand, but his zealous criticism of the Know Nothing Party drew threats against his life.Powell, p. 70 Brown married Lucie Barbee in 1857, but she died the following year. In September 1860, he married Rebecca Hart Dixon, the daughter of former U.S. Senator Archibald Dixon. The couple had eight children. U.S. House of Representatives At a meeting of local Democrats in Bardstown, Kentucky, in 1859, Brown was nominated to oppose Joshua Jewett for Jewett's seat in the House of Representatives. Despite Brown's protests that he was more than a year younger than the legal age to serve, he was elected over Jewett by about two thousand votes. He did not take his seat until the second congressional session because of his age. He became a member of the Douglas National Committee in 1860 and engaged in a series of debates with supporters of John C. Breckinridge for president, including Breckinridge's cousin, William Campbell Preston Breckinridge. Benjamin F. Butler; Brown's excoriation of him drew an official censure from the House of Representatives It is not clear exactly when Brown relocated to Henderson, Kentucky. Confederate officer Stovepipe Johnson recounts that Brown was among the city leaders who welcomed him to Henderson in early 1862, but other sources state that Brown did not settle in Henderson until after the war.Johnson, p. 102 His sympathies during the war were decidedly with the Confederacy. Brown was re-elected to the House of Representatives in 1866. His seat was declared vacant, however, because of his alleged disloyalty during the war. Voters in his district refused to elect anyone else to fill the vacancy, and Governor John W. Stevenson filed an official protest of the House's action, but the seat remained unfilled throughout the Fortieth Congress. Governor Stevenson resigned his office to accept a seat in the U.S. Senate, and the remainder of his term was filled by President Pro Tem of the Senate Preston Leslie. When Leslie, who enjoyed only lukewarm support from his party, sought the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1871, Brown's name was among those put in nomination against his; after a few ballots, however, it became clear that Brown would not be able to gain a majority, and his supporters abandoned their support of him in favor of other candidates.Tapp and Klotter, p. 37 The following year, Brown was re-elected to the House of Representatives by an overwhelming vote of 10,888 to 457 and was allowed to assume his seat. He was twice re-elected, serving until 1877. Brown's most notable action in the House was a speech he made on February 4, 1875, in response to Massachusetts Representative Benjamin F. Butler's call to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1875. Referring to comments Butler had made the previous day about lawlessness against African-Americans in the South, Brown claimed that unjust charges had been made against Southerners by an individual \\"who is outlawed in his own home by respectable society, whose name is synonymous with falsehood, who is the champion, and has been on all occasions, of fraud; who is the apologist of thieves, who is such a prodigy of vice and meanness that to describe him would sicken the imagination and exhaust invective.\\"Trefousse, p. 8 Brown continued by referencing notorious Scottish murderer William Burke, whose method of murdering his victims became known as \\"Burking.\\"Trefousse, p. 9 At this point in the speech, Speaker of the House James G. Blaine interrupted Brown, asking if he was referring to a member of the House; Brown gave an ambiguous response before continuing: \\"If I wished to describe all that was pusillanimous in war, inhuman in peace, forbidden in morals, and infamous in politics, I should call it 'Butlerizing'.\\" The House gallery exploded in protest at Brown's remark, and incensed Republican legislators called for Brown's immediate expulsion. Though not expelled, he was officially censured by the House for the use of unparliamentary language. The censure was expunged from the record by a subsequent Congress. 1891 gubernatorial election Cassius M. Clay, Jr., Brown's closest competitor for the 1891 Democratic gubernatorial nomination Following his service in the House, Brown resumed his law practice in Louisville, Kentucky. In 1891, he was a candidate for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination.Harrison in A New History of Kentucky, p. 266 The other candidates included Cassius Marcellus Clay, Jr., son of former Congressman Brutus J. Clay and nephew of abolitionist Cassius Marcellus Clay; Dr. John Daniel Clardy, later to be elected a U.S. Representative; and Attorney General Parker Watkins Hardin. The party was split between supporters of corporations, such as the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, and supporters of agrarian interests. Another split was between the more conservative Bourbon Democrats, who supported maintaining the gold standard, and more progressive Democrats, who called for the free coinage of silver.Tapp and Klotter, p. 317 Agrarian voters were about equally split between Clay and Clardy, while Free Silver Democrats were about equally split between Hardin and Clardy. Having lived in the agrarian western part of the state for most of his life, and never having alienated the powerful Farmers' Alliance, Brown was acceptable to most agrarian interests, while the Louisville and Nashville Railroad felt he was a moderate on the issue of corporate regulation.Ireland, p. 124 Bourbon Democrats were also pleased with his sound money stand. Entering the Democratic nominating convention, Brown seemed to be the favorite for the nomination. On the first ballot, he garnered the most votes (275), leading Clay (264), Clardy (190), and Hardin (186). Over the next nine ballots, the vote counts changed little. Finally, the convention chairman announced that the candidate receiving the fewest votes on the next ballot would be dropped from the voting. Clardy received the fewest votes, and on the next ballot, his supporters divided almost equally between the remaining three candidates. Hardin was the next candidate to be dropped, and Brown received a majority over Clay on the thirteenth ballot. The Republicans nominated Andrew T. Wood, a lawyer from Mount Sterling, who had failed in earlier elections for Congress and state attorney general. Concurrently with the gubernatorial election, the state's voters would decide whether to ratify a proposed new constitution for the state in 1891. The divided Democrats had taken no stand on the document as part of their convention's platform, and Wood spent much of the campaign trying to get Brown to declare his support for or opposition to it. About six weeks before the election, Brown, sensing strong public support for the new constitution, finally came out in favor of it. For the remainder of the race, Wood touted an alleged conspiracy between Brown and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad to thwart meaningful corporate regulations, but the issue failed to gain much traction. Both Democrats and Republicans were concerned about the presence of S. Brewer Erwin, nominee of the newly formed Populist Party, in the race; he enjoyed strong support for a third-party candidate, despite the fact that many believed his party's platform was too radical. Democrats, who were used to carrying the agrarian vote by a wide margin, were especially concerned that the Farmers' Alliance, consisting of over 125,000 members in Kentucky, would endorse Erwin. This did not occur, however, and in the general election, Brown defeated Wood by a vote of 144,168 to 116,087. Though he won the election, Brown had not won a majority of the votes; Populist Erwin captured 25,631 votes ‚Äì 9 percent of the total cast ‚Äì and a Prohibition candidate received 3,292 votes. Governor of Kentucky Turmoil marked the legislative sessions of Brown's term; his supporters had been either unwilling or unable to influence the rest of the Democratic slate, and tensions over the currency issue soon split the administration. Attorney General William Jackson Hendricks, Treasurer Henry S. Hale, and Auditor Luke C. Norman were all free silver supporters and feuded with Brown and his (appointed) secretary of state, John W. Headley, throughout Brown's term. Over time, the rift deepened and spread to the entire Democratic party.Tapp and Klotter, p. 325 Brown also frequently clashed with the legislature and vetoed several of the bills it passed; none of his vetoes were ever overridden. When the General Assembly convened on the last day of 1891, Brown reported that he had appointed a commission to study the impact of the new constitution on the state's existing laws.Tapp and Klotter, p. 326 He also announced that the state's present budget deficit was $229,000 and was expected to reach almost half a million dollars by the end of 1893. With these two large issues facing it, the Assembly was in session almost continuously from December 1891 to July 1893.Harrison in A New History of Kentucky, p. 267 The length of the session earned it a derisive nickname ‚Äì the \\"Long Parliament\\". Part of the reason for the extended session was each chamber's difficulty in achieving a quorum; a Louisville newspaper reported that, for an entire month, the largest attendance in the House of Representatives was 61 of 100 members. Consequently, some bills were passed by a plurality instead of a majority of the legislators.Tapp and Klotter, p. 328 Fearing that these bills would be challenged in court, Brown vetoed them. During the session, Brown secured the termination of a statewide geological survey, deeming it too expensive. By constitutional mandate, the regular session ended August 16, but Brown convened a special session of the legislature on August 25 because important bills that he had vetoed needed to be rewritten and passed, and because some bills he had signed needed to be amended to comply with the new constitution. Major legislation advocated by Brown and passed by the General Assembly included improvements in tax collection processes and tighter controls on corporations.\\"Kentucky Governor John Young Brown\\". National Governors Association Among the measures not specifically advocated by Brown that were enacted by the General Assembly was a measure racially segregating the state's railroad cars, called the \\"separate coach law\\". The special session lasted until November 1.Tapp and Klotter, p. 327 Brown won acclaim from the railroad companies for vetoing a proposed railroad tax increase, but soon drew their ire for preventing the merger of the state's two largest railways, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad and the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway. The Mason and Foard Company, which leased convict labor to build railroads, resented Brown's prison reforms. Brown accused his predecessor, Simon Bolivar Buckner, of illegally allowing Mason and Foard to use convict labor, a charge Buckner vehemently denied. During the 1894 legislative session, Brown advocated and won passage of several government efficiency measures, including a bill to transfer certain state governmental expenses to the counties, a bill to reform state printing contracts, and measures clarifying laws governing asylums and charitable institutions. The most significant bill, and the one that generated the most debate, was a law giving married women individual property rights for the first time in state history.Tapp and Klotter, p. 334 Other measures passed during the session included a basic coal safety measure, a common school statute, a measure prohibiting collusive bidding on tobacco, new regulations on grain warehouses, and a law providing free turnpikes.Ireland, p. 125 Measures advocated by Brown but not enacted by the Assembly included broadening the powers of the state railroad commission, establishing the offices of state bank inspector and superintendent of public printing, and reforming prison management, including separate detention of adolescent criminals. Brown also lobbied for the abolition of the state parole board; when the Assembly refused, Brown vowed to ignore the board's recommendations. Mob violence was prevalent in Kentucky during Brown's tenure as governor. From 1892 to 1895, there were fifty-six lynchings in the state. During one notable incident, a Cincinnati judge refused to extradite a black man suspected of shooting a white man in Kentucky. The judge's decision was based on his opinion that the accused was likely to be the victim of mob violence if returned to Kentucky. In disputing the judge's decision, Governor Brown attempted to justify some of the violence that had occurred in the state's past, declaring \\"It is much to be regretted that we have occasionally had mob violence in this Commonwealth, but it has always been when the passions of the people have been inflamed by the commission of the most atrocious crimes.\\"Wright, pp. 172‚Äì174 Later life and death It was widely known that Brown desired election to the U.S. Senate when his gubernatorial term expired in 1896.Clark and Lane, p. 63 The leading Democratic candidates to succeed Brown as governor were his old rivals, Cassius M. Clay, Jr. and Parker Watkins Hardin, and Brown believed he would need his eventual successor's support to secure the Senate seat. Having already alienated Hardin and his free silver allies, Brown threw his support to Clay. Family tragedy would soon remove his interest in the race, however. On October 30, 1894, Brown's teenage daughter Susan died of tuberculosis. A few months later, his son, Archibald Dixon Brown, divorced his wife; it was subsequently discovered that he had been carrying on an extramarital affair. Acting on an anonymous tip, his lover's husband found the couple at a brothel in Louisville; drawing his pistol, he shot his wife and Archibald Brown, killing them both. Of the series of family tragedies, Governor Brown wrote to Clay, \\"I shall not be a candidate for the Senate. The calamities of my children, which have recently befallen, have utterly unfitted me for the contest. My grief is so severe that, like a black vampire of the night, it seems to have sucked dry the very arteries and veins of my ambition.\\" Clay went on to lose the nomination to Hardin. Brown refused to endorse Hardin, and the fractured Democratic party watched as the Republicans elected William O. Bradley, the party's first-ever governor of Kentucky.Ireland, p. 126 Despite Brown's proclaimed lack of interest in the Senate seat, he received one vote during the tumultuous 1896 Senate election to replace Senator J. C. S. Blackburn.Tapp and Klotter, p. 357 William Goebel's nomination drew Brown into the 1899 gubernatorial race. After his term as governor, Brown again returned to his legal practice in Louisville. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the House of Representatives in 1896, losing to Republican Walter Evans. He would later claim that he had only run in order to improve Democratic voter turnout for William Jennings Bryan's 1896 presidential bid.Hughes, Schaefer, and Williams, p. 67 Prior to the 1899 Democratic nominating convention, Brown was mentioned as a possible gubernatorial nominee, but he declined to become a candidate.Hughes, Schaefer, and Williams, p. 13 When the convention began, he was mentioned as a candidate for convention chairman, but he also refused to serve in this capacity.Tapp and Klotter, p. 418 Despite his proclaimed lack of interest in the gubernatorial nomination, Brown's name was entered as a candidate on the first ballot, along with Parker Watkins Hardin, former Congressman William J. Stone, and William Goebel, President Pro Tempore of the state senate. The convention was thrown into chaos when a widely known agreement between Stone and Goebel ‚Äì designed to get Hardin out of the race ‚Äì broke down. As balloting continued over the next four days (Sunday excepted) with no candidate receiving a majority, Brown continued to receive a few votes on each ballot. Finally, the convention delegates decided to drop the candidate with the lowest vote total until one candidate received a majority; this resulted in the nomination of Goebel a few ballots later.Hughes, Schaefer, and Williams, pp. 30, 36, 38‚Äì39 Following the convention, disgruntled Democrats began to talk about rejecting their party's nominee and holding another nominating convention.Hughes, Schaefer, and Williams, p. 46 Brown became the leader of this group, styled the \\"Honest Election League\\".Tapp and Klotter, p. 428 Plans for the new convention were made at a meeting held August 2, 1899, in Lexington, Kentucky.Hughes, Schaefer, and Williams, p. 59 The nomination was made official at a convention held in that city on August 16.Hughes, Schaefer, and Williams, p. 60 In addition to Brown, the Honest Election League nominated a full slate of candidates for the other state offices.Hughes, Schaefer, and Williams, p. 69 Brown opened his campaign with a speech at Bowling Green on August 26, 1899. He answered many allegations that had been made about him, including claims that he had secretly been seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination all along, that he had ambitions of succeeding Senator William Joseph Deboe, and that following the nominating convention, he had agreed to speak on behalf of the Goebel ticket. Brown conceded that he desired Senator Deboe's senate seat and that he had agreed to accept the gubernatorial nomination if it had been offered to him, but he denied that he had ever agreed to speak on Goebel's behalf. Outgoing Senator Blackburn also charged that Brown was bolting the party again, just as he had in supporting Stephen Douglas over John C. Breckinridge for president in 1860. Brown replied by quoting an article by William Jennings Bryan's Omaha World-Herald that asserted the right of an individual to vote against the nominee of his party if the individual deemed the nominee unfit.Hughes, Schaefer, and Williams, pp. 70‚Äì71 Due to his age and ill health, Brown was able to speak only once per week. At a campaign event in Madisonville, he challenged Goebel to a debate, but Goebel ignored the challenge. Brown, and other speakers enlisted on behalf of his campaign, frequently called attention to Goebel's refusal to acknowledge the challenge or agree to a debate. When William Jennings Bryan came to the state to campaign with Goebel, Brown sent him a letter challenging him to repudiate Goebel's nomination because of the broken agreement between Goebel and Stone. Bryan refused to comment on the events of the convention and stressed the importance of party loyalty. He denounced the Honest Election League's convention as irregular and invalid.Hughes, Schaefer, and Williams, pp. 71, 77 94‚Äì96 Brown's campaign faltered as the race drew to a close. Two weeks prior to the election, Brown was injured in a fall at Leitchfield; as a result of the injury, he was confined to his home and unable to deliver campaign speeches, despite several attempts to allow him to speak from a chair or wheelchair. The final vote count gave Republican William S. Taylor a small plurality with 193,714 votes to Goebel's 191,331; Brown garnered only 12,140 votes.Hughes, Schaefer, and Williams, pp. 111, 146 Goebel challenged the vote returns in several counties.Klotter, p. 377 While the challenges were being adjudicated, Goebel was shot by an unknown assassin; Goebel was ultimately declared the winner of the election, but died of his wounds two days after being sworn into office. Among those charged in Goebel's murder was Governor Taylor's Secretary of State, Caleb Powers. Powers employed Brown as his legal counsel during his first trial, which ended in a conviction in July 1900. Brown died January 11, 1904, in Henderson and was buried at the Fernwood Cemetery in that city. He was the namesake of, but not related to, 20th century Kentucky Congressman John Y.

Biography Treigle ( ) was born in New Orleans, the fifth and final child of a poor carpenter and his wife. Following his 1946 marriage to the former Loraine Siegel, the bass-baritone began vocal studies with the contralto Elisabeth Wood. In 1947, he made his operatic debut with the New Orleans Opera Association, as the Duke of Verona in Rom√©o et Juliette. Between 1949 and 1951, he attended Loyola University of the South's College of Music, while performing various roles with the local opera company. (Loyola's archives now preserve Treigle's personal papers.) In 1953, Treigle made his New York City Opera debut, as Colline in La boh√®me. Three years later, the bass-baritone scored his first significant success, as the tormented Reverend Olin Blitch, in the New York premiere of Floyd's Susannah. He made his European debut in this same opera, at the Brussels World's Fair, in 1958. In succeeding seasons, Treigle became arguably the top bass-baritone of the Americas, and was acclaimed as one of the world's foremost singing-actors. He sang in many experimental productions and participated in several important premieres, in operas by Einem, Copland, Moore, Floyd, Orff, Dallapiccola and Ward (The Crucible). Perhaps his greatest roles were in Faust (as M√©phistoph√©l√®s), Carmen (as Escamillo), Susannah, Il prigioniero, Les contes d'Hoffmann (the four Villains), Boris Godunov and, especially, Mefistofele. Strange Child of Chaos: Norman Treigle. In the autumn of 1974, Treigle made his debut at Covent Garden in a new production of Faust. On February 16, 1975, Treigle was found dead in his New Orleans apartment. He had been diagnosed as a chronic insomniac, and it was determined that he had consumed an accidental overdose of sleeping pills. By his first wife (who died in 2013), he had a son (who died in 1993) and a daughter, Phyllis. He had also adopted the daughter of his second wife, from whom he was separated at the time of his death. Phyllis Treigle is a soprano who appeared with the New Orleans Opera and the New York City Opera.  Treigle Plaza  On October 12, 2012, Treigle Plaza was dedicated, in the presence of Phyllis Treigle and Audrey Schuh. It is the elevated area in front of the Mahalia Jackson Theater of the Performing Arts, in New Orleans, including the great fountain. The Dedication ceremony preceded a Gala Concert, by the New Orleans Opera, starring Pl√°cido Domingo, with Patricia Clarkson as hostess.

The game was never released outside Japan. Gameplay In-game screenshot Sutte Hakkun falls into the category of a side-scrolling, level-based action puzzle game; a genre best represented by the Lode Runner series. The player controls Hakkun, and attempts to gather up the rainbow shards distributed across each level. A level is completed when the player finds all of the shards hidden in the level. Levels are arranged simplistically at the start of the game, but become highly complex and difficult near the end. The final goal is to find all of the shards hidden in the game. Hakkun's actions consist of three movements; running to the left or right, jumping, and absorbing or depositing blocks. A combination of these is required to complete each level. The player must restart the level if Hakkun falls into a hole or touches spike traps, but there are no other impediments, such as time limits or enemy characters, towards completing each level. There are also no lives or game over screens, and the more difficult later levels are completed by repeatedly searching the level for the solution to the puzzle. Completion of the game requires a combination of puzzle-solving ability and precise control of Hakkun by the player. Several types of traps and characters are prepared in each level, some of which help Hakkun, and others which may obstruct his path. The most important of these are the red, blue, and yellow bottles and transparent blocks. Hakkun can suck out colors from each bottle, and insert them into the transparent blocks to make them move in different directions. Series Five versions of the game exist; four of which were released over Satellaview, and one in game cartridge format. Of the four games for Satellaview, the event version and BS version 2 were broadcast up until June, 2000, when Satellaview service ended permanently. * Sutte Hakkun Event Version - broadcast started November 2, 1997. :The game was first released as the November portion of the Satellaview monthly game contest, and consisted of 50 levels with 5 additional bonus levels. The game data takes all of the 8M memory pack for Satellaview; a large amount of memory for a data broadcast. The game was re-broadcast later with a rankings system. This was the first game ever created by Indieszero, but the company name never appears in the game itself. * Sutte Hakkun (for Nintendo Power) - broadcast started August 1, 1998, discontinued February 28, 2007. :This new version was released exclusively for Nintendo Power. Initially offered for 3,000 yen, the price was lowered to 2,000 yen the following year. This commercial version featured considerable improvements in graphics and a large increase in length (110 levels). The end credits showed the Indieszero logo and name for the first time. * Sutte Hakkun BS Version 2 - broadcast started October, 1998. :This version was also released for Satellaview, and was a remake of the event version with new puzzles. It consisted of 30 levels and 3 bonus levels. There was no rankings system included in this release. * Sutte Hakkun '98 Winter Event Version - broadcast started December 20, 1998. :This was the last version released for Satellaview. Similar to the BS version, it was a remake of the first with new puzzles (30 levels + 3 bonus levels). The graphic themes center around Winter and Christmas. * Sutte Hakkun (for ROM cartridge) - released June 25, 1999. :The final release was a cartridge version of the 1998 Nintendo Power release, which sold for 4,200 yen. The content of the game is identical to that of the previous release, but a detailed instruction manual with various tips and tricks was included with the game. Development In response to the significant decrease in the number of original games presented over Satellaview's \\"Super Famicom Hour\\" data broadcast in 1996, Nintendo began the \\"Monthly Game Event\\" series in 1997, where a new game would be broadcast each month for the Super Famicom. However, many of these were rereleases of older games such as Dr. Mario and F-Zero. The intricate puzzles and user-friendly tutorial made Sutte Hakkun considered by most Satellaview consumers in Japan one of the most popular games ever released for the Satellaview. The game was produced by Masayuki Uemura,„Ç≤„Éº„É†ÂÜÖ„ÅÆ„Çπ„Çø„ÉÉ„Éï„É≠„Éº„É´„ÅØ„É≠„Éº„ÉûÂ≠óË°®Ë®ò„ÄÅ„É≠„É†„Ç´„Çª„ÉÉ„ÉàÁâàË™¨ÊòéÊõ∏„ÅÆ„Çπ„Çø„ÉÉ„ÉïÁ¥π‰ªã„Åß„ÅØÂπ≥‰ªÆÂêçË°®Ë®ò„ÅÆ„Åü„ÇÅ„ÄÅÊº¢Â≠óË°®Ë®ò„ÅØ‰∏çÊòé„ÄÇ composed by Akito Nakatsuka, designed by Nobuaki Tanaka, directed by Masayu Nakata, and programmed by Keiji Hara. Software for the Famicom Disk System that the third stage participant of had produced is assumed to be a prototype established by the graduate of Indiezero. This work became the debut work of Indieszero. The positive response to the game led to a commercial release in 1998. The game was made available for Nintendo Power; a data writing service offered at Lawson convenience stores. Taking advantage of the larger memory of the Nintendo Power cartridge, (3 times that of Satellaview) the creators not only expanded the number of puzzles, but added a more in-depth tutorial, and additional hints towards completing the game. However, the decline of the Super Famicom and the lack of availability of Nintendo Power cartridges prevented the game from reaching a mainstream audience. The game was still well received among former Satellaview users and hardcore Nintendo fans. Points were recorded in a rankings system in the original Satellaview broadcast, and were posted on Nintendo's website until 2009. The cartridge version was released in 1999 to counter this lack of availability, but many stores had already stopped importing Super Famicom games, and availability ended up being more limited than before. In the few stores where the game was sold, overstock caused the price to drop dramatically, and the game ended up with a lowered price around 1,000 yen (the original price was 4,200 yen). Because of these circumstances, the game's mainstream popularity remains extremely low. In 2017 an English fan translation of the game was released. In 2020, ROMs for unreleased Game Boy and Game Boy Color ports of the game were found in a Nintendo source code leak.https://www.kotaku.com.au/2020/09/new- nintendo-leak-includes-several-unreleased-game-boy- games/https://vandal.elespanol.com/noticia/1350737926/se-filtran-multitud-de- proyectos-que-fueron-cancelados-para-game-boy-y-game-boy-color/ Reception Upon release, Famitsu gave the SFC version of the game a score of 28 out of 40.

Even the U-Bahn and S-Bahn announcements use the unofficial name. Architecture The most important buildings dominating the square are on the east side of the Karlstor, a gothic gate of the demolished medieval fortifications together with the rondell buildings on both sides of the gate (constructed by Gabriel von Seidl 1899-1902). The gate was first documented in 1301 and called Neuhauser Tor until 1791 when it was renamed Karlstor in honor of Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria. During the summer, a large fountain operates in front of the Karlstor and in winter an open-air ice rink is installed there. The most significant buildings on the opposite west side are the neo-baroque Justizpalast (Palace of Justice) and the Kaufhof, the first postwar department store built in Munich (by Theo Pabst, 1950-1951). A new building is planned for the Hotel K√∂nigshof. The underground contains a large shopping center.

History  Monster Voodoo Machine was formed in Canada in 1991 by Toronto musician and vocalist Adam Sewell, inspired by bands like Quicksand, Black Flag and Discharge. The original line-up included guitarist Mark Gibson, bassist Terry Landry and drummer Drew Gauley. In their first six months together the band recorded one EP (\\"Burn\\" ‚Äì released on Epidemic Records in 1992) and one full- length album (\\"Turbine\\", which was not released) and filmed two promotional videos: \\"3 Year Plan\\" and \\"Bastard Child\\". The band also collaborated with techno group BTK (\\"Bastard Child ‚Äì Techno Storm Mix\\") and begin recording sessions with soul singers. Over the next year the band added second guitarist Dave Rose and keyboardist Stacey Hoskin to the line-up, but the intense pace of touring and writing led to both guitarists Gibson and Rose leaving, replaced by Jason Cuddy (previously of Mundane) and Darren Quinn. Gauley also left after several tours, later himself joining Mundane, and was replaced on drums by Dean Dallas Bentley. In late 1993 the band recorded their second EP and major-label debut \\"State Voodoo/State Control\\" (released in 1994 on RCA Records). Produced by Paul Raven (of Killing Joke and Prong) and Walter Sobczak,https://www.discogs.com/Monster-Voodoo-Machine-State-Voodoo-State- Control/release/485430http://www.allmusic.com/album/state-voodoo-state- control-mw0000107668/credits the EP's title was a reference to the Discharge track \\"State Violence State Control\\". Musically, the EP saw the band move in a heavier and darker direction, similar to bands like White Zombie and Ministry. The EP also featured remixes from producers including Danny Saber (U2). In late January 1994 the band relocated to Chicago to record their first full- length album Suffersystem, produced by Critter and Howie Beno at Chicago Trax studios. The album featured several guest appearances including Roddy Bottum of Faith No More, Leslie Rankin of Silverfish and Ruby, and Wesley Willis. On completing the album in the late spring, the band set out on a tour of around 500 shows, touring with Carcass, Life of Agony, Skrew, and Fight, before touring with Marilyn Manson in early 1995, on the two and a half month \\"Portrait of an American Family Tour\\". Suffersystem won the 1995 Juno Award for \\"Best Hard Rock Album Of The Year\\". Around this time, the band also released a number of singles and EPs featuring remixes by artists such as Biohazard, DJ Muggs, KMFDM and Pigface. Sewell asked RCA to have the Chemical Brothers or Liam Howlett of The Prodigy produce the next album, but RCA declined, asking the band instead to consider Butch Vig. Disillusioned with RCA, Sewell asked to be released from their recording contract. In late 1995, the band was put \\"on hold\\" for the next year. The band returned in 1996 joined by Soulstorm members Nick Sagias (keyboards) and bassist Chris Harris. They released 1,000 numbered copies of \\"Pirate Satellite\\". However, shortly after that, the band announced that they were breaking up, and on October 4, 1996 they played a farewell show at the Volcano Club in Kitchener, Ontario. Less than a year later, while on tour with def.con.sound.system. in 1997, Sewell was offered a record deal by Dr. Dream Records (a subsidiary of Polygram / Mercury) who suggested that the group use the Monster Voodoo Machine name. At the time def.con.sound.system. featured Sewell, Cuddy, Sagias, Harris and occasionally Quinn and Bentley, so the agreed and began planning a new album. As the group began working on new material, Sewell decided to record the album without the use of samplers, keyboards or drum loops. The resulting album Direct Reaction Now! featured several def.con.sound.system. songs reworked into a rock format.

It originally aired on February 24, 2004 on NBC. It features Brendan Fraser's final appearance as Ben Sullivan. The character had previously appeared in the Season 1 episodes \\"My Occurrence\\" and \\"My Hero\\". Critical reaction was very positive. Most notably, the episode was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series. Plot Jordan and Dr. Cox are preparing to throw a party for their son Jack's first birthday. Dr. Cox advises J.D. not to attend the party because Jordan's sister Danni, with whom J.D. had recently broken up, is also coming. Also coming to the party is Jordan and Danni's brother Ben (Brendan Fraser), whose cancer has gone into remission; however, he has failed to have routine screenings and Cox advises him to get checked out. Meanwhile, Turk and Carla clash over removing a mole from Turk's face and Carla taking Turk as her last name after they marry, and one of Ted's band members quits. J.D. is taking care of an elderly man with an irregular heartbeat when Dr. Cox instructs him to run tests on Ben while Cox runs an errand. Twenty minutes later, J.D. is called to resuscitate a patient who has gone into cardiac arrest. When Dr. Cox returns, J.D. hands him a chart and informs him that the patient died. Dr. Cox angrily blames J.D. and sends him home, despite Ben's efforts to convince Cox that it wasn't J.D.'s fault. Two days later, Cox has been at the hospital for sixty straight hours and it is apparent that Jordan is worried he won't show up for their big event later that day. Ben follows Cox around the hospital, apparently trying to convince him to go, but he claims to have a rule of thumb against attending \\"parties where the guest of honor has no idea of what's going on\\". Meanwhile, Carla is busy annoying everyone as she is looking for advice: first she is upset because she doesn't know what to do to repay Turk for having his mole removed, but when he asks her to agree to take his name (hoping she would say no so he wouldn't have to have the surgery) she gladly accepts his terms. But after that she is angry that Turk is 'forcing her' to take his name. She asks an annoyed Dr. Kelso for advice; he responds that she may end up missing the mole after it's gone, even though she thinks she hates it. She finally decides that Turk shouldn't have to have his mole removed, and Turk respects her wishes to keep her own last name. Ben finally gets Dr. Cox to leave the hospital to attend the event, as well as apologize to J.D. for blaming him for the patient's death, and on the way to the gathering tells him to forgive himself. After Dr. Cox asks why Ben doesn't have his camera with him, J.D. arrives and brings Cox to the realization that not only is he not actually attending his son's birthday party, but also that Ben is not present. Cox and J.D. are revealed to be at a cemetery where they are joined by Jordan, Danni, and many of the hospital staff for what is revealed to be Ben's funeral. In reality, Ben was the patient who died under J.D.'s watch. Cox, unable to accept the death of his best friend, had been seeing Ben's spirit as if he were alive. The episode ends as a heartbroken Dr. Cox uncharacteristically allows those around to comfort him. Homage to The Sixth Sense In the special features on the Season 3 DVD, Bill Lawrence says that this episode is a homage to The Sixth Sense. The film, starring Bruce Willis, is famous for its twist ending, when it is revealed that Willis' character has been dead throughout the film. In the film, Willis interacts only with a boy who can \\"see dead people\\"; no other characters ever acknowledge Willis' presence. The film allows the audience to assume Willis is alive. Similarly, the audience in \\"My Screw Up\\" is led to believe that Ben is alive until the very end, even as close examination reveals that Dr. Cox is the only character who acknowledges him after the point in the episode when he dies. Ben says early in the episode that he will take his camera with him everywhere until the day he dies. After \\"the patient\\" dies, Ben doesn't have his camera for the rest of the episode. Continuity Footage from this episode was later re-used in \\"My Urologist\\", with Dr. Kim Briggs digitally worked into it (replacing Carla) to verify she was there for Ben's funeral. Brendan Fraser was supposed to appear in \\"My Long Goodbye\\" as Ben, when Carla asked Dr. Cox if he had ever seen a ghost. However, Fraser couldn't appear because he was filming a movie. As such, Jill Tracy from \\"My Lunch\\" appears instead.Scrubs TV Show Series on NBC: Find Videos and Season Episode . NBC Online Site Ben had previously appeared in two Season 1 episodes: \\"My Occurrence\\" and \\"My Hero\\". It is in these two episodes that Ben was diagnosed with leukemia. In the former, J.D. himself goes through an incident similar to Dr. Cox's and imagines a series of events in which he proves Ben is misdiagnosed and actually well, before realizing it is a fantasy and Ben in fact has leukemia.

But Now They're Content to Wear Stars on Their Brows is the debut album by psychedelic folk band Tyrannosaurus Rex (later known as T. Rex). It was released on 5 July 1968 by record label Regal Zonophone. Recording My People Were Fair was recorded at Advision Studios in London, England in early 1968 and produced by Tony Visconti. Preparatory demo sessions for the album took place at Visconti's London flat as well as studio sessions with producer Joe Boyd. Advision was the first studio in the UK with eight-channel recording equipment. This Advision eight-channel machine was a model 280 made by Scully Recording Instruments, which allowed for far greater recording flexibility than the standard 4-track recorders of the era. Two of the songs, \\"Mustang Ford\\" (retitled from \\"Go Go Girl\\") and \\"Hot Rod Mama\\" (a live BBC radio session) had been recorded earlier by Marc Bolan's pre-Tyrannosaurus Rex band John's Children. Early versions of some of the tracks also appeared on The Beginning of Doves, a collection of demos and early tracks released in 1974. Music The record featured Bolan on vocals and guitars, and Steve Peregrin Took on backing vocals, drums, pixiphone and percussion. It also featured disc jockey John Peel, who read a children's story written by Bolan for the album's closing track, \\"Frowning Atahuallpa (My Inca Love)\\", which also included a lengthy Hare Krishna chant. For Bolan, the album's music represented a rejection of the electric guitar-driven music he'd been playing with his previous band, John's Children. The cover art (by George Underwood) and subject matter of many of the songs dealt with the fantasy themes that would pervade much of the subsequent Tyrannosaurus Rex catalogue. Cover art The cover artwork is an illustration by George Underwood, based on Gustave Dor√©'s illustrations of Dante's Inferno. Release My People Were Fair was released on 5 July 1968 by Regal Zonophone. It reached No. 15 in the UK Album Chart upon initial release. The album was paired with Tyrannosaurus Rex's follow-up album Prophets, Seers & Sages: The Angels of the Ages (1968) and released in 1972 as a double album, following the success of T. Rex's Electric Warrior (1971) and The Slider (1972) albums. It reached No. 1 in the UK. The double release remains the longest album title of any UK No. 1 album. In the US it was released by A&M; Records as Tyrannosaurus Rex: A Beginning. In 1985 it was re-released on Sierra Records. An expanded edition CD was released in 2004, which included the mono mix of the album, one single track and three alternate studio takes. A new mono mix was created for a deluxe edition, released in January 2015, which also included home demos for the album recorded by Visconti and exploratory studio sessions with Boyd. Reception The album received negative reviews upon its release. In his retrospective review, Dave Thompson, writing for AllMusic, called it \\"an irresistible affair, if absolutely a child of its psychedelically-inclined time\\".

It may also occur in northern Afghanistan and Iran and occasionally the steppe regions of Romania and Hungary. The German name is Steppenwolf, whence the novel (1927) by the German author Hermann Hesse got its name. Studies have shown that this type of wolf is known to carry rabies. Due to its close proximity to domestic animals the need for a reliable vaccination is high. Rueness et al. (2014) showed that wolves in the Caucasus Mountains of the putative Caucasian subspecies, C. l. cubanensis, are not genetically distinct enough to be considered a subspecies, but may represent a local ecomorph of C. l. lupus. In Kazakhstan, villagers keep them as guard animals.  Appearance  It is of average dimensions, weighing 35‚Äì40 kg (77‚Äì88 lbs), thus being somewhat smaller than the Eurasian wolf and its fur is sparser, coarser and shorter. The flanks are light grey, and the back is rusty grey or brownish with a strong admixture of black hairs. The guard hairs on the withers usually do not exceed 70‚Äì75 mm. The fur of steppe wolves in Middle Asia and Kazakhstan tends to have more reddish tones. The tail is poorly furred. The skull is 224‚Äì272 mm long and 128‚Äì152 mm wide.

History  = Early Solt = The region has been populated since the Stone Age. The results of diggings brought up Roman coins, weapons, and bodies. The road from the province of Pannonia to Dacia cut through Solt. The first written documents mentioning Solt date back to 1145. Solt was under the jurisdiction of the bishop of Kalocsa from the 11th until the 13th century. = Local legend = There is a local legend about the establishment of Solt. It is called the Legend of the Golden Key. According to the legend, B√©la IV of Hungary gave two golden keys to the town of Solt for hiding him from the invading Mongolian tribes. The keys were hidden on top of the local Presbyterian church which was hit by lightning. The keys melted and were never found again. Since then they are only seen in the seal of the town. = Middle Ages = When Hungary was occupied by the Ottoman Empire, Solt lost much of its population. The town is mentioned many times during the Hungarian uprising against the Habsburgs; Francis II R√°k√≥czi kept his army in the region. In the second half of the 18th century, the North Hungarian nobility purchased the town and the surrounding area. The castles of Baron R√©vay, Graf Berchtold, Graf Nemes, Graf V√©csey, Graf Benyovszky, Graf Czebri√°n, Graf Pongr√°cz, and the Graf Teleki family were built in the 19th century. During the Revolution of 1848 Solt was an important camp of the Hungarian soldiers. = 20th Century = Hungary lost both world wars which caused death and destruction in Solt. Afterwards, the country was occupied by the Soviet army and communism spread quickly. Finally, after 1989, Hungary regained her independence and Solt started to rise again. The town is now home to many independent businesses. In the 1970s, a 2000 kW medium-wave broadcasting station called Transmitter Solt was built.

Only 33 remain in captivity in Montana thanks to the efforts of Dr. E.H. McCleery of Kane, PA who purchased 20 from the U.S. Government. They are described as a large, light-colored wolf but with black and white varying between individual wolves, with some all white or all black. The Native Americans of North Dakota told of how only three of these wolves could bring down any sized bison. Taxonomy This wolf was first recorded in 1823 by the naturalist Thomas Say in his writings on Major Stephen Long's expedition to the Great Plains. Say was the first person to document the difference between a \\"prairie wolf\\" (coyote) and on the next page of his journal a wolf which he named Canis nubilus. He described one of these wolves that had been caught in a trap: In 1995, the American mammalogist Robert M. Nowak analyzed data on the skull morphology of wolf specimens from around the world. For North America, he proposed that there were only five subspecies of gray wolf. One of these he described as a moderate-sized wolf that was originally found from Texas to Hudson Bay and from Oregon to New Foundland which he named C. l. nubilus. This proposal was not recognized in the taxonomic authority Mammal Species of the World (2005), which classified this wolf as one of the 27 subspecies of Canis lupus in North America. =Lineage= \\"Roping gray wolf\\" - John C. H. Grabill photograph 1887 Gray wolves (Canis lupus) migrated from Eurasia into North America 70,000‚Äì23,000 years ago and gave rise to at least two morphologically and genetically distinct groups. One group is represented by the extinct Beringian wolf and the other by the modern populations. A haplotype is a group of genes found in an organism that are inherited together from one of their parents. Mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) passes along the maternal line and can date back thousands of years. A 2005 study compared the mitochondrial DNA sequences of modern wolves from across North America with those from thirty-four specimens dated between 1856 and 1915 collected from the western United States, Mexico and the Labrador Peninsula. The historic population was found to possess twice the genetic diversity of modern wolves, which suggests that the mDNA diversity of the wolves eradicated from the western US was more than twice that of the modern population. Some haplotypes possessed by the Mexican wolf, the extinct Southern Rocky Mountain wolf and the extinct Great Plains wolf were found to form a unique \\"southern clade\\". All North American wolves group together with those from Eurasia, except for the southern clade which form a group exclusive to North America. The wide distribution area of the southern clade indicates that gene flow was extensive across the recognized limits of its subspecies. A study published in 2018 looked at the limb morphology of modern and fossil North American wolves. The major limb bones of the dire wolf, Beringian wolf, and most modern North American gray wolves can be clearly distinguished from one another. Late Pleistocene wolves on both sides of the Laurentide Ice Sheet ‚Äî Cordilleran Ice Sheet possessed shorter legs when compared with most modern wolves. The Late Pleistocene wolves from the Natural Trap Cave, Wyoming and Rancho La Brea, southern California were similar in limb morphology to the Beringian wolves of Alaska. Modern wolves in the Midwestern USA and northwestern North America possess longer legs that evolved during the Holocene, possibly driven by the loss of slower prey. However, shorter legs survived well into the Holocene after the extinction of much of the Pleistocene megafauna, including the Beringian wolf. Holocene wolves from Middle Butte Cave (dated less than 7,600 YBP) and Moonshiner Cave (dated over 3,000 YBP) in Bingham County, Idaho were similar to the Beringian wolves. The Mexican wolf (C. l. baileyi) and pre-1900 samples of the Great Plains wolf (Canis lupus nubilus) resembled the Late Pleistocene and Holocene fossil gray wolves due to their shorter legs. Description Buffalo Hunt, White Wolves Attacking Buffalo Bull - George Catlin 1844 The Great Plains wolf's distribution once extended throughout the Great Plains from southern Manitoba and Saskatchewan southward to northern Texas. They are described as a large, light-colored wolf but with black and white varying between individual wolves, with some all white or all black. The body length is with a weight of the male averaging and the heaviest recorded at . The Indians of North Dakota told of how only three of these wolves could bring down a buffalo, including a large old bull. Early records indicate C. l. nubilus being very abundant throughout the Great Plains. After the disappearance of the buffalo (Bison bison) they were poisoned and trapped for their pelts until few remained. The pioneer Alexander Henry wrote about these wolves several times during his trips to North Dakota, noting how they fed extensively on buffalo carcasses. They were bold around humans, sometimes approaching people and entering their tents while they slept. He recorded that Indians occasionally dug up wolf pups from their prairie dens and dug large pitfalls to capture wolves and foxes. Members of his group dug up wolf pups and found them very tame and easy to train. In 1833 Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied recorded that these wolves were common in the upper Missouri, where the Indians operated wolf pits and traded wolves to him in exchange for two rolls of tobacco each. He found the Indian's dogs to be more of a personal danger than the wolves. In 1856, Lt. G. K. Warren gathered together a collection of this wolf's skulls which now reside in the National Museum of Natural History. He noted that some wolf skull specimens appeared not to be full-blooded wolves as their molars indicated a hybrid. There have been many stories in this region about ferocious hybrid wolf-dogs, and it is possible that the wolf's tameness and lack of fear of humans might be due admixture with domestic dogs. In North Dakota, by 1875 sightings of the wolf became rare, by 1887 they were almost gone. On the Canadian Prairies, bounty payments for wolves commenced in 1878 in Manitoba, and 1899 in Saskatchewan and Alberta. In North Dakota, two were sighted in 1915 by Remington Kellogg. The last known wolf in the wild was shot in 1922. The Great Plains was declared extinct in the wild in 1926.

Seven units, numbered 1031-1037, were constructed in 1958 for use on the Southern Region. They were similar to the earlier Class 202 units, differing only in the substitution of a trailer buffet car for one of the three trailer second opens. Operations The units were delivered in 1958 in then-standard British Railways green livery. They worked initially on the Hastings‚ÄìTonbridge‚ÄìLondon /Cannon Street line. In 1963, the number of buffet cars was reduced to five to reflect falling demand, with units 1031 and 1032 losing the carriages; 1031 was converted to standard 6L (202) formation while 1032 lost another car to replace a damaged car in another unit and ran with two TFKs, downgraded to TSK, from Class 201; the rest of these units were used in the formation of 3R(206) \\"Tadpole\\" units 1201-1206.

In the show, a group of five men, known as \\"Team C2G\\", travelled around the United States trying to beat world records. This included shot-putting a tuba as far as they could, furthest distance jumping a hearse over a short bus, eating worms, beating a speed record of an unexpected item (such as the fastest living room space, built on a truck), blowing the biggest bubble gum ever, etc. According to CTV, the group broke 33 records during the filming of the show, individually and collectively. The cast members were Andreas Wigand, Drew Bell, Ghost, Paul Prado, and Rainbow Borden. The son of a preacher and an artist, ‚ÄúGhost‚Äù was born on February 28 in Indianapolis, Indiana. He later moved to Atlanta, Georgia, when he was a teenager. The most intense world record that was broken was done by Rainbow Borden. He drove an ATV 200 feet through a tunnel of fire. The two previous attempts at this very dangerous record resulted in death. The details of those fatalities are unknown. This record never aired on the show because MTV deemed it to deadly for television. It can be viewed on YouTube under \\"Bow Borden Tunnel of fire\\" In late 2006, Call to Greatness was moved to MTV2. The producers of the show decided not to continue on with the series after the move due to budget constraints.

According to the latest census, 1084 people live within this community. In its early days, the village developed out of local transport and agricultural trade via rail and ship and evolved mainly into a summer resort community, serving seasonal residences and summer cottagers through much of its history. The village is now home to mostly permanent residences and commuters supported by larger cities and towns such as Sarnia and Wallaceburg. Every Civic Holiday weekend in August the town hosts its annual Gala Days. This community is served by two elementary schools, several churches and a small service industry. The public school is Riverview Central School and the Catholic school is Sacred Heart. Until the mid-1980s Port Lambton served as a registered port of entry into Canada by means of a ferry crossing from nearby Roberts Landing, Michigan and docking facilities on much of the villages waterfront. Following the ending of ferry operations at Port Lambton, the former port facility and Customs office located at the foot of Stoddard Street on the St. Clair River was transferred to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. The federal government through the Canadian Coast Guard continues to operate the facility as a seasonal Inshore Rescue Boat Station. History The village of Port Lambton has its roots in the settlement of Baby's Point. Located just south of the village of Port Lambton, on the area that is now Brander Park, Baby's Point is the extreme southern point of Lambton County. Fran√ßois Baby owned all the land from this point, and all of Port Lambton site. Inherited from his grandfather in 1742. There also was a brother, Jacques Baby. Edward Kelly was the first postmaster at Baby's Point 1848. After 1812, people started to settle along the St. Clair River. Before few people lived there. They were French, and didn't have legal title to the land. When the Irish moved in, the French sold their squatters rights to the Irish in about 1833. The Natives could sell land only with the approval of the Province. Anyhow, soon after 1812, people bought up land legally along the St. Clair River. Port Lambton Park Port Lambton‚Äîliveliest little river-town South of Sarnia. Two of each, sawmills, grist mills, shoe shops, blacksmith shops.

In the spring of 1820, Duncan McDonald built the first frame house. Post office opened in 1871, one time known as Lambton Village. Rural mail was first delivered in 1908, and all mail routes completed in January 1909. The first Sacred Heart Church was built at Baby's Point around 1825. It burned. Father Monocq, secular priest, French, was drowned January 12, 1861, and the body was found in 1862. He was buried beneath the altar of the first Port Lambton Church. The plaque was on the right-hand of the side altar. The Sacred Heart Church, Port Lambton, was built in 1877. Martin Regan was the first person baptised there, December 1877.

(1976) was the first major-press short-story collection by American writer Raymond Carver. Described by contemporary critics as a foundational text of minimalist fiction, its stories offered an incisive and influential telling of disenchantment in the mid-century American working class. Publication history Cartoon invitation for a party celebrating the publication, by S. Clay Wilson.Unlike his later collections, the stories collected in Will You Please Be Quiet, Please? were written during a period Carver termed his \\"first life\\" or \\"Bad Raymond days\\", prior to his near-death from alcoholism and subsequent sobriety. The earliest compositions date from around 1960, the time of his study under John Gardner at Chico State in English 20A: Creative Writing. In the decade and a half following, Carver struggled to make space for bursts of creativity between teaching jobs and raising his two young children, and later, near-constant drinking. The compositions of Will You Please... can be grouped roughly into the following periods: * 1960‚Äì1961 ‚Äì \\"The Father\\" * 1960‚Äì1963 ‚Äì \\"The Ducks\\", \\"What Do You Do in San Francisco?\\" * 1964 ‚Äì \\"Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?\\", \\"The Student's Wife\\", \\"Sixty Acres\\" * 1967 ‚Äì \\"How About This?\\", \\"Signals\\", \\"Jerry and Molly and Sam\\" * 1970 ‚Äì \\"Neighbors\\", \\"Fat\\", \\"Night School\\", \\"The Idea\\", \\"Why, Honey?\\", \\"Nobody Said Anything\\", \\"Are You a Doctor?\\" * 1971 ‚Äì \\"What Is It?\\" (\\"Are These Actual Miles?\\"), \\"What's In Alaska?\\", \\"Bicycles, Muscles, Cigarettes\\", \\"They're Not Your Husband\\", \\"Put Yourself in My Shoes\\" * 1974 ‚Äì \\"Collectors\\" Although several of the stories had appeared previously in prominent publications (the Foley Collection had published the story \\"Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?\\" in 1967 and Esquire had accepted \\"Neighbors\\" in 1971), as the first author to be collected in the new McGraw-Hill imprint for fiction, this marked the first major commercial success of Carver's career. The title for the collection was originally proposed by Frederic W. Hills, editor at McGraw-Hill, as Put Yourself in My Shoes, and Gordon Lish, Carver's editor, agreed. However, after polling friends, Carver made a stand for the eventual title, under which Lish selected 22 of the more than 30 Carver had published to that date. Critical reception Following the success of experimental literary works by short story writers such as John Barth and Donald Barthelme in the early 1970s, Will You Please... was noted for its flat, understated incision in contemporary reviews. Publishers Weekly included in its first issue of 1976 a notice of the new collection, calling it \\"Downbeat but perceptive writing about the inarticulate worlds of Americans...\\" Later critical analysis orientated the collection in relation to the later editing conflicts with Gordon Lish in What We Talk About When We Talk About Love (1981), and the \\"expansiveness\\" of Cathedral (1983). Bethea's analysis of the collection focuses on the unreliability of the narrators in Will You Please..., finding humour and fraught realism in their dramas. The collection was chosen as one of five finalists for the 1977 National Book Award.http://nbafictionfinalists.squarespace.com/blog/2012/6/9/1977.html Plot summaries =‚ÄúFat‚Äù= A waitress recounts a story to her friend, about \\"the fattest person I have ever seen,\\" who comes into the diner where she works and orders a procession of dishes in a polite and self-deprecatory manner. The waitress notices his strange manner of speaking, commenting positively on every aspect of the massive meal. She describes the physical struggle of the fat man, his \\"puffing\\" and overheating. After recounting the events at the dinner, the waitress tells her friend how she tried to explain to her partner, Rudy, that \\"he is fat... but that is not the whole story\\". When they had sex that night, the waitress felt that she was \\"terrifically fat\\", and Rudy was \\"hardly there at all\\". The story ends on a note of anticipation, with the waitress thinking to herself: \\"It is August./ My life is going to change. I feel it.\\" =‚ÄúNeighbors‚Äù= A \\"happy couple\\" who feel life has passed by are asked to house-sit for their neighbors while they are away. As he is in the house across the hall, the husband (Bill) begins to enjoy the voyeuristic experience of exploring his neighbors' things, sampling the food in the fridge, and even trying on their clothes. After the wife (Arlene) spends an absent-minded hour in her neighbors' home, she returns to tell Bill that she has found some pictures he should see. \\"Maybe they won‚Äôt come back\\", she says, as they cross the hall together. Before they can enter the apartment, however, Arlene realises that she has left the key inside their flat, and the door handle will now not turn: locked. =‚ÄúThe Idea‚Äù= After supper, a couple watch through the window as their neighbor walks round the side of his house to spy on his own wife as she undresses. They seem puzzled at the incident, that has been happening \\"one out of every two to three nights\\" for the last three months. The man showers, as the woman prepares food for a late-night snack, telling her partner that would call the cops on anyone who looked in at her while she was undressing. As she scrapes waste food into the garbage, she sees a stream of ants coming from underneath the sink, which she sprays with bug killer. When she goes to bed, the man is asleep already, and she imagines the ants again. She gets up, turns all the lights on, sprays all over the house, and looks out the window, aghast, saying \\"...things I can't repeat.\\" =‚ÄúThey‚Äôre Not Your Husband‚Äù= Earl, a salesman between jobs, stops by one night at the 24-hour coffee shop where his wife, Doreen, works as a waitress. She is surprised to see him, but he reassures her and orders a coffee and sandwich. While he drinks his coffee, Earl overhears two men in business suits making crass comments about his wife. As she bends over to scoop ice cream, her skirt rides up and shows her thighs and girdle. Earl leaves and doesn't turn round when Doreen calls his name. The next day, Earl suggests Doreen think about going on a diet. Surprised, she agrees, and they research different diets and exercise. \\"Just quit eating... for a few days, anyway\\", he tells her. She agrees to try. As she loses weight, people at work comment that Doreen is looking pale. Earl insists that she ignore them, however, saying \\"You don't have to live with them.\\" One night after drinks, Earl goes back to the coffee shop and orders ice cream. As Doreen bends down, he asks the man next to him what he thinks, to the latter's shock. Another waitress notices Earl staring and asks Doreen who this is. \\"He's a salesman. He's my husband\\", she says. =‚ÄúAre You a Doctor?‚Äù= A man (Arnold), who is sitting alone in his house while his wife is away, gets a call from a woman who appears to have the wrong number. Upon checking the number, she hesitates, and asks the man's name. He tells her to throw the number away. However, she tells him she thinks they should meet and calls back later to repeat the suggestion. The next afternoon, the man receives a call from the same woman, asking him to come over to see her sick daughter. Arnold takes a cab over, climbs the stairs to the address, and finds a young girl at the door, who lets him in. After some time, the woman returns home with groceries and asks Arnold if he is a doctor; he replies, he isn't. She makes him tea as he explains his confusion at the whole situation, after which he awkwardly kisses her, excuses himself, and leaves. When he arrives home, the phone rings and he hears his wife's voice, telling him \\"You don't sound like yourself.\\" =‚ÄúThe Father‚Äù= A family stands around a baby in a basket, commenting on the child's expressions and doting on him. They talk about each of the baby's facial features in turn, trying to say who the baby looks like. \\"He doesn't look like anybody\\", a child says. Another child exclaims that the baby looks like Daddy, to which they ask \\"Who does Daddy look like?\\" and decide that he also looks like nobody. As the father turns round in the chair, his face is white and expressionless. =‚ÄúNobody Said Anything‚Äù= A boy claims he is sick, to stay home from school one day after hearing his parents arguing. The father storms out, and the mother puts on her \\"outfit\\" and goes to work, leaving the boy reading. He explores his parents' bedroom, and then walks out towards Birch Creek to fish. On the way a woman in a red car pulls over and offers him a ride. He doesn't say much, and when he gets out, fantasizes about her. At Birch Creek he catches a small fish, and moves down the river, until he sees a young boy on a bike, looking at a huge fish in the water. They try to work together to catch it, but the young boy swipes at it with a club, and the fish escapes. Further downstream, they find the fish, and the young boy chases it into the boy's grasp. They decide to cut the fish in two to have half each, but then argue about who gets which half. The young boy gets the tail. When the boy arrives home he shows his parents, but his mother is horrified, and his father tells him to put it in the garbage. The boy holds the half-fish under the porch light. =‚ÄúSixty Acres‚Äù= A Native American accosts two young kids shooting ducks on his land. He lets them go and decides to lease some of his land. =‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs in Alaska?‚Äù= Jack returns from work one day with a new pair of casual shoes, that he purchased on the way home. He shows his partner (Mary), and takes a bath, as she tells him they have been invited over to the home of their friends (Carl and Helen) that evening, to try out their new \\"water pipe\\". Mary brings Jack a beer and tells him that she's had an interview for a job in Fairbanks, Alaska. They drive to the market and buy snacks, drive home again, and walk a block, to Helen and Carl's. Together they try out the pipe, Carl laughing about the fun they had \\"breaking it in\\" the night before. Chips, dip and cream soda are brought out, while they talk about Jack and Mary's possible move to Alaska. Not knowing anything about the place, they imagine growing giant cabbages or pumpkins. Helen thinks she remembers an \\"ice man\\" discovered there. Hearing a scratch at the door, she lets the cat in. The cat catches a mouse and eats it under the coffee table. \\"Look at her eyes\\", Mary says. \\"She high, all right.\\" When they are all full, Mary and Jack say goodbye. Mary tells Jack as they are walking home that she needs to be \\"talked to, diverted tonight\\". Jack has a beer, and Mary takes a pill and goes to sleep, leaving Jack awake. In the dark hall he sees a pair of small eyes, and picks up one of his shoes to throw. Sitting up in bed, he waits for the animal to move again, or make \\"the slightest noise.\\" =‚ÄúNight School‚Äù= A man is out of work and living with his parents. He meets two women in a bar and offers them a ride in his parents' car in exchange for beer. After walking to his parents apartment, the man leaves the women outside and decides to stay in the apartment for the night. =‚ÄúCollectors‚Äù= A vacuum salesman demonstrator shows up at the house of an unemployed man and pointlessly goes through his sales patter. =‚ÄúWhat Do You Do in San Francisco?‚Äù= The postman Henry Robertson relates a story of a couple and their three children who move to his rural, working class town. He chronicles how the family are different from the work ethic-driven town members because of their arty lifestyle and the breakdown in the couple's relationship mirrors that of his own failed marriage over 20 years before. He relates how a letter ended his own and the Marston's marriage. In the story, Henry shows his distrust of and bias against Mrs. Marston even though he only sees snippets of their relationship. He blames the lack of work ethic and Mrs Marston's reluctance for her husband to get any work as responsible for what happened. His bias may be in part due to the way his wife told him it was over in a letter sent to him while he was serving overseas. \\"It was work, day and night, work that gave me oblivion when I was in your shoes and there was a war on where I was ...\\" He also sees work as a way to forget his troubles and to help forget his wife and children. =‚ÄúThe Student‚Äôs Wife‚Äù= A night of insomnia. =‚ÄúPut Yourself in my Shoes‚Äù= Coming back from an office party, a couple are interrogated and insulted in a strange meeting with their landlord and his wife. =‚ÄúJerry and Molly and Sam‚Äù= A man is driven crazy by the family dog and decides to get rid of it by dumping it on the edge of town. He soon changes his mind. = \\"Why, Honey?\\" = A mother writes a letter about her son. =‚ÄúThe Ducks‚Äù= At work the foreman suddenly dies, so everyone is sent home. At home one man fails to use the opportunity to have sex with his wife. =‚ÄúHow About This?‚Äù= A couple comes to look at the woman's father‚Äôs deserted place in the country. Maybe they will move there. =‚ÄúBicycles, Muscles, Cigarettes‚Äù= A man quits smoking. He calls round to the house of his son's friend, where a dispute is in progress over a missing bike. The man and the accused boy‚Äôs father have a fight. =‚ÄúAre These Actual Miles?‚Äù= An unemployed man‚Äôs wife goes out to sell their car and doesn‚Äôt return until dawn. =‚ÄúSignals‚Äù= A couple in a flashy restaurant seems to be trying to find out if they still have a future together. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind admitting I‚Äôm just a lowbrow.‚Äù =‚ÄúWill You Please be Quiet, Please?‚Äù= The story of Ralph and Marian, two students who marry and become teachers. Ralph becomes obsessed with the idea that Marian was unfaithful to him once in the past. Eventually, Marian admits to the infidelity, and begs him to forgive her. Ralph gets drunk and feels his whole life changing once he finds out the truth. After storming out of the house and going to skid row, he loses money at a poker game and gets mugged. Upon returning home early the next morning, he finds evidence that Marian has been wracked with guilt and has been waiting for him to return. He wonders how to proceed if he decides to leave her and locks himself in the bathroom, rebuffing a clearly repentant Marian's begging and pleas for him to let her in so that she can talk to him. Eventually he leaves the bathroom and returns to their bedroom. Marian joins him, and after a while, he turns to her and marvels at the changes within him, implying that he now understands her, himself, and marriage better, and he will give her a second chance and reconcile with her.

As of 2007, the Bonsai Village contains hundreds of thousands of bonsai trees in a site of about 330,000 square meters. The area also contains the Omiya Bonsai Art Museum, opened in 2010. The museum has indoor exhibits of bonsai history and art, as well as an outdoor area with a number of bonsai specimens. Some of the museum's materials were drawn from the Takagi Bonsai Museum of Art in Tokyo. Each year, Bonsai Village holds the \\"Great Bonsai Festival\\" from 3‚Äì5 May. During the festival the area is packed with many bonsai devotees from all over Japan.

With a capacity for 5,500 spectators, the hall also features a 25-meter swimming pool and telecommunications installations. Opened in 1993 and costing 134.6 million Norwegian krone (NOK), it was built for the 1994 Winter Olympics, where it hosted 16 ice hockey matches. It is the home of Gj√∏vik Hockey, has hosted the 1995 World Short Track Speed Skating Championships and is also used as an event venue. The structure is the world's largest cavern hall for public use. Construction Because half the country's surface consists of exposed rock, Norway has a tradition of building mountain cavern halls for many purposes, from tunnels via power plants to sport centers. These often double up as bomb shelters. Gj√∏vik Municipality opened Norway's first underground swimming pool in 1974. The idea to build an underground ice rink came from Consulting Engineer Jan A. Rygh while having dinner with Municipal Engineer Helge Simenstad in 1988, after the latter said that Gj√∏vik had been awarded an ice rink for the Olympics. The first drafts were made on a napkin in the restaurant. An alternative proposal for a conventional rink was also made. Among the advantage of a cavern hall was that it would not take up valuable downtown property space or interfere with the town's cityscape, yet it would be centrally located which would reduce travel costs, and there would be a stable year-round natural temperature which would reduce cooling costs.LOOC (III): 63 A budget was prepared by the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee (LOOC) in December 1989, and in April 1990, the Parliament of Norway passed a grant. In October, LOOC and Gj√∏vik Municipality made an agreement to share the ownership of the venue.LOOC (III): 61 The municipal council took the decision to build underground on 24 January 1991 and the main planning was contracted to Fortifikasjon. Main architects were Moe‚ÄìLevorsen. A research group was created, which had four main tasks: ventilation, energy, fire and safety; the environment; rock mechanism and geology; and laws and regulations. The group also made marketing information to promote Norwegian underground technology internationally. In preparation for construction, drilling samples were taken and sent to SINTEF and the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute for testing. The rock is 800 to 1,100 million year-old gneiss which is well suited for creating caverns. Computer models were created, and estimates were based on the Q-method. Construction started on 1 April 1991. Several points of attack were created to get the most rational work-load. The first tunnel was created below the level of the roof of the cavern. First the roof was blasted, then work started downwards. The first eight months were used for excavation, and of rock in 29,000 truckloads were removed. of dynamite were used during blasting. The mass was used to build a new marina, a lake-side promenade and a parking facility. Throughout construction, surveillance was made continually of the rock, and the crown of the roof was measured to have settled , which was as expected. Safety planning was done in cooperation with the National Office of Building Technology and Administration, and included the use of uninflammable materials, creation of sufficient fire exits. The hall cost NOK 134.6 million, of which NOK 88.5 million was grants from the government. The hall opened on 6 May 1993, with a show televised on national television and with 5,000 guests. It was the 29th indoor ice hockey rink in Norway, and the world's largest cavern hall for public use. At the time of opening, the venue was estimated to incur an operating cost of NOK 3 to 4 four million, and an operating deficit of NOK 1.7 million. To finance this, the state established a fund similar to other Olympic venues, but the fund only received NOK 1 million, and the rest of the operating costs would have to be taken by the municipality. The venue is owned through Gj√∏vik Olympiske Anlegg, originally owned 70% by Gj√∏vik Municipality and 30% by Lillehammer Olympiapark, but later taken entirely over by the municipality. Facilities The rink The facility is located just west of the town center of Gj√∏vik, with the main hall into the mountain. It is covered by of bedrock. In addition to a main hall, there is a swimming pool, a cafeteria and a telecommunications facility operated by Telenor. The main hall is designed as a multi-use venue, and can feature indoor football, handball, basketball, volleyball, rifling and tennis, as well as concerts, dining and events. The gross area of the complex is , while the net area is . The stadium covers , the public areas cover , the media center covers , the participant facilities cover , the administrative and VIP facilities cover , and the operations, management, technical, electrical and storage facilities cover . The main hall cavern has is wide, long and high. Seating capacity for the ice rink is 5,800, although it was 5,300 during the Olympics. The grandstands have a safety area under them; in case of a fire, spectators can be evacuated to these areas where they would remain until evacuation is safe. The hall duplicates as a civil defense facility, and is designed to withstand nuclear, conventional and gas attacks. The Olympic venues were designed to reflect Norwegian culture and character. The hall was designed to play on Scandinavian folklore, such as the Hall of the Mountain King in Henrik Ibsen's Peer Gynt and the caves of fairy-tale trolls. This has for instance been emulated through the use of shotcrete on the walls to give a dark and mysterious impression. Lighting is used to create high contrast, such as from the entrance which is dark with pools of light, to the main hall which is brightly lit, to emphasize its size. The dark entrance is also used to adjust the spectators' eyes so the main hall seems brighter. A contrast has also been used between the grandstands' slender lines and the coarse finish of the cavern rock. Red was chosen as the hall's main color because of natural occurrence of red in the rock. Glass tiles are used as they give associations to ice. Ventilation, energy and other installations use shine metal, representing silver embedded in the rock. The main hall is designed as an amphitheater with close contact between spectators and athletes. Events Since the opening, the venue has hosted Gj√∏vik Hockey, which started in 1993 in the Fourth Division. During the 1994 Winter Olympics, Gj√∏vik Olympic Cavern Hall hosted 16 ice hockey matches between 12 and 26 February,LOOC (IV): 127 including two quarter-finals and one semi-final. The remaining matches were played at the larger H√•kons Hall in Lillehammer.LOOC (III): 29 In March 1995, the operator announced that the ice would remain throughout the year. Because of the natural cooling of the mountain, the operator saved 1,000 kilowatts in heating costs by reusing the cooling system to heat the rest of the cavern hall. On 4 April 1995, the venue was used to host an international match between Norway and Sweden. Originally the 1995 World Short Track Speed Skating Championships was planned to take place at Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre in Hamar, the same venue which hosted short track speed skating at the 1994 Winter Olympics.LOOC (III): 57 However, because Storhamar was at scheduled time playing play-offs in the Norwegian Ice Hockey Championship, it was in December 1994 decided to move the tournament to Gj√∏vik. The championship opened on Friday 17 March with the 1500 meter races, and was followed by the 500 meter races the following day. The remaining events were held on 19 March. It is the only time the world championship has been held in Norway. There were set six world records during the championship. Chae Ji-hoon's time 4:56.29 in the men's 3000 meter and Chun Lee-kyung at 5:02.18 in the women's 3000 meter. Kim Yun-mi set the record on the women's 500 meter at 45.33 in an introductory race, while Frederic Blackburn set a world record at 2:19.71 in the semi-final of the 1500 meter. Both the relay teams also set world records: Canada with the men's record at 7:09.76 and the China with the women's at 4:26.68. The hall was one of seven venues used during the group state of the 1999 World Women's Handball Championship. Lillehammer is scheduled to host the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics and Gj√∏vik is set to host short track speed skating.

The film is a Kafkaesque nightmare in which a young computer programmer is an unwitting guinea pig in a corporate experiment to test a new advertising scheme. The film stars Jeremy Sisto and Deborah Unger and features Lance Henriksen, Eugene Byrd, Bruce Payne and Udo Kier.  Plot  A computer programmer and network engineer Simon J. (Jeremy Sisto) begins finding empty plain paper packages in his apartment. Simon goes to great length to try and secure his apartment, but the packages keep appearing. Simon attempts to find out who is leaving the packages. At the same time, Simon, who works in IT, is under pressure to complete a programming project. Simon has also become obsessed with purchasing Nature Fresh brand milk. During his investigation, Simon becomes acquainted with his eccentric neighbours in the block of apartments where he lives. The lifts within the apartment block have ceased working and the corridors are filled with security cameras. Derrick (Udo Kier), who occupies an apartment across the hall from Simon, has developed an artificial intelligence robot head, which Simon finds intriguing. Derrick suggests that the Neighbour (Bruce Payne), who occupies the apartment next to Simon's, may be responsible for the packages. Simon confronts the Neighbour, in the corridor, and asks him whether he has been leaving him packages. The Neighbour, exuding charisma and macho- ness, simply laughs at him. Simon follows the Neighbour to and from a nightclub. In the nightclub, Simon sees the Neighbour interacting with a number of women, including Trish (Deborah Kara Unger). Trish notices Simon staring at them. On the way home from the nightclub, the Neighbour soon realises that he is being followed and pulls a knife on Simon. When the Neighbour realises who Simon is, he invites him into his apartment for a drink. Before entering his apartment, the Neighbour smashes the security cameras in the corridor. When Simon enters the Neighbour's apartment, he becomes aware that his refrigerator is filled with cans of cola 500. The Neighbour invites Simon to participate in a virtual reality sex-game that he has developed and which features Trish. Simon immerses himself within the virtual reality game. When he exits the game, he finds the Neighbour bleeding and dying. The Neighbour advises him that he had also been receiving packages, before dying. Simon subsequently develops a romantic relationship with Trish. Trish is obsessed with orange juice. As Simon continues his investigations, a number of other murders begin happening in the building. Simon becomes aware that the other residents are receiving packages too but were keeping quiet. Simon also learns that the other residents are becoming addicted to certain products. The only person in the apartment who is not affected is the janitor, Howard (Lance Henriksen). One of Simon's friends, a courier named Nile (Eugene Byrd), tells Simon about a corporate experiment to ‚Äòinfuse‚Äô Nanomites into people's brains to make them addicted to certain products. Simon dismisses Nile's claims as a lie, but eventually realises that he is telling the truth.

Reception One reviewer stated that 'If Philip K. Dick was reading Kafka, got freaked out and wrote The Matrix, which was then directed by Stanley Kubrick, you might end up with something like this'. Phil Davies-Brown stated that the 'film is such an accomplished piece of work with rich texture, amazing use of location, lighting and camera and fine performances from some of the genre‚Äôs most respected talents'. Commenting on the performances of individual cast members, Davies-Brown stated that Jeremy Sisto 'was his usual weird self but it worked a treat', that 'Bruce Payne was intimidating', that Udo Kier was 'hilarious', that Deborah Kara Unger was 'mysterious' and that Lance Henriksen 'turned in his best performance in a long while'. Neil Karassik stated that the film was 'enjoyable and visually admirable'. Ryan Cracknell commented that 'while the story is very original combining the techno-edge of The Matrix with Orson Welles‚Äô The Trial, it‚Äôs the mood and atmosphere where the filmmakers really shine'. Ultimo Franco gave the film a score of 3 out of 5, commented that 'the film looks beautiful' and stated that 'fans of Guillermo del Toro and David Fincher should find a lot to appreciate here'. The film was given a score of 9 out of 10 on the website Cyberpunkreview.com, which stated that the film 'has perhaps the most biting commentary on advertising and software development you will find anywhere'. Andrea Ballerini stated that 'the movie has all the classic ingredients of the cyberpunk genre: a dystopian environment, powerful corporations trying to rule the citizens, the role of technology in the development of society, the pros and cons of progress'. Hildur Loftsd√≥ttir gave the film three stars out of five, noted the influence of David Cronenberg and David Lynch and stated that the story was 'both original and well thought out'. Rainer Heinz described the film as a 'Kafkaesk-morbid thriller with effectively interwoven set pieces from films like Blade Runner, Matrix, Cube and Delicatessen and a fascinating colour and image aesthetic'. He also stated that the film was 'a gripping and dark science fiction thriller, which achieves its effect not least from brilliant image design'. Scott Foundas was more critical of the film, stating that it 'frantically stitches together images and ideas lifted from George Orwell, The Matrix and films by David Cronenberg, only to end up with a haphazard Frankenstein monster of a movie'. Brian McKay was also critical of the film, stating that 'the plot and character development are about as thin as the atmosphere on Pluto'. Erik Childress stated that the 'film is very much like Soylent Green...as our protagonist wades through a creepy and dank futuristic setting before being hit over the head with a staggering realization' but that 'like the Charlton Heston cult classic, theres a lot of atmosphere to engulf an audience but it becomes tiresome, only to get really interesting again in the final scenes'. In 2007, the film was listed as one of the ‚ÄúTop 50 Dystopian Movies of All Time‚Äù by Snarkerati, a popular movie web- magazine.

Early life Motta was born at the city of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). Very little is known about his childhood, only that he was born into a family with Swiss-German ancestry and received a very strict education, amplified by his admission at the Military Academy of Rio de Janeiro (Col√©gio Militar do Rio de Janeiro). His father was a follower of the doctrine of Allan Kardec and his mother was Catholic. At eleven years of age he became interested for the first time in the mysterious \\"Rosicrucians\\", after reading Zanoni, the novel by Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton, and he \\"decided to search for them and to become one of those mysterious Adepts\\". But his first contact with a self-proclaimed Rosicrucian society, the Brazilian branch of AMORC, did not satisfy him and he started his search for an initiatory school of the sort he found in Krumm-Heller's novel \\"Rose-Croix.\\" His time at the Military Academy of Rio de Janeiro gave him a sense of duty and discipline, which he applied to his occult research. During that time, he became interested in astrology and tarot, among other esoteric topics. Those interests were not very common among his fellow students, but they gave him some knowledge to argue with his philosophy teacher in a debate that became famous for years. At the age of 17 he made contact with the Fraternitas Rosicruciana Antiqua, Arnold Krumm-Heller's Rosicrucian order where Motta took his first initiations in 1948, at the age of 17. Local political tension impelled him to move to Europe and then to the United States of America. His mission on this voyage, given by the Brazilian leadership of the FRA, was to meet Parsival Krumm-Heller (son of Arnold Krumm-Heller and then legal leader of FRA) and mediate the contacts between the Brazilian group and the international leadership. Thelema Motta's first contact with Thelema was through John Symonds' book The Great Beast. Motta saw many connections between the Law of Thelema and parts of his initiations at FRA, but he had never heard about Thelema or Aleister Crowley. Furthermore, the book gave him some serious doubts about Crowley's initiations. After asking P. Krumm-Heller about the subject, Motta received from him considerable material about Thelema and Crowley, readings that completely changed Motta's opinion about Crowley and his methods and philosophy. Later, in the USA, P. Krumm-Heller introduced Motta to Karl Germer, leader of Ordo Templi Orientis at that time. Returning to Brazil in 1962, Motta translated and published Crowley's Liber Aleph and wrote Calling the Children of the Sun, the first Thelemic writing published in Brazil (later this work was suppressed by Motta himself for fear of political repercussions). From this year to 1987, Motta, as a member of A‚à¥A‚à¥ had numerous students under his tutelage. Karl Germer died in 1962, and in 1969, Grady McMurtry assumed control of O.T.O. based on his letters of \\"emergency authorization\\" given to him by Crowley. In 1975, Motta published \\"The Commentaries of AL\\", as The Equinox, Volume V, Number 1. This book was published by Samuel Weiser, Inc., and contained commentaries on The Book of The Law written by Aleister Crowley and by Motta himself. He also used this book to announce his claim to be the Outer Head of the Order of O.T.O.. This claim was rejected by U.S. court in 1978, when Motta unsuccessfully sued for ownership of Crowley's copyrights. The case was finally rejected on appeal in 1985. Later years Motta admired and practiced oriental martial arts, specially Judo and Tae Kwon Do. In 1973 Motta self-produced a movie called \\"O Judoka\\" (\\"The Judo Fighter\\"). Apparently the movie did not pay for itself, forcing him to pay for its debts in the few following years. In 1975, Motta wrote lyrics for some of the songs of The Novo Aeon (New Aeon) Album which was released by musician Raul Seixas in the same Year. Motta never had any kind of economic stability, jumping from job to job and making a living as an English teacher, aided by the help of his followers. He died on August 26, 1987, at the city of Teres√≥polis (Brazil) at the age of 56 of myocardial infarction (a heart attack.) Motta established his version of O.T.O. called Society Ordo Templi Orientis in Brazil and elsewhere. The order never reveals the number of its members but it does seem to be smaller than the legally recognized Ordo Templi Orientis. The legally recognized O.T.O. is now headed by a student of Motta's named William Breeze. Motta's pupils included the Brazilian celebrity novelist Paulo Coelho, mathematician and philosopher Gary Costner (Frater P.L.S.), and musician Raul Seixas. He originally bequeathed his succession to the care of three pupils (William Robert Barden, Claudia Canuto de Menezes, and Daniel Ben Stone) on condition that they agree. (Deed and Trust, dated October 15, 1984). They failed to do so. Barden did succeed in publishing some authorized editions of Motta's work .

Geology  Its geology comprises tertiary formation of mudstone, shale and argillite with subordinate beds of quartzite, sandstone, siltstone and limestone breccias. The range physical characteristics strongly dissected into steep sided valleys and narrow-crested ridges where it is separated from Crocker by the Tambunan-Keningau-Tenom plain. It serves as a vital water catchment area for numerous water bodies such as the Kinabatangan, Labuk, Liwagu and Pegalan rivers. The largest catchment area is the headwaters of the Pegalan River with a number of tributaries including the Ambual, Kaingaran, Keinop, Linsudon, Mailo, Monsok, Sembuan, Sungei and Sook flow to the western direction into the South China Sea while the smallest catchment is irrigated by several tributaries of Liwagu River that flow into eastern direction towards the Sulu Sea.

Toph has been blind since birth, but due to her extensive earthbending skills, she can locate objects and their movements by sensing their vibrations in the earth around her. She is introduced in the second season of Avatar, and travels with the protagonist Aang as his earthbending teacher. Character overview =Creation and conception= Toph was initially conceived as a sixteen-year-old boy that was athletic and muscular, designed to be a foil to Sokka.Avatar Extras for episode \\"The Blind Bandit\\". As the series progressed and the time came closer to the introduction of an earthbender that would join the main characters, head writer Aaron Ehasz introduced the idea of a little girl being able to defeat strong and muscular adult earthbenders, which though found humorous by some of the staff, was initially rejected by Avatar co-creator Bryan Konietzko. Following several long discussions, Konietzko stopped fighting the idea and warmed up to it, after which Toph was made female and introduced into the series, becoming one of Konietzko's favorite characters. The character's original design was recycled into the appearances of minor characters The Boulder and Sud. Her original design greatly influenced the appearance of Bolin in The Legend of Korra. Her Earth Rumble outfit, the clothing she wears for the majority of Avatar: The Last Airbender, was inspired by European fashion styles.DVD commentary for \\"The Blind Bandit\\" Her fancy dress was modeled after the traditional clothing of the Chinese Tang dynasty. Toph uses a unique fighting style of earthbending, based on the Southern Praying Mantis style. Toph was favored by the creators to return in The Legend of Korra after the appearances of both Katara and Zuko, DiMartino writing that it \\"never quite made sense\\" for there to be a trip to the swamp, where she was located, during the third season. In the following season, she was meant to serve as a foil to Korra with her \\"gruff mentoring style\\" contrasting the reserved Korra. Her design became a subject of difficulty for the staff, who wanted her to return to the size of her twelve-year-old self from the original series despite flashbacks in the earlier part of The Legend of Korra showing her as having grown in height. Konietzko was content with the staff's wishes but wanted her shortened height to come from her having become hunched since then. Artists had issues carrying out this design, resulting in multiple takes. =Personality and characteristics= Toph is fiercely independent, direct, belligerent, and practiced in taunting and insulting her opponents and on occasion her friends, particularly Sokka. On several occasions Toph appears picking her nose, spitting, and belching loudly. As she explained to Aang and his companions, she does this intentionally as a rebellion against the principles of refined culture that her aristocratic parents attempted to make her conform to. If the situation absolutely requires it, she actually knows how to behave in upper- class Earth Kingdom culture much better than Aang's companions do. She is usually covered in dirt, or as she calls it, \\"a healthy coating of earth\\". Despite retaining much of her strength as an earthbender even in her advanced age, Toph refuses to take part in prolonged conflicts, admitting that she is too old and lacks the energy for such endeavors. She was, however, roused into action against Kuvira, the main antagonist of Book Four: Balance, when she posed a direct threat to her family. =Name= In \\"The Serpent's Pass\\", Toph's passport reads (t«î gu√≥ t√≥u dƒõng h√π zh√†o bƒõi fƒÅng tu√≤ f√∫), which translates as \\"Earth Kingdom First Class Passport: Beifong Toph\\". Here, her name means \\"supported lotus\\", which matches her parents' view of their daughter as a flower in need of protection. In \\"Tales of Ba Sing Se\\", her name is written as (Tu≈ç F≈´), which is the phonetic transcription based on the official guide for foreign names. In \\"The Earth King\\", her name is reverted to . Her last name Beifong () is close to the Mandarin pronunciation of the word \\"North\\" (bƒõi fƒÅng). The word (Tu≈ç) also means \\"to support in one's palm\\", or \\"drag\\" and is the word used for child care. Appearances =Avatar: The Last Airbender= Jessie Flower voices the young Toph in Avatar: The Last Airbender. Book Two: Earth Toph's parents view her blindness as a disability and therefore kept her concealed. Despite her handicap, Toph developed special skills by keeping company with the blind 'Badgermoles' that inhabited nearby caves. By imitating their movements, Toph became a master of the martial art known as 'earthbending', but she kept her ability secret from her family. Toph fought frequently in Earth Rumble, an earthbending lei tai tournament resembling professional wrestling, under the alias \\"Blind Bandit\\". By the time Aang and his friends discover Toph at the tournament, she had become champion, holding a 42‚Äì0 win-loss record. When her parents learn about this and confine her further, Toph runs away to accompany Aang and his friends as Aang's earthbending instructor. Toph nearly leaves the group after feuding with Katara over not contributing to the group's teamwork, though rejoins them following a meeting with Iroh and encountering Princess Azula for the first time. Toph successfully begins Aang's training of earthbending and slows the descent of Wan Shi Tong's Library, where the group learns the date of the next Day of Black Sun and inadvertently gains an advantage over the Fire Nation, as it sinks, though fails to prevent Appa from being kidnapped by sandbenders. Due to Appa being the group's transportation, they are forced to travel on foot, journeying through Serpent's Pass and preventing a drill from entering Ba Sing Se. Now in the city, she infiltrates the Earth Kingdom Royal Palace, meeting Dai Li,Hedrick, Tim (writer) & MacMullan, Lauren (director). (September 22, 2006). \\"City of Walls and Secrets\\".

She quickly escapes and traps her captors in the same small cage. Book Four: Promise In The Promise trilogy, Toph is revealed to have established the Beifong Metalbending Academy, an instructional institution to help earthbenders learn metalbending, shortly after the end of the television series. She chooses her three students (Penga, The Dark One, and Ho Tun) on the basis of her meteorite bracelet shivering in their presence.Avatar: The Last Airbender ‚Äì The Promise, Part 1 Though claiming her motives behind founding the school were due to her love of metalbending, in actuality she enjoys bossing people around.

Toph prevents others from being killed by debris falling from the mine collapsing,Avatar: The Last Airbender ‚Äì The Rift, Part 2 including her father, who reconciles with her as she saves everyone. Following this, she passes out and has her students assist Aang in his battle against the spirit of Old Iron.Avatar: The Last Airbender ‚Äì The Rift, Part 3 =The Legend of Korra= Korra encounters 86-year-old Toph living in the swamp. Book One: Air In The Legend of Korra, Toph is revealed to have founded Republic City's police force and taught the art of metalbending to her students. Two of her students were her daughters Lin and Suyin. Her daughters mention in passing to Korra that they are actually half-sisters by two different fathers, but their identities were not revealed, and due to as-yet- unexplained reasons neither of Toph's daughters ever knew their fathers. Due to her own strict upbringing, Toph raised the pair as a single parent with essentially no restrictions. But it caused both of them to feel that she was ignoring them as their mutual need for her attention caused them to react in different ways: the older and strict Lin following in her mother's footsteps as a Republic City police officer while the free-spirited Suyin rebelled against Toph by hanging with the wrong crowd. Eventually, Lin caught Suyin driving the getaway car for her criminal friends after a jewel theft, during which Suyin accidentally scarred the right side of Lin's face. Toph was forced to look the other way and tear up the police report because of controversy it would cause before sending Suyin away to live with her grandparents. Toph, feeling guilt over her questionable actions, retired the following year with Lin eventually succeeding her as Republic City's Chief of Police by the time of the first season. Book Three: Change In the third-season episodes, \\"The Metal Clan\\" and \\"Old Wounds\\", it is revealed that Toph made her peace with a repentant Suyin and spent some years living with Suyin's family in Zaofu, a city of creative metalbenders founded by Suyin, which recognized Toph as the inventor of metalbending. Some years prior to the events of the series, Toph left Zaofu to travel the world in search of enlightenment and had not been seen or heard from since. Book Four: Balance Toph appears in the fourth-season episode \\"Korra Alone\\", having made a home in the sacred spirit wilds of the Foggy Swamp where Aang's reincarnation, Korra, encounters her. In the episodes \\"The Coronation\\" and \\"The Calling\\", she assists Korra by removing the remnant liquid-metal poison placed in her body by the Red Lotus through helping her overcome her fears brought about by her past adversaries. Toph returns in the tenth episode, \\"Operation: Beifong\\", to aid Lin, her granddaughter Opal, and Bolin, in freeing Suyin and her family from Kuvira's Earth Empire forces. She reveals that Lin's father was named Kanto, a nice man whose relationship with Toph didn't work out. Graphic novel trilogies Abilities =Heightened senses= An illustration of Toph's mechanoreceptor ability to feel minute seismic vibrations through the ground, similar to sonar. Being blind, Toph's mechanoreceptors and other senses are hyper-sensitive. By grounding herself barefoot, Toph can \\"see\\" and \\"feel\\" even the most minute seismic vibrations in the earth, be it the presence of trees or the march of ants several meters away, an earthbending technique dubbed the \\"seismic sense\\". Toph has acquired an acute sense of hearing, enabling her to recognize people by their voices, discern a person's physical appearance by sound, overhear distant conversations, and sense falsehood via the individual's subtle breathing patterns, heartbeat, and physical reactions. After taking residence in the Foggy Swamp, Toph claimed her heightened senses has expanded to point of being fine-tuned via the spirit vines with events around the world. Toph is disadvantaged against opponents who require minimal contact with the ground and vulnerable to any attacks initiated in mid-air. Terrain that impairs Toph's ability to sense vibrations also hinders her abilities; she has some difficulty with sand, which constantly lacks solidity, preventing her from accurately \\"feeling\\" her surroundings. Because Toph relies on sensation in her feet to perform earthbending, she becomes truly \\"blind\\" if the soles of her feet are damaged, as shown when Zuko accidentally burns her feet. Although, she can feel the vibrations of the earth with her hands to some degree, just not nearly as well as with her feet. Her affinity with the earth is further illustrated in that Toph does not know how to swim and expresses an aversion to flying. =Earthbending= Toph is highly skilled in earthbending which utilizes chinese martial arts techniques of H√≥ng Qu√°n and Chu Gar N√°n P√†i T√°ngl√°ng.The Lost Scrolls: Fire, page 159 of The Lost Scrolls Collection.

(June 2, 2006). \\"Bitter Work\\". Avatar: The Last Airbender. Season 2. Episode 9. Nickelodeon. It is categorized as the most diverse and enduring of the \\"four bending arts\\". Earthbending is the geokinetic ability to manipulate earth, rock, sand, lava, and metals in all their various forms. Earthbending utilizes neutral jing, which involves waiting and listening for the right moment to act decisively. Earthbending involves enduring attacks until the right opportunity to counterattack reveals itself, emphasizes \\"heavily rooted stances and strong blows that evoke the mass and power of earth\\", and demands precise stepping footwork to maintain constant contact with the ground. Earthbending parallels Five Animals movements (such as the tiger's hard blows and the crane's affinity to landing gracefully). Earthbending is at its strongest when the feet or hand are in direct contact with the ground, enabling earthbenders to transfer their kinetic energies into their bending for fast and powerful moves. This reliance on direct contact with the earth is a figurative Achilles' heel; separating earthbenders from any contact with the earth renders them ineffective. Neutral Jing The series' creators consulted a professional martial artist in the design of the show's fighting style. The primary concepts in Earthbending (i.e. listening, reacting, balancing attacks and defense) and drawing power from a stable lower body are referred to in the practice of neutral jing. The concept of neutral jing relates to the philosophy of \\"sticky hands\\". The purpose of sticky hands is to enable the practitioner to predict their opponent's next move. Similar to Toph detecting the movements of others through her connection with earth, a practitioner learns to detect their opponent's upcoming move by maintaining constant contact between their own arms, hands or wrists, and their foe's arm. By practicing with a partner in this manner, a practitioner learns to \\"read\\" the slight movements of their opponent's arms to detect their next attack and subsequently move accordingly to neutralize it. Metalbending Throughout Avatar: The Last Airbender, Toph is the first earthbender known to bend metal. When Toph is imprisoned in iron, the sadhu Guru Pathik explains to Aang in a parallel scene that metal is refined earth; whereupon Toph locates the iron's impurities and manipulates them to \\"bend\\" the metal portion. She practices and hones her initially unique skill throughout the rest of the series, later teaching it to other earthbenders prior to the events of the Legend of Korra.  Reception  Reviewer Michael Mammano loved that while Toph \\"never loses her rough edge, she's always been deftly humanized\\", feeling her relationships with her daughters would matter to her and thought it was \\"incredibly refreshing and feminist\\" that she had two children with different men because nowhere in the narrative was Toph \\"questioned or shamed for having children out of wedlock\\", adding: \\"She has been canonically confirmed as a woman who had a sex life that was on her terms.\\" Mammano braced for her to die in The Legend of Korra episode \\"Operation: Beifong\\", though she survived and felt that as her final appearance in the series, \\"it was a great send-off, especially given her parting words.\\" Toph's character was viewed as being \\"ruined\\" due to her poor parenting in the eyes of her daughter Lin in The Legend of Korra. (Aang received similar criticisms from his children Bumi and Kya.) Mammano objected to this by reasoning that the story is told from the perspective of her children while she was no longer around to defend herself, with and that grown children would never be able to fully understand their parents' rationale for raising them the way they did.

SDSD was founded in 1880 as the Dakota Territorial School for Deaf Mutes when the area was still part of the Dakota Territory.Gannon, Jack. 1981. Deaf Heritage‚ÄìA Narrative History of Deaf America, Silver Spring, MD: National Association of the Deaf, p. 47 (PDF ) When South Dakota became a state in 1889, the school was placed under the state's Board of Charities and Corrections and the name changed to its present form. In 1944, voters ratified an amendment to the state constitution which moved SDSD and the South Dakota School for the Blind (now the South Dakota School for the Blind and Visually Impaired) under the care of the South Dakota Board of Regents. The student population reached a peak of 100-150 students by the 1960s; advances in hearing aid technology made it possible for hard of hearing students to stay in regular classes and various disability-related laws passed between the 1970s and 1990s led to increased placement of deaf students in public school environments rather than sending them to SDSD. The result was a gradual decline to about 50 students by the mid-1990s. This combined with the prevailing attitude of the Regents towards deafness led to the establishment of the current auditory / oral (cochlear implant) program and later, the transfer of both this and the original sign language-based program to neighboring school districts and closure of the main campus in 2011.

The clan, originally known as the Kakizaki clan (Ë†£Â¥éÊ∞è), had settled in Kakizaki, Kawauchi, Mutsu on the Shimokita Peninsula. Claiming descent from the Takeda clan of Wakasa Province, the family later took the name Matsumae. In exchange for their service in defending the country, the Matsumae were made exempt from owing rice to the shogunate in tribute, and from the sankin-k≈çtai system, under which most daimy≈çs (feudal lords of Edo period Japan) were required to spend half the year at Edo, while their families spent the entire year at Edo and were, essentially, held hostage to prevent rebellion. Relations with Russia and the Ainu Due to their location, and their role as border defenders, the Matsumae were the first Japanese to negotiate with Russia in any way. They may well have been the first Japanese to meet Russians at all within Japanese territory. In 1778, a merchant from Yakutsk by the name of Pavel Lebedev-Lastochkin arrived in Hokkaid≈ç with a small expedition. He offered gifts and politely asked to trade. The Matsumae official tried to explain that he had no authority to agree to trade on behalf of the sh≈çgun and suggested that the Russians come back the following year. The following September, the Russians did just that. According to some accounts, they had misinterpreted what had been said and expected to trade. Instead their gifts were returned to them, they were forbidden to return to the island, and they were advised that foreign trade was allowed only at Nagasaki, a port on the southernmost of Japan's home islands. In 1790, a massive earthquake struck Hokkaid≈ç, and a forty-two-foot tsunami lifted the Russian ship out of the sea, depositing it a quarter-mile inland. The merchant Lebedev then gave up on Hokkaid≈ç. Palace reception near Hakodate in 1751. Ainu bringing gifts. The Matsumae clan's fief had extensive contacts with the Ainu of Hokkaid≈ç, and had exclusive rights to trade with the Ainu communities of the island and to guarantee the security of Japanese interests there. Relations between the Matsumae and the Ainu was sometimes hostile, demonstrating that their power was not absolute in the region. In 1669, what started as a fight for resources between rival Ainu clans developed into a rebellion against Matsumae control of the region. It lasted until 1672, when Shakushain's Revolt was finally put down. The last serious Ainu rebellion was the Menashi-Kunashir Rebellion in 1789. In 1790, Kakizaki Haky≈ç painted the Ish≈´ Retsuz≈ç, a series of portraits of Ainu chiefs, in order to prove to the Japanese populace that the Matsumae were capable of controlling the northern borders and the Ainu. The 12 paintings of Ainu chiefs were displayed in 1791 in Kyoto. At roughly the same time, in 1789, a Finnish professor, Erik Laxmann, of the Russian Academy of Sciences, came across several Japanese castaways in Irkutsk. Like several other Japanese before them, they had been found in the Aleutians, off the coast of Alaska, by Russian sailors and had asked to be brought back to Japan. Like those before them, these castaways had been transported instead across Siberia on their way to St. Petersburg. Laxman saw their plight as an opportunity to work towards the opening of Japan, and suggested this to Catherine the Great, who agreed. In 1791, she appointed the professor's son, Lt. Adam Laxman, to command a voyage to return these castaways to Japan, and to open discussions towards a trade agreement. The expedition reached Hokkaid≈ç in October 1792, and found the Japanese surprisingly hospitable. The Russians were allowed to spend the winter, and documents about them were sent to the bakufu in Edo. However, Professor Laxman insisted on bringing the castaways to Edo, and said that he would sail there himself even against the Sh≈çgun's wishes. The bakufu sent an envoy to the Matsumae, requesting that the Russians make their way to the town of Matsumae by land. Sensing a trap, the Russians refused, and they were eventually allowed to make port in Hakodate, escorted by a Japanese vessel. They were given a guest house near Matsumae Castle, and were, unusually, allowed to maintain their own customs: they did not deny their Christianity, remove their boots indoors or bow to the Sh≈çgun's envoys. The Japanese envoys gave them three swords and a hundred bags of rice, but also informed them that the Sh≈çgun's rules remained unchangeable: foreigners could trade only at Nagasaki, and only if they came unarmed. All other ships would be subject to seizure. Due to his purposes in returning castaways, Laxman was granted a pardon in this instance, but he refused to relinquish the castaways until he was given something in writing answering his request for trade. The envoys returned three days later with a document restating the rules regarding trade at Nagasaki and the laws against the practice of Christianity in Tokugawa Japan. The Russians never did establish any regular system of trade at Nagasaki, and historians today still disagree as to whether the document given to Professor Laxman was an invitation to trade, or an evasive maneuver on the part of the shogunate. The Russian expedition led by Adam Johann von Krusenstern and Nikolai Rezanov stayed for six months in the port of Nagasaki in 1804‚Äì1805, failing to establish diplomatic and trade relations with Japan. mon on the clothing of the standing figure in background looks like four diamond-shapes turned sideways.

It was the first sorority founded by African-American college women. Lyle is often referred to as the \\"Guiding Light\\" for Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated. Lyle had a forty-year career as an educator and was active in public life. She was National Treasurer of the sorority for more than twenty years. Ethel Hedgeman Lyle chartered (established) and was the first president of Omega Omega, its first alumnae chapter in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Lyle also founded the West Philadelphia chapter of the League of Women Voters and the Mothers Club in the city. In 2000, the Ethel Hedgeman Lyle Academy, a charter school in St. Louis, Missouri, was founded in her honor. All these activities helped create social capital in the city in a time of rapid growth and population changes. Lyle demonstrated in her committed life how African-American sororities supported women \\"to create spheres of influence, authority and power within institutions that traditionally have allowed African Americans and women little formal authority and real power.\\"Tamara L. Brown, Gregory Parks, Clarenda M. Phillips, African American Fraternities and Sororities: The Legacy and the Vision. Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 2005. p. 342. Early life Ethel Hedgeman was born in 1887 in Periodtt St. Louis, Missouri. Throughout her elementary and high school career, Hedgeman attended public schools in St. Louis. In 1904, Hedgeman graduated from Sumner High School with honors. She gained a scholarship to Howard University, considered the top among historically black colleges. Hedgeman demonstrated her ambition and abilities by the scholarship to Howard at a time when only one in three hundred African Americans and 5% of whites of eligible age attended any college.James D. Anderson, The Education of Blacks in the South, 1860‚Äì1935. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina, 1988, p. 245. In 1904, Hedgeman entered Howard University. However, due to illness in her sophomore year, Hedgeman had to take a break from her studies. Throughout college, she belonged to Howard's choir, YWCA, and the Christian Endeavor, as well as participating in drama plays. She was described as lively and charming, despite her delicate health.\\"A Visionary Woman\\": Ethel Hedgeman Lyle Accessed November 18, 2007. Career = Alpha Kappa Alpha = Throughout the fall of 1907, Hedgeman was instrumental in founding Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Incorporated, America's first Greek-letter organization established by Black college women. Hedgeman was inspired by the accounts of Tremaine Robinson, a faculty member at Howard who shared her sorority experiences at Brown University.Lawrence C. Ross, Jr., The Divine Nine: The History of African-American Fraternities and Sororities.New York: Kensington Publishing Corporation, 2001, p. 166. Hedgeman was also aided in her efforts by her friend George Lyle, whom she had dated since high school. He was a charter member the Beta chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity at Howard in 1907. To establish a sorority, Hedgeman began recruiting interested classmates during the summer of 1907.McNealey 2006, op. cit., p. 19. Together, the nine classmates founded Alpha Kappa Alpha on January 15, 1908.McNealey 2006, op. cit., p. 37. Hedgeman served as vice- president of the sorority, since she was a junior, and designed the insignia for the sorority.McNealey 2006, op. cit., p. 21. Starting in the 1920s, as national treasurer of Alpha Kappa Alpha for more than 20 years, Lyle (by then married) continued to guide the sorority and its growth. = Education = After graduating in 1909 with a Bachelor of Arts in liberal arts, Hedgeman moved to Eufaula, Oklahoma for her first job as a teacher. She taught music in Sumner Normal School between 1909 and 1910. She was the first African-American female college graduate to teach in a normal school in Oklahoma and the first to earn a Teacher's Life Certificate from the Oklahoma State Department of Education. In 1910, Hedgeman moved to Centralia, Illinois, where she also taught in public schools. On June 21, 1911, Ethel Hedgeman married George Lyle, whom she had dated in high school and college. They moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where Ethel gave birth to George, III, her only child. George Lyle also worked as a teacher, considered by both to be a critical profession for the future of African Americans. Ethel continued her education career in Philadelphia by teaching English at the Thomas Purham School and Chester A. Arthur School. She retired in 1948, after almost forty years of teaching generations of students. In addition to her work as an educator, Lyle was active in public life. She helped found civic institutions such as the West Philadelphia League of Women Voters and the Mother's Club of the city. In addition Lyle was a member of the Republican Women's Committee of Ward 40 and active in her church. As national treasurer of Alpha Kappa Alpha from 1923 to 1946, Lyle helped lead the sorority through years of rapid social change, including the Great Migration of more than a million African Americans from the South to the North, the Depression and challenges of World War II. In Philadelphia, in 1926 she chartered and was the first president of Omega Omega, the first alumnae chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha in Philadelphia. (Eighty years old and with 400 members in the 21st century, the Omega Omega chapter continues to provide services to women and children in the city.)Omega Omega Chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha accessed 8 December 2007 Lyle's leadership skills were called on in 1937, when the Mayor of Philadelphia appointed her to chair the Committee of 100 Women, organized to plan the Sesquicentennial Anniversary of the Adoption of the U.S. Constitution.

Honors Lyle received many accolades for her achievements. In honor of her role as founder of AKA, in 1926 Alpha Kappa Alpha designated her Honorary Basileus, the only member with that title. In 1951, the sorority established the Ethel Hedgeman Lyle Endowment Fund. In 1994 Lyle's granddaughters, Andrea and Muriel, were inducted as honorary members of Alpha Kappa Alpha. In 2018, Lyle‚Äôs great-great granddaughter, Chant√©l Harris, was inducted as an honorary member of Alpha Kappa Alpha. In Lyle's birthplace of St. Louis, members of Omicron Theta Omega chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha, set up a charter school, named Ethel Hedgeman Lyle Academy in her honor.

Though the wording of the bill was generally considered unclear, the general consensus among observers was that its effect would be to eliminate public dissemination of National Weather Service data and forecasts except in case of severe weather alerts. The bill attracted no cosponsors in the Senate and eventually died in committee, and was roundly criticized by the general public for threatening to move taxpayer-funded data (currently made available for free) to commercial for-profit channels (i.e. behind a pay wall). The bill had very few supporters outside the commercial weather industry.Weather info could go dark In the wake of the bill's introduction, Santorum was accused of political impropriety and influence peddling because Joel Myers, the head of Pennsylvania-based AccuWeather and one of Santorum's constituents, was also a Santorum campaign contributor. Myers and his brother, the executive vice president, donated over $11,000 to Santorum's political campaigns, including $2,000 two days before Santorum introduced the bill. In September 2005, while the bill was still in committee, Santorum criticized the National Weather Service's forecasting of Hurricane Katrina, claiming that more lives could have been saved if the NWS's operation focused on severe weather.

Sailors of the Austro- Hungarian Navy in the Adriatic Bay of Cattaro (today: Kotor, Montenegro), which at that time belonged to Austria-Hungary started it on 1 February 1918. The mutiny remained isolated and had to be abandoned after three days due to the arrival of loyal troops. Four sailors were subsequently executed according to martial law. The naval historian Halpern portrays this event as the last victory of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy over the social forces that would eventually overwhlem it.Paul, G. Halpern: The Cattaro Mutiny, 1918. In: Christopher, M. Bell/Bruce A. Elleman (Ed.): Naval mutinies of the twentieth century. An international perspective. London 2003, pp. 54‚Äì79, here p. 54. Available at: , free registration required. Historical background At the beginning of 1918, dissatisfaction with the food situation, with the political conditions, as well as war fatigue had increased further. After the Russian October Revolution of 1917 and the peace offer of the Bolsheviks, wide circles, especially of the working class, feared that the German Supreme Army Command could jeopardise the hoped-for peace on the Eastern Front by making excessive demands. In protest, the J√§nnerstreik occurred with over 700,000 participants throughout Austria-Hungary. Workers' councils were formed, which also demanded better supplies, the abolition of censorship, the end of martial law and the introduction of the eight-hour day. The strike wave also reached the naval arsenal in Pola. After the strikes in the Monarchy ended for the most part on 21 January, work was also resumed in Pola on 28 January.Peter Fitl: Meuterei und Standgericht. Die Matrosenrevolte im Kriegshafen Cattaro vom Februar 1918 und ihr kriegsgerichtliches Nachspiel. Wien 2018, S. 76 ff. Presumably unaware of the end of the actions, the sailors of the warships anchored in Cattaro decided to hold a demonstration, which they hoped would give the movement further impetus.Richard Georg Plaschka: Cattaro ‚Äì Prag. Revolte und Revolution. Kriegsmarine und Heer √ñsterreich-Ungarns im Feuer der Aufstandsbewegungen vom 1. Februar und 28. Oktober 1918. Graz 1963, S. 15‚Äì19. The base of Cattaro in the south of Austria-Hungary became of special strategic importance when the Lovƒáen, located on Montenegrin territory and overlooking the bay, was conquered in 1916 during the occupation of Montenegro and Northern Albania. Cattaro now became an important base of operations against the Otranto barrier, a base for the submarine warfare in the Mediterranean, and for supplies to the Balkan front. For this purpose, besides destroyers, torpedo boats and submarines (also German ones), the whole Cruiser Flotilla under the flagship (Austrian: Flaggenschiff) \\"SMS Sankt Georg\\" as well as the V. Ship Division was deployed there.Richard G. Plaschka/Horst Haselsteiner/Arnold Suppan: Innere Front. Milit√§rassistenz, Widerstand und Umsturz in der Donaumonarchie 1918. vol. 1: Zwischen Streik und Meuterei. Vienna 1974, S. 108. Warships and their positions in Cattaro Bay in February 1918 Destroyers, torpedo boats and submarines as well as the modern Rapidkreuzer (fast cruisers) carried the main load of the naval warfare, while the large ships were mostly idly at anchor, because - as in the German Empire - the risk of the fleet getting destroyed seemed too great (fleet in being). This was also an important reason for increasing tensions between officers and crews aboard these units.Plaschka/Haselsteiner/Suppan, Innere Front, p. 109.Halpern, Cattaro, p. 73 f. The crews felt unjustly and roughly treated by their superiors. They complained about senseless drill, about strict punishment for nullity, about insults, humiliations by often young officers, about the poor rations in contrast to the officers, about torn off uniforms, about the little home leave. Many crew members were trained metalworkers and had come into contact with the ideas of the social democratic workers movement. They demanded democratic reforms. The perceived privileged position of the officers also fed the suspicion that they were not interested in peace, but wanted to prolong the war, while the ordinary soldiers and their families had to suffer great privations.Plaschka, Cattaro ‚Äì Prag, p. 29 ff.Bruno Frei: Die Matrosen von Cattaro.

Course of events =The first day of the uprising, 1 February 1918= The uprising, which apparently had been prepared by various loose groups,Jind≈ôich Vesel√Ω mentions in his book Povst√°n√≠ v Boce Kotorsk√© (see under Literature) on p. 34 - unfortunately without any evidence (one can only assume that he based his statement on interviews with contemporary witnesses mentioned in the appendix) - the following persons who would have organised the action: \\"Nobody asked, but everyone suspected that the warm-blooded Croatian sailors Matuloviƒç, Uidor, Marusiƒç, Su≈æek, Grabar and Berniƒçeviƒç, as well as the well-known impetuous Italians Baldini, Pachor, Galigari and Scaramuza were very close to the organisers of the rebellion. There was no doubt that they included a number of Czechs: the serious and brilliant Franti≈°ek Rasch, the conscious social democrats, the Prague Rudolf Kreibich and Tomas Nitka of \\"St. Georg\\", Petr P√°ral, Viennese Czech from \\"G√§a\\", Zah√°lka from \\"Monarch\\", Franta Srbek from \\"Franz Joseph\\", Josef Dƒõd from \\"Karl VI,\\", ≈†mahel from \\"G√§a\\", Bittner from \\"Novara\\", Janousek from \\"Helgoland\\", Vo≈°mik from \\"Balaton\\" and M√Ωvalt from \\"Orjen\\" as well as Pribyl and Fr.

There were also the Polish Gustav Stonawski, a socialist who had organised a hunger strike at the Naval School in Pola as early as 1912 and the airman Grabowiecki.\\" Frei mentions similar names, unfortunately without citing a verifiable source (report by sailor Ujdor) (Frei, Cattaro, p. 42). Plaschka and colleagues, referring to Stulli, describe these statements as problematic. (Plaschka/Haselsteiner/Suppan, Innere Front, p. 117). started from the flagship \\"SMS Sankt Georg\\" on 1 February 1918 at about 12 noon. SMS Sankt Georg The officers had lunch in their mess. The crew armed themselves, fired a cannon shot and raised a red flag. The chief officer (Austrian: Gesamt Detail Offizier) Zipperer,Egon Zipperer von Arbach held the rank of Korvettenkapit√§n (lieutenant commander). Sondhaus describes Zipperer wrongly as ‚ÄúCaptain‚Äù (see under Literature, p. 199) probably giving rise to the claim in some wikipedia articles that Zipperer was the commander of ‚ÄúSt. Georg‚Äù. The commanding officer was Fregattenkapit√§n (commander) Huber Edler von Scheibenhain. See Plaschka/Haselsteiner/Suppan, Innere Front, p. 114 ff. who rushed on deck, received a shot to the temporal bone. Medical assistance was initially prevented before he could be taken to the ship's hospital. In addition, a non-commissioned officer was shot through the chest and a sailor was injured by a ricocheting bullet. There were also shots fired at the ship's commander, but without hitting him. At the request of the crew, the ship's commander brought Rear Admiral Hansa, the commander of the Cruiser Flotilla, on deck. Anton Grabar demanded the immediate end of the war according to the Fourteen Points of Woodrow Wilson and he complained about the bad treatment especially by the young cadets and the insufficient rations. The officers were now ordered to eat the same food as the crew. Plaschka, Cattaro-Prag, p. 41. Another centre of action was aboard SMS G√§a. G√§a was a depot and workshop ship with a large number of older workers on board, who had come into contact with social democratic ideas more intensively. SMS G√§a with torpedoboats and submarines in the middle bay of Cattaro, off Gjenoviƒá (ƒêenoviƒái). The movement spread quickly. The red flag was hoisted on all larger ships. Only on the ships that were more frequently sent out for warfare, on which therefore the crews were treated much better by the officers, it encountered discomfort (on the fast cruisers) or resistance (on the destroyers, torpedoboats and submarines). Under the threat from the battlecruisers that the ships would be taken under fire, some of the smaller units, partly with the agreement of their commanders, hoisted the red flag.Plaschka/Haselsteiner/Suppan, Innere Front, p. 117 ff. The destroyer Csepel had earlier received a sailing order for 15 o'clock, to escort a convoy to Durazzo. The commander had the boilers fired up. Thereupon G√§a signalled that in case of leaving the bay fire would be opened. The commander of the Csepel, however, ordered the ship to be cast off and threatened to torpedo the Sankt Georg. The Sankt Georg and the G√§a then fired one cannon shot each. When the Csepel drew nevertheless nearer, the chief of staff on Sankt Georg ordered the Csepel back to the berth.Fitl, Cattaro, p. 94.Halpern, Cattaro, p. 61. Altogether about 30 warships and about 3,000‚Äì4,000 men, out of a total of 5,000 naval personnel in Cattaro, took part in the uprising. Also the submarine base, the telegraph magazine, the naval mine command and the naval air station in Kumbor as well as the back-up battery in Gjenoviƒá (today: ƒêenoviƒái) and the naval station Caballa were involved.Fitl, Cattaro, p. 268, 270-273. In place of the officers, sailors‚Äô councils or crew committees, usually designated by acclamation, took over, and continued to organise the service in the normal way. A central committee was formed on SMS Sankt Georg. In the evening the committee handed over a note with the demands of the crews to the cruiser flotilla commander Rear Admiral Alexander Hansa, which contained both general political and crew-specific points: \\"What we want # Measures to initiate an immediate general peace. # Complete political independence from other powers. # Peace based on the Russian democratic proposal, 'without annexation etc.' # Complete disarmament (demobilisation) and establishment of the voluntary militia. # Right of self- determination of the peoples. # An answer in good faith to Wilson's note. # Greater support and adequate food and clothing for the relatives of the conscripted. # Democratisation of the government. ::----------------------------- # Due to malnutrition, omitting all unnecessary work and drill. For KorveesThis term described work on shore by crews. These were particularly unpopular because they did not fall within the actual scope of duties, were associated with great physical effort and were sometimes connected with improvements in the lives of superiors; e.g. sports facilities set up for officers. separate food allowance. # More shore leave and of longer duration. # Home leave strictly within 6 months once in the duration of 21 days without travel days. Same conditions for staff. # Introduction of a humane, faster transport for those on leave, increase of the boarding allowance for home leave and possibly delivery of the food in kind. # Equitable distribution of the ship's food. Same food for staff and crew. # Better supply of smoking materials, the same for staff and crew. # Abolition of censorship of letters. # Consideration of special requirements of individual ships and boats. # No consequences of any type for this demonstration. Sailors' delegations of all units.\\" Plaschka, Cattaro-Prag, p. 59. The rebels sent patrols ashore to persuade more units to join in. A patrol of the G√§a moored off Gjenoviƒá tried to persuade the crews of the nearby torpedo boats and submarines to join in by threat, but without much success. They were partly supported by the local population, throwing stones at the ships. The patrol of Sankt Georg was accompanied by an officer assigned by Rear Admiral Hansa. Hansa hoped to use this to steer the movement in calm waters and to be able to settle it through negotiations. He had assured the rebels, with the exception of those who had used weapons, that they would go unpunished if the uprising was ended. According to Plaschka's assessment, the members of the navy had \\"achieved a unique breakthrough that day.\\"Plaschka/Haselsteiner/Suppan, Innere Front, p. 119 ff. The naval port commandant in Castelnuovo, Feldzeugmeister von Guseck, the local army commander, had been informed of the course of events by Hansa via a telephone line which the insurgents only contained the next day. Guseck initiated comprehensive countermeasures, among them ordering of heavy naval forces from Pola as well as of infantry from the region.Plaschka/Haselsteiner/Suppan, Innere Front, p. 121-125.The German submarines sailed into the inner bay in the evening, which was perceived as a threat by the insurgents.Plaschka, Cattaro-Prag, p. 67. =Second day of the uprising, 2 February 1918= In the morning, Guseck's ultimatum was presented to the central committee: all crews had to return to order and discipline within three hours, otherwise order would be restored by all means. The central committee, however, presented new demands to Hansa, including :\\"2. Agreement with factors from both houses of the House of Deputies. In addition, within 14 days deputies (or their representatives) should arrive at the Bocche [Bay of Kotor] for direct communication with the delegates of the Navy. \\" A senior NCO, the Titularbootsmann Franti≈°ek RaschFranti≈°ek Rasch, born 1889 in Prerau in Moravia, had a German father and a Czech mother. Spelling of his name according to the register of births and baptisms; scan available at: . His name is sometimes also written Franz Rasch or Franti≈°ek Ra≈°. from the lighting department in Kumbor now served as spokesman for the central committee. Hansa promised benevolent consideration and renewed his offer of immunity from prosecution in case of termination of the movement. This led to heated discussions at \\"St. Georg\\" as many wanted to give up. Franti≈°ek Rasch Finally, the only officer who had made himself available to the movement, navy officer cadet Anton SesanAnton Sesan born 1892 in Lopud near Ragusa (the old name of Dubrovnik, see Vesel√Ω, Povst√°n√≠, p. 41 f. ), came from a seafaring family of Serbian nationality and was a captain in the merchant navy before he was drafted (Plaschka/Haselsteiner/Suppan, Innere Front, p. 131). from the naval aviation department in Kumbor, whom Rasch had won over for leading the action, managed to convince the crew to persevere. The delegates now went back to their ships and stations. Hansa arranged for an extension of the ultimatum. One condition was that no ship movements would take place.Plaschka/Haselsteiner/Suppan, Innere Front, p. 128-132. Sesan suggested that the ships should risk an advance into the Adriatic Sea in order to attract international attention and to encourage the crews of other nations to take action as well. Rasch, however, was counting on the approaching troops to show solidarity. The fleet remained in the bay.Frei, Cattaro, p. 66 f.This debate is also described by Vesel√Ω (Povst√°n√≠, p. 56 f.) and in the report of the auditors mentioned below (pp. 1099); see also Fitl, Cattaro, p. 112 f. Plaschka sees in Rasch the determining element of the revolt, who also clearly addressed the social-revolutionary perspective in his comments to Hansa: \\"that the system in the state must be overthrown.\\" Richard G. Plaschka: Avantgarde des Widerstands. Modellf√§lle milit√§rischer Auflehnung im 19. und 20. Jahrhundert. 2 volumes. Vienna 2000, p. 255. Around 2 p.m., the crew committee of the \\"SMS Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf\\", which had been deployed as a guard ship at the harbour entrance off Porto Rose, decided to shift to the second, inner bay of Teodo to join the other rebel ships. In the process, the ship was fired upon by a land-based battery. Two dead sailors, among them Petty Officer Second Class Sagner, an important leader on the ship, were the result. The action, which was intended to lift the mood among the insurgents, caused great consternation in their ranks.Plaschka/Haselsteiner/Suppan, Innere Front, p. 132 f. After the delegates of the fast cruiser \\"Novara\\" had returned from the flagship to their ship, the crew voted to keep the red flag as well. But the commander overrode their decision and ordered the ship to sail into the inner bay. In doing so, he allowed those sailors who feared being torn between the forces to leave the ship. When passing the \\"SMS Kaiser Karl VI\\", which was not far away, the red flag was put down. The rebels' threat to fire on falling off ships was not carried out. Later the other fast cruiser \\"SMS Helgoland\\", the torpedo boats and the destroyers followed. A new front against the revolting ships had emerged in the inner bay. Also the German submarine commanders were prepared to torpedo the rebellious ships if necessary.Plaschka/Haselsteiner/Suppan, Innere Front, p. 133 ff. During the night the central sailors' committee tried to send two telegrams by radio to Dr. Adler in Vienna and Count K√°rolyi in Budapest. They were asked to call on the government to intervene immediately, as to the committee‚Äôs opinion the advance of the infantry may cause a general unrest in the Austro-Hungarian military. However, the committee had to rely on the land-based transmitter of the Naval Port Command. The stations on board had been manipulated by the specialist operators, so that the range was severely limited.Even on the first day the rebels had tried to telegraph to Pola to ask the sailors there to join. But the telegram did not reach Pola. Guseck did not let the telegrams pass.Plaschka/Haselsteiner/Suppan, Innere Front, p. 118, 136 f.Halpern, Cattaro, p. 60 f., 71 f. =The third and last day of the uprising, 3 February 1918= In the morning at 7:30 a.m. the 3rd Division from Pola with Erzherzog Ferdinand Max, Erzherzog Friedrich, and Erzherzog Karl as well as torpedo boats and destroyers entered the outer bay of Cattaro. The ultimatum had finally been set at 10 o'clock. On the remaining ships with red flags more and more crew members wanted to give up. According to the description by Vesel√Ω and from the Central Military Archives in Prague, the photo shows the crew assembled at the stern of Sankt Georg at the surrender on 3 February 1918 at 10 a.m. In the middle, the ship's commander von Scheibenhain can be seen. However, the description cannot be regarded as fully reliable, since no sources are given Rasch and Sesan tried in the morning to persuade the crew of the G√§a to persevere, but most of them they could no longer convince. Sesan went to the airfield. Rasch went back to the Sankt Georg.Plaschka, Cattaro- Prag, p.158 f. There the crew demanded to vote again and it became clear that only very few were still in favour of the continuation of the uprising. Rasch ordered to drop the red flag and reported to Rear Admiral Hansa as a prisoner. Thereafter the few remaining ships also dropped the red flag; the rebellion ended. Sesan managed to escape to Italy with an aircraft together with Gustav Stonawski, who had chaired the central committee, and another NCO.Plaschka/Haselsteiner/Suppan, Innere Front, p. 141. Legal processing On the same day, the disembarkation and detention of those crew members classified by the commanders as \\"irresponsible elements\\" began. There was no uniform policy, so that even committee members who had acted in the officers' interests, as well as crew members who had not joined the uprising but were generally considered unreliable, were among the 678 arrested.Fitl, Cattaro, p. 149 f. Peter Fitl has examined the procedures more closely in a publication published in 2018. =Drumhead court martial= Feldzeugmeister von Guseck, the commander of the naval port, had been charged with the prosecution. He selected 40 personsThe 40 persons are listed by name in Frei, Cattaro, p. 136 f. for the drumhead court martial. He demanded a quick conviction. The trial began on 7 February and must not take longer than three days. The charge was insurrection. The accused were assigned four officers as defence lawyers. The civilian lawyer Dr. Mitroviƒá arrived only at the end of the last day of the trial. After a protest by the defence that the Pr√§klusivfrist (expiration period) had been exceeded, the court declared that it had no jurisdiction over 18 defendants. Fitl criticises that in the event of an actual expiration (which cannot be determined nowadays), this should have applied to all the defendants.Fitl, Cattaro, p. 157. The defence attempted to decline the responsibility of the defendants: compulsion of the circumstances, carried away by the others, fear of artillery fire from \\"St. Georg\\", \\"G√§a\\", \\"Monarch\\".Plaschka/Haselsteiner/Suppan, Innere Front, p. 141-146. An important question was who had used weapons. In the case of the chief officer of the \\"St. Georg\\", Zipperer, it could not be clarified beyond doubt neither in the drumhead court martial nor later on in the ordinary court martial whether ≈†i≈ægoriƒá or Ujdur or both had fired at him.Fitl, Cattaro, p. 89 f. The defence lawyers protested when on the last day of the trial several witnesses who had been summoned were not heard. They also wanted to hear further witnesses in favour of the defendants. The requests were rejected, probably also because the court was under time pressure.Plaschka/Haselsteiner/Suppan, Innere Front, S. 144. Finally, six men were found guilty of the crime of insurrection; out of these Franti≈°ek Rasch, Anton Grabar, Jerko Sisgoriƒá and Mate Berniƒçeviƒç received the capital punishment, Franz Bajzel and Ludwig Szekacs were sentenced to aggravated imprisonment (ten and five years respectively), and two men were acquitted. The remainder were handed over to the court martial. On the same day, the judges deliberated on a pardon petition to Guseck for those sentenced to death (a common procedure according to Fitl), and the majority voted in favor. Guseck rejected this application and confirmed the death sentences on 10 February.Fitl, Cattaro, p. 158 ff. The civil lawyer Dr. Mitroviƒá sent a plea for clemency to the emperor, which he justified among other things by the unfair conduct of the trial. The emperor did not reply. The summary execution took place early in the morning on 11 February 1918, below the cemetery walls of the nearby village ≈†kaljari. They were buried in a common grave.Chris Johnstone: The Czech-led naval mutiny during World War One. Broadcast by Radio CZ in English language on 3 February 2018. Retrieved 23 March 2020, from: . In the programme the historian Jind≈ôich Marek was interviewed. =Investigations= The ship commanders could now once again report potential defendants for the court martial. In some cases this resulted in an increase in some cases in a reduction of the number compared to the previous reports. A total of 45 persons were added to the 678 arrested. But Guseck decided that only 392 persons were to be questioned.Fitl, Cattaro, p. 164. The interrogations began in April. The requirement to submit a written copy of the arrest warrant and an order of preliminary investigation was not complied with. The arrested persons were also not made aware of the possibility of lodging a complaint.Fitl, Cattaro, pp. 165-168. The investigations were conducted by ten military lawyers (Auditoren), who also looked intensively into possible exculpatory aspects. The suspicions expressed by naval officers that the Entente had had a hand in the matter or that there had been agitation by political or national agents turned out to be groundless. In June, the investigations were finalised and the reports (Referate und Antr√§ge)An example is the report written by the auditors on the events at \\"St. Georg\\", which was digitized by the Austrian State Archives and published on the Internet: Gericht des k.u.k. Kriegshafenkommandos in Cattaro: S.M.S. ‚ÄûSt. Georg‚Äú. Referat und Antrag. Typoscript vom 9. April 1918, √ñsterreichisches Staatsarchiv/Kriegsarchiv, Signatur KA MAG KT.1. Available at: . were submitted. They requested that 234 of the accused be charged with mutiny or insurrection and that the remaining 351 be spared from prosecution. However, Guseck ordered charges against 392 persons, the remaining 193 were then released, or in some cases disciplined and in a few cases transferred to another court.Fitl, Cattaro, p. 189 ff. =Court-martial= Guseck issued an indictment against 386 defendants at the end of August. Fitl suspects that the original indictment was flawed. The trial under auditor Major Wolf began on 16 September 1918 and took place in a sardine factory in Mulla near Cattaro. Guseck granted Wolf a public prosecutor he had requested. This was, Fitl concluded, not compatible with even contemporary ideas of a fair trial.Fitl, Cattaro, p. 213f. The officials took measures that news of the uprising and the legal proceedings should not be leaked. However, Julius Braunthal who was deployed in the region as a lieutenant in an artillery emplacement had already succeeded in February in informing Victor Adler of the SP√ñ. Adler spoke to the War Minister on February 11. The minister promised to prohibit further executions. In return, the SP√ñ refrained from making the events public. It was not until 8 October that insurrection and military court trials were discussed in the Reichstag, because of a query of the South Slavic deputy Dr. Anton Koro≈°ec. Giving in to the growing public pressure, Emperor Karl decided to continue the trial only against 31 \\"ringleaders, principal offenders and non- commissioned officers\\". Thereafter 348 persons were acquitted, but transferred to Pola.Fitl, Cattaro, p. 224‚Äì228. On 31 October, the 37th day of the hearing, the trial was adjourned to 5 November. However, it could not be resumed due to political developments. According to Fitl a grotesque situation, because the South Slavic nations had already separated from the Habsburg monarchy; Emperor Karl had handed over the fleet to the newly founded South Slavic state; the k.u.k. court martial had finally tried crew members of the navy of a foreign state on a foreign territory. The trial was not concluded. ref>Fitl, Cattaro, p. 226 f. Consequences The Commander-in-Chief of the Austro-Hungarian Navy Admiral Maximilian Njegovan was forced to ask for his retirement after these events. He was replaced by Mikl√≥s Horthy who was promoted to Counter-admiral. Rear Admiral Hansa was also replaced, the \\"St. Georg\\" was taken out of service and converted into a residential ship. While the army had been the decisive opponent in these events, also the incidents in this unit increased in 1918.Plaschka, Cattaro-Prague, p. 147 f. See e.g. the Judenburg mutiny. Reception The events received little public attention. It was not until nine years later that the journalist and doctor of philosophy Bruno Frei published a comprehensive study of the events in the newspaper Der Abend.Frei, Cattaro. He had access to the copies of the minutes of the drumhead court martial. These are now considered to be lost. Although Frei's work was rather propagandistic in the sense of his socialist and later communist world view, it is therefore also of interest to historians. In addition, some contemporary witnesses now came forward.Fitl, Cattaro, p. 228-233. =Monographs= In 1958 the Czech Jind≈ôich Vesel√Ω published a small book about the events: \\"Povst√°n√≠ v Boce Kotorsk√© (Czech: Uprising in the Bay of Kotor). He also published a series of photos in the appendix. According to Fitl, he overemphasized the contribution of the Czech sailors. Plaschka's 1963 dissertation \\"Cattaro-Prag\\" is still considered the standard German-language work. The most extensive and significant study next to it was written by the Croatian Bernard Stulli: \\"Ustanka mornara u Boki Kotorskoj (Croatian: Sailors' revolt in the bay of Cattaro)\\". Both worked through the files in the Austrian State Archives, which had then become accessible.Fitl, Cattaro, p. 233-235. An Italian book on the events (La rivolta di Cattaro) appeared in 1935. The author, Capitano Neri, misappropriated the protagonists as pioneers of the Italian-nationalist ideology of irredentism.Fitl, Cattaro, p. 235. Important studies in English language were presented by Sondhaus and Halpern in 2001 and 2003 respectively. =Evaluations= After the First World War, the uprising in Austria and Hungary was predominantly perceived as subversive and harmful, while in the other successor states a rather positive perception was noticeable. After the Second World War, the Yugoslav and Czechoslovak Communist states, as well as Marxist Eastern European historiography, assessed the events as both Slavic and Bolshevik.Paul Lenormand: Mutiny of Cattaro. In: 1914-1918-online. International Encyclopedia of the First World War. Plaschka came to the conclusion that the actions in Cattaro had been designed as a revolutionary demonstration. The red flags turned the demonstration into a rebellion. The events revealed a clear crack in the structure of the armed power. The determining element was not so much the unresolved nationality question but rather the social and political question.Plaschka/Haselsteiner/Suppan, Innere Front, pp. 107 f., 112, 129. According to the naval historian Halpern the event cannot be portrait as the beginning of the end of the monarchy, but as its last victory over the social forces that would eventually overwhelm it.Halpern, Cattaro, p. 54. Using selected historical sources, Kuhl compared the Cattaro uprising with the Kiel mutiny. He found clear parallels between the events. But the action in Cattaro had begun when the great wave of strikes in the country had just ended. Thus the action came too late and remained isolated in contrast to the events in Kiel. In Kiel, the sailors and stokers got into contact with a workforce and land-based navy personnel that immediately supported them.Klaus Kuhl: Das Aufbegehren der Matrosen von Cattaro im Februar 1918 ‚Äì ein Vorl√§ufer des Kieler Matrosenaufstands?

Its boundaries are defined in large part by the village's position at the junction of Perkiomen Creek and the Schuylkill River. History The two waterways defined much of the village's early history. In 1825, the Schuylkill Navigation Company completed the Schuylkill Canal and Brower's Locks at Oaks, and the system was heavily traveled. The village of Oaks was named after the canal's designer, Thomas Oakes. Later in the nineteenth century, the railroad largely supplanted the role of the canal. The Perkiomen Railroad built the Oaks station in 1868. The Philadelphia and Reading, sometimes referred to as the Reading Railroad, merged the short line as its Perkiomen Branch. Oaks village cropped up around the station. Famous residents of Oaks have included Jacob G. Francis, founder of Elizabethtown College, and Harry Whittier Frees. Present Today, the village of Oaks is set in dense suburbs. Many of its original structures remain, including the general store, the locktender's house, and many historic homes. Although the tracks are no longer in service in the center of Oaks, a station built in 1918 to replace the original is still located today at the intersection of Egypt Road and Station Avenue. In 1985, construction of the eastern portion of US Route 422 was completed, connecting King of Prussia to Oaks and out to Reading and beyond, and spurring growth in the area. However, Oaks remained less developed than its suburban neighbors, due to a limited number of connections to its wastewater treatment plant. As plans for a new plant began, development started in the retail space next to the highway, starting with the construction of several modern box store retailers and a 24-theater cinema. In 2008, the expanded Oaks Wastewater Treatment Plant was completed, and a new round of both housing and retail growth began, including the opening of the Greater Philadelphia Expo Center. Interest in resuming rail service was spurred by the Schuylkill Valley Metro (SVM) project, which was rejected by Federal Transit Administration in 2006. Another cancelled proposal called the Greenline would have made Oaks the terminus of a new rail line to Paoli, with a new station located adjacent to the Expo Center. Attractions Arnold's Family Fun Center 422 Business Center Public attractions in Oaks include the Lower Perkiomen Valley Park, as well as the Schuylkill River Trail and the Perkiomen Trail. The private West Collection of artwork is open to the public at the headquarters of SEI Corporation, and Oaks is now home to the Greater Philadelphia Expo Center. It is also home to Arnold's Family Fun Center, the region's largest indoor entertainment center. Another attraction is the American Treasure Tour. Oaks is home to the Oaks Race & Sportsbook, an off-track betting and sports betting facility operated by Parx Casino and Racing. The ZIP code is 19456. Sports Oaks was the home of the Valley Forge Freedom of the Mid-Atlantic Hockey League.

It is celebrated on 23 February, except in Kazakhstan, where it is celebrated on 7 May. History First celebrated in 1919, the holiday marks the date in 1918 during the Russian Civil War when the first mass draft into the Red Army occurred in Petrograd and Moscow (on 17 February). In January 1919, it was decided to combine the celebration of that day with the anniversary of the publication of the decree on the establishment of the Red Army (of 18 February 1918). In 1919, 17 February fell on a Monday, so it was decided to move the holiday to the nearest Sunday ‚Äì 23 February. That choice of day has been retained ever since.

The holiday is celebrated with parades and processions in honor of veterans, and women also give small gifts to men in their lives, especially husbands (or boyfriends, fiances), fathers, sons and brothers. As a part of the workplace culture, women often give small gifts to their male co-workers. Consequently, in colloquial usage, the holiday is often referred to as \\"Men's Day\\" ().

The catalytic combustion wick was developed and patented by Maurice Berger, a French pharmaceutical dispenser, in 1898 as a means of purifying the air in hospitals and mortuaries. It is claimed that this catalytic oxidation process destroys bacteria in the air and increases oxygen levels. The fragrance lamp's process is initiated by igniting the stone burner seated at the mouth of the lamp. After two minutes the flame is extinguished by blowing it out. The heated burner remains active as the flame- less catalytic combustion process and diffuses the combusted alcohol and any added aromatics throughout the room. The lamp does not operate with an open flame, making it much safer to operate than scented candles. Its lower operating temperature also means that, unlike scented candles, the aromatics are diffused very efficiently into the ambient air without being burned. Hazard Warning The original Berger lamp used methyl alcohol, while modern lamps use isopropyl alcohol (90% or more). Perfumes or essential oils may be added. To start the catalytic process it is necessary to allow the wick to thoroughly absorb the fuel and then to light the catalytic burner with a flame and let it burn for approximately two minutes until the catalytic stone reaches the correct operating temperature. At this point the flame should be extinguished in order for the oil to be diffused through the catalytic process. Precautions should be taken to avoid any possible hazards: * Make sure the fuel container is in perfect condition, perfectly tight and not leaking. * When not in use, make sure the airtight cap is on at all times to prevent evaporation (alcohol vapour/air mixture is highly flammable). * Do not leave unattended during operation. * Do not use in an unventilated room. * Do not inhale, ingest, or use the lamp fuel in any other manner. * Take extreme caution while refilling the fragrance lamp. Make sure there is ventilation, and that there is no open flame. * In case of any spillage, wipe the area carefully before lighting the lamp. * Do not fill lamps on wooden furniture or use a lamp without a dish underneath it. The fuel will damage furniture.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Phillies, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Seattle Mariners. Ruiz stands tall, and weighs . He bats and throws right-handed. As a seven-year-old, Ruiz resolved to play in the big leagues after both his father and grandmother died within two weeks of each other. He made his way through the Phillies farm system from until , playing at each level of Minor League Baseball (MiLB). Ruiz soon fulfilled his childhood dream, making his MLB debut with the 2006 Phillies. He battled adversity in his progression through the system, including feeling homesick, a position change, and the language barrier (he spoke Spanish, while most teammates and team officials spoke English). Ruiz spent his first full season in MLB in and remained there until he left the Mariners, electing free agency after the season. In , for his strong postseason performance, including a walk-off hit, during the Phillies playoff run that concluded with victory in the 2008 World Series, he earned the nickname \\"Se√±or Octubre\\" (Mr. October). Despite being one of the quietest players on the team, Ruiz was subsequently called the \\"heart and soul\\" of the Phillies, serving as a constant source of encouragement and rebuke alike to his teammates. Over the following seasons, he was a part of the core group of players that led the Phillies to five consecutive playoff appearances, from 2007 until 2011. Ruiz had his best season in 2012, holding a batting average of over .300, earning his first appearance in the All-Star Game, and finishing in the top 30 of the NL Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting. In 2013, he began the season with a 25-game suspension for using Adderall, and subsequently spent time on the disabled list, ultimately playing in fewer than 100 games for the first time in his MLB career. Ruiz is the only player in the history of the NL to catch four no-hitters, and one of only two catchers in the entire MLB (the other being Jason Varitek). Early life Ruiz grew up in David, Chiriqu√≠, Panama, and was the oldest of three sons. His father was a police officer and his mother was an elementary school teacher. When he was seven years old, his father Joaquin was patrolling in his police jeep when a tire blew out, causing the vehicle to flip, throwing Joaquin into a ditch, and then crushing him when it fell on top of him. Just weeks before, his grandmother died of cancer. As a result, Ruiz became \\"the new father\\", starting work shortly thereafter as a laborer on a coffee farm to supplement the family income, and by age 10 was earning about per day. He also promised his widowed mother that he would make it to Major League Baseball to support the family. Subsequently, he began attending college to earn a degree in physical education, but dropped out shortly after he began to attend the Phillies baseball academy. Ruiz's upbringing contributed to his approach to the game. His mother insisted that he excel academically, and would not allow him to play baseball unless he did well in school. Baseball was his first love, and he was responsible for organizing the community's games: Professional career =Minor leagues= In 1998, Ruiz followed his dream of playing professional baseball first by attending the Phillies Baseball Academy in La Vega, Dominican Republic, where he played catcher for the first time, moving from his initial position of second base. Though he was ready to quit because \\"he looked and felt like a 10-year-old among the tall, athletic prospects surrounding him\\", his uncle convinced him in a phone conversation to stick with it. The Phillies signed him as an amateur free agent on December 4, 1998 for , and he made his professional debut in 1999 with the Dominican Summer League (DSL) team DSL Phillies, with whom he compiled a .305 batting average, 4 home runs, and 35 runs batted in (RBIs) in 60 games. Prior to the 2000 season, Ruiz met Mick Billmeyer, the Phillies' minor league catching coordinator, who served as his mentor. Billmeyer sought to learn Spanish while Ruiz sought to learn English, and the two bonded as Billmeyer helped mold Ruiz into an eventual top prospect and ultimately a starting catcher. In 2000, he came to America, progressing to play in the Gulf Coast League (GCL) for the GCL Phillies, and hitting .277 in 38 games. He earned another promotion in 2001, playing for the Lakewood BlueClaws of Class A Minor League Baseball. In 2001, his performance was similar in quality to his first two seasons, and he was promoted to the Clearwater Threshers of Class A-Advanced, with whom he played over parts of the next two seasons. He struggled at the plate in 2002, compiling just a .213 batting average in 92 games, but hit .315 in 15 games in 2003, and that year earned another promotion. In 2004, Ruiz spent the entire season with the Double-A Reading Phillies, posting a .284 batting average and hitting 17 home runs, the latter of which was second among catchers in the Eastern League. In addition to his strong offensive numbers, he threw out 25 of 76 attempted base stealers (32.9%). Off the field, it was in 2004 that Ruiz first gained the original form of his nickname \\"Chooch\\". Though a quiet individual, Ruiz frequently muttered \\"chucha\\" (a strong curse word in Panama) under his breath, and teammate Anderson Machado thus began to address Ruiz as \\"chucha\\", which was later shortened to \\"Chooch\\", and the nickname's usage snowballed from there. His strong performance earned him another promotion in 2005 when he played for the Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons, and posted a better batting average but fewer home runs than in Reading: .300, 4 home runs, 40 RBIs in 100 games. Before the 2006 season, he played for his native Panama in the first World Baseball Classic. His final season in the minor leagues was 2006. During 100 games, he hit .307 with 16 home runs and 69 RBIs, earning International League all-star accolades. He moved back and forth between Triple-A and the major league Phillies all year long, making his MLB debut on May 6, 2006. =Philadelphia Phillies= 2006 Ruiz during 2007 Spring training Ruiz was first brought up to the major league level when Phillies' starting catcher Mike Lieberthal went on the DL in May 2006, and Ruiz debuted on May 6. When Lieberthal returned, Ruiz was sent back to the minors. When Lieberthal went once again on the DL in June, the Phillies used Sal Fasano and Chris Coste rather than recalling Ruiz. He was recalled on July 4, when he hit his first major league home run off San Diego Padres' pitcher Clay Hensley. He was optioned back to the minor leagues once more before his recall on August 31‚Äîessentially a September callup. Overall, with the big league club, he hit .261 with 3 home runs and 10 RBIs. 2007 Ruiz permanently joined the Phillies' roster on opening day 2007, after eight seasons in the minor leagues. He ultimately \\"grabbed hold of the top job [as starting catcher] and never let go\\". The Phillies signed Rod Barajas before the season because of concerns about Ruiz's ability to catch, hit, and generally hold up over a full season at the major league level, as seasons there are longer than in the minor leagues. During the season, he honed his confidence and earned the trust of the Phillies' pitching staff, including veteran Jamie Moyer, who commented, \\"I see a real assuredness to his body language. He's not cocky or brash. He just seems very confident in what's going on.\\" On June 26, Ruiz stole home on the front end of a double steal in an 11‚Äì4 home win over the Cincinnati Reds, becoming the first Phillie to steal home since Scott Rolen in 1997. He eventually played 115 games over the season, and from then on was the Phillies' regular starting catcher. Statistically, he committed only two errors, which tied for second-best among MLB catchers with at least 100 games played. He had 27 multi-hit games, hit 6 home runs and 51 RBIs with a .259 batting average. At the conclusion of the season, he was named to the Topps All-Star Rookie Team. 2008 Ruiz entered the 2008 season focused predominantly on defense, specifically helping the pitcher: Ruiz struggled to hit consistently throughout the season, specifically in the first half; from the beginning of the year until July 11, he hit .206 with 2 home runs and 20 RBIs. Nevertheless, due to his rapport with the pitching staff (pitchers' earned run average when throwing to him was 3.56, the best for any catcher in the National League), and a vote of confidence from manager Charlie Manuel, he was secure in his position. In late July, he had a multi-hit game against the New York Mets, which may have helped him break out of his slump. Ultimately, during the regular season, he hit .219 with 4 home runs and 31 RBIs. Despite his struggles at the plate during the regular season, Ruiz was an integral part of the Phillies' postseason success. After the Phillies clinched the 2008 National League Championship Series, he commented that the glory of winning a crucial baseball game that clinched the series, which he had witnessed while growing up in Panama on television, \\"happened to me\\", noting the aura of the moment, and that it culminated and validated the hard work he had put in over the years.Stark, p. 142 Subsequently, in game 3 of the 2008 World Series, Ruiz tapped a ground ball up the third-base line for a walk-off infield single, the first in MLB history. Ruiz noted, \\"I heard them cheering. And that's when I knew, 'Okay it's over' ... I'll take a win.\\"Stark, p. 178 The Phillies eventually won the World Series for the first time since 1980, doing so in five games, the last of which began on October 27 and ended on October 29 after it was suspended part- way through due to rain. For his performance in the playoffs, he earned the nickname \\"Se√±or Octubre\\" (Mr. October in Spanish). 2009 Initially, Ruiz elected not to play in the 2009 World Baseball Classic, but after receiving a call from Mart√≠n Torrijos, the President of Panama, he agreed to play for the Panamanian team. Early in the season, he suffered a muscle strain in his right oblique, which lost him playing time while on the disabled list. Also early in the season, there was debate as to who should be the Phillies starting catcher, Ruiz or Chris Coste. Rob Neyer summarized the debate and ultimately endorsed Ruiz when he wrote, Ruiz warming up in the bullpen Ultimately, Ruiz was the regular starter. He finished the season on a hot streak; over the last 24 games, he hit .355 with 9 doubles, 1 home run, 11 RBIs, and .446 on-base percentage (OBP). In late September, he missed a week of games with inflammation in his left wrist. Despite his missed time, he started 100 games and set career highs in home runs (9) and base on balls (47), as well as posting a .255 batting average and 43 RBIs. Moreover, he walked more times than he struck out, a rare feat among modern major league hitters. In the postseason, he led the team with a .341 batting average, and recorded a .491 OBP, having reached base in each of the Phillies' 15 games, which perpetuated the usage of his nickname \\"Se√±or Octubre\\". Marcus Hayes of the Philadelphia Daily News wrote that Ruiz is \\"... the Phillies' Senor Octubre, a No. 8 hitter who hits like John Buck in the regular season, then turns into Johnny Bench come autumn.\\" 2010 In 2010, Ruiz had a season filled with \\"indelible moments\\". He was catcher for Roy Halladay's perfect game on May 29, 2010 against the Florida Marlins and Halladay's no-hitter against the Cincinnati Reds in the first game of the National League Divisional Series on October 6, 2010, the first time a catcher had caught two no-hitters in one season since 1972. On May 4, he hit a walk-off home run, the second of his career, to lead the Phillies over the St. Louis Cardinals. Ruiz spent time on the DL in late June and early July with a concussion, but according to manager Charlie Manuel returned with a more efficient swing that allowed him to hit better against power pitchers. He led the team with a .302 batting average and a .400 on-base percentage. Both statistics also led National League catchers, and he even received a few votes for NL most valuable player. During the 2010 postseason, he did not perform as well as in past years‚Äîin nine games, he hit .192 with two home runs and four RBIs. Fans voted Ruiz the \\"X-Factor Player of the Year\\" in MLB's This Year in Baseball Awards.Go to 2010 This Year in Baseball Awards and click on \\"X-Factor\\" for results and video. MLB Advanced Media. Retrieved September 5, 2011. He also received the Pride of Philadelphia Award from the Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame. Halladay called Ruiz a \\"rock\\" behind the plate, and presented him with a replica of his Cy Young Award. 2011 Ruiz returned for the Phillies' 2011 season as their everyday starting catcher, and started 113 games, of which the Phillies won 70 (.619 winning percentage). In May, he spent time on the DL with inflammation in his lower back. Over the Phillies' final 36 games, he posted a .342 batting average. Overall, he finished with the best catcher's ERA in the major leagues (3.06), a .283 batting average, 6 home runs, and 40 RBIs. His batting average was second on the team trailing only Hunter Pence. 2012 Ruiz hitting in a game against the Baltimore Orioles on June 8, 2012 Ruiz began the 2012 season strongly, and throughout the season was a bright spot on an otherwise disappointing team. Through June 27, he led the Major Leagues with a .364 average. This contributed to a stellar first half of the season earned him his first placement on the National League All-Star team. He was a reserve, though some analysts, including ESPN's John Kruk, felt his numbers warranted a starting nod, which ultimately went to the San Francisco Giants' Buster Posey through the fan voting. Shortly after the announcement that he was an all-star, a piece in The Philadelphia Daily News entitled \\"The evolution of Carlos Ruiz\\" summarized his career: \\"Ruiz, though, was never a major prospect. He was a reserve catcher before he was a starting catcher. He was a bottom-of-the-order hitter before he was a middle-of-the- order hitter. And now, for the first time in his career, Carlos Ruiz is an All-Star.\\" After the all-star break, he spent over a month on the disabled list with plantar fasciitis, hindering his statistical totals, which at the time of his injury were among the best in the National League. He led all NL catchers in doubles, en route to posting a .325 batting average with 16 home runs and 68 RBIs, all of which were career highs. He finished 28th in MVP voting, the third consecutive season he had received votes. 2013 On November 27, 2012, Ruiz was suspended for 25 games without pay by the MLB for testing positive for an amphetamine called Adderall. The suspension of Ruiz was effective at the start of the 2013 season. Adderall is a drug prescribed for treating ADHD, described as a \\"central nervous system stimulant used to increase the attention span and decrease distractibility.\\" He made his 2013 season debut on April 28 against the New York Mets at Citi Field. On May 20, he was placed on the DL with a Grade 2 strained hamstring. He came back with a four-hit game, which tied his career high, against the Los Angeles Dodgers on August 18, and hit .288 over the final two months of the season, commensurate with his past performance. In the 2013 season, Ruiz compiled a .268 batting average, five home runs, and 37 RBIs in 92 games, his lowest major league total since 2006. After the season, Ruiz became a free agent. He re-signed on November 21, 2013 to a three-year contract worth plus a club option for a fourth season, giving the Phillies have an option to bring Ruiz back for a fourth season, at their discretion. Though one writer suggested his 2013 year might just have been an \\"aberration\\", most thought the Phillies overpaid to keep Ruiz, who turned 35 during the subsequent offseason. 2014 Before the 2014 season, he received an exemption from MLB to use Adderall, an exemption given to nine percent of MLB players despite only four percent of the American population diagnosed with the condition. After a slow start, Ruiz earned NL player of the week accolades in late April after he hit .500 during a Phillies' road trip. He sustained a concussion on June 26 that forced him to go on the disabled list; he began a rehabilitation assignment on July 17 with the Clearwater Threshers. On September 1, Ruiz was behind the plate for the combined no-hitter thrown by Cole Hamels, Jake Diekman, Ken Giles, and Jonathan Papelbon in a 7-0 victory over the Atlanta Braves. In 2014, Ruiz played 110 games batting .252 with six home runs and 31 RBI, and overall, had \\"a fine season ... [that] shouldn‚Äôt get lost amid the many negatives.\\" On October 1, 2014, Ruiz underwent a minor arthroscopic shoulder surgery. 2015 Cognizant of his increasing age and the wear catching places on one's body, the Phillies reduced Ruiz's workload during spring training, hoping to keep him fresh throughout the regular season. Regardless, he insisted upon catching pitchers' bullpen sessions so he could develop a feel and rapport with each pitcher. On July 25, Ruiz became the first catcher in the National League, and the second catcher in Major League Baseball history, to catch four no-hitters when teammate Cole Hamels no-hit the Chicago Cubs. Overall, Ruiz lost his starting job to Cameron Rupp, and had significant declines in many aspects of his game, particularly those at which he previously excelled, including framing pitches ‚Äì in 2015, Baseball Prospectus ranked him worst in the league at doing so ‚Äì and the mental aspect of the game, as he made several uncharacteristic errors. 2016 =Los Angeles Dodgers= The Phillies traded Ruiz to the Los Angeles Dodgers on August 25, 2016, with cash considerations, for A. J. Ellis, Tommy Bergjans, and a player to be named later. The player to be named later turned out to be Joey Curletta. He backed up Yasmani Grandal with the Dodgers in September, appearing in 14 games and hitting .278. He was also two for four as a pinch hitter, with a three-run home run in the 2016 National League Division Series. =Seattle Mariners= Following the 2016 season, Ruiz was traded to the Mariners for pitcher Vidal Nu√±o. In a game against the Minnesota Twins, Ruiz pitched in the 8th inning, giving up one run and striking out Kennys Vargas for Ruiz's first career strikeout. On a July 7 game against the Oakland Athletics, while in the bullpen, he caught Nelson Cruz's 300th home run. On November 2, 2017, Ruiz elected free agency. Player profile Ruiz (left) built a rapport with many members of the Phillies' pitching staff, as starting catcher. =Batting= Offensively, Ruiz developed from a \\"bottom-of-the-order hitter\\", to a patient hitter inclined to work the count, and finally to a hitter with solid gap-to-gap power. Ruiz has strong plate discipline that helps him draw walks and avoid strikeouts; he has almost as many walks as strikeouts over the course of his career, a rarity in the modern era of baseball. However, as his career progressed and he hit more towards the middle of the lineup, he has taken a more aggressive approach at the plate, and consequently he has struck out more often, but his home run totals have also increased. In 2014, his versatility and production at the plate encouraged his manager, Ryne Sandberg, to utilize him in various spots ranging from second through seventh in the batting order. At the prime of his career, he was among the best hitting catchers in MLB. Entering 2014, Ruiz had stolen only 16 bases over his first eight seasons; he had never been particularly fast, which initially caused his conversion from infielder to catcher, but because of his \\"hustle\\" on the basepaths, he won the Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association Heart and Hustle Award in 2012. =Catching= When catching, Ruiz seeks to become \\"one\\" with the day's pitcher; he takes their successes and failures personally, refusing to blame pitchers, and accepts equal responsibility. Phillies pitchers trust Ruiz and his ability to call games, and this ability's improvement has coincided with his increased proficiency in English. Cole Hamels attributes Ruiz's prowess in calling games to astute preparation, commenting, Ruiz realizes the importance of his role with the Phillies, opining, \\"It's the catcher's job to bring energy and happiness to the game.\\" Ruiz has a good throwing arm that has improved over the years; over the course of his career he has thrown out 29% of attempted base stealers, which is exactly the average percentage of baserunners thrown out by catchers. =Playing style= A Sports Illustrated piece featuring Ruiz published in July 2011 encapsulated Ruiz's role as \\"heart and soul\\" of the team: He is a favorite among Phillies fans, and crossed \\"a cultural moat that Hispanic players often can't\\" to endear himself to not only the fan base, but also his teammates.

History The band was formed in 2001 under the name of Means 2 An End as a three-piece by main-songwriter and lyricist Matt Goud. They were originally from the small city of Dauphin, Manitoba. In 2003, they relocated to Regina, Saskatchewan. They eventually integrated elements of hardcore into their sound and dropped \\"2 An End\\" from their name. It was around this time, in 2005, that original bassist Blair Roberts quit to pursue a family. He was replaced by Dylan Johnstone, formerly of Yorkton, Saskatchewan hardcore group Statement of Service. They remained a three-piece until mid-2006 when Wells joined so Johnstone could switch to lead vocals. This era of the band saw them switch to a mainly metalcore sound inspired by Shai Hulud and Misery Signals. The group toured in the US and Canada, and was featured in the June 2007 issue of Alternative Press magazine as well as multiple other publications. Their 2007 album, Sending You Strength, was released in the US on Facedown Records.Review of Sending You Strength. Geekburger. Accessed December 15, 2007.Review of Sending You Strength . Decoy Music.

The mall is located in Hamburg, New York at the intersection of McKinley Parkway and Milestrip Road (New York State Route 179) immediately east of I-90 and the New York State Thruway. McKinley Mall services the Southtowns of Erie County, New York. The mall's anchor stores are Bed Bath & Beyond, Best Buy, Old Navy, Barnes & Noble, JCPenney, and Dipson Theatres. There are 4 vacant anchor stores that were once Sears, The Bon-Ton, and 2 Macy's stores. History The McKinley Mall opened in 1985 in Hamburg, New York with Sears and local chain AM&A;'s as anchor stores. At the time, the mall featured approximately 80 inline, a food court known as \\"The Garden\\" and a six screen Dipson Theatres (only accessible outside.) The construction of the mall in the early 1980's brought a wave of controversy throughout the town of Hamburg as the town was divided over whether or not the mall should be built. The land the mall was built on was largely parkland and the surrounding land that has now become fully developed was also primarily undeveloped. 1988 brought the opening of an 88,000 square foot Sibley's store on the back side of the mall and local chain L.L. Berger opened a 40,000 square foot store on the back side of the mall in 1989. 1989 also saw the opening of the Walden Galleria 10 miles north in Cheektowaga. A super-regional mall, the Galleria helped accelerate the death of many surrounding malls including the Seneca Mall, and the Thruway Mall. However, the Mckinley Mall continued on almost unfettered, as it served the Southtowns of Western New York and brought shoppers from Pennsylvania and the Southern Tier of New York. 1990 saw the relocation of JCPenney from the Seneca Mall in West Seneca, which was three miles away, effectively ending that mall's existence. 1990 also saw the conversion of Sibley's into Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania based Kaufmann's and in 1991, L.L. Berger closed, quickly being converted into a Kaufmann's Home Store. Throughout the 1990's, the presence and success of the McKinley Mall brought enormous growth in peripheral retail surrounding the property. Surrounding the mall within the property included the opening of stores such as Circuit City, Pier 1 Imports, Media Play, Dollar Tree, and Rosa's Home and Furniture Store. Likewise, many restaurants opened surrounding the property including Olive Garden, Red Lobster, and TGI Friday's. Outside the mall on McKinley Parkway and Milestrip Road, stores such as Home Depot, BJ's Wholesale Club, Old Navy, Toys \\"R\\" Us, JoAnn Fabrics, Office Max, A.C. Moore, T.J. Maxx, Wegmans, and Aldi. Restaurants that opened outside the mall included Ruby Tuesday, Applebee's, Friendly's, and Outback Steakhouse. 1994 brought the opening of York, Pennsylvania based The Bon-Ton after they purchased Buffalo based AM&A;'s the same year. The mall continued on relatively stable throughout the rest of the 1990s and into the 2000s until 2005 when it was announced that Bed Bath and Beyond would open a store in the Sears wing on the mall's western side. One year later, in 2006, Best Buy announced they would open a store at the mall next door to Bed Bath and Beyond. Later that year, Federated Department Stores announced the acquisition of May Department Stores and Kaufmann's and its sister home store were converter to Macy's. 2008 saw the opening of Barnes and Noble. The Great Recession of 2008 hurt many malls across the United States and the McKinley Mall was no exception, seeing many chains such as The Disney Store, Kay Bee Toys Hollister, Mrs. Fields, Radioshack and Reed's leave the mall. 2009 saw the opening of ULTA Beauty and in 2011, Old Navy moved into the mall where Kay Bee Toys used to be. The 2010s saw the mall face a downturn in fortunes as many national chains including Gap, Aeropostale, PacSun, Finish Line, Deb, and Regis Hairstylists, began to leave the mall in a flood. By 2016, seeing a decline in the mall's fortunes, Macy's, announced they would close both of their stores at the mall leaving almost 130,000 square footage at the mall vacant. This set off another wave of closures including Payless, Hallmark, and MasterCuts. In 2017, Sears closed their Auto Center. 2018 saw another exodus of stores at the mall as Icing, Wet Seal, and The Bon-Ton closed due to bankruptcy, and ULTA Beauty relocated to Quaker Crossings, three miles east in Orchard Park. With the closure of The Bon-Ton, this left the mall at approximately 65% vacant with Sears and JCPenney left as the only major anchor stores. Zales moved into the mall in 2018, in the center concourse near The Bon-Ton's former store. 2019, brought about the closing of Kay Jewelers, and Vitamin World. In November of 2019, after over 34 years of business, Sears, one of the last remaining original tenants at the mall, announced they were closing their store, their last remaining location in Western New York, and of the last between Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York altogether. This store closed on February 16, 2020. At 140,000 square feet and approximately 20% of the malls leasable square feet, Sears' departure dealt a huge blow to the mall leaving a whopping 45 percent of the mall's leasable square footage vacant. Sears' closure, coupled with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, set the mall into a rapid downward spiral. The onset of the pandemic forced all malls to close in response to lockdown orders nationwide, and the prolonged closure, resulting economic downturn, and recession, left many malls including the McKinley Mall, in dire straits. Longtime tenants such as GNC, New York & Company, Parkside Candy, and Things Remembered closed during this time. Also during this time, The Garden food court, once home to nine eateries, has become completely abandoned. At approximately 50% occupancy, the mall's future is bleak.

He was, however, elected as one of the 90 representative peers designed under the provisions of the act to remain in the House of Lords. He has since blocked further reform of the Lords, tabling 'wrecking' amendments to a draft Bill to abolish by-elections for hereditary peers, proposed by Lord Grocott in 2018. Caithness is an opponent of fractional-reserve banking.House of Lords record, February 2009, Hansard archives Caithness was a trustee of Queen Elizabeth Castle of Mey Trust, from its inception in 1996 until 2016.

Summary Setting: Lahore Time: 1943 - 1948 This novel is generally referred to as a story about the Partition of India ‚Äì hence the title ‚Äì but its original title was ‚ÄúIce- Candy-Man‚Äù which allows for broader interpretation of the story. The plot involves Lenny, a 4-year-old Parsee girl who recounts her childhood memories after she is struck by polio in her infancy. She spends most of her time with her ayah Shanta, an 18-year-old Hindu girl from Amritsar. Their relationship is the main narrative because Lenny spends a lot of time with her Ayah and she learns a lot about adult relationships from being with the voluptuous nanny and her very diverse group of admirers. Sexual awakening is a major theme of the book but so is communal identity as the story takes place between 1943 and 1948 when India gained independence but was split into two countries. Ayah's admirers are a cross section of the Lahore residents before Partition. Lenny has a lot of female relatives and this novel has a plethora of characters, but Ayah is the one she is most intimate with. Partition does not really affect Lenny until, during the chaos of 1947, she accidentally betrays Ayah's presence in the house and Ayah is carried off by an angry Muslim mob. The tone of the novel, written almost completely in the present tense, is rather caustic and remote much like the relationship between the children and their parents. This distance is enforced by the fact that in a couple of passages the writer reveals that she conjured up this little girl and her memories 40 years after they happened. The consistent use of the present tense makes the memories extra vivid but the insights, the language and the humor are not always those of a little girl. Only the stories the adults tell Lenny and a special section called ‚ÄúRanna‚Äôs story‚Äù are written in the past tense. Ranna‚Äôs story is the grueling report on how the great grandson of Imam Din, the family cook, - whom Lenny met on a visit to his village - witnessed the murder of his entire village and barely escaped alive. The telling of it is the more striking because of the change of voice as the extreme violence would be hard to convey through the eyes of an 8-year-old girl who was not there. Once Partition and Pakistan become the new reality, the children worry about what may have become of Ayah. Lenny's mother and aunt are involved in taking care of fallen women, victims of the violence now rejected by their families. Then they see Ayah in a car, dressed up and made up like a Bollywood star. They find out that she is living in the Kotha, the disreputable part of the old city with Ice-Candy-man, one of her former admirers who has now transformed himself into an Urdu poet but pimps her out and represses Ayah ruthlessly. Lenny's godmother intervenes and they extricate Ayah from her captivity in order to let her return to her family village. The book is made up of many lively and interesting anecdotes, some of them related to Partition, but just as many to Lenny's personal development and the unique position of the Parsees in Lahore and in India. Some of the chapters carry forward the plot but many of them do not but they leave an indelible impression of a community in a place that was permanently transformed in a matter of months.

Condrey featured five pitches: a sinker, cutter, curveball, changeup, and a four-seam fastball. Early life The right-handed pitcher played at Navasota High School and McNeese State University. The New York Yankees selected Condrey in the 94th round, with selection No. 1,730 of the 1996 Major League Baseball draft out of Angelina (Texas) Junior College. Professional career Condrey would eventually sign with the San Diego Padres in 1998. He was signed by then- Padres scout Theo Epstein. Condrey pitched with the San Diego Padres in the and seasons before he moved to the Phillies in the offseason. In the Padres organization as a starter, Clay started 43 games between the Triple-A Portland Beavers and the major leagues, giving up 118 earned runs in 257.1 innings (ERA of 4.13). Condrey pitched his entire season for the Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes- Barre Red Barons of the International League, where he led the team in starts and innings pitched (28 ST, 162 IP), compiling an ERA of 5.50. His campaign dropped slightly in appearances, where he appeared in only 24 starts (132.1 IP), but he subsequently lowered his ERA to 4.15.

He was born in Elberfeld, Germany and died in West Point, California.Kracht, C., & Woodard, D., Five Years (Hanover: Wehrhahn Verlag, 2011), p. 185. Early life Germer studied in a university, worked as a military intelligence officer in the First World War and received first and second class Iron Crosses for his service. In 1923 he sold his Vienna property and founded the publishing house Pansophia Verlag in Munich. Germer stayed with his first wife at the Abbey of Thelema from the beginning of January until February 1926.Kaczynski 2010, p. 423 Immigration to the United States: 1926-1935  In 1926, Germer got married for the second time and immigrated to the USA, his wife being an American citizen. By 1927 Germer and his wife Cora Eaton were living in New York where Germer worked as a merchant of machinery. There, in his capacity of Grand Treasurer General of the O.T.O. Germer begun raising funds for the Order. Money was always a problem but Germer saw that Crowley must have it so that the work could go on and the books could be published. He raised funds for Crowley in one way or another, his own or the money of O.T.O members whom he could interest in donating it to the O.T.O. By 1930, Germer and his second wife travelled to Europe had stayed with Crowley for a short while to raise funds for the exhibition of Crowley's paintings in Germany. Germer wanted to help Crowley to be published, and help Thelema to be put across by his art work and by the distribution of Crowley's publications. Since he had business experience, he did well at this, even though he did not have enough funds during much of that time. Holocaust and the aftermath: 1935-1940 =Rise of Nazi Germany= Germer's US visa expired and he had to return to Germany in 1935. When Adolf Hitler came to power, Germer came under suspicion because of his association with Crowley and teaching Thelema in Germany. Hitler was given a copy of Liber AL, the Holy Book of Thelema, by Martha Kuntzel who enjoyed a high reputation in Germany amongst aristocrats. Kunzel had been working for some years on translations of Crowley's works into German. She had also presented Liber AL to Hitler as she thought highly of him before he came to power. Liber AL was known well enough in higher German circles after Kunzel translated and introduced it to German public and soon after the start of World War II, Hitler banned it in Germany, as well as the books on religion, qabala, astrology, esoteric studies and gematria. Hitler knew enough about Thelema to ban Liber AL in Germany and thus Germer became his enemy when his religious beliefs became known. On Hitler's orders Germer was arrested by the Gestapo on 13 February 1935 in Leipzig and incarcerated. He was first held at the Columbia-Haus prison in Berlin. There he was allowed to work a short time on an architect's office. =Esterwegen concentration camp= Having seen too much of Hitler's brutality at Columbia-Haus, Germer wrote to his wife about it. At around the same time, his wife Cora contacted the American Consulate in Berlin who pleaded for Germer's return to the US as his wife was a US citizen. This was seen as a crime by the Nazis and they punished Germer even further, deporting him to the Esterwegen concentration camp on the Dutch Frontier where thousands of Hitler's so-called political enemies were deported by the Nazis. Germer remained there for seven months, witnessing cruelties of various sorts on the Nazi side. His wife Cora now did not know where he was and there was nothing else for her to do but to return to America, where she again began her appeal to various US authorities. When they helped her to find out where he was, she sent Germer a cable. Germer wrote a reply to her and it was read by the Nazis which resulted in Germer being placed in solitary confinement. He was no longer allowed to read and for six weeks, he never saw the day nor was allowed in the open air. =Years in Belgium and France= At the end of August of that year Germer was temporarily freed from detention at Esterwegen, his case being that be had been a Major in World War I on the German side and was also of pure German blood, therefore the charges were too vague to get any real case against him. Germer moved to Belgium where he took an apartment and started working as an exporter of heavy farm machinery in Brussels, making frequent trips to England and Ireland. This was with great difficulty as the war and Hitler's movements were making travel difficult. In Brussels Germer had the means to store his personal belongings, his diaries and other things at a friend's house. Between 1939 and 1940 he wrote 223 pages of his autobiographical book \\"Protective Prisoner No 303\\" about his experiences in the concentration camp, which he wanted to publish. On May 10, 1940, when the Germans marched into Belgium Germer was again incarcerated. As the Germans advanced, Germer was transferred to the French authorities who held him in a French concentration camp of L√©vitan and was later sent to the camp of Saint-Cyprien camp in the Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales where 90,000 Spanish refugees were interned in March 1939. It was officially closed on 19 December 1940 for \\"sanitary reasons\\". Its occupants, including Germer, were transferred to the Camp of Gurs where in October 1940 thousands of Jewish women, children, and the elderly, who had not gone to the Nazi concentration camps in Germany, were deported from the Baden region of Germany as per official Nazi policy which was overseen by Adolf Eichmann. =Liberation and return to the United States= On September 1, 1941 a non-quota immigration visa had been obtained for Germer by his American wife. But French authorities made it almost impossible for Germer to obtain the permit before, despite all kinds of urgent steps that were undertaken by his wife and the American Ambassador and Consul. French authorities only gave him permission to go to Marseille to see the American Consul four months after the visa was granted. After being released from the Nazi concentration camp in February 1941, Germer returned to the United States. Securing a job as a merchant of machinery upon his return to New York, Germer continued his fundraising activities for Crowley who appointed him his personal representative in the United States. Later life: 1941-1962 =Grand Treasurer General of O.T.O.= Germer had seen that Crowley needed aid to finish his publishing work in his later years. In his capacity of Grand Treasurer General of Ordo Templi Orientis, Germer raised over $25,000 for publishing Crowley's works, as well as support and maintenance. On July 13, 1942, Germer's wife Cora Eaton died of a heart attack. Two months later, on September 23, 1942, Germer married Vienna piano teacher Sascha Ernestine Andre. For many years, he and Sascha sent at least $200 monthly to Crowley, being Crowley's most devoted supporters of their time. =O.H.O. of O.T.O.= In 1942, Crowley appointed Germer as his successor as the Head of Ordo Templi Orientis and he fulfilled that position after Crowley's death in 1947. Germer was also a special appointee of the Order with jurisdiction over Agape Lodge. Germer had had a lot of trouble getting reports from Agape Lodge and answers to his letters from Wilfred Talbot Smith who was the lodge master. Instead, Germer kept in touch with Jane Wolfe who was one of the founding members. Through Wolfe he made acquaintance and good friendship of Phyllis Seckler. Their friendship begun by correspondence when Seckler was in college. Crowley died on December 1, 1947. Since his death, Germer became the Outer Head of the order (O.H.O.) and started working on preservation of Crowley's literary remains and getting his books published. At the time of Crowley's death there were still many important manuscripts which had not been published and Germer sent those to various publishers, getting these works of Crowley published for the first time. In 1953 Germer was introduced to Marcelo Motta and took him as his student in the A.:.A.:. =Move to Southern California= In 1954 Germer retired from his job in New Jersey and moved to California on advice of Jane Wolfe and her student Phyllis Seckler who were his confidants. After about 2 years he found a house in West Point, California where he set up a Head Office of the O.T.O and put together the Order's library containing Crowley works and O.T.O. files which later became a subject of a dispute due to Germer's will being lost or stolen after his death. In January 1957 Marcelo Motta visited Germer at his new headquarters in West Point and in early January 1957 Germer, Jane Wolfe and Motta visited Phyllis Seckler at Livermore, California. It was their last meeting before Germer died. =Final years= In his letters Germer often mentioned his task in life was to support Crowley, and to do his best to publish Crowley's writings. He did not expect to die before accomplishing this task the way he envisaged it, and therefore did not name a successor in his will. =Death= Germer died as a result of prostate cancer in late October 1962. By 1962 the average rate of cancer among Holocaust survivors was nearly two and a half times the national average, while the average rate of colon cancer, attributed to the victims' experience of starvation and extreme stress, was nine times higher. Germer Estate The will Germer made to dispose of Crowley's literary remains kept at his estate provided that all of the Crowley materials should go to the Heads of the Ordo Templi Orientis. Sascha Germer and Frederick Mellinger of Swiss O.T.O. were appointed to act as executors of the will. All Germer's personal property was to be left to Sascha Germer. Personal life Over the course of his life, Germer married and divorced three times; his late wife Sascha Germer was named as one of the executors of his will, in charge of his literary remains. He had no children. Legacy Germer, who was a Holocaust survivor, worked tirelessly to preserve and publish Crowley's work. For quite a few years he had been Grand Treasurer of the Ordo Templi Orientis in charge of Crowley's literary remains, and was so named in Crowley's will. During World War II, at the time of oppression and tyranny by the Nazi party, Germer memorised Liber AL, Liber LXV, and Liber VII, reciting it daily from memory. When Hitler confined him to a solitary state in a German concentration camp, he recited the Holy Books of Thelema to himself, which aided him in performing one of the central tasks of the A‚à¥A‚à¥, being the attainment of the experience known as \\"the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel‚Äù, the attainment of which is the central theme of the order's official instructions.James A.

In his first book, the player starts with five disciplines. With each additional book completed, the player chooses one additional Kai discipline. Plot The Claw of Naar is the evil wand of power used by Agarash the Damned during his ancient conquest of Magnamund. Legend held that it had been lost forever in the molten ruins of Naaros, but now it has resurfaced, and its dread return heralds a dawn of disaster for the peaceable nations of Magnamund. Your allies, the wise wizards of the Elder Magi, have the power and the means to destroy the accursed Claw, but they do not possess it.

He is best known by his alias, Pulsedriver. Career =Early life and career= At the age of 15, Petrovic was fascinated by the worldwide dance music movement. He started DJing in the 1980s in youth clubs, schools and at parties, which he was already organising himself. By the beginning of the 1990s he had established himself in the dance scene under his nickname 'Tibby' and soon he became a popular DJ in the top club locations in Germany. His desire to leave his definition of dance music on vinyl for posterity grew through the experience he was gaining in the clubs. The development from DJ to producer began and the income made from small gigs and part-time jobs enabled him to buy the equipment for his first own studio. In 1994, he released his first own single, under the alias Aqualoop: \\"Twilight Zone\\". The single quickly became popular in clubs. Further singles were released under this name, and other projects followed and were able to add to the success of his first release. In 1997, the project \\"Pulsedriver\\" was born. Slobodan's object was to make music that was driving, kicking, uplifting and melodic. The first single \\"Rhythmic Trip\\" grabbed the attention of the international club and rave scene and with the follow-up releases \\"Time Machine\\" and \\"I'm Rushin'\\" the project Pulsedriver became one of the top established club acts. Bookings followed for live performances and DJing throughout Europe. The first commercial success came with the single \\"Kiss That Sound\\" which was doing well in the dance charts and was his first entry into the German sales chart. The path of success continued to rise with the follow-up releases \\"I Dominate U\\", \\"Take U High\\" and \\"Your Spirit is Shining\\". The single \\"Cambodia\\", a cover of a Kim Wilde song, gave him his first Top 10 single in Germany, a Top 5 single in Austria and achieved chart positions in other countries in Europe. Further singles, such as \\"Din Daa Daa\\", \\"Time\\", \\"Move for Freedom\\", \\"Galaxy\\", \\"Vagabonds\\", \\"Slammin'\\", \\"Insane\\" and \\"Beat Bangs\\" as well as the albums Selected, Sequence and Night Moves all made it into the sales chart. =2000-present= In the 2000s, Pulsedriver founded the record label Aqualoop Records in order to give his ideas and experience as a producer its own platform. The label quickly became one of the most successful dance labels in Germany. Pulsedriver was named \\"Best National Remixer\\" in the years 2002, 2003 and 2004 in succession and his remixes helped numerous acts have club successes. Currently Pulsedriver has made over 200 remixes for acts worldwide.

Background  The son of James Walsh and Hanna Shea, James Anthony was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts. After completing his elementary education in the public schools, he attended Boston College High School where, in extracurricular activities, his skills in debating and journalism were first recognized and developed. He began his college program at Boston College, interrupted it to study bookkeeping, transferred to Harvard College as a \\"special student\\", and completed his studies at St. John's Seminary in Brighton, Boston. He was ordained on May 20, 1892, at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross in Boston. After ordination, Walsh was appointed curate at St. Patrick's Church in Roxbury, where he directed sodalities and organizations for both the young men and women of the parish. In 1903, he was appointed Diocesan Director of the Society for the Propagation of the Faith and in 1907 founded The Field Afar magazine, a monthly publication about the foreign missions of the Catholic Church. Walsh's interest in the foreign missions led to his founding, together with Rev. Thomas Frederick Price, the Catholic Foreign Mission Society of America (C.F.M.S.A.) (commonly referred to as the Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers) in 1911. He acted as spiritual father and co-founder, with Mother Mary Joseph Rogers, of the Foreign Mission Sisters of St. Dominic (now called Maryknoll Sisters of St. Dominic). He served as Superior General of the Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers until his death in 1936. During the founding process and in his service as Superior General, Walsh made trips across the United States, to Rome and to other places throughout the world. In 1933, Walsh was named to the episcopacy as Titular Bishop of Seine. He was consecrated in Rome on June 29, 1933, in the College of Propaganda Fide by Cardinal Fumasoni-Biondi. He died at Maryknoll New York, on April 14, 1936. His teachings as a priest gave students strong encouragement to follow their dreams in life.

His father was the Reverend Wesley Casson, a Methodist missionary, and his mother was Elizabeth Jackson, related to the famous Ulster Jacksons and Confederate General Thomas J \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson. The family moved around due to Casson's father postings. After spending years Manitoba, the family went back to Ontario in 1880, just before the outbreak of the M√©tis rebellion. With no formal schooling, Casson turned to the world around him for education. Casson went to Victoria College in 1890 hoping to study philosophy, but was instead given a theology scholarship. He graduated with a dual degree in 1892. At twenty-three, Casson became an ordained Methodist minister, but was soon tried for heresy and, after being found guilty, resigned his position. He moved to Boston in 1893 and started his career in the publishing field. While in Boston, Casson's attention was called to the immigrant slums. He was so shocked by the conditions he found there, he became a socialist, leading demonstrations and making friends with Keir Hardie in 1897 (British Socialist leader) and Samuel Gompers (American Trade Union). With Hardie he helped form the Independent Labor Party. Then with Walter Vrooman, married to heiress Amne Grafflin, Casson helped buy a college for leaders, flourishing since as Ruskin College at Oxford in 1899. Deserted by his followers for opposing the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Casson moved to the Ruskin Colony, a socialist commune in Tennessee started by Julius Wayland. He left after six months and went to Toledo and worked alongside Samuel M. \\"Golden Rule\\" Jones and ghost-wrote the book \\"The Eight Hour Day.\\" Casson married Lydia Kingsmill Commander just before moving to New York and starting work at New York Evening Journal with Arthur Brisbane under William Randolph Hearst in 1901. He then worked for the New York World, a paper run by Joseph Pulitzer, until 1902. During his career as a journalist, Casson interviewed the likes of then Presidents Grover Cleveland, Benjamin Harrison, Theodore Roosevelt, and Woodrow Wilson, and Guglielmo Marconi, Nikola Tesla, Thomas Edison, and Alexander Graham Bell. Casson then joined Frank A. Munsey from 1905 until 1907 as a special writer resulting in Casson's first book, The Romance of Steel: The Story of a Thousand Millionaires, published in 1907. It detailed the rise of the American steel industry during the late 19th century. Casson also met the Wright Brothers and wrote the notable article, At Last We Can Fly. In 1908, Casson was invited by efficiency experts Harrington Emerson and Frederick W. Taylor to become an associate in the movement. He also freelanced for American Magazine in 1909. Casson then wrote History of the Telephone in 1910. From the preface: \\"Thirty-five short years, and presto! the newborn art of telephony is fullgrown. Three million telephones are now scattered abroad in foreign countries, and seven millions are massed here, in the land of its birth.\\" In 1911, Casson partnered with H. K. McCann and organized the famous advertising company selling, out in 1914. Casson retired in 1914 and moved his family to England. During World War I, Casson gave lectures on the management of factories. He founded the journal Efficiency, which he both published and wrote, in 1915. Casson continued to write and publish until 1950, when he went on a lecturing tour to Australia, New Zealand and Fiji. Casson wrote 168 books on business success.
