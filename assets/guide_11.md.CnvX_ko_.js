The Times of India. (25 October 2016). Retrieved 6 November 2018. Dey sang in all the major regional Indian languages, though primarily in Bengali and Hindi Dey also sang in Bhojpuri, Magadhi, Maithili, Punjabi, Assamese, Odia, Konkani, Sindhi, Gujarati, Marathi, Kannada, Malayalam, and Nepali. His peak period in Hindi playback singing was from 1953 to 1976. His singing was simple and always had a classical touch. Kishore Kumar with his versatile singing according to mood overshadowed him in 70s and 80s. Finally he had to withdraw singing Hindi songs because of inability to improvise as per changing trends in Bollywood. Early life Dey was born in a Bengali family to Mahamaya and Purna Chandra Dey on 1 May 1919 in Calcutta (Now Kolkata). Besides his parents, his youngest paternal uncle, Sangeetacharya Krishna Chandra Dey highly inspired and influenced him. He received his early education at Indu Babur Pathshala, a small pre-primary school. He started doing stage shows in school from 1929. He attended Scottish Church Collegiate School and Scottish Church College.Some Alumni of Scottish Church College in 175th Year Commemoration Volume. Scottish Church College, April 2008. page 589 He participated in sports events like wrestling and boxing in his college days, taking training from Gobar Guha. He graduated from Vidyasagar College. Dey began taking music lessons from Krishna Chandra Dey and Ustad Dabir Khan. During this period, he stood first for three consecutive years in three different categories of inter-collegiate singing competitions. Career =Early career (1942‚Äì1953)= In 1942, Dey accompanied Krishna Chandra Dey on a visit to Bombay. There he started working as an assistant music director first under Krishna Chandra Dey, and then under Sachin Dev Burman. Later, he assisted other music composers and then started to work independently. While working independently as a music director for various Hindi movies, Manna Dey continued to take musical lessons in Hindustani classical music from Ustad Aman Ali Khan and Ustad Abdul Rahman Khan. Dey started his career in playback singing with the movie Tamanna, in 1942. The musical score was by Krishna Chandra Dey and Manna sang a duet named \\"Jago Aayee Usha Ponchi Boley Jago\\" with Suraiya which was an instant hit. But it was only in 1943 that he got his first solo break with Ram Rajya. Incidentally, the producer of the film Vijay Bhatt and its composer Shankar Rao Vyas had approached K C Dey with an offer for playback in the film. When K C Dey refused the offer on the grounds that he would not lend his voice to other actors, they spotted Manna Dey sitting in the corner of the room and offered him the opportunity. Shankar Rao Vyas taught Manna Dey the songs and he chose to sing them in his uncle's distinct style. And thus started the illustrious career with the first song \\"Gayi tu gayi Seeta sati\\"(Ram Rajya, 1943). His songs like \\"O Prem Diwani Sambhal Ke Chalna\\" from 1944 film Kadambari composed by Anil Biswas, \\"Dil Churaney Ki Liye from Dur Chaley\\" (1946) composed by Jafar Khurshid, his duets with Amira Bahee like \\"E Diniya Jara Suney\\" from Kamala (1946) and duet song \\"Aaj Bor Aayee\\" with Meena Kapoor from 1947 film Chaltey Chaltey became chartbusters in respective years. Between 1945 and 1947 many Manna Dey-Rajkumari duets like \\"Hay Gagan Me Badal Tharey\\" in 1945 for the film Vikaramaditya, \\"Aowji Morey\\" from Insaaf (1946), all 4 duets from the film Geet Govind composed by Pandit Indra ‚Äì \\"Kit Ho Nando Kumar\\", \\"Chorr Sakhi Aaj Laj\\", \\"Apney Hi Rang\\", \\"Lalit Labang Lata\\" from Geet Govind became popular. He sang for first time songs composed by Sachin Dev Burman, Upar Gagan Vishal and Duniya Ke Logo in the 1950 movie Mashal, which became popular and from here his association with S.D.Burman began. Its lyrics were written by Kavi Pradeep. In 1952, Dey sang for a Bengali and a Marathi movie with the same name and storyline, Amar Bhupali. This established him as a leading playback singer in Bengali films and Marathi films as well by 1953. In the post independence period, after 1947, Manna Dey was regularly used by music composers Anil Biswas, Shankar Rao Vyas, S.K.Pal, S.D.Burman, Khem Chand Prakash, Mohd.Safi from 1947 to 1957. Dey-Anil Biswas combination gave hit numbers from films like Gajre (1948), Hum Bhi Insaan Hai (1948), Do Sitaare (1951), Hamdard (1953), Mahatma Kabir (1954),Jasoos (1957) and Pardesi (1957). Though Anil Biswas worked with Dey in very few films, their songs remain famous. He recorded his first duet with Shamshad Begum, who was the Hindi female singer most in demand from 1940 to 1961, \\"Phoolon Ka Swapna\\" in the films Girls School (1949) composed by S.K.Pal. His first duet with the then upcoming singer Lata Mangeshkar was \\"Lapat Ke Pot Pahaney Bikral\\" composed by Vasant Desai for Narsingh Avtar (1949), and with Kishore Kumar it was \\"Subaho Ki Paheli Kiran\\" from 1951 film Anadolan composed by Pannalal Ghosh. His first duet with Geeta Dutt was \\"Dhonyo Dhonyo He Ayodh Puri\\" from the film Ram Vivah (1949) composed by Shankar Rao Vyas, first duet with Umadevi (Tun Tun) was \\"Hay Ye Hain\\" from Jangal Ka Jaanwar (1951) composed by Ghantshala. His first duet with the then struggling singer Asha Bhosle was \\"O Raat Gayee Fir Din Aya\\" from 1953 film Bootpolish. Manna Dey established his verstality between 1948 to 1954 by singing not only the classical based film songs but also singing such film songs which were fusion of Indian classical music and pop music and by giving classical music concerts. His experimentation with western music too produced many unforgettable melodies resulting in an increase in singing offers in films from 1955. He began singing ghazals in Hindi films from 1953. He became a music composer in Hindi films when he composed music along with Khemchand Prakash for both Shri Ganesh Janma (1951) and Vishwamitra (1952). =1953‚Äì1967= Manna Dey after Getting D.Litt degree from Rabindra Bharati University (May 2004) By 1954, Manna Dey became popular among musical circle across film industries of various Indian languages. He became nationally famous after release of Do Bigha Zamin (1953) where two of the songs sung by him and composed by Salil Choudhury became hits. Salil Choudhury worked with Dey from 1953 to 1992 in Hindi films and made Dey sing even in Bengali and Malayalam films right from the late 1950s to early 1990s. His association with Shankar-Jaikishan and producer Raj Kapoor had begun while working for Awara, but their combination became famous while working together for Boot Polish in 1954. The trio worked in many films together from 1954 to 1971 whose musical scores were appreciated, irrespective of their box-office fate, like Shree 420, Chori Chori, Mera Naam Joker, Parvarish, Dil Hi to hai, Awara, Sriman Satyavadi, Kal Aaj aur Kaal, Abdullah etc.. The Raj Kapoor- Manna Dey combination produced superhits (both music and film, the only exception being Mera Naam Joker where the songs were chartbusters but the film was a flop) and was a pair to reckon with. While Mukesh sang the slow pathos for Raj Kapoor, Manna Dey sang the fast peppy ones, the classical numbers, the romantic duets (in case one analyses Manna Dey has sung more than 95% of Raj Kapoor's superhit duets) and the naughty numbers. Manna Dey has the rare distinction of doing playback for both father and son ‚Äì Raj Kapoor and Randhir Kapoor (In fact Manna Dey later sang for Rishi Kapoor in Zamane ko dikhana hai). C. Ramchandra worked with Dey very first time in Insaniyaat in 1955 and then recorded songs with Dey consistently even in the 1960s in films like ‚Äì Tallaq (1959), Navrang, Paigham, Stree (1961), Veer Bhimsen etc. In 1956, he sang with a new batch of singers. He recorded his first duets with Sudha Malhotra \\"Ghar Ghar Deep Jalao Re\\" from Ayodhyapati in 1956, with Binata Chatterjee in the duet \\"Tum Mile Mil Gaye Karaar\\" from Grand Hotel (1956) composed by Suresh Talwar, and then his first duet with Sabita Banerjee in the song \\"Jamine Hamari Jamana\\" composed by A.R.Quereshi from Laal-E-Yaman (1956) and with singer Meena Kapoor in the song \\"Rim Jhim Jhim Rim Jhim\\" from Pardesi (1957) composed by Anil Biswas. Dey turned into an independent music composer in Hindi films with Maha Poojaa in 1954. He sang eighty-three Hindi songs in three years from 1953 to 1955 and his demand increased such that he sang 45 songs in the year 1956. His career reached in peak form when he recorded 95 Hindi songs in single year 1957 and 64 in 1958. His peak period in Hindi film industry is considered to be from 1953 to 1969 where he recorded 758 Hindi songs of which 631 came between 1957 and 1969. He worked extensively with other music directors like Naushad, K.Dutta, Vasant Pawar & Ram, Vasant Desai, Ravi, S.K.Pal, Avinash Vyas, S. N. Tripathi, Sanmukh Babu, Nissar Bazmi, Husanlal Bhagatram, B.N. Bali, Sushanta Banerjee, O.P. Nayyar, G.Ramanathan, T.G.Lingappa, Nirmal Kumar, Ghulam Mohhammed, Bipin Dutta, Rabin Banerjee, Roshan, Sapan Jagmohan from 1954 to 1968. New age composers like Kalyanji- Anandji started recording songs with Manna Dey from 1958 and Laxmikant Pyarelal from 1964. Rahul Dev Burman made Manna Dey sing the westernised songs ‚Äì \\"Aao Twist Karen\\" and \\"Pyar Karta Ja\\" which became chartbusters in 1965. But the composers who gave Manna Dey consistent popular song numbers in commercially successful films from 1955 to 1969 were S.D.Burman, C.Ramachandra, Ravi, Avinash Vyas, Vasant Desai, Anil Biswas, Salil Choudhury and Shankar Jaikishan.

Credit is also given to Manna Dey for popularising classical based solo and duet songs to the masses like the duet with Lata ‚Äì \\"Pritam Daras Dikhao\\" from Chacha Zindabad (1959), became a popular song though it was based on classical Raag Lalit. His rendition of \\"Kasame Vaade Pyar\\" from Upkar (1967) pictured on Pran and composed by Kalyanji Anandji won accolades for Dey, and was also significant in Pran's career as he began to do positive roles. Manna Dey gave playback for Raj Kapoor in Shree 420 (Mud Mud Ke Na Dekh), Chori Chori (Yeh Raat Bheegi, Jahan Main Jati and Aja Sanam), Parvarish (Masti bhara hai sama), Dil Hi To Hai (Laga chunari mein daag), Mera Naam Joker (Ae bhai zara dekh ke chalo) and \\"Ek Paon Chal Raha Hai\\" from Kal Aaj Aur Kal (1971).

Reportedly the song \\"Ek Chatur Naar\\" (a duet by Kishore Kumar and Manna Dey) from Padosan (1965) was partly improvised by Kishore Kumar at the time of recording and Manna Dey, determined to show Kishore Kumar how he would sing the duet better (since Kishore had not been trained classically), got into the mood of the song and immortalised \\"Ek Chatur Naar\\". Dey recorded around 31 songs with Kishore from 1951 to 1987 and all of them became chartbusters. From 1969, after release of Aradhana, the highest in demand playback singer was Kishore Kumar, so careers of Mukesh, Rafi and Manna Dey were affected and they got lesser number of songs to sing. His peak period as a playback singer is considered to be from 1953 to 1969 and in the year 1969 it seemed that Dey's career in Hindi films would be over due to resurgence of Kishore Kumar but he had an extended peak period till 1976. The song \\"Tujhe Suraj Kahun Ya Chanda\\" from Ek Phool Do Mali in 1969, S.D. Burman composition \\"Mitwa Mitwa Piya Maine Kya Kiya\\" from Us Paar (1974) and his duet with Shailendra Singh from Bobby ‚Äì \\"Na Maangoon Sona Chandi\\" were a chartbusters in respective years. His song \\"Sawan Ki Rimjhim Main\\" was aired in non-film program section in Vividh Bharati and became popular on the radio. He received a fresh lease of life in his playback singing career from 1971 after Rajesh Khanna allowed music directors to picturise or feature songs sung by Dey in films with Khanna in lead role beginning with Anand, composed by Salil Chowdahry. For Rajesh Khanna, Dey had sung songs \\"Zindagi kaisi hai paheli\\" (Anand, 1971), \\"Tum bin jeewan kaisa jeewan\\" and \\"Bhor Aaye Gaya Andhera\\" (Bawarchi, 1972), \\"Nadiya Chale Re\\" (song sung with Rajesh and Dey), \\"Hasne ki chah ne kitna mujhe\\" (Avishkaar, 1973) and \\"Gori tori paijaniya\\" (Mehbooba, 1976). Later in a 2012 interview, Dey said, \\"I loved the way he picturised music. The success of a song depends upon how an actor picturises it. He was the number one in picturising songs. I will be ever indebted to him.\\" From 1970 to 1983, he recorded around 503 songs used in Hindi films. Thereafter he became selective of the kinds of songs he sings and chose to do less work in Hindi. The demand for Kishore-Manna Dey combination only grew after 1972. Their popular songs were \\"Mere Pyale Mein\\" from Aamir Garib (1974), \\"Is Ishq Mein Har\\" from Mr. Romeo (1974), \\"Yeh Dosti\\" from Sholay (1975), \\"Duniya Me Jeeney\\" from Naukri, \\"Kamal Hain\\" from Karz, \\"Phool Chaahiye Na\\" from Pyas (1982) and their last duet was in 1986 film Maqqar ‚Äì \\"Tu Hi Mera Sapna\\".

Burman and with Lata in \\"Goyakechu Nanche\\" from Manoranjan (1974), \\"Logo Ke Juban Me Apna\\" from Nehla Pe Dehla, both composed by Pancham. Lata and Manna Dey recorded fusion songs, which used both Indian and western instruments. Several such songs included the duets \\"Kaanhaa Bole Naa\\" and \\"Balma Moraa Aanchaar\\" for the film Sangat, composed by Salil Chowdhury in 1975, which became very popular and was picturised on Rakesh Pandey and Kajri.

He was hospitalized again in the first week of October 2013, and died of a cardiac arrest at 3:45 pm on 24 October at Narayana Hrudayalaya hospital in Bengaluru, aged 94. Musicians, politicians, cricketers and other notable persons issued statements on his death. He was cremated at Bengaluru itself. Media Manna Dey 2016 stamp Dey's Bengali language autobiography, Jiboner Jalsaghorey, has been published by the renowned Ananda Publishers in the year 2005 which has been translated in English as Memories Come Alive, in Hindi as Yaden Jee Uthi and in Marathi as Jivanacha Jalasagarat.

Like Linux itself the RTAI software is a community effort. RTAI provides deterministic response to interrupts, POSIX-compliant and native RTAI real-time tasks. RTAI supports several architectures, including IA-32 (with and without FPU and TSC), x86-64, PowerPC, ARM (StrongARM and ARM7: clps711x-family, Cirrus Logic EP7xxx, CS89712, PXA25x), and MIPS. RTAI consists mainly of two parts: an Adeos-based patch to the Linux kernel which introduces a hardware abstraction layer, and a broad variety of services which make lives of real-time programmers easier. RTAI versions over 3.0 use an Adeos kernel patch, slightly modified in the x86 architecture case, providing additional abstraction and much lessened dependencies on the \\"patched\\" operating system. Adeos is a kernel patch comprising an Interrupt Pipeline where different operating system domains register interrupt handlers. This way, RTAI can transparently take over interrupts while leaving the processing of all others to Linux. Use of Adeos also frees RTAI from patent restrictions caused by RTLinux project. RTAI-XML RTAI-XML is a server component of RTAI, implementing a service-oriented way to design and develop real-time (RT) control applications. This project was born to fulfill the needs of a university group, mainly focused to have a flexible platform for learning control systems design, allowing the students to test their programs remotely, over the Internet. Leaving the first wishful thinking and going to the real implementation gave rise to the alpha version of RTAI-XML, that showed the potential impact of the basic idea of a net separation of hard and soft real- time tasks in the programmation logic. What was necessary to assure that students could not crash the RT process, is now becoming a new RTAI paradigm. RTAI-XML consists of a server component waiting for incoming calls on a box where a real-time process, the Target, is running (or ready to). A generic client program, the Host, can reach the server through the TCP/IP network, using a standard protocol based on XML, and hence interact with the Target, in order to monitor the status of the RT process, to see the signals collected (or generated) by the system and also to fetch and change the RT parameters (for example, the gains of a PID feedback ring). In other words, RTAI-XML provides a simple way towards remoting of control applications, adding flexibility to the RTAI project, without losing the key features of an open and standard implementation. The RTAI-XML section of this site presents the details of the implementation. The general architecture is revised, in order to focus the three key components, the Server, the Server-Target interface and the Server-Host communication. The Applications section contains some examples of control systems based on RTAI-XML and the References section contains hints and links for further readings on this topic.

It is distinct from other nanokernels in that it is not only a low level layer for an outer kernel. Instead, it is intended to run several kernels together, which makes it similar to full virtualization technologies. It is free and open-source software released under a GNU General Public License (GPL). Adeos provides a flexible environment for sharing hardware resources among multiple operating systems, or among multiple instances of one OS, thereby enabling multiple prioritized domains to exist simultaneously on the same hardware. Adeos has been successfully inserted beneath the Linux kernel, opening a range of possibilities, such as symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) clustering, more efficient virtualization, patchless kernel debugging, and real-time computing (RT) systems for Linux. Unusually among HALs, Adeos can be loaded as a Linux loadable kernel module to allow another OS to run along with it. Adeos was developed in the context of real-time application interface (RTAI) to modularize it and separate the HAL from the real-time kernel. Prior work Two categories of methods exist to enable multiple operating systems to run on the same system. The first is simulation-based and provides a virtual environment for which to run additional operating systems. The second suggests the use of a nanokernel layer to enable hardware sharing. In the simulation category, there are tools such as VMware, Plex86, VirtualPC and SimOS. There is also Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) which is more similar to Adeos, but is not RT and requires specific virtualization hardware support. These methods are used for users who desire to run applications foreign to their base OS, they provide no control over the base OS to the user. Simulation was never meant to be used in a production environment. In the nanokernel category there are tools such as SPACE, cache kernel and Exokernel. All of these suggest building miniature hardware management facilities which can thereafter be used to build production operating systems. The problem of this approach is that it does not address the issue of extant operating systems and their user base. Adeos addresses the requirements of both categories of application by providing a simple layer that is inserted under an unmodified running OS and thereafter provides the required primitives and mechanisms to allow multiple OSes to share the same hardware environment. Adeos does not attempt to impose any restrictions on the hardware‚Äôs use, by the different OSes, more than is necessary for Adeos‚Äô own operation. Instead, such restriction is to be imposed by the system administrator or the system programmer. This exposes the system to mismanagement, but the idea behind Adeos is to give back control to system administrators and programmers. Architecture Adeos architecture. Adeos implements a queue of signals. Each time that a peripheral sends a signal, the different operating systems that are running in the machine are awakened, in turn, and must decide if they will accept (handle), ignore, discard, or terminate the signal. Signals not handled (or discarded) by an OS are passed to the next OS in the chain. Signals that are terminated are not propagated to latter stages. As Adeos has to ensure equal and trusted access to the hardware, it takes control of some hardware commands issued by the different OSes; but, it also must not intrude too much on the different OSes‚Äô normal behavior. Each OS is encompassed in a domain over which it has total control. This domain may include a private address space and software abstractions such as process, virtual memory, file-systems, etc. Adeos does not attempt to impose any policy of use of the hardware except as needed for its operation. The task of determining policy is left to the system architect. =Adeos interrupt pipe= Adeos interrupt pipe. Adeos uses an interrupt pipe to propagate interrupts through the different domains running on the hardware. As some domains may prefer to be the first to receive hardware interrupts, Adeos provides a mechanism for domains to have access to priority interrupt dispatching. In effect, Adeos places the requesting domain's interrupt handler and accompanying tables, which may be called as an interrupt mechanism in SPACE terminology, at the first stages of the interrupt pipeline. Domains can control whether they accept, ignore, discard or terminate interrupts. Each of these has a different effect and is controlled differently. Accepting interrupts is the normal state of a domain's interrupt mechanism. When Adeos encounters a domain that is accepting interrupts it summons its interrupt handler after having set the required CPU environment and stack content for the interrupt handler to operate correctly. The OS then may decide to operate any number of operations including task scheduling. Once the OS is done, the pipeline proceeds as planned by propagating interrupts down the pipeline. When an OS in a domain does not want to be interrupted, for any reason, it asks Adeos to stall the stage its domain occupies in the interrupt pipeline. By doing so, interrupts go no further in the pipeline and are stalled at the stage occupied by the domain. When the OS is done wanting to be uninterrupted, it asks Adeos to install the pipeline and thereafter all the interrupts that were stalled at the corresponding stage follow their route to the other stages of the pipeline. When a domain is discarding interrupts, the interrupt passes over the stage occupied by the domain and continues onto the other stages. When a domain terminates interrupts then the interrupts that are terminated by it are not propagated to latter stages. Interrupt discarding and termination is only possible when the OS in a domain recognizes Adeos. Since some OSes do not recognize Adeos, it is possible to create a domain which only serves as a handler for that OS. Hence, in the interrupt pipeline, this stage always precedes the handled domain's stage and may take actions for that domain with Adeos in order to provide the handled domain's OS with the illusion of normal system operation. Once Adeos is done traversing the pipeline it checks if all domains are dormant. If that is the case, it then calls on its idle task. This task remains active until the occurrence of the next interrupt. If all the domains aren't dormant it restores the processor to the state it had prior the interrupt entering the pipeline and execution continues where it had left. Since Adeos is very much hardware dependent, many details are specific to one of its particular implementations. Applicability =General-purpose operating system resource sharing= General-purpose operating system resource sharing is one of the main objectives of Adeos, to provide an environment which enables multiple general purpose OSes to share the same hardware. =Operating system development= Developing OSes is usually a complicated process which sometimes requires extra hardware such as in-circuit emulators to probe the hardware on which an OS is running. Using Adeos, OS development is eased since any undesired behavior may be controlled by an appropriate domain handler. It can also provide a default domain handler for OS development under which developers may have controlled direct access to the hardware they are meant to control. As Adeos is itself a kernel-module, such development domain handlers may be developed independently from Adeos. =Patchless kernel debuggers and probers= Adeos provides for a way for kernel debuggers and probers to take control of Linux without modifying Linux. As with other Adeos domains, these facilities would load as normal kernel modules and would thereafter request a ring-zero domain from Adeos. Once that is done, they may request priority interrupt dispatching in the interrupt pipeline. Hence, before Linux gets to handle any interrupts, they will be able to intercept those interrupts and carry out the requested debugging tasks. This can also be extended to performance profilers and other such development tools.

Mosaicism has been reported to be present in as high as 70% of cleavage-stage embryos and 90% of blastocyst-stage embryos derived from in vitro fertilization. Genetic mosaicism can result from many different mechanisms including chromosome nondisjunction, anaphase lag, and endoreplication. Anaphase lagging is the most common way by which mosaicism arises in the preimplantation embryo. Mosaicism can also result from a mutation in one cell during development in which the mutation is passed on to only its daughter cells. Therefore, the mutation is only going to be present in a fraction of the adult cells. Genetic mosaics may often be confused with chimerism, in which two or more genotypes arise in one individual similarly to mosaicism. In chimerism, though, the two genotypes arise from the fusion of more than one fertilized zygote in the early stages of embryonic development, rather than from a mutation or chromosome loss. Types Different types of mosaicism exist, such as germline mosaicism (restricted to the gametes) or somatic mosaicism. = Germline mosaicism = Germline or gonadal mosaicism is a special form of mosaicism wherein some gametes‚Äîi.e., sperm or oocytes‚Äîcarry a mutation, but the rest are normal. The cause is usually a mutation that occurred in an early stem cell that gave rise to all or part of the gametes. = Somatic mosaicism = Somatic mosaicism occurs when the somatic cells of the body are of more than one genotype. In the more common mosaics, different genotypes arise from a single fertilized egg cell, due to mitotic errors at first or later cleavages. In rare cases, intersex conditions can be caused by mosaicism where some cells in the body have XX and others XY chromosomes (46, XX/XY). In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, where a fly possessing two X chromosomes is a female and a fly possessing a single X chromosome is a sterile male, a loss of an X chromosome early in embryonic development can result in sexual mosaics, or gynandromorphs. Likewise, a loss of the Y chromosome can result in XY/X mosaic males. The most common form of mosaicism found through prenatal diagnosis involves trisomies. Although most forms of trisomy are due to problems in meiosis and affect all cells of the organism, some cases occur where the trisomy occurs in only a selection of the cells. This may be caused by a nondisjunction event in an early mitosis, resulting in a loss of a chromosome from some trisomic cells. Generally, this leads to a milder phenotype than in nonmosaic patients with the same disorder. An example of this is one of the milder forms of Klinefelter syndrome, called 46,XY/47,XXY mosaic wherein some of the patient's cells contain XY chromosomes, and some contain XXY chromosomes. The 46/47 annotation indicates that the XY cells have the normal number of 46 total chromosomes, and the XXY cells have a total of 47 chromosomes. Also monosomies can present with some form of mosaicism. The only non-lethal full monosomy occurring in humans is the one causing Turner's syndrome. Around 30% of Turner's syndrome cases demonstrate mosaicism, while complete monosomy (45, X) occurs in about 50‚Äì60% of cases. Mosaicism need not necessarily be deleterious, though. Revertant somatic mosaicism is a rare recombination event with a spontaneous correction of a mutant, pathogenic allele. In revertant mosaicism, the healthy tissue formed by mitotic recombination can outcompete the original, surrounding mutant cells in tissues such as blood and epithelia that regenerate often. In the skin disorder ichthyosis with confetti, normal skin spots appear early in life and increase in number and size over time. Other endogenous factors can also lead to mosaicism, including mobile elements, DNA polymerase slippage, and unbalanced chromosomal segregation. Exogenous factors include nicotine and UV radiation. Somatic mosaics have been created in Drosophila using X‚Äëray treatment and the use of irradiation to induce somatic mutation has been a useful technique in the study of genetics. True mosaicism should not be mistaken for the phenomenon of X‚Äëinactivation, where all cells in an organism have the same genotype, but a different copy of the X chromosome is expressed in different cells. The latter is the case in normal (XX) female mammals, although it is not always visible from the phenotype (as in calico cats). However, all multicellular organisms are likely to be somatic mosaics to some extent. Somatic mutation leading to mosaicism is prevalent in the beginning and end stages of human life. Somatic mosaics are common in embryogenesis due to retrotransposition of L1 and Alu transposable elements. In early development, DNA from undifferentiated cell types may be more susceptible to mobile element invasion due to long, unmethylated regions in the genome. Further, the accumulation of DNA copy errors and damage over a lifetime lead to greater occurrences of mosaic tissues in aging humans. As longevity has increased dramatically over the last century, human genome may not have had time to adapt to cumulative effects of mutagenesis. Thus, cancer research has shown that somatic mutations are increasingly present throughout a lifetime and are responsible for most leukemia, lymphomas, and solid tumors.  Brain cell mosaicism  A frequent type of neuronal genomic mosaicism is copy number variation. Possible sources of such variation were suggested to be incorrect repair of DNA damages and somatic recombination.  Mitotic recombination  One basic mechanism that can produce mosaic tissue is mitotic recombination or somatic crossover. It was first discovered by Curt Stern in Drosophila in 1936. The amount of tissue that is mosaic depends on where in the tree of cell division the exchange takes place. A phenotypic character called \\"twin spot\\" seen in Drosophila is a result of mitotic recombination. However, it also depends on the allelic status of the genes undergoing recombination. Twin spot occurs only if the heterozygous genes are linked in repulsion, i.e. the trans phase. The recombination needs to occur between the centromeres of the adjacent gene. This gives an appearance of yellow patches on the wild-type background in Drosophila. another example of mitotic recombination is the Bloom's syndrome, which happens due to the mutation in the blm gene. The resulting BLM protein is defective. The defect in RecQ, a helicase, facilitates the defective unwinding of DNA during replication, thus is associated with the occurrence of this disease.King R. C; Stansfield W. D. and Mulligan P. K. 2006. A Dictionary of Genetics. 7th ed, Oxford University Press. p282 Use in experimental biology Genetic mosaics are a particularly powerful tool when used in the commonly studied fruit fly, where specially selected strains frequently lose an X or a Y chromosome in one of the first embryonic cell divisions. These mosaics can then be used to analyze such things as courtship behavior, and female sexual attraction.. More recently, the use of a transgene incorporated into the Drosophila genome has made the system far more flexible. The flip recombinase (or FLP) is a gene from the commonly studied yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that recognizes \\"flip recombinase target\\" (FRT) sites, which are short sequences of DNA, and induces recombination between them. FRT sites have been inserted transgenically near the centromere of each chromosome arm of D. melanogaster. The FLP gene can then be induced selectively, commonly using either the heat shock promoter or the GAL4/UAS system. The resulting clones can be identified either negatively or positively. In negatively marked clones, the fly is transheterozygous for a gene encoding a visible marker (commonly the green fluorescent protein) and an allele of a gene to be studied (both on chromosomes bearing FRT sites). After induction of FLP expression, cells that undergo recombination will have progeny homozygous for either the marker or the allele being studied. Therefore, the cells that do not carry the marker (which are dark) can be identified as carrying a mutation. Using negatively marked clones is sometimes inconvenient, especially when generating very small patches of cells, where seeing a dark spot on a bright background is more difficult than a bright spot on a dark background. Creating positively marked clones is possible using the so-called MARCM (\\"mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker\\" system, developed by Liqun Luo, a professor at Stanford University, and his postdoctoral student Tzumin Lee, who now leads a group at Janelia Farm Research Campus. This system builds on the GAL4/UAS system, which is used to express GFP in specific cells. However, a globally expressed GAL80 gene is used to repress the action of GAL4, preventing the expression of GFP. Instead of using GFP to mark the wild-type chromosome as above, GAL80 serves this purpose, so that when it is removed by mitotic recombination, GAL4 is allowed to function, and GFP turns on. This results in the cells of interest being marked brightly in a dark background. History In 1929, Alfred Sturtevant studied mosaicism in Drosophila. In the 1930s, Curt Stern demonstrated that genetic recombination, normal in meiosis, can also take place in mitosis.Stern, C. and K. Sekiguti 1931. Analyse eines Mosaikindividuums bei Drosophila melanogaster. Bio. Zentr. 51, 194199.Stern C. 1936. \\"Somatic crossing-over and segregation in Drosophila melanogaster\\". Genetics 21, 625730. When it does, it results in somatic (body) mosaics. These organisms contain two or more genetically distinct types of tissue.Stern, Curt 1968. \\"Genetic mosaics in animals and man\\". pp27129, in Stern, C. Genetic Mosaics and Other Essays. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA. The term \\"somatic mosaicism\\" was used by C. W. Cotterman in 1956 in his seminal paper on antigenic variation.

It is most prominent in Asian cultures but it is also typical of nobility and aristocracy in many European countries. It is also used in religious contexts, as a form of worship or veneration. Sometimes the gesture may be limited to lowering the head such as in Indonesia, and in many cultures several degrees of the lowness of the bow are distinguished and regarded as appropriate for different circumstances. It is especially prominent in Nepal, India, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, China, Korea, Japan, and Vietnam where it may be executed standing or kneeling. Some bows are performed equally by two or more people while others are unequal ‚Äì the person bowed to either does not bow in return or performs a less low bow in response. A nod of the head may be regarded as the minimal form of bow; forms of kneeling, genuflection, or prostration which involves the hands or whole body touching the ground, are the next levels of gesture. In Europe and the Commonwealth Man bowing and scraping In European cultures‚Äîaside from bows done by performers on stage such as at the curtain call‚Äîbowing is traditionally an exclusively male practice, and women instead perform a related gesture called a \\"curtsey\\" or \\"curtsy.\\" The depth of the bow was related to the difference in rank or degree of respect or gratitude. In Early Modern European courtly circles, males were expected to \\"bow and scrape\\" (hence the term \\"bowing and scraping\\" for what appears to be excessive ceremony). \\"Scraping\\" refers to the drawing back of the right leg as one bows, such that the right foot scrapes the floor or earth. Typically, while executing such a bow, the man's right hand is pressed horizontally across the abdomen while the left is held out from the body. Social bowing is all but extinct, except in some very formal settings, though hand-kissing of women by men, which of necessity includes a bow, lingers on in some cultures. In the British, Australian, and other Commonwealth courts lawyers and clerks (of both sexes) are expected to perform a cursory bow of the head only to the judge when entering or leaving a law court that is in session. Similar gestures are made to the Speaker of the House of Commons when entering or leaving the chamber of the House of Commons in session, and to the monarch by her staff. Members of the Royal Family of the various Commonwealth Realms are either bowed or curtsied to, depending on the gender of the subject. Australians are expected to bow to the Governor-General of Australia, the spouse of the Governor-General and state Governors and Lieutenant- Governors.Title and Greeting Governor of New South Wales In Asia =In East Asia= Students wearing suits, hakama and a kimono bow to the president of the school and then to the audience at the 2015 Waseda University graduation ceremony in Japan. Bows are the traditional greeting in East Asia, particularly in Japan, Korea, China, and Vietnam. In China, and Vietnam, shaking hands or a slight bow have become more popular than a full bow. However, bowing is not reserved only for greetings. Bowing is a gesture of respect. Different bows are used for apologies and gratitude. Basic bows originate at the waist and are performed with the back straight and the hands at the sides (for men) or clasped in front (for women), and with the eyes down. Generally, bows can be divided into three main types: informal, formal, and very formal. Informal bows are made at about a fifteen degree angle and more formal bows at about thirty degrees. Very formal bows are deeper. In extreme cases a kneeling bow is performed, which may be so deep that the forehead touches the floor. There is an extremely complex etiquette surrounding bowing, including the length and depth of bow, and the appropriate response. For example, if the other person maintains his or her bow for longer than expected (generally about two or three seconds), it is polite to bow again, upon which one may receive another bow in return, often leading to an exchange of progressively lighter bows. Apology and thanks Bows are a required and expected part of any apology or expression of thanks in East Asia, especially Japan and Korea. Bows of apology tend to be deeper and last longer than other types of bow. They occur with frequency during the apology, generally at about 45-50 degrees with the head lowered and lasting for at least the count of three but sometimes longer. The depth, frequency and duration of the bow increases with the sincerity of the apology and the severity of the offense. Bows of thanks follow the same pattern. Bows of apology are frequently performed at press conferences by high-ranking members of a company that has performed some misdeed, such as producing faulty parts that resulted in a death. The bows are almost invariably performed standing behind a table; the tips of the fingers touch the table while the upper body, held straight, is lowered from the waist until the face is parallel with the tabletop. Greeting Bows are commonly used in greeting, both when meeting and when departing. Bows almost automatically accompany the greeting phrases, but generally are no longer used among the immediate family unless addressing a family member after or in anticipation of a long absence or separation. Bows also replace speaking under certain circumstances. For example, when encountering again a person to whom one has already spoken that day, a silent bow replaces such phrases as \\"hello\\" or \\"hi.\\" When addressing a subordinate, a manager, supervisor, or other leader generally only nods the head slightly (some may not bow at all), while the subordinate bends forward slightly from the waist. Shaking hands When dealing with non-East Asians, many East Asians will shake hands. Since many non-East Asians are familiar with the custom of bowing, this often leads to an awkward combined bow and handshake. Bows may be combined with handshakes or performed before or after shaking hands. Generally when bowing in proximity to another, as necessitated when combining bowing and shaking hands, people turn slightly to one side to avoid bumping heads. In China The kowtow is the highest sign of reverence in Han Chinese culture, but its use has become extremely rare since the collapse of Imperial China. In many situations, the standing bow has replaced the kowtow. However, in modern Chinese societies, bowing is not as formalized as in Japan, South Korea and North Korea. Bowing is normally reserved for occasions such as marriage ceremonies and as a gesture of respect for the deceased, although it still sometimes used for more formal greetings. In China, three bows are customarily executed at funerals including state funerals, ancestral worship, and at special ceremonies in commemoration of pater patriae Sun Yat-sen. As in Japan and Korea, public figures may bow formally to apologize. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao bowed and offered his condolences to stranded railway passengers; Taiwanese Defence Minister Chen Chao-min bowed in apology for a gaffe concerning the shooting of former President Chen Shui-bian in 2004. =In South and Southeast Asia= Steven Gerrard performing a wai Similarly to East Asia, bowing is the traditional form of greeting in many South Asian and Southeast Asian countries. A gesture known as the A√±jali MudrƒÅ is used as a sign of respect and greeting and involves a bow of varying degrees depending on whom one performs it to and hands pressed together generally at chest level. Practised throughout South Asia and Southeast Asia, the gesture is most commonly used in India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Indonesia. Gestures across the region are known by different names such as the wai in Thailand, sampeah in Cambodia and Laos, sembah in Indonesia, namaste in India and Nepal, and in Sri Lanka the gesture is used as a greeting with the word \\"Ayubowan\\". =In martial arts= Judo practitioner (right) performs a bow while seated in seiza. Bowing is an integral part of traditional martial arts. Bows are used to begin and end practice, sparring bouts and competitions, and when entering and leaving the dojo, or practice room. Some martial arts bows are different in terms of the position of the arms and hands. For example, a karate bow is performed with the arms at the sides, while other bows, such as a Silat bow, are performed with the hands together and the hands and the arms in front. =In tea ceremonies= Bowing is an important part of the Japanese tea ceremony. There are three main types of bow performed in tea ceremony; they are classified as shin (Áúü), gy≈ç (Ë°å), and s≈ç (Ëçâ). All are usually performed from a kneeling position. Shin bows are the deepest; from a kneeling position, the bower bends forward from the waist, placing the hands palms down on the floor in front of the body, with the fingers facing. Shin bows are performed to teachers and superiors. Gy≈ç and s≈ç bows respectively are less deep and less long. From a kneeling position and bowing from the waist, the hands are slid over the knees until the tips of the fingers touch the floor in front of the body. They are performed among persons of similar rank. Students of tea ceremony bow to each other and to their teacher; each class begins with bows between the teacher and students. If a senior student is teaching a junior student, bows are exchanged between the two. Before beginning a practice, a student bows to all the other students as well. This pattern is repeated when the practice ends. A bow is performed at the door before entering the tea room, or tea house. One then proceeds to the tokonoma, or scroll alcove, and bows again. Finally one greets the teacher, and then the other students, or the other guests, with bows. This pattern is repeated when leaving the tea room as well. The host of a tea ceremony bows before beginning the ceremony. Bows are exchanged repeatedly throughout a tea ceremony, between the host and guest of honor, among the guests, between guests and the hosts assistants, and between the host and guests. In religious settings =Eastern religions= In many Eastern religions bowing is used as a sign of respect in worship and has its origins in the Indic A√±jali MudrƒÅ. Sikhism Sikhs only bowed to their Gurus, who were the messengers of god. Their holy book, the Guru Granth Sahib is seen as the eternal guru after the death of their living gurus, as it has the word of god written by the past living gurus. In a Gurdwara, Sikhs bow to the Guru Granth Sahib and are not permitted to take part in idol worshiping, bowing to anything other than the Guru Granth Sahib or bowing to any living person. Shintoism Bows are performed in Shinto settings. Visitors to a Shinto shrine will clap or ring a bell to attract the attention of the enshrined deity, clasp the hands in prayer, and then bow. Buddhism Bowing is a common feature for worship in Buddhism. Zen Buddhism, for example, has a daily ritual in which practitioners do 1,080 full prostration bows, usually spread throughout the day. More casual practitioners and laypeople typically do 108 bows once a day instead. Hinduism A young man displays pranama to an elder. In the Hindu traditions people show deference by bowing or kneeling down and touching feet of an elder or respected person. Traditionally, a child is expected to bow down to their parents, teachers and elders during certain formal ceremonies and casual settings. =Judaism= In the Jewish setting, bowing, similar to in Christianity, is a sign of respect, and is done at certain points in Jewish services. By tradition, in the Temple in Jerusalem, kneeling was part of the regular service, but this is not part of a modern Jewish service. Some bows within the current liturgy are simple bows from the waist ‚Äî others (especially during parts of the Amidah) involve bending the knees while saying Baruch (Blessed), bowing from the waist at Atah ([are] you) and then straightening up at Adonai (God). During the concluding Aleinu section of the services, congregants usually bow when they say \\"V'anachnu kor'im u'mishtachavim u'modim,\\" meaning \\"we bend our knees, prostrate, and acknowledge our thanks.\\" Another moment in the service which triggers the bow is during the \\"Bar'chu.\\" Many bow at the mention of \\"Adonai\\" (the Jewish addressing of the Lord) at this and various other parts in the service (most likely if they are to remain standing during that prayer).Hayim H. Donin, To Pray as a Jew, 1980; pages 38-41. Kneeling is retained in modern Orthodox Judaism, but only on the High Holy Days ‚Äî once on each day of Rosh Hashanah (when the Aleinu prayer is recited during the Amidah), and four times on Yom Kippur ‚Äî again, once for Aleinu, and three times during a central portion of the service when the details of the Avodah, the High Priest's service in the Temple are recited. The Talmudic texts as well as writings of Gaonim and Rishonim indicate that total prostration was common among many Jewish communities until some point during the Middle Ages. Members of the Karaite denomination practice full prostrations during prayers. Ashkenazi Jews prostrate during Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur as did Yemenite Jews during the Tachanun part of regular daily Jewish prayer until somewhat recently. Ethiopian Jews traditionally prostrated during a holiday specific to their community known as Sigd. Sigd comes from a root word meaning prostration in Amharic, Aramaic, and Arabic. There is a move among Talmide haRambam, a small modern restorationist group with perspectives on Jewish law similar to that of Dor Daim, to revive prostration as a regular part of daily Jewish worship. = Christianity = Communicants of many Christian denominations bow at the mention of the name of Jesus, while inside of a church and outside of one. The origin of this practice is within Sacred Scripture, which states: \\"Therefore God also highly exalted Him and gave Him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bend, in heaven and on earth and under the earth\\" (NRSV). This pious custom was mandated in the Second Council of Lyon, which proclaimed \\"Whenever that glorious name is recalled, especially during the sacred mysteries of the Mass, everyone should bow the knees of his heart which he can do even by a bow of his head.\\" The eighteenth canon of the Church of England, mother Church of the Anglican Communion, made this external obeisance obligatory during the divine service, declaring: \\"When in time of divine service the Lord JESUS shall be mentioned, due and lowly reverence shall be done by all persons present, as it has been accustomed; testifying by these outward ceremonies and gestures their inward humility, Christian resolution, and due acknowledgement that the Lord JESUS CHRIST, the true eternal Son of God, is the only Saviour of the world, in whom alone all the mercies, graces, and promises of God to mankind for this life, and the life to come, are fully and wholly comprised.\\" Likewise, in the Lutheran Churches, people are \\"to bow when the name of Jesus is mentioned\\", and in the Roman Catholic Church \\"at the mention of the name of Jesus, there is a slight bow of the head\\". John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist Churches, also taught the faithful \\"to bow at the Name of Jesus\\" and as a result, it is customary for Methodists to bow at the mention of His name, especially during the recitation of the Creed. In Christian liturgy, bowing is a sign of respect or deference. In many Christian denominations, individuals will bow when passing in front of the altar, or at certain points in the service (for example, when the name of Jesus Christ is spoken, as mentioned above). It may take the form of a simple bow of the head, or a slight incline of the upper body. A profound bow is a deep bow from the waist, and is often done as a substitution for genuflection. In Eastern Orthodoxy, there are several degrees of bowing, each with a different meaning. Strict rules exist as to which type of a bow should be used at any particular time. The rules are complicated and are not always carried out in all parishes. In the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church, a profound bow, prostration, a slight bow of the head (during the Creed) genuflection, and kneeling are all prescribed in the liturgy at various points. In addition, there are two forms of genuflection, depending on whether or not the Blessed Sacrament is exposed on the altar or not. In addition to bowing at the mention of the name of Jesus, in the Anglican Communion, \\"A reverence in the form of a bow is made to an altar, because it is as it were God's throne, and in a manner represents Him.\\" As with Anglican churches, in Lutheran and Methodist churches, when approaching the chancel, it is customary to bow towards the altar (or altar cross). In Anglican churches a bow is also made when the processional cross passes by a communicant in a church procession. Conservative Protestant Christians such as Brethren, Mennonite, and Seventh- day Adventists make a practice of kneeling during community prayer in the church service. Until the mid-1900s this was common practice among many Protestant Christian groups. According to the New Testament writer Paul, everyone on Earth will someday bow to Jesus Christ. He writes in Philippians 2:9-11, \\"Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.\\" KJV. He is here quoting a similar passage regarding bowing from the Old Testament, Isaiah 45:23. =Islam= Muslim practitioners performing Sajdah or Sujud. In Islam, there are two types of bowing, Sujud and Ruk'u. Sajdah or Sujud is to prostrate oneself to Allah in the direction of the Kaaba at Mecca which is done during daily prayers (salat). While in sujud, a Muslim is to praise Allah and glorify him. The position involves having the forehead, nose, both hands, knees and all toes touching the ground together. Ruku' is bowing down in the standing position during daily prayers (salat). The position of ruku' is established by bending over, putting one's hands on one's knees, and remaining in that position while also praising Allah and glorifying Him. In Islam, it is shirk (major sin) to bow to a human being with the intention to worship, or if that person is considered divine by the bower. Muslims are only supposed to bow, with the intention to worship, to Allah. Moreover, bowing as a greeting or sign of thanks or respect, without an intent to worship, is also classified as shirk (major sin) and forbidden according to a specific hadith in Sunan-at-Tirmidhi.

These films, usually through the use of special effects, display a fascination with the vulnerability of the human body and the theatricality of its mutilation. The term \\"splatter cinema\\" was coined by George A. Romero to describe his film Dawn of the Dead, though Dawn of the Dead is generally considered by critics to have higher aspirations, such as social commentary, than to be simply exploitative for its own sake. During the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the use of graphic violence in cinema has been labeled \\"torture porn\\" or \\"gorno\\" (a portmanteau of \\"gore\\" and \\"porno\\"). By contrast, films such as Braindead, Evil Dead II and to some extent Dawn of the Dead, all of which feature over-the-top gore, can be construed as comedic, and fall into the category of splatstick. Characteristics Splatter films, according to film critic Michael Arnzen, \\"self-consciously revel in the special effects of gore as an artform.\\" Where typical horror films deal with such fears as that of the unknown, the supernatural and the dark, the impetus for fear in a splatter film comes from physical destruction of the body and the pain accompanying it. There is also an emphasis on visuals, style and technique, including hyperactive camerawork. Where most horror films have a tendency to re-establish the social and moral order with good triumphing over evil, splatter films thrive on a lack of order. Arnzen argues that \\"the spectacle of violence replaces any pretensions to narrative structure, because gore is the only part of the film that is reliably consistent.\\" These films also often feature fragmented narratives and direction, including \\"manic montages full of subject camera movement...cross- cuttings from hunted to hunter, and ominous juxtapositions and contrasts.\\" Origins The splatter film has its aesthetic roots in French Grand Guignol theatre, which endeavored to stage realistic scenes of blood and carnage for its patrons. In 1908, Grand Guignol made its first appearance in England, although the gore was downplayed in favor of a more Gothic tone, owing to the greater censorship of the arts in Britain. The first appearance of gore‚Äîthe realistic mutilation of the human body‚Äîin cinema can be traced to D. W. Griffith's Intolerance (1916), which features numerous Guignol-esque touches, including two onscreen decapitations, and a scene in which a spear is slowly driven through a soldier's naked abdomen as blood wells from the wound. Several of Griffith's subsequent films, and those of his contemporary Cecil B. DeMille, featured similarly realistic carnage. =Modern era= In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the public was reintroduced to splatter themes and motifs by groundbreaking films such as Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960) and the output of Hammer Film Productions (an artistic outgrowth of the English Grand Guignol style) such as The Curse of Frankenstein (1957) and Horror of Dracula (1958). Perhaps the most explicitly violent film of this era was Nobuo Nakagawa's Jigoku (1960), which included numerous scenes of flaying and dismemberment in its depiction of the Buddhist underworld Naraka. Splatter came into its own as a distinct subgenre of horror in the early 1960s with the films of Herschell Gordon Lewis in the United States. Eager to maintain a profitable niche, Lewis turned to something that mainstream cinema still rarely featured: scenes of visceral, explicit gore. In 1963, he directed Blood Feast, widely considered the first splatter film. In the 15 years following its release, Blood Feast took in an estimated $7 million. It was made for an estimated $24,500. Blood Feast was followed by two more gore films by Herschell Gordon Lewis, Two Thousand Maniacs! (1964) and Color Me Blood Red (1965). The popularity of the splatter film in the 1970s was met with strong reactions in the US and the U.K. Roger Ebert in the U.S., and Member of Parliament Graham Bright in the U.K., led the charge to censor splatter films on home video with the film critic going after I Spit on Your Grave while the politician sponsored the Video Recordings Act, a system of censorship and certification for home video in the U.K., p.276 This resulted in the outright banning of many splatter films, which were deemed \\"video nasties\\" in the British press. Some splatter directors have gone on to produce mainstream hits. Peter Jackson started his career in New Zealand by directing the splatter movies Bad Taste (1987) and Braindead (1992). These films featured such over-the-top gore that it became a comedic device. These comedic gore films have been dubbed \\"splatstick\\", defined as physical comedy that involves dismemberment. Splatstick seems to be more common in Japan, with the examples of Robogeisha, Tokyo Gore Police, and Machine Girl. The 1980 mockumentary Cannibal Holocaust, an influential example of splatter cinema. Splatter films have pioneered techniques used in other genres. For example, the popular 1999 film The Blair Witch Project is similar to the 1980 film Cannibal Holocaust.Deodato, Ruggero. Interview with Sage Stallone; Bob Murawski. \\"Cult- Con 2000\\", Cannibal Holocaust DVD commentary, Tarrytown, New York. 12 November 2000.

He devoted himself especially to the study of natural science, and increased the naturalistic elements in Aristotle's thought to such an extent, that he denied the need for an active god to construct the universe, preferring to place the government of the universe in the unconscious force of nature alone. Life Strato, son of Arcesilaus or Arcesius, was born at Lampsacus between 340 and 330 BC. He might have known Epicurus during his period of teaching in Lampsacus between 310 and 306. He attended Aristotle's school in Athens, after which he went to Egypt as tutor to Ptolemy, where he also taught Aristarchus of Samos. He returned to Athens after the death of Theophrastus (c. 287 BC), succeeding him as head of the Lyceum. He died sometime between 270 and 268 BC,. Strato devoted himself especially to the study of natural science, whence he obtained the name of Physicus ().Diogenes Laertius, Lives of the Philosophers, ¬ß 5.58 Cicero, while speaking highly of his talents, blames him for neglecting the most important part of philosophy, that which concerns virtue and morals, and giving himself up to the investigation of nature.Cicero, Acad.

Part of a fresco in the National University of Athens. Strato emphasized the need for exact research, and, as an example of this, he made use of the observation of how water pouring from a spout breaks into separate droplets as evidence that falling bodies accelerate.\\"This experiment goes back to a passage in Simplicius' Commentary on the Physics, where it is said that Strato of Lampsacus, had offered this \\"experiment\\" of pouring water from a spout as evidence of the fact that falling bodies are accelerated.\\" Whereas Aristotle defined time as the numbered aspect of motion,Aristotle, Physics, 4.11 219b5 Strato argued that because motion and time are continuous whereas number is discrete, time has an existence independent of motion, or simply that time was the quantitative aspect of motion, rather than its numerical aspect. Simplicius preserves the following quotation in his commentary on Aristotle's Physics: \\"For we say we that we go abroad or sail or go on a military campaign or wage war for much time or for little time, and similarly, that we sit and sleep and do nothing for much time and for little time: for much time in the cases where the quantity is much, for little where it is little. For time is the quantitative in each of these. And this is why some people say that one and the same [thing] came slowly, others quickly, according to how the quantitative in this seems to each group. For we saw that that is quick in which the quantity from when it began to when it stopped is small, but much happened in this [interval]. Slow is the opposite, when the quantity in it is much, but what has been done is little. And for this reason, there is no quick and slow in rest, for all is equal to its own quantity, and neither much in a small quantity, or short in a large one. And this is why we speak of more and less time, but not of quicker or slower time. For an action and a motion can be quicker or slower, but the quantity in which the action is, is not quicker and slower, but more and less, like the time. Day and night, and month and year are not time or parts of time, but the former are light and dark, the latter the circuit of the moon and sun, while time is the quantity in which these are.\\"Strato of Lampascus: Texts, Translation and Discussion; Routledge, 2011, Desclos and Fortenbaugh, eds. pg. 87 He was critical of Aristotle's concept of place as a surrounding surface, preferring to see it as the space which a thing occupies. He also rejected the existence of Aristotle's fifth element. He emphasized the role of pneuma, ('breath' or 'spirit') in the functioning of the soul; soul-activities were explained by pneuma extending throughout the body from the 'ruling part' located in the head. All sensation is felt in the ruling-part of the soul, rather than in the extremities of the body; all sensation involves thought, and there is no thought not derived from sensation. He denied that the soul was immortal, and attacked the 'proofs' put forward by Plato in his Phaedo. Strato believed all matter consisted of tiny particles, but he rejected Democritus' theory of empty space. In Strato's view, void does exist, but only in the empty spaces between imperfectly fitting particles; Space is always filled with some kind of matter. Such a theory permitted phenomena such as compression, and allowed the penetration of light and heat through apparently solid bodies. He seems to have denied the existence of any god outside of the material universe, and to have held that every particle of matter has a plastic and seminal power, but without sensation or intelligence; and that life, sensation, and intellect, are but forms, accidents, and affections of matter. Cicero took exception to this: > Nor does his pupil Strato, who is called the natural philosopher, deserve to > be listened to; he holds that all divine force is resident in nature, which > contains, he says, the principles of birth, increase, and decay, but which > lacks, as we could remind him, all sensation and form.Cicero, De Natura > Deorum, i. 13. Like the atomists (Leucippus and Democritus) before him, Strato of Lampsacus was a materialist and believed that everything in the universe was composed of matter and energy. Strato was one of the first philosophers to formulate a secular worldview, in which God is merely the unconscious force of nature. > You deny that without God there can be anything: but here you yourself seem > to go contrary to Strato of Lampsacus, who concedes to God a pardon from a > great task. If the priests of God were on vacation, it is much more just > that the Gods would also be on vacation; in fact he denies the need to > appreciate the work of the Gods in order to construct the world. All the > things that exist he teaches have been produced by nature; not hence, as he > says, according to that philosophy which claims these things are made of > rough and smooth corpuscles, indented and hooked, the void interfering; > these, he upholds, are dreams of Democritus which are not to be taught but > dreamt. Strato, in fact, investigating the individual parts of the world, > teaches that all that which is or is produced, is or has been produced, by > weight and motion. Thus he liberates God from a big job and me from > fear.Cicero, Lucullus, 121. quoted in Strato endeavoured to replace the Aristotelian teleology by a purely physical explanation of phenomena, the underlying elements of which he found in heat and cold, with especially heat as the active principle. Although Strato's view of the universe can be seen as secular, he may have accepted the existence of gods within the universe, in the context of ancient Greek religion; it is unlikely that he would have regarded himself as an atheist. Geology As quoted from Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology: > Strabo passes on to the hypothesis of Strato, the natural philosopher, who > had observed that the quantity of mud brought down by rivers into the Euxine > was so great, that its bed must be gradually raised, while the rivers still > continued to pour in an undiminished quantity of water. He therefore > conceived that, originally, when the Euxine was an inland sea, its level had > by this means become so much elevated that it burst its barrier near > Byzantium, and formed a communication with the Propontis, and this partial > drainage had already, he supposed, converted the left side into marshy > ground, and that, at last, the whole would be choked up with soil. So, it > was argued, the Mediterranean had once opened a passage for itself by the > Columns of Hercules into the Atlantic, and perhaps the abundance of sea- > shells in Africa, near the Temple of Jupiter Ammon, might also be the > deposit of some former inland sea, which had at length forced a passage and > escaped.Charles Lyell, Principles of Geology, 1832, p.20-21 Also following the reference of Georgius Agricola Strato of Lampsacus, the successor of Theophrastus, wrote a book on the subject of metallic arts called De Machinis Metallicis.Georgius Agricola, De Re Metallica, from English traduction written by Herbert Clark Hoover and Lou Henry Hoover, p. xxvi Modern influence Strato's name meant little in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. However, in the 17th century, his name suddenly became famous due to the supposed similarities between his system and the pantheistic views of Spinoza. In his 1678 attack on atheism, Ralph Cudworth designated Strato's system as one of four types of atheism and in doing so, coined the term hylozoism to describe any system where primitive matter is endowed with a life force. These ideas reached Pierre Bayle, who adopted Strato and 'Stratonism' as key components of his own philosophy. In his Continuation des Pens√©es diverses, published in 1705, Stratonism became the most important ancient equivalent of Spinozism. For Bayle, Strato had made everything to follow a fixed order of necessity, with no innate good or bad in the universe; the universe was not regarded as a living thing with intelligence or intent, and there is no other divine power but nature.

The expression is a political neologism dating from the 1980s and implies a degree of hypocrisy. The dictionary Petit Larousse defines left caviar as a pejorative expression for a \\"Progressivism combined with a taste for society life and its accoutrements\\".http://www.larousse.fr : under Caviar: Gauche caviar, gauche dont le progressisme s'allie au go√ªt des mondanit√©s et des situations acquises One description referred to it as \\"the free-thinking, authority-hating, individualistic, tolerant, socialist position... which shaded into a bohemian, existential, communitarian, fairly depressed\\" worldview espoused by people with money and good clothes. The concept is broadly similar to the English Champagne socialist, the American Limousine liberal or latte liberal, the German Salonkommunist, the Dutch salonsocialist, the Italian Radical chic, the Portuguese esquerda caviar, the Chilean Spanish red set, and the Danish Kystbanesocialist, referring to well-off coastal neighborhoods north of Copenhagen. Other similar terms in English include Hampstead liberal, liberal elite, chardonnay socialist, smoked salmon socialist, and Bollinger Bolshevik.  Usage  The term was once prevalent in Parisian circles, applied deprecatingly to those who professed allegiance to the Socialist Party, but who maintained a far from proletarian lifestyle that distinguished them from the working-class base of the French Socialist Party. A more explicit reference identified this group as left-wingers who speak great passion about the plight of the poor while eating caviar in their spectacular Parisian duplex apartment. The label was also employed by detractors to describe Fran√ßois Mitterrand. This was further reinforced by the fact that several members of his administration were identified as part of the gauche caviar such as Jack Lang, who was the culture minister. In early 2007, S√©gol√®ne Royal was identified with the gauche caviar when it was revealed that she had been avoiding paying taxes. The description damaged her campaign for the French presidency. Similarly French politician Bernard Kouchner and his wife Christine Ockrent have been labelled with the term. However, his appointment as Minister of Foreign Affairs was not hampered by the label. Other supposed members of this gauche caviar include Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former IMF managing director, and his wife, the journalist Anne Sinclair, heiress to much of the fortune of her maternal grandfather, the art dealer Paul Rosenberg. It is said that around 2015, the gauche caviar supported also the Greek government of SYRIZA and PM Tsipras, \\"desperate for a new 'anti- imperialist hero' after Hugo Chavez's death\\".Cas Mudde, \\"SYRIZA: The Failure of the Populist Promise\\", Springer, 2016, p. 16, 23 Similarly, Emmanuel Macron has been accused by opponents of being the archetype of this label, claiming a socialist background while implementing right wing policies. Since the beginning of his term, these accusations have contributed to a growth in his unpopularity. The weekly news magazine, Le Nouvel Observateur, has been described as the \\"quasi-official organ of France's 'gauche caviar'\\". Regardless of whether gauche caviar is accepted by those given such label, politicians who fit this classification wield power in the French polity. For instance, during the administration of Mitterrand, a number of policies were adopted to avoid offending this group, which included the Gais pour la liberte (Gays for freedom).

In 2002 he won the third Australian Popstars TV talent competition. His debut solo album, Controlled Folly (October 2002), peaked in the ARIA Albums Chart top 50\\\\. Its lead single, \\"I'm Moving On\\" (May 2002), reached number one on the related ARIA Singles Chart. While competing on Popstars, the Final 7 contestants released a compilation single with each providing a cover version of Stevie Wonder's \\"Superstition\\", which peaked at number seven. His wife, Danielle Stearman, was a fellow contestant on Popstars, the couple have two children together.  Biography  Scott Cain was born on 2 April 1981 and grew up in Port Macquarie. He attended Port Macquarie Primary School ‚Äì where he was school captain in his final year ‚Äì and then Port Macquarie High School where he completed Year 10. He also competed as a skateboarder. By 2000 Cain was living in Perth where he worked as a furniture polisher and was also lead vocalist in a band, Funkapation. They released an album, Peanut Butter Brick, in 2000 and competed in the Hastings Valley Battle of the Bands earning Cain the award for Best Vocalist. Late in 2001 Cain auditioned for the Australian TV talent competition, Popstars third season. In March 2002 he entered the ARIA Singles Chart with his version of Stevie Wonder's \\"Superstition\\", which was featured on a Popstars 3 The Final 7 compilation single ‚Äì each contestant provided their own version of the track. It peaked at number seven and was certified gold for shipment of 35,000 copies by the end of the year. His first solo single, after winning the competition, was \\"I'm Moving On\\", which debuted at number one in May and was also certified gold. Despite protest from Cain, his label, Warner Music Australasia, released his second single as \\"Crazy People Rock\\", which peaked at number 39. Both of his initial singles were written by Gregg Alexander of the New Radicals. Cain had intended to release \\"Perfect Day\\", co-written by himself with Nick Howard, Note: User may have to click 'Search again' and provide details at 'Enter a title:' e.g Perfect Day; or at 'Performer:' Scott Cain as his second solo single but he was prevented by Warner. His debut album, Controlled Folly, reached number 49\\\\. He also released the non-album single \\"Oceans in Between\\", a song based upon the events of 11 September 2001. This was a collaboration with Vents limited to 1,000 copies and released only through his website. Scott also performed this song at various charity events. In 2003, he began hosting the AMTV show on the Disney Channel, and released the song \\"Step into My World\\" on a Roadshow compilation. He won Best New Talent at the 2004 ASTRA awards, beating out other finalists including James Mathieson and Andrew G ~ a public vote saw Scott Cain again win the public support for his role on AMTV Disney Channel take him home the award. The following year, Cain signed with ABC Kids and released his second album, Roller Coaster (October 2004). \\"Perfect Day\\" appeared on this album. Another album track, \\"Hilary Duff\\", received radio airplay and later that year Cain supported the subject of the song, Hilary Duff, on her national Australian tour.  Personal life  In 2002 Scott Cain started dating a fellow Popstars contestant, Danielle Stearman. Stearman also provided her version of \\"Superstition\\" for the compilation single and finished second in the contest. Stearman, as Danielle, released a solo single, \\"Tell Me if You Like It\\" (July 2002), which reached number 20 on the ARIA Singles chart. Cain and Stearman featured in a music video for the Australian band, The Millionaires, on their track, \\"Wrong Guy\\", which Stearman co-wrote with their lead singer, Jordan Cade. Cain and Stearman issued a duet album, Spero, in 2009. In 2011, they got engaged and had a son. In 2015, they were married in Las Vegas and in 2017 had a daughter.

It works as an insulin sensitizer, by binding to the PPAR in fat cells and making the cells more responsive to insulin. It is marketed by the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) as a stand-alone drug or for use in combination with metformin or with glimepiride. First released in 1999, annual sales peaked at approximately $2.5-billion in 2006; however, following a meta-analysis in 2007 that linked the drug's use to an increased risk of heart attack, sales plummeted to just $9.5-million in 2012. The drug's patent expired in 2012. It was patented in 1987 and approved for medical use in 1999. Despite rosiglitazone's effectiveness at decreasing blood sugar in type 2 diabetes mellitus, its use decreased dramatically as studies showed apparent associations with increased risks of heart attacks and death. Adverse effects alleged to be caused by rosiglitazone were the subject of over 13,000 lawsuits against GSK; as of July 2010, GSK had agreed to settlements on more than 11,500 of these suits. Some reviewers recommended rosiglitazone be taken off the market, but an FDA panel disagreed, and it remains available in the U.S. From November 2011 until November 2013, the federal government did not allow Avandia to be sold without a prescription from a certified doctor; moreover, patients were required to be informed of the risks associated with its use, and the drug had to be purchased by mail order through specified pharmacies. In 2013, the FDA lifted its earlier restrictions on rosiglitazone after reviewing the results of a 2009 trial which failed to show increased heart attack risk. In Europe, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended in September 2010 that the drug be suspended because the benefits no longer outweighed the risks. It was withdrawn from the market in the UK, Spain and India in 2010, and in New Zealand and South Africa in 2011. Medical uses Rosiglitazone was approved for glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes, as measured by glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) as a surrogate endpoint, similar to that of other oral antidiabetic drugs. The controversy over adverse effects has dramatically reduced the use of rosiglitazone. Published studies did not provide evidence that outcomes like mortality, morbidity, adverse effects, costs and health-related quality of life are positively influenced by rosiglitazone.  Adverse effects  =Heart failure= One of the safety concerns identified before approval was fluid retention. Moreover, the combination of rosiglitazone with insulin resulted in a higher rate of congestive heart failure. In Europe there were contraindications for use in heart failure and combination with insulin. A meta analysis of all trials from 2010 and 2019 confirmed a higher risk of heart failure and a double risk when rosiglitazone was administered as add-on therapy to insulin. Two meta-analyses of real life cohort studies found a higher risk of heart failure compared to pioglitazone. There were 649 excess cases of heart failure every 100,000 patients who received rosiglitazone rather than pioglitazone. =Heart attacks= The relative risk of ischemic cardiac events seen in pre-approval trials of rosiglitazone was similar to that of comparable drugs, but there was increased LDL cholesterol, LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio, triglycerides and weight. In 2005, at the insistence of the World Health Organization, GSK performed a meta-analysis of all 37 trials involving use of rosiglitazone, finding a hazard ratio of 1.29 (0.99 to 1.89). In 2006 the GSK updated the analysis, now including 42 trials and showing a hazard ratio of 1.31 (1.01 to 1.70). A large observational study comparing patients treated with rosiglitizone with patients treated with other diabetes therapies was performed at the same time and found a relative risk of 0.93 (95% C.I. 0.8 to 1.1) for those treated with rosiglitazone. The information was passed to the FDA and posted on the company website, but not otherwise published. GSK provided these analyses to the FDA, but neither the company nor the FDA warned prescribers or patients of the hazard. According to the FDA, the Agency did not issue a safety bulletin because the results of the meta analysis conflicted with those of the observational study and with the results of the ADOPT trial. A meta-analysis in May 2007 reported the use of rosiglitazone was associated with a 1.4 fold increased risk of heart attack and a numerically higher (but non-significant) increase in risk of death from all cardiovascular diseases against control. It contained 42 trials of which 27 were unpublished. Another meta analysis of 4 trials with follow-up longer than 1 year found similar results. Nissen's meta analysis was criticized in a 2007 article by George Diamond et al in the Annals of Internal Medicine. The authors concluded that Nissens' analysis had excluded trials with important data on the cardiovascular profile of rosiglitazone, had inappropriately combined trials of greatly differing design, and had inappropriately excluded trials with no cardiovascular events. The authors concluded that no firm conclusion could be drawn regarding whether rosiglitazone increased or decreased cardiovascular risk. Investigators from the Cochrane Collaboration published a meta-analysis of their own on the use of rosiglitazone in Type II diabetes, concluding there was not sufficient evidence to show any health benefit for rosiglitazone. Noting the recent publication by Nissen, they repeated their meta analysis including only the trials included in the Nissen study that dealt with Type II diabetics. (The Nissen study included some trials in people with other disorders.) They did not find a statistically significant increase in cardiovascular events, but noted that all of the cardiovascular endpoints they analyzed showed a non-significant trend toward worse outcomes in the rosiglitazone arms. In July 2007 the FDA held a joint meeting of the Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee and the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee. FDA scientist Joy Mele presented a meta analysis examining the cardiovascular risk of rosiglitazone in completed clinical trials. The study found an overall 1.4x increase in risk of cardiovascular ischemic events relative to the control arms. The results were heterogenous, with clear evidence of increased risk relative to placebo but not relative to other diabetes treatments and higher risk associated with combinations of rosiglitazone with insulin or metformin. Based on the 1.4x increased risk relative to control groups, FDA scientist David Graham presented an analysis suggesting that rosiglitazone had caused 83,000 excess heart attacks between 1999 and 2007.\\"Staff report on GlaxoSmithKline and the diabetes drug Avandia\\", Committee on Finance, United States Senate, January 2010.David Graham, \\"Assessment of the cardiovascular risks and health benefits of rosiglitazone\\", Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology, Food and Drug Administration, 30 July 2007. The advisory panel voted 20 : 3 that the evidence available indicated that rosiglitazone increased the risk of cardiovascular events and 22 : 1 that the overall risk:benefit ratio of rosiglitazone justified its continued marketing in the United States. The FDA placed restrictions on the drug, including adding a boxed warning about heart attacks, but did not withdraw it.\\"FDA Adds Boxed Warning for Heart-related Risks to Anti-Diabetes Drug Avandia. Agency says drug to remain on market, while safety assessment continues\\", Food and Drug Administration, 14 November 2007. In 2000 a study to address the concerns regarding cardiovascular safety was requested by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). GSK agreed to perform post-marketing a long-term cardiovascular morbidity/mortality study in patients on rosiglitazone in combination with a sulfonylurea or metformin: the RECORD study. The results as published in 2009 showed that rosiglitazone was non-inferior to treatment with metformin or a sulfonylurea with respect to the rate of cardiovascular events and cardiovascular death. European regulators concluded that due in part to design limitations, the results neither proved nor eliminated concerns of excess cardiovascular risk. In February 2010, the FDA's associate director of drug safety, recommended rosiglitazone be taken off the market. In June 2010, they published a retrospective study comparing roziglitazone to pioglitazone, the other thiazolidinedione marketed in the United States and concluded rosiglitazone was associated with \\"an increased risk of stroke, heart failure, and all-cause mortality and an increased risk of the composite of AMI, stroke, heart failure, or all-cause mortality in patients 65 years or older\\". The number needed to harm with roziglitazone was sixty. Graham argued rosiglitazone caused 500 more heart attacks and 300 more heart failures than its main competitor. Two meta analyses released in 2010, one incorporating 56 trials and a second incorporating 164 trials reached conflicting conclusions. Nissen et al. found again an increased risk for heart infarction against control, but no increased risk for cardiovascular death. Mannucci et al. found no statistically significant increase in cardiac events but a significant increase in heart failure. A 2011 drug class review found an increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events. A meta-analysis of 16 observational studies released in March, 2011, compared rosiglitazone to pioglitazone, finding support for greater cardiovascular safety for pioglitazone. The meta-analysis involved 810 000 patients taking rosiglitazone or pioglitazone. The study suggests 170 excess myocardial infarctions, 649 excess cases of heart failure, and 431 excess deaths for every 100 000 patients who receive rosiglitazone rather than pioglitazone. This was confirmed by another meta-analysis involving 945 286 patients in 8 retrospective cohort studies, most in the US. In 2012, the U.S. Justice Department announced GlaxoSmithKline had agreed to plead guilty and pay a $3 billion fine, in part for withholding the results of two studies of the cardiovascular safety of Avandia between 2001 and 2007. =Death= There was no difference in all cause and vascular death in a meta-analysis of 4 trials against controls. Two meta-analyses of cohort studies found excess deaths against pioglitazone. =Stroke= An retrospective observational study performed using Medicare data found that patients treated with rosiglitazone had a 27% higher risk of stroke compared to those treated with pioglitazone. =Bone fractures= GlaxoSmithKline reported a greater incidence of fractures of the upper arms, hands and feet in female diabetics given rosiglitazone compared with those given metformin or glyburide.Cobitz, Alexander R (February 2007). . GlaxoSmithKline. Retrieved on 10 April 2007. The information was based on data from the ADOPT trial The same increase has been found with pioglitazone (Actos), another thiazolidinedione. A meta-analysis of 10 RCTs, involving 13,715 patients and including both rosiglitazone- and pioglitazone- treated patients, showed an overall 45% increased risk of fracture with thiazolidone use compared with placebo or active comparator. It doubled the risk of fractures among women with type 2 diabetes, without a significant increase in risk of fractures among men with type 2 diabetes. =Hypoglycaemia= The risk of hypoglycaemia is reduced with thiazolidinediones when compared with sulfonylureas; the risk is similar to the risk with metformin (high strength of evidence). =Weight gain= Both thiazolidinediones cause a similar degree of weight gain to that caused by sulfonylureas (moderate strength of evidence). =Eye damage= Both rosiglitazone and pioglitazone have been suspected of causing macular edema, which damages the retina of the eye and causes partial blindness. Blindness is also a possible effect of diabetes, which rosiglitazone is intended to treat. One report documented several occurrences and recommended discontinuation at the first sign of vision problems. A retrospective cohort study showed an association between the use of thiazolidinediones and the incidence of diabetic macular edema (DME). Both use was associated with a 2,3 higher risk at 1 year and at 10 year follow-up, rising to 3 if associated with insulin. =Hepatotoxicity= Moderate to severe acute hepatitis has occurred in several adults who had been taking the drug at the recommended dose for two to four weeks. Plasma rosiglitazone concentrations may be increased in people with existing liver problems.R. Baselt, Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man, 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 1399-1400. =Contraindications= Both rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are contraindicated in people with NYHA Class III and IV heart failure. They are not recommended for use inheart failure. In Europe rosiglitazone was contraindicated for heart failure or history of heart failure with regard to all NYHA stages, for combined use with insulin and for acute coronary syndrome. The European Medicines Agency recommended on 23 September 2010 that Avandia be suspended from the European market. Pharmacology Two Avandia 2 mg oral tablets Rosiglitazone is a member of the thiazolidinedione class of drugs. Thiazolidinediones act as insulin sensitizers. They reduce glucose, fatty acid, and insulin blood concentrations. They work by binding to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). PPARs are transcription factors that reside in the nucleus and become activated by ligands such as thiazolidinediones. Thiazolidinediones enter the cell, bind to the nuclear receptors, and alter the expression of genes. The several PPARs include PPARŒ±, PPARŒ≤/Œ¥, and PPARŒ≥. Thiazolidinediones bind to PPARŒ≥. PPARs are expressed in fat cells, cells of the liver, muscle, heart, and inner wall (endothelium) and smooth muscle of blood vessels. PPARŒ≥ is expressed mainly in fat tissue, where it regulates genes involved in fat cell (adipocyte) differentiation, fatty acid uptake and storage, and glucose uptake. It is also found in pancreatic beta cells, vascular endothelium, and macrophages Rosiglitazone is a selective ligand of PPARŒ≥ and has no PPARŒ±-binding action. Other drugs bind to PPARŒ±. Rosiglitazone also appears to have an anti-inflammatory effect in addition to its effect on insulin resistance. Nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-Œ∫B), a signaling molecule, stimulates the inflammatory pathways. NF-Œ∫B inhibitor (IŒ∫B) downregulates the inflammatory pathways. When patients take rosiglitazone, NF- Œ∫B levels fall and IŒ∫B levels increase. History Rosiglitazone was approved by the US FDA in 1999 and by the EMA in 2000; the EMA however required two postmarketing studies on longterm adverse effects, one for chronic heart failure and the other for cardiovascular effects. Society and culture =Sales= US sales of the drug were of $2.2 billion in 2006. Sales in 2Q 2007 down 22% compared to 2006. 4Q 2007 sales down to $252 million. Though sales have gone down since 2007 due to safety concerns, Avandia sales for 2009 totalled $1.2 billion worldwide. =Lawsuits= According to analysts from UBS, 13,000 suits had been filed by March 2010. Included among those suing: Santa Clara County, California, which claims to have spent $2 million on rosiglitazone between 1999 and 2007 at its public hospital and is asking for \\"triple damages\\". In May 2010, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) reached settlement agreements for some of the cases against the company, agreeing to pay $60 million to resolve 700 suits. In July 2010, GSK reached settlement agreements to close another 10,000 of the lawsuits against it, agreeing to pay about $460 million to settle these suits. In 2012, the U.S. Justice Department announced GlaxoSmithKline had agreed to plead guilty and pay a $3 billion fine, in part for withholding the results of two studies of the cardiovascular safety of Avandia between 2001 and 2007. The settlement stems from claims made by four employees of GlaxoSmithKline, including a former senior marketing development manager for the company and a regional vice president, who tipped off the government about a range of improper practices from the late 1990s to the mid-2000s. United States investigations GlaxoSmithKline was being investigated by the FDA and the US Congress regarding Avandia. Senators Democrat Max Baucus and Republican Charles Grassley filed a report urging GSK to withdraw Avandia in 2008 due to the side effects. The report noted the drug caused 500 avoidable heart attacks a month, and Glaxo officials sought to intimidate doctors who criticized the drug. It also said GSK continued to sell and promote the drug despite knowing the increased risk of heart attacks and stroke. The Senate Finance Committee, in a panel investigation, revealed emails from GSK company officials that suggest the company downplayed scientific findings about safety risks dating back to 2000. It was also alleged by the committee that the company initiated a \\"ghostwriting campaign\\", whereby GSK sought outside companies to write positive articles about Avandia to submit to medical journals. GSK defended itself by presenting data that its own tests found Avandia to be safe, although an FDA staff report showed the conclusions were flawed. On July 14, 2010, after two days of extensive deliberations, the FDA panel investigating Avandia came to a mixed vote. Twelve members of the panel voted to take the drug off the market, 17 recommended to leave it on but with a more revised warning label, and three voted to keep it on the market with the current warning label. The panel has come to some controversy, however; on July 20, 2010, one of the panelists was discovered to have been a paid speaker for GlaxoSmithKline, arousing questions of a conflict of interest. This panel member was one of the three who voted to keep Avandia on the market with no additional warning labels. In 2011 the FDA has decided on revising its prescribing information and medication guides for all rosilitazone containing medicines. The US label for rosiglitazone (Avandia, GlaxoSmithKline) and all rosiglitazone-containing medications (Avandamet and Avandaryl) now include the additional safety information and restrictions. The revised labels restrict use to patients already taking a rosiglitazone-containing medicine or to new patients who are unable to achieve adequate glycemic control on other diabetes medications and to those, who in consultation with their healthcare provider, have decided not to take Actos (pioglitazone) or other pioglitazone-containing medicines for medical reasons. In June 2013 an FDA Advisory Committee reviewed all available data, including a re-adjudicated RECORD trial, found no evidence of increased cardiovascular risk with Avandia, and voted to remove the restrictions on Avandia marketing in the United States. In November 2013, the US FDA removed these marketing restrictions on the product. Under the FDA‚Äôs instruction, Avandia‚Äôs maker, GlaxoSmithKline, had funded the Duke Clinical Research Institute to re-analyze the raw data from the study. At the 2010 panel, three panelists voted that the existing warnings were good enough; two were back in 2013. Seven voted to make those warnings more onerous, and five of them returned. But of the 10 who voted to restrict Avandia‚Äôs use, only four returned. And of the 12 who voted in 2010 to withdraw Avandia from the market, only three came back. European investigations In 2000 a study to address the concerns regarding cardiovascular safety was requested by the EMA, and the makers agreed to perform post-marketing a long-term cardiovascular morbidity/mortality study in patients on rosiglitazone in combination with a sulfonylurea or metformin: the RECORD study. The results as published in 2009 showed non-inferiority with regard to cardiovascular events and cardiovascular death when the treatment with rosiglitazone was compared with metformin or a sulfonylurea. For myocardial infarction, there was a non-statistically significant increase in risk. In their assessment, the European regulators acknowledged weaknesses of the study, such as an unexpectedly low rate of cardiovascular events and the open-label design, which may lead to reporting bias. They found that the results were inconclusive. The European Medicines Agency recommended on 23 September 2010 that Avandia be suspended from the European market. According to a probe by the British Medical Journal in September 2010, the United Kingdom's Commission on Human Medicines recommended to the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) back in July 2010, to withdraw Avandia sale because its \\"risks outweigh its benefits\\". Additionally, the probe revealed that in 2000, members of the European panel in charge of reviewing Avandia prior to its approval had concerns about the long-term risks of the drug. New Zealand  Rosiglitazone was withdrawn from the New Zealand market April 2011 because Medsafe concluded the suspected cardiovascular risks of the medicine for patients with type 2 diabetes outweigh its benefits. South Africa A notice issued by the Medicines Control Council of South Africa on July 5, 2011 stated that it had resolved on July 3, 2011 to withdraw all rosiglitazone-containing medicines from the South African market due to safety risks. It disallowed all new prescriptions of Avandia. =Controversy and response= Following the reports in 2007 that Avandia can significantly increase the risk of heart attacks, the drug has been controversial. A 2010 article in Time uses the Avandia case as evidence of a broken FDA regulatory system that \\"may prove criminal as well as fatal\\". It details the disclosure failures, adding, \\"Congressional reports revealed that GSK sat on early evidence of the heart risks of its drug, and that the FDA knew of the dangers months before it informed the public.\\" It reports, \\"the FDA is investigating whether GSK broke the law by failing to fully inform the agency of Avandia's heart risks\\", according to deputy FDA commissioner Dr. Joshua Sharfstein. GSK threatened academics who reported adverse research results, and received multiple warning letters from the FDA for deceptive marketing and failure to report clinical data. The maker of the drug, GlaxoSmithKline, has dealt with serious backlash against the company for the drug's controversy. Sales on the drug dropped significantly after the story first broke in 2007, dropping from $2.5 billion in 2006 to less than $408 million in 2009 in the US. In response to the rise in risk of heart attacks, the Indian government ordered GSK to suspend its research study, called TIDE, in 2010. The FDA also halted the TIDE study in the United States. Three doctors' groups, the Endocrine Society, the American Diabetes Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, urged patients to continue to take the drug as it would be much worse to stop all treatment, despite any associated risk, but that patients could consult their doctors and begin a switch to a different drug if they or their doctors find concern. The American Heart Association said in a statement in June 2010: \\" ...the reports deserves serious consideration, and patients with diabetes who are 65 years of age or older and being treated with rosiglitazone should discuss the findings with their prescribing physician....\\". \\"For patients with diabetes, the most serious consequences are heart disease and stroke, and the risk of suffering from them is significantly increased when diabetes is present. As in most situations, patients should not change or stop medications without consulting their healthcare provider.\\" As a result of the Avandia Affair, FDA required that cardiac safety be demonstrated for new drugs to treat type 2 diabetes. This process is described by Dr Robert Misbin in INSULIN-History from an FDA Insider, published June 1, 2020 on Amazon. Dr Misbin was the first FDA reviewer for rosiglitazone (Avandia) and cautioned about its potential to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Research Rosiglitazone was thought to be able to benefit patients with Alzheimer's disease who do not express the ApoE4 allele, but the phase III trial designed to test this showed that rosiglitazone was ineffective in all patients, including ApoE4-negative patients. Rosiglitazone may also treat mild to moderate ulcerative colitis, due to its anti-inflammatory properties as a PPAR ligand. Synthesis Rosiglitazone synthesis:2¬∞ Source: The Art of Drug Synthesis.

It is a very broad generalisation of conjectures such as the twin prime conjecture named after Andrzej Schinzel. Statement The hypothesis aims to define the possible scope of a conjecture of the nature that several sequences of the type : f(n), g(n), \\\\ldots, with values at integers n of irreducible integer-valued polynomials : f(x), g(x), \\\\ldots, should be able to take on prime number values simultaneously, for arbitrarily large integers n. Putting it another way, there should be infinitely many such n for which each of the sequence values are prime numbers. Some constraints are needed on the polynomials. Schinzel's hypothesis builds on the earlier Bunyakovsky conjecture, for a single polynomial, and on the Hardy‚ÄìLittlewood conjectures and Dickson's conjecture for multiple linear polynomials. It is in turn extended by the Bateman‚ÄìHorn conjecture. Note that the coefficients of the polynomials need not to be integers; for example, this conjecture includes the polynomial \\\\frac{1}{2}x^2+\\\\frac{1}{2}x+1, since it is an integer-valued polynomial. Necessary limitations Such a conjecture requires necessary conditions. For example, if we take the two polynomials x + 4 and x + 7 , there is no n > 0 for which n + 4 and n + 7 are both primes. That is because one of them will be an even number n > 2 . The main question in formulating the conjecture is to rule out this phenomenon. Thus, we should add a condition: \\"For every prime p, there is an n such that all the polynomial values at n are not divisible by p\\". Fixed divisors The arithmetic nature of the most evident necessary conditions can be understood. An integer-valued polynomial Q(x) has a fixed divisor m if there is an integer m > 1 such that :\\\\frac{Q(x)}{m} is also an integer-valued polynomial. For example, we can say that : (x+4)(x+7) has 2 as fixed divisor. Such fixed divisors must be ruled out of : Q(x) = \\\\prod_{i=1}^k f_i(x) for any conjecture for polynomials f_i , i = 1, \\\\ldots, k , since their presence is quickly seen to contradict the possibility that f_i(n) can all be prime, with large values of n . Formulation of hypothesis H Therefore, the standard form of Schinzel's hypothesis H is that if Q defined as above has no fixed prime divisor, then all f_i(n) will be simultaneously prime, infinitely often, for any choice of irreducible integral polynomials f_i(x) with positive leading coefficients. As proved by Schinzel and Sierpi≈Ñski in page 188 of it is equivalent to the following: if Q defined as above has no fixed prime divisor, then there exists at least one positive integer n such that all f_i(n) will be simultaneously prime, for any choice of irreducible integral polynomials f_i(x) with positive leading coefficients. If the leading coefficients were negative, we could expect negative prime values; this is a harmless restriction. There is probably no real reason to restrict to integral polynomials, rather than integer-valued polynomials. The condition of having no fixed prime divisor is certainly effectively checkable in a given case, since there is an explicit basis for the integer-valued polynomials. As a simple example, : x^2 + 1 has no fixed prime divisor. We therefore expect that there are infinitely many primes : n^2 + 1 This has not been proved, though. It was one of Landau's conjectures and goes back to Euler, who observed in a letter to Goldbach in 1752 that n^2 + 1 is often prime for n up to 1500. Previous results The special case of a single linear polynomial is Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions, one of the most important results of number theory. In fact, this special case is the only known instance of Schinzel's Hypothesis H. We do not know the hypothesis to hold for any given polynomial of degree greater than 1 , nor for any system of more than one polynomial. To get a sense of how hard the hypothesis is, note that in the very small special case f_1(t)=t, f_2(t)=t+2 , the hypothesis implies the existence of infinitely many twin primes, a basic and notorious open problem. Almost prime approximations to Schinzel's Hypothesis have been attempted by many mathematicians; among them, most notably, Chen's theorem states that there exist infinitely numbers n such that n+2 is either a prime or a semiprime and Henryk Iwaniec proved that there exist infinitely many integers n for which n^2+1 is either a prime or a semiprime . Alexei Skorobogatov and Efthymios Sofos have proved that almost all polynomials of any fixed degree satisfy Schinzel's hypothesis H. . Prospects and applications The hypothesis is probably not accessible with current methods in analytic number theory, but is now quite often used to prove conditional results, for example in Diophantine geometry. This connection is due to Jean- Louis Colliot-Th√©l√®ne and Jean-Jacques Sansuc . For further explanations and references on this connection see the notes of Peter Swinnerton-Dyer. The conjectural result being so strong in nature, it is possible that it could be shown to be too much to expect. Extension to include the Goldbach conjecture The hypothesis doesn't cover Goldbach's conjecture, but a closely related version (hypothesis HN) does. That requires an extra polynomial F(x) , which in the Goldbach problem would just be x , for which :N ‚àí F(n) is required to be a prime number, also. This is cited in Halberstam and Richert, Sieve Methods. The conjecture here takes the form of a statement when N is sufficiently large, and subject to the condition :Q(n)(N ‚àí F(n)) has no fixed divisor > 1\\\\. Then we should be able to require the existence of n such that N ‚àí F(n) is both positive and a prime number; and with all the fi(n) prime numbers. Not many cases of these conjectures are known; but there is a detailed quantitative theory (Bateman‚ÄìHorn conjecture). Local analysis The condition of having no fixed prime divisor is purely local (depending just on primes, that is). In other words, a finite set of irreducible integer-valued polynomials with no local obstruction to taking infinitely many prime values is conjectured to take infinitely many prime values. An analogue that fails The analogous conjecture with the integers replaced by the one- variable polynomial ring over a finite field is false. For example, Swan noted in 1962 (for reasons unrelated to Hypothesis H) that the polynomial ::x^8 + u^3\\\\, over the ring F2[u] is irreducible and has no fixed prime polynomial divisor (after all, its values at x = 0 and x = 1 are relatively prime polynomials) but all of its values as x runs over F2[u] are composite. Similar examples can be found with F2 replaced by any finite field; the obstructions in a proper formulation of Hypothesis H over F[u], where F is a finite field, are no longer just local but a new global obstruction occurs with no classical parallel, assuming hypothesis H is in fact correct.

Its cells are embryologically and biologically similar to the endothelial cells that line blood vessels. The endocardium also provides protection to the valves and heart chambers. The endocardium underlies the much more voluminous myocardium, the muscular tissue responsible for the contraction of the heart. The outer layer of the heart is termed epicardium and the heart is surrounded by a small amount of fluid enclosed by a fibrous sac called the pericardium. Function Histology of the endocardium and subendocardium. The endocardium, which is primarily made up of endothelial cells, controls myocardial function. This modulating role is separate from the homeometric and heterometric regulatory mechanisms that control myocardial contractility. Moreover, the endothelium of the myocardial (heart muscle) capillaries, which is also closely appositioned to the cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells), is involved in this modulatory role. Thus, the cardiac endothelium (both the endocardial endothelium and the endothelium of the myocardial capillaries) controls the development of the heart in the embryo as well as in the adult, for example during hypertrophy. Additionally, the contractility and electrophysiological environment of the cardiomyocyte are regulated by the cardiac endothelium. The endocardial endothelium may also act as a kind of blood‚Äìheart barrier (analogous to the blood‚Äìbrain barrier), thus controlling the ionic composition of the extracellular fluid in which the cardiomyocytes bathe. Clinical significance In myocardial infarction, ischemia of the myocardium can extend to the endocardium, disrupting the inner lining of the heart (\\"transmural\\" infarction). Less extensive infarctions are often \\"subendocardial\\" and do not affect the epicardium. In the acute setting, subendocardial infarctions are more dangerous than transmural infarctions because they create an area of dead tissue surrounded by a boundary region of damaged myocytes. This damaged region will conduct impulses more slowly, resulting in irregular rhythms. The damaged region may enlarge or extend and become more life-threatening. In the chronic setting, transmural infarctions are more dangerous due to the greater amount of muscular damage and the development of scar tissue leading to impaired systolic contractility, impaired diastolic relaxation, and increased risk for rupture and thrombus formation. During depolarization the impulse is carried from endocardium to epicardium, and during repolarization the impulse moves from epicardium to endocardium. In infective endocarditis, the endocardium (especially the endocardium lining the heart valves) is affected by bacteria.

She also fronted a disco act called Sheila and B. Devotion. Her stage name came from the title of her first release, a French cover version of \\"Sheila\\", a hit by Tommy Roe. Career Sheila started her musical career in 1962, after being noticed by Claude Carr√®re, a French record producer and songwriter. Her parents signed a contract with Carr√®re for her, when she was 16; the contract led to an artistic collaboration which lasted for more than 20 years. In 1995, a lawsuit put an end to this life-time deal. She entered into along a royalties battle against her former producer, which she won. Sheila had numerous hits in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, playing the typical 'girl next door'. Her first hit was \\"L'√©cole est finie\\" (\\"School is over\\"), in 1962 (1 million copies). It reached the #1 position in France. In the movie, Eight Women, Ludivine Sagnier sang her 1963 hit \\"Papa t'es plus dans l'coup\\" (\\"Daddy, you are not in on it anymore\\"). Sheila's music also featured in the 1996 Fran√ßois Ozon film Une robe d'√©t√© (A Summer Dress). The character S√©bastien is a fan of Sheila, and Sheila's version of Cher's \\"Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)\\" was on the soundtrack. \\"Les rois mages\\" also featured in \\"Ma vie en rose\\", a 1997 gender- bender film, \\"Love me baby\\", in 1978, \\"Attention les enfants regardent\\", with Alain Delon, \\"Spacer\\" in \\"Podium\\" (2004). After more than a decade of targeting the French teen music audience, mainly in French but also in Spanish, German and Italian, Sheila made a change in her career by releasing \\"Les Femmes (Qu'y a-t-il dans le c≈ìur des femmes)\\", a song by Christine Charbonneau in 1976. \\"Les Femmes\\" climbed to number one and stayed in the chart for three months. \\"Les Femmes\\" brought to Sheila a revolution of modernity, making her one of the idols of the French pop music. In 1977, she started singing in English as Sheila and B. Devotion (in some countries records were under the name \\"Sheila B. Devotion\\") and changed her style to disco music. Sheila was accompanied by three male dancers who made up the \\"Black Devotion\\" in her routine. She enjoyed international success with hits such as \\"Singin' in the Rain\\", \\"Love Me Baby\\", \\"You Light my Fire\\" and \\"Spacer\\" (from the album King of the World, produced by Chic). \\"Spacer\\" is one of her biggest hits with more than 5 million copies sold worldwide. According to different interviews, she often said her experience with Chic completely changed her way of working and singing. It was the beginning of a deep artistic disagreement with her French manager Carr√®re, which made Sheila leave France, move to New York \\"to start all over again\\" and studied at the Actors Studio. After her disco period, in 1981, Sheila (without the \\"B. Devotion\\" gimmick) recorded the rock album Little Darlin', produced by Keith Olsen, and was back in the U.S. Billboard chart. The title song became her only U.S. Billboard Hot 100 hit, reaching #49 in early 1982. She put an end to her artistic collaboration with her manager Carr√®re at the beginning of the 1980s, then took a brand new musical direction in 1983 when she met Yves Martin, a composer and producer who later became her husband. She recorded three albums under his direction between 1983 and 1988, and her new songs were critically acclaimed. Becoming disillusioned with the music business and record industry, she abandoned her music career between 1989 and 1998. During this break, she wrote three successful books, had her own regular TV show, played in a TV series and started making sculptures. However Sheila had a successful comeback in music in 1998 with a new CD compiling re-recordings of some of her hits, along with new songs. It went gold within one month. Thanks to this unexpected success, another studio album called Dense was released a year later with brand new songs. Sheila is still widely popular today, performing concerts in 1998 and 2002 at the Olympia, in 2006 at the Cabaret Sauvage with an unplugged concert or on tour with \\"La Tourn√©e des Idoles\\" in 2009 and 2010. In 2005 she signed a deal with Warner Music France after many years of negotiation. All of her recordings, including her self-produced albums, can now be released on CD under the same label. Following this agreement, her complete recordings were issued in an 18 CD box set in 2006. It included more than 400 songs, unknown recordings, demos, alternative takes, duets, TV performances and German, Italian, Spanish and English versions of her hits. In 2007, Warner Music France decided to release separately each of her albums on CD with its original artwork and bonus tracks. Most of them are also re-issued on vinyl LP format. Her album Little Darlin' was remastered and released in Japan in January 2011 on SHM-CD. This reissue is the replica of the original LP with its Japanese cover. The pictures and artwork are completely different from other international pressings. It also contains the title \\"Prisoner\\" as on the first Japanese release in 1981 (it remained unknown on other markets until 1996). She was one of the contestants during the Second season of Danse avec les stars (Dancing with the Stars). Sheila celebrated her 50 years in the music industry with a show at the Paris Olympia music hall in September 2012. A brand new album \\"Solide\\" with 10 new songs was released in November 2012. In February 2013 she received a \\"Victoire de la Musique\\" award celebrating her 50-year career anniversary. Late 2019, Sheila took part to the French port of the famous Masked Singer TV franchise, under the Squirrel costume. She was eliminated in the second episode, and unmasked to overall surprise since none of the show's panelists guessed her successfully. Personal life She married French singer Guy Bayle known by the name Ringo or Ringo Willy Cat on 13 February 1973.

The company develops and distributes software for planning, designing, building and managing buildings and real estate, as well as for media and entertainment.  History  The company was founded by Prof. Georg Nemetschek in 1963 and went by the name of Ingenieurb√ºro f√ºr das Bauwesen (engineering firm for the construction industry), focusing on structural design. The engineering firm was one of the first companies in the industry to use computers and developed software for engineers, initially for its own requirements. In 1977 Nemetschek started distributing its program system Statik 97/77 for civil engineering. At the Hanover Fair in 1980, Nemetschek presented a software package for the integrated calculation and design of standard components for solid construction. This was the first time that it was possible to use Computer-aided engineering (CAE) on microcomputers, and the product remained unique on the market for many years. Nemetschek AG headquarters in Munich In 1981 Nemetschek Programmsystem GmbH was founded and was responsible for software distribution; Georg Nemetschek's engineering firm continued to be in charge of program development. The main product, Allplan ‚Äì a CAD system for architects and engineers, was launched in 1984. This allowed designers to model buildings in three dimensions. Nemetschek began to expand internationally in the 80s: by 1996 the company had subsidiaries in eight European countries and distribution partners in nine countries in Europe, and since 1992 has also had an additional development site in Bratislava, Slovakia. The first acquisitions were made at the end of the 90s, e.g. the structural design program vendor Friedrich + Lochner. The company, operating as Nemetschek AG since 1994, went public in 1999 and has been listed in the Prime Standard market segment and the TecDAX in Frankfurt ever since. A series of company takeovers were to follow, the largest acquisitions including the American Diehl Graphsoft (now Vectorworks) and MAXON Computer GmbH with its Cinema 4D software for visualization and animation. The next major takeovers occurred in 2006 with the purchases of the Hungarian Graphisoft with its key product ArchiCAD and the Belgian SCIA International. In November 2013 Nemetschek acquired the MEP software provider Data Design System (DDS).Corporate News: Nemetschek successfully concludes acquisition of Data Design System (DDS) On 31 October 2014 the acquisition of Bluebeam Software, Inc. was concluded.Nemetschek successfully concludes acquisition of Bluebeam Software At the end of 2015 Solibri was acquired. Since 2016, the company is operating as Nemetschek SE. Later that year SDS/2 was acquired. dRofus and RISA became members of the Nemetschek Group in 2017. MCS Solutions was acquired in 2018 and later rebranded 'Spacewell'. Currently, the Nemetschek Group consists of 16 brands which are located along the whole building lifecycle - from planning to operating a building. In the last years, further acquisitions were completed on brand level, such as Redshift Rendering Technologies or Red Giant who both were acquired by Maxon. Since Sept. 18, 2018, Nemetschek is listed in the MDAX in addition to its TecDAX listing. Among others, Nemetschek is a member of the BuildingSMART e.V. and the Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Nachhaltiges Bauen (DGNB) (German Sustainable Building Council), actively advocating for open Building Information Modeling (BIM) standards (\\"open BIM\\") in the AEC/O industry.  Business units  Since 2008, Nemetschek AG has acted as a holding company with four business units: Planning & Design (Architecture and Civil Engineering), Build & Construct, Manage & Operate as well as Media & Entertainment.

He was a major contributor to two popular magazines and a friend to influential cultural icons like Samuel Johnson and Henry Fielding. Smart, a high church Anglican, was widely known throughout London.Mounsey 2001 p. 281 Smart was infamous as the pseudonymous midwife \\"Mrs. Mary Midnight\\" and widespread accounts of his father-in-law, John Newbery, locking him away in a mental asylum for many years over Smart's supposed religious \\"mania\\". Even after Smart's eventual release, a negative reputation continued to pursue him as he was known for incurring more debt than he could repay; this ultimately led to his confinement in debtors' prison until his death. Smart's two most widely known works are A Song to David and Jubilate Agno, both at least partly written during his confinement in asylum. However, Jubilate Agno was not published until 1939 and A Song to David received mixed reviews until the 19th century. To his contemporaries, Smart was known mainly for his many contributions in the journals The Midwife and The Student, along with his famous Seaton Prize poems and his mock epic The Hilliad. Although he is primarily recognised as a religious poet, his poetry includes various other themes, such as his theories on nature and his promotion of English nationalism. Biography =Early life= Christopher Smart was born in Shipbourne in Kent, England on the Fairlawne estate of William, Viscount Vane, younger son of Lord Barnard of Barnard Castle.Mounsey p. 22 He was, according to his nephew, \\"of a delicate constitution having been born earlier than the natural period\\".Hunter p. vi He was baptised in Wrotham parish on 11 May 1722. Smart's father was Peter Smart, stewardSherbo p. 4 or bailiff of Fairlawne. His mother, Winifred (n√©e Griffiths) was from Radnorshire, Wales.Sherbo p. 5 Before giving birth to Christopher, Winifred had two daughters, Margaret and Mary Anne. During Smart's younger years, Fairlawne was the residence of Christopher Vane, 1st Baron Barnard and Lady Barnard, who bequeathed ¬£200 to Smart.Sherbo p. 6 He supposedly received this sum due to his father's closeness to the Vane family, his being named after Christopher Vane, and the young boy being considered \\"the pride of Fairlawn\\".Mounsey p. 27 In 1726, three years after Christopher Vane died, Peter Smart purchased Hall-Place in East Barming, which included a mansion house, fields, orchards, gardens, and woodland, a property that was influential throughout Smart's later life. From the age of four until eleven, he spent much time around the farms, but did not participate, leading to speculation that he suffered from asthma attacks.Mounsey p. 29 However, not all scholars agree that he was a \\"sickly youth\\".Sherbo p. 12 The only written record of events during his childhood comes from his writing of a short poem, at the age of four, in which he challenges a rival to the affections of a twelve-year-old girl. While at Hall- Place, Smart was sent to the local Maidstone Grammar School where he was taught by Charles Walwyn, a scholar from Eton College who had received an MA from King's College, Cambridge in 1696.Sherbo p. 9 It was here that Smart received an intensive education in Latin and Greek. He did not complete his education at Maidstone however, as his father died on 3 February 1733, and his mother took Smart and his siblings to live near relatives in Durham after selling off a large portion of the estate to pay off Peter Smart's debts.Sherbo p. 19 Smart then attended Durham School, where the Reverend Mr. Richard Dongworth was headmaster; it is not known whether he lived with his uncle, John Smart, or with a school master.Sherbo p. 13 He spent vacations at Raby Castle, which was owned by Henry Vane, 1st Earl of Darlington, the grandson of Christopher Vane.Sherbo p. 16 Henry Vane and his wife Grace, sister to William and Henrietta Fitzroy the Duke and Duchess of Cleveland, had four children, Henry, Frederick, Anne, and Mary. They were only a few years younger than Smart and became playmates, with Anne and Henry \\"pairing off\\" with Christopher and his sister Margaret respectively. Although nothing resulted from the match, Anne has been traditionally described as being his \\"first love\\".Sherbo p. 17 During his time with the Vane family, Smart dedicated many poems to Henrietta, the Duchess of Cleveland.Mounsey p. 40 It was his closeness with the Vane family along with his skill for learning that encouraged Henrietta to allow him a pension of 40 pounds yearly, continued by her husband after her death in 1742. This allowed Smart to attend Pembroke College, Cambridge.Sherbo p. 22 =College= Christopher Smart's Pembroke portrait showing a letter sent from Alexander Pope Smart was admitted to Pembroke College on 20 October 1739 as a sizar under Leonard Addison.Sherbo p. 24 Although it is unclear why he chose Pembroke College, Addison was named in Peter Smart's trust deed (1729).Mounsey p. 43 As a sizar, he occasionally had to wait on the \\"Fellows' table\\" and perform other menial tasks.Sherbo p. 25 On 12 July 1740, he was awarded the \\"Dr. Watt's Foundation scholarship\\", which granted him six pounds a year until he gained a Bachelor of Arts degree.Sherbo p. 26 In addition to this income, he was also granted four pounds a year for scholarship.Mounsey p. 48 Although he was successful academically, he began to run up debt in order to pay for his extravagant lifestyle while at the college. During his time at Pembroke, Smart borrowed numerous books spanning the fields of literature, religion, and science.Mounsey p. 44 These works helped when he wrote the three \\"Tripos Verse\\" at the end of each year.Mounsey p. 47 These poems were written in Latin and they, along with his other Latin poems like his translation of Alexander Pope's Ode on St. Cecilia's Day, led to him being awarded the Craven scholarship for classics on 10 June 1742, which paid ¬£25 a year for 14 years.Mounsey p. 49 These scholarships, combined with his becoming a fellow in 1743, justified Smart calling himself \\"Scholar of the University\\".Sherbo p. 31 In 1743, Smart pushed his translation of Pope's Ode on St. Cecilia's Day as Carmen Cl. Alexandri Pope in S. Caeciliam Latine Redditum and paid for the publication himself.Mounsey p. 50 With this translation, he wanted to win Pope's favour and translate Pope's Essay on Man, but Pope rejected the idea and, after a lettered response and a possible meeting between the two, Smart translated Pope's An Essay on Criticism (De Arte Critica) instead. The initial letter sent from Pope recommending the future translation was prized by Smart.Sherbo p. 33 In response to this letter and his budding relationship with Pope, the Pembroke Fellows honoured him with a portrait showing him holding the letter from Pope and allowed him to write a poem in celebration of Jubilee of Pembroke's 400th year in 1744.Mounsey p. 51 In October 1745, Smart was elected Praelector of Philosophy, which paid one pound a year, and made one of three Keepers of the Common Chest.Sherbo p. 36 The next year, on 11 February 1746, he became a Master of Arts and was later elected on 10 October 1746, to Praelector of Philosophy, Praelector of Rhetoric, and Keeper of the Common Chest.Sherbo p. 42 However, he had run up more debt of over twice his annual income, and he was not re-elected in 1747 to the Praelectorship and was denied his control over the Common Chest accounts.Sherbo p. 44‚Äì45 However, he was made a \\"Preacher before the Mayor of Cambridge\\" at the college under the title \\"Concionatori Coram Praetore oppidano\\", and his modest living during this year allowed him to regain Praelectorship in Philosophy along with being made a catechist, which suggests that he was ordained in the Anglican church.Sherbo p. 45 In 1746, Smart became tutor to John Hussey Delaval, but this was abruptly cancelled because Delaval was removed from Pembroke after a variation of broken rules and mischief.Mounsey p. 54‚Äì55 After recovering from this, Smart returned to studying. In April 1747, a comedy he wrote just months before, A Trip to Cambridge, or The Grateful Fair, was performed in Pembroke College Hall, with many parts, including female roles, played by Smart himself.Sherbo p. 53‚Äì54 The prologue was printed in The Cambridge Journal Weekly Flying-Post, which claimed that the play received \\"Universal Applause\\".Sherbo p. 54 During his final years at Pembroke, Smart was writing and publishing many poems.Sherbo p. 50 On 9 January 1748, there were three proposals for \\"A Collection of Original Poems, By Christopher Smart, M.A., Fellow of Pembroke Hall, in the University of Cambridge\\" that would include \\"The Hop Garden\\", \\"The Judgment of Midas, a Masque\\", his odes, his translations into Latin, and some original Latin poems.Sherbo p. 51 Thomas Gray, on 17 March 1747, referred to this work as Smart's \\"Collection of Odes\\". This collection was not printed in 1748 but was delayed until 1752, and was re-titled Poems on Several Occasions. Between 1740 and 1746, he was introduced to Harriot Pratt, and he began to write poetry about her.Sherbo p. 46 By 1749, he was in love with her and wrote to his friend Charles Burney (father of Fanny Burney), \\"I am situated within a mile of my Harriote & Love has robd Friendship of her just dues ... There was a great musical crash at Cambridge, which was greatly admired, but I was not there, being much better pleased with hearing my Harriote on her spinnet & organ at her ancient mansion\\", suggesting that he was living permanently in Market Downham, London.Sherbo p. 48 Although he wrote many poems dedicated to Harriot, his poem \\"The Lass with the Golden Locks\\" (1752) claims that he was done with both Harriot, Polly, and other women.Sherbo p. 49 The \\"lass with the golden locks\\" who replaced Smart's previous fancies was Anna Maria Carnan.Poetical Works iv p. xxiii Anna would be Smart's future wife and she was the stepdaughter of John Newbery, Smart's future publisher.Sherbo p. 87 =London= Although Smart seemed to turn his life around at Pembroke, he slowly abandoned the college for London. During 1749, Smart listed himself on Pembroke's \\"Liber Absentiae\\" and would occasionally return to Pembroke throughout 1749 and 1750.Sherbo p. 57 Because of his relationship with those at Pembroke, he was allowed to keep his name in the college's records, which allowed him to participate and be charged as a member of the college. By 1750 he was living near St. James's Park and was busy familiarising himself with Grub Street.Sherbo p. 58‚Äì59 It was this year that Smart developed a business relationship with John Newbery.Sherbo p. 59 Smart worked for Newbery and married his stepdaughter in 1752. It is unknown how Smart and Newbery met, but Smart's daughter claimed Charles Burney introduced the two.Sherbo p. 62 Newbery was looking for a contributory to his The Midwife and The Student magazines, and it is possible that Smart's winning of Cambridge's \\"Seatonian Prize\\" on 25 March 1750 brought his poetic abilities to Newbery's attention. The \\"Seatonian Prize\\" was a contest for one English poem each year on the topic of \\"the Perfections or Attributes of the Supreme Being\\" and the prize would be the \\"Rent of the [Kislingbury, Northamptonshire] estate\\" It was established by the will of Thomas Seaton, an \\"Anglican divine and hymn writer\\".Curry p. 7 Smart wrote in the \\"poetical essay\\" tradition using Miltonic blank verse. In 1750, the poem he won the prize with was On the Eternity of the Supreme Being. The prize was only worth 17 pounds each year before 7 pounds were deducted for the publication of the poem.Sherbo p. 67 However, after the publication of the poem, Smart became a regular contributor in The Student.Sherbo p. 68 The Student, before Smart's work, was a serious magazine that included a few poems and critical essays. However, once he joined and began writing under many pseudonyms, the magazine became filled with satire, parody, and humorous essays and poems. Along with him composing 15 of the essays and the majority of the poems published in the two volumes of the magazine, he decided to append three of The Inspector, a \\"humorous news report\\", to the second of the volumes.Sherbo p. 69 These reports included many \\"puff pieces\\" promoting Smart's works along with various stories written by his friends and associates, including the famous writers/poets Henry Fielding, Samuel Johnson, William Collins, and Tobias Smollett. However, this was not the only important publication produced by him during this time. During his time in London, Smart's work included Mother Midnight's Oratory, a series of \\"wild tavern entertainments\\" to which Smart acted as writer and performer. =The Midwife= Title page of The Midwife The Midwife, first published on 16 October 1751 and lasting until April 1753, was produced primarily by Smart while he worked on The Student.Sherbo p. 70 This magazine was popular enough to be published in four editions.Mounsey p. 99 To hide his identity for practical and humorous reasons, he adopted the persona of a midwife, also known as a \\"Mrs. Midwife\\" in slang, and called this persona \\"Mrs. Mary Midnight\\". When his poem \\"Night Piece\\" was attacked by William Kenrick in Kapelion, or Poetical Ordinary, possibly out of a prearranged publicity stunt, Smart used The Midwife in December, 1750, to attack back at Kenrick and promised an Old Woman's Dunciad to be written against the other poet.Sherbo p. 72 However, Kenrick beat Smart to the use of the title and printed his own in January, 1751. This feud lasted as attacks published in a few issues of The Midwife, but it soon died out when Smart focused his attention to writing a prologue and epilogue for a production of Othello and using the magazine to promote it.Sherbo p. 73 His attention slowly shifted away from The Midwife when he wrote for, and won, the \\"Seatonian Prize\\" for his On the Immensity of the Supreme Being and when he began working with Newbery's children's magazine, The Lilliputian Magazine.Sherbo p. 74‚Äì75 However, Smart returned to this character full force when he established The Old Woman's Oratory; or Henley in Petticoats in December 1751.Sherbo p. 75 The Oratory included Smart playing as Mrs. Midnight, various songs and dances, animal acts, and \\"miscellany\\" acts.Mounsey p. 119 The Oratory was successful, and was completely redone on 21 January 1752.Mounsey p. 128 However, not everyone enjoyed the show, and Horace Walpole described the performance as \\"the lowest buffoonery in the world even to me who am used to my uncle Horace.\\"Sherbo p. 80 Late in 1752, Smart finished and published a collection of his works as Poems on Several Occasions, which resulted in the end of the Oratory and The Midwife.Mounsey p. 130‚Äì131 =Later career= Illustration of The Hop-Garden In 1752, Christopher Smart was slowly dragged into a large \\"paper war\\" that involved many of London's writers.Mounsey p. 131‚Äì132 After the publication of Poems on Several Occasions, including The Hop-Garden, in June 1752, John Hill launched a major attack upon Smart's poetry.Mounsey p. 131 Smart responded with his mock-epic, The Hilliad.Mounsey p. 134 Before the release of Smart's poem, Hill was engaged in a large literary battle between various members of Grub Street's and London's writing community, especially Henry Fielding.Bertelsen p. 135 This battle may have been for publicity only and lasted over many months before Smart involved himself.Bertelsen p. 143 However, even with such a late entry, his Hilliad was the \\"loudest broadside\\" of the war.Bertelsen p. 144 Smart was incurring many debts, and started publishing as much as possible during this time to support his family; he was married to Anna Maria Carnan around mid-1752, and in 1754 already had two daughters, Marianne (3 May 1753) and Elizabeth Anne (27 October 1754).Sherbo p. 100 As a married man, he could no longer stay enrolled at Pembroke and collect his scholarship money when his marriage and children were made apparent to the heads of the college. Newbery allowed Smart, along with his wife and their children, to live at Canonbury House, Islington. Although Newbery had a strong reputation for charity, he was determined to have complete control over his writers.Mounsey p. 149 It is likely that such an attitude combined with monetary problems led to a rift forming between the two in 1753.Mounsey p. 157 Between 1753 and 1755, Smart published or republished at least 79 works.Mahony and Rizzo However, even if he received money from each of these publications, these publications were unable to provide enough of an income to support a family, especially to his standard of living.Mounsey p. 159 While he was producing a poem each year for the Seatonian Prize, this amounted to very little of his writing; he was forced into a life of \\"hack work\\", which was described by his contemporary, Arthur Murphy, as \\"a bookseller is his only friend, but for that bookseller, however liberal, he must toil and drudge.\\"Mounsey p. 167 In December 1755, he finished The Works of Horace, Translated Literally into English Prose, a translation of Horace, which was widely used but brought him little profit.Sherbo p. 102 He signed a 99-year contract in November 1755 to produce a weekly paper entitled The Universal Visitor or Monthly Memorialist for Thomas Gardner and Edmund Allen.Sherbo p. 104 However, the strain of publishing caused Smart to suffer from a fit, and he was unable to keep up with the publishing of the paper.Sherbo p. 105 Allen was a friend of Samuel Johnson, and it was Samuel Johnson, along with many other friends of Smart, who contributed to the magazine in order to help Smart keep up with his contract. In March 1756, Newbery published without Smart's authority Smart's final \\"Seatonian Prize\\" poem, On the Goodness of the Supreme Being, and later, on 5 June, Newbery published without Smart's authority Smart's Hymn to the Supreme Being, a poem which thanked God for recovery over an illness of some kind, possibly a \\"disturbed mental state\\".Curry p. 5 The Hymn to the Supreme Being marks the time in Smart's life after the mysterious \\"fit\\" was resolved and the beginning of Smart's obsession with religion and his praying \\"without ceasing\\".Curry p. 6‚Äì7 =Asylum confinement= A caricature of Christopher Smart in Tommy Tagg's book published by John Newbery A \\"Commission of Lunacy\\" was taken out against Smart, and he was admitted to St Luke's Hospital for Lunatics on 6 May 1757 as a \\"Curable Patient\\".Sherbo p. 112 It is possible that Smart was confined by Newbery over old debts and a poor relationship between the two; Newbery had previously mocked Smart and his immorality in his A Collection of Pretty Poems for the Amusement of Children six Foot High.Mounsey p. 181 Regardless of the exact reasons, there is evidence suggesting that Newbery's admittance of Smart into the mental asylum was not based on \\"madness\\".Mounsey p. 200 However, there is also evidence that an incident of some kind took place in St. James's Park in which Smart started to pray loudly in public until he had \\"routed all the company\\" (Jubilate Agno B89). It is not known what exactly happened during his confinement, but Smart did work on two of his most famous poems, Jubilate Agno and A Song to David.Mounsey p. 202 What is known is that he may have been in a private madhouse before St Luke's and that he was later moved from St Luke's to Mr. Potter's asylum until his release.Mounsey p. 203 At St Luke's, he transitioned from being \\"curable\\" to \\"incurable\\", and was moved to Mr. Potter's asylum for monetary reasons.Mounsey p. 203‚Äì204 During this time, Anna left and took the children with her to Ireland.Sherbo p. 135 His isolation led him into writing religious poetry, although he abandoned the traditional genres of the 18th century that marked his earlier poetry when he wrote Jubilate Agno.Guest p. 123 Although it is debated as to whether his turning inward to examine himself in his poetry represents an evangelical type of Christianity, his poetry during his isolation does show a desire for \\"unmediated revelation\\".Hawes p. 140 There is an \\"inner light\\" that serves as a focal point for Smart and his poems written during this time, and that inner light connects him to the Christian God.Hawes p. 141 Smart was left alone, except for his cat Jeoffrey and the occasional gawker.Sherbo p. 130 It is very possible that he felt \\"homeless\\" during this time and surely felt that he was in a \\"limbo ... between public and private space\\".Hawes p. 155 In London, only a few of his works were still being published.Mounsey p. 238 However, not everyone viewed Smart's \\"madness\\" as problematic, and Johnson defended him, sometimes seriously and sometimes comically, many times.Keymer p. 190 A century later, Robert Browning later remarked that A Song to David was great because Smart was mad, and that the poem allowed him to rank alongside of Milton and Keats.Jacobs p. 193 It is no wonder that a few of his loyal friends did come to Mr. Potter's and freed him. He was discharged from St. Luke's asylum uncured after one year. He was thought to be confined elsewhere for the following seven years, during which time he wrote Jubilate Agno. Elizabeth, his daughter, claimed: \\"He grew better, and some misjudging friends who misconstrued Mr Newbery's great kindness in placing him under necessary & salutary restriction which might possibly have eventually wrought a cure, invited him to dinner and he returned to his confinement no more.\\"Mounsey p. 239 Although this may be a misstatement of the events, Smart did leave the asylum on 30 January 1763.Mounsey p. 240 =Final years= A Song to David was printed on 6 April 1763 along with a proposal for a new translation of the Psalms.Mounsey p. 247‚Äì248 It is said that Smart composed the poem during his second period of confinement to an asylum during an episode of religious mania The poem was received harshly, which was possibly just thinly veiled personal attacks over Smart being freed from the asylum just weeks before.Mounsey p. 249 However, Kenrick, Smart's former rival, praised the poem in one of his own printed on 25 May 1763.Mounsey p. 250 Also, John Lockman followed on 21 June 1763, with his own poem in praise of Smart's and Samuel Boyce followed this on 15 July 1763 with another.Mounsey p. 252 Along with this support, Smart responded to his critics at the Critical Review; in regards to Smart's response, the Critical Review claimed that they would \\"say no more of Mr. Smart\\".Mounsey p. 257 After A Song to David, he tried to publish a collection of his Psalms translations, and Newbery sought to ruin him by hiring James Merrick to produce his own translations.Mounsey p. 260 Newbery then hired Smart's new publisher, James Fletcher, which in turn forced Smart to find a new publisher, delaying the printing of his Psalms.Mounsey p. 261 Finally, on 12 August 1765, he printed A Translation of the Psalms of David, which included Hymns and Spiritual Songs and a second edition of A Song to David.Poetical Works III p. xiii This work was criticised by Tobias Smollett who was working with Newbery at the time, and Newbery's edition by Merrick was constantly compared with Smart's.Mounsey p. 267 However, modern criticism has received Smart's version in a more favourable light.Davie p. 828 While working on this project, he was also working on a translation of the Phaedrus and a verse translation of Horace.Mounsey p. 268 His verse Horace was published in July 1767 including a preface in which he attacked Newbery, but the attack was in vain because Newbery died soon after.Mounsey p. 269 On 20 April 1770, Smart was arrested for debt.Mounsey p. 271 On 11 January 1771, he was tried by Lord Mansfield, the gentleman who originally introduced Smart to Alexander Pope, and he was soon recommended to the King's Bench Prison.Mounsey p. 272 Although he was in prison, Charles Burney purchased the \\"Rules\\" (allowing him some freedom), and Smart's final weeks may have been peaceful although pathetic.Rizzo p. 515 In his final letter, Smart begged for money from Rev. Mr. Jackson, saying: \\"Being upon recovery from a fit of illness, and having nothing to eat, I beg you to send me two or three shillings which (God willing) I will return, with many thanks, in two or three days.\\"Dearnley p. 11 On 20 May 1771, Smart died from either liver failure or pneumonia shortly after completing his final work, Hymns, for the Amusement of Children. =Death= In response to his uncle's death, Christopher Hunter wrote, \\"I trust he is now at peace; it was not his portion here.\\"Curry qtd. p. 103 Fanny Burney, in her journal, wrote: On 22 May 1771, a jury of twelve fellow inmates of the King's Bench Prison declared that Smart \\"upon the Twentieth day of May Instant died a Natural Death within the Rules of the Prison.\\" He was buried on 26 May in St Paul's Covent Garden. Literary themes and styles Christopher Smart received occasional mentions by critics and scholars after his death, especially by Robert Browning, but analysis and commentary on his works increased dramatically with the \\"discovery\\" of Jubilate Agno in 1939.Poetical Works I p. xxii Many recent critics approach Smart from a religious perspective (Neil Curry, Harriet Guest, Clement Hawes, Chris Mounsey). However, some also favour a psychology/sexual analysis of his works (Lance Bertelsen, Clemet Hawes, Alan Liu). =Religion= A page from the \\"Let\\" side of the Jubilate Agno manuscript A page from the \\"For\\" side of the Jubilate Agno manuscript Although Smart wrote the \\"Seatonian Prize\\" poems early on, there is a contrast between the mimicked Miltonic blank verse and the intense exploration of religion found in his later works.Guest p. 70 His first \\"Seatonian Prize\\" poem, On the Eternity of the Supreme Being is part of two traditional types of religious writing: \\"authoritative discourse of religious poetry\\" and \\"tentative and self-critical discourse of an apparently more personal devotion\\"Guest p. 71 In connecting the two, he redefines \\"the role of the religious poet.\\" By establishing a debate between these two forms, Harriet Guest claims that Smart creates \\"a poetic space which allows the poet to make provisional, even questionable statements\\", which are important to his later works.Guest p. 83 To Guest, Smart, in his religious poems, \\"is not concerned to offer instruction in Christian conduct.\\"Guest p. 94 Besides the greater theological debate, the poems also are the origins of Smart's belief that all of creation is constantly praising God, and that a poet must \\"give voice to mute nature's praise of God.\\"Curry p. 8 Jubilate Agno reflects an abandonment of traditional poetic structures in order to explore complex religious thought.Guest p. 132 His \\"Let\\" verses join creation together as he seemingly writes his own version of Biblical poetry.Guest p. 140 Smart, in Jubilate Agno, plays on words and the meaning behind words in order to participate with the divine that exists within language.Guest p. 167 Although the original manuscript divided the \\"Let\\" and \\"For\\" verses onto opposing sides of the manuscript, Karina Williams claims that \\"Dr W. H. Bond then discovered that some of the LET and FOR folios were numbered and dated concurrently, and that these chronologically parallel texts were further connected by verbal links.\\"Prose Works I p. xxii This justified her combining the two sides to follow each other. Using this as a model, Guest claims that the \\"For\\" verses explore religion with a \\"personal tone\\" and the \\"Let\\" are \\"unambiguous\\" and deal with public matters.Guest p. 141‚Äì142 Jeanne Walker goes further than Guest and claims that the \\"Let \\" and \\"For\\" sections are united with the Hebrew tradition and \\"iterate both present and future simultaneously, that is, they redeem time.\\"Walker p. 458 Words and language connect the poet to divine revelation, and God is the \\"great poet\\" who used language in order to create the universe.Curry p. 28 Through words and language, Smart attempted to capture the creative power of those words.Hawes p. 140‚Äì141 By relying on the power of words, Smart is, according to Clement Hawes, subverting \\"Anglican control over religious functions and services.\\"Hawes p. 152 In essence, Smart's approach to religion in Jubilate Agno is comparable to John Wesley's theological dictum and to the writings of John Perro and William Bowling.Hawes p. 163 He also creates his own natural philosophy and criticises science, like that established by Isaac Newton, for their ignoring \\"the glory of Almighty God.\\"Guest p. 201 To Smart, each piece of matter is alive because it is connected to God, and matter cannot be described in a cold manner that disconnects it from this reality.Guest p. 214 However, Smart accomplished his new science by relying on Newtonian empiricism.Mounsey p. 221 As part of his desire to bring back the divine language to poetry and science, he creates an \\"Ark of Salvation\\" in order to describe a prophetic and apocalyptic future which emphasises the importance of Christ and England.Prose Works I p. xxv Along with being prophetic, the poem itself is modelled after the canticles and follows the form of the Benedicite. The Benedicite is not the only model however, and there is a strong link between Jubilate Agno and the psalm tradition.Walker p. 450 Smart's A Song to David is an attempt to bridge poetry written by humans and Biblical poetry.Guest p. 246 The Biblical David plays an important role in this poem just as he played an important role in Jubilate AgnoHawes p. 167 However, David in Jubilate Agno is an image of the creative power of poetry whereas he becomes a fully realised model of the religious poet. By focusing on David, Smart is able to tap into the \\"heavenly language.\\"Jacobs p. 189 Many critics have focused on the role of David as planner of Solomon's Temple and his possible role with the Freemasons.Curry p. 57 However, the true life of the poem comes later when Christ is introduced as the major subject. After Christ is introduced, Smart attempts to \\"reach to heaven\\" and the final passages, to Neil Curry, represent a \\"final rush for glory.\\"Curry p. 69 According to Mounsey, A Song to David and Smart's Psalms is an attempt to \\"Christianize\\" the Old Testament through writing an 18th-century psalter.Mounsey p. 213 However, the Psalms perform a secondary function: they allow Smart to relate to the suffering of David and to reinforce his own religious convictions by following his Biblical model.Curry p. 44 As part of Smart's \\"Christianizing\\" of the Psalms, Jesus becomes a divine form of suffering, and Smart becomes further juxtaposed with his Biblical model as both praise God for Jesus's ultimate sacrifice and for the beauty of all creation. The Hymns and Psalms form their own sort of liturgy and attempt to reform Anglican liturgy by emphasising God's place in nature.Guest p. 251 Smart's Hymns are modelled after a tradition exemplified by Robert Nelson.Curry p. 74 They are steeped in Anglican tradition and also emphasise English patriotism and England's divine favour.Curry p. 76 The Hymns, according to Guest, \\"[express] a delight in creation that is largely absent from the work of other hymn-writers of the century, unless they are paraphrasing the words of David.\\"Guest p. 252 To Hawes, the Hymns exemplify an evangelical spirit that separates Smart from the traditional Anglican church.Hawes p. 134 Although he wrote his second set of hymns, Hymns for the Amusement of Children, for a younger audience, Smart cares more about emphasising the need for children to be moral instead of \\"innocent\\".Curry p. 91 These works have been seem as possibly too complicated for \\"amusement\\" because they employee ambiguities and complicated theological concepts.Booth p. 71 In essence, the Hymns for the Amusement of Children is intended to teach children the specific virtues that make up the subject matter of the work.Curry p. 93 Like the Hymns for the Amusement of Children, Smart's The Parables of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ were designed to teach morals.Parker p. 88 However, these Parables alter the original Biblical parables in order to simplify them and help them \\"make sense\\"Parker p. 95 As such, Todd Parker claims that the Parables, and the other religious works of Smart, are part of his final push for the \\"evangelization of London's reading public.\\"Parker p. 84 =Language= The language and commentary on language is of particular emphasis in Jubilate Agno. To Alan Jacobs, Smart's use of language represents his attempt to connect to the \\"Ur language\\", allowing Smart to connect to \\"the Word calling forth the world.\\"Jacobs p. 196 This is similar to David and Orpheus's ability as poets to create through their song. In his constant emphasis on the force of poetry, Jubilate Agno takes on the qualities of the Ars Poetica tradition.Ennis p. 8 As such, Smart is attempting to develop a poetic language that will connect him to the \\"one true, eternal poem.\\"Ennis p. 10 The poetic language that he creates is related to Adam's \\"onomathetic\\" tradition, or the idea that names hold significant weight in the universe and that Adam was able to join in with creation by naming objects.Costa p. 296 In Jubilate Agno, he describes his writing as creating \\"impressions\\".Liu p. 127 To accomplish this task, he incorporated puns and onomonpoeia in order to emphasise theological significance of his poetic language.Costa p. 305 In addition to these techniques, he relied on repeated language and allusions to traditional works and to scripture for a source of authority in various works, especially in his Hymns.Walsh p. 40 Along with scriptural authority, he relies on prophetic rhetoric to gain his audience's sympathy.Katz p. 54 During the 18th century, there was a debate over poetic language and the translations of Smart, especially of Horace, positioned him as one who sought to redeem traditional forms and understanding of language.Walsh \\"Something Old\\" p. 147 However, some critics, like Alan Liu, believe that translations are effectively forced to compete against the original works, and that Smart's language, at least in his translations, must constantly seek to undermine the original authors, like Horace.Liu p. 133 Not all critics agree with Liu, and those like Donald Davie believe that the Smart's translations cannot be compared to the original works, but are part of a system of Smart competing against the language of his contemporaries.Davie p. 825 Thomas Keymer further verified this point about Smart's translations by revealing that the poet claims, in William Toldervy's The History of Two Orphans, \\"But what heaven-exciting harmony might we not expect from that exalted genius, who can produce such lines as these following!\\" in anticipation of replacing the previous flawed translations of the Psalms.Keymer p. 57 Regardless of where he stood on the specific issue of translation Smart believed that there was an importance to language, which carried over to his constant revising of his poems to slowly correct them.Mahony p. 196 Many of Smart's poems served a dual purpose, and when put to music were altered to meet various standards.Mahony p. 200 By constantly revising, he ensured that his poems were always the \\"authentic\\" version.Mahony p. 203 =Gender= Smart's role as Mrs. Midnight along with his gendered comments in Jubilate Agno form the focal point for analysing his understanding of sexuality and gender. With Mrs. Midnight, Smart challenges the traditional social order found in 18th-century England.Bertelsen p. 364 However, some, like Lance Bertelsen, claim that the Mrs. Midnight persona reveals a split personality torn between masculine and feminine roles.Bertelsen p. 365 Fraser Easton claims that the existence of Mrs. Midnight proves that Smart identified a female connection to poetry and her character was used to defy popular 18th- century notions of who is able to attain knowledge.Easton p. 198 This role allowed Smart to focus on \\"social and sexual dimensions\\" in his satire.Easton p. 200 However, there is a potentially darker side to Mrs. Midnight, and she could represent his feelings that he was \\"emasculated by economic pressures.\\"Hawes \\"Bawdy\\" p. 9 The image of \\"horns\\" in Jubilate Agno is commonly viewed as a sexual image.Liu p. 121 Easton puts particular emphasis on the image of horns as a phallic image and contends that there are masculine and feminine horns throughout Smart's poem.Easton p. 234 Hawes picks up this theme and goes on to claims that the poem shows \\"that [Smart] had been 'feminized' as a cuckold.\\"Hawes \\"Bawdy\\" p. 4 In response to this possible cuckolding, Jubilate Agno predicts a misogynistic future while simultaneously undermining this effort with his constant associations to female creation.Hawes \\"Bawdy\\" p. 16 =Environmental= Smart had a reputation for being a \\"dedicated gardener\\".Dearnley p. 46 His poem the Hop-Garden helped to further this reputation, and even during his stay in a mental asylum he convinced others of his bond with nature. Johnson witnessed Smart's time in asylum and stated, \\"he has partly as much exercise as he used to have, for he digs in the garden.\\"Boswell's Life of Johnson Gardening, to Smart, was a way in which humans could interact with nature and actually \\"improve\\" on the natural landscape.Dearnley p. 47 However, Smart did not only write about gardens and vegetation, and his focus on his cat Jeoffry is widely known and his focus on nature connects him to those mistreated and neglected by 18th- century society.Bertelsen p. 375 The first fragment of Jubilate Agno is a poetic \\"Ark\\" that pairs humans with animals in order to purify all of creation. The whole work relies on his extensive background in botany and his knowledge of taxonomy.Mounsey p. 226 Smart actively participated in the 18th- century taxonomy systems established by Carl Linnaeus; however, Smart is mythologising his view of nature and creation when he adds information from Pliny the Elder into his work.Miller p. 109 By using this knowledge, Smart was able to give a \\"voice\\" to nature; he believed that nature, like his cat Jeoffry, is always praising God but needs a poet in order to bring out that voice. As such, themes of animals and language are merged in Jubilate Agno, and Jeoffry is transformed into a manifestation of the Ars Poetica tradition.Ennis p. 16 =Freemasonry= Many critics have focused on the role of David as planner of Solomon's Temple and his possible role with the Freemasons. Although it is not known for sure whether Smart was a Freemason or not, there is evidence suggesting that he was either part of the organisation or had a strong knowledge of its belief system.Rose p. 404 Based on personal admittance to contributing to A Defence of Freemasonry, contemporary verification of his participation in the volume and with Masonic meetings, there is enough to confirm \\"his participation in Masonic affairs.\\"Sherbo p. 221 Furthermore, there are accounts of Smart attending meetings at the Bell Tavern in Westminster.Lane, John Masonic Records, 1717‚Äì1886. London, 1886. p. 4, 23 The information available has led Marie Roberts to declare in her 1986 book British Poets and Secret Societies, \\"It has been universally accepted by scholars that Christopher Smart ... was a Freemason yet no record of his membership has been traced.\\"Roberts 1986 p. 10 However, in the notes to Chris Mounsey's 2001 book Christopher Smart: Clown of God, Marie Roberts' 1986 book is referred to as \\"an account of Smart's work which accepts his association with the Freemasons,\\" but in Mounsey's view, \\"Since neither Smart's name nor his pseudonyms appear in the records of the Freemasons, it is highly unlikely he was ever one of their number.\\"Mounsey 2001 p. 320 Smart's involvement with Masonry can be traced through his poems, including Jubilate Agno and A Song to David, with his constant references to Masonic ideas and his praise of Free Masonry in general.Roberts 1986 pp. 10‚Äì11 In Jubilate Agno, Smart declares \\"I am the Lord's builder and free and accepted MASON in CHRIST JESUS\\" (B 109). This declaration of being a \\"free and accepted MASON\\" has been interpreted to define his connection to speculative Masonry. The \\"in Christ Jesus\\" declaration places Smart within a Christian version of Masonry. He also declares himself as \\"the Lord's builder\\" and this connects his life with the building of King Solomon's Temple, an important Masonic idea. In A Song to David, Smart returns to the building of Solomon's Temple and incorporates many of the Masonic images that he uses in Jubilate Agno.Roberts 1986 p. 11 It was this detail that encouraged many critics to try and decode the \\"seven pillar\\" section of A Song of David along the lines of Masonic imagery. The poem follows two traditional sets of motions common to Freemason writing that mimic the image of Jacob's Ladder: movement from earth to heaven and movement from heaven to earth.Rose p. 405 This image further connects Freemason belief surrounding the relationship of David to Solomon's Temple.Rose p. 407 While these images, and further images in A Song to David are related also to depictions of the Temple in Isaac Newton's Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended (1728), the John Bunyan's Solomon's Temple Spiritualiz'd (1688), and to the Geneva Bible, these works were relied on by the Freemasons.Rose p. 409 Based on this theory, the first pillar, the Greek alpha, represents the mason's compass and \\"God as the Architect of the Universe.\\"Rose p. 406 The second, the Greek gamma, represents the mason's square.Rose pp. 406‚Äì407 In addition, the square represents the \\"vault of heaven.\\" The third, the Greek eta, represents Jacob's ladder itself and is connected to the complete idea of seven pillars.Rose p. 408 The fourth, the Greek theta, is either \\"the all- seeing eye or the point within a circle.\\" The fifth letter, the Greek iota, represents a pillar and the temple.Rose p. 410 The sixth letter, the Greek sigma, is an incomplete hexagram, otherwise known as \\"the blazing star or hexalpha\\" to the Freemasons. The last, the Greek omega, represents a lyre and David as a poet.Rose p. 413 Works Abimelech (1768) Smart, throughout his career, published many known works. Although his works are far too many to list, a few of his most famous and important publications during his life include: * A Song to David * Poems on Several Occasions (including the Hop- Garden) * The Hilliad * The Hop-Garden * Hymns and Spiritual Songs *Epistle to Mrs. Tyler *Psalm 58 *Psalm 114 *On A Lady Throwing Snow-Balls At Her Lover *For I Will Consider My Cat Jeoffry *On My Wife's Birth-Day *The Sweets Of Evening *Where's The Poker? *The Pig *The Long-Nosed Fair * Hymns for the Amusement of Children * The Oratorios Hannah and Abimelech * The Parables of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ * A Poetical Translation of the Fables of Phaedrus * The \\"Seatonian Prize\\" poems * A Translation of the Psalms of David * The Works of Horace Prose and Verse One of his most famous poems, Jubilate Agno, was not published until 1939, by William Force Stead. In 1943, lines from this poem were set to music by Benjamin Britten with the translated title Rejoice in the Lamb. He is also credited with the writing of A Defence of Freemasonry (1765), also known as A Defence of Freemasonry as practised in the regular lodges, both foreign and domestic, under the Constitution of the English Grand Master, in which is contained a refutation of Mr. Dermott's absurd and ridiculous account of Freemasonry, in his book entitled 'Ahiman Rezon' and the several quries therein reflecting on the regular Masons, briefly considered and answered, that response to Laurence Dermott's Ahiman Rezon. Although there is no direct attribution on the text's titlepage, it was established as his work since its publication, and it includes a poem directly attributed to him. A two-volume edition of the Complete Poems of Christopher Smart was published in 1949 by Norman Callan, Professor of English at Queen Mary College, London (now University). There have been numerous reprints. Penguin published Selected Poems in 1990.

As recorded on his birth certificate, his name is Archie and not Archibald.Morris, G. (1992) The joy of flying: Olympic gold, air force colonel, and teacher. University of California Black Alumni Series. The Regents of the University of California. Biography Williams attended University High School in Oakland, then San Mateo Junior College (now College of San Mateo). His coach, Dr. Oliver Byrd, was instrumental in preparing him for future achievements. Soon Williams transferred to the University of California, Berkeley to become a mechanical engineer and he continued to run track. Until 1936, Williams had never broken 49 seconds for the 440 yd (402 m). During 1936, however, Williams kept lowering his times and reached his peak at the NCAA championships, setting a world record in 400 m of 46.1. His time was set in the preliminaries, and he also prevailed in the final for a 47.0 victory. He followed that up with a first in the Olympic Trials, then went to Berlin and won the Olympic gold medal in the 400 m. When asked about the infamous incident in which Adolf Hitler reportedly refused to shake the hand of black fellow gold medalist Jesse Owens, Williams replied, \\"Hitler wouldn't shake my hand either.\\" After graduating from UC Berkeley with a degree in mechanical engineering, Williams was in the first Civilian Pilot Training class in 1939 at Oakland, CA. After earning his private pilot's license, he earned his instructor rating and was later a civilian instructor at Tuskegee. Entering the service in late 1942, he was one of only 14 African- Americans who were commissioned during World War II in the aviation meteorological cadet program; he graduated from the UCLA program on 6 September 1943. By September 1944, he was in the first Service Pilot training class at Tuskegee and, after graduation, instructed flight cadets in instrument flying as well as teaching meteorology. After the war, he earned qualification as a line pilot and then attended the Air Force Institute of Technology in 1948‚Äì1950 earning a B.S. in engineering sciences; he and fellow Tuskegee meteorologist Milton Hopkins were the 3rd and 4th black AF officers to attend this prestigious program. Williams remained a weather officer and rated pilot his entire career, earning his command pilot rating and commanding several weather detachments before retirement from the air force in 1964. A serious leg injury at a meet in Sweden in 1936 ended his running career, but he became a commercial pilot. During World War II, which Williams once whimsically referred to as his \\"return to the Olympics‚Äîin the Pacific,\\" Williams was a pilot in the U.S. Air Force and retired from the military 22 years later as a lieutenant colonel. A flight instructor while in the air force, Williams remained in education following his military retirement and taught mathematics and computers in California high schools. Archie Williams was a teacher for 21 years until his retirement at age 72 in Sir Francis Drake High School in San Anselmo. He was noted for his love for teaching and helping students, including future author Konrad Dryden. Williams was a member of the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. He died in Fairfax, California aged 78.

Her novels have been successfully dramatized, most notably the film Gone to Earth in 1950 by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. The novels are thought to have inspired the famous parody Cold Comfort Farm (1932) by Stella Gibbons. Life She was born Mary Gladys Meredith in 1881 at Leighton Lodge in the Shropshire village of Leighton, 8 miles (13 km) southeast of Shrewsbury. Her father, George Edward Meredith, a private schoolteacher, inspired his daughter with his own love of literature and the local countryside. Her mother Sarah Alice was descended from a family related to Sir Walter Scott. Mary explored the countryside around her childhood home, and developed a sense of detailed observation and description, of both people and places, which later infused her poetry and prose. At the age of one year, she moved with her parents to Much Wenlock, where they lived at a house called The Grange outside the town. Mary was taught by her father, then sent to a finishing school for girls at Southport in 1895. Her parents moved the family again in Shropshire, north to Stanton upon Hine Heath in 1896, before settling in 1902 at Meole Brace, now on the outskirts of Shrewsbury. At the age of 20, she developed symptoms of Graves' disease, a thyroid disorder that resulted in bulging protuberant eyes and throat goitre. It caused ill health throughout her life and probably contributed to her early death. This affliction resulted in her being empathic with the suffering. She is considered to have created a fictional counterpart in the disfiguring harelip of Prue Sarn, the heroine of Precious Bane. Webb's first published writing was a five-verse poem, written on hearing news of the Shrewsbury rail accident in October 1907. Her brother, Kenneth Meredith, so liked the poem and thought it potentially comforting for those affected by the disaster that, without her knowledge, he took it to the newspaper offices of the Shrewsbury Chronicle, which printed the poem anonymously. Mary, who usually burnt her early poems, was appalled before learning that the newspaper had received appreciative letters from its readers. In 1912, Webb married Henry Bertram Law Webb, a teacher, at Meole Brace's Holy Trinity parish church. At first he supported her literary interests. They lived for a time in Weston-super-Mare, before moving back to Mary's beloved Shropshire, where they worked as market gardeners until Henry secured a job as a teacher at the Priory School for boys in Shrewsbury. The couple lived briefly in Rose Cottage near the village of Pontesbury between the years 1914 and 1916, during which time she wrote The Golden Arrow. Her time in the village was commemorated in 1957 by the opening of the Mary Webb School. The publication of The Golden Arrow in 1917 enabled them to move to Lyth Hill, Bayston Hill, a place she loved, where they bought a plot of land and built Spring Cottage. In 1921, they bought a second property in London, in the hope that by being in the city, she could achieve greater literary recognition. This, however, did not happen. By 1927, she was suffering increasingly bad health, her marriage was failing, and she returned to Spring Cottage alone. She died at St Leonards on Sea, aged 46. She was buried in Shrewsbury, at the General Cemetery in Longden Road. Legacy Her writing in general was reviewed as notable for poetic descriptions of nature. Another aspect throughout her work was a close and fatalistic view on human psychology. She won the Prix Femina Vie Heureuse for Precious Bane. After her death, Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin brought about her commercial success when, at a dinner of the Royal Literary Fund in 1928, he referred to her as a neglected genius. Consequently her collected works were republished in a standard edition by Jonathan Cape, becoming best sellers in the 1930s and running into many editions. Stella Gibbons's 1932 novel Cold Comfort Farm was a parody of Webb's work,Literary Encyclopedia: Cold Comfort Farm as well as of other \\"loam and lovechild\\" writers like Sheila Kaye-Smith and Mary E. Mann Hammill, Faye Cold Comfort Farm, D. H. Lawrence, and English Literary Culture Between the Wars, Modern Fiction Studies 47.4 (2001) 831-854 and, further back, Thomas Hardy. In a 1966 Punch article, Gibbons observed: > The large agonised faces in Mary Webb's book annoyed me ... I did not > believe people were any more despairing in Herefordshire [sic] than in > Camden Town. Literary critic John Sutherland refers to the genre as the \\"soil and gloom romance\\" and credits Webb as its pioneer.Sutherland, John.

The theorem is fundamental to the deeper understanding of Boolean algebra that emerged in the first half of the 20th century. The theorem was first proved by Marshall H. Stone. Stone was led to it by his study of the spectral theory of operators on a Hilbert space. Stone spaces Each Boolean algebra B has an associated topological space, denoted here S(B), called its Stone space. The points in S(B) are the ultrafilters on B, or equivalently the homomorphisms from B to the two-element Boolean algebra. The topology on S(B) is generated by a (closed) basis consisting of all sets of the form :\\\\\\\\{ x \\\\in S(B) \\\\mid b \\\\in x\\\\\\\\}, where b is an element of B. This is the topology of pointwise convergence of nets of homomorphisms into the two-element Boolean algebra. For every Boolean algebra B, S(B) is a compact totally disconnected Hausdorff space; such spaces are called Stone spaces (also profinite spaces). Conversely, given any topological space X, the collection of subsets of X that are clopen (both closed and open) is a Boolean algebra. Representation theorem A simple version of Stone's representation theorem states that every Boolean algebra B is isomorphic to the algebra of clopen subsets of its Stone space S(B). The isomorphism sends an element b‚ààB to the set of all ultrafilters that contain b. This is a clopen set because of the choice of topology on S(B) and because B is a Boolean algebra. Restating the theorem using the language of category theory; the theorem states that there is a duality between the category of Boolean algebras and the category of Stone spaces. This duality means that in addition to the correspondence between Boolean algebras and their Stone spaces, each homomorphism from a Boolean algebra A to a Boolean algebra B corresponds in a natural way to a continuous function from S(B) to S(A). In other words, there is a contravariant functor that gives an equivalence between the categories. This was an early example of a nontrivial duality of categories. The theorem is a special case of Stone duality, a more general framework for dualities between topological spaces and partially ordered sets. The proof requires either the axiom of choice or a weakened form of it. Specifically, the theorem is equivalent to the Boolean prime ideal theorem, a weakened choice principle that states that every Boolean algebra has a prime ideal. An extension of the classical Stone duality to the category of Boolean spaces (= zero-dimensional locally compact Hausdorff spaces) and continuous maps (respectively, perfect maps) was obtained by G. D. Dimov (respectively, by H. P. Doctor).

Although she is best known for her large-scale sculpture and installation art, Bourgeois was also a prolific painter and printmaker. She explored a variety of themes over the course of her long career including domesticity and the family, sexuality and the body, as well as death and the unconscious. These themes connect to events from her childhood which she considered to be a therapeutic process. Although Bourgeois exhibited with the Abstract Expressionists and her work has much in common with Surrealism and Feminist art, she was not formally affiliated with a particular artistic movement. Life Sculpture by Bourgeois in the Domestic Incidents group exhibit at London's Tate Modern Turbine Hall, 2006 = Early life = Bourgeois was born on 25 December 1911 in Paris, France. She was the second child of three born to parents Jos√©phine Fauriaux and Louis Bourgeois. She had an older sister and a younger brother. Her parents owned a gallery that dealt primarily in antique tapestries. A few years after her birth, her family moved out of Paris and set up a workshop for tapestry restoration below their apartment in Choisy-le-Roi, for which Bourgeois filled in the designs where they had become worn. The lower part of the tapestries were always damaged which was usually the characters' feet and animals' paws. In 1930, Bourgeois entered the Sorbonne to study mathematics and geometry, subjects that she valued for their stability, saying \\"I got peace of mind, only through the study of rules nobody could change.\\" Her mother died in 1932, while Bourgeois was studying mathematics. Her mother's death inspired her to abandon mathematics and to begin studying art. She continued to study art by joining classes where translators were needed for English-speaking students, in which those translators were not charged tuition. In one such class Fernand L√©ger saw her work and told her she was a sculptor, not a painter. Bourgeois took a job as a docent, leading tours at the Mus√©e de Louvre.Greenberg, J (2003) Runaway Girl: The Artist Louise Bourgeois. Harry N. Abrams, Inc P.30. Bourgeois graduated from the Sorbonne in 1935. She began studying art in Paris, first at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts and √âcole du Louvre, and after 1932 in the independent academies of Montparnasse and Montmartre such as Acad√©mie Colarossi, Acad√©mie Ranson, Acad√©mie Julian, Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re and with Andr√© Lhote, Fernand L√©ger, Paul Colin and Cassandre.(fr) Xavier Girard, Louise Bourgeois face √† face, Seuil, 2016, p 27 Bourgeois had a desire for first-hand experience and frequently visited studios in Paris, learning techniques from the artists and assisting with exhibitions. She opened a print shop next door to her father's tapestry gallery, where she met as a customer the visiting American art professor Robert Goldwater. They married and moved to the United States (where he taught at New York University). They had three sons (one adopted) and the marriage lasted until his death in 1973. Bourgeois settled in New York City with her husband in 1938. She continued her education at the Art Students League of New York, studying painting under Vaclav Vytlacil, and also producing sculptures and prints. \\"The first painting had a grid: the grid is a very peaceful thing because nothing can go wrong ... everything is complete. There is no room for anxiety ... everything has a place, everything is welcome.\\" Bourgeois incorporated those autobiographical references to her sculpture Quarantania I, on display in the Cullen Sculpture Garden at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. =Middle years= For Bourgeois, the early 1940s represented the difficulties of a transition to a new country and the struggle to enter the exhibition world of New York City. Her work during this time was constructed from junkyard scraps and driftwood which she used to carve upright wood sculptures. The impurities of the wood were then camouflaged with paint, after which nails were employed to invent holes and scratches in the endeavor to portray some emotion. The Sleeping Figure is one such example which depicts a war figure that is unable to face the real world due to vulnerability. Throughout her life, Bourgeois's work was created from revisiting of her own troubled past as she found inspiration and temporary catharsis from her childhood years and the abuse she suffered from her father. Slowly she developed more artistic confidence, although her middle years are more opaque, which might be due to the fact that she received very little attention from the art world despite having her first solo show in 1945. In 1951, her father died and she became an American citizen. In 1954, Bourgeois joined the American Abstract Artists Group, with several contemporaries, among them Barnett Newman and Ad Reinhardt. At this time she also befriended the artists Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko, and Jackson Pollock. As part of the American Abstract Artists Group, Bourgeois made the transition from wood and upright structures to marble, plaster, and bronze as she investigated concerns like fear, vulnerability, and loss of control. This transition was a turning point. She referred to her art as a series or sequence closely related to days and circumstances, describing her early work as the fear of falling which later transformed into the art of falling and the final evolution as the art of hanging in there. Her conflicts in real life empowered her to authenticate her experiences and struggles through a unique art form. In 1958, Bourgeois and her husband moved into a terraced house at West 20th Street, in Chelsea, Manhattan, where she lived and worked for the rest of her life. Despite the fact that she rejected the idea that her art was feminist, Bourgeois's subject was the feminine. Works such as Femme Maison (1946-1947), Torso self-portrait (1963-1964), Arch of Hysteria (1993), all depict the feminine body. In the late 1960s, her imagery became more explicitly sexual as she explored the relationship between men and women and the emotional impact of her troubled childhood. Sexually explicit sculptures such as Janus Fleuri, (1968) show she was not afraid to use the female form in new ways. She has been quoted to say \\"My work deals with problems that are pre-gender,\\" she wrote. \\"For example, jealousy is not male or female.\\" With the rise of feminism, her work found a wider audience. Despite this assertion, in 1976 Femme Maison was featured on the cover of Lucy Lippard's book From the Center: Feminist Essays on Women's Art and became an icon of the feminist art movement. = Later life = In 1973, Bourgeois started teaching at the Pratt Institute, Cooper Union, Brooklyn College and the New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture. From 1974 until 1977, Bourgeois worked at the School of Visual Arts in New York where she taught printmaking and sculpture. She also taught for many years in the public schools in Great Neck, Long Island. In the early 1970s, Bourgeois held gatherings called \\"Sunday, bloody Sundays\\" at her home in Chelsea. These salons would be filled with young artists and students whose work would be critiqued by Bourgeois. Bourgeois's ruthlessness in critique and her dry sense of humor led to the naming of these meetings. Bourgeois inspired many young students to make art that was feminist in nature. However, Louise's long-time friend and assistant, Jerry Gorovoy, has stated that Louise considered her own work \\"pre-gender\\". Bourgeois aligned herself with activists and became a member of the Fight Censorship Group, a feminist anti-censorship collective founded by fellow artist Anita Steckel. In the 1970s, the group defended the use of sexual imagery in artwork. Steckel argued, \\"If the erect penis is not wholesome enough to go into museums, it should not be considered wholesome enough to go into women.\\" In 1978 Bourgeois was commissioned by the General Services Administration to create Facets of the Sun, her first public sculpture. The work was installed outside of a federal building in Manchester, New Hampshire. Louise Bourgeois, Eyes, 1982. Photo by Mark Menjivar. Courtesy of Landmarks, the public art program of the University of Texas at Austin. Bourgeois received her first retrospective in 1982, by the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Until then, she had been a peripheral figure in art whose work was more admired than acclaimed. In an interview with Artforum, timed to coincide with the opening of her retrospective, she revealed that the imagery in her sculptures was wholly autobiographical. She shared with the world that she obsessively relived through her art the trauma of discovering, as a child, that her English governess was also her father's mistress. At the age of seventy-one, she carved Eyes, a marble sculpture now on permanent loan to Landmarks, the public art program of The University of Texas at Austin by The Met. Bourgeois with To fall on deaf ears, in 1991 In 1989, Bourgeois made a drypoint etching, Mud Lane, of the home she maintained in Stapleton, Staten Island, which she treated as a sculptural environment rather than a living space. Bourgeois had another retrospective in 1989 at Documenta 9 in Kassel, Germany. In 1993, when the Royal Academy of Arts staged its comprehensive survey of American art in the 20th century, the organizers did not consider Bourgeois's work of significant importance to include in the survey. However, this survey was criticized for many omissions, with one critic writing that \\"whole sections of the best American art have been wiped out\\" and pointing out that very few women were included. In 2000 her works were selected to be shown at the opening of the Tate Modern in London. In 2001, she showed at the Hermitage Museum. In 2010, in the last year of her life, Bourgeois used her art to speak up for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) equality. She created the piece I Do, depicting two flowers growing from one stem, to benefit the nonprofit organization Freedom to Marry. Bourgeois has said \\"Everyone should have the right to marry. To make a commitment to love someone forever is a beautiful thing.\\" Bourgeois had a history of activism on behalf of LGBT equality, having created artwork for the AIDS activist organization ACT UP in 1993. = Death = Bourgeois died of heart failure on 31 May 2010, at the Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. Wendy Williams, the managing director of the Louise Bourgeois Studio, announced her death. She had continued to create artwork until her death, her last pieces being finished the week before. The New York Times said that her work \\"shared a set of repeated themes, centered on the human body and its need for nurture and protection in a frightening world.\\" Her husband, Robert Goldwater, died in 1973. She was survived by two sons, Alain Bourgeois and Jean-Louis Bourgeois. Her first son, Michel, died in 1990. Work =Femme Maison= Femme Maison (1946‚Äì47) is a series of paintings in which Bourgeois explores the relationship of a woman and the home. In the works, women's heads have been replaced with houses, isolating their bodies from the outside world and keeping their minds domestic. This theme goes along with the dehumanization of modern art. =Destruction of the Father= Destruction of the Father (1974) is a biographical and a psychological exploration of the power dominance of father and his offspring. The piece is a flesh-toned installation in a soft and womb-like room. Made of plaster, latex, wood, fabric, and red light, Destruction of the Father was the first piece in which she used soft materials on a large scale. Upon entering the installation, the viewer stands in the aftermath of a crime. Set in a stylized dining room (with the dual impact of a bedroom), the abstract blob-like children of an overbearing father have rebelled, murdered, and eaten him. = Exorcism in Art = In 1982, The Museum of Modern Art in New York City featured unknown artist, Louise Bourgeois' work. She was 70 years old and a mixed media artist who worked on paper, with metal, marble and animal skeletal bones. Childhood family traumas \\"bred an exorcism in art\\" and she desperately attempted to purge her unrest with her work. She felt she could get in touch with issues of female identity, the body, the fractured family, long before the art world and society considered them expressed subjects in art. This was Bourgeous' way to find her center and stabilize her emotional unrest. The New York Times said at the time that \\"her work is charged with tenderness and violence, acceptance and defiance, ambivalence and conviction.\\" =Cells= While in her eighties, Bourgeois produced two series of enclosed installation works she referred to as Cells. Many are small enclosures into which the viewer is prompted to peer inward at arrangements of symbolic objects; others are small rooms into which the viewer is invited to enter. In the cell pieces, Bourgeois uses earlier sculptural forms, found objects as well as personal items that carried strong personal emotional charge for the artist. The cells enclose psychological and intellectual states, primarily feelings of fear and pain. Bourgeois stated that the Cells represent \\"different types of pain; physical, emotional and psychological, mental and intellectual ... Each Cell deals with a fear. Fear is pain ... Each Cell deals with the pleasure of the voyeur, the thrill of looking and being looked at.\\" =Maman= Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao In the late 1990s, Bourgeois began using the spider as a central image in her art. Maman, which stands more than nine metres high, is a steel and marble sculpture from which an edition of six bronzes were subsequently cast. It first made an appearance as part of Bourgeois's commission for The Unilever Series for Tate Modern's Turbine Hall in 2000, and recently, the sculpture was installed at the Qatar National Convention Centre in Doha, Qatar.Celebrated sculpture finds home at QNCC in the Gulf Times, 24 October 2011 Her largest spider sculpture titled Maman stands at over and has been installed in numerous locations around the world. It is the largest Spider sculpture ever made by Bourgeois. Moreover, Maman alludes to the strength of her mother, with metaphors of spinning, weaving, nurture and protection. The prevalence of the spider motif in her work has given rise to her nickname as Spiderwoman. = Maisons fragiles / Empty Houses = Bourgeois's Maisons fragiles / Empty Houses sculptures are parallel, high metallic structures supporting a simple tray. One must see them in person to feel their impact. They are not threatening or protecting, but bring out the depths of anxiety within you. Bachelard's findings from psychologists' tests show that an anxious child will draw a tall narrow house with no base. Bourgeois had a rocky/traumatic childhood and this could support the reason behind why these pieces were constructed. =Printmaking= Bourgeois's printmaking flourished during the early and late phases of her career: in the 1930s and 1940s, when she first came to New York from Paris, and then again starting in the 1980s, when her work began to receive wide recognition. Early on, she made prints at home on a small press, or at the renowned workshop Atelier 17. That period was followed by a long hiatus, as Bourgeois turned her attention fully to sculpture. It was not until she was in her seventies that she began to make prints again, encouraged first by print publishers. She set up her old press, and added a second, while also working closely with printers who came to her house to collaborate. A very active phase of printmaking followed, lasting until the artist's death. Over the course of her life, Bourgeois created approximately 1,500 printed compositions. In 1990, Bourgeois decided to donate the complete archive of her printed work to The Museum of Modern Art. In 2013, The Museum launched the online catalogue raisonn√©, \\"Louise Bourgeois: The Complete Prints & Books.\\" The site focuses on the artist's creative process and places Bourgeois's prints and illustrated books within the context of her overall production by including related works in other mediums that deal with the same themes and imagery. =Pervasive themes= Tate Gallery, 2016 One theme of Bourgeois's work is that of childhood trauma and hidden emotion. After Louise's mother became sick with influenza Louise's father began having affairs with other women, most notably with Sadie, Louise's English tutor. Louise was extremely watchful and aware of the situation. This was the beginning of the artist's engagement with double standards related to gender and sexuality, which was expressed in much of her work. She recalls her father saying \\"I love you\\" repeatedly to her mother, despite infidelity. \\"He was the wolf, and she was the rational hare, forgiving and accepting him as he was.\\", additional text. Her 1993 work Cell: You Better Grow Up, part of her Cell series, speaks directly to Louise's childhood trauma and the insecurity that surrounded her. 2002's Give or Take is defined by hidden emotion, representing the intense dilemma that people face throughout their lives as they attempt to balance the actions of giving and taking. This dilemma is not only represented by the shape of the sculpture, but also the heaviness of the material this piece is made of. Bourgeois has explored the concept of feminity through challenging the patriarchal standards and making artwork about motherhood rather than showing women as muses or ideals. She has been described as the 'reluctant hero of feminist art'. Architecture and memory are important components of Bourgeois's work. In numerous interviews, Louise describes architecture as a visual expression of memory, or memory as a type of architecture. The memory which is featured in much of her work is an invented memory - about the death or exorcism of her father. The imagined memory is interwoven with her real memories including living across from a slaughterhouse and her father's affair. To Louise her father represented injury and war, aggrandizement of himself and belittlement of others and most importantly a man who represented betrayal. Her 1993 work Cell (Three White Marble Spheres) speaks to fear and captivity. The mirrors within the present an altered and distorted reality. Sexuality is undoubtedly one of the most important themes in the work of Louise Bourgeois. The link between sexuality and fragility or insecurity is also powerful. It has been argued that this stems from her childhood memories and her father's affairs. 1952's Spiral Woman combines Louise's focus on female sexuality and torture. The flexing leg and arm muscles indicate that the Spiral Woman is still above though she is being suffocated and hung. 1995's In and Out uses cold metal materials to link sexuality with anger and perhaps even captivity. The spiral in her work demonstrates the dangerous search for precarious equilibrium, accident-free permanent change, disarray, vertigo, whirlwind. There lies the simultaneously positive and negative, both future and past, breakup and return, hope and vanity, plan and memory. Louise Bourgeois's work is powered by confessions, self-portraits, memories, fantasies of a restless being who is seeking through her sculpture a peace and an order which were missing throughout her childhood. = Collaboration =  Do Not Abandon Me  This collaboration took place over a span of two years with British artist Tracey Emin. The work was exhibited in London months after Bourgeois's death in 2010. The subject matter consists of male and female images. Although they appear sexual, it portrays a tiny female figure paying homage to a giant male figure, like a God. Louise Bourgeois did the water colors and Tracey Emin did the drawing on top. It took Emin two years to decide how to figure out what she would contribute in the collaboration. When she knew what to do, she finished all of the drawings in a day and believes every single one worked out perfectly. I Lost You is about losing children, losing life. Bourgeois had to bury her son as a parent. Abandonment for her is not only about losing her mother but her son as well. Despite the age gap between the two artists and differences in their work, the collaboration worked out gently and easily.

The community is notable as the place where Judge Roy Bean, the \\"Law West of the Pecos\\", had his saloon and practiced law. History Langtry was originally established in 1882 by the Southern Pacific Railroad as a grading camp called \\"Eagle Nest.\\" It was later renamed for George Langtry, an engineer and foreman who supervised the immigrant Chinese work crews building the railroad in the area. Roy Bean arrived soon after completion of the railroad and set up a tent saloon on company land. He later built a wooden structure for his saloon, which he called \\"The Jersey Lilly\\" after the well-known British stage actress Lillie Langtry. She was a native of the island of Jersey. (N√©e Le Breton, Langtry was her married name and she was not related to George Langtry.) Bean used the saloon as his headquarters when authorized as a justice of the peace and notary public. He called himself the \\"Law West of the Pecos.\\" After a notable career as justice of the peace, Bean died in 1903. In 1884 the town was authorized a post office. In 1892 it had a general store, a railroad depot, and two saloons. Langtry began to decline after the highway was moved slightly north in the early 1900s for a more direct east- west route. Once bypassed, the town's businesses lost revenue and jobs. When in the 1920s Southern Pacific moved its facilities away, more jobs were lost and the town population dwindled to 50. By the 1970s the population dipped as low as 40. Tourism to the Judge Roy Bean Visitor Center continues to keep the town alive.

While independent, it has been closely tied with Nintendo throughout its history. The company is headquartered in Chiyoda, Tokyo, and it also has a building at Kai, Yamanashi. The company got its name because \\"each letter put them one step ahead of IBM\\". The company is most famous for their work on the Kirby and Mother series, as well as the first two Super Smash Bros. games. The logo, Inutamago (Japanese: Áä¨„Åü„Åæ„Åî \\"Dog Eggs\\") depicts a dog incubating eggs, which has been in use since 1998. History HAL Laboratory started off making games for the MSX system and the Commodore VIC-20. After financial strain brought on from the development of Metal Slader Glory (1991) for the Famicom, Nintendo offered to rescue HAL from bankruptcy on the condition that HAL employee Satoru Iwata was appointed as its president, which he became between 1993 and 2000. (Translation ) Iwata later became president of Nintendo. The logo 'Inutamago' was commissioned in 1998 by then HAL Laboratory president, Satoru Iwata. This was handled by Shigesato Itoi who went through many different ideas. He went with the theme of 'an unexpected bond...one that brings the birth of something new' which would lead to the idea of a dog incubating eggs in a nest. The actual design was created by Mr. Akiyama of HAL. The design was indoctrinated by HAL Laboratory in 1998 although the reception at first was lukewarm. In many of its games during the early to mid-1990s it used the name HALKEN, derived from their Japanese name. Some of its early titles were also released as HAL America Inc. (HAI), a North American subsidiary of the company led by Yash Terakura and based in Beaverton, Oregon, USA. In August 2001, HAL Laboratory and Nintendo established Warpstar, Inc. in a joint venture (where each part owns 50% of the company) with the objective to manage the Kirby IP along with its copyright, which the decision for the creation of the company was mainly for Kirby: Right Back at Ya! anime series. After the end of the anime, the company still exists and now works with license and supervision of the character in games, merchandise and other media. For years, the company's development center at Tokyo was located within the eighth floor of the Nintendo Tokyo Prefecture Building which itself is located Nihombashi, Chuo- ku, Tokyo, but in August 2003, the company announced that a restructuration was happening and that the development center at the building would be relocated to HAL's main office building in Kanda Suda-cho, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo. While this change happened on the Tokyo based company, the Yamanashi part of HAL was unaffected by the changes of the company. In 2017, HAL Laboratory announced that they would develop and self-publish games for mobile devices with the brand HAL Egg and focusing on completely new characters and franchises, with different types of design than what the developers of the company usually do. The first title launched by them was Part Time UFO. In 2020, HAL Laboratory updated their employee numbers from 169 to 195 and the company came back to the new Nintendo Tokyo Building with its main office and the Tokyo development studio, being on the same building along with Nintendo EPD Tokyo, Nintendo PTD Tokyo, 1-Up Studio and Game Freak like a keiretsu.https://www.hallab.co.jp/company/profile/ With that said, the Yamanashi studio continues on the same location as before and wasn't transferred to the Nintendo building.

It is a common and widespread species in open habitats over much of its range, although there are sizable gaps in its distribution. It is sometimes referred to as a Guinea Pigeon due to its similar coloring to some species of guineafowl. Taxonomy In 1743 the English naturalist George Edwards included a description and a picture of the speckled pigeon in his A Natural History of Uncommon Birds. His drawing was made from two live birds at the home the Duke of Richmond in London. Edwards was told that the pigeons had been brought from the inland region of Guinea in West Africa. When in 1758 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the tenth edition, he placed the speckled pigeon with all the other pigeons in the genus Columba. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Columba guinea and cited Edwards's work. There are two recognised subspecies: * C. g. guinea Linnaeus, 1758 ‚Äì Mauritania to Ethiopia south to Democratic Republic of the Congo and north Malawi * C. g. phaeonota Gray, GR, 1856 ‚Äì southwest Angola to Zimbabwe and South Africa Nest box for Columba guinea in the wall of a homestead in Zerfenti, (Ethiopia) Description This is a large pigeon at 41 cm in length. Its back and wings are rufous, the latter heavily speckled with white spots. The rest of the upperparts and underparts are blue-grey, and the head is grey with red patches around the eye. The neck is brownish, streaked with white, and the legs are red. Sexes are similar, but immatures are browner than adults and lack the red eye patches. The call is a loud doo-doo-doo. Behaviour and ecology The speckled pigeon is frequently seen around human habitation and cultivation. Most of its food is vegetable, and it gathers in large numbers where grain or groundnuts are available. This species builds a large stick nest on protected rocky outcrops and in urban areas often atop covered pergola pillars and on flat roofs under deep eaves and lays two white eggs. Its flight is quick, with regular beats and an occasional sharp flick of the wings that are characteristic of pigeons in general.

Howells was born in Ponterwyd in Cardiganshire. He was the son of David John and Mary Blodwen Howells, both farmers. Education Howells was educated at Ponterwyd Primary School and Ardwyn Grammar School, Aberystwyth. During his parliamentary career Howells also retained close links with Aberystwyth and Lampeter universities.Dictionary of Liberal Biography, (1998) Politicos P.190 Pre- parliamentary career Howells' main living was as a hill farmer in Glennydd, Ponterwyd in Cardiganshire. He held some 750 acres there with around 3,000 sheep. The majority were prize winning Speckled Faces. Howells was also a champion sheep shearer. He held senior positions in the British Wool Marketing Board and was also chairman of the Wool Producers of Wales, 1977‚Äì1983. Politically, Howells was elected to Cardiganshire County Council as an Independent in 1952. At this time it was normal practice in Welsh rural counties for Liberal members to stand as independents. However in 1958 he was briefly appointed as agent for the prospective Labour candidate for Cardiganshire, Loti Rees Hughes. Parliamentary career Howells was selected as the parliamentary candidate for Brecon and Radnor in 1968. He was the first Liberal to contest the seat in the post-war period. He came third with 18.9 per cent of the vote. During this period Howells became one of the central players in the Welsh Liberal Party. In 1972 Howells was selected as the parliamentary candidate for Cardiganshire, a seat with a longstanding Liberal tradition. It had been held by the Liberal MP, Roderic Bowen, until his defeat by Labour's Elystan Morgan in 1966. In the February 1974 general election Howells defeated Morgan and retained the constituency in several different forms until 1992. Thus he was Member of Parliament (MP) for Cardigan (1974‚Äì1983) and Ceredigion and Pembroke North (1983‚Äì1992) after boundary changes. Howells was the Liberal Party's spokesman on Welsh Affairs (1979‚Äì1987) and agriculture (1987‚Äì92). His Westminster secretary and agent was Judi Lewis (Welsh Liberal Democrat chief executive 1992‚Äì1997) whilst one of his researchers was Mark Williams who would later win the seat for the Liberal Democrats in 2005. In 1992, Howells unexpectedly lost his seat to Plaid Cymru (which moved from fourth place to first). Plaid Cymru had formed an alliance with the Wales Green Party which attracted considerable support from non-Welsh speakers in the constituency. Howells was made a life peer as Baron Geraint, of Ponterwyd in the County of Dyfed. Howells was a close friend of both Richard Livsey and Emlyn Hooson, both of whom he served with at Westminster in the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Howells was a passionate pro- devolutionist. He played a lead role in the 1979 devolution campaign in Wales. He was also able to get the Farmers Union of Wales (FUW) recognition as one of the official unions for government negotiations during the Lib-Lab pact on the 1970s.Dictionary of Liberal Biography, Politicos (1998)' p.190 Personal life Geraint Howells married Mary Olwen Hughes on 7 September 1957. They had two children: Gaenor, a newsreader with the BBC World Service, born in 1961 and Mari born in 1965.

History MTV Select launched in 1997 (a similar series MTV Dial aired between 1996 and 1997 on MTV Europe. Upon launch MTV Select was available across Europe on MTV Europe. As MTV began to regionalize the channel across Europe it launched regional versions of the program including MTV Select German, Italian, UK, and pan-European versions that aired on local MTV channels: MTV Germany, MTV UK and Ireland, MTV Italy and the original European channel MTV Europe. MTV Select would later launch regional versions in Spain, France, Poland, and Romania. MTV Networks Europe eventually replaced MTV Select with the US version of MTV TRL. Prior to MTV Select finishing MTV channels in Italy, Germany, UK and Romania already had their own versions of MTV TRL. MTV Select later appeared on MTV Japan in 2000 and was later replaced. The show is currently a big hit on MTV India, where the show format is to telecast live user requests, received through phone calls or e‚Äëmails. With the launch of MTV Canada, a Canadian version of MTV Select aired on A‚ÄëChannel, MTV Canada, and Toronto One. Hosted by Amanda MacKay and Brian Adler and taped in Vancouver, British Columbia, the show featured interviews with bands and singers, video requests, and a countdown of the ten songs that received the most votes at the Select website, starting at Number 10 on Monday and ending at Number 1 on Friday. When MTV Canada was rebranded as Razer, the show was renamed 969. Today, most European MTVs no longer have live studio-based interactive request shows. Broadcasting MTV Select broadcast Monday to Friday on MTV Europe and later MTV Nordic from 17:00 to 18:00 (CET). MTV Select in the UK & Ireland broadcast Monday to Sunday from 16:00 to 18:00 (London/Dublin); later moving to weekends from 10:00 to 12:00 before the weekend edition was replaced by the short-lived MTV On Call.

As a census-designated place, it had a population of 5,407 at the 2010 census. Overview Laughlin AFB, the largest pilot training base in the US Air Force, is home to the 47th Flying Training Wing of the Air Education and Training Command. On weekdays, the airfield sees more takeoffs and landings than any other airport in the country. History = Laughlin Army Air Field = leftLaughlin AFB was originally named Laughlin Army Air Field on March 3, 1943, after Jack T. Laughlin, a B-17E Flying Fortress pilot. He was trained as a pilot and was actually co-pilot of B-17E, tail number 41-2476. On the day of his first bombing mission, he was bumped by the Group Commander Major Stanley K. Robinson (Robinson was co-pilot next to pilot Capt. Walter W. Sparks). Major Robinson brought along his own combat-experienced navigator, Lt. Richard Cease. Laughlin had no assigned position on the plane for the mission. He became Del Rio's first World War II casualty when the plane he was flying in (most likely as a waist gunner for the mission) was lost at sea, having succumbed to damage received over the Makassar Strait on 29 (or 28) January 1942. The damage occurred during two bombing runs against Japanese warships and transports in the Makassar Strait off the coast of Balikpapan, Borneo. The field became simply Laughlin Field on November 11, 1943, and later an Army Air Force Auxiliary Field. During World War II, Laughlin's primary mission was the training of B-26 pilots and aircrews. It was closed in October 1945. = Laughlin Air Force Base = Laughlin Air Force Base reopened on May 1, 1952. In October 1952, ATC transferred the base to Crew Training Air Force (CREWTAF) and activated the 3645th Flying Training Wing (Fighter), as a combat crew replacement training facility for pilots headed for Korea. Training provided new pilots with basic bombing and gunnery combat skills in the F-80 Shooting Star, F-84 Thunderjet, and T-33 jet aircraft, but within short time crews used only the T-33. In September 1955, Laughlin came under the control of the Flying Training Air Force and switched missions with Williams Air Force Base, Arizona. Laughlin undertook single- engine pilot training, still using the T-33.  Strategic Air Command  The Air Force transferred jurisdiction of the base to the Strategic Air Command on April 1, 1957, and the 4080th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing (Light) moved there from Turner Air Force Base, Georgia. Following the graduation of the last class in March 1957, ATC inactivated the 3645th FTW. The 4080th Wing provided high-altitude reconnaissance and air sampling using the Lockheed U-2A and the RB-57D Canberra. The 4080th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing was redesignated as the 4080th Strategic Wing on June 15, 1960, and the RB-57 mission was phased out. Laughlin U-2s were among the first to provide photographic evidence of Soviet missile installations in Cuba in 1962 when 4080th U-2 pilot Major Steve Heyser flew his U-2C over Cuba after taking off from Edwards AFB, California. Heyser landed at McCoy AFB, Florida, following the mission, with McCoy becoming a U-2 operating location for the duration of the Cuban Missile Crisis. The film from Major Heyser's mission was developed, analyzed and the photos were shown to the United Nations Security Council on October 22, 1962, proving to the world, that offensive missiles were on the island of Cuba. Another 4080th pilot, Major Rudolf Anderson, Jr., perished when his U-2 was hit by shrapnel from a Soviet-made SA-2 on October 22, 1962, while overflying Cuba from McCoy AFB. While the U-2 did not suffer a direct hit, Anderson was struck by fragments from the proximity fused warhead's explosion which penetrated and compromised his pressure suit (at altitude, unconsciousness and death came very quickly). His body was returned to the U.S. following the crisis, still clad in its pressure suit. Major Anderson posthumously became the first recipient of the Air Force Cross. Laughlin's primary operations training complex, Anderson Hall, is named in his honor.1972, Main Gate  Air Training Command  In 1961, Headquarters US Air Force notified Laughlin officials their mission would expand to again include an Air Training Command undergraduate pilot training program. Plans called to transfer in about half the student load from Laredo Air Force Base, Texas. ATC reactivated the 3645th Pilot Training Wing (later redesignated 3646th Pilot Training Wing) at Laughlin in October 1961 to prepare for the phase-in of students and T-37 and T-33 trainers. The 4080th SW continued at Laughlin as a tenant organization until 1963. Today, aircraft flown at Laughlin include the T-6A Texan II, the T-38C Talon and T-1A Jayhawk.

The blood vessel supplying the affected area of tissue may be blocked due to an obstruction in the vessel (e.g., an arterial embolus, thrombus, or atherosclerotic plaque), compressed by something outside of the vessel causing it to narrow (e.g., tumor, volvulus, or hernia), ruptured by trauma causing a loss of blood pressure downstream of the rupture, or vasoconstricted, which is the narrowing of the blood vessel by contraction of the muscle wall rather than an external force (e.g., cocaine vasoconstriction leading to myocardial infarction).Infarction could be caused by damaged cholesterol plaque Hypertension and atherosclerosis are risk factors for both atherosclerotic plaques and thromboembolism. In atherosclerotic formations, a plaque develops under a fibrous cap. When the fibrous cap is degraded by metalloproteinases released from macrophages or by intravascular shear force from blood flow, subendothelial thrombogenic material (extracellular matrix) is exposed to circulating platelets and thrombus formation occurs on the vessel wall occluding blood flow. Occasionally, the plaque may rupture and form an embolus which travels with the blood-flow downstream to where the vessel narrows and eventually clogs the vessel lumen Classification Infarction of the lung due to a pulmonary embolism =By histopathology= A blood clot could be a broken thrombosis that got clotted to the blood vessel wall. Infarctions are divided into two types according to the amount of blood present: # White infarctions (anemic infarcts) affect solid organs such as the spleen, heart and kidneys wherein the solidity of the tissue substantially limits the amount of nutrients (blood/oxygen/glucose/fuel) that can flow into the area of ischaemic necrosis. Similar occlusion to blood flow and consequent necrosis can occur as a result of severe vasoconstriction as illustrated in severe Raynaud's phenomenon that can lead to irreversible gangrene. # Red infarctions (hemorrhagic infarcts) generally affect the lungs or other loose organs (testis, ovary, small intestines). The occlusion consists more of red blood cells and fibrin strands. Characteristics of red infarcts include: #* occlusion of a vein #* loose tissues that allow blood to collect in the infarcted zone #* tissues with a dual circulatory system (lung, small intestines) #* tissues previously congested from sluggish venous outflow #* reperfusion (injury) of previously ischemic tissue that is associated with reperfusion-related diseases, such as myocardial infarction, stroke (cerebral infarction), shock-resuscitation, replantation surgery, frostbite, burns, and organ transplantation. Micrograph of testis showing hemorrhagic infarction.H&E; stain. =By localization= * Heart: Myocardial infarction (MI), commonly known as a heart attack, is an infarction of the heart, causing some heart cells to die. This is most commonly due to occlusion (blockage) of a coronary artery following the rupture of a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque, which is an unstable collection of lipids (fatty acids) and white blood cells (especially macrophages) in the wall of an artery. The resulting ischemia (restriction in blood supply) and oxygen shortage, if left untreated for a sufficient period of time, can cause damage or kill heart muscle tissue (myocardium). * Brain: Cerebral infarction is the ischemic kind of stroke due to a disturbance in the blood vessels supplying blood to the brain. It can be atherothrombotic or embolic. Stroke caused by cerebral infarction should be distinguished from two other kinds of stroke: cerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cerebral infarctions vary in their severity with one third of the cases resulting in death. * Lung: Pulmonary infarction or lung infarction * Spleen: Splenic infarction occurs when the splenic artery or one of its branches are occluded, for example by a blood clot. Although it can occur asymptomatically, the typical symptom is severe pain in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, sometimes radiating to the left shoulder. Fever and chills develop in some cases. It has to be differentiated from other causes of acute abdomen. * Limb: Limb infarction is an infarction of an arm or leg. Causes include arterial embolisms and skeletal muscle infarction as a rare complication of long standing, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. A major presentation is painful thigh or leg swelling. * Bone: Infarction of bone results in avascular necrosis. Without blood, the bone tissue dies and the bone collapses. If avascular necrosis involves the bones of a joint, it often leads to destruction of the joint articular surfaces (see osteochondritis dissecans). * Testicle: an infarction of a testicle may be caused by testicular torsion. Ultrasound of segmental testicular infarction. Infarct area shown as hypoechoic and avascular upper segment of R testis. * Eye: an infarction can occur to the central retinal artery which supplies the retina causing sudden visual loss. *Bowel: Bowel infarction is generally caused by mesenteric ischemia due to blockages in the arteries or veins that supply the bowel. Associated diseases Diseases commonly associated with infarctions include: * Peripheral artery occlusive disease (the most severe form of which is gangrene) * Antiphospholipid syndrome * Sepsis * Giant-cell arteritis (GCA) * Hernia * Volvulus * Sickle-cell disease References  External links  Gross pathology Causes of death ","title":"Infarction"},{"id":"604143","text":"Saville is a surname.

He was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Columbia University, earning his AB (1920), AM (1921), and Ph.D. (1923) in English. After graduating from Columbia, Mabbott taught English literature and composition at Northwestern University. In 1928, he left Northwestern to teach at Brown. He was there for one year before accepting a position at Hunter College in New York City. Mabbott remained at Hunter as a professor of English and research scholar until 1966. His final two years were spent as a visiting professor at St. John's University. He may be best remembered as an expert on Edgar Allan Poe, whose works he was in the process of compiling when he died on May 15, 1968, at the age of 69. During his studies, he identified some poetry of Poe originally published anonymously as well as never published manuscripts. His wife took over the project after his death and saw it through to completion.

It was directed by Oliver Stone, and stars Val Kilmer as Morrison and Meg Ryan as Pamela Courson (Morrison's companion). The film features Kyle MacLachlan as keyboardist Ray Manzarek, Frank Whaley as guitarist Robby Krieger, Kevin Dillon as drummer John Densmore, and Kathleen Quinlan as journalist Patricia Kennealy. The film portrays Morrison as a larger-than-life icon of 1960s rock and roll and counterculture, including portrayals of Morrison's recreational drug use, free love, hippie lifestyle, alcoholism, interest in hallucinogenic drugs as entheogens, and, particularly, his growing obsession with death, presented as threads which weave in and out of the film. The Doors grossed $34 million worldwide against its $32 million production budget. Plot In 1949, young Jim Morrison and his family are traveling on a desert highway where they encounter an auto wreck and see an elderly Native American dying by the roadside. In 1965, Jim arrives in California and is assimilated into the Venice Beach culture. During his tenure studying at UCLA, he meets his future girlfriend Pamela Courson. He also meets Ray Manzarek for the first time, as well as Robby Krieger and John Densmore, all of whom form The Doors with Morrison. Jim convinces his bandmates to travel to Death Valley and experience the effects of psychedelic drugs. Returning to Los Angeles, they play several shows at the famous Whisky a Go Go nightclub and develop a rabid fanbase. Jim's onstage antics and lewd performance of the group's song \\"The End\\" upset the club's owners, and the band is ejected from the venue. After the show, they are approached by producer Paul A. Rothchild and Jac Holzman of Elektra Records and are offered a deal to record their first album. The Doors are soon invited to perform on The Ed Sullivan Show, only to be told by one of the producers that they must change the lyric \\"girl we couldn't get much higher\\" in the song \\"Light My Fire\\". Despite this, Morrison performs the original lyric during the live broadcast and the band is not allowed to perform on the show again. As the Doors' success continues, Jim becomes increasingly infatuated with his own image as \\"The Lizard King\\" and develops an addiction with alcoholism and drugs. Jim meets Patricia Kennealy, a rock journalist involved in witchcraft, and participates in mystical ceremonies with her, including a handfasting ceremony. Meanwhile, an elder spirit watches these events. The rest of the band grows weary of Jim's missed recording sessions and absences at concerts. Jim arrives late to a Miami, Florida concert, becoming increasingly confrontational towards the audience and allegedly exposing himself onstage. The incident is a low point for the band, resulting in criminal charges against Jim, cancellations of shows, breakdowns in Jim's personal relationships, and resentment from the other band members. In 1970, following a lengthy trial, Jim is found guilty of indecent exposure, and ordered to serve time in prison. However, he is allowed to remain free on bail, pending the results of an appeal. Patricia tells Jim that she is pregnant with his child, but Jim convinces her to have an abortion. Jim visits his bandmates for the final time, attending a party hosted by Ray where he wishes the band luck in their future endeavors and gives each of them a copy of his poetry book An American Prayer. As Jim plays in the front garden with the children, he sees that one of them is his childhood self and comments, \\"This is the strangest life I've ever known\\" (a lyric from his song \\"Waiting for the Sun\\"). In 1971, Jim and Pam move to Paris, France to escape the pressures of the L.A. lifestyle. One evening, Pam finds Jim dead in the bathtub of their apartment. The film's final scenes before the credits roll are of Jim's gravesite in P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, while \\"The Severed Garden (Adagio)\\" (from An American Prayer) plays in the background. Just before the closing credits, the screen whites out and text appears stating that \\"Jim Morrison is said to have died of heart failure. He was 27. Pam joined him three years later.\\" During the closing credits, the band is shown recording the song \\"L.A. Woman\\" in the studio. Cast Production =Development= Film directors Brian De Palma, Martin Scorsese and William Friedkin had all flirted with making a Doors biopic over the years.Riordan 1996, p. 308. In 1985, Columbia Pictures acquired the rights from the Doors and the Morrison estate to make a film. Producer Sasha Harari wanted filmmaker Oliver Stone to write the screenplay but never heard back from his agent. After two unsatisfactory scripts were produced, Imagine Films replaced Columbia. Harari contacted Stone again and the director met with the surviving band members, telling them he wanted to keep a particularly wild scene from one of the early drafts. The group was offended by this and exercised their right of approval over the director, rejecting Stone. By 1989, Mario Kassar and Andrew Vajna, who owned Carolco Pictures, had acquired the rights to the project and wanted Stone to direct it. The Doors had seen Stone's film Platoon (1986) and were impressed with what he had done,Riordan 1996, p. 310. and Stone agreed to make the film after his next project, Evita. After spending years working on Evita and courting both Madonna and Meryl Streep to play the titular role, the film fell apart over salary negotiations with Streep and Stone quickly moved into pre-production for The Doors. Guitarist Robby Krieger had always opposed a Doors biopic until Stone signed on to direct. Conversely, keyboardist Ray Manzarek had traditionally been the biggest advocate of immortalizing the band on film but opposed Stone's involvement. He was not happy with the direction that Stone was going to take with the film and refused to give his approval. According to actor Kyle MacLachlan, \\"I know that he and Oliver weren't speaking. I think it was hard for Ray, he being the keeper of the Doors myth for so long\\". According to Krieger, \\"when the Doors broke up Ray had his idea of how the band should be portrayed and John and I had ours\\". Manzarek stated that he was not asked to consult on the film and wanted it to be about all four band members equally, rather than the focus being on Morrison. Conversely, Stone stated that he repeatedly tried to get Manzarek involved, but \\"all he did was rave and shout. He went on for three hours about his point of view ... I didn't want Ray to be dominant, but Ray thought he knew better than anybody else\\".Riordan 1996, p. 312. =Screenplay= Stone first heard the Doors in 1967, when he was a 21-year- old soldier in Vietnam. Before filming started, Stone and his producers had to negotiate with the three surviving band members and their label, Elektra Records, as well as the parents of both Morrison and his girlfriend Pamela Courson. Morrison's parents would only allow themselves to be depicted in a dream-like flashback sequence at the beginning of the film. The Coursons wanted there to be no suggestion in any way that Pamela caused Morrison's death. Stone found the Coursons the most difficult to deal with because they wanted Pamela to be portrayed as \\"an angel\\". While researching the film, Stone read through transcripts of interviews with over 100 people. Stone finally penned the film script in the summer of 1989, later stating that \\"The Doors script was always problematic. Even when we shot, but the music helped fuse it together\\".Riordan 1996, p. 311. Stone first picked the songs he wanted to use and then wrote \\"each piece of the movie as a mood to fit that song\\". The Coursons did not like Stone's script and tried to slow the production down by refusing to allow any of Morrison's later poetry to be used in the film. (When Morrison died, Courson acquired the rights to Morrison's poetry; when she died, her parents got the rights.) =Casting= For nearly 10 years prior to production, the project went through development hell after being considered by many studios and directors. Several actors, including Tom Cruise, Johnny Depp, John Travolta and Richard Gere, were each considered for the role of Morrison when the project was still in development in the 1980s, with Bono of U2 and Michael Hutchence of INXS also expressing interest in the role. Stone initially offered the role to Ian Astbury of The Cult, who declined the role because he was not happy with the way Morrison was represented in the film. When Stone began talking about the project in 1988, he had Val Kilmer in mind to play Morrison, after seeing him in the Ron Howard fantasy film Willow. Kilmer had the same kind of singing voice as Morrison and, to convince Stone that he was right for the role, spent several thousand dollars of his own money and made his own eight-minute audition video, singing and looking like Morrison at various stages of his life. To prepare for the role, Kilmer lost weight and spent six months rehearsing Doors songs every day; the actor learned 50 songs, 15 of which are actually performed in the film. Kilmer also spent hundreds of hours with the Doors' producer Paul A. Rothchild, who related \\"anecdotes, stories, tragic moments, humorous moments, how Jim thought ... interpretation of Jim's lyrics\\". Rothchild also took Kilmer into the studio and helped him with \\"some pronunciations, idiomatic things that Jim would do that made the song sound like Jim\\". Kilmer also met with Krieger and Densmore but Manzarek refused to talk to him. When the Doors heard Kilmer singing they could not tell whether the voice was Kilmer's or Morrison's.Riordan 1996, p. 314. Stone auditioned approximately 60 actresses for the role of Pamela Courson.Riordan 1996, p. 316. The role required nudity and the script featured sex scenes, which generated a fair amount of controversy. Casting director Risa Bramon felt that Patricia Arquette auditioned very well and should have gotten the role. To prepare for the role, Meg Ryan talked to the Coursons and people that knew Pamela. Before doing the film, she was not familiar with Morrison and \\"liked a few songs\\", adding, \\"I had to reexamine all my beliefs about [the 1960s] in order to do this movie\\".Riordan 1996, p. 322. In doing research, she also encountered several conflicting views of Pamela. Krieger acted as a technical advisor on the film, chiefly to show his cinematic alter ego, Frank Whaley, where to put his fingers on the guitar fretboard during the mimed performance sequences. Similarly, Densmore also acted as a consultant on the film, tutoring Kevin Dillon. =Principal photography= With a budget set at $32 million, The Doors was filmed over 13 weeks, predominantly in and around Los Angeles, California; Paris, France; New York City, New York; and the Mojave Desert.Riordan 1996, p. 317. Stone originally hired Paula Abdul to choreograph the film's concert scenes, who dropped out of the project because she did not understand Morrison's on-stage actions and was not familiar with the time period. Abdul recommended Bill and Jacqui Landrum, who watched hours of concert footage before working with Kilmer and got him to do dance exercises to loosen up his upper body and jumping routines to develop his stamina. During the concert scenes, Kilmer did his own singing, performing over the Doors' master tapes without Morrison's lead vocals, avoiding lip- synching.Riordan 1996, p. 318. Kilmer's endurance was put to the test during the concert sequences, which took several days to film, with Stone stating \\"his voice would start to deteriorate after two or three takes. We had to take that into consideration\\". One sequence, filmed inside the Whisky a Go Go, proved to be more difficult than others due to all the smoke and sweat, a result of the body heat and intense camera lights. \\"The End\\" sequence took five days to shoot, spanning 24 takes for Stone to get what he wanted, after which Kilmer was completely exhausted. Controversy arose during filming when a memo linked to Kilmer circulated among cast and crew members, listing rules of how the actor was to be treated for the duration of principal photography.Riordan 1996, p. 326. These provisions forbade people to approach him on set without good reason, address him by his own name while he was in character or stare at him on set. An upset Stone contacted Kilmer's agent and the actor claimed it was all a huge misunderstanding and that the memo was for his own people and not the film crew. Soundtrack The film contains over two dozen of the Doors' songs, although only half of these appear on the accompanying soundtrack album. In the film, original recordings of the band are combined with vocal performances by Kilmer himself, although none of Kilmer's performances appear on the soundtrack album. In addition, two songs by The Velvet Underground (\\"Heroin\\" and \\"Venus in Furs\\"), are also heard throughout the film, with the former appearing on the soundtrack.The Doors (1991) - Trivia Historical accuracy The film is based mostly on real people and actual events, with some segments reflecting Stone's vision and dramatization of those people and events. For example, when Morrison is asked to change the infamous lyric in \\"Light My Fire\\" for his appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, he is depicted as blatantly ignoring their request, defiantly shouting the words \\"higher! Yeah!\\" into the television camera. However, during the actual broadcast, Morrison had simply sung the vocal with the same emphasis as on the record. Morrison later said the inclusion of \\"higher\\" in the live version was an accident, and that he had meant to change the lyric but was so nervous about performing on live television that he simply forgot to change it. Conversely, Ray Manzarek said the Doors only pretended to agree to the changing of words and deliberately played the song as they always had, albeit without any added emphasis on the offending word. Furthermore, for The Ed Sullivan Show performance, Kilmer as Morrison is shown wearing a black shirt, despite having worn a white shirt and black leather jacket for his actual performance on the show in September 1967. Another inaccuracy can be found in the character of a seductive female magazine photographer played by Mimi Rogers, who appears to be based on 16 magazine editor Gloria Stavers. (The dialogue in this scene is based on a conversation Stavers had with Morrison during a photo session in her Manhattan apartment.) This character is portrayed as having taken the famous \\"young lion\\" picture of Jim Morrison in New York City in 1967, when in fact this particular photograph (as well as nearly all the other publicity photographs for the Doors' first album) were taken by a male photographer, Joel Brodsky, in Los Angeles in November 1966. Several acts of violence portrayed in the film are also disputed: Morrison is depicted as locking Pamela Courson in a closet and setting it on fire; having a violent argument with Courson at a Thanksgiving celebration, where they both threaten each other with a knife; and angrily throwing a television set at Manzarek for licensing the use of \\"Light My Fire\\" in a Buick television commercial.According to Manzarek, among others Chat with Ray Manzarek 11/17/97 Even though Manzarek was frank about Morrison's tendency to go into senseless rages,Manzarek, Light My Fire, p. 180, 205-207, 305-308. participants in the film agree that Stone took many liberties in fabricating events and that none of these incidents actually occurred. Dialogue from Kennealy that took place between her and Morrison is reassigned to Courson, and Courson is depicted as saying hostile things to Kennealy, when by all reports their interactions were polite. Kennealy is also portrayed as being the girl Morrison was with in the shower stall backstage before the December 9, 1967 New Haven concert, when in fact he was having a conversation with a local teenage co-ed from Southern Connecticut State University. Additionally, the New Haven venue is presented in the film as a gorgeous amphitheater with a large balcony and a packed audience, when in reality it was a rather decrepit, half-empty hockey rink with audience members sitting on foldable wooden chairs. Similarly, in an earlier scene of a press conference set in New York City in 1967, when Kennealy is first introduced to Morrison, the singer is asked a question regarding \\"the dreadful reviews your new poetry book has received\\"; at that time, Morrison had not yet published any volumes of his poetry. John Densmore is portrayed as hating Morrison when the singer's personal and drug problems begin to dominate his behavior. However, Densmore states in his biography Riders on the Storm that he never directly confronted Morrison about his behavior. Other questionable portrayals include those of Andy Warhol, who is presented as a leering homosexual caricature. Krieger, Densmore and Kennealy are all credited as technical advisors for the film; however, they have all commented that, although they may have given advice, Stone often chose to ignore it in favor of his own vision of the story. The settings for the film, particularly the concert sequences, are depicted in mostly chronological order, although the crowd scenes contain many blatant exaggerations, such as portrayals of public nudity, bonfires, and group revelries that did not occur. In the film's climactic scene of the infamous concert at the Dinner Key Auditorium in Miami on March 1, 1969, Morrison is shown as leaving the stage to join the audience for a singalong medley of \\"Break on Through\\" and \\"Dead Cats, Dead Rats\\", a portrayal which is likewise exaggerated and inaccurate. Also, prior to the concert, a reporter on the scene makes a derogatory comment about the band's fourth studio album, The Soft Parade, which had not yet been completed and would not be released until July of that year. The surviving Doors members were all, to one degree or another, unhappy with the final film, and were said to have heavily criticized Stone's portrayal of Morrison as an \\"out of control sociopath.\\" In a 1991 interview with Gary James, Manzarek criticized Stone for exaggerating Morrison's alcohol consumption in the movie: \\"Jim with a bottle all the time. It was ridiculous . . . It was not about Jim Morrison. It was about Jimbo Morrison, the drunk. God, where was the sensitive poet and the funny guy? The guy I knew was not on that screen.\\"Interview with Ray Manzarek at Classic Bands In the afterword of his book Riders on the Storm, Densmore says that the movie is based on \\"the myth of Jim Morrison\\" and criticizes the film for portraying Morrison's ideas as \\"muddled through the haze of the drink [alcohol].\\" In a 1994 interview, Krieger said that the film doesn't give the viewer \\"any kind of understanding of what made Jim Morrison tick.\\" Krieger added, \\"They left a lot of stuff out. Some of it was overblown, but a lot of the stuff was very well done, I thought.\\" In the book The Doors, Manzarek says, \\"that Oliver Stone thing did real damage to the guy I knew: Jim Morrison, the poet\\", while Densmore says, \\"a third of it's fiction.\\" Krieger joins Manzarek and Densmore in describing the movie as inaccurate, but adds that \\"it could have been a lot worse.\\" In Manzarek's biography of the Doors, Light My Fire, he often criticizes Stone and also includes myriad details that discredit Stone's account of Morrison. For example, in Stone's \\"re-creation\\" of Morrison's student film at UCLA, he has Morrison watching a D-Day sequence on television and shouting profanities in German, with a near-nude German exchange student dancing on top of the television sporting a swastika armband. According to Manzarek, the only similarity between Stone's version and Morrison's was that the girl in question was indeed German.Manzarek, Light My Fire, p. 55-57 As the credits point out and as Stone emphasizes in his DVD commentary, some characters, names, and incidents in the film are fictitious or amalgamations of real people. In the 1997 documentary, The Road of Excess, Stone states that Quinlan's character, Patricia Kennealy, is a composite, and in retrospect should have been given a fictitious name. Kennealy in particular was hurt by her portrayal in the film and strongly objected to a scene in the film where Morrison states that he did not take their Wiccan marriage ceremony seriously. Ryan's character, Pamela Courson, involves liberties of a different sort. The former Doors do not think the movie depiction of her is very accurate, as their book The Doors describes the version of Courson in the movie as \\"a cartoon of a girlfriend\\". Courson's parents had inherited Morrison's poems when their daughter died, and Stone had to agree to restrictions about his portrayal of her in exchange for the rights to use the poetry. In particular, Stone agreed to avoid any suggestion that Courson may have been responsible for Morrison's death. However, Alain Ronay and Courson herself had both said that she was responsible. In Riders on the Storm, Densmore says Courson said she felt terribly guilty because she had obtained drugs that she believed had either caused or contributed to Morrison's death. Release and reception The film was also entered into the 17th Moscow International Film Festival. According to Q magazine, \\"few people emerged from seeing the film having raised their opinions of that band and especially its singer Jim Morrison.\\" The problem, as critic Keith Cameron put it, was not so much that \\"Stone dwelled upon Morrison the inebriate, the philanderer, or the pretentious Lizard King\\" but rather the \\"clich√©d Hollywood devices for sucking the wonder from the pioneering band: actors with fake hair saying silly things...\\" and \\"a self-important director's turgid attempts to make grand statements about America.\\"Cameron, Keith. Q magazine. 2010. October issue. Review Music DVDs. The Doors. When You're Strange. p.134. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 57% approval rating based on 60 reviews and an average rating of 6.01/10. The site's consensus states: \\"Val Kilmer delivers a powerhouse performance as one of rock's most incendiary figures, but unfortunately, Oliver Stone is unable to shed much light on the circus surrounding the star.\\" Metacritic reports a 62 out of 100 rating, based on 19 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews.\\" Rolling Stone gave the film four out of four stars.\\"The Doors\\" (review) Rolling Stone (March 1, 1991) In April 2019, a restored version of the film was selected to be shown in the Cannes Classics section at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival.

G.; Dictionary of the Car (Nicobarese) language; published 1925 by American Baptist Mission Press; pp. xxvi-xxxii) is found on small islands and in coastal regions from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India, east through the Malay Archipelago, to the Solomons and Palau. It is the only living member of the genus Caloenas and may be the closest living relative of the extinct dodo, and the extinct Rodrigues solitaire. Taxonomy In 1738, the English naturalist Eleazar Albin included a description and two illustrations of the Nicobar pigeon in his A Natural History of Birds. When in 1758 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the tenth edition, he placed the Nicobar pigeon with all the other pigeons in the genus Columba. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Columba nicobarica and cited Albin's work. The species is now placed in the genus Caloenas that was introduced by the English zoologist George Robert Gray in 1840 with the Nicobar pigeon as the type species. Two subspecies are recognised: * C. n. nicobarica (Linnaeus, 1758) ‚Äì Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Malay Archipelago to New Guinea, Philippines and Solomon Islands * C. n. pelewensis Finsch, 1875 ‚Äì Palau Island Based on cladistic analysis of mtDNA cytochrome b and 12S rRNA sequences, the Nicobar pigeon is sometimes called the closest living relative of the extinct didines (Raphinae), which include the famous dodo (Raphus cucullatus). However, the study's results showed this as one weak possibility from a limited sample of taxa. In any case, nDNA Œ≤-fibrinogen intron 7 sequence data agrees with the idea of the Raphinae as a subfamily of pigeons (and not an independent family, as was previously believed due to their bizarre apomorphies) that was part of a diverse Indopacific radiation, to which the Nicobar pigeon also belongs. The following cladogram, from Shapiro and colleagues (2002), shows the Nicobar pigeon's closest relationships within Columbidae, a clade consisting of generally ground-dwelling island endemics. Painting by Henrik Gr√∂nvold A similar cladogram was published in 2007, differing only in the inverted placement of Goura and Didunculus, as well as in the inclusion of the pheasant pigeon and the thick-billed ground pigeon at the base of the clade. C. nicobarica is a quite singular columbiform (though less autapomorphic than the flightless Raphinae), as are for example the tooth-billed pigeon (Didunculus strigirostris) and the crowned pigeons (Goura), which are typically considered distinct subfamilies. Hence, the Nicobar pigeon may well constitute another now-monotypic subfamily. And while any of the semi-terrestrial pigeons of Southeast Asia and the Wallacea cannot be excluded as possible closest living relative of the Raphinae, the Nicobar pigeon makes a more plausible candidate than for example the group of imperial-pigeons and fruit-doves, which seems to be part of the same radiation. Whether it is possible to clarify such deep-time phylogenies without a comprehensive study of all major lineages of living Columbidae remains to be seen. The primitive molecular clock used to infer the date the ancestors of the Nicobar pigeon and the didines diverged has since turned out to be both unreliable and miscalibrated. But what little evidence is available still suggests that the Nicobar pigeon is distinct from all other living lifeforms since the Paleogene ‚Äì most likely some time between 56-34 million years ago during the Eocene, which makes up the bulk of the Paleogene period. From subfossil bones found on New Caledonia and Tonga, an extinct species of Caloenas, the Kanaka pigeon (C. canacorum) was described. It was about one- quarter larger than the Nicobar pigeon. Considering that it must have been a good source of food, it was most likely hunted to extinction by the first human settlers of its home islands. It probably was extinct by 500 BC. The Spotted green pigeon (C. maculata) is a more recently extinct species from an unknown Pacific locality; it probably disappeared in the 19th century and most likely succumbed to introduced European rats. It is placed in Caloenas as the least awkward possibility; its true affinities are presently indeterminate and it is perhaps more likely to represent a distinct genus of the Indopacific radiation of Columbidae.Fuller (2000): p. 174‚Äì175. Description An adult at the Milwaukee County Zoological Gardens with iridescent scapulars It is a large pigeon, measuring in length. The head is grey, like the upper neck plumage, which turns into green and copper hackles. The tail is very short and pure white. The rest of its plumage is metallic green. The cere of the dark bill forms a small blackish knob; the strong legs and feet are dull red. The irides are dark.Grimmett et al. (2009). Females are slightly smaller than males; they have a smaller bill knob, shorter hackles and browner underparts. Immature birds have a black tail and lack almost all iridescence. There is hardly any variation across the birds' wide range. Even the Palau subspecies C. n. pelewensis has merely shorter neck hackles, but is otherwise almost identical. It is a very vocal species, giving a low-pitched repetitive call. Distribution and habitat Close up of the head On the Nicobar Islands (which are referred to in its common and scientific names), the most significant colony in our time was found on Batti Malv, a remote wildlife sanctuary between Car Nicobar and Teressa. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami caused massive damage on the Nicobar Islands, and it is still not quite clear to what extent Batti Malv was affected. But while everything on some islets in the Great Nicobar Biosphere Reserve was destroyed, Batti Malv lighthouse ‚Äì a skeletal tower a dozen metres high, standing a few metres ASL at the highest point of the low-lying island ‚Äì was little-damaged and put back in operation by the survey ship INS Sandhayak less than one month after the disaster. An April 2007 survey by the Indian Coast Guard vessel ICGS Vikram found the lighthouse tower \\"totally covered\\" in vines, indicating rampant regeneration of vegetation ‚Äì but perhaps also that damage to the island's forest was severe, as a cover of creeping plants is typical of early succession stages, while a photo of the lighthouse taken before the tsunami shows rather mature forest.Sankaran (1998), IHMDN (2005), ICG (2007), Rowlett (2008). =Found in Australia= A Nicobar pigeon was found by the Bardi Jawi Indigenous rangers on the Dampier Peninsula in the western Kimberley, Australia in May 2017. As part of biosecurity measures, it was reported to quarantine services was removed by Australian Department of Agriculture officials. Behaviour and ecology The Nicobar pigeon's breeding range encompasses the Andaman and Nicobar Islands of India, the Mergui Archipelago of Myanmar, offshore islands of south-western Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, southern Cambodia and Vietnam, and many of the small islands between Sumatra, the Philippines and the Solomon Islands. On Palau, the only distinct subspecies C. n. pelewensis is found. The white tail is the most conspicuous feature of adult Nicobar pigeons, particularly when seen at a distance in the twilight. The Nicobar pigeon roams in flocks from island to island, usually sleeping on offshore islets where no predators occur and spends the day in areas with better food availability, not shying away from areas inhabited by humans. Its food consists of seeds, fruit and buds, and it is attracted to areas where grain is available. A gizzard stone helps to grind up hard food items. Its flight is quick, with regular beats and an occasional sharp flick of the wings, as is characteristic of pigeons in general. Unlike other pigeons, groups tend to fly in columns or single file, not in a loose flock. The white tail is prominent in flight when seen from behind and may serve as a sort of \\"taillight\\", keeping flocks together when crossing the sea at dawn or dusk. The young birds' lack of a white tail is a signal of their immaturity clearly visible to conspecifics ‚Äì to an adult Nicobar pigeon, it is obvious at a glance which flockmembers are neither potential mates, nor potential competitors for mates, nor old enough to safely guide a flock from one island to another. This species nests in dense forest on offshore islets, often in large colonies. It builds a loose stick nest in a tree. It lays one elliptical faintly blue-tinged white egg. In 2017, several individual Caloenas nicobarica were sighted in the Kimberley region of Western Australia with a juvenile captured at Ardyaloon (One Arm Point), near Broome - the first time the bird has been sighted on the Australian mainland. Nicobar pigeon in a U.S. zoo Conservation Nicobar pigeon at Munich Zoo Hellabrunn Nicobar pigeons are hunted in considerable numbers for food, and also for their gizzard stone which is used in jewellery. The species is also trapped for the local pet market, but as it is on CITES Appendix I, such trade is generally illegal. Internationally, captive breeding is able to supply the birds demanded by zoos, where this attractive and unusual bird is often seen. Direct exploitation of the species, even including the illegal trade, might be sustainable on its own; however, its available nesting habitat is decreasing. The offshore islets which it requires are often logged for plantations, destroyed by construction activity, or polluted by nearby industry or harbours. Also, increased travel introduces predators to more and more of the breeding sites, and colonies of the Nicobar pigeon may be driven to desert such locations or be destroyed outright. Though the bird is widely distributed and in some locations very common \\\\--even on small Palau it is still reasonably plentiful, with an estimated 1,000 adult birds remaining‚Äîits long-term future is increasingly jeopardized. For these reasons, the IUCN considers C. nicobarica a near threatened species.BLI (2009). References Sources * Fuller, Errol (2000): Extinct Birds (2nd ed.).

Entering service in 1961, Dido was involved in the Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation, served with NATO's Standing Naval Force Atlantic on several occasions, and was one of the frigates used for the filming of the drama series Warship. Following a defence review at the start of the 1980s, the ship was transferred to the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN), and was recommissioned as HMNZS Southland. Southland remained in service until 1995. After decommissioning the frigate was towed to the Philippines where her boilers were removed, and then sent to India for scrapping. Construction Dido was built by Yarrow of Glasgow. She was laid down as a to be called Hastings on 2 December 1959, but in 1960, it was decided to complete the ship as one of the new Leander class, with the new name Dido.Osborne and Sowdon 1990, pp. 32, 109. The naming ceremony for Dido took place on 21 December 1961, but her launch was delayed until the next day because of fog.Osborne and Sowdon 1990, p. 33. Dido was commissioned on 18 September 1963.

A twin 4.5-inch (113 mm) Mark 6 gun mount was fitted forward. While the Leander-class was planned to be fitted with the Sea Cat surface-to-air missile, Dido was completed with two Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft guns as a temporary substitute until Sea Cat could be fitted. A Limbo anti-submarine mortar was fitted aft to provide a short-range anti- submarine capability, while a hangar and helicopter deck allowed a single Westland Wasp helicopter to be operated, for longer range anti-submarine and anti-surface operations.Osborne and Sowdon 1990, pp. 33‚Äì34. As built, Dido was fitted with a large Type 965 long range air search radar on the ship's mainmast, with a Type 993 short range air/surface target indicating radar and Type 974 navigation radar carried on the ship's foremast. An MRS3 fire control system was carried to direct the 4.5-inch guns.Osborne and Sowden 1990, pp. 33, 35. The ship had a sonar suite of Type 177 medium range search sonar, Type 162 bottom search and Type 170 attack sonar, together with a Type 199 variable depth sonar (VDS).

The ship was one of four used as the fictional frigate HMS Hero in the 1970s BBC television drama series Warship. Dido after her Ikara system conversion, c1978 Dido was extensively refitted at Devonport between July 1975 and October 1978, as a Batch 1B Ikara conversion (and the last to be completed),Osborne and Sowdon 1990, pp. 57‚Äì58, 109. at a cost of ¬£23,000,000.Osborne and Sowdon 1990, p. 45. An Ikara ASW missile launcher replaced the 4.5-inch turret, while two Sea Cat launchers were fitted to the hangar roof. The two Bofors guns were retained but moved forward to abreast the ship's mainmast. The Limbo anti-submarine mortar and Wasp helicopter was retained. The long-range Type 965 radar was removed, with improved navigation and target indicating radars fitted, and the ADAWS 5 computer aided combat direction system added to direct Ikara operations. The ship's sonar suite remained unchanged.Osborne and Sowdon 1990, pp. 55‚Äì57, 111. After working up following the refit, Dido joined the 3rd Frigate Squadron. In 1983 the ship was briefly assigned again to the Standing Naval Force Atlantic (STANAVFORLANT). Royal New Zealand Navy Service As a result of the 1981 Defence Review, which had recommended the disposal of some older frigates, the ship was sold to the RNZN, along with sister ship .

Bradley. Defending NZ. Listener, Sept 1982 Southland received a five-month, $15 million refit at Vosper Thornycroft after recommissioning on 18 July 1983 as HMNZS Southland. During the refit the Limbo mortar and VDS were removed as were the associated 170 and 199 sonars, while US Mk 32 torpedo tubes for anti-submarine torpedoes were fitted. The refit was completed in late December 1983 and over the following months, Southland had several workups at Portland and participated in a number of Royal Navy and NATO exercises before sailing for New Zealand in mid-1984. An earlier already had historical links with Southland. Decommissioning and fate Around 1986 extensive plans were drawn up for a major refit of Southland which would have allowed its Ikara capability to remain operational until the mid-1990s. The RN had significantly modernised one of its remaining Ikara Leanders, at the time with long range 2031 towed array capable of passive detection in the 160 km + range zone. The Royal Australian Navy planned to continue with its similar, but incompatible, Ikara system for a while. However quotes for refitting Southland in UK yards or at Lyttleton proved high, the Cold War effectively ended in 1989 and with the RN and USN withdrawing its stock of nuclear depth charges, (the intended warhead option for RN Ikara Leanders to attack Soviet submarines at range, where two directional sound transmission times were probably too great for accurate proximity direction of Ikara carrying MK 46 torpedoes) meant Ikara was no longer useful to the Royal Navy. As a result, the Ikara system was withdrawn from RNZN use in 1989 with space found for a low cost refit at the RNZN dockyard for it to continue as a General Purpose frigate until 1993. Decommissioned in 1995, Southland was towed away by two patrol craft to the Philippines where her boilers were removed for a rubber plantation. She was then towed to Singapore where she was sold to an Indian tug company who took her to Goa beach in India. She was pulled up on the beach and her parts were sold.

The spotted green pigeon, another extinct species from an unknown locality, has only a slightly similarity to the Nicobar pigeon due to its neck feathers. Ornithologists place it in this genus, but there is not a unanimous agreement. One surviving specimen exists in the Liverpool Museum.

Early life and career Paul Pelliot was born on 28 May 1878 in Paris, France, and initially intended to pursue a career as a foreign diplomat. Accordingly, he studied English as a secondary school student at La Sorbonne, then studied Mandarin Chinese at the √âcole des Langues Orientales Vivantes (School of Living Oriental Languages). Pelliot was a gifted student, and completed the school's three-year Mandarin course in only two years. His rapid progress and accomplishments attracted the attention of the Sinologist √âdouard Chavannes, the chair of Chinese at the Coll√®ge de France, who befriended Pelliot and began mentoring him. Chavannes also introduced Pelliot to the Coll√®ge's Sanskrit chair, Sylvain L√©vi. Pelliot began studying under the two men, who encouraged him to pursue a scholarly career instead of a diplomatic one. In early 1900, Pelliot moved to Hanoi to take up a position as a research scholar at the √âcole Fran√ßaise d'Extr√™me- Orient (EFEO, \\"French School of the Far East\\"). In February of that year, Pelliot was sent to Peking (modern Beijing) to locate and buy Chinese books for the school's library. Between July and August 1900, Pelliot was caught up in the siege of the foreign legations during the Boxer Rebellion. At one point, during a ceasefire, Pelliot made a daring one-man foray to the rebels' headquarters, where he used his boldness and fluency in Mandarin to impress the besiegers into giving him fresh fruit for those inside the legation. For his conduct during the siege, as well as for capturing an enemy flag during the fighting, he was awarded the L√©gion d'Honneur upon his return to Hanoi. In 1901, when only 23 years old, Pelliot was made a professor of Chinese at the EFEO. Pelliot stayed in Hanoi until 1904, when he returned to France in preparation for representing the EFEO at the 1905 International Conference of Orientalists in Algiers. While in France, Pelliot was chosen to direct a government-sponsored archaeological mission to Chinese Turkestan (modern Xinjiang). The group departed in June 1906 and spent several years in the field (see below). By the time the expedition reached Dunhuang, Pelliot had learned Mongolian, Arabic, Persian, the Turkic languages, Tibetan, and Sanskrit, among others, which proved invaluable while examining the many non- Chinese items among the Dunhuang manuscripts inside the Mogao caves. Central Asia expedition Mission Pelliot route Pelliot's expedition left Paris on 17 June 1906. His three-man team included Dr. Louis Vaillant, an Army medical officer, and Charles Nouette, a photographer. Aboard the train in Samarkand, the Frenchmen met Baron Gustaf Mannerheim, a colonel in the Russian Imperial Army and the last Tsarist agent in the Great Game. Pelliot had agreed to allow the army officer, disguised as an ethnographic collector, to travel with his expedition. Mannerheim was actually carrying out a secret mission for Tsar Nicholas II to collect intelligence on the reform and modernization of the Qing Dynasty. The Tsar was assessing the possibility of a Russian invasion of Western China. Pelliot fully endorsed Mannerheim's participation, and even offered himself as an informant to the Russian General Staff. In return, the Frenchman demanded free passage on the Trans-Caspian Railway, a personal and confidential payment of ten thousand francs and a Cossack escort. These were granted, and the payment even doubled. Pelliot examines manuscripts in the Mogao Caves (1908) The expedition traveled to Chinese Turkestan by rail through Moscow and Tashkent to Andijan, where they mounted horses and carts to Osh. From here, they travelled across the Alai Mountains of southern Kyrgyzstan over the Taldyk Pass and Irkeshtam Pass to China. Near the town of Gulcha, the expedition met Kurmanjan Datka, the famed Muslim Queen of Alai and posed for a photograph with her. Mannerheim and Pelliot did not get along, and parted ways two days after leaving Irkeshtam Pass. The French team arrived in Kashgar at the end of August, staying with the Russian consul-general (the successor to Nikolai Petrovsky). Pelliot amazed the local Chinese officials with his fluent Chinese (only one of the 13 languages he spoke). His efforts were to pay off shortly, when his team began obtaining supplies (like a yurt) previously considered unobtainable. His first stop after leaving Kashgar was Tumxuk. From there, he proceeded to Kucha, where he found documents in the lost language of Kuchean. These documents were later translated by Sylvain L√©vi, Pelliot's former teacher. After Kucha, Pelliot went to √úr√ºmqi, where they encountered Duke Lan, whose brother had been a leader of the Boxer Rebellion. Duke Lan, who was the deputy chief of the Peking gendarmerie and participated in the siege, was in permanent exile in √úr√ºmqi. In √úr√ºmqi, Pelliot heard about a find of manuscripts at the Silk Road oasis of Dunhuang from Duke Lan. The two had a bittersweet reunion. Pelliot had been in the French legation in Peking while Duke Lan and his soldiers were besieging the foreigners during the Boxer Rebellion. They reminisced about old times and drank champagne. Duke Lan also presented Pelliot with a sample Dunhuang manuscript. Recognizing its antiquity and archaeological value, Pelliot quickly set off for Dunhuang, but arrived there months after the Hungarian- British explorer Aurel Stein had already visited the site. At Dunhuang, Pelliot managed to gain access to Abbot Wang's secret chamber, which contained a massive hoard of medieval manuscripts. Stein had first seen the manuscripts in 1907 and had purchased a large number of them. However, Stein had no knowledge of the Chinese language, and had no way to be selective in which documents he purchased and took back to Britain. Pelliot, on the other hand, had an extensive command of Classical Chinese and numerous other Central Asian languages, and spent three weeks during April 1908 examining manuscripts at breakneck speed. Pelliot selected what he felt were the most valuable of the manuscripts, and Wang, who was interested in continuing the refurbishment of his monastery, agreed to sell them to Pelliot for a price of 500 taels (roughly equivalent to US $11,000 in 2014). The return and later years Pelliot in 1909 Pelliot returned to Paris on 24 October 1909 to a vicious smear campaign mounted against himself and √âdouard Chavannes. While at Dunhuang, Pelliot had written a detailed account of some of the most valuable documents he had found and mailed it back to Europe, where it was published upon its arrival. In the report, Pelliot included extensive biographical and textual data and precise dates from many of the manuscripts, which he had examined for only a few minutes each and then later recalled their details from memory while writing his report. This intellectual feat was so astonishing that many who were unfamiliar with Pelliot and his prodigious memory believed he had faked all the manuscripts and written his report from a library full of reference books. Pelliot was publicly accused of wasting public money and returning with forged manuscripts. This campaign came to a head with a December 1910 article in La Revue Indig√®ne by Fernand Farjenel (d. 1918) of the Coll√®ge libre des sciences sociales. At a banquet on 3 July 1911, Pelliot struck Farjenel, and a court case followed. These charges were not proven false until Hungarian-British explorer Aurel Stein's book, Ruins of Desert Cathay, appeared in 1912. In his book, Stein supported Pelliot's accounts and made it clear that he had left manuscripts behind in Dunhuang after his visit, vindicating Pelliot and silencing his critics. In 1911, as recognition of Pelliot's broad and unique scholarship, the Coll√®ge de France made him a professor and created a special chair for him: the Chair of the Languages, History, and Archaeology of Central Asia. The chair was never filled after Pelliot's death, leaving him the only person to have ever held it. In 1920, Pelliot joined Henri Cordier as co-editor of the preeminent sinological journal T'oung Pao, serving until 1942. After Cordier's death in 1924, Pelliot edited T'oung Pao alone until he was joined by Dutch sinologist J. J. L. Duyvendak in 1932. Pelliot served as French military attach√© in Beijing during World War I. He died of cancer in 1945.

Aepinus is best known for his researches, theoretical and experimental, in electricity and magnetism. Life He was born at Rostock in the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. He was descended from Johannes Aepinus (1499‚Äì1553), the first to adopt the Greek form (Œ±·º∞œÄŒµŒπŒΩœåœÇ) of the family name Hugk or Huck, and a leading theologian and controversialist at the time of the Protestant Reformation. After studying medicine for a time, Franz Aepinus devoted himself to the physical and mathematical sciences, in which he soon gained such distinction that he was admitted a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences. In 1755 he was briefly the director of the Astronomisches Rechen-Institut. In 1757 he settled in St Petersburg as member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and professor of physics, and remained there till his retirement in 1798. The rest of his life was spent at Dorpat. He enjoyed the favor of Empress Catherine II of Russia, who appointed him tutor to her son Paul, and endeavoured, without success, to establish normal schools throughout the empire under his direction. In 1761, Aepinus was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1764, he was appointed as a head of the cryptographic service of Russia, and held this position till 1797, during 33 years. Works Title page of his 1759 book His principal work, Tentamen Theoriae Electricitatis et Magnetismi (An Attempt at a Theory of Electricity and Magnetism), published at St Petersburg in 1759, was the first systematic attempt to apply mathematical reasoning to these subjects. He also published a treatise, in 1761, De Distributione Caloris per Tellurem (On the Distribution of Heat in the Earth), and he was the author of memoirs on different subjects in astronomy, mechanics, optics and pure mathematics, contained in the journals of the learned societies of St Petersburg and Berlin. His discussion of the effects of parallax in the transit of a planet over the sun's disc excited great interest, having appeared (in 1764) between the dates of the two transits of Venus that took place in the 18th century. Electrical theories Aepinus and Henry Cavendish devised theories of electricity which were essentially the same, yet had been framed without any communication between these two philosophers. Aepinus however published his theory about ten years before that of Cavendish. These are essentially modern theories which eventually put to rest the idea of two fluids. Aepinus gravestone in Raadi cemetery, Tartu, Estonia Their theories said that * ... the electric fluid is a substance, the particles of which repel each other, and attract the particles of all other matter, with a force inversely as the square of distance. [the square law was added later] * The particles of all other matter also repel each other, and attract those of the electric fluid with a force varying according to the same law. Or, if we consider the electric fluid as matter different from all other matter, the particles of all matter, both those of the electric fluid, and of other matter, repel particles of the same kind, and attract those of a contrary kind, with a force inversely as the square of the distance. Cavendish and Aepinus believed that the electric fluid was * another sort of matter. ... Its weight in any body probably bears a very small proportion to the weight of the matter in the body, but yet the force with which the electric fluid in any body attracts any particle of matter in that body, must be equal to the force with which the matter of the body repels that particle, otherwise the body would appear electrical, as will afterwards appear. In effect, they are imagining the 'electric fluid' as consisting of electrons with almost no mass, but still with substantial electrical attractive and repulsive power. Static electricity then becomes a matter of a superabundance of electrons in one body, and a shortage of electrons in another.

Most notably hadith accounts about the Isra and Mi'raj recounts that the Buraq carried the Islamic prophet Muhammad from Mecca to Jerusalem and up in the heavens and back by night.  Etymology  The Encyclopaedia of Islam, referring to Al-Damiri's writings, considers Buraq to be a derivative and adjective of barq \\"lightning/ emitted lightning\\" or various general meanings stemming from the verb: \\"to beam, flash, gleam, glimmer, glisten, glitter, radiate, shimmer, shine, sparkle, twinkle\\".Gruber, Christane J., \\"al-BurƒÅq\\", in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, THREE, Edited by: Kate Fleet, Gudrun Kr√§mer, Denis Matringe, John Nawas, Everett Rowson. Consulted online on 14 April 2018 According to Encyclop√¶dia Iranica, \\"Boraq\\" is the Arabized form of \\"Middle Persian *barƒÅg or *bƒÅrag, 'a riding beast, mount' (New Pers. bƒÅra)\\".  Description  Although the Hadith do not explicitly refer to the Buraq as having a human face, Near East and Persian art almost always portrays it so - a portrayal that found its way into Indian and Persian Islamic art. This may have originated from an interpretation of the creature being described with a \\"beautiful face\\" as the face being human instead of bestial. An excerpt from a translation of Sahih al-Bukhari describes Buraq: Another excerpt describes the Buraq in greater detail: In the earlier descriptions there is no agreement as to the sex of the Buraq. It is typically male, yet Ibn Sa'd has Gabriel address the creature as a female, and it was often rendered by painters with a woman's head. The idea that \\"al- Buraq\\" is simply a divine mare is also noted in the book The Dome of the Rock, in the chapter \\"The Open Court\\", and in the title-page vignette of Georg Ebers's Palestine in Picture and Word.  Journey to the Seventh Heaven  According to Islamic tradition, the Night Journey took place ten years after Muhammad became a prophet, during the 7th century. Muhammad had been in Mecca, at his cousin's home (the house of Fakhitah bint Abi Talib), when he went to al-Masjid al-Haram (Al-Haram Mosque). While he was resting at the Kaaba, Gabriel appeared to him bringing the Buraq, which carried Muhammad in the archangel's company, to al-Masjid al-Aqsa º, traditionally held to be the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. At this location, he alighted from the Buraq, prayed on the site of the Holy Temple (Bayt Al-Maqdis), and then mounted it again as the creature ascended to the seven heavens where he met Adam, Jesus and his cousin John the Baptist, Joseph, Enoch, Aaron, Moses and Abraham one by one until he reached the throne of God. God communicated with him giving him words and instructions, most importantly the commandment to Muslims to offer prayers, initially fifty times a day. At the urging of Moses, Muhammad returned to God several times before eventually reducing the number to five. Abraham According to Ibn Ishaq, the Buraq transported Abraham when he visited Hagar and Ishmael. Tradition states that Abraham lived with Sarah in Palestine but the Buraq would transport him in the morning to Mecca to see his family there and take him back in the evening. Western Wall A unique Buraq sculpture of Mindanaon Muslims in the Philippines. The sculpture is accompanied with indigenous okir motif. Various scholars and writers, such as ibn al-Faqih, ibn Abd Rabbih, and Abd al-Ghani al-Nabulsi, have suggested places where Buraq was supposedly tethered in stories, mostly locations near the southwest corner of the Haram. However, for several centuries the preferred location has been the al-Buraq Mosque, just inside the wall at the south end of the Western Wall Plaza. The mosque sits above an ancient passageway that once came out through the long-sealed Barclay's Gate whose huge lintel remains visible below the Maghrebi gate. Because of the proximity to the Western Wall, the area next to the wall has been associated with Buraq at least since the 19th century. When a British Jew asked the Egyptian authorities in 1840 for permission to re-pave the ground in front of the Western Wall, the governor of Syria wrote: Carl Sandreczki, charged with compiling a list of place names for Charles William Wilson's Ordnance Survey of Jerusalem in 1865, reported that the street leading to the Western Wall, including the part alongside the wall, belonged to the Hosh (court/enclosure) of al Bur√¢k, \\"not Obr√¢k, nor Obrat\\". reproduced in In 1866, the Prussian Consul and Orientalist Georg Rosen wrote: \\"The Arabs call Obr√¢k the entire length of the wall at the wailing place of the Jews, southwards down to the house of Abu Su'ud and northwards up to the substructure of the Mechkemeh [Shariah court]. Obr√¢k is not, as was formerly claimed, a corruption of the word Ibri (Hebrews), but simply the neo-Arabic pronunciation of B≈çr√¢k, ... which, whilst (Muhammad) was at prayer at the holy rock, is said to have been tethered by him inside the wall location mentioned above.\\" The name Hosh al Buraq appeared on the maps of Wilson's 1865 survey, its revised editions in 1876 and 1900, and other maps in the early 20th century. Wilson 1876 ; Wilson 1900 ; August K√ºmmel 1904 ; Karl Baedeker 1912; George Adam Smith 1915. In 1922, the official Pro-Jerusalem Council specified it as a street name. The Buraq Wall (circled in orange) facing the Al-Buraq Mosque The association of the Western Wall area with Buraq has played an important role in disputes over the holy places since the British mandate. For Muslims, the Wailing Wall (or Western Wall) is known as \\"al-·∏§ƒÅ‚Äôi·π≠u ‚Äôl-BurƒÅq\\" (Arabic: ÿßŸÑŸíÿ≠Ÿéÿßÿ¶Ÿêÿ∑Ÿè Ÿ±ŸÑŸíÿ®Ÿèÿ±ŸéÿßŸÇ) - \\"the Buraq Wall\\", for on the other side (the Muslim side of the Wailing Wall on the Temple Mount) is where Muhammad tied the Buraq, the riding animal upon which he rode during the Night of Ascension (Arabic: Mi‚ÄòrƒÅj - ŸÖŸêÿπŸíÿ±Ÿéÿßÿ¨). The wall links to the structure of the Al-Buraq Mosque.

Race classification certificate issued in terms of the Population Registration Act Explanation of South African identity numbers in an identity document during apartheid in terms of official White, Coloured and Indian population subgroups Social rights, political rights, educational opportunities, and economic status were largely determined by the group to which an individual belonged. There were three basic racial classifications under the law: Black, White and Coloured (mixed). Indians (that is, South Asians from the former British India, and their descendants) were later added as a separate classification as they were seen as having \\"no historical right to the country\\". An Office for Race Classification was set up to overview the classification process. Classification into groups was carried out using criteria such as outer appearance, general acceptance and social standing. For example, it defined a \\"white person\\" as one who \\"in appearance is obviously a white person who is generally not accepted as a coloured person; or is generally accepted as a white person and is not in appearance obviously a white person.\\" Because some aspects of the profile were of a social nature, reclassification was not uncommon, and a board was established to conduct that process. For example, the following criteria were used for separating the coloured people from the white people: * Characteristics of the person's head hair * Characteristics of the person's other hair * Skin colour * Facial features * Home language and especially the knowledge of Afrikaans * Area where the person lives, the person's friends and acquaintances * Employment * Socioeconomic status * Eating and drinking habits This law worked in tandem with other laws passed as part of the apartheid system. Under the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act of 1949, it was illegal for a white person to marry a person of another race. With the enactment of the Immorality Amendment Act of 1950, it also became a crime for a white person and a person of another race to have sexual intercourse. Under the act, as amended, Coloureds and Indians were formally classified into various subgroups, including Cape Coloured, Malay, Griqua, Chinese, Indian, Other Asian and Other Coloured. The South African Parliament repealed the act on 17 June 1991. However, the racial categories defined in the act remain ingrained in South African culture and they still form the basis of some official policies and statistics aimed at redressing past economic imbalances (Black Economic Empowerment and Employment Equity).

The VGC was established by the special (constitutional) law of 12 January 1989. The VGC has competencies for cultural, educational, well-being and health for Flemings in Brussels. It reaches an estimated 200,000 inhabitants of Brussels with its services, mostly Dutch-speakers, and a significant number of migrants. However, several of these competencies are rather limited in practice, e.g. it has not the slightest authority for hospitals. Strictly legally speaking, the VGC is only competent for institutions depending from the Flemish government, and not for individual persons. This was a consequence of the fact that no formal Flemish citizenship was established. The VGC is the successor from the Nederlandse Commissie voor de Cultuur van de Brusselse agglomeratie (NCC) (in Dutch), established in 1971. The VGC also assumed all Flemish community-specific responsibilities in Brussels from the former province Brabant when it was split up.

Penck is noted for criticizing key elements of the Davisian cycle of erosion, concluding that the process of uplift and denudation occur simultaneously, at gradual and continuous rates.Huggett 2003, p. 5 Penck's idea of parallel slope retreat led to revisions of Davis's cycle of erosion. Biography Mountains of the Black Forest where Walther Penck studied the effects of doming on geomorphology. Walther Penck was born in Vienna as the son of German geographer Albrecht Penck.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 2014 He obtained a Ph.D. by studying petrology at the Heidelberg University. Between 1912 and 1915 he worked in Direcci√≥n General de Minas in Buenos Aires before moving to the University of Constantinople where he was named professor of mineralogy and geology. He finally settled as professor in the University of Leipzig in 1918. The areas he studied in detail and based his theories on include the Black Forest in Germany, Puna de Atacama in Argentina and Anatolia in modern Turkey. During the 1920s Penck, with Siegfried Passarge, Alfred Hettner and his father, was the foremost figure in a broad German opposition to the \\"geographical cycle\\" theory of William Morris Davis.Chorley et al. 2005, p. 572 It was characteristic of Davis to react violently and disdainfully to criticism, particularly to this German criticism; it was also his characterictic to choose to attack the most vulnerable points of that criticism.Chorley et al. 2005, p. 519 Regarding Walther Penck's objections to the Davisian geographic cycle Davis commented to Albrecht Penck in 1921:Chorley et al. 2005, p. 594 > It is pleasant news that your son, Walther, is established as professor in > Leipzig where his father long ago studied. As he may have told you, I have > enjoyed reading parts of his Argentine monograph, an able piece of work, and > I have written asking him to specify the difficulties he finds in accepting > the cycle theory. I am inclined to believe that he really does not know what > that theory is... Walther Penck died of oral cancer in September 1923. His book, Morphological Analysis of Landforms, was published posthumously in 1924 by his father as was also his paper Die Piedmontfl√§chen des s√ºdlichen Schwarzwald (The piedmont- flats of the southern Black Forest).Simons 1962 Geomorphological theory =Concepts= In his analysis Penck utilized the following concepts: #Endrumpf: A low-angle landscape with concave slopes. It is the final stage of erosion that follows after inselbergs and pediments are eroded.Allaby 2008 #Grossfalt: A series of folds and synclines analogous to orogenic folding. It is usual type of folds created by lateral compression in the crust. As the grossfalt develops it narrows at the same time they become higher.Beckinsale & Chorley 2003, p. 340 Can be translated as \\"great fold\\" in English. Davis translated it into \\"broad fold\\". Penck himself was unhappy with the term grossfalt. #Piedmontfl√§che: Can be translated into English as \\"piedmont flat\\", \\"piedmont bench\\" or \\"piedmont step\\".Sube 2001, p. 1019 #Piedmonttreppen: descending erosional benches on an uplifted area. Their shape is more or less concentric. Penck interpreted the Piedmonttreppen as the result of doming. Benches he thought originated as Piedmontflache in the periphery of the dome before they were uplifted. It can be translated into English as \\"piedmont benchland\\", \\"piedmont stairway\\" or \\"piedmont treppe\\". #Prim√§rrumpf: A more or less plain and subtly convex slope. The form is given by the very slow waxing of erosion. Erosion cycles should begin from a prim√§rrumpf. Can be formed at the base of a dome. #Rumpfl√§che =Landform and landscape evolution according to uplift rate= Walther Penck thought landform development depended on uplift rate. He saw three main types of landform and landscape development all of which begun with rumpfl√§ches or prim√§rrumpfs and ended with endrumpfs. The differences between them depended on their rate of uplift: peneplains developed in places with a low rate of uplift, intermediate forms developed in places of moderate uplift, and Alpine forms developed on places of rapid uplift.Chorley et al. 2005, p. 619 In Penck's valley development model the steepness of valley slopes depended on the rate of uplift; this view contrasts with the Davis's erosion cycle, in which valley slope steepness depends on its relative age or stage of development.Chorley et al. 2005, p. 629 =Landform associations= Sierra de Famatina in Argentina interpreted as part of a \\"grossfalt\\" by Penck. Penck thought earths surface could be divided into three types of regions each with an own landform association. First there were regions of grossfalt and general doming, then there were regions of pure doming, and at last there were regions of stability. Criticism and legacy William Morris Davis, a friend of Penck's father,Chorley et al. 2005, p. 571 criticized the theories Walther Penck outlined in Die Piedmontflichen des s√ºdlichen Schwarzwald. Geographer Martin Simons claimed in 1962 that Davis misunderstood and mis-translated parts of the paper leaving a distorted view of Penck's ideas among later workers. Simons therefore does not consider Davis an adequate critic of Penck's work. Other factors detrimental to an understanding of Penck's ideas include his early death and his confusing writing style. Douglas Wilson Johnson, a coastal geomorphologist and staunch supporter of Davis, criticized Penck's theory harshly as: :‚ÄúPenck‚Äôs conception that slope profiles are convex, plane, or concave according to the circumstances of the uplifting action, [as] one of the most fantastic errors ever introduced into geomorphology‚Äù Julius B√ºdel, a German geomorphologist working in the same areas as Penck in Southern Germany, provided alternative explanations in 1935 for some of the landforms Penck had dealt with.Mensching 1984 Geographer Allaoua Saadi remarks by 2013 that Penck's and Davis' ideas have become more compatible and even complementary since the advent of modern tectonic theory. This author claims that Davis' ideas are more applicable near active margins where tectonics are \\"cataclysmic\\" and Penck's ideas fit better in passive margins and continental platforms.Saadi 2013 Walther Penck has a volcano named after him in northwestern Argentina.

He belonged to a family of rank, and his parents entrusted his education to Pere de la Rue, a Jesuit, who made earnest efforts to induce him to join the order. But he had no religious vocation and proceeded to study law. He practised at the bar for some time, but his marriage to the daughter of the comedian Francois Lenoir de la Thorilliere led him to become an actor, and in 1685, in spite of the strong opposition of his family, he appeared at the Theatre Francais. His gifts as a comedian gave him immediate and marked success, both with the public and with his fellow actors. He was the spokesman of his company on occasions of state, and in this capacity he frequently appeared before Louis XIV., who treated him with great favour. One of his most famous impersonations was Alceste in Moli√®re's The Misanthrope. His first play, Le Notaire obligeant, produced in 1685, was well received. La D√©solation des joueuses (1687) was still more successful. Le Chevalier √† la mode (1687) is generally regarded as his best work, though his claim to original authorship in this and some other cases has been disputed. In Le Chevalier √† la mode appears the bourgeoise infatuated with the desire to be an aristocrat. The type is developed in Les Bourgeoises de la mode (1692) and Les Bourgeoises de qualit√© (1700). Dancourt was a prolific author, and produced some sixty plays in all, including Le Diable boiteux (1707, an adaptation of the eponymous novel from Lesage). Some years before his death he terminated his career both as an actor and as an author by retiring to his chateau at Courcelles le Roi, in Berry, where he employed himself in making a poetical translation of the Psalms and in writing a sacred tragedy. The plays of Dancourt are faithful descriptions of the manners of the time, and as such have real historical value. The characters are drawn with a realistic touch that led to his being styled by Charles Palissot the Teniers of comedy. He is very successful in his delineation of low life, and especially of the peasantry. The dialogue is sparkling, witty and natural. Many of the incidents of his plots were derived from actual occurrences in the fast and scandalous life of the period, and several of his characters were drawn from well-known personages of the day. Most of the plays incline to the type of farce rather than of pure comedy. Voltaire defined his talent in the words: \\"What Regnard was in respect to Moliere in the high comedy, Dancourt was in the farce.\\" () His two daughters, Manon and Marie-Anne (Mimi), both obtained success on the stage of the Th√©√¢tre Francais.

In addition to their lyrics, which often focus on historical incidents and/or folklore, the Decemberists are also well known for their eclectic live shows. Audience participation is a part of each performance, typically during encores. The band stages whimsical reenactments of sea battles and other centuries-old events, typically of regional interest, or acts out songs with members of the crowd. In 2011, the track \\"Down by the Water\\" from the album The King Is Dead was nominated for Best Rock Song at the 54th Grammy Awards.

The band's first drummer, Ezra Holbrook, was replaced by Rachel Blumberg after Castaways and Cutouts, who in turn was replaced by John Moen after Picaresque. The band's name refers to the Decembrist revolt, an 1825 insurrection in Imperial Russia. Meloy has stated that the name is also meant to invoke the \\"drama and melancholy\\" of the month of December. 5 Songs, the band's debut extended play, was self-released in 2001. The members at that time played for several hours in a McMenamins hotel the night before to raise the money needed to record in the studio the next day. This originally served as a demo tape and the five songs on it (minus \\"Apology Song\\") were recorded in under two hours. =2003‚Äì2005: Kill Rock Stars= After releasing its first full record, Castaways and Cutouts, on Hush Records, the group moved onto the Kill Rock Stars recording label. After the re-release of Castaways, Her Majesty the Decemberists was released in 2003. In 2004, the band released \\"The Tain,\\" an eighteen-and-a-half minute single track based on the Irish mythological epic T√°in B√≥ C√∫ailnge. The band's final album with Kill Rock Stars was Picaresque, which was recorded in a former church. In March 2005, the band distributed a music video via BitTorrent, the self-produced \\"16 Military Wives\\" (from Picaresque). In the same month, the band's equipment trailer was stolen; fans contributed to a replacement fund, and another fundraiser was organized via an eBay auction, with buyers bidding for copies of Colin Meloy Sings Morrissey and original artwork by Carson Ellis. The band also received help from Lee Kruger, the Shins, The Dandy Warhols, and other musicians. C.F. Martin & Company offered 6- and 12-string guitars on permanent loan. In early April, police discovered the trailer and a portion of the band's merchandise in Clackamas, Oregon, but the instruments and equipment were not recovered.Hunt, Pete.

The supporting tour (called \\"The Rout of the Patagons Tour\\") began on October 17, 2006, at Portland, Oregon's Crystal Ballroom. The opening act was Lavender Diamond. Later in the tour, Alasdair Roberts opened for the band. In 2006, The Crane Wife was voted NPR listeners' favorite album of the year, as announced on the December 5 episode of All Songs Considered, and it remains one of the Decemberists' most critically acclaimed records. In November 2006, the band encouraged fans to create a music video for the single \\"O Valencia!\\" using footage of the band in front of a green screen. On his Comedy Central program, Stephen Colbert started a mock feud with the band, claiming his \\"green screen challenge\\" came first; the band countered that its 2005 on-stage lightsaber fight in San Francisco preceded Colbert's idea. The feud culminated in a December 20 guitar solo competition on Colbert's show, with lead guitarist Funk representing the band. After Colbert feigned a hand injury, Peter Frampton took over for Colbert and won an audience vote. Show guests got involved, with New York Governor-elect Eliot Spitzer and Dr. Henry Kissinger declaring, \\"Tonight, I think the American people won.\\" The prize for winning the challenge was revealed to be a copy of The Crane Wife. According to Meloy, the Colbert challenge was not scripted, though the band was told that Frampton would step in for Colbert. =2007: \\"A Bit of Grass-Stain Does Not a Ruined Pair of Jeans Make\\" tour= In July 2007, the band embarked on a five-date tour with a full orchestral accompaniment.

The track \\"The Rake's Song\\" was put up for download on The Decemberists website in advance of the album's release. During Meloy's 2008 U.S. tour, he played several new songs that were included on the album. The album was produced by Tucker Martine. In a post on Rolling Stone's \\"Rock 'n' Roll Daily\\" blog, the band revealed more details about the album. The original plan was for The Hazards of Love to be a staged musical. However, it seems that the story was \\"unstageable\\" in such a format. Instead the band played the entire album start to finish at each concert on the spring tour. A press release read: \\"The album began when Meloy ‚Äì long fascinated by the British folk revival of the 1960s ‚Äì found a copy of revered vocalist Anne Briggs's 1966 EP, titled The Hazards of Love. Since there was no actual song with the album‚Äôs title, he set out to write one, but was soon immersed in something much larger. The Hazards of Love tells the tale of a woman named Margaret; her shape-shifting lover, William; his fey forest queen mother; and a cold-blooded, lascivious rake, who recounts with spine-chilling ease how he came \\"to be living so easy and free\\" in \\"The Rake's Song\\".

The newsletter included a complete list of dates for the first leg of the tour ending on June 14 at the Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival in Manchester, Tennessee. On Monday April 27, the band performed a shortened version of \\"The Wanting Comes in Waves/Repaid\\" on The Colbert Report. On August 14, 2009, the Decemberists played in Pittsburgh, PA at the Benedum Center. During the show, the band members performed a skit where they ran up and down the aisles participating in a fictitious battle at Fort Pitt. On September 19, 2009, The Decemberists played a \\"lottery show\\", originally billed as a \\"by request\\" show, at Terminal 5 in New York City. The setlist was composed of songs drawn from a large bingo turner kept on stage. The master of ceremonies for the evening was singer/songwriter John Wesley Harding and the opening act was Laura Veirs and the Hall of Flames. The randomized setlist included \\"July, July!\\", \\"Yankee Bayonet (I Will Be Home Then)\\", \\"The Tain I-V\\", \\"Annan Water\\", \\"The Crane Wife 3\\" and \\"The Island/Come and See/The Landlord's Daughter/You'll Not Feel the Drowning\\", and an original song, as a bingo ball suggested, called \\"Miracle on the Hudson\\". In 2009, The Decemberists also contributed the song \\"Sleepless\\" to the AIDS benefit album Dark Was the Night, which was produced by the Red Hot Organization. During their European tour in the winter of 2010, the band performed \\"The Mariner's Revenge Song\\" at the conclusion of each date.

The King Is Dead was released on January 14, 2011, with Peter Buck of R.E.M. contributing instrumentation to three of its songs. Colin Meloy later affirmed that R.E.M. had been an inspiration during the writing and recording of some of the album's material. \\"Down by the Water,\\" a track from the new album, was released via the band's official site on November 2, and was immediately available on iTunes as a free download. The song would later be nominated for Best Rock Song at the 54th Grammy Awards. The King Is Dead debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in the United States upon its release, the first time a Decemberists album would achieve this. As compared to the band's previous work, which was influenced by the music of the British folk revival, The King Is Dead was more influenced by traditionally American genres including country, blues, and Americana.Meatto, Keith The Decemberists in January ‚Äì A Review of The King is Dead.

During the tour, on May 3, it was announced on The Decemberists' official site that Jenny Conlee had been diagnosed with breast cancer and would miss most of the band's remaining tour dates while receiving treatment and recovering. In support of their bandmate, the band designed a 'Team Jenny' charity t-shirt for the Yellow Bird Project to raise money for Planned Parenthood. Conlee would later make a full recovery after her cancer went into remission. Meanwhile, on April 7, 2011, the band released a music video for their song \\"This Is Why We Fight\\".

Jos√© de Mora was born in Baza. He was the oldest son of the sculptor Bernardo de Mora and pupil of Alonso Cano in Granada and of Sebasti√°n de Herrera in Madrid. In 1669, two years after the death of Cano, he moved to Madrid and worked with Sebasti√°n de Herrera Barnuevo who also had been pupil of Cano. In 1672, he became a sculptor for the king Charles II and later left Madrid in 1680 and returned to Granada. He died in Granada in 1724 and was buried in the Convent of St. Anthony of the Discalced Franciscan Friars. His work can be usefully studied in the eight statues in the Chapel of Cardinal Salazar in the Mosque-Cathedral in C√≥rdoba, and in the statues of Saint Bruno and Saint Joseph in the Charterhouse near Granada. However, his main masterpiece was the sculpture of the Christ of Salvation (currently, Christ of Mercy), made for a funerary chapel in the Church of St. Gregory Baeticus in Granada. The origins of this great sculpture were unknown until the year 2018, when Dr. Jos√© Antonio D√≠az (Art historian from the University of Granada), discovered and published the documents which reveal all the information about this relevant sculpture of the Spanish Baroque.

He was the fifth of six children born to Arthur Nixon and Phylis Thompson. Robert's mother Phylis worked as a housewife while his father worked locally as a steelworker. As a child, Robert spent much of his time drawing and sketching, and his artistic skills were recognised when he was seven years old by teachers at Cromwell Road School which he attended in South Bank. During his early years as an artist, and supported by teachers at the Central Secondary Modern School (Victoria Street, Southbank), Robert won several art competitions and a scholarship to Middlesbrough art college in 1955 when he was sixteen. Although his time at art college was cut short by the death of his father, Bob gained employment locally as a lithographic artist and left in 1965 to pursue his career as a full-time cartoonist, initially for DC Thomson's of Dundee. During this transition Robert met and married Rita Kelly and after living in Middlesbrough for several years they moved to Guisborough in Cleveland where they raised their four children - Paul, Tony, Wendy and Catherine. Biography In The Beano, he started out drawing Little Plum in the early 1960s after Leo Baxendale left DC Thomson. He later took over Roger the Dodger from Ken Reid and Lord Snooty from Dudley D. Watkins, and revived Grandpa, another Ken Reid creation, in the early 1970s in the same comic, as well as Captain Cutler and His Butler and Esky Mo in Sparky. He left DC Thomson shortly afterwards, and started to work at IPC Magazines (Fleetway), drawing such characters as Kid Kong, Frankie Stein and Gums. Nixon drew The 12¬Ωp Buytonic Boy for Krazy, although Brian Walker frequently deputised when Nixon was on leave. The strip first appeared in issue 1, dated 16 October 1976. Nixon returned to DC Thomson in 1984 after being asked to by new Beano editor Euan Kerr, and began drawing Roger the Dodger again, as well as creating Ivy the Terrible in 1985. Later his friend Trevor Metcalfe drew this strip. Nixon's strips are still being reprinted in The Beano, appearing regularly as recently as 2011. He would go on to draw Beryl the Peril in The Topper and Korky the Cat in The Dandy later on in the decade, and continue drawing them throughout the 1990s.

Metabolically, the insulin receptor plays a key role in the regulation of glucose homeostasis, a functional process that under degenerate conditions may result in a range of clinical manifestations including diabetes and cancer. Insulin signalling controls access to blood glucose in body cells. When insulin falls, especially in those with high insulin sensitivity, body cells begin only to have access to lipids that do not require transport across the membrane. So, in this way, insulin is the key regulator of fat metabolism as well. Biochemically, the insulin receptor is encoded by a single gene , from which alternate splicing during transcription results in either IR-A or IR-B isoforms. Downstream post-translational events of either isoform result in the formation of a proteolytically cleaved Œ± and Œ≤ subunit, which upon combination are ultimately capable of homo or hetero-dimerisation to produce the ‚âà320 kDa disulfide-linked transmembrane insulin receptor.  Structure  Initially, transcription of alternative splice variants derived from the INSR gene are translated to form one of two monomeric isomers; IR-A in which exon 11 is excluded, and IR-B in which exon 11 is included. Inclusion of exon 11 results in the addition of 12 amino acids upstream of the intrinsic furin proteolytic cleavage site. Colour-coded schematic of the insulin receptor Upon receptor dimerisation, after proteolytic cleavage into the Œ±- and Œ≤-chains, the additional 12 amino acids remain present at the C-terminus of the Œ±-chain (designated Œ±CT) where they are predicted to influence receptor‚Äìligand interaction. Each isometric monomer is structurally organized into 8 distinct domains consists of; a leucine-rich repeat domain (L1, residues 1-157), a cysteine-rich region (CR, residues 158-310), an additional leucine rich repeat domain (L2, residues 311-470), three fibronectin type III domains; FnIII-1 (residues 471-595), FnIII-2 (residues 596-808) and FnIII-3 (residues 809-906). Additionally, an insert domain (ID, residues 638-756) resides within FnIII-2, containing the Œ±/Œ≤ furin cleavage site, from which proteolysis results in both IDŒ± and IDŒ≤ domains. Within the Œ≤-chain, downstream of the FnIII-3 domain lies a transmembrane helix (TH) and intracellular juxtamembrane (JM) region, just upstream of the intracellular tyrosine kinase (TK) catalytic domain, responsible for subsequent intracellular signaling pathways. Upon cleavage of the monomer to its respective Œ±- and Œ≤-chains, receptor hetero or homo- dimerisation is maintained covalently between chains by a single disulphide link and between monomers in the dimer by two disulphide links extending from each Œ±-chain. The overall 3D ectodomain structure, possessing four ligand binding sites, resembles an inverted 'V', with the each monomer rotated approximately 2-fold about an axis running parallel to the inverted 'V' and L2 and FnIII-1 domains from each monomer forming the inverted 'V's apex.  Ligand binding  Ligand-induced conformation changes in the full-length human insulin receptor reconstituted in nanodiscs. Left - unactivated receptor conformation; right - insulin-activated receptor conformation. The changes are visualized with the electron microscopy of an individual molecule (upper panel) and schematically depicted as a cartoon (lower panel). Left - cryo-EM structure of the ligand-saturated IR ectodomain; right - 4 binding sites and IR structure upon binding schematically depicted as a cartoon. The insulin receptor's endogenous ligands include insulin, IGF-I and IGF-II. Using a cryo- EM, structural insight into conformational changes upon insulin binding was provided. Binding of ligand to the Œ±-chains of the IR dimeric ectodomain shifts it from an inverted U-shape to a T-shaped conformation, and this change is propagated structurally to the transmembrane domains, which get closer, eventually leading to autophosphorylation of various tyrosine residues within the intracellular TK domain of the Œ≤-chain. These changes facilitate the recruitment of specific adapter proteins such as the insulin receptor substrate proteins (IRS) in addition to SH2-B (Src Homology 2 - B ), APS and protein phosphatases, such as PTP1B, eventually promoting downstream processes involving blood glucose homeostasis. Strictly speaking the relationship between IR and ligand shows complex allosteric properties. This was indicated with the use of a Scatchard plots which identified that the measurement of the ratio of IR bound ligand to unbound ligand does not follow a linear relationship with respect to changes in the concentration of IR bound ligand, suggesting that the IR and its respective ligand share a relationship of cooperative binding. Furthermore, the observation that the rate of IR-ligand dissociation is accelerated upon addition of unbound ligand implies that the nature of this cooperation is negative; said differently, that the initial binding of ligand to the IR inhibits further binding to its second active site - exhibition of allosteric inhibition. These models state that each IR monomer possesses 2 insulin binding sites; site 1, which binds to the 'classical' binding surface of insulin: consisting of L1 plus Œ±CT domains and site 2, consisting of loops at the junction of FnIII-1 and FnIII-2 predicted to bind to the 'novel' hexamer face binding site of insulin. As each monomer contributing to the IR ectodomain exhibits 3D 'mirrored' complementarity, N-terminal site 1 of one monomer ultimately faces C-terminal site 2 of the second monomer, where this is also true for each monomers mirrored complement (the opposite side of the ectodomain structure). Current literature distinguishes the complement binding sites by designating the second monomer's site 1 and site 2 nomenclature as either site 3 and site 4 or as site 1' and site 2' respectively. As such, these models state that each IR may bind to an insulin molecule (which has two binding surfaces) via 4 locations, being site 1, 2, (3/1') or (4/2'). As each site 1 proximally faces site 2, upon insulin binding to a specific site, 'crosslinking' via ligand between monomers is predicted to occur (i.e. as [monomer 1 Site 1 - Insulin - monomer 2 Site (4/2')] or as [monomer 1 Site 2 - Insulin - monomer 2 site (3/1')]). In accordance with current mathematical modelling of IR-insulin kinetics, there are two important consequences to the events of insulin crosslinking; 1. that by the aforementioned observation of negative cooperation between IR and its ligand that subsequent binding of ligand to the IR is reduced and 2. that the physical action of crosslinking brings the ectodomain into such a conformation that is required for intracellular tyrosine phosphorylation events to ensue (i.e. these events serve as the requirements for receptor activation and eventual maintenance of blood glucose homeostasis). Applying cryo-EM and molecular dynamics simulations of receptor reconstituted in nanodiscs, the structure of the entire dimeric insulin receptor ectodomain with four insulin molecules bound was visualized, therefore confirming and directly showing biochemically predicted 4 binding locations. =Agonists= * 4548-G05 * Insulin * Insulin-like growth factor 1 * Mecasermin  Signal transduction pathway  The Insulin Receptor is a type of tyrosine kinase receptor, in which the binding of an agonistic ligand triggers autophosphorylation of the tyrosine residues, with each subunit phosphorylating its partner. The addition of the phosphate groups generates a binding site for the insulin receptor substrate (IRS-1), which is subsequently activated via phosphorylation. The activated IRS-1 initiates the signal transduction pathway and binds to phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), in turn causing its activation. This then catalyses the conversion of Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 acts as a secondary messenger and induces the activation of phosphatidylinositol dependent protein kinase, which then activates several other kinases ‚Äì most notably protein kinase B, (PKB, also known as Akt). PKB triggers the translocation of glucose transporter (GLUT4) containing vesicles to the cell membrane, via the activation of SNARE proteins, to facilitate the diffusion of glucose into the cell. PKB also phosphorylates and inhibits glycogen synthase kinase, which is an enzyme that inhibits glycogen synthase. Therefore, PKB acts to start the process of glycogenesis, which ultimately reduces blood-glucose concentration.  Function  = Regulation of gene expression = The activated IRS-1 acts as a secondary messenger within the cell to stimulate the transcription of insulin-regulated genes. First, the protein Grb2 binds the P-Tyr residue of IRS-1 in its SH2 domain. Grb2 is then able to bind SOS, which in turn catalyzes the replacement of bound GDP with GTP on Ras, a G protein. This protein then begins a phosphorylation cascade, culminating in the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which enters the nucleus and phosphorylates various nuclear transcription factors (such as Elk1). = Stimulation of glycogen synthesis = Glycogen synthesis is also stimulated by the insulin receptor via IRS-1. In this case, it is the SH2 domain of PI-3 kinase (PI-3K) that binds the P-Tyr of IRS-1. Now activated, PI-3K can convert the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3). This indirectly activates a protein kinase, PKB (Akt), via phosphorylation. PKB then phosphorylates several target proteins, including glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3). GSK-3 is responsible for phosphorylating (and thus deactivating) glycogen synthase. When GSK-3 is phosphorylated, it is deactivated, and prevented from deactivating glycogen synthase. In this roundabout manner, insulin increases glycogen synthesis. = Degradation of insulin = Once an insulin molecule has docked onto the receptor and effected its action, it may be released back into the extracellular environment or it may be degraded by the cell. Degradation normally involves endocytosis of the insulin-receptor complex followed by the action of insulin degrading enzyme. Most insulin molecules are degraded by liver cells. It has been estimated that a typical insulin molecule is finally degraded about 71 minutes after its initial release into circulation. = Immune system = Besides the metabolic function, insulin receptors are also expressed on immune cells, such as macrophages, B cells, and T cells. On T cells, the expression of insulin receptors is undetectable during the resting state but up-regulated upon T-cell receptor (TCR) activation. Indeed, insulin has been shown when supplied exogenously to promote in vitro T cell proliferation in animal models. Insulin receptor signalling is important for maximizing the potential effect of T cells during acute infection and inflammation.  Pathology  The main activity of activation of the insulin receptor is inducing glucose uptake. For this reason \\"insulin insensitivity\\", or a decrease in insulin receptor signaling, leads to diabetes mellitus type 2 ‚Äì the cells are unable to take up glucose, and the result is hyperglycemia (an increase in circulating glucose), and all the sequelae that result from diabetes. Patients with insulin resistance may display acanthosis nigricans. A few patients with homozygous mutations in the INSR gene have been described, which causes Donohue syndrome or Leprechaunism. This autosomal recessive disorder results in a totally non-functional insulin receptor. These patients have low-set, often protuberant, ears, flared nostrils, thickened lips, and severe growth retardation. In most cases, the outlook for these patients is extremely poor, with death occurring within the first year of life. Other mutations of the same gene cause the less severe Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome, in which patients have characteristically abnormal teeth, hypertrophic gingiva (gums), and enlargement of the pineal gland. Both diseases present with fluctuations of the glucose level: After a meal the glucose is initially very high, and then falls rapidly to abnormally low levels.

External  The Octave of a feast refers to an eight-day festal period commencing with that feast. Since the 1969 revision of the General Roman Calendar, Easter is one of two solemnities that carries an octave, the second being Christmas Day. In earlier forms of the General Roman Calendar, many feasts, even of lower rank, carry octaves. The name Quasimodo came from the Latin text of the traditional Introit for this day, which begins \\"Quasi modo geniti infantes...\\" from 1 Peter ,The full line is Quasi modo geniti infantes, rationabile, sine dolo lac concupiscite, from Catholic Encyclopedia listing for Low Sunday.

On the Octave Day of Easter, called Saint Thomas Sunday in the East, the Gospel reading is always , relating the appearance of Christ to his disciples, with Thomas the Apostle present, on the Sunday following his resurrection. A traditional name in English is Low Sunday, perhaps given this name because of the contrast with the high festival of Easter on the preceding Sunday,The Chambers Dictionary (Allied Publishers 1998 ), p. 954 or the word \\"Low\\" may be a corruption of Latin Laudes, the first word of a sequence in use in the Sarum Rite.C.

The Saturday before Divine Mercy Sunday is the culmination of the novena to the Divine Mercy of Jesus, a devotion given to St. Faustina (Maria Faustina Kowalska), and is based upon an entry in her diary stating that anyone who participates in the Mass and receives the sacraments of Confession and the Eucharist on this day is assured by Jesus of full remission of their sins and punishments.

Retrieved 2 August 2011. Thomas Sunday and Renewal Sunday are other names by which this Sunday is known. The former name refers to the event commemorated that day, described in the Gospel passage read that day at the Divine Liturgy, (), which recounts the story of Christ appearing to the Apostle Thomas in order to dispel the latter's doubt about the Resurrection. Among Eastern Christians Thomas is not so much remembered as \\"doubting Thomas,\\" but is rather remembered for his confession of faith: \\"My Lord and my God,\\" thus being the first to publicly proclaim the two natures of Christ: human and divine. The latter name reflects that on that day the celebration of the Resurrection is repeated and renewed. The entire week from Pascha to Thomas Sunday, known as Bright Week, is considered to be one continuous day. Literary note *Quasimodo, protagonist of the 1831 French novel Notre Dame de Paris (most often called in English The Hunchback of Notre Dame) by Victor Hugo, was found abandoned on the doorsteps of Notre Dame Cathedral on the Sunday after Easter, AD 1467.

It first appeared in the August 1953 issue of Science Fiction Quarterly and has been reprinted several times: in the 1959 short-story collection Galactic Cluster; in The Testament of Andros (1965); in The Penguin Science Fiction Omnibus (1973); and in Isaac Asimov Presents the Great SF Stories.James Blish Bibliography The story is considered to be an archetype of symbolism in science fiction.  Synopsis  A man named Garrard is a test pilot for an experimental space ship bound for Alpha Centauri. Previous attempts to make the trip have failed. Garrard is put in the ship in suspended animation and wakes up after the ship has gone into \\"over-drive\\". The first thing he remembers is the injunction: \\"Don't move\\". Garrard realizes that ship time seems to be almost stopped relative to his conscious time; he is not breathing, and his muscles respond slowly to mental directions. He calculates that 6000 years of subjective time will pass before the ship reaches its goal. Suddenly, he realizes that ship time is speeding up, until it equals, then exceeds, his subjective time. As the differential time rates increase, he again loses control of his body and goes into \\"pseudo-death\\". Garrard awakes as the ship comes out of overdrive near Alpha Centauri. Around him in the space ship is a group of dreamlike beings that call themselves \\"the clinesterton beademung\\" and speak to him in dream-language, which he understands perfectly. The story's narrative also becomes dreamlike at this point, suggesting that Garrard's experiences are indescribable. As the ship's automatic mechanism is about to start the journey back to Earth, Garrard again goes into pseudo-death, and remains in that state until the ship nears Earth. He lands safely. He can no longer remember what the \\"beademung\\" was like or even if it was real, but he has a haunting sense of loss. Symbolism In In Search of Wonder, Damon Knight argues that the story is a symbolic representation of fertilization of a female ovum by a sperm, and that the protagonist Garrard is the sperm. The Earth represents the testes; Alpha Centauri is the uterus; and the beademung is the ovum. Furthermore, Knight argues, the first part of the story, which contains all the intercourse symbolism, is told backwards. Even the title, Knight argues, is an unintentiontial pun for \\"Come on time\\". Author's commentary James Blish (quoted by Damon Knight ) said about Knight's interpretation of his story: > The reference to the Alpha Centauri stars as 'the twin radioceles' obviously > comes from varicocele, a common form of hernia involving the testicles, and > I think now that the whole thing was suggested by the Earth-Moon balls on > the cover around which I wrote the story. The main Alpha Centauri star and > Proxima Centauri stand in about the same relationship as the Earth and the > Moon, and both pairs might be described as one-hung-low. Also, the story is > about love-and-death; it says it is. But I'm just now beginning to believe > it. Writing frightens me.

His most famous work is Bambi, a Life in the Woods (1923). Life and death Salten was born 6 September 1869 as Siegmund Salzmann in Pest, Austria-Hungary. He was the grandson of an Orthodox rabbi. When he was four weeks old, his family relocated to Vienna, Austria. Many Jews were immigrating into the city during the late 19th century because Vienna had granted full citizenship to Jews in 1867. When his father became bankrupt, the sixteen-year-old Salten quit school and began working for an insurance agency. He also began submitting poems and book reviews to journals. He became part of the \\"Young Vienna\\" movement (Jung Wien) and soon received work as a full-time art and theater critic for Vienna's press (Wiener Allgemeine Zeitung, Zeit). In 1900 he published his first collection of short stories. In 1901 he initiated Vienna's first, short-lived literary cabaret Jung-Wiener Theater Zum lieben Augustin. He was soon publishing, on an average, one book a year, of plays, short stories, novels, travel books, and essay collections. He also wrote for nearly all the major newspapers of Vienna. In 1906 Salten went to Ullstein as an editor in chief of the B.Z. am Mittag and the Berliner Morgenpost, but relocated to Vienna some months later. He wrote also film scripts and librettos for operettas. In 1927 he became president of the Austrian P.E.N. club as successor of Arthur Schnitzler. Author Felix Salten wearing a traditional Austrian hunting outfit with a Janker jacket, hat and Gamsbart The most famous work of Salten, who himself was an avid hunter, is Bambi (1923). It was translated into English in 1928 and became a Book-of-the-Month Club success. In 1933, he sold the film rights to the American director Sidney Franklin for only $1,000, and Franklin later transferred the rights to the Walt Disney studios, which formed the basis of the 1942 animated classic, Bambi. Life in Austria became perilous for a prominent Jew during the 1930s. In Germany, Adolf Hitler had Salten's books banned in 1936. Two years later, after Germany's annexation of Austria, Salten moved to Zurich, Switzerland, with his wife, and spent his final years there. Felix Salten died on 8 October 1945, at the age of 76. He is buried at Israelitischer Friedhof Unterer Friesenberg. Salten married actress Ottilie Metzl (1868‚Äì1942) in 1902, and had two children: Paul (1903‚Äì1937) and Anna Katharina (1904‚Äì1977). He composed another book based on the character Bambi, titled Bambi‚Äôs Children: The Story of a Forest Family (1939). His stories Perri and The Hound of Florence inspired the Disney films Perri (1957) and The Shaggy Dog (1959), respectively.

The WIP ran eleven candidates in the 1988 federal election - one candidate in British Columbia, seven in Alberta, and three in Manitoba (although one of the Manitoba candidates appears to have withdrawn before election day). All the candidates were soundly defeated with none garnering even 1% of the popular vote in any riding. The party also had provincial branches in each of the four provinces. The federal wing of the Western Independence Party fell dormant and did not run any candidates in any federal elections after 1988. The party was resurrected in April 2005 at a founding convention in Strathmore, Alberta under the new name \\"Western Canada Party\\". The WIP should not be confused with the Confederation of Regions Party, which sought greater autonomy for western Canada, but not full independence. Founding The party was founded by a group of 150 people from across the western provinces. The WIP was formed because the group had grown dissatisfied with the direction of another western separatist party, the federal Western Canada Concept (WCC), led by a lawyer Douglas Christie of Victoria, B.C. At the party's founding convention in October 1987 in Edmonton, Fred Marshall was elected interim leader. Marshall had run for the leadership of the provincial WCC in 1984, losing to future Reform Party Member of Parliament Jack Ramsay of Camrose, Alberta. Also at the founding convention, the party adopted the \\"West Canada Flag\\" which was designed by Dexter Dombro and was chosen from a field of eight other entries. WIP in Alberta / Alberta Independence Party Bob Lefurgey attempted to collect enough signatures to form official party status of the WIP as a provincially registered party in Alberta, but failed to obtain enough signatures. Lefurgey described his mission as separation. \\"It's basically to remove Alberta from confederation,\\" said Lefurgey. \\"There's been an accumulation of things over time and we're in a perfect storm for separatists right now, with all the things going on ‚Äì everything from immigration, gun control, equalization.\\" The Alberta Independence Party never achieved party status when it ran candidates in 2001 election. The AIP is experiencing a revival and strives to run candidates in the 2019 provincial election and form party status. The Separation Party of Alberta, which nominated candidates in the 2004 provincial election, promoted the cause of separation in the province but renamed itself the Alberta First Party in 2013. In July 2018, MLA Derek Fildebrandt became leader of the party, which rebranded itself as the Freedom Conservative Party of Alberta. As a result, separatism has been removed from the platform, and instead adopting Albertan autonomism as part of the party's transformation. Lefurgey remains listed as President of the party by Elections Alberta. The SPA issued a statement of support when the WIP of Saskatchewan was formed in 2003. WIP of Saskatchewan The Saskatchewan branch of the party nominated candidates in the 2003 provincial election, and the 2007 provincial election, but none were elected. It continues to be an active party under the leadership of Dana Arnason, but does not intend to nominate candidates in federal elections. Party program Party policy was adopted at the founding convention and was expanded at a policy convention in Saskatoon in April 1988. The party's basic policy statements were the following: # independence as the only way Westerners could get political and economic justice; # the constitutional right to private property; # the citizen's right to a referendum on major issues including the constitution and constitutional amendments; # English as the official language; and # an elected, equal and effective Senate. =The party's vision of an independent Western Canada= # A prosperous low tax economy. # Direct democracy. # Separation of executive powers to end Prime Ministerial dictatorship. # An elected accountable judiciary. # Equality of treatment and opportunity for all people. # An elected senate balancing popular representation with regional representation. # English as the official language. # A world-class medical system. # A justice system that stresses accountability. # No gun registry. # No Kyoto Accord. # Property rights guaranteed in the constitution.

The Act defined eight data protection principles to ensure that information was processed lawfully. It was superseded by the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA 2018) on 23 May 2018. The DPA 2018 supplements the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into effect on 25 May 2018. The GDPR regulates the collection, storage, and use of personal data significantly more strictly. Background The 1998 Act replaced the Data Protection Act 1984 and the Access to Personal Files Act 1987, and implemented the EU Data Protection Directive 1995. The Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 altered the consent requirement for most electronic marketing to \\"positive consent\\" such as an opt-in box. Exemptions remain for the marketing of \\"similar products and services\\" to existing customers and enquirers, which can still be given permission on an opt out basis. The Jersey data protection law was modelled on the United Kingdoms law.Jersey: Data Protection In Jersey And Other Offshore Jurisdictions 23 July 2008 Article by Wendy Benjamin, mondaq.com, Contents =Scope of protection= Section 1 defines \\"personal data\\" as any data that can be used to identify a living individual. Anonymised or aggregated data is less regulated by the Act, providing the anonymisation or aggregation has not been done in a reversible way. Individuals can be identified by various means including their name and address, telephone number or email address. The Act applies only to data which is held, or intended to be held, on computers ('equipment operating automatically in response to instructions given for that purpose'), or held in a 'relevant filing system'. In some cases paper records may be classified as a 'relevant filing system', such as an address book or a salesperson's diary used to support commercial activities. The Freedom of Information Act 2000 modified the act for public bodies and authorities, and the Durant case modified the interpretation of the act by providing case law and precedent.

In order for data to be classed as 'fairly processed', at least one of these six conditions must be applicable to that data (Schedule 2). # The data subject (the person whose data is stored) has consented (\\"given their permission\\") to the processing; # Processing is necessary for the performance of, or commencing, a contract; # Processing is required under a legal obligation (other than one stated in the contract); # Processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject; # Processing is necessary to carry out any public functions; # Processing is necessary in order to pursue the legitimate interests of the \\"data controller\\" or \\"third parties\\" (unless it could unjustifiably prejudice the interests of the data subject).OPSI.gov.uk Data Protection Act 1998 Schedule 2 ;Consent Except under the below mentioned exceptions, the individual needs to consent to the collection of their personal information and its use in the purpose(s) in question. The European Data Protection Directive defines consent as ‚Äú‚Ä¶any freely given specific and informed indication of his wishes by which the data subject signifies his agreement to personal data relating to him being processed\\", meaning the individual may signify agreement other than in writing. However, non-communication should not be interpreted as consent. Additionally, consent should be appropriate to the age and capacity of the individual and other circumstances of the case. E.g., if an organisation \\"intends to continue to hold or use personal data after the relationship with the individual ends, then the consent should cover this.\\" And even when consent is given, it shouldn't be assumed to last forever. Although in most cases consent lasts for as long as the personal data needs to be processed, individuals may be able to withdraw their consent, depending on the nature of the consent and the circumstances in which the personal information is being collected and used. The Data Protection Act also specifies that sensitive personal data must be processed according to a stricter set of conditions, in particular any consent must be explicit. =Exceptions= The Act is structured such that all processing of personal data is covered by the act, while providing a number of exceptions in Part IV. Notable exceptions are: * Section 28 ‚Äì National security. Any processing for the purpose of safeguarding national security is exempt from all the data protection principles, as well as Part II (subject access rights), Part III (notification), Part V (enforcement), and Section 55 (Unlawful obtaining of personal data). * Section 29 ‚Äì Crime and taxation. Data processed for the prevention or detection of crime, the apprehension or prosecution of offenders, or the assessment or collection of taxes are exempt from the first data protection principle. * Section 36 ‚Äì Domestic purposes. Processing by an individual only for the purposes of that individual's personal, family or household affairs is exempt from all the data protection principles, as well as Part II (subject access rights) and Part III (notification). =Police and court powers= The Act grants or acknowledges various police and court powers. * Section 29 ‚Äì Consent of the Data Subject is not required when processing Personal Data to prevent or detect crime, apprehend or prosecute offenders, the assessment and collection of taxes and duties and to discharge a statutory function.Data Protection Act 1998, Part IV (Exceptions ‚Äì Crime and taxation), Section 29 * Section 35 ‚Äì Disclosures required by law or made in connection with legal proceedings.

Pearson Education Limited, 2005 While the basic principles are honoured for protecting privacy, interpreting the act is not always simple. Many companies, organisations and individuals seem very unsure of the aims, content and principles of the Act. Some hide behind the Act and refuse to provide even very basic, publicly available material quoting the Act as a restriction.Data Protection myths and realities, Information Commissioner's Office, accessed 30 August 2008 The Act also impacts on the way in which organisations conduct business in terms of who can be contacted for marketing purposes, not only by telephone and direct mail but also electronically, and has led to the development of permission based marketing strategies. =Definition of personal data= The definition of personal data is data relating to a living individual who can be identified * from that data or * from that data and other information in the possession of, or is likely to come into the possession of, the data controller Sensitive personal data concerns the subject's race, ethnicity, politics, religion, trade union status, health, sex life or criminal record. =Subject Access Requests= The Information Commissioner's Office website states regarding Subject Access Requests (SARs): \\"You have the right to find out if an organisation is using or storing your personal data. This is called the right of access. You exercise this right by asking for a copy of the data, which is commonly known as making a 'subject access request\\".

The recipient of many awards, including an Academy Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, and a Golden Globe, she was one of the highest-paid actresses in the world in 2015. Her films have earned over $6.8 billion worldwide, and she appeared in the Forbes Celebrity 100 list in 2009. Hathaway graduated from Millburn High School in New Jersey, where she acted in several plays. As a teenager, she was cast in the television series Get Real (1999‚Äì2000) and made her breakthrough as the protagonist in her debut film, the Disney comedy The Princess Diaries (2001). Hathaway made a transition to adult roles with the 2005 dramas Havoc and Brokeback Mountain. The comedy film The Devil Wears Prada (2006), in which she played an assistant to a fashion magazine editor, was her biggest commercial success to that point. She played a recovering alcoholic in the drama Rachel Getting Married (2008), which earned her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress. She followed this with roles in the commercially successful romantic films Bride Wars (2009), Valentine's Day (2010), Love & Other Drugs (2010), and the fantasy film Alice in Wonderland (2010). In 2012, Hathaway starred as Selina Kyle in her highest-grossing film The Dark Knight Rises, the final installment in The Dark Knight trilogy. That year, she also played Fantine, a prostitute dying of tuberculosis, in the musical romantic drama Les Mis√©rables, for which she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. She went on to play a scientist in the science fiction film Interstellar (2014), the owner of an online fashion site in the comedy The Intern (2015), and a haughty actress in the heist film Ocean's 8 (2018). Hathaway has also won an Emmy Award for providing her voice in The Simpsons, sung for soundtracks, appeared on stage, and hosted events. Hathaway supports several charities and causes. She is a board member of the Lollipop Theatre Network, an organization that brings films to sick children in hospitals, and advocates gender equality as a UN Women goodwill ambassador. She is married to businessman Adam Shulman, with whom she has two sons.  Early life  Anne Jacqueline Hathaway was born in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. Her father, Gerald, is a labor attorney, and her mother, Kate (n√©e McCauley), is a former actress. Hathaway's maternal grandfather was WIP (AM) Philadelphia radio personality Joe McCauley. Hathaway's mother is of Irish descent, and her father is of Irish, French, English, and German ancestry. She was named after Shakespeare's wife. She is the second of three children, with two brothers, one older, Michael, and one younger, Thomas. When she was six, her family moved to the Short HillsBonelli, Winnie. \\"From \\"Tiara Flicks\\" To English Romance\\" , The Independent, August 22, 2007.

At age six, when Hathaway watched her mother perform in Les Mis√©rables as Fantine, she instantly became fascinated with the stage, but her parents were not keen on allowing her to pursue an acting career. After this, Kate quit acting to raise Hathaway and her brothers. Hathaway was raised as Roman Catholic with what she considers \\"really strong values\\" and stated that she wished to be a nun during her childhood, but acting was always a high priority for her. At the age of 15, her relationship with the Catholic Church changed after she learned that her older brother, Michael, was gay. Her family left the church, converting to Episcopalianism because of its acceptance of homosexuality, but left that too. In 2009, Hathaway said her religious beliefs are \\"a work in progress\\". Hathaway attended Brooklyn Heights Montessori School and Wyoming Elementary School in Millburn. She graduated from Millburn High School, where she played soccer and participated in many plays, including Once Upon a Mattress, in which she portrayed Winnifred. Later, she appeared in other plays like Jane Eyre and Gigi, at New Jersey's Paper Mill Playhouse. She studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in 1993 and became the first teenager admitted into the Barrow Group Theater Company's acting program. She spent several semesters studying as an English major and political science minor at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York, before transferring to New York University's Gallatin School of Individualized Study. She has stated that she would have become either an English teacher or psychologist if she were not acting. Between 1998 and 1999, Hathaway sang soprano with the All-Eastern U.S. High School Honors Chorus at Carnegie Hall and in plays at Seton Hall Preparatory School in West Orange, New Jersey. At the start of her film career, her acting style and beauty were compared to Judy Garland‚Äîwhom she cites as one of her favorite actresses‚Äîand Audrey Hepburn. Three days after her performance at Carnegie Hall, Hathaway was cast in the short-lived Fox television series Get Real. Hathaway played the teenager Meghan Green alongside Jon Tenney, Debrah Farentino and Jesse Eisenberg. Despite her early success, Hathaway suffered from depression and anxiety as a teenager; she said in 2008 she had since grown from it. She missed her first college semester for the filming of her cinematic debut The Princess Diaries (2001). She says she never regretted not finishing her degree, as she enjoyed being with others who \\"were trying to grow up\\".  Career  = 2001‚Äì2004: Debut and breakthrough = The comedy The Princess Diaries and the adventure drama The Other Side of Heaven, both 2001 Disney films, featured Hathaway in lead roles. Based on Meg Cabot's 2000 novel of the same name, the former follows a teenager Mia Thermopolis (Hathaway) who discovers that she is the heir to the throne of the fictional Kingdom of Genovia. Hathaway auditioned for the role during a flight layover on the way to New Zealand. Garry Marshall, the film's director, initially considered Liv Tyler for the role, but cast Hathaway after his granddaughters suggested that she had the best \\"princess\\" hair. The film became a major commercial success, grossing $165 million worldwide. Many critics praised Hathaway's performance; a BBC critic noted that \\"Hathaway shines in the title role and generates great chemistry\\" and The New York Times Elvis Mitchell found her to be \\"royalty in the making, a young comic talent with a scramble of features\\". She earned an MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Female Performance nomination for the role. Hathaway starred with Christopher Gorham in Mitch Davis's The Other Side of Heaven. Inspired by John H. Groberg's memoir In the Eye of the Storm, the film met with mostly negative reviews and was a box-office failure. Owing to the success of The Princess Diaries, People magazine named Hathaway one of its breakthrough stars of 2001. In February 2002, Hathaway starred in the City Center Encores! concert production of Carnival! in her New York City stage debut. She played Lili, an optimistic orphan who falls in love with a magician. Before rehearsing with the full cast, Hathaway trained with a vocal coach for two weeks. She memorized almost all her lines and songs at the first read-through. Critics generally praised her for holding her own against well- known actors and heralded her as a new star. In a positive review for the musical, Charles Isherwood of Variety called Hathaway the highlight of the show and \\"remarkably unaffected and winning\\", praising her convincing performance. She won a Clarence Derwent Award for Most Promising Female. Later, Hathaway voiced the audiobook release of the first three books in The Princess Diaries novels. Hathaway portrayed princesses and appeared in family- oriented films over the next three years, subsequently becoming known in mainstream media as a children's role model. After voicing Haru Yoshioka for the English version of The Cat Returns (2002), she starred in Douglas McGrath's comedy-drama Nicholas Nickleby (2002), which opened to positive reviews. However, the film did not enter wide release and failed at the North American box office, totaling less than $4 million in ticket sales. The fantasy romantic comedy film Ella Enchanted (2004), in which Hathaway played the titular character, also performed poorly at the box office. She first read the book on which the film is based when she was 16, and stated that the script was originally much closer to the book, but did not work as a film, and therefore prefers the film the way it became. The film opened to mostly mixed reviews. Hathaway sang three songs on the film's soundtrack, including a duet with singer Jesse McCartney. In 2003, Hathaway declined the role for Joel Schumacher's The Phantom of the Opera (2004), because the production schedule of the film overlapped with The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement (2004). Hathaway was initially hesitant and nervous about starring in the sequel, but agreed to it after Marshall convinced her that she was not repeating anything. The film was released in August 2004 to negative reviews, but made $95.1 million against a $40-million budget. = 2005‚Äì2008: Transition to adult roles and greater success = In a 2008 article, Hathaway said that \\"anybody who was a role model for children needs a reprieve\\", but noted that \\"it's lovely to think that my audience is growing up with me\\". To avoid getting typecast, she began taking on adult roles. After replacing Tara Strong for the voice role of Red Puckett in Hoodwinked! (2005), she starred in the drama Havoc (2005) as a spoiled socialite, appearing nude in some of its scenes. Although the film was thematically different from her previous films, Hathaway denied that her role was an attempt to be seen as a more mature actress, citing her belief that doing nudity in certain films is merely a part of what her chosen form of art demands of her; and because of that belief she does not consider appearing nude in appropriate films to be morally objectionable. The film was not released in theaters in the United States due to unfavorable critical reception. Hathaway starred alongside Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal in Ang Lee's drama Brokeback Mountain (2005). The film depicts the emotional and sexual relationship between two married men, Ennis (Ledger) and Jack (Gyllenhaal); Hathaway played Jack's wife. She was originally sent the script with the role of Alma, Ennis' wife, but decided to audition for Lureen once she read the screenplay. During her audition, Hathaway lied to Lee about her knowledge of horse riding so he would cast her, but she did subsequently take lessons. The film received positive reviews from critics and several Academy Award nominations. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone believed that Hathaway \\"excels at showing Lureen's journey from cutie-pie to hard case\\", and Todd McCarthy of Variety said she \\"provides an entertaining contrast in wifely disappointment\\". Hathaway later stated that the content of the film was more important than its award count and that making it made her more aware of the kind of stories she wanted to tell as an actress. At that point, she realized that she wanted to play roles to move her audiences or otherwise entertain them so much that they forget about their own lives. Hathaway at the 2007 alt=A picture of Anne Hathaway looking to her left into the camera. In 2006, she starred in David Frankel's comedy film The Devil Wears Prada, as an assistant to the powerful fashion magazine editor Miranda Priestly, played by Meryl Streep. Hathaway said that working on the film made her respect the fashion industry a great deal more than she had previously, though she said her personal style was something she \\"still can't get right\\". She also stated that she and co-star Emily Blunt got so hungry on their weight-loss regimen for the film it made them cry. To prepare for the role, Hathaway volunteered for a few weeks as an assistant at an auction house. The film received positive reviews; Roger Ebert called Hathaway \\"a great beauty [...] who makes a convincing career girl\\" and Rotten Tomatoes found \\"Streep in top form and Anne Hathaway more than holding her own\\". The Devil Wears Prada became Hathaway's biggest commercial success to this point, grossing more than $326.5 million worldwide. Hathaway was cast in Knocked Up, but dropped out before filming began and was replaced by Katherine Heigl. According to writer- director Judd Apatow, this happened because Hathaway was uncomfortable with the use of real footage of a woman giving birth; Hathaway believed it did not contribute to the film's story. Her only release in 2007 was the biographical romantic drama Becoming Jane, as the titular English author Jane Austen. A fan of Austen since she was fourteen, Hathaway prepared for the role by rereading Austen's books and conducting historical research, such as perusing the author's letters; she also learned sign language, calligraphy, dance choreography, and the piano. She moved to England a month before production began to improve her English accent. The film received mixed reviews from critics; some reviewers negatively focused on Hathaway's performance and accent. Regardless, Hathaway received a British Independent Film Award for Best Actress nomination for the film. In October 2008, Hathaway hosted the NBC late-night sketch comedy Saturday Night Live. She also starred in Peter Segal's film adaptation of Mel Brooks' television series Get Smart, in which she played Agent 99. Considering the role to be \\"a childhood dream come true\\", Hathaway learned martial arts and dancing techniques in preparation. While filming an action sequence, Hathaway split the flesh of her shin to the bone, which led to her receiving 15 stitches. The film, centering on an analyst who dreams of becoming a real field agent and a better spy, was a financial success. Hathaway's following film, the American-Canadian mystery thriller Passengers alongside Patrick Wilson, was a critical and commercial failure. She then starred with Debra Winger in Rachel Getting Married as Kym, a young woman, who after being released from drug rehabilitation, returns home for her sister's wedding. She described her character as \\"narcissistic‚Äîdownright selfish\\". Rachel Getting Married premiered at the 2008 Venice and Toronto International Film Festivals and Hathaway garnered widespread acclaim for her performance. Peter Travers called Hathaway \\"raw and riveting as Kym\\" and added that she \\"acts the hell out of it, achieving a state of sorrowful grace.\\" Hathaway's performance garnered nominations for an Academy Award for Best Actress and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress ‚Äì Drama. = 2009‚Äì2011: Romantic films and hosting events = Hathaway starred in Bride Wars (2009), which she described as \\"hideously commercial‚Äîgloriously so\\". The romantic comedy, in which she and Kate Hudson played two best friends who become rivals after their weddings are scheduled on the same day, was a critical failure; it was named among the 10 worst chick flicks in history by Time in 2010. Despite this, the film was successful financially and earned Hathaway an MTV Movie Award for Best Female Performance nomination. She played the heroine Viola in a summer 2009 production of Twelfth Night at the Delacorte Theater in New York City. Charles Isherwood opined that Hathaway \\"dives smoothly and with obvious pleasure into the embrace of a cohesive ensemble cast\\". For her interpretation of the role, she garnered a nomination for the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actress in a Play. In 2010, she also won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for providing her voice for the episode \\"Once Upon a Time in Springfield\\" in The Simpsons. Hathaway voiced different characters in Family Guy in 2010 and 2011. Hathaway at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert (in 2010), which she hosted with actor Denzel Washington In 2010, Hathaway appeared as a receptionist who dates a clerk (played by Topher Grace) in the ensemble romantic comedy Valentine's Day, directed by Garry Marshall. The film was a commercial success, grossing more than $215 million worldwide against a budget of $52 million. Hathaway played the White Queen in Tim Burton's 2010 adaptation of the fantasy novels Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass alongside Helena Bonham Carter and Johnny Depp. She summed up her character with a caption on a magnet of Happy Bunny holding a knife; \\"Cute but psycho. Things even out.\\" Hathaway described her interpretation of the White Queen as \\"a punk-rock vegan pacifist\\", drawing inspiration from Debbie Harry and the artwork of Dan Flavin. Alice in Wonderland received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its visuals, but criticized its lack of narrative coherence. Commercially, the film grossed $1 billion to become the second highest-grossing movie of 2010. Hathaway starred alongside Jake Gyllenhaal as a free-spirited artist suffering from Parkinson's disease in Edward Zwick's erotic romantic comedy-drama Love & Other Drugs, based on the non-fiction book Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman by Jamie Reidy. For the role, Hathaway spent time with a Parkinson's patient to research the disease. Preparing for the film's nude scenes, she watched the work of the actresses Kate Winslet and Pen√©lope Cruz who, in her opinion, have done nudity with sensitivity and dignity. Hathaway believed that these scenes would not discourage socially conservative people from watching the film. Critics generally praised the film's adult romance but were unenthusiastic about its plot elements. Hathaway's performance, which Ebert called \\"warm, lovable\\", earned her a Satellite Award and a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress ‚Äì Comedy or Musical. Together with actor Denzel Washington, Hathaway hosted the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo, Norway in December 2010. Two months later, she and James Franco hosted the 83rd Academy Awards. Critics were unenthusiastic about their chemistry, but thought Hathaway gave her best and did a better job than Franco, who they felt seemed uninterested. At the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards, she garnered an Outstanding Variety Special (Live) nomination. In 2011, Hathaway voiced Jewel, a female Spix's macaw from Rio de Janeiro, in the animated film Rio, produced by 20th Century Fox and Blue Sky Studios. The film received generally positive reviews from film critics, who praised the visuals, voice acting and music. A commercial success, it grossed more than $484 million worldwide against a budget of $90 million. Later, Hathaway starred alongside Jim Sturgess in Lone Scherfig's One Day, based on David Nicholls' 2009 novel of the same name. The film tells the story of two young people who meet twenty years after they shared a one-night stand together. Hathaway was clandestinely given the script, as One Day was set in the UK, and Scherfig was not looking for any American actresses for the part. After a nonproductive meeting with Scherfig, Hathaway left a list of songs for her, who after listening to them, cast the actress for the part. In an interview with Peter Travers, Hathaway said she might have inadvertently encouraged misogyny as she did not trust Scherfig as a director, which she felt was because of her gender. Hathaway's Yorkshire accent in the film was considered subpar. Columnist Suzanne Moore, reviewing the film on BBC Radio 4's Front Row, said Hathaway's accents were \\"all over the shop\\", adding, \\"Sometimes she's from Scotland, sometimes she's from New York, you just can't tell\\". The film itself received polarized reviews from critics, but became a moderate box office success. = 2012‚Äì2014: Les Mis√©rables and films with Christopher Nolan = In 2012, Hathaway's audiobook recording of L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz was released at Audible.com and garnered her a nomination for an Audie Award for Best Solo Narration ‚Äì Female. Later in 2012, Hathaway played sly, morally ambiguous cat burglar Selina Kyle in The Dark Knight Rises, Christopher Nolan's final installment in The Dark Knight trilogy. Hathaway auditioned not knowing what role she was being considered for, admitting that she had one character in mind, but only learned her role after talking with Nolan for an hour. She described the role as the most physically demanding she had ever played, as she had to redouble her efforts in the gym to keep up with the requirements of the role. Hathaway trained extensively in martial arts for the role, and looked to Hedy Lamarr in developing her role as Catwoman. The Dark Knight Rises received a positive critical response and grossed more than $1.085 billion worldwide, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 2012. A review published in IGN wrote of her \\"magnetic presence\\", adding, \\"Hathaway imbues her [character] with a wounded spirit and a survivor's edge that makes her feel genuine and sympathetic\\". Hathaway won the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance. Hathaway at alt=A short-haired brunette, wearing a black dress, is smiling to her left Hathaway played Fantine, a prostitute dying of tuberculosis, in Tom Hooper's film Les Mis√©rables, which was based on the musical of the same name. Footage of Hathaway singing \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\", a song from the film, was shown at CinemaCon in April 2012. Hooper described Hathaway's singing as \\"raw\\" and \\"real\\". Preparing for the role, Hathaway consumed fewer than 500 calories a day to lose , researched prostitution and cut her hair. To get into the character's mental space alone during filming in London, Hathaway sent her husband back to the US; this resulted in her becoming increasingly temperamental. Christopher Orr from The Atlantic wrote that \\"Hathaway gives it everything she has, beginning in quiet sorrow before building to a woebegone climax: she gasps, she weeps, she coughs.\\" Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post wrote that \\"the centerpiece of a movie composed entirely of centerpieces belongs to Anne Hathaway, who as the tragic heroine Fantine sings another of the memorable numbers\\". For the film, Hathaway won an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, a Screen Actors Guild and a BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actress. Asked if she was pleased with her performance in the film, Hathaway expressed doubts, replying with \\"Eh\\". In January 2013, Hathaway's rendition of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" reached number 69 on the Billboard Hot 100. After briefly appearing in the romantic comedy Don Jon (2013), Hathaway starred in and co- produced (with her husband and others) Song One. In the drama film, she played an anthropology student who returns home to see her injured brother, Henry (played by Ben Rosenfield), and soon begins a romantic relationship with his favorite musician, James Forester (played by Johnny Flynn). Hathaway's character was initially written as 19 years old, but Kate Barker-Froyland, the film's writer and director, changed the part to that of an older woman after casting Hathaway. Hathaway says that the reason she decided to produce the film was because of its depiction of the healing power of music and second chances. For the film's soundtrack, she provided her voice for the song \\"Afraid of Heights\\". Song One premiered in the U.S. Dramatic Competition at the 30th Sundance Film Festival in January 2014, and released in theaters the following year to mixed reviews from critics. Commercially, the film failed to recover its $6-million budget. Hathaway reprised her role as Jewel in the animated film Rio 2‚Äîher third film with Jamie Foxx‚Äîwhich was released in 2014. It grossed about five times more than its $103-million budget. Hathaway's only live action film in 2014 was Christopher Nolan's epic science fiction film Interstellar. Set in a dystopian future where humanity is struggling to survive, the film follows a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole in search of a new home for humanity. With a budget of $165 million, the high- profile production, co-starring Matthew McConaughey and Jessica Chastain, was filmed partially using IMAX cameras. Hathaway was drawn to her character's growth from an arrogant to a humbler person. While filming a water scene in Iceland, Hathaway almost suffered hypothermia because the dry suit she was wearing had not been properly secured. Critics for The Independent and Empire wrote that she was \\"affecting\\" as a scientist unable to decide between her professional responsibilities and her feelings and played it with \\"soulful nuance\\". Interstellar, which earned more than $675 million worldwide, earned Hathaway a nomination for a Saturn Award for Best Actress. =2015‚Äìpresent: Comedic roles= Hathaway began 2015 with an appearance in the first season of the musical reality show Lip Sync Battle. In the episode, she competed against her ' costar Emily Blunt; she lip synced \\"Love\\" by Mary J. Blige and \\"Wrecking Ball\\" by Miley Cyrus. Nancy Meyers' The Intern was Hathaway's only film work in 2015. The film tells the story of Ben Whittaker (played by Robert DeNiro), a seventy-year-old widower who becomes a senior intern at an online fashion site run by Hathaway's character, Jules Ostin. Hathaway aspired to work with DeNiro and Meyers, her favorite actor and director, respectively; impressed with the film's story, she auditioned for the third time for a Meyers film. Reviews for the film were generally positive; one in Ebert's website found her \\"extremely appealing\\" and a reviewer in Vulture wrote \\"The Intern gets off on De Niro's amiability and Hathaway's sweet energy\\". Against a production budget of $35 million, the film grossed $194 million worldwide. The 2015 found footage horror movie Be My Cat: A Film for Anne, about an aspiring Romanian filmmaker who goes to shocking extremes to convince Hathaway to star in his film, was officially selected and had its North American premiere in April 2016 at the Nashville Film Festival. Hathaway promoting Ocean's 8 in 2018 Hathaway reprised the role of the White Queen in Alice Through the Looking Glass, the 2016 sequel to Alice in Wonderland. That March, it was reported that she would reprise her role for The Princess Diaries 3; the project was shelved after the death of Gary Marshall, who was set to direct the film. Hathaway is one of several actors featured on Barbra Streisand's 2016 album Encore: Movie Partners Sing Broadway. Along with Daisy Ridley, Hathaway and Streisand performed the song \\"At The Ballet\\" from A Chorus Line; Hathaway played the role of Maggie, one of a trio of dancers hoping to be cast in an upcoming show. Her final film that year was alongside Jason Sudeikis in Nacho Vigalondo's science fiction black comedy film Colossal (2016). Playing an unemployed young writer, Hathaway was the first actress to sign on at a time when the project had no financial backing. She found herself attracted to the genre-hopping nature of the script, later comparing it to Being John Malkovich (1999), one of her favorite films. The film received positive reviews from critics, but earned only $4 million at the box office. After a two-year absence from the screen, Hathaway starred as a famous actress in the all- female spin-off of the Ocean's Eleven franchise, Ocean's 8, directed by Gary Ross. Co-starring Sandra Bullock and Cate Blanchett, the film follows a group of criminals who plan to rob the Met Gala. Hathaway said she found it fun to play someone with an immense ego and saw the role as an opportunity \\"to lean into all the ridiculous fame nonsense that I've been trying to side-step for all of these years.\\" Hathaway hoped that the film would be profitable so that it could debunk claims that films with female protagonists do not succeed commercially. Many critics felt that Hathaway's performance overshadowed those of her co-stars'; ABC Online's Jason Di Rosso wrote she \\"shines in [a] disappointing\\" spin-off, adding, \\"the film's best moments belong to Hathaway as the anxiety-ridden, vain and capricious starlet. She's the only successful meld of comedy and pathos‚Äîa victim of the celebrity treadmill who is also capable of outsmarting it.\\" The film became a box office success, earning a total of over $297 million worldwide on a production budget of $70 million. Hathaway's first two films of 2019‚Äîthe thriller Serenity and the comedy The Hustle‚Äîwere poorly reviewed by critics. In the former, she appeared alongside Matthew McConaughey as a woman who tasks her ex-husband to kill her new abusive husband, a role for which she dyed her hair blonde. The Washington Post criticized her performance as \\"cartoonish\\", writing that her femme fatale character was reminiscent of \\"a kind of live-action Jessica Rabbit\\". The latter film was a remake of the 1988 film Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, co-starring Rebel Wilson, which emerged as a sleeper hit. Hathaway next played a woman with bipolar disorder in an episode of the Prime Video romantic anthology series Modern Love. She then played the wife of Mark Ruffalo's character in Todd Haynes's legal drama Dark Waters, about environmental poisoning done by the chemical company DuPont. Writing for Variety, Owen Gleiberman labeled her supporting performance \\"a piercing dance of agony and loyalty\\". Hathaway began the new decade with the political thriller The Last Thing He Wanted (2020), based on the book of the same name by Joan Didion. She considered herself to be an unlikely choice for the part of a headstrong journalist, as it differed from her own \\"puppy dog\\" personality. It received negative reviews from critics. Hathaway will next star in The Witches, an adaptation of the novel of the same name from director Robert Zemeckis, and will play a leading role in a film based on the Sesame Street franchise. She will also star in an adaptation of Pamela Druckerman's book Bringing Up B√©b√©: One American Mother Discovers the Wisdom of French Parenting.  Personal life  Hathaway at alt=Anne Hathaway is smilin to her right in the black-and-white picture. In 2004, Hathaway began a romantic relationship with Italian real estate developer Raffaello Follieri. Follieri's Manhattan-based foundation, established in 2003, focused on efforts such as providing vaccinations for children in poor countries. In June 2008, it was investigated by the IRS for failure to file required nonprofit information forms. In June 2008, Follieri was arrested on charges of defrauding investors out of millions of dollars in a scheme in which he posed as the Vatican's real-estate agent. It was reported that the FBI confiscated Hathaway's private journals from Follieri's New York City apartment as part of their ongoing investigation into Follieri's activities. Hathaway was not charged with any crime. In October 2008, after earlier pleading guilty, Follieri was sentenced to four and a half years in prison. Hathaway married actor and businessman Adam Shulman on September 29, 2012, in Big Sur, California, in a traditional Jewish ceremony. She gave birth to their first son, Jonathan Rosebanks Shulman, on March 24, 2016. That year, Hathaway purchased an apartment worth $2.55 million on the Upper West Side, a neighborhood in Manhattan where she lives with Shulman and their child. Hathaway and Shulman sold their wedding photo and donated its profits to same- sex marriage advocacy group Freedom to Marry. They also hosted Freedom to Marry's National Engagement Party, an event which raised $500,000. In July 2019, Hathaway announced via social media they were expecting their second child, and spoke about her struggles with conception and infertility. She gave birth to their second son, Jack Shulman, in November 2019. In early 2007, Hathaway spoke of her experiences with depression during her teenage years, saying that she eventually overcame the disorder without medication. In 2008, she began smoking after a stressful summer and the end of her relationship with Follieri. She credited quitting smoking for the subsequent decline in her stress level and returned to being vegetarian. Although Hathaway became a vegan in early 2012, she quit while filming Interstellar in August 2014.  Activism and political work  Hathaway has served as a long-term advocate for the Nike Foundation to raise awareness against child marriage. In July 2006, she spent a week in Nicaragua to help vaccinate children against hepatitis A. She has also traveled to other countries to heed the rights of women and girls, including Kenya and Ethiopia. In 2008, she was honored at Elle magazine's \\"Women in Hollywood\\" tribute and won an award from the Human Rights Campaign for her philanthropy; she was also honored for her work with Step Up Women's Network in 2008. She then teamed up in 2010 with World Bank in a two- year development program The Girl Effect whose mission focuses on helping empower girls in developing and developed nations where one-third of young women are not employed and not in school. In 2013, she provided the narration for Girl Rising, a CNN documentary film, which focused on the power of female education as it followed seven girls around the world who sought to overcome obstacles and follow their dreams. Hathaway currently serves on the board of the Lollipop Theatre Network and is involved with charities Creative Coalition, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and the Human Rights Campaign. She is a supporter of LGBT rights and has donated money to organizations that support same sex marriage. In 2016, Hathaway was appointed UN Women Goodwill ambassador based on her advocacy for gender equality. The following year, she spoke on International Women's Day in favor of paid parental leave for both men and women. To promote an increased awareness of systemic sexism in the entertainment industry, Hathaway has advocated for greater professional opportunities for women and criticized Hollywood as not being a place for equality. In 2018, she collaborated with 300 women in Hollywood to set up the Time's Up initiative to protect women from harassment and discrimination. Hathaway has also spoken out against the issues of bullying of gay students, discrimination toward transgender children, and white supremacy.  In the media  John Hiscock of The Daily Telegraph finds Hathaway a \\"well-grounded, friendly young woman with a good sense of humour, a wide smile and an easy-going attitude\\". He says that despite considerable success Hathaway has never \\"gone Hollywood\\", staying close to her friends. The authors of the book 365 Style note Hathaway's girl next door image and Nancy Meyers (who directed her in The Intern) says she is \\"wise beyond her years\\". Laura Brown in Harper's Bazaar considers her to be a \\"sincere\\", \\"warm and funny\\" woman. After her Golden Globe acceptance speech for Les Mis√©rables, some members of the media began to dismiss her as \\"too-actress-y, over-eager\\" and inauthentic. Addressing this, Hathaway said in 2014 that she feels anxious speaking to the public, but has since grown from it and become a more compassionate person. Regarding her perceived image, she says, \\"People have this idea of me as just being a very prim, professional girl, which I suppose I am, but I do cut loose and have fun in my life\\". Hathaway at the Miami International Film Festival in 2014 In a review of her work in Twelfth Night, Charles Isherwood wrote, \\"on screen or onstage Ms. Hathaway possesses the unmistakable glow of a natural star\\". An Esquire writer says many of her good performances have been overlooked, describing her career as \\"subtle brilliance that has largely gone unnoticed\\". Discussing her career in 2015, Hathaway said that after her breakthrough in The Princess Diaries, she struggled to find serious roles or ones that were not about princesses. According to Judi Gugliemli of People, Hathaway used this fear of being typecast as motivation to build a versatile body of work. Gugliemli believes that Hathaway's ability to extensively research her roles is the key to her success. A writer for The Daily Telegraph commends her willingness to appear in different genres, ranging from action comedies to dramas. Hathaway aspires to appear in many different films, work with different directors and play diverse roles. She says she would be \\"lost\\" without acting and feels lucky to have found it as her profession. A trained stage actress, she prefers performing on stage to film roles and claims to be terrified of acting in front of camera. \\"I always assume that every film is my last, and I always assume that I have to go out and convince everybody why they have to hire me. I still audition\\", she explains. Forbes reported Hathaway as one of the highest paid actresses of 2015, and since 2017 she is among the highest-grossing actresses of the 21st century. In 2009, Hathaway was included in Forbes annual list of Celebrity 100 with earnings of $7 million, and was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Analyzing her earnings in 2010, the magazine included her in Hollywood's Best Actors for the Buck, the highest return profit among actresses. By October 2017, her films had grossed $6.4 billion worldwide. Profiled as among the world's leading actresses by Vanity Fair, Hathaway, according to Catherine Elsworth of The Daily Telegraph, is pursued both by directors and by cosmetics companies. In January 2008, she joined French luxury perfumes and cosmetics house Lanc√¥me as the face of their fragrance Magnifique. In 2011, Hathaway became the new face of the Italian company Tod's. Hathaway's sex appeal has been picked up by several media outlets; FHM, People, AskMen, Maxim, Empire and Entertainment Weekly have included her in their yearly lists of sexiest women. In 2011, Los Angeles Times Magazine listed her as one of the 50 Most Beautiful Women in Film. Elsworth called her in 2008 \\"the hottest young actress in Hollywood\\". Hathaway disagreed, insisting that she has a \\"good girl\\" image and no sex appeal. She has refused to undergo Botox, saying that she is comfortable in her own skin.  Works and accolades  Hathaway's most acclaimed and highest-grossing films, according to the online portal Box Office Mojo and the review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes, include The Princess Diaries (2001), Brokeback Mountain (2005), The Devil Wears Prada (2006), Get Smart (2008), Rachel Getting Married (2008), Valentine's Day (2010), Alice in Wonderland (2010), Love and Other Drugs (2010), The Dark Knight Rises (2012), Les Mis√©rables (2012), Interstellar (2014), The Intern (2015), Colossal (2016), and Ocean's 8 (2018). Hathaway has been nominated for two Academy Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, and a British Academy Film Award. She has won an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, a Screen Actors Guild and a BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actress for Les Mis√©rables. She has also won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for her voice role in a 2010 episode of The Simpsons. In November 2018, Hathaway was one of 50 nominees for the New Jersey Hall of Fame, an organization that honors contributions to society and the world beyond. In May 2019, Hathaway received a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her contributions to the film industry.\\"Hollywood Walk of Fame ‚Äì Upcoming Star Ceremonies\\". walkoffame.com (archive).

The largest of the sirens and one of the largest amphibians in North America, the greater siren resides in the coastal plains of the southeastern United States.  Description  S. lacertina is paedomorphic, as are all sirens. They lack hindlimbs as well as a pelvic girdle, and have external gills all throughout their lives along with small lungs. They lack eyelids, and have an unfused pectoral girdle. Greater sirens measure around in length upon hatching and then grow to lengths ranging from . Weight can range from . Coloration varies throughout their range, but they are generally an olive or gray color with small yellow or green dots on their sides. They have about 36 to 40 costal grooves between their armpits and their cloaca. Younger sirens also have a light stripe along their sides, which fades with age. The front legs, each with four toes, are so small that they can be hidden in the gills. In terms of sensory organs, greater sirens rely on both a modified Jacobson's organ and a lateral line system over their small eyes. It is possible that they are capable of sensing disturbances in electrical fields. Siren_Lacertina_Skeleton_(3).jpgGreater siren skull & hyoid Siren_Lacertina_Skeleton_(2).jpgGreater siren skeleton  Behavior  Greater siren out of water Greater sirens are carnivorous and prey upon invertebrates and aquatic vertebrates with a possible preference for molluscs, although they have been observed to eat vegetation. They are nocturnal and spend the day in dense vegetation. Their lifespan in the wild is unknown, but in captivity they can live up to 25 years. Greater sirens can vocalize, producing clicks or yelps sounding similar to the call of the American green tree frog. They are able to aestivate for multiple years if necessary, burrowing into mud and exuding a cocoon of dead skin cells. Known predators include the American alligator and the mud snake. Their spermatozoa possess a pair of flagella, and their courtship behavior is unknown. Mating occurs in February and March, with mothers guarding clutches of eggs that hatch about two months later. Youth live in shallower water than adults, often among the roots of water hyacinths.  Distribution  They inhabit the coastal plain from Washington, D.C., to Florida and Alabama. A population of sirens in the Rio Grande has been tentatively determined to be S. lacertina. Greater sirens live in wetlands, preferring those with a slow or nonexistent current and a thick layer of organic material. They are capable of inhabiting seasonal and permanent wetlands given their ability to aestivate, and will burrow into mud if their wetland dries up.  Conservation  Greater sirens are classified as Least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, although they have been extirpated from some of their former range due to habitat loss. They are protected under Mexican law and are assigned to the \\"Special Protection\\" category.

There are six species, sugar glider, squirrel glider, mahogany glider, northern glider, yellow-bellied glider and Biak glider, and are native to Australia or New Guinea. Flying phalangers are typically nocturnal, most being small (sometimes around 400 mm, counting the tail), and have folds of loose skin (patagia) running from the wrists to the ankles. They use the patagia to glide from tree to tree by jumping and holding out their limbs spread-eagle. They are able to glide for distances over 140 metres. Beside the distinctive skin folds, flying phalangers also have large, forward- facing eyes, short (though pointed) faces, and long flat tails which are used as rudders while gliding. All are omnivores, and eat tree sap, gum, nectar, pollen, and insects, along with manna and honeydew. Most flying phalangers appear to be solitary, though the yellow-bellied glider and sugar glider are both known to live in groups. Conservation status While Biak and sugar gliders are relatively common, most of the other species are rare. Mahogany gliders are Australia's most threatened species and is list as endangered, and so uncommon that they weren't seen for more than a hundred years after their original discovery in 1883. Nearly a month after they were rediscovered in 1989, their habitat was cleared for plantations, and another population wasn't found until 1991. The reason for the Mahogany gliders endangerment are habitat loss, limited distribution, lack of habitat protected, as well as degradation of its habitat due to its transition. Along with Mahogany gliders being endangered the squirrel gliders (petaurus norfolcensis) are endangered as well.

Because he was a child prodigy, he was sometimes called the Mozart of classical Indian music. He was awarded the Padma Shri in 1998, by the Government of India. He was also awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 2009 given by Sangeet Natak Akademi, which is the National Academy of Music, Dance & Drama, in India. Early life and background Srinivas was born 28 February 1969, in Palakollu in Andhra Pradesh. At the age of five, he picked up his father U. Satyanarayana's mandolin, after he heard it being played at a concert he attended with his father. Upon realizing the talent of his son, his father, who had studied classical music, bought him a new mandolin, and started teaching him. Guitarist Vasu Rao, introduced seven-year-old Srinivas to western music in 1976. Soon, Satyanarayana's guru, Rudraraju Subbaraju, (disciple of Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavathar) who had also taught Srinivas' father and Vasu Rao, recognized the potential of the young Srinivas and started teaching him. Since Rudraraju Subbaraju did not know how to play the mandolin, he would just sing pieces from the Carnatic classical repertoire, and U. Srinivas, all of six, would play them on the mandolin, thus developing a phenomenal style of playing entirely his own, and astonishingly, on an instrument that had never been played in the rigorous and difficult Carnatic style before. Soon, the family moved to Chennai, the hotspot of Carnatic music, where most Carnatic musicians live. When Srinivas gave his first performance it led to him being compared to the world's greatest prodigies: \\"Some of you have heard or read about exceptionally gifted children, our own Mandolin Srinivas, Sir Yehudi Menuhin, Beethoven, Sir Isaac Newton, Picasso, Madam Curie, the list is endless.\\" At a young age he was internationally viewed as the successor to Pandit Ravi Shankar. Career He made his debut public Carnatic concert performance in 1978 during the Thyagaraja Aradhana festival at Gudivada in Andhra Pradesh. Thereafter, at age eleven, in 1981, he gave his first public concert in Chennai at the Indian Fine Arts Society during the December Music Season, and never looked back. The skeptics were convinced and soon mesmerized, connoisseurs fell in love with him, and patrons of the arts could not have enough of him. At age eleven, a star was born, who was both revered and adored. He started off playing the acoustic mandolin, but he later switched to the electric mandolin as he felt it allowed the playing of lengthy, sustained notes - the quintessential component in classical Indian music - in addition to making them clearly audible. George Harrison's favorite piece of Indian music was Mandolin Ecstasy. \\"It was, like, my dad's favourite album of all time,\\" says (Dhani) Harrison. \\"U Srinivas is 27 now and still making music. He plays an electric five-string mandolin, he's fantastic....\\" Over his career, he toured across the world, and collaborated with John McLaughlin, Michael Nyman, and Michael Brook. Remember Shakti Concert, Munich, Germany (2001) (left to right) U. Srinivas, John McLaughlin, V. Selvaganesh He was the first musician to use the electric mandolin in Carnatic music: he modified the electric western instrument, using five single strings instead of the traditional four doubled strings to suit the Carnatic pitch, raga system, and especially gamakas, or nuanced oscillations. After initial reluctance, he found wide acceptance and critical acclaim in the following decades. Starting in 1982, he performed regularly during the December season of the prestigious Madras Music Academy, performing there every year except in 2002 - December 23 of each year was a reserved slot for U. Srinivas - the highest accolade. Srinivas stormed the world music scene at age thirteen at the Berlin Jazz Festival. Initially booked to play a half-hour concert after Miles Davis, Srinivas so enthralled the audience in Berlin that he won a standing ovation, and had to play for another hour. \\"He's got it in him. He's fantastic,\\" raved the legendary Don Cherry at the time. Guitarist John McLaughlin first heard a tape of this concert by the thirteen-year-old prodigy, and was left very impressed. He played at the Olympic Arts Festival, Barcelona in 1992 and in 1995 recorded a successful fusion album with Michael Brook. When John McLaughlin revived his group Shakti, and renamed it Remember Shakti, in 1997, he asked Srinivas to join the group and tour the world with it, along with other celebrated Indian musicians Zakir Hussain, Shankar Mahadevan, and V. Selvaganesh. Srinivas, of course, was the undisputed superstar of the group. Srinivas toured extensively across the world, in his own right, as a prodigy and leading star from the classical Indian music firmament, receiving thunderous applause and appreciation wherever he performed - he played in Australia, Southeast Asia, Southwest Asia, and extensively and frequently across the United States and Canada. Soon, the mandolin became synonymous with Srinivas and he started being called Mandolin Srinivas. Thus, Srinivas stands as a trailblazer and pioneer, who introduced and adapted an unlikely western instrument, the mandolin, at age six, and made it suitable for performing in the rigorous Carnatic style of music, in the same manner that the violin had been introduced into Carnatic classical music some two hundred years before. His gifted younger brother, U. Rajesh, has studied with Srinivas for some twenty-seven years, and is also an accomplished mandolin player, who has often accompanied him at concerts over the last twenty years. He also plays jazz and western music, and played the mandolin in the John Mclaughlin album 'Floating Point' which received a Grammy nomination in the Best Contemporary Jazz Album Category in 2008. Srinivas and Rajesh have together composed music as well, and, besides Carnatic music, they have extensively worked on the fusion of Carnatic and western music. They also played with the Johannesburg Philharmonic Orchestra, with French electric bass player Dominique Di Piazza, pianist Anil Srinivasan and Stephen Devassy, a pianist from Kerala. In 2008, they collaborated again with John Mclaughlin for the album Samjanitha, which also featured Zakir Hussain, Sivamani, and George Brook. Srinivas compared Carnatic music to the Sanskrit language, \\"It's the basis, from which spring so many other languages. Carnatic music is here to stay with us and all other music that we play is based on that.\\" Over the years, Srinivas recorded over 137 albums, in diverse genres from Carnatic music solos to jugalbandis with Hindustani musicians, and world music. He performed with Western artists such as John McLaughlin, Michael Brook, Trey Gunn, Nigel Kennedy, Nana Vasconcelos, and Michael Nyman, as well as with Hindustani music artists such as Hariprasad Chaurasia and Zakir Hussain, besides Carnatic artists like Vikku Vinayakram and V. Selvaganesh. U. Srinivas started a music school called the Srinivas Institute of World Music (SIOWM) in Chennai, where, since he was barely eighteen, he taught a number of students gratis. Srinivas has trained almost a hundred students worldwide, many of whom have studied with him and U. Rajesh for as long as ten years. U. Rajesh continues teaching their students at the SIOWM. Instrument Srinivas' first mandolin belonged to his father, a clarinetist. That instrument was a 'standard' Western mandolin; however, he made modifications to suit his playing style over the course of his musical career. Srinivas started out on the acoustic mandolin, but neither the size nor plucking required of the acoustic mandolin was suited for long, sustained notes. He then switched to the electric mandolin, which was better suited for sustained notes and musical ornamentations. Unlike a typical mandolin's eight strings, tuned to GG-DD-AA-EE, Srinivas generally used only five strings tuned to CGCGC. Copies of this style of mandolin are available in India, and several other Indian mandolin players have used instruments just like it (including Suresh Kumar, Raghavendra, and his brother, U.Rajesh). Personal life Srinivas married U. Sree, daughter of a vigilance officer from Andhra Pradesh, and veena player, in 1994. The couple had a son, Sai Krishna (also known as Naani Krissh, a director who made his directorial debut with Opperah in 2017), and were divorced in 2012. After their divorce U. Sree received custody of their son. U.Srinivas was an ardent devotee of the Paramacharya of Kanchi. He was also a follower and devotee of Sri Sathya Sai Baba and had performed before him on several occasions. Illness and death A non-smoker, teetotaler and vegetarian all his life, Srinivas had undergone a liver transplant on 11 September 2014 and was recovering when complications arose on the evening of 18 September. He died at 9.30AM on 19 September 2014, due to liver failure at Apollo Hospital, Chennai. He is survived by his parents, sisters, brother Mandolin U. Rajesh, his former wife and a son.

He served as Deputy Speaker of the Parliament of Iran and was one of the founders of the reformist party Mojahedin of the Islamic Revolution Organization. Prior to his career as a democratic reformist, Nabavi was considered an ideologue of the Iranian Islamic left until that force was sidelined by conservatives in the 1990s. Early life Nabavi was born in Tehran in 1941. His father was a historian, He graduated from Amir Kabir University of Technology with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering in the mid-1960s. He received a master's degree in electrical engineering in 1964. Career and activities Nabavi started his political activity as a guerrilla fighter against the Pahlavi government and served a prison term as a result. He has personally confirmed that when he was arrested in 1972, he had tried suicide by swallowing a cyanide pill, which \\"fortunately or unfortunately\\" did not work. During the Islamic Revolution he was among the founders of the Islamic Revolution Committees (known as komite or komiteh in Iran) which served as a security force mainly working against armed opposition parties and militia, the early years of the Islamic Republic. Nabavi was also a founder of the intelligence office under the Presidency, which later became the ministry of intelligence. Nabavi acted as the chief negotiator of Iran during the discussions with United States officials in the Iran hostage crisis, where he has been described as a \\"radical\\" who gained influence at the expense of \\"moderates\\" as a result of the crisis.Brumberg, Daniel, Reinventing Khomeini, University of Chicago Press, (2001), p. 118 Nabavi served in different posts in the government of Iran, including a member of the Central Committee of the Islamic Revolution, the head of the Setad-e Basij-e Eghtesadi-e Keshvar (the body that introduced government-issued coupons because of economical difficulties of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War), which made the conservatives call him a couponist (which rhymes with communist in Persian), minister of heavy industries under Mir-Hossein Mousavi, and a representative of Tehran to the parliament (39% of ballots in 2000). He also worked in some state-owned petroleum companies, and acted as the chairman of the board in Petropars and a consultant to the CEO in Mapna, a company working on the expansion of oil refineries in Iran. As a member of the parliament, Nabavi has been one of the major critics of the Council of Guardians, the body which both vets candidates for political office and can veto legislation passed by parliament. In turn, the council banned him from running for re- election for parliamental in 2004 along with 80 other incumbents. On 1 February 2004, Nabavi resigned from parliament together with more than 100 MPs, and his resignation was accepted by a 154/22/7 (for/against/absentation) vote by the parliament on 18 April 2004. In his resignation speech, he mentioned the \\"violation of public rights\\" to be his main reason for resignation. Nabavi was also prohibited from running for office in other elections, and summoned by the judiciary for libel and \\"disturbing the public mind\\", when he was serving as an MP and hence certain restrictions applied for such summonings. Nabavi is among the people who started the notions of insider and outsider in the Islamic Republic, an idea that is mainly used by the conservatives. He still personally follows a division of insider and outsider, and does not sign the political declarations of his own party if it is co- signed by the Freedom Movement Party, a nationalist-religious party whose members have served as the first interim government of the Islamic Republic, but is now considered illegal by certain officials in the government, from both reformists and conservatives. Behzad Nabavi and Ali Akbar Mohtashami were among those who prevented by the Guardian council from taking part in the elections of Majlis. Arrest Nabavi was arrested after the 2009 Iran Presidential Election. He was sentenced to six years in prison by the court in February 2010.

It is also broadly used for other identification purposes where a unique production number is desirable; for example, automobile manufacturers use production numbers as part of the vehicle identification number. But since each studio can freely generate its own PC format, it cannot be used universally to identify the show and episode. While, in general, television episodes are filmed in the order they are intended to be aired in, there are circumstances in which this is not the case. In these instances, the production codes can be useful in determining the writers' original intentions. Some \\"stand-alone\\" shows, such as The Simpsons, Law & Order or SpongeBob SquarePants, may air episodes in radically different order to how they are produced, because character development and continuity are not major aspects of production. The airing order may in the end be decided by the network, based on ratings, sweeps months, or other networks' competition. Other, more serialized series, like Desperate Housewives, will air all of their episodes in order. In some rare cases, shows will film episodes out of order to accommodate guest stars' schedules, or to work around main stars' movie schedules. A good example of this is The X-Files, which filmed episodes out of order in its fifth and sixth seasons to accommodate the shooting schedules of main stars Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny. Code formats * General format for network and cable shows produced by NBC Universal, ABC Studios and CBS Studios is SYEE, where S is the variable-letter show identifier, Y is the season number and E is a two-digit episode number during that season. The code is only used on internal marketing material and feed slates. * 20th Television format for free-to-air network produced shows is YSSSEE, where Y is the season identifier from 1 to Z, S is the three-letter show identifier and E is a two-digit episode number during that season. Off- network produced shows after May 2011 is SSSYEE, previous codes were only numerical values in the form of S-Y-E. These are burned in on the end copyright slate; the letters I, O, Q, and U are not allowed to be used in the production code; however, The Simpsons will defeat this rule in late 2020 as its 32nd season predominantly uses the letter Q, because it has already cycled through every other digit. * Warner Bros. format for picked up weekly produced shows is SSSSEE, where S is the combined four-character alphanumeric show and season identifier and E is a two-digit episode number. Daily produced shows use YYYEEE, where Y is a three-digit yearly count and E is a three-digit episode count during that year. Pilots use a six-digit episode number. These are burned in on the end copyright slate. During 2016, the weekly produced and pilot formats were retired from the end slate for just the tape/reel location format of [TU]SS.SSSEE, where S is numeric only. * Paramount Pictures format for weekly produced shows is SSSSS-EEE, where S is a five-digit show number and E is a three-digit episode number. Daily produced shows use SE, where S is the variable-letter show identifier and E is a variable sequential-digit episode count.

IHS offers educational and career programs, holds seminars and on- campus programs for university students, awards scholarships, provides mentoring and research grants for aspiring professors, and sponsors a collection of online videos. Founded by F. A. \\"Baldy\\" Harper in 1961, Quote: \\"and he moved to transfer the bulk of the Volker funds to a new Institute for Humane Studies, which would expand the Volker concept and would provide a permanent home for libertarian fellowships, scholarship, conferences, and publications.\\" the organization later began an association with George Mason University and in 1985 moved to Fairfax, Virginia. The institute is currently located at 3434 Washington Blvd. on the Arlington campus of George Mason University. History The Institute for Humane Studies was founded in 1961 in Menlo Park, California by F. A. Harper in order to promote peace, prosperity, and social harmony by fostering a greater understanding of human affairs and freedom. Initially serving as the secretary and treasurer, Harper became the Institute's president in 1966, a position he held until his death in 1973.The Writings of F. A. Harper, Volume 1: The Major Works The Writings of F. A. Harper, Volume 1: The Major Works, 1978 Murray Rothbard played a key role as speaker at IHS conferences in the 1970s, promoting Austrian economics. On May 18, the 100th anniversary of the birth of Nobel Prize-winning economist Friedrich A. Hayek, who had been \\"instrumental in helping F.A. \\"Baldy\\" Harper found the Institute in 1961\\", IHS staff and friends gathered to honor Hayek. Following Harper in the role of president were Louis M. Spadaro and Leonard Liggio, who served as president from 1980 to 1989. From 1998 to 2000 Stanford graduate David C. Nott, now with the Reason Foundation, led the organization as president. The current president and CEO, Emily Chamlee-Wright, served as provost and dean at Washington College from 2012 to 2016 and was previously the Elbert H. Neese Professor of Economics and associate dean at Beloit College. Her predecessor, Marty Zupan, served as president and CEO from 2001 to 2016 after serving as editor of Reason magazine. After beginning an association with George Mason University, Liggio, Walter Grinder, and John Blundell moved the institute to Fairfax, Virginia in 1985. The organization is currently located on the George Mason University Arlington campus, along with sister organization the Mercatus Center. Organization and funding The institute's board of directors includes Charles G. Koch, Brian Hooks, Tyler Cowen, Art Pope, David Humphreys, Scott Beaulier, Christopher Coyne, Todd Zywicki, Kristina Kendall, Ryan Stowers, and Chris Rufer. IHS has received funding from a number of foundations, including the Sarah Scaife Foundation, the John Templeton Foundation, the F.M. Kirby Foundation, the Marcus Foundation, the John William Pope Foundation, the Ed Uihlein Family Foundation, the Ralph Smeed Private Memorial Foundation, the Koch Family Foundations, the Searle Freedom Trust, the E.L. Craig Foundation, and the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation. In March 2012, in the midst of a legal dispute between Charles Koch and the Cato Institute that caused renewed scrutiny of Koch's political philanthropy, IHS's chief financial officer told the New York Times that Koch is \\"a longtime and generous supporter of ours, but we're not involved as a political organization.\\" Charles Koch donated a total of $12.4 million to the organization from 2008 to 2012. The John William Pope Foundation has donated $2.1 million to the Institute since 1986. IHS fundraising appeals have been targeted to specific projects in the past. In 2011, Rand Paul signed a 10-page fundraising letter seeking gifts for the institute's Learn Liberty project, which IHS describes as a \\"resource for exploring the ideas of a free society.\\" Programs =Seminars= John Hasnas lecturing at Towson University. Each summer, IHS runs several free, weekend-long summer seminars for university students from around the world. Seminars are interdisciplinary and include lectures on history, economics, philosophy, law, and political science. Seminar themes include the value of property rights, limited government, peace, natural rights, free trade, individual autonomy, and free markets. There are introductory and advanced seminars. IHS also runs weekend on-campus seminars during the academic year. IHS and Liberty Fund co-sponsor the Advanced Topics in Liberty program, which is an invitation-only, discussion-based weekend conference series. For graduate students pursuing academic careers, IHS sponsors an annual research colloquium, policy research seminars and invitation-only Career Development Seminars designed to help students \\"land a job in academia, gain tenure, and contribute to the academic and intellectual conversation.\\" =Scholarships and grants= Each year IHS awards over $1 million in scholarships to students from universities around the world. Through its Humane Studies Fellowship program, IHS awards up to $15,000 in scholarships to graduate students embarking on \\"liberty-advancing careers in ideas.\\" Each summer, through the Summer Graduate Research Fellowship, IHS gives $5,000 stipends to young academics \\"to refine and complete a publishable scholarly article or thesis chapter that engages ideas within the classical liberal tradition.\\" The IHS PhD Scholarship awards $1,500 to \\"students dedicated to developing, teaching, and applying the principles of a free society.\\" Other various grants are awarded to graduate students and junior faculty to aid in their ability to present research or interview at academic or professional conferences. =Online projects= In 2010, IHS launched LearnLiberty.org, a website producing educational videos on libertarian ideas. The site's stated goals are \\"to provide a starting point for conversations on important questions: What is the nature of man and society? What are the best ways to organize human society? What is the proper role for government?\\" Notable guest lecturers featured on Learn Liberty include David Schmidtz of the University of Arizona and Jeffrey Miron of Harvard University. =Internships= Each summer, for more than 20 years, IHS hosted the Charles G. Koch Summer Fellow Program. The program is now hosted by the Charles Koch Institute. The program ran for 10 weeks, and included a paid public policy internship with two career and policy seminars. Fellows were placed at one partner think tanks and policy organizations across the United States. IHS also ran a year-round journalism internship program that placed aspiring journalists at media companies and non-profit newsrooms, but both the journalism and policy internship programs have been discontinued. In 2019, it was reported that John Elliott, who had directed IHS's journalism internship program from 2008 to 2013, had ties to the alt-right movement. IHS issued a statement which said \\"After careful review, we have uncovered no incident during his tenure at IHS in which Elliott exhibited anti-Semitic or bigoted views.\\" =Alum award= Each year, IHS awards an alumnus of its programs with the Charles G. Koch Outstanding IHS Alum Award. The award is given in recognition of \\"significant contributions to advancing liberty.\\" Past award winners include libertarian legal theorist and law professor Randy Barnett; Kris Mauren, co-founder of the Acton Institute; law professor Todd Zywicki; Kristina Kendall, executive producer for John Stossel; political science professor John Tomasi; Scott Bullock, senior attorney at the Institute for Justice; economist Peter Boettke; John Hood, president of the John Locke Foundation; and David Schmidtz, a professor of philosophy and economics.

It has litigated eight cases considered by the United States Supreme Court dealing with topics that included eminent domain, interstate commerce, public financing for elections, school vouchers, tax credits for private school tuition, civil asset forfeiture, and residency requirements for liquor license. The organization was founded in 1991. As of June 2016, it employed a staff of 95 (including 39 attorneys) in Arlington, Virginia and seven offices across the United States. Its 2016 budget was $20 million.  History  William H. \\"Chip\\" Mellor and Clint Bolick co-founded the organization in 1991 with seed money from libertarian philanthropist Charles Koch. Mellor was the organization's President & General Counsel through 2015. Bolick was the Vice President and Director of Litigation from 1991 until he left the organization in 2004. In March 2015, the organization announced that Mellor will become the chairman of its board of directors in January 2016. Senior Attorney Scott Bullock replaced Mellor as President. The organization's methods were modeled in part on work Bolick had done as the director of the Landmark Center for Civil Rights in Washington, D.C. For example, in the late 1980s Bolick represented Washington shoeshine stand owner Ego Brown in his attempt to overturn a Jim Crow-era law against bootblack stands on public streets. The law was designed to restrict economic opportunities for African-Americans, but was still being enforced 85 years after its passage. Bolick sued the District of Columbia on Brown's behalf, and the law was overturned in 1989. In 1991, Bolick joined former Department of Energy Deputy General Counsel Chip Mellor to found the Institute for Justice. Mellor had served as president of the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, a think tank in San Francisco. According to the Institute for Justice, books commissioned and published by the Pacific Research Institute \\"formed the Institute for Justice's long-term, strategic litigation blueprint\\". As of 2012, the organization employed a staff of 65 (including 33 attorneys) in Arlington, Virginia and five regional offices across the United States. = Supreme Court cases = The organization has litigated eight cases that reached the Supreme Court, winning seven (the exception being Kelo v. City of New London): * Zelman v. Simmons-Harris (2002) The court ruled in favor of a Cleveland, Ohio school voucher program, allowing the use of public money to pay tuition at private and parochial schools. * Swedenburg v. Kelly (2005) The court struck down laws in New York and Michigan that made it illegal for consumers to buy wine directly from out-of-state wineries. The institute represented small vintners in Virginia and California. (This case was consolidated with Granholm v. Heald prior to consideration by the Supreme Court.) * Kelo v. City of New London (2005) The court ruled that the state of Connecticut could use eminent domain to take property from the plaintiffs (a group of homeowners) and transfer it to a private business. The institute represented the home owners. * Garriott v. Winn (2010) The court upheld an Arizona program that gave tax credits for private school tuition. This case was consolidated with Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization v. Winn prior to consideration by the Supreme Court. * Arizona Free Enterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett (2011) The court struck down part of a public campaign financing law in Arizona that provided additional public funding to candidates based on the amount of spending by their opponents. The institute represented several challengers to the law. This case was consolidated with McComish v. Bennett prior to consideration by the Supreme Court. *Timbs v. Indiana (2019) The court ruled that the Eighth Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause is an incorporated protection applicable to the States under the Fourteenth Amendment‚Äôs Due Process Clause, thus grossly disproportionate asset forfeiture is unconstitutional. *Tennessee Wine and Spirits Retailers Association v. Thomas (2019) The court ruled the residency requirement for retail liquor licenses violates the Commerce Clause and the 21st Amendment does not save it. *Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue (2019) The court ruled that excluding religious schools from a tax-funded scholarship program available to non-religious private schools violates the Free Exercise Clause under a strict scrutiny analysis.Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue, _ U.S. _ (2020)  Activities  = Litigation = The organization provides pro bono legal advice and representation to clients. According to the organization, it selects cases based on the client's ability to pay (giving preference to clients who do not have the means to obtain other representation), and on the case's potential to publicize and educate the public on the issues involved.  Commercial regulation  IJ opposes many kinds of business licensing. The organization's first case began in 1991, defending Taalib-Din Uqdah, a Washington, DC businessman who owned a salon to braid hair. Local authorities informed Taalib-Din that he would need a cosmetology license in order to continue operating his business. The institute contended that the licensing requirements did not apply to Taalib-Din's business. Further, the organization claimed that the licensing rules in this case were designed to protect existing businesses from competition, with the effect of reducing choice and raising prices for consumers. The case was dismissed in 1992, but later in that year the city council repealed the cosmetology regulations that prevented Taalib-Din from opening his business. While institute co-founders Clint Bolick and Chip Mellor have acknowledged the need for health, safety, and consumer protection regulations, the organization continues to litigate against what it sees as abuse. It has defended a variety of small business owners across the United States in similar cases involving food cart and street vendors, vendors and makers of caskets, florists, interior designers, and independent taxi drivers. In defending tour guide operators in Philadelphia and Washington D.C., the Institute for Justice argued that restrictions on these businesses abridged First Amendment rights., In 2005, the organization litigated on behalf of small wineries in California and Virginia. The institute's case, Swedenburg v. Kelly, was consolidated with Granholm v. Heald and considered by the Supreme Court. The court ruled that laws in Michigan and New York that prohibited consumers from buying wine directly from out-of-state wineries were unconstitutional. In 2009, the organization sued to allow donors to be compensated for giving bone marrow. The National Organ Transplant Act of 1984 (NOTA) made it illegal to compensate organ donors, but did not prevent payment for other forms of donations (such as human plasma, sperm, and egg cells). Although bone marrow is not an organ or a component of an organ, the act made paying bone marrow donors punishable by up to 5 years in prison. At the time the act was passed, donating bone marrow involved a painful and risky medical procedure. In the years after the act was passed, a new procedure (apheresis) made it possible to harvest bone marrow cells through a non-surgical procedure similar to the donation of blood components such as platelets or plasma. The Institute for Justice lawsuit argued that the development of apheresis meant that donors who gave bone marrow through blood donation should be allowed to receive compensation. The organization predicted that allowing compensation would increase the pool of available donors, and claimed that 3,000 Americans die each year while waiting for compatible marrow donors. Critics argued that allowing compensation could reduce donation, increase the risk of disease, and lead to exploitation of the poor. In December 2011, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled unanimously that donors giving bone marrow via apheresis were eligible for compensation. In November 2013, the federal government proposed a regulation that would change legal definitions to cover bone marrow regardless of how it is obtained. This would have the effect of keeping the ban on compensating donors in place. As of July 2014, the proposal was still under review.  Eminent domain and civil forfeiture  One of the few remaining houses in the Fort Trumbull neighborhood, September 1, 2006. Underneath the white paint can just barely be read the words \\"\\" and the web URLs of two organizations protesting over-use of eminent domain, the Castle Coalition and the Institute for Justice. Eminent domain cases pursued by the organization involve instances where a government seeks to condemn a property and transfer it from one private owner to another (as opposed to using it for a road, building, park, or other publicly owned property). The organization gained national attention in 1996, defending a small business owner in a case involving Trump Casino (Casino Reinvestment Development Authority v. Coking), and again in 2005, arguing Kelo v. City of New London before the Supreme Court. In the casino case, a New Jersey state agency (the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority) was attempting to condemn Vera Coking's boarding house, along with two other businesses in Atlantic City, in order to transfer the properties to a business owned by Donald Trump. In 1998, a New Jersey Superior Court judge ruled that the state was not allowed to seize the properties. However, the ruling did not contest the state's right to take property from one private owner for the purpose of giving it to another. The judge based the ruling on the fact that the state did not get a guarantee that the Trump organization would use the property for a new parking area (as promised), instead of using the property for other purposes such as expanding Trump's casino. According to the Institute for Justice, the organization received a \\"deluge\\" of requests to participate in other cases of eminent domain abuse after its win in the Coking case. In 2008, organization president Chip Mellor stated: > Frankly, we had not realized just how widespread this phenomenon was until > [the Coking case] ... Once we became aware of it, though, we formed a > strategic plan to escalate it to national attention and ultimately to the > Supreme Court, which we did in the course of the next seven years. In 2005, the organization represented the plaintiffs in the Supreme Court case Kelo v. City of New London. In this case, the state of Connecticut was attempting to take properties owned by state residents and give them to a private company for use in a development. In a 5-to-4 decision the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the state, affirming the right of states to transfer properties from one private owner to another in this way. The ruling prompted what was widely called a \\"backlash\\" against this kind of eminent domain activity. In 2006 (on the first anniversary of the Kelo ruling), President George W. Bush issued an executive order limiting how federal agencies could use eminent domain. Between the Kelo ruling and June 2008, 37 states passed laws to increase restrictions on the use of eminent domain. In 2006, the organization won an eminent domain case in the Ohio Supreme Court, the first eminent domain decision by a state supreme court after Kelo. In the years since, the institute has continued its efforts to reform eminent domain laws. The organization also works to publicize what it sees as abuse of civil forfeiture laws. Civil forfeiture is the process by which law enforcement agencies in the United States can take property from citizens, based on the suspicion that the property was used in a crime of some kind, without a criminal charge or conviction. Depending on the state law, law enforcement agencies can keep some or all of the confiscated money and property, and apply it to their budgets. State agencies can also confiscate property under federal statutes, and through a program called \\"equitable sharing\\" keep up to 80% of the property. The Institute for Justice and other critics argue that this direct financial reward gives law enforcement agencies a strong incentive to abuse civil asset forfeiture. In these cases, the organization occasionally works with other advocacy groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), The Heritage Foundation, and the American Bankers Association.  Campaign finance  In 2011, the organization challenged an Arizona law in the United States Supreme Court (Arizona Free Enterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett). The law provided increased public campaign funding based on the amount spent by a candidate's opponent. The institute argued that the law violated the First Amendment rights of independent groups and candidates who do not accept public financing. In a 5-4 ruling, the court struck down the part of the law that provided escalating matching funds. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that the law forced independent groups to face a choice: \\"trigger matching funds, change your message, or do not speak.\\" Other Institute for Justice cases involve regulations on political activity related to elections.  Education  The organization has litigated several cases related to education reform and school vouchers, including three successful cases that went to the Supreme Court: Zelman v. Simmons-Harris (2002), Garriott v. Winn (2010), and Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue (2020).Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue, _ U.S. _ (2020) In the Zelman case, the Supreme Court ruled that parents can use public money (in the form of school vouchers) to pay tuition at private schools, including parochial schools. The institute represented parents in that case. In the Garriott case, the court dismissed a challenge to a program in Arizona that gave state tax credits for payment of private school tuition. The institute argued in favor of dismissal. In the Espinoza case, the court ruled that Montana could not exclude religious schools from state scholarship program funded by tax credits available to non-religious private school.Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue,  U.S.  (2020) = Activism and coalitions = The institute maintains training programs, activism networks, and partnerships with other organizations. The IJ Clinic on Entrepreneurship is a joint project of the Institute for Justice and The University of Chicago Law School. The clinic provides free legal services for startups and other entrepreneurs in economically disadvantaged communities in the Chicago area. The organization provides educational opportunities for law students, such as a yearly conference for law students at George Washington University. According to the Institute for Justice, participants in the conference, along with the organization's former law clerks and interns, can join the institute's \\"Human Action Network\\". The institute offers to match network members with volunteer and pro-bono opportunities in their local communities. The organization also recruits volunteers for its \\"Liberty in Action\\" project, for support activism by non-lawyers. The institute founded the Castle Coalition in 2002 to provide more specific tools for activists in the area of eminent domain abuse.  Finances  IJ operates as a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit. Charity Navigator has given the institute a four-star rating (out of four) for financial transparency and efficiency in each year since it began evaluating charities in 2001. According to the institute, 85 percent of contributions in 2012 came from individuals, with 14 percent coming from foundations and 1 percent coming from businesses. As of 2005, IJ did not actively solicit corporate donations. According to information provided to the Internal Revenue Service, the organization spent about $12.8 million in the fiscal year ending June 2013. In that year, 83.2% of money spent went to the programs and services the institute delivers, with the rest going to administrative expenses (9.4%) and fund raising expenses (7.2%).

A professor of classics at the University of Zurich, Switzerland, he taught in the UK and the US. He has influenced generations of students of religion since the 1960s, combining in the modern way the findings of archaeology and epigraphy with the work of poets, historians, and philosophers. He published books on the balance between lore and science among the followers of Pythagoras, and more extensively on ritual and archaic cult survival, on the ritual killing at the heart of religion, on mystery religions, and on the reception in the Hellenic world of Near Eastern and Persian culture, which sets Greek religion in its wider Aegean and Near Eastern context.  First academic era  Burkert was born in Neuendettelsau. He married Maria Bosch in 1957 and they had three children, Reinhard, Andrea and Cornelius. He studied classical philology, history, and philosophy at the Universities of Erlangen and Munich (1950‚Äì1954), and obtained his doctorate in philosophy at Erlangen in 1955. Following his marriage, he became an Assistant in course teaching at Erlangen for five years (1957‚Äì1961) and, then returned to his former University as Lecturer for another five years (until 1966). From early 1965 he worked as a Junior Fellow in the Center for Hellenic Studies in Washington, D.C. for one year. The first academic era of his life ended with a placement as Professor of Classical Philology at the Technical University of Berlin (1966‚Äì1969), and as Guest Professor at Harvard University for a year (1968). Second academic era The start of a new era began in 1981 when his work of ancient Greek religious anthropology, Homo Necans (1972), was published in an Italian translation, followed in 1983 by an English translation. The book is today considered an outstanding account of concepts in Greek religion. He was Professor of Classical Philology at the University of Zurich (1969‚Äì1996); Visiting Professor of Classical Literature at the University of California for two years (1977 and 1988); Lecturer at Harvard in 1982; Dean of the Philosophical Faculty I at Zurich (1986‚Äì1988); and presented the Gifford Lectures at the University of St Andrews in Scotland (1989). After holding these posts and receiving numerous honorary awards (including Balzan Prize in 1990, for Study of the Ancient World), he retired as an Emeritus in 1996. He died in Zurich, aged 84. Academic works Three of his most important academic works (a selection from seventeen books and two hundred essays, including encyclopedia contributions and memorabilia), which are still at the base of the study of Hellenic religion, are Homo Necans (1972, English 1983), Greek Religion (1977, English 1985), and Ancient Mystery Cults (1982 lectures, published 1987). In his preface to the English translation of Homo Necans Burkert, who characterised himself on this occasion as \\"a philologist who starts from ancient Greek texts and attempts to find biological, psychological and sociological explanations for religious phenomena\\",Introduction, p. xix. Burkert's stress is actually sociological and scarcely biological. expressed some of the principles underlying a book that had seemed somewhat revolutionary to German readers in 1972 in its consistent application of inter-relationships of myth and ritual, the application to texts of the kind of functionalism espoused in Jane Ellen Harrison's ThemisHarrison's Themis is specifically instanced, p. xiii. and the use of structuralism to elucidate an ethology of Greek religion, its social aspect. Burkert confirmed that an impetus for his book had come from Konrad Lorenz, On Aggression, \\"which seemed to offer new insight into the disquieting manifestations of violence.\\" The book argues that solidarity was achieved among the Greeks through a sacred crime with due reparations: \\"for the strange prominence of animal slaughter in ancient religion this still seems to be the most economical, and most humane explanation\\" (p. xv). Its first chapter \\"Sacrifice as an Act of Killing\\" offers conclusions that are supported in the ensuing chapters through individual inquiries into myth, festival and ritual, in which the role of poetic creation and re-creation are set aside \\"in order to confront the power and effect of tradition as fully as possible\\". The term gods, Burkert concludes, remains fluid, whereas sacrifice is a fact (p. xv). Burkert's theory of sacrificial ritual In 1985, Burkert used ancient sources (both literary and visual representations) to put together some of the pieces of how ancient Greek sacrificial ritual actually proceeded, and to link together the ritual with myth. Firstly, under the direction of the priest, priestess, father, mother (at least, in certain women's rites like Thesmophoria), or king, a basket containing the utensils and a bowl of water were placed around the altar. The participants then dipped their hands into the consecrated water, and sprinkled it on the altar, victim and offerer. Salted-barley corns from the basket were thrown on the animal's head and into the altar fire. A lock of hair from the animal is then cut and burned, libation being poured on the altar with prayer. After silence is proclaimed, the music of flutes begins and the animal is slain. The larger animals were killed with a sacrificial axe. The head is turned toward the heavens, and the throat cut. The blood then spreads on the altar and is caught in a vessel. In early literary sources such as the Homeric epics the Iliad and Odyssey, onlooking women raise a cry of worship (ololugma) at this point in the ritual. After the animal is skinned and cut into pieces, the inner parts are tasted and shared, and a part burned on the altar with incense. The remainder is roasted and eaten by all participants present. If the entrails are of normal shape and color, it is an omen that the sacrifice is acceptable to the gods. In both the Iliad and Odyssey, as well as other early sources such as the Homeric Hymn to Hermes, the priest or sacrifice-leader wrapped the thigh pieces in fat and burned them on the altar. The tail and back, along with other bones and pieces with less meat left over were burned with a libation. After this procedure, it was then that the worshippers shared the roasted meal, while music and dance took place in the service of the gods. At some special festivals, there are instances where everyone in the banquet consumes hundreds of animal sacrifices. Works * Weisheit und Wissenschaft: Studien zu Pythagoras, Philolaos und Platon.

Previously, he served as Vice President of Litigation at the conservative/libertarian Goldwater Institute. He co-founded the libertarian Institute for Justice, where he was the Vice President and Director of Litigation from 1991 until 2004. He led two cases that went before the Supreme Court of the United States. He has also defended state-based school choice programs in the Supreme Courts of Wisconsin and Ohio. Early life and education Bolick was born on December 26, 1957 in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Bolick grew up in nearby Hillside and graduated from Hillside High School in 1975.Bolick, Clint. \\"Remedial Education (Clint Bolick)\\", Center for Education Reform. Accessed July 5, 2017. \\"I grew up in Hillside, a suburb of Newark, in a single-parent, working-class family. In 1975, Hillside High School graduated me with enough skills to secure a scholarship at an excellent college and go on to a successful career in law and public policy.\\" He graduated from Drew University in 1979 and received his J.D. from the University of California Davis School of Law in 1982. As a law student, he supported laws and legal rulings that knocked down racial discrimination (calling Brown v. Board of Education a \\"triumph of the principle of equality\\"), and was a vocal opponent of race-based preferences and reverse discrimination. In 1980, he ran as a Libertarian for a seat in the California State Assembly. He lost to an incumbent Democrat but garnered 7.1 percent of the vote. (In that election, the Libertarian presidential ticket earned about 1% of the vote nationwide.) Career =Mountain States Legal Foundation= In 1982, he joined a public interest law firm, the Mountain States Legal Foundation in Denver, Colorado. He was hired by the foundation's acting president, William H. \\"Chip\\" Mellor. In 1984, Mellor left the organization over a conflict with one of the foundation's sponsors. Bolick also left, believing that the foundation was more interested in protecting business interests than in promoting economic freedom. In 2005, he said, > Chip and I discovered that there is a world of difference between an > organization that is pro-business and an organization that is pro-free > enterprise. After their break with Mountain States, they began planning a free-enterprise public interest law firm that would follow a philosophy of \\"economic liberty.\\" These plans would lead to the founding of the Institute for Justice in 1991. =Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Justice Department= Bolick joined the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in 1985. While he only stayed at the EEOC for a year, he became friends with its chairman, future Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. (Thomas is the godfather to Bolick's second son.) Thomas helped convince him that removing economic barriers for the poor was more important than fighting race-based \\"reverse discrimination.\\" His conversations with Thomas bolstered Bolick's belief that racism was a formidable barrier to blacks and other people of color. In 1991, he would support adding punitive damages to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He explained, \\"It seemed to me that if you didn't want quotas, you had to have tough remedies and punitive damages against recalcitrant discriminators ... That very much came out of Thomas.\\" Thomas also shaped his preferred remedy for inequality: removing unnecessary (and often racist) laws and regulations that prevented the poor from starting small businesses. Thomas did this in part by telling Bolick about his grandfather, who began with a hand-built pushcart and built a profitable delivery service that comfortably supported his family, only to encounter threats from regulations designed to destroy black-owned businesses. Bolick left the EEOC to join the Justice Department in 1986. In 1988, he wrote his first book, Changing Course. In this book, he defined \\"civil rights\\" in part from the perspective of removing economic and regulatory barriers for the poor and disadvantaged. =Landmark Center for Civil Rights= In 1989, he left the Justice Department and, with a grant from the Landmark Legal Foundation, started a public advocacy law practice in Washington DC. In its first case, the Landmark Center for Civil Rights represented Washington shoeshine stand owner Ego Brown in his attempt to overturn a Jim Crow-era law against bootblack stands on public streets. The law was designed to restrict economic opportunities for African-Americans, but was still being enforced 85 years after its passage. He sued the District of Columbia on Brown's behalf, and the law was overturned in 1989. While working for the Landmark Legal Foundation, he defended the first Wisconsin school voucher program in court. He openly supported Clarence Thomas during his confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court. On July 31, 1991, about 45 people from Thomas's home town of Pin Point, Georgia visited Washington to show support for the nominee. At the time, Bolick told The Washington Post that the Landmark Center for Civil Rights raised $3,000 to pay for bus rental and contributed another $1,100 for hotel charges. =Institute for Justice= In 1991, Bolick and Chip Mellor (his former boss from the Mountain States Legal Foundation) co-founded the Institute for Justice with funding from Charles Koch. He was the Vice President and Director of Litigation from 1991 until 2004. The organization litigates on behalf of small businesses faced with regulations that it views as unjustified or anti-competitive. It also promotes school choice, property rights, and free speech. Bolick and the institute were active in defending a Cleveland, Ohio school voucher program, which was declared constitutional in a 2002 Supreme Court case, Zelman v. Simmons-Harris The court ruled in favor of a Cincinnati, Ohio school voucher program, allowing the use of public money to pay tuition at private and parochial schools. He led the case Swedenburg v. Kelly while at the institute. This case was consolidated with Granholm v. Heald and considered by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2005. Bolick argued the case before the court, along with attorney Kathleen Sullivan. The court struck down regulatory barriers to direct interstate shipment of wine to consumers.Granholm v. Heald, 544 U.S. 460 (2005), Oyez In April 1993, he wrote an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal opposing two appointments by the Clinton administration (Lani Guinier to assistant attorney general for civil rights and Norma V. Cantu to assistant secretary for civil rights in the Department of Education). The Journal ran the piece under the headline \\"Clinton's Quota Queens.\\" After the piece was published, he distributed information about Guinier's writings and interpreted them for reporters. He also appeared on the television news shows Nightline and Crossfire to oppose her appointment. The article and Bolick's subsequent efforts were credited with helping end Guinier's appointment. On June 3, 1993, President Clinton withdrew her nomination. Clinton stated that he had not read Guinier's writings at the time of her nomination, and called some of her writings \\"anti-democratic.\\" Clinton went on to describe the effort to stop Guinier's appointment as \\"a campaign of right-wing distortion and vilification,\\" and according to press reports referred to Bolick's editorial with \\"particular scorn.\\" Other critics accused Bolick and conservatives who opposed Guinier of racism and sexism, often citing the phrase \\"quota queen\\" as evidence. =Alliance for School Choice= In 2004, he joined the Alliance for School Choice, a national non-profit educational policy group advocating school choice programs across the United States. He was that organization's first President and General Counsel. =Goldwater Institute= Bolick speaking at the 2014 Goldwater Dinner in Scottsdale, Arizona In 2007, he became the Vice President for Litigation at the Goldwater Institute when that organization added a litigation group. In 2009, Bolick became a sharp critic of nationally well-known Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, who has worked to stem the flow of illegal immigrants in the Southwest. Bolick claimed that Arpaio's \\"effectiveness has been compromised for the past several years by misplaced priorities.\\" Bolick helped to draft model legislation known as the 'Health Care Freedom Act' that seeks to preserve the right of individuals to pay for health care directly instead of being compelled to enroll in a government-sponsored insurance plan. Arizona and Oklahoma voters approved a version of the Health Care Freedom Act in their respective November 2010 general elections.} Also in November 2010, voters in Arizona, South Carolina, South Dakota and Utah adopted a measure he drafted called Save Our Secret Ballot, which guarantees workers the right to a secret-ballot vote in union- organizing elections. On July 30, 2015, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump called for the deportation of all of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States.

Matica Srpska was founded in 1826, in Pest (today a part of Budapest), and moved to Novi Sad in 1864. It is the oldest matica in the world. History Building of Matica srpska. Of all the Slavic maticas, Matica Srpska was the first to be established in the Habsburg Empire on the ancestral territory of the Rascians (better known as Rascia) at the time of a Serb national and cultural awakening, while under Habsburg and Ottoman thraldom.Srbi u Vojvodini, –¢–æ–º 2 by Du≈°an J. Popoviƒá, Matica srpska, 1990, pg. 3 Matica Srpska Charter During the national awakening in the 19th century, the Serbs of the Serbian Vojvodina played an instrumental role as, by force of historical circumstance, they formed at this period the core of Serb intellectual life. One of the most important tasks facing the Serbs, in advancing cultural- national rebirth, was the solution of the literary language problem, and, as a result of the first fifty years of the 19th century, saw the Vojvodina Serbs engaged in an intense debate about the kind of literary language that their newly revitalized, emerging nation should adopt. For the Slavic people, as well as the non-Slavs, under the Habsburg Empire, the Matica foundation fomented the development of national cultures. Indeed, the oldest is Matica srpska founded in 1826 in Pest by Jovan Had≈æiƒá and his business backers, Josif Milovuk (1793‚Äì1850), Jovan Demetroviƒá (1778‚Äì1830), Gavrilo Bozitovac (1789‚Äì1856), Andrija Rozmiroviƒá, Petar Rajiƒá, and Djordje Stankoviƒá (1782‚Äì1853) at the same time as the Hungarian Academy was being built. Jovan Had≈æiƒá prepared its by-laws, secured its charter, and also served as its first president while Josif Milovuk served as its first secretary. In addition to books, it published the journal Serbski letopis, founded two years earlier by Georgije Magara≈°eviƒá, Pavel Jozef ≈†af√°rik, and Lukijan Mu≈°icki in Novi Sad, where Magara≈°eviƒá was professor and ≈†af√°rik the director of Novi Sad's Serbian Gymnasium. The story of the Matica srpska actually began in 1824, when the Austrian authorities permitted writer Georgije Magara≈°eviƒá, a professor at a gymnasium in the town of Novi Sad, to publish a literary and scholarly journal entitled \\"Serbski letopis\\" (\\"Serbian Annals\\"). Magara≈°eviƒá had little financial backing but soon found benefactors who supported his efforts. In time, the writers and editors of the publication developed into a learned society, successfully overcoming pressures applied by mistrustful Austrian officials as well as later financial difficulties. With varying degrees of success but with great perseverance, it has continued to support and guide Serb intellectual endeavor, first as a part of the Habsburg Empire and much later in Serbia. In 1838, a wealthy Serb landowner, Sava Tekelija, left the Matica a legacy to support Serbian students at the University of Pest and a college named after him, Tekelijanum (Tokolyanum in Hungarian). The Hungarian authorities were suspicious of the Matica and even suspended its activities in 1835‚Äì1836 for alleged pan-Slavism, but they resisted Serb efforts to move the institution to Novi Sad. In 1863 the move was nevertheless accomplished, and the Matica, as well as the journal Letopis, is flourishing there today. The Matica Srpska Society was one of the initiators of the Novi Sad agreement on the Serbo-Croatian language (1954), and it led the action for making the unique orthography of the language (1960). They compiled The Vocabulary of Serbian Standard Literary Language in six volumes (1967‚Äì76).http://www.dml.rs/index.php/lat/tekstovi-lat/leksikografija- lat/79-recnici-savremenog-srpskog-jezika-lat In Yugoslavia, Matica srpska was one half of a joint project (with Matica hrvatska) to develop a common Serbo- Croatian dictionary. Mid-way through the project (1967), Matica hrvatska, in accordance with the declaration of principles about the Croatian language, withdrew, and Matica srpska was left to finish the dictionary on her own. Matica Srpska has been an example to many Slavic nations. Based on this model the following institutions were established: Czech Matica in 1831, Illyrian Matica in 1842 (in 1874 renamed to Matica hrvatska); Matica Lu≈æiƒçkosrpska in 1847, Halych-Russian Matica in Lviv in 1848; Moravian Matica in 1849; Matica Dalmatinska in Zadar in 1861; Slovak Matica in 1863; Slovenian Matica in 1864; Matica Opava in 1877; Matica in the Teschen Princedom in 1898. (from which Silesian Matica came to be in 1968); Polish Matica in Lvov (1882); Educational Matica in the Teschen Princedom in 1885; Educational Matica in Warsaw in 1905; Bulgarian Matica in Constantinople in 1909 and the new Bulgarian Matica in 1989. Activities and library Matica Srpska publishes the Letopis Matice srpske magazine, which is one of the oldest in the world, being continuously published since 1824. The institution has already published numerous books by authors such as Jovan Sterija Popoviƒá since its inception.Publication of 1828 on the Website of the Library, retrieved on 2017-10-28.

They released two full-length albums‚ÄîFrigid Stars LP in 1990 and The White Birch in 1994. The band broke up in 1994 shortly after the release of The White Birch, but reunited to play a handful of shows in 2012. Due to the band's slow and depressing musical style, they are credited as a pioneering act of what is known as \\"slowcore\\" or \\"sadcore\\". History Codeine was formed by members Stephen Immerwahr (vocal, bass), Chris Brokaw (drums), and John Engle (guitar).Strong, Martin C. (2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, , p. 679-680 Codeine pioneered the slowcore and sadcore subgenres of indie rock,Mason, Stewart \\"Codeine Biography\\", AllMusic, Retrieved 26 June 2011 Retrieved 21 July 2012 but with a more experimental attitude than other bands in the genre, such as Low, Idaho and Red House Painters. The band's original tone, marked by slow tempos, Immerwahr's nasal vocals, and Engle's ringing Telecaster, stayed consistent during their career. Codeine released their first album Frigid Stars LP on the German label Glitterhouse in August 1990. The album was released on Sub Pop early the following year. The Barely Real EP was released in November 1992. Immerwahr rejected several of the songs after the recording session. Some of these songs would be re-recorded for the final album. The song \\"W.\\" is a solo performance on piano by David Grubbs (of Bastro, Squirrel Bait and Gastr del Sol). A somewhat different full-band version of the song appears on Codeine's next album, now titled \\"Wird\\". Brokaw left the band after the release of Barely Real to play full-time with his other band Come, and after Josh Madell of Antietam replaced him temporarily for a US tour, he was replaced permanently by Rex drummer Doug Scharin. Codeine's final release was the full-length album The White Birch, released in May 1994. David Grubbs also participated on the album. After this release, the band broke up. Doug Scharin continued in Rex and June of 44, and later as the band leader of HiM. Following the demise of Come, original drummer Chris Brokaw became a solo artist and itinerant musician, including playing drums for The New Year and playing guitar with Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth and with Christina Rosenvinge. Reunion In February 2012, Codeine announced it would perform on the request of Mogwai at All Tomorrow's Parties' sister event, I'll Be Your Mirror, on 26 May 2012 in London, United Kingdom at Alexandra Palace, along with other shows, to commemorate a comprehensive reissue of their recordings by The Numero Group in June 2012. Codeine's final reunion show was at Le Poisson Rouge in New York on 15 July 2012.

He was a joint founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh,http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf and was the posthumous founder of Anderson's College (later Anderson's Institution), which ultimately evolved into the University of Strathclyde. Early life and career Anderson was born at the manse at Rosneath, Dunbartonshire, the son of Margaret Turner (d. 1784) and Rev James Anderson\\"Anderson, John\\" in Chambers's Encyclop√¶dia. London: George Newnes, 1961, Vol. 1, p. 409. His father and grandfather were prominent ministers of the church. After his father's death he was raised by his aunt in Stirling, where he attended grammar school. He graduated with an MA from the University of Glasgow in 1745. During the Jacobite Rising of 1745 he served as an officer in the Hanoverian army. From 1755-57 he was Professor of Oriental Languages in the University of Glasgow, and from 1757 to 1796 Professor of Natural Philosophy. He is the longest-serving natural philosophy lecturer during the 18th century. A leading scientist In 1760, Anderson was appointed to the more congenial post of professor of natural philosophy at the University of Glasgow. He began to concentrate on physics. He had a love of experiments, practical mechanics and inventions. He encouraged James Watt in his development of steam power. He was acquainted with Benjamin Franklin, and in 1772 he installed the first lightning conductor in Glasgow. Anderson also wrote the pioneering textbook Institutes of Physics published in 1786, which went through five editions in ten years. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and this brought him into contact with many of the leading scientists of the day. A pioneer of vocational education for working people His greatest love though was in providing \\"useful learning\\" to the working class, especially in the application of science to industry. He did this alongside his University duties, by providing non-academic lectures for artisans during the evenings. In these popular lectures he concentrated on experiments and demonstrations, and from his predilection for setting off explosions and fireworks, he acquired the nickname \\"Jolly Jack Phosphorus\\". Radical politics Anderson was also known for his radical political views and was a supporter of the French Revolution. In 1791 he invented a new type of six- pound gun, which was presented to the National Convention in Paris as \\"the gift of Science to Liberty\\". While in France, neighbouring Germany, fearing the spread of radical politics to its territory, imposed a blockade on French newspapers. Anderson suggested sending pamphlets on the wind to Germany attached to small hydrogen balloons, and this was done, with each balloon bearing an inscription translated as \\"O‚Äôer hills and dales, and lines of hostile troops, I float majestic, bearing the laws of God and Nature to oppressed men, and bidding them with arms their rights maintain.\\" Founder of a university Building on the lectures for artisans, he bequeathed his property for the foundation of a school in Glasgow devoted to \\"useful learning\\", called Anderson's Institution or Andersonian University. As an example of its success it enabled a young millworker, David Livingstone, to become a famous missionary doctor and the foremost explorer of his day. The Institution underwent various name-changes and a number of mergers with other colleges before arriving at its current form as the University of Strathclyde, which honours Anderson in the name of the physics building and the main library, the Andersonian Library. The city centre campus is named the John Anderson Campus. John Anderson died in Glasgow at the age of 69. He is buried with his grandfather in Ramshorn Cemetery on Ingram Street in Glasgow. On 13 January 1996 representatives from the University of Glasgow laid a wreath to mark the bicentennial of Anderson's death.

The 125th anniversary of the edict was depicted on a former Turkish postcard stamp.http://cfile227.uf.daum.net/image/1716B10C49BBD10B14279F The proclamation was issued at the behest of reformist Grand Vizier Mustafa Re≈üid Pasha. It promised reforms such as the abolition of tax farming, reform of conscription, and guarantee of rights to all Ottoman citizens regardless of religion or ethnic group. The goal of the decree was to help modernize the empire militarily and socially so that it could compete with the Great Powers of Europe. It also was hoped the reforms would win over the disaffected parts of the empire, especially in the Ottoman controlled parts of Europe, which were largely Christian. At the time of the edict, millets had gained a large amount of religious autonomy within the empire, threatening the central government. This edict, along with the subsequent Imperial Reform Edict of 1856, was therefore an early step towards the empire's goal of Ottomanism, or a unified national and legal Ottoman identity.William L. Cleveland, A History of the Modern Middle East (Boulder: Westview Press, 2013), 77. It was published in the Tekvim-i Vekayi in Ottoman Turkish. In addition, it was published in Greek and French, the latter in Moniteur ottoman, (info page on book at Martin Luther University) - Cited: p. 22 (PDF p. 24) and Fran√ßois Alphonse Belin, a dragoman, created his own French version, published in the Journal Asiatique. (info page on book at Martin Luther University) - Cited: p. 23 (PDF p. 25) The Edict of G√ºlhane did not enact any official legal changes but merely made royal promises to the empire's subjects, and they were never fully implemented due to Christian nationalism and resentment among Muslim populations in these areas.Cleveland 76‚Äì77. At the end of the Crimean War, the Western powers pressured Turkey to undertake further reforms, mainly to deprive the Russians, with whom peace negotiations were then under way, of any further pretense for intervention in the internal affairs of the Ottoman Empire. The result of these pressures was the proclamation of the Hatt-ƒ± H√ºm√¢y√ªnu (Imperial Rescript) of 18 February 1856.Herbert J. Liebesny The law of the Near and Middle East readings, cases, and materials, Albany: State University of New York Press Contents While the Edict of G√ºlhane was more complex, it consisted mainly of three demands. The first was a guaranteed insurance of the security of life of every subject. The direction of thought here being that if a subject's life is endangered, he/she can become a danger to others and the sultan, since people do many things out of fear in order to protect their health. If there is an absence of security to fortune, everyone is insensible to the government and public good. The second proposed a regular system of assessing and levying taxes, troops, and duration of service. Subjects would be taxed a quota determined by their means and a reduced military term would lessen the blow that occurred to industries when the men were away. This collection of demands can be summed up under the title of governmental impositions on subjects. This new system of taxing ended tax- farming and introduced taxing based on means rather than a flat rate. Finally, the third dealt with reformation in the area of human rights and the justice system. The accused were to be granted public trials; individuals could possess and dispose of property in freedom; and punishments were to fit the deed regardless of rank. Reward by merit was presented in this edict. Additionally, the edict emancipated minorities, which granted them the opportunity to be conscripted. However, conscription could be avoided by minorities if they paid the Jizya. This allowed minorities of means to avoid conscription and it allowed for the military to mostly maintain its purity of minorities. Below are some of the important clauses in detail: =Clauses= Some of the most important clauses are as follows: * In the future, the case of every accused party will be tried publicly, in conformity with our divine law. Until a regular sentence has been pronounced, no one can put another to death, secretly or publicly, by poison or any other form of punishment. * No one will be permitted to assail the honor of any one, whosoever he may be. * Every person will enjoy the possession of his property of every nature, and dispose of it with the most perfect liberty, without any one being able to impede him. Thus, for example, the innocent heirs of a criminal will not be deprived of their legal rights, and the property of the criminal will not be confiscated. * These imperial concessions extend to all our subjects, whatever religion or sect they may belong to; and they will enjoy them without any exception. * Perfect security is, therefore, granted by us to the inhabitants of the empire, with regard to their life, their honor, and their fortune, as the sacred text of our law demands. * With reference to the other points, as they must be regulated the concurrence of enlightened opinions, our Council of Justice (augmented by as many new members as may deemed necessary), to whom will be adjoined, on certain days which we shall appoint our Ministers and the Notables of the Empire, will meet for the purpose of establishing the fundamental laws on those points relating to the security of life and property, and the imposition of the taxes. Every one in these assemblies will state his ideas freely, and \\"give his advice freely.\\" * The laws relating to the regulations of the military service will be discussed by the Military Council, holding its meetings at the Place of the Serasker. As soon as a law is decided upon, it will be presented to us, and in order that it may be eternally valid and applicable will confirm it by our sanction, written above it with our imperial hand. * As these present institutions are solely intended for the regeneration of religion, government, the nation, and the Empire, we to do nothing which may be opposed to them. * In testimony of our promise we will, after having deposited these presents in the hall containing the glorious mantle of the Prophet, in the presence of all the ulama and the grandees of the Empire, make oath thereto in the name of God, and shall afterwards cause the oath to be taken by the ulama and grandees of the Empire.Herbert J. Liebesny The law of the Near and Middle East readings, cases, and materials, Albany: State University of New York Press * After that, those from among the ulama or the grandees of the Empire, or any other person whatsoever who shall infringe these institutions, shall undergo, without respect of rank, position, and influence, the punishment corresponding to his crime, after the latter has been fully established. A penal code shall be compiled for that purpose.Herbert J. Liebesny The law of the Near and Middle East readings, cases, and materials, Albany: State University of New York Press * As all the public servants of the Empire receive a suitable salary, and as the salaries of those whose duties have not up to the present time been sufficiently remunerated are to be fixed, a rigorous law shall be enacted against the traffic in favoritism and offices, which the divine law disapproves and which is one of the principal cause of the decay of the Empire.Herbert J. Liebesny The law of the Near and Middle East readings, cases, and materials, Albany: State University of New York Press Changes and effects of the Edict of G√ºlhane Some of the changes instituted by the Edict of G√ºlhane:Tanzimat *Reformed how the state related to its subjects; a more modern and unmediated relationship was developed. This helped the state run more efficiently. *Began secularization of the state through which a new legal system of the state emerged. A state, criminal law, with less stringent rules for prosecution, was introduced to supplement the sharia. *Explosion in the bureaucracy which transformed the efficiency of the state. While in the old system bureaucrats had no salary and were paid fees by individuals, the changes brought on by the Edict of G√ºlhane established a state salary and gave them education.

Delegation can be done explicitly, by passing the sending object to the receiving object, which can be done in any object- oriented language; or implicitly, by the member lookup rules of the language, which requires language support for the feature. Implicit delegation is the fundamental method for behavior reuse in prototype-based programming, corresponding to inheritance in class-based programming. The best-known languages that support delegation at the language level are Self, which incorporates the notion of delegation through its notion of mutable parent slots that are used upon method lookup on self calls, and JavaScript; see JavaScript delegation. The term delegation is also used loosely for various other relationships between objects; see delegation (programming) for more. Frequently confused concepts are simply using another object, more precisely referred to as consultation or aggregation; and evaluating a member on one object by evaluating the corresponding member on another object, notably in the context of the receiving object, which is more precisely referred to as forwarding (when a wrapper object doesn't pass itself to the wrapped object). The delegation pattern is a software design pattern for implementing delegation, though this term is also used loosely for consultation or forwarding. Overview This sense of delegation as programming language feature making use of the method lookup rules for dispatching so-called self- calls was defined by Lieberman in his 1986 paper \\"Using Prototypical Objects to Implement Shared Behavior in Object-Oriented Systems\\". Delegation is dependent upon dynamic binding, as it requires that a given method call can invoke different segments of code at runtime. It is used throughout macOS (and its predecessor NeXTStep) as a means of customizing the behavior of program components. It enables implementations such as making use of a single OS- provided class to manage windows, because the class takes a delegate that is program-specific and can override default behavior as needed. For instance, when the user clicks the close box, the window manager sends the delegate a windowShouldClose: call, and the delegate can delay the closing of the window, if there is unsaved data represented by the window's contents. Delegation can be characterized (and distinguished from forwarding) as late binding of self: That is, the in a method definition in the receiving object is not statically bound to that object at definition time (such as compile time or when the function is attached to an object), but rather at evaluation time, it is bound to the original object. It has been argued that delegation may in some cases be preferred to inheritance to make program code more readable and understandable.Trygve Reenskaug, Dept. of Informatics, University of Oslo, \\"The Case for Readable Code\\" (2007) Despite explicit delegation being fairly widespread, relatively few major programming languages implement delegation as an alternative model to inheritance. The precise relationship between delegation and inheritance is complicated; some authors consider them equivalent, or one a special case of the other. Language support for delegation In languages that support delegation via method lookup rules, method dispatching is defined the way it is defined for virtual methods in inheritance: It is always the most specific method that is chosen during method lookup. Hence it is the original receiver entity that is the start of method lookup even though it has passed on control to some other object (through a delegation link, not an object reference). Delegation has the advantage that it can take place at run time and affect only a subset of entities of some type and can even be removed at run time. Inheritance, by contrast, typically targets the type rather than the instances, and is restricted to compile time. On the other hand, inheritance can be statically type-checked, while delegation generally cannot without generics (although a restricted version of delegation can be statically typesafe). Delegation can be termed \\"run-time inheritance for specific objects.\\" Here is a pseudocode example in a C#/Java like language: class A { void foo() { // \\"this\\" also known under the names \\"current\\", \\"me\\" and \\"self\\" in other languages this.bar(); } void bar() { print(\\"a.bar\\"); } }; class B { private delegate A a; // delegation link public B(A a) { this.a = a; } void foo() { a.foo(); // call foo() on the a-instance } void bar() { print(\\"b.bar\\"); } }; a = new A(); b = new B(a); // establish delegation between two objects Calling will result in b.bar being printed, since refers to the original receiver object, , within the context of . The resulting ambiguity of is referred to as object schizophrenia. Translating the implicit into an explicit parameter, the call (in , with a delegate) translates to , using the type of for method resolution, but the delegating object for the argument. Using inheritance, the analogous code (using capital letters to emphasize that resolution is based on classes, not objects) is: class A { void foo() { this.bar(); } void bar() { print(\\"A.bar\\"); } }; class B extends A { public B() {} void foo() { super.foo(); // call foo() of the superclass (A) } void bar() { print(\\"B.bar\\"); } }; b = new B(); Calling will result in B.bar. In this case, is unambiguous: there is a single object, , and resolves to the method on the subclass. Programming languages in general do not support this unusual form of delegation as a language concept, but there are a few exceptions. =Dual inheritance= If the language supports both delegation and inheritance one can do dual inheritance by utilizing both mechanisms at the same time as in class C extends A { delegationlink D d; } This calls for additional rules for method lookup, as there are now potentially two methods that can be denoted as the most specific (due to the two lookup paths). =Related areas= Delegation can be described as a low level mechanism for sharing code and data between entities. Thus it builds the foundation for other language constructs. Notably role-oriented programming languages have been utilizing delegation, but especially the older ones factually used aggregation while claiming to use delegation. This should not be considered cheating, merely the plural definitions of what delegation means (as described above). More recently work has also been done on distributing delegation, so e.g. clients of a search engine (finding cheap hotel rooms) can use a shared entity using delegation to share best hits and general re-usable functionality. Delegation has also been suggested for advice resolution in aspect-oriented programming by Ernst and Lorenz in 2003.

It derives from the Greco-Buddhist art of the Gandhara district of what is now Afghanistan and Pakistan. Gandharan sculpture combined Indian traditions with Greek influences. Greek-influenced culture was most probably in existence prior to Alexander the Great's invasions, Afghanistan natives retained this influence which was lost in Greece. Modern researchers hypothesize that Buddhist missionaries travelling on the Silk Road introduced this artistic influence, along with Buddhism itself, into Serindia, resulting in a style that is a hybrid of Greek, Chinese and Persian. In modernity, Serindian art was rediscovered through the expeditions of Sir Aurel Stein in Central Asia at the beginning of the 20th century.

Both fore- and hind-wings consist of about six rigid spines, from which radiate flexible bristles creating a structure similar to a bird's feather. This is a small family, with about a global total of 210 species described to date (though it is likely that some undescribed species remain to be discovered). They are found mostly in temperate to subtropical (but not tropical) regions. But they are rare even in parts of their core range; both in Great Britain and North America for example, only one species is found - the twenty-plume moth (Alucita hexadactyla) - and in the latter region, it is introduced. This smallish moth can often be found fluttering in the evening twilight or resting with its \\"wings\\" outstretched. Its larvae feed on honeysuckle (Lonicera). On the other hand, in Continental Europe a considerable number of species, mostly of the large genus Alucita, occur. Systematics and taxonomy The taxonomy of this family is somewhat disputed. Here, they are united in superfamily Alucitoidea with the Tineodidae, a diverse group of numerous small genera with about 20 species all together. However, the two supposed Alucitoidea families may be polyphyletic with regard to each other, and Tineodidae better included in Alucitidae. In any case, the similar-looking plume moths (Pterophoroidea) are widely held to be very close, if not the closest living relatives of the Alucitoidea.Minet (1991) Earlier, many authors assumed that the fruitworm moths (Copromorphoidea) were also very closely related to the Alucitidae (and the fringe-tufted moths, Epermeniidae) - according to some, closer in fact than the Pterophoroidea and even the Tineodidae. In this Alucitoidea do not exist; Alucitidae and Tineodidae are assigned to different (but still most closely related) superfamilies. In the treatment here, the Copromorphoidea are presumed to be the most advanced of these lineages of small but fairly \\"modern\\" moths, while the Alucitoidea and Pterophoroidea are more primitive.Minet (1991), Wikispecies (2010) Genera The genera presently placed here, sorted alphabetically, are:Wikispecies (2010) * Alinguata * Alucita * Hebdomactis * Hexeretmis * Microschismus * Paelia * Prymnotomis * Pterotopteryx * Triscaedecia Footnotes References * .

Das christliche Adambuch des Morgenlandes. G√∂ttingen: Dieterich. It was first translated into English by S. C. MalanMalan, S. C. (1882). The Book of Adam and Eve: Also called the conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan, a book of the early Eastern Church. London, Williams and Norgate; repr. Kiesinger 2003, Gorgias Press 2010. from the German of Ernest Trumpp. The first half of Malan's translation is included as the \\"First Book of Adam and Eve\\" and the \\"Second Book of Adam and Eve\\" in The Lost Books of the Bible and the Forgotten Books of Eden. The books mentioned below were added by Malan to his English translation; the Ethiopic is divided into sections of varying length, each dealing with a different subject. Content Books 1 and 2 begin immediately after the expulsion from the Garden of Eden, and end with the testament and translation of Enoch. Great emphasis is placed in Book 1 on Adam's sorrow and helplessness in the world outside the garden. In Book 1, the punished Serpent attempts to kill Adam and Eve, but is prevented by God, who again punishes the Serpent by rendering it mute and casting it to India. Satan also attempts to deceive and kill Adam and Eve several times. In one of his attempts on their life, he throws a boulder which ends up encompassing Adam and Eve. God eventually saves them and compares this event with the upcoming Resurrection of Christ. God also predicts several other future Biblical events, including Noah and the flood. In Book 2, the \\"sons of God\\" who appear in are identified as the children of Seth, and the \\"daughters of men\\" as women descended from Cain, who successfully tempt most of the Sethites to come down from their mountain and join the Cainites in the valley below, under the instigation of Genun, son of Lamech. This Genun, as the inventor of musical instruments, seems to correspond to the Biblical Jubal; however he also invents weapons of war. The Cainites, descended from Cain the first murderer, are described as exceedingly wicked, being prone to commit murder and incest. After seducing the Sethites, their offspring become the Nephilim, the \\"mighty men\\" of Gen. 6 who are all destroyed in the deluge, as also detailed in other works such as I Enoch and Jubilees. Books 3 and 4 continue with the lives of Noah, Shem, Melchizedek, etc. through to the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus in AD 70. The genealogy from Adam to Jesus is given, as in the Gospels, but including also the names of the wives of each of Jesus' ancestors, which is extremely rare. Textual origin The Cave of Treasures is a Syriac work containing many of the same legends; indeed, as Malan remarks, a whole body of stories expanding upon the Old Testament is found in the Talmud, in the Koran, and in other late antique texts. Contradiction with the Bible * 1st Adam and Eve LXXVIII:16 says \\"Then on the morrow Adam said unto _Cain_ his son, 'Take of _thy sheep_ , young and good, and offer them up unto thy God; and I will speak to thy _brother_ , to make unto his God an offering of _corn_.'\\" while says \\"And in process of time it came to pass, that _Cain brought of the fruit of the ground_ an offering unto the LORD.

Introduction, Page 1. Retrieved December 29, 2017. Schucman claimed that the book had been dictated to her, word for word, via \\"inner dictation\\" from Jesus. The Course consists of three sections: the \\"Text\\", \\"Workbook for Students,\\" and \\"Manual for Teachers\\". Written from 1965 to 1972, some distribution occurred via photocopies before a hardcover edition was published in 1976 by the Foundation for Inner Peace. The copyright and trademarks, which had been held by two foundations, were revoked in 2004 after lengthy litigation, because the earliest versions had been circulated without a copyright notice. Throughout the 1980s annual sales of the book steadily increased each year; however the largest growth in sales occurred in 1992 after Marianne Williamson discussed the book on The Oprah Winfrey Show, with more than two million volumes sold. The book has been called everything from \\"New Age psychobabble\\" to \\"a Satanic seduction\\" to \\"The New Age Bible\\". According to Olav Hammer, the psychiatrist and bestselling author Gerald G. Jampolsky has been among the most effective promoters of the Course. His first book Love is Letting go of Fear, which is based on the principles of the Course, was published in 1979 and after being endorsed on Johnny Carson's show went on to sell over 3 million copies by 1990.Hammer, O, 2004, Claiming Knowledge : Strategies of Epistemology from Theosophy to the New Age, Studies in the history of religions 90, Brill, Leiden, Boston p451 Origins A Course in Miracles was written as a collaborative venture between Schucman and William ('Bill') Thetford. In 1958 Schucman began her professional career at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City as Thetford's research associate.Helen Schucman's Career In the spring of 1965, at a time when their weekly office meetings had become so contentious that they both dreaded them, Thetford suggested to Schucman that \\"[t]here must be another way\\". Schucman believed that this interaction acted as a stimulus, triggering a series of inner experiences that were understood by her as visions, dreams, and heightened imagery, along with an \\"inner voice\\" which she identified as Jesus. She said that on October 21, 1965, an \\"inner voice\\" told her: \\"This is a Course in Miracles, please take notes.\\" Schucman said that the writing made her very uncomfortable, though it never seriously occurred to her to stop.Skutch, Robert. Journey Without Distance: The Story Behind A Course in Miracles. Ten Speed Press, Berkeley, CA, 1984, p. 58. The next day, she explained the events of her \\"note taking\\" to Thetford. To her surprise, Thetford encouraged her to continue the process. He also offered to assist her in typing out her notes as she read them to him. The transcription the next day repeated itself regularly for many years to come. In 1972, the dictation of the three main sections of the Course was completed, with some additional minor dictation coming after that point.Final Dictation of The Song of Prayer Kenneth Wapnick helped edit the book and founded the Foundation for A Course in Miracles Fr. Benedict Groeschel, a Roman Catholic priest who had studied under Thetford and worked with Schucman, introduced Kenneth Wapnick to Schucman and Thetford in November 1972. Groeschel was given a copy of the ACIM manuscript in 1973 and was instructed by Schucman not to distribute the manuscript; however, with Schucman's permission, he made it available to Wapnick. Wapnick reviewed the draft and discussed with Schucman and Thetford, further revisions that he felt were needed to publish the book. Thetford made a few further editorial decisions about the \\"Principles of Miracles\\" section, and soon afterwards opted to withdraw from direct involvement. Wapnick and Schucman deleted personal material apparently directed only to Schucman and Thetford, created chapter and section headings, and corrected various inconsistencies in paragraph structure, punctuation, and capitalization. The editing process was completed by February 1975. Wapnick subsequently became a teacher of ACIM, a co-founder and president of the Foundation for A Course in Miracles (FACIM), and a director and executive committee member of the Foundation for Inner Peace (FIP). Contents The content of A Course in Miracles is presented in the three sections: \\"Textbook\\", \\"Workbook\\", and \\"Manual for Teachers\\": * The \\"Textbook\\" presents a thought system about truth and illusion on two levels: **It states that everything involving time, space, and perception is illusory. It presents a monism which states that God is the only truth and reality: perfect, unchanging, unchangeable, extending only love, though not in time and space, which cannot really be comprehended from a dualistic perspective. The theory further states that all life as we perceive it is actually one life (because God has only one son, sometimes called the collective sonship), dreaming of separation and fragmentation. It claims that eternity is outside time and space and that this dream never occurred in reality and is \\"already over\\", though not the (illusory) perception. When addressing the question of how such an illusory dream could arise from a perfect and unchanging God, the Course states that to ask that question is to presume that the time-space dream is real, which it states is not. A Course in Miracles states that to think we exist as individuals is the fundamental error. However, since we experience ourselves in time and space, reading these pages, the course presents its thought system on a second level: ** The time- space level, or \\"perceptory\\" level, which is referred to as \\"the dream\\". A Course in Miracles states that this level was \\"made\\" by the \\"sleeping Son\\" as an attack on God. Furthermore, the \\"Son\\" is regarded as not just Jesus, but as all collective life. In this time-space dream, perception is continuously fueled by what it originated from: separation, judgment, and attack. This results in what the Course calls the \\"sin-guilt-fear\\" cycle: we sinned by rejecting God and making a universe of time-space (the Big Bang); this results in guilt over our rejection of our Creator, and subsequent fear of God's wrath. The \\"sin-guilt-fear\\" is described as too horrendous to face, and therefore subsequently projected out, so that to Homo sapiens it seems that evil is everywhere except in himself. The world becomes a threatening place, in which we are born only to fear, fight, and die. The thought that keeps this process going is referred to as \\"ego\\", or \\"the wrong mind\\". A Course in Miracles concludes that happiness cannot be found in earthly time-space life, and urges the reader not to commit suicide but rather to make a fundamental mind shift from \\"condemnation-out-of-fear\\" (mindlessness) to \\"forgiveness-out- of-love\\" (mindfulness), since our \\"right mind\\" is outside time-space and cannot be harmed by worldly attacks. According to the course, seeing \\"the Face of Christ\\" in all living things is the way to \\"accept the Atonement\\" and ultimately awaken from the dream and return to the eternity of God. Ultimately, this means the end of individuality and of the ego. In this respect, there are parallels with the Indian concept of karma and the Bhagavad Gita, which Helen Schucman reports that she was not familiar with, although William Thetford was. The basic philosophy of the Course could be described as Vedanta in Christian dress and can be seen in the same tradition as other Eastern-influenced American religious and philosophical thought such as that of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Mary Baker Eddy and Joel S. Goldsmith. * The \\"Workbook\\" presents 365 lessons, one for each day of the year, which claim to recondition the student's mind from \\"condemnation-out-of-fear\\" to \\"forgiveness-out-of-love\\". A Course in Miracles defines \\"miracle\\" as the conscious choice to make that mind shift, including its non-observable effects on the minds of others. The workbook lessons attempt to train the reader to see oneness in all living things for a steadily increasing time of the day. The lessons aim at convincing by experience. The core message of the workbook is that, to forgive oneself completely, a person must (a) forgive all living things, and (b) do this by instruction of the Holy Spirit (i.e., the \\"Voice for God,\\" \\"right mind,\\" \\"Inner Teacher,\\" or \\"intuition\\"). At the end, after one year, the workbook states that it is \\"a beginning, not an end\\". * The \\"Manual for Teachers\\" is a collection of questions and answers. It aims at motivating the reader to become a \\"teacher of God\\": a human being living in time and space, but at the same time seeing oneness in everything, having let go of all individual and separate interests, and being fully guided by the \\"voice\\" of the Holy Spirit. * In the third edition, the two pamphlets \\"Psychotherapy\\" and \\"The Song of Prayer\\" were added. They elaborate on the parallels with current psychotherapy and on the meaning of prayer, respectively.  Foundation for Inner Peace and other editions  In 1975 a limited edition release of 300 copies of the first three sections of the book was published by The Foundation for Inner Peace, which had been created solely to publish A Course in Miracles. In June 1976, FIP published the first three sections of ACIM as three hardcover volumes in a 5,000 copy run, along with the publication of the supplemental booklet Psychology: Purpose, Process, Practice. In 1985, FIP began publishing a single soft-cover volume containing all three sections. In 1992, FIP published a second, hardcover edition. This revision added some editorial content and a verse-numbering system, as well as a \\"Clarification of Terms\\" section. At this time, FIP also published the supplemental Song of Prayer booklet. In October 2004, a long-standing copyright battle over A Course in Miracles ended with a ruling that put the work into the public domain. In January 2006, Course in Miracles Society, a non-profit established in Omaha, Nebraska, published A Course in Miracles- Original Edition (ACIM OE), which is the 1972 manuscript as completed by Helen Schucman and Bill Thetford. In August 2017, the Circle of Atonement published A Course in Miracles: Complete and Annotated Edition, which contains the original material that Helen Schucman wrote up to 1972, prior to the Foundation for Inner Peace edition. Reception Since it went on sale in 1976, the text has been translated into 22 languages. The book is distributed globally, spawning a range of organized groups.Bradby, Ruth, \\"A course in miracles in Ireland\\". 147 ‚Äì 162 in Olivia Cosgrove et al. (eds), Ireland's new religious movements. Cambridge Scholars, 2011 Wapnick said that \\"if the Bible were considered literally true, then (from a biblical literalist's viewpoint) the Course would have to be viewed as demonically inspired\\".Dean C. Halverson, \\"Seeing Yourself as Sinless\\", SCP Journal 7, no. 1 (1987): 23. Though a friend of Schucman, Thetford, and Wapnick, Catholic priest Benedict Groeschel has criticized ACIM and related organizations. Finding some elements of ACIM to be \\"severe and potentially dangerous distortions of Christian theology\\", he wrote that it is \\"a good example of a false revelation\\"Groeschel, Benedict J., A Still Small Voice (San Francisco: Ignatius Press, 1993) p. 80 and that it has \\"become a spiritual menace to many‚Äù.Groeschel, Benedict J., A Still Small Voice (San Francisco: Ignatius Press, 1993) p. 82 The evangelical editor Elliot Miller says that Christian terminology employed in ACIM is \\"thoroughly redefined\\" to resemble New Age teachings. Other Christian critics say that ACIM is \\"intensely anti-biblical\\" and incompatible with Christianity, blurring the distinction between creator and created and forcefully supporting the occult and New Age worldview. Olav Hammer locates A Course in Miracles in the tradition of channeled works from those of Madam Blavatsky through to the works of Rudolf Steiner and notes the close parallels between Christian Science and the teachings of the Course.Hammer, O, 2004, Claiming Knowledge : Strategies of Epistemology from Theosophy to the New Age, Studies in the history of religions 90, Brill, Leiden, Boston Alternatively it can be seen more broadly as part of the tradition of mystical literature described in William James' The Varieties of Religious Experience and Aldous Huxley's The Perennial Philosophy. In \\" ‚ÄòKnowledge is Truth‚Äô: A Course in Miracles as Neo- Gnostic Scripture\\" in Gnosis: Journal of Gnostic Studies Simon J Joseph clearly outlines the relationship between the Course and Gnostic thinking.Joseph, Simon J. \\"‚ÄòKnowledge is Truth‚Äô: A Course in Miracles as Neo- Gnostic Scripture\\" in Gnosis:Journal of Gnostic Studies, Volume 1, Issue 2, March 22, 2017 Daren Kemp also considers ACIM to be neo-Gnostic. The skeptic Robert T. Carroll criticized ACIM as \\"a minor industry\\" that is overly commercialized and characterizes it as \\"Christianity improved\\". Carroll said the teachings are not original and suggested they are culled from \\"various sources, east and west\\".

He became known and admired for his charitable acts, sincerity in prayer, and love for Eretz Yisrael. In his older years, he endeavored to emigrate there. He had two sons, Reb Boruch and another, Reb Yaakov Dovid, who died during his lifetime. His son-in-law was the son of Rabbi Yehoshua Rokeach of Belz, Reb Shmuel of Sokal. His Torah thoughts were published under the title Tzemach Tzaddik. He died on October 18, 1884, and was buried in Vyzhnytsia. His son Reb Boruch took his place, becoming the second Rebbe of Vizhnitz. =Boruch Hager= Boruch Hager was born in 1845 and was named after Rabbi Boruch of Medzhybizh at the behest of his grandfather, Yisroel Friedman of Ruzhyn. In 1885, aged 40, he inherited the mantle of leadership from his father, Menachem Mendel Hager, and became rebbe to thousands of Hasidim. He led them for only eight years until his death in 1892. His Torah thoughts were collected in Imrei Boruch by his son-in-law. Eight of his sons became rebbes in different locals: His eldest, Reb Yisroel, succeeded him in Vyzhnytsia; Reb Chaim became rebbe in Ottynia; Reb Moshe in Suceava; Reb Shmuel Avrohom Abba in Horodenka; Reb Yaakov Yitzchok Dovid in Storozhynets; Reb Pinchos in Borsha; Reb Feivish in Zelishtshik; Reb Yechiel Michel succeeded his brother in Horodenka. Another son, Reb Sholom, died in his youth. His sons-in-law were Reb Shmuel Dov Chodorov of Petriva; Reb Mordechai Chodorov of Kolomea, who published Imrey Boruch; Reb Sholom Yosef Friedman of Sadigur-Chernovitz. =Yisroel Hager= Yisroel Hager was born on August 20, 1860. He was the first-born son of Rabbi Boruch Hager. He married the daughter of Rabbi Meir Horowitz of Dzhikov. In 1875, he moved to his father-in-law's house and studied at great length with his brother-in-law Rabbi Yehoshua of Dzikov. Three years later he returned to Vyzhnytsia and became very close to his grandfather, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Hager. In 1893 he was appointed as rebbe in Vyzhnytsia. The young rebbe invigorated the dynasty and attracted many more followers from the surrounding provinces. He established many Talmud Torahs, and also a yeshiva, to which he appointed his son Rabbi Menachem Mendel as rosh yeshiva. When World War I broke out he was forced to move to Grosswardein (Oradea). He lived there until his death on 2 June 1936.Der Israelit, 4 June 1936, p. 13 In 1949, his remains were transferred to Israel and re-interred in Zichron Meir, Bnei Brak. His sons were Reb Menachem Mendel of Visheve, Reb Chaim Meir (Chayim Meir'l), who inherited his father's position in Grosswardein; Reb Eliezer of Vyzhnytsia; Reb Boruch of Siret; and Reb Shmuel Abba who died young. He also had six daughters. =Chaim Meir Hager= After the Holocaust, Reb Chaim Meir settled in Bnei Brak, Israel, to build a community there. Disciples from pre- war Europe gathered around him, and formed a comprehensive net of educational and communal institutions. He became a spiritual mentor of the Agudas Yisrael party in the Israeli Knesset. Agudas Yisrael won substantial government aid for Bnei Brak and affiliated communities, in return for its support in coalition governments.The Roots of Hasidism: The Two Viznitz's (nyc- architecture.com) Reb Chaim Meir had two sons: the older Moshe (Reb Moshelle), and the younger Mordechai (Reb Mottele). Reb Chaim Meir's sons-in- law include Rabbis Yidele Horowitz, Yitzchok Yaakov Weiss (both were married to Reb Chaim Meir's daughter, Miriam),Invitation written by Reb Yisroel Hager to the wedding of his granddaughter Miriam and Reb Yidele Horowitz (in Hebrew) and Yisrael Friedman (married to Reb Chaim Meir's daughter, Tziporah. Their son is Hoshea Friedman). =Moshe Yehoshua Hager= Rabbi Moshe Yehoshua Hager, was the Vizhnitser Rebbe in Bnei Brak. He died on March 13, 2012, aged 95.Rabbi Moshe Hager, a Hasidic Leader, Dies at 95 He had two sons and four daughters. His elder son is Rabbi Yisroel, named after his grandfather, the \\"Ahavas Yisroel\\"; his other son is Rabbi Menachem Mendel, named after the founding Vizhnitzer Rebbe, author of Tzemach Tzaddik. Rabbi Moshe Yehoshua's sons-in-law are famous rabbis. The eldest daughter married Rabbi David Twersky, the Skverer Rebbe of New Square, New York. One daughter married Rabbi Yissachar Dov Rokeach, the Belzer Rebbe from Jerusalem. One daughter married Rabbi Aaron Teitelbaum, the Satmar Rebbe from Kiryas Joel, New York. The youngest daughter married Rabbi Menachem Ernster, the rosh yeshiva of the Vizhnitz Yeshiva in Bnei Brak.

More specifically, the original aim was to define a single specification for operating systems derived from UNIX, to increase the interoperability of applications and reduce the cost of porting software. Its original members were Bull, ICL, Siemens, Olivetti, and Nixdorf‚Äîa group sometimes referred to as BISON. Philips and Ericsson joined soon afterwards, at which point the name X/Open was adopted. The group published its specifications under the name X/Open Portability Guide (or XPG). Issue 1 covered basic operating system interfaces, and was published within a year of the group's formation. Issue 2 followed in 1987, and extended the coverage to include Internationalization, Terminal Interfaces, Inter-Process Communication, and the programming languages C, COBOL, FORTRAN, and Pascal, as well as data access interfaces for SQL and ISAM. In many cases these were profiles of existing international standards. XPG3 followed in 1988, its primary focus being convergence with the POSIX operating system specifications. This was probably the most widely used and influential deliverable of the X/Open organisation. By 1990 the group had expanded to 21 members: in addition to the original five, Philips and Nokia from Europe; AT&T; Corporation, Digital, Unisys, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, NCR, Sun Microsystems, Prime Computer, Apollo Computer from North America; Fujitsu, Hitachi, and NEC from Japan; plus the Open Software Foundation and Unix International. X/Open managed the UNIX trademark from 1993 to 1996, when it merged with the Open Software Foundation to form The Open Group. X/Open was also responsible for the XA protocol for heterogeneous distributed transaction processing, which was released in 1991.  Output  The X/Open Portability Guide is a standard for UNIX systems originally published by X/Open Company Ltd. Based on the AT&T; System V Interface Definition, it has a wider scope than POSIX, which is only concerned with direct operating system interfaces. The Portability Guide specifies a Common Application Environment (CAE) intended to allow portability of applications across operating systems. The primary aim was compatibility between different vendors' implementations of UNIX, though some vendors also implemented the standards on non-UNIX platforms. The XPG3 and XPG4 standards, released in 1989 and 1992 respectively, define all aspects of the operating system, programming languages and protocols which compliant systems should have. The last version of the XPG, the X/Open Portability Guide Issue 4 (also known as the Common Applications Environment Specification Issue 4 (CAE4)), was published in July 1992 by The Open Group. The Single UNIX Specification was based on the XPG4 standard. = Chapters = The XPG4 specification includes these chapters: * System Interfaces and Headers (XSH), Issue 4, , C202 * Commands and Utilities (XCU), Issue 4, , C203 * System Interface Definitions (XBD), Issue 4, , C204 See also *Joint Inter-Domain Management  References  * - Mentions X/Open; lists members and its efforts to define \\"a new standard interface to UNIX\\". *ICL and Europe, by Virgilio Pasquali, from RESURRECTION, The Bulletin of the Computer Conservation Society, Number 35, Summer 2005 - Contains more on history of X/Open * C.

He played for 18 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a catcher for the St. Louis Browns, Boston Red Sox, and Washington Senators, from 1929 through 1947. His brother, Wes Ferrell, was a major league pitcher for 15 seasons, and they were teammates from 1933 through part of 1938 on the Red Sox and Senators. Following his three seasons in minor league baseball, he appealed to the Commissioner of Baseball to become a free agent, claiming that he was being held in the minors though he deserved promotion. The Commissioner agreed, and he was granted free agency; he signed with the St. Louis Browns. Ferrell was regarded as one of the best catchers in baseball during the 1930s and early 1940s. While playing for the Red Sox in 1933, he and his brother Wes were selected to play for the American League (AL) team in the inaugural 1933 Major League Baseball All-Star Game held on July 6, 1933. His 1,806 games played as a catcher set an AL longevity record which stood for more than 40 years. A seven-time All-Star, Ferrell was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1984 by the Veterans Committee. After his playing career, he became a coach with the Senators, and later a scout and general manager with the Detroit Tigers. He died in July 1995. Early life Richard Benjamin Ferrell was born on October 12, 1905 in Durham, North Carolina, to Rufus and Alice, and grew up on a 160-acre dairy farm near Greensboro, North Carolina. He was one of seven boys, and two of his brothers enjoyed long careers in baseball. Wes Ferrell reached the major leagues as a pitcher while another brother, George Ferrell, played as an outfielder in minor league baseball. Rick attended Guilford College in Greensboro where he played both baseball and basketball. In 1926, he was signed by the Detroit Tigers of the American League (AL), and was assigned to play for the Kinston Eagles of the Virginia League. Shortly afterward, he was promoted to the Columbus Senators of the American Association, and in 1928 he posted a .333 batting average with them. His performance that season earned him an American Association All-Star position. During the season, he personally asked Detroit's owner, Frank Navin, if the organization had a plan in place to bring him up to the Tigers. Navin told him to be patient and return to Columbus. When the season concluded, another Columbus catcher, Hugh McMullen, was called up to the major leagues, but to the Cincinnati Reds instead of the Tigers. Confused as to who actually owned his contract, Ferrell inquired with the Reds about his status with the organization, and was again told to return to Columbus. After reading through his contract, he believed he was being unfairly held in the minor leagues, so he petitioned the Commissioner of Baseball, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, to grant him a hearing.Ferrell; Anderson, Pg. 10 It was discovered that Columbus owner, Joseph Carr, had been shopping Ferrell's contract, receiving offers as high as $50,000 (), though none were formally presented on paper. Navin protested to Landis, claiming he was unaware of what Carr was doing. After the Commissioner completed his investigation, he determined that the Tigers and Reds had colluded to keep Ferrell in the minor leagues, and directed Carr to shop for buyers. This move by the two teams effectively hid him from the other major league teams' draft rights to increase Ferrell's sale price. This was a common, although illegal, practice during this era, so Landis declared Ferrell a free agent, allowing him to sign a contract with any team he chose, except the Tigers. After receiving offers from many major league clubs, he signed a contract with the St. Louis Browns of the AL for $25,000 (). Major leagues Ferrell made his major league debut with the Browns on April 19, 1929. He spent the 1929 season as a reserve catcher backing up veteran Wally Schang, and had a .229 batting average in 64 games. New Browns manager and former catcher, Bill Killefer, made Ferrell his starting catcher for the next three seasons, and he would catch in more than 100 games in each. His batting average rose to .306 in 1931, elevating him one to one of the best catchers in the American League. Although he led the league's catchers in errors and passed balls, he also led the league in assists. In 1932, Ferrell hit .315, the best among American League catchers, with 30 doubles and 65 runs batted in. He ended the season ranked 13th in voting for the 1932 American League Most Valuable Player Award. Ferrell in 1934 On May 10, 1933, the financially strained Browns traded Ferrell, along with Lloyd Brown to the Boston Red Sox, in exchange for Merv Shea and some cash. Two months later, Ferrell was selected along with his brother to play for the American League team in the inaugural Major League Baseball All-Star Game held on July 6, 1933. American League manager Connie Mack used Ferrell to catch the entire game in a 4‚Äì2 American League victory, even though future Baseball Hall of Fame catchers Mickey Cochrane and Bill Dickey were also on the team. When the Red Sox played the Cleveland Indians two weeks later on July 19, 1933, Ferrell hit a home run against his brother Wes, who later hit a home run off Boston pitcher Hank Johnson, marking the first time in major league history that brothers on opposing teams had hit home runs in the same game. Ferrell ended the year with a .290 batting average along with a career-high 77 runs batted in. Although Ferrell once again led American League catchers in errors, he also led in assists and in baserunners caught stealing. Despite the Red Sox' seventh-place finish, Ferrell ranked 12th in voting for the 1933 American League Most Valuable Player Award. In 1934, the Red Sox signed Ferrell's brother Wes, forming a formidable battery for the next three and half seasons. Rick ended the year with a .297 batting average and led the league's catchers in fielding percentage and in putouts and finished second in assists. With Ferrell calling the pitches in 1935, his brother pitched to a 25‚Äì14 won‚Äìloss record, and was runner-up to Hank Greenberg in voting for the 1935 American League Most Valuable Player Award. Ferrell posted a .301 batting average for the year and led the league in baserunners caught stealing. Ferrell had another good year in 1936, leading the league with a .439 batting average at the beginning of May to earn the starting catcher's berth for the American League team in the 1936 All-Star Game. He ended the season with a .312 batting average along with career-highs in home runs (8) and in on-base percentage (.406). He also led the league's catchers in putouts and finished second in fielding percentage. In June 1937, Ferrell was hitting for a .308 batting average when he was traded to the Washington Senators along with his brother and Mel Almada for pitcher Bobo Newsom and outfielder Ben Chapman. Between 1933 and 1936, Ferrell broke Red Sox catchers' records in batting average, doubles, home runs and runs batted in. His .302 batting average with Boston is currently 15th on the club's all-time list. Ferrell in 1936 Playing with a broken right hand, he ended the year with the Senators and batted .244 over the course of the season. Ferrell rebounded in 1938 with a .298 batting average and led the league in baserunners caught stealing. The Senators released his brother Wes in August 1938. In May 1941, Ferrell was traded back to the St. Louis Browns, in exchange for Vern Kennedy, and went on to catch 100 games for the sixth- place Browns. In 1942, the 36-year-old Ferrell shared catching duties with Frankie Hayes as the Browns improved to an 82-69 won-loss record to finish the year in third place. Ferrell was once again traded; this time he returned to the Senators in March 1944. He earned a reputation as one of the best knuckleball catchers in baseball when he had the arduous task of catching for a Senators' starting pitching staff made up entirely of knuckleball pitchers. Dutch Leonard, Johnny Niggeling, Roger Wolff, and Mickey Haefner all threw the notoriously difficult-to-catch knuckleball, making Ferrell the first catcher in major league history to accomplish the feat. Although Ferrell led the league in passed balls due to the unpredictability of the knuckleball, he was still named to his seventh All-Star Game. The Senators ended the season in last place while Ferrell's former team, the St. Louis Browns won the 1944 American League pennant. Ferrell shared catching duties with Al Evans in 1945 as the Senators started to win regularly. On July 6, 1945, Ferrell broke Ray Schalk's American League record for most games caught with 1,721. The 1945 All-Star Game which was supposed to be played on July 10 was cancelled on April 24 due to wartime travel restrictions, and no All-Stars were officially named that season.Baseball Did You Know? ‚Äì VII, 1945 All Star Game Replacements Retrieved July 28, 2015 In place of the All-Star Game, seven out of eight scheduled interleague games were played on July 9 and 10 that raised funds for the American Red Cross and War Relief Fund. In the final week of the 1945 season, the Senators came within one and a half games of winning the American League pennant, ultimately clinched by the Detroit Tigers. Ferrell retired as a player to become a Senators' coach for the 1946 season. However, he returned to play as a catcher for 37 games in 1947, hitting for a .303 batting average. He played his final major league game on September 14, 1947 at the age of 41. Post-playing career and legacy Plaque of Rick Ferrell at the Baseball Hall of Fame In an 18-year career, Ferrell played in 1,884 games, accumulating 1,692 hits in 6,028 at bats for a .281 career batting average along with 28 home runs, 734 runs batted in and an impressive on-base percentage of .378. He hit over .300 four times during his career, and his on- base percentage is eighth all-time among the 50 catchers with 3,000 at bats. A patient hitter, Ferrell logged just 277 strikeouts during his career, along with 931 bases on balls. He ended his career with a .984 fielding percentage. An eight-time All-Star with a strong throwing arm, he led American League catchers four times in baserunners caught stealing, and twice in assists and putouts. Ferrell retired having caught 1,806 games, an American League record that stood until Carlton Fisk surpassed it in 1988. He currently ranks 12th all-time in games played as a catcher. Ferrell continued as a coach for the Senators in 1948 and 1949. He then joined the Detroit Tigers as a coach from 1950 to 1954 before retiring from the field altogether. Afterwards, he served as a scout then as the scouting director for the Tigers before becoming the general manager and vice president in 1959. He held the position for four years, with veteran executive Bill DeWitt taking the leading role in baseball operations from late through the season as club president, before turning the general manager role over to Jim Campbell at the close of the campaign. Ferrell remained with the team as a senior member of its front office. During his tenure as a Tigers executive, the team won two World Series championships, in 1968 and in 1984, and won two American League Eastern Division titles in 1972 and in 1987. In his book, The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, baseball historian Bill James ranked Ferrell as the third best catcher in the American League during his career, behind only Mickey Cochrane and Bill Dickey. Ferrell was elected by the Veterans Committee, along with Pee Wee Reese, to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1984. He retired in at the age of 87 after 42 years with the Tigers organization. Ferrell was married to Ruth Virginia Wilson from 1941 until her death in 1968. Together they had four children, two sons and two daughters. His family first lived in Greensboro, then later in Grosse Pointe, Michigan. He lived in Troy, Michigan for the remaining 18 years of his life, until he was admitted into a nursing home in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. It was here that he died of arrhythmia on July 27, 1995, and is interred at New Garden Cemetery in Greensboro, North Carolina.

Dogged by financial issues most of his life, he died in King's Bench Prison in 1726. Life Ker was born on 8 August 1673, eldest son of Alexander Crawfurd of Fergushill who appears as a Commissioner of Supply in the 1685 records of the Parliament of Scotland. He married Anna, younger daughter of Robert Ker, of Kersland, near Kilbirnie, whose only son Daniel Ker was killed at the Battle of Steinkeerke in 1692. Anna's elder sister Jean Ker sold him the family estates in 1697 and thereafter he assumed the name and arms of Ker. Career The 1690s were a time of extreme economic hardship and famine in Scotland, known as the seven ill years; in December 1696, the city of Edinburgh set up a refugee camp in Greyfriars kirkyard to house starving rural migrants.K. J. Cullen, Famine in Scotland: The ‚ÄúIll Years‚Äù of the 1690s (Edinburgh University Press, 2010), , p. 160. This impacted the viability of small estates such as Fergushill and John was already under financial pressure when he purchased Kersland. Having become a leader among the extreme Covenanters, he made use of his influence to relieve his pecuniary embarrassments, selling his support at one time to the Jacobites, at another to the government, and whenever possible to both parties at the same time. He held a licence from the government in 1707 permitting him to associate with those whose disloyalty was known or suspected, proving that he was at that date the government's paid spy. In his Memoirs Ker asserts that he had a number of other spies and agents working under his orders in different parts of the country. cites He entered into correspondence with Catholic priests and Jacobite conspirators, whose schemes, so far as he could make himself cognisant of them, he betrayed to the government. But he was known to be a man of the worst character, and it is improbable that he succeeded in gaining the confidence of people of any importance. The Duchess of Gordon was for a time, it is true, one of his correspondents, but in 1707 she had discovered him to be a knave. He went to London in 1709, where he seems to have extracted considerable sums of money from politicians of both parties by promising or threatening, as the case might be, to expose Godolphin's relations with the Jacobites. King's Bench Prison ca 1808‚Äì11. In 1713, if his own story is to be believed, business of a semi-diplomatic nature took Ker to Vienna, where, although he failed in the principal object of his errand, the Emperor made him a present of his portrait set in jewels. Ker also occupied his time in Vienna, he says, by gathering information which he forwarded to the electress Sophia; and in the following year on his way home he stopped at Hanover to give some advice to the future King of Great Britain as to the best way to govern the English. Although in his own opinion Ker materially assisted in placing George I on the British throne, his services were unrewarded, owing, he would have us believe, to the incorruptibility of his character. Similar ingratitude was the recompense for his revelations of the Jacobite intentions in 1715, and as he was no more successful in making money out of the British East India Company, nor in certain commercial schemes which engaged his ingenuity during the next few years, he died in a debtor's prison. While in the King's Bench Prison he sold to Edmund Curll the bookseller, a fellow-prisoner who was serving a sentence of five months for publishing obscene books, the manuscript of (or possibly only the materials on which were based) the Memoirs of John Ker of Kersland, which Curll published in 1726 in three parts, the last of which appeared after Ker's death. For issuing the first part of the Memoirs, which purported to make disclosures damaging to the government, but which Curll in self- justification described as vindicating the memory of Queen Anne, the publisher was sentenced to the pillory at Charing Cross; and he added to the third part of the Memoirs the indictment on which he had been convicted.

He played his entire 14-year Major League Baseball (MLB) career for the Boston Red Sox (1937‚Äì1951). A nine- time MLB All-Star, Doerr batted over .300 three times, drove in more than 100 runs six times, and set Red Sox team records in several statistical categories despite missing one season due to military service during World War II. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1986. After he retired as a player, Doerr served as a scout and a coach; he worked with Carl Yastrzemski before his Triple Crown season. From April 25, 2017, until his death on November 13 of that year, Doerr was the oldest living former major league player. He was the last living person who played in the major leagues in the 1930s, and was the oldest of only three living people who made their MLB debut before U.S. involvement in World War II (the other two being Chuck Stevens and Fred Caligiuri).Baseball Almanac. Retrieved March 5, 2015. Early life Doerr was the son of Harold Doerr, a telephone company supervisor, and his wife, the former Frances Herrnberger; his middle name was a tribute to General of the Armies John J. Pershing, then the commander of U.S. military forces in World War I. He graduated from Los Angeles' Fremont High School in 1936, and by then, had already begun his professional career with the 1934 and 1935 Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League (PCL). While playing for the San Diego Padres of the PCL in 1936, Doerr met Ted Williams. The future Red Sox teammates became close friends for many years. Doerr played in 175 games for San Diego that year, batting .342. He led the league with 238 hits, including 37 doubles and 12 triples. MLB playing career =Early career= Doerr broke into the majors in 1937 at the age of 19 and went 3-for-5 in his first game. In 1938, he became a regular in the Red Sox lineup. Doerr led the league with 22 sacrifice hits in 1938. In 1939, Doerr began a string of 12 consecutive seasons with 10 or more home runs and 73 or more runs batted in (RBIs); in 1940 the Red Sox became the 12th team in major league history to have four players with 100 RBIs, with Foxx, Williams, Cronin and Doerr each collecting at least 105. =All-Star seasons and the World Series= In 1941, Doerr was an All-Star, the first of nine times he was selected for the AL All- Star team. In 1944, Doerr led the league in slugging percentage. The same year, his .325 batting average was good enough to allow him to finish second in the league, two percentage points behind Lou Boudreau of the Cleveland Indians. The Sporting News named him Most Valuable Player for the American League (AL), although he finished only seventh in Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award voting for the AL. Doerr hit for the cycle twice in his career; on May 17, 1944, in a 12‚Äì8 loss to the St. Louis Browns in the second game of a doubleheader, and again on May 13, 1947, in a 19‚Äì6 win over the Chicago White Sox. Doerr missed the 1945 season while serving in the Army during World War II, being stationed at Camp Roberts, California. In 1946, Doerr finished third in MVP voting for the AL (won by Williams, his teammate). Doerr drove in 116 runs despite a .271 average. He hit .409 in the 1946 World Series loss to the St. Louis Cardinals, with a home run and three RBIs. Doerr's average dropped to .258 in 1947 as he grounded into a league-high 25 double plays, but he had 95 RBIs. He hit .285 with 27 home runs and 111 RBIs in 1948. Doerr had set an AL record in that year by handling 414 chances in a row over 73 games without an error. =Final years as a player= In 1949, Doerr hit .309 with 18 home runs and 109 RBIs. At the start of the 1950 season, Doerr was in a slump; he was only batting .232 as of June 2. However, he finished the year with a league-leading 11 triples, and batted .294. On June 8 of that year, he hit three home runs in a 29‚Äì4 romp over the Browns. He set career highs that year in triples, runs (103) and RBIs (120); he tied his career high in home runs (27). Doerr appeared in only 106 games in 1951 and he retired that September after suffering from a spinal problem for two years. =Career totals= Doerr retired with 8,028 plate appearances, 1,094 runs, 89 triples, 809 walks, 1,349 singles, 1,184 runs created, 693 extra base hits, 2,862 times on base, 115 sacrifice hits and nine All-Star Game selections. At Fenway Park, he hit .315 with 145 home runs, compared to a .261 average and 78 HR on the road. Doerr batted over .300 three times, with six seasons of at least 100 RBIs. He never played a game at a position other than second base. Regarded as one of the top defensive second basemen of his era, Doerr led AL second basemen in double plays five times, tying a league record, in putouts and fielding percentage four times each, and in assists three times. Doerr held the major league record for career double plays at second base (1,507) until 1963. He set Red Sox records for career games (1,865), at bats (7,093), hits (2,042), doubles (381), total bases (3,270) and RBIs (1,247),Doerr ended his career with 1,247 RBIs, but Williams had passed that RBI total earlier in the year. All of Doerr's offensive Red Sox records were later broken by Williams, who referred to Doerr as \\"the silent captain of the Red Sox.\\" His 223 home runs were then the third most by a major league second baseman.\\"The National Baseball Hall of Fame\\" . Retrieved February 3, 2007. Later MLB career After spending a few years as a cattle rancher in Oregon, Doerr returned to baseball. He became a scout for the Red Sox from 1957 to 1966, also serving as a minor league hitting instructor for the team for the last six seasons of that span. He was hired as the first base coach for the Red Sox in 1967 under new manager Dick Williams. The Red Sox won their first pennant in 20 years and played in the 1967 World Series. Doerr resigned from the Red Sox when Williams was fired as manager in September 1969. He was the hitting coach for the expansion Toronto Blue Jays from 1977 to 1981. Later life Doerr lived in Oregon from the late 1930s till his death, residing in the vicinity of Agness for much of his career before relocating to Junction City in the 1950s. Doerr was married to Monica Terpin from October 1938 until her death in 2003; she had lived with multiple sclerosis since the 1940s. They had one son. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1986. His jersey number 1 was retired by the Red Sox on May 21, 1988. He made annual trips to the Hall of Fame induction at Cooperstown, New York until 2008, after which he stopped attending. On July 29, 2007, the Hall of Fame honored Doerr after the induction of Cal Ripken, Jr. and Tony Gwynn. Reflecting on being inducted into the Hall of Fame and having his number retired by the Red Sox, Doerr said, \\"If I had played on a world champion, that would have made my life complete.\\" On August 2, 2007, the Red Sox held \\"Bobby Doerr Day\\" at Fenway Park where he rode along the warning track in a car, threw out the first pitch, and gave a speech. Doerr had what was characterized as a minor stroke on August 11, 2011. He attended the Fenway Park 100th anniversary celebration on April 20, 2012. =Longevity and records= Upon the death of former New York Yankees executive and American League president Lee MacPhail in November 2012, Doerr became the oldest living member of the Baseball Hall of Fame. He became the oldest living former Red Sox player upon the death of Lou Lucier in October 2014. On November 4, 2016, Doerr became the oldest living former major leaguer upon the death of Eddie Carnett. Doerr was the last surviving member of the 1946 Boston Red Sox team that won the AL pennant and lost the World Series in seven games to the St. Louis Cardinals. He was also the last living person who played in the major leagues during the 1930s, and the last living person who played against Lou Gehrig.

The Jewish Culture Festival in Krak√≥w (, ) is an annual cultural event organized since 1988 in the once Jewish district of Kazimierz (part of Krak√≥w) by the Jewish Culture Festival Society headed by Janusz Makuch, a self-described meshugeneh, fascinated with all things Jewish. The main goal of the festival is to educate people about Jewish culture, history and faith (Judaism), which flourished in Poland before the Holocaust, as well as to familiarize them with modern Jewish culture developing mostly in the United States and Israel, and finally, to provide entertainment. Each festival is held in late June or early July and takes nine days, from Saturday to Sunday. During that time concerts, exhibitions, plays, lectures, workshops, tours, etc. are organized. The two most important concerts are: the inaugural concert on the first Sunday, and the final concert on the last Saturday of the festival. The former usually takes place in one of seven synagogues of Kazimierz and features cantoral music; the latter is always held outdoors, in Ulica Szeroka, the main street of the Jewish part of Kazimierz, and features klezmer music. In between there are many more concerts, usually with some variations of klezmer music. The workshops provide an occasion to learn about traditional Jewish cuisine, dance, music, calligraphy and other aspects of Jewish culture. More about Jewish culture, as well as about topics related to the Holocaust, is taught at numerous lectures. Exhibitions of Jewish art, particularly paper-cut, are also organized. The program of the festival also includes tours of the synagogues and cemeteries of Kazimierz as well as the former Nazi-era Krak√≥w Ghetto in the nearby district of Podg√≥rze. During the festival Gentiles are also invited to watch or participate in Jewish prayers at the synagogue. Jewish Culture Festival brings together artists of Jewish culture from all over the world - music bands, soloists, choirs, jazz musicians and dance teachers. The festival promotes a whole variety of different styles of Jewish music: synagogue song, hasidic, classical, Jewish folk and ‚Äì very popular in Krakow nowadays ‚Äì klezmer. For the Poles this event is a way of promotion of Jewish culture and paying a homage to the community that used to live in Poland, although many Jews were reportedly offended by the commercialization of Polish Jewish culture. \\"Others argue that there is something deeper taking place in Poland as the country heals from the double wounds of Nazi and Communist domination.\\" It is one of Poland's major annual cultural events and one of the biggest festivals of Jewish culture in the world. Artists and entertainers usually associated with the festival include: Benzion Miller, Yaakov Stark, David Krakauer, Frank London, Leopold Koz≈Çowski, Michael Alpert, Theodore Bikel, Paul Brody and many others. Jewish dances are led by Steven Weintraub.

This construction is similar to the passive voice, in that it decreases the verb's valency by one -- the passive by deleting the agent and \\"promoting\\" the object to become the subject of the passive construction, the antipassive by deleting the object and \\"promoting\\" the agent to become the subject of the antipassive construction. The antipassive voice is found in some Mayan, Salishan, Northeast Caucasian, Austronesian, and Australian languages as well as in Basque.Antipassive constructions Accessed 24 April 2014 One Amazonian language, Cavine√±a, also has an antipassive.Dixon, R.M.W. & Alexandra Y. Aikhenvald (eds) (1990). The Amazonian Languages. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Occurrence The antipassive voice is predominantly found in ergative languages where the deletion of an object \\"promotes\\" the subject from ergative case to absolutive case. In certain accusative languages that have verbal agreement with both subject and object, the antipassive is usually formed by deletion of the object affix. Examples of accusative languages with this type of antipassive are Maasai, Comanche and Cahuilla. A number of direct‚Äìinverse languages also have the antipassive voice. The antipassive voice is very rare in active‚Äìstative languages generally and in nominative‚Äìaccusative languages that have only one-place or no verbal agreement.Nichols, Johanna; Linguistic Diversity in Space and Time; pp. 154-158. There are a very few exceptions to this rule, such as KrongoWALS - Krongo and the Songhay language Koyraboro Senni,WALS - Koyraboro Senni both of which rely on dedicated antipassive markers that are rare in the more typical type of language with an antipassive. Examples =K'iche'= In the Mayan language K'iche', the core arguments of a clause are unmarked for case, and are cross-referenced by person markers on the verb. Person marking follows an ergative‚Äìabsolutive pattern. Non-core participants are expressed by prepositional phrases. In the following transitive clause, the object \\"your mother\\" is the absolutive argument. It is unmarked for case and is not overtly cross-referenced, since the absolutive third person singular prefix is zero. The agent \\"you\\" is represented by the ergative second person singular prefix a-. : In the corresponding antipassive clause, which is formally intransitive, the verb takes the antipassive suffix -on. The original object \\"your mother\\" is now expressed by a prepositional phrase, while the agent \\"you\\" has become the subject argument and is thus expressed by the absolutive second person singular prefix at-. : Function Antipassives frequently convey aspectual or modal information and may cast the clause as imperfective, inceptive, or potential. The purpose of antipassive construction is often to make certain arguments available as pivots for relativization, coordination of sentences, or similar constructions. For example, in Dyirbal the omitted argument in conjoined sentences must be in absolutive case. Thus, the following sentence is ungrammatical: : :- man- come- - woman- see- :'The man came and saw the woman' In the conjoined sentence, the omitted argument (the man) would have to be in ergative case, being the agent of a transitive verb (to see). This is not allowed in Dyirbal. In order to make this sentence grammatical, the antipassive, which promotes the original ergative to absolutive and puts the former absolutive (the woman) into dative case has to be used: : :- man- come- - woman- see-- :'The man came and saw the woman' Defining \\"antipassive\\" The term antipassive is applied to a wide range of grammatical structures and is therefore difficult to define. R. M. W. Dixon has nonetheless proposed four criteria for determining whether a construction is an antipassive:Dixon, R.M.W. (1994). Ergativity. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. # It applies to clauses containing traditionally transitive predicates and forms a derived intransitive. # The Agent takes the Subject role. # The Object takes a peripheral role in the clause, getting marked by a non-core case/preposition/etc. This can be omitted, but there's always the option of including it. # There is some explicit marking of the construction.  Examples from Basque  Basque has an antipassive voice which puts the agent into the absolutive case but does not delete the absolutive object. This leads to the agent and object being in the same case. :Gauza miragarriak ikusi ditut (nik) :thing wonderful-- see- have--- (I-) :I have seen wonderful things. when transformed using the antipassive voice, becomes: :Gauza miragarriak ikusirik nago / ikusia naiz :thing wonderful-- see-- am / see-- am : *I am seen wonderful things Historical origin In Rgyalrong languages, the antipassive prefixes have been shown to derive from denominal derivations.

Early years Bob Jones was the son of William Alexander and Georgia Creel Jones and the eleventh of twelve children. In 1883, when Bob was born, Alex Jones, a Confederate veteran, was working a small farm in Dale County, Alabama, but within months the family moved to Brannon Stand west of Dothan. All the unmarried Jones children helped work the farm there, and Bob Jones often sold the family vegetables door-to-door in Dothan. Jones later recalled, \\"We may have been a little undernourished, but we built some character.\\"Turner, Standing Without Apology, 3 Jones's elementary schooling was limited by modern standards, but the boy early exhibited a quick mind and oratorical ability. Alex Jones had Bob memorize passages from the Bible and from literature, and Bob, who was \\"timid and self- conscious,\\" was regularly called on to perform for guests. Jones later recalled, \\"I did whatever my father said to do, but when he told me to 'say the speech,' I suffered agony that nobody could possibly know.\\"Turner, 6 Jones must have quickly overcome his stage fright, however, for by 1895, as a twelve-year-old, he gave a spirited, twenty-minute defense of the Populist Party while standing on a dry-goods box in front of a Dothan drug store. His gifts were recognized by Dr. Charles Jefferson Hammitt (1858‚Äì1935), a Methodist missionary from Philadelphia and former president of Mallalieu Seminary (1882‚Äì1923), a Methodist secondary school in Kinsey. Jones boarded with the Hammitts and helped pay his board by serving the household, even taking orders from the Hammitt children. Jones graduated from Mallalieu in 1900, and the following year he entered Southern College (later Birmingham- Southern College) at Greensboro, Alabama, supporting himself with his preaching. He attended until 1904 but by then was already so prominent as an evangelist that he left without taking a degree, in part to help support two widowed sisters.Turner, 6-8; Mallalieu Seminary catalog, 1897-98. By the time Jones was 17, both his father and mother were dead. In 1905, Jones married Bernice Sheffield, who contracted tuberculosis and died within ten months of their marriage. On June 17, 1908, he married Mary Gaston Stollenwerck, whom he had met as a choir member during a meeting he was conducting in Uniontown, Alabama. Their only child, Bob Jones, Jr. was born October 19, 1911 in Montgomery, where they made their home. Mary Gaston Jones died on May 12, 1989 in her 101st year‚Äî83 years after the death of her husband's first wife. Evangelistic career Bob Jones and his bride, Mary Gaston Stollenwerck Jones, June 1908Jones's family was devoutly Christian‚Äîhis mother a Primitive Baptist and his father an \\"immersed\\" Methodist. The family attended a nearby Methodist church where Bob Jones was converted at age 11. But as a portent of Jones's later non-denominationalism, he too was baptized by immersion before joining the Methodists. At age 12, Jones was made Sunday School superintendent, and he held his first revival meeting at his home church‚Äîseeing sixty conversions in a single week. At thirteen, he built a \\"brush arbor\\" shelter and organized his own congregation of 54 members. By age 15, Jones was a licensed circuit preacher for the Alabama Methodist Conference. A year later, he was called to the Headland Circuit of five churches, including the one he had started, and he was earning $25 a month (worth $ today) for his labors. Jones later wondered that \\"the devil did not trap me....I was pulled here and there and from house to house. People flocked to hear me preach. The buildings could not hold the crowds; people even stood outside and stuck their heads in the windows to listen. It's a wonder it did not spoil me.\\"Turner, 5-6 American evangelistic meetings received more newspaper publicity at the turn of the twentieth century than before or since and were often boosted by the town fathers out of civic pride. Bob Jones meetings were frequently front-page news for weeks in the cities where he held meetings. By the 1920s, Jones was probably the best-known evangelist in the United States except for Billy Sunday. His campaign results were remarkable even for the era. For instance, in a seven-week campaign in Zanesville, Ohio (1917), a town of 22,000, there were 3,384 converts, of whom 2,200 joined churches on Easter Sunday. In 1921, Muskingum College, a Presbyterian school, became the first of several institutions to confer honorary doctorates on Jones.Johnson, 128 By the time he was 40, Jones had preached to more than fifteen million people face-to-face and without amplification, and he was credited with tens of thousands of conversions. (Unlike Billy Sunday, Jones was reluctant to keep tabulated records of his results.) Crowds might be as large as 15,000 at a time, virtually necessitating the sustained volume, hyperbolic language, and extravagant gestures that became stereotypical characteristics of period evangelists. (In Zanesville, a reporter noted that Jones \\"pounded the altar so hard he broke it.\\")Quoted in Johnson, 95. \\"The custodian replaced the broken top with a thicker board and a pad.\\" Bob Jones University During the Fundamentalist-Modernist controversy of the 1920s, Jones grew increasingly concerned with the secularization of higher education. Children of church members were attending college, only to reject the faith of their parents. Jones later recalled that in 1924, his friend William Jennings Bryan had leaned over to him at a Bible conference service in Winona Lake, Indiana, and said, \\"If schools and colleges do not quit teaching evolution as a fact, we are going to become a nation of atheists.\\"Turner, 19 In the fall of 1925‚Äîshortly after the Scopes Trial‚ÄîJones and his wife were driving in south Florida talking about the need for an orthodox Christian college as an alternative to what he perceived to be loss of both state and denominational colleges to secularism. After stopping for some sandwiches, Jones announced, \\"just as a clap of thunder out of a clear sky,\\" that he was going to found such a school. His wife's first response was, \\"Robert, are you crazy?\\" Jones immediately turned the car north and began consulting with friends in Alabama and north Florida about a location.Johnson and Wright give no date for this event. Turner (23) says it occurred in ‚Äúearly April 1925,‚Äù but as late as August 29, 1925, Jones told an Alabama audience, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt figure out why any man in Covington County would want to sell out and go to Florida. This is the greatest country I know of.‚Äù Andalusia (AL) Daily Star, August 29, 1925, 1. Less than two months later he announced to a crowd in the Methodist church of Panama City, Florida, that he planned to establish an interdenominational college there in Bay County. Panama City Pilot, October 22, 1925, 8. On April 14, 1926, a charter was approved by the circuit court in Panama City, Florida, and Jones promoted real estate sales to raise money for the college. On December 1, 1926, ground was broken on St. Andrews Bay near Lynn Haven, Florida, and the college opened on September 12, 1927 with 88 students. Jones said that although he was averse to naming the school after himself his friends overcame his reluctance \\"with the argument that the school would be called by that name because of my connection with it, and to attempt to give it any other name would confuse the people.\\"Turner, 23-25. In the earliest years of the college, important contributions were made to its stability by J. Floyd Collins and Eunice Hutto. Johnson, 180, 198. Bob Jones took no salary from the college, and in fact, for years afterward, he helped support the school through personal savings and income from his evangelistic campaigns. Both time and place were inauspicious. The Florida land boom had peaked in 1925, and a hurricane in September 1926 further reduced land values. The Great Depression followed hard on its heels. Bob Jones College barely survived bankruptcy and its move to Cleveland, Tennessee in 1933. Nevertheless, the reputation of both the school and its founder continued to grow, and with the enactment of GI Bill at the end of World War II, the college was virtually forced to seek a new location and build a new campus. In 1947, the school moved to Greenville, South Carolina, where it was renamed Bob Jones University.On the move to Greenville see, John A. Matzko, \\"'This Is It, Isn't It, Brother Stone?' The Move of Bob Jones University from Cleveland, Tennessee, to Greenville, 1946-47,\\" South Carolina Historical Magazine, 108 (July 2007), 235-256. By that time, oversight of day-to-day operations had long since passed to his son, Bob Jones, Jr. Nevertheless, the elder Jones continued to raise money, preach regularly at chapel services, and provide inspiration to the hundreds of ministerial students who flooded the campus during the 1950s and revered him as \\"Doctor Bob.\\" Gradually, during the early '60s, he began to suffer \\"hardening of the arteries,\\" resigned as chairman of the board in 1964, and was forced to retire to the University infirmary in 1966. Despite mental confusion, his prayers were said to have remained bell- clear virtually to the end.Turner, 210-11, 320 Radio Broadcasts New mass entertainment, such as radio and movies, helped put an end to an era of citywide evangelism typified by the ministries of Bob Jones and Billy Sunday. But Jones was not afraid of technological progress per se and believed that the new media might provide additional opportunities to spread the gospel. During the early 1920s Jones was one of the first religious figures to broadcast on radio. The 1925 Bob Jones evangelistic meetings in Pittsburgh were perhaps the first remote-controlled religious broadcasts in the world, as well as the first broadcasts to originate from an evangelistic crusade. (In the same year, Jones also made a religious film, which because of its graphic‚Äîfor the era‚Äîportrayal of certain sins, was slashed into an \\"unrecognizable mess\\" by the Pennsylvania State Censorship Board.) In 1927, the year that network radio was launched in the United States, Jones began both a daily and weekly network program heard from New York to Alabama; and despite his other responsibilities, he maintained an uninterrupted radio ministry for 35 years until his health failed in 1962. In 1944, Jones became a founder of National Religious Broadcasters and served as a director. Jones understood that the manner of delivery necessary to declaim to thousands unamplified was unsuited to the new medium, and his radio sermons were instead delivered in an intimate, folksy manner. Perhaps three thousand of his approximately ten thousand radio messages survive, and recordings are still nationally syndicated.BJU website ; Turner, 12, 59 Religious views Home of Bob Jones Sr. from 1948 until his final illness. The two-bedroom house was joined to the larger official residence of the BJU president (at the time Bob Jones, Jr.) to the right of the photo. The exterior has been little altered since Jones's death. Theologically, Jones was a Protestant in the Reformation tradition. One of his first concerns when he founded Bob Jones College was to provide a creed that would embody the fundamentals of the Christian faith. The Bob Jones University creed (composed by journalist and prohibitionist Sam Small) was an abbreviated statement of traditional orthodoxy, emphasizing those aspects of the faith that were under attack during the early twentieth century.\\"I believe in the inspiration of the Bible (both the Old and the New Testaments); the creation of man by the direct act of God; the incarnation and virgin birth of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ; His identification as the Son of God; His vicarious atonement for the sins of mankind by the shedding of His blood on the cross; the resurrection of His body from the tomb; His power to save men from sin; the new birth through the regeneration by the Holy Spirit; and the gift of eternal life by the grace of God.\\" Therefore, the BJC creed affirmed the inspiration of the Bible and rejected the theory of human evolution as necessary tenets of Christian belief. Perhaps because of the tension between his mother‚Äôs Primitive Baptist views and his own long-standing membership in the Methodist Church, Jones sought to split the difference between Calvinism and Arminianism. He urged his hearers to believe that ‚Äúwhatever the Bible says is so,‚Äù even if its words did not fit a particular theological system. Although Jones believed that man was depraved by nature and that salvation was through Christ and by grace alone, his early revival sermons stressed opposition to social sins such as drinking, dancing, and Sabbath desecration and the possibility that they might be ameliorated by legislation as well as by individual repentance.Comments on Here and Hereafter, 61, 91; Johnson, 77-84 Jones's view of academic learning was also practical; he advocated Christian higher education yet insisted that faith could not rest on human argument. Jones was skeptical of both the intellectual emphasis of the Reformed tradition and the pietism of the \\"deeper life\\" movement. He could quote Goethe and Cicero without affectation, but he urged his students to make ‚Äútruth simple and easy to grasp‚Äù‚Äîto put ‚Äúthe fodder on the ground‚Äù and give ‚Äúall the animals from a giraffe to a billy-goat‚Äù an equal chance to understand the gospel.Comments, 54, 123 In the 1950s, Jones played an important, if unwelcome, role in the division of orthodox Protestantism into fundamentalism and neo-evangelicalism. The severance, which had already been bruited about in some conservative seminaries, became actual with the rise to prominence of evangelist Billy Graham. Graham had briefly attended Bob Jones College, and the University had conferred an honorary degree on him in 1948. In the 1940s Jones and Graham seemed to have developed something of a father-son relationship. During the 1950s, however, Graham began distancing himself from the older fundamentalism, and in 1957, he sought broad ecumenical sponsorship for his New York Crusade. Jones argued that because members of Graham‚Äôs campaign executive committee had rejected major tenets of orthodox Christianity, such as the virgin birth and the deity of Christ, Graham had therefore violated 2 John 9-11, which prohibits receiving in fellowship those who do ‚Äúnot abide in the teaching of Christ.‚Äù Members of Graham‚Äôs organization accused Jones of jealousy because Graham was now attracting larger crowds than any who had ever heard Jones. Jones wrote that he was an old man who did not want to ‚Äúget into a battle‚Äù but that he would not go ‚Äúback on the Lord Jesus Christ.‚Äù The notoriety of the Graham-Jones split marked a more-or-less permanent division among Bible-believers into smaller fundamentalist and larger evangelical factions.Turner, 179-83 Political and social views Jones enjoyed politics, was the friend of many politicians, and had been encouraged to run for office a number of times. During the 1928 presidential election, Jones campaigned throughout the South for Republican Herbert Hoover against Democrat Al Smith. Smith, he claimed, would be unduly influenced by the Pope, who Jones said was to Catholics \\"the voice of God.\\"Bob Jones, The Perils of America (1934), a sermon published as a red, paper-bound booklet. Jones said he \\"would rather see a saloon on every corner than a Catholic in the White House.\\" Jones's support for Hoover, though quixotic in 1928, was perhaps the earliest harbinger of the demise of the Solid South. In the late 1920s, Jones, like Billy Sunday (who was an Iowan), accepted contributions for his evangelistic campaigns from the Ku Klux Klan. Jones also supported members of the Klan, notably his friend, Alabama Governor Bibb Graves, for political office. Although Jones rejected lawlessness and lynching, he sympathized with the Klan's professed endorsement of religious orthodoxy, Prohibition, and opposition to the teaching of evolution as fact. Racial segregation per se was hardly an issue among whites in 1920s Alabama because at the time both supporters and a majority of white opponents of the Klan were segregationists.Johnson, 138; Turner, 12. Jones defended Klan positions in the 1920s, but there is no evidence that he ever became a member: ‚Äú‚ÄôI am not a member of the Ku Klux Klan,‚Äô Mr. Jones said, ‚ÄòCol. William J. Simmons, imperial wizard of the klan, a former Methodist preacher, is a close personal friend of mine and he approached me to join the klan. He told me it was a patriotic organization and that it had never been a party to lawlessness. I did not join.‚Äô‚Äù El Paso Times, September 30, 1922, 2. Nevertheless, Jones remained a segregationist into the era of the Civil Rights Movement, when he was in his 70s. There are few references to race in Jones's sermons and chapel messages until the late 1950s, but in a 1960 radio address, Jones declared that God had been the author of segregation and that opposition to segregation was opposition to God.Turner, 225, 369 Jones's health began to fail before the integration of neighboring Furman University in 1965, and he did not live to see the abandonment of segregation, six years later, at Bob Jones University.

He was a player or player-manager for the Chicago White Stockings, Chicago Pirates, Boston Reds, Boston Beaneaters, Milwaukee Brewers and Philadelphia Phillies between 1888 and 1906. He had his best years with the Beaneaters, including the 1894 season, when he set the MLB single-season record for batting average (.440). He also managed the Chicago White Sox and Boston Red Sox and spent several seasons coaching in collegiate baseball and in the minor leagues. Later in life, he spent many years as a scout for the Red Sox. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1945. He worked for Boston until 1953. He died of heart problems the next year. Early life Duffy in 1921 Duffy was born in Cranston, Rhode Island to Irish immigrant Michael Duffy and wife Margaret Duffy. A right-handed batter and thrower, Duffy was listed as tall and . He was a textile mill worker who had taken up baseball as a semipro for weekend diversion.Bill Ferber (2007) A Game of Baseball: The Orioles, The Beaneaters and The Battle For The 1897 Pennant, University of Nebraska Press, , pg. 36 He played a couple years of minor league ball in the New England League before jumping to the majors, starting up in the league's initial season of 1886, and playing on clubs in Hartford, Springfield and Salem, as well as the Lowell, Massachusetts team in 1887.George V. Tuohey (1897) A History of the Boston Base Ball Club, M.F. Quinn & Co, Excerpt, pg. 130 Playing career Duffy entered the National League with Cap Anson's Chicago White Stockings in after receiving an offer of $2,000 from the club. Anson initially was unimpressed with the , 150 pound Duffy, telling him, \\"We already have a batboy.\\"Bill Ferber (2007) A Game of Baseball: The Orioles, The Beaneaters and The Battle For The 1897 Pennant, University of Nebraska Press, , pg. 37 He shortly thereafter earned the reputation of an outstanding outfielder and powerful hitter. Duffy ended up replacing Billy Sunday as the team's regular right fielder. He switched leagues, joining the American Association's Boston Reds in ; he then returned to the NL with the Boston Beaneaters in , where he enjoyed his best seasons. From 1891 through , Duffy knocked in 100 runs or more eight times. In Duffy had one of the greatest seasons in baseball history, leading the league with 18 home runs, with 145 RBI and a .440 batting average (see Major League Baseball Triple Crown). Duffy's .440 average is the major league single-season batting average record.Baseball's Top 100: The Game's Greatest Records, p.26, Kerry Banks, 2010, Greystone Books, Vancouver, BC, At one point during the season, Duffy had a 26-game hitting streak. He was player-manager for the Milwaukee Brewers in 1901. During the 1902 and 1903 seasons, Duffy was player- manager for the Western League's Milwaukee franchise.Louis P. Masur (2003) Autumn Glory: Baseball's First World Series, Hill and Wang, , pg. 98 Duffy was a player-manager for the Phillies from 1904 to 1906. He finished his career in with 106 home runs which was, at the time, one of the highest career totals. Post-playing career Baseball Hall of Fame Duffy spent three years (1907‚Äì1909) as manager of the Providence Grays. He made $2,000 in his last season as the Providence manager and The Evening News in Providence wrote that Duffy was paid hundreds of dollars less than any other manager in the Eastern League. During Duffy's three seasons, Providence finished in third place, second place and third place, respectively. Duffy agreed to manage the Chicago White Sox in 1910. He stayed with the team in 1911. He moved to the Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association in 1912, but he was fired after a season in which the team struggled. He turned down an offer to manage the 1913 St. Paul Saints, saying that he was hoping to work in the east. He coached the Harvard varsity and freshman baseball squads from 1917 through 1919. He also managed the 1920 Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League to a .701 winning percentage‚Äîthe best in the team's 83-year history, but only good enough for second place in the league. In 1921, Duffy was hired as full-time manager of the Red Sox, guiding them for two seasons. Duffy then became a scout for the Red Sox in . Later life Duffy remained on the Red Sox' scouting staff nearly to the end of his life, retiring in . He died in Boston on October 19, 1954. He had been suffering from heart problems. Duffy's wife Nora died the previous year; they did not have children. Posthumously In 2019, Duffy was inducted into the Atlanta Braves Hall of Fame, along with Terry Pendleton.

In the Falklands War, Penelope fired on an Argentine patrol boat and claimed to be the last ship attacked by Argentine aircraft over the course of the war. In 1991, she was commissioned into the Ecuadorean Navy, and renamed Presidente Eloy Alfaro. Background Like other ships of the class, Penelope was named after a figure of mythology. She was launched on 17 August 1962 and commissioned on 31 October 1963. Penelope had originally been intended to be part of the and was to have been named Coventry (and before that Panther), but instead became part of the Leander class. Construction Penelope was laid down at Vickers-Armstrongs' Walker shipyard on Tyneside on 14 March 1961, was launched on 17 August 1962. Penelope was commissioned on 31 October 1963 with the Pennant number F127.Osborne and Sowdon 1990, pp. 32, 109. Total construction cost was ¬£4,600,000.Osborne and Sowdon 1990, p. 36. The ship was long overall and at the waterline, with a beam of and a maximum draught of . Displacement was standard and full load. Two oil-fired boilers fed steam at and to a pair of double reduction geared steam turbines that in turn drove two propeller shafts, with the machinery rated at , giving a speed of .Osborne and Sowdon 1990, p. 111. A twin 4.5-inch (113 mm) Mark 6 gun mount was fitted forward. While the Leander-class was planned to be fitted with the Sea Cat surface-to- air missile, Penelope was completed with two Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft guns as a temporary substitute until Sea Cat could be fitted. A Limbo anti- submarine mortar was fitted aft to provide a short-range anti-submarine capability, while a hangar and helicopter deck allowed a single Westland Wasp helicopter to be operated, for longer range anti-submarine and anti-surface operations.Osborne and Sowdon 1990, pp. 33‚Äì34. As built, Penelope was fitted with a large Type 965 long range air search radar on the ship's mainmast, with a Type 993 short range air/surface target indicating radar and Type 974 navigation radar carried on the ship's foremast. An MRS3 fire control system was carried to direct the 4.5-inch guns.Osborne and Sowden 1990, pp. 33, 35. The ship had a sonar suite of Type 177 medium range search sonar, Type 162 bottom search and Type 170 attack sonar, together with a Type 199 variable depth sonar (VDS). Operational history =1963-1967= After commissioning and workup, Penelope joined the 20th Frigate Squadron which was based at Londonderry Port in Northern Ireland, transferring to the 2nd Frigate Squadron in September 1965.Osborne and Sowdon 1990, p. 37. In 1966 Penelope underwent a refit into a trials ship with much of her weaponry and sensors removed or deactivated. The large Type 965 radar was removed, as was the ship's VDS gear and 40 mm guns, while the twin 4.5-in gun turret and fire-control system was cocooned for preservation.Osborne and Sowdon 1990, pp. 38‚Äì39. She took part in a variety of trials, including tests of different designs of propellers and was refitted in 1970 in preparation for trials of hull noise which involved having her propellers removed and being towed by sister ship at the end of a long cable. She was also fitted with a prototype Type 184M sonar.Osborne and Sowdon 1990, p. 38. =1968= In 1968, Penelope assisted in the aftermath of the Aer Lingus Flight 712 crash in the Irish Sea. There have been a number of conspiracy theories about the crash, including the alleged involvement of Penelope. The theory goes that the ship, while performing tests, mistook the aircraft for a target drone and shot her down. All conspiracy theories have been refuted by the Ministry of Defence, while a 2002 report on the accident by an international study team noted that Penelope was from the site of the accident, and was not fitted with surface to air missiles. =1969-1981= The following year, Penelope was present in West Germany during the Kiel Week festival which combined a yachting race and festival events. In 1973, she underwent another refit to allow her to carry out trials on the Sea Wolf missile. All existing armament was removed, and an experimental tracking system and then a Sea Wolf launcher were mounted on the ship's flight deck. The location of individual trials was dictated by the needs of the scientists conducting the trials. Sometimes live fire trials were conducted within a firing range off the Welsh coast. 4.5 shells fired from a ship several miles away would pass overhead and be targeted by Sea Wolf. Most trials however were conducted in harbour, tied up alongside with the boilers shut down. These trials continued until December 1977, when she started another refit at Devonport Dockyard to return her to an operational frigate and convert her to Batch 2 Exocet configuration.Osborne and Sowdon 1990, pp. 29‚Äì30, 71. =Falklands War= In 1982, Penelope took part in the Falklands War as part of the \\"Bristol group\\", which included two other Leander-class ships - and - she did not reach the Falkland Islands area of operations until 26 May. Upon her arrival, Penelope recovered air-dropped stores. Thereafter she escorted ships to and from the beachhead at San Carlos and Bluff Cove, including, in late May, the damaged which had suffered damage after being hit by cannon fire and bombs. On 13 June, Penelopes Lynx helicopter struck the already stranded Argentinian patrol boat Rio Iguazu with a Sea Skua missile. Penelope also claimed to be the last ship attacked by Argentine aircraft over the course of the war. Penelope returned home in September 1982. Soon after, Penelope undertook a Falklands patrol in the tense aftermath of the war, and did not return home until June 1983. The following year, she deployed to the South Atlantic again, patrolling and performing other duties in that region. =1988= The ship suffered a machinery breakdown and collided with the starboard side of the Canadian Naval supply ship during a replenishment. Penelope caught the Preservers starboard anchor, cutting her port side open. The Canadian vessel suffered $260,000 damage, while Penelope suffered damage estimated in the millions.

Born in Montgomery, Alabama, Jones was the son of Bob Jones Sr., the university's founder. He served as president from 1947 to 1971 and then as chancellor until his death. Education Educated by tutors and at Starke University School in Montgomery, Jones was a voracious reader who tackled everything from Tom Swift and Tarzan to Walter Scott and Foxe's Book of Martyrs. When he was ten years old, his father gave him 50 missionary biographies for Christmas, which the boy finished by February. After graduating from Bob Jones College in 1931, when he was nineteen, Jones earned a master's degree in history at the University of Pittsburgh (1933) and did further graduate work at the University of Chicago Divinity School and Northwestern University. Jones was often called \\"Dr. Bob Jr.\\" during his lifetime, although he disliked the \\"Jr.\\" and his doctorates were honorary, the first conferred by Asbury College in 1934, when he was only twenty-three. Early career As a young man Jones became an accomplished Shakespearean actor and studied at Stratford-upon-Avon. He considered turning professional and even received an offer from Hollywood‚Äîthereby causing some anxious moments for his evangelist father. Jones Jr. did create a one-man show he called \\"Curtain Calls\\", in which he portrayed seven or eight Shakespearean characters accompanied by classical music, scheduling performances four weeks a year from 1933 to 1945.Turner, 129-30. Jones believed that his primary calling was helping his father administer Bob Jones College. Administration per se seems to have held little interest for him; at least his autobiography contains virtually no mention of his college presidency. Nevertheless, Jones seems to have directed the school more autocratically after 1953, when the assistant of Bob Jones Sr., Theodore Mercer, was fired, allegedly for trying to lead a faculty rebellion against the Joneses.Turner says that as president Jones was \\"authoritative and decisive, personally considerate but guarded and somewhat distant and aloof.\\" Turner, 134. In a 2012 Bryan College newspaper article, Mercer's son reported that his father was actually fired for \\"choosing off-campus hospital and doctor attention over medical services provided by the BJU infirmary during his wife‚Äôs pregnancy.\\" \\"T. C. Mercer, from Bob Jones to Bryan,\\" Bryan College Triangle, April 19, 2012. Fundamentalist leader Both Jones's position and his intellectual gifts made him a natural leader of separatist fundamentalism. Although he participated in the founding of the National Association of Evangelicals (NAE) in 1942 and was elected vice president in 1950, Jones left the organization in the following year because of its interest in cultivating a more moderate‚Äîto Jones, \\"compromising\\"‚Äîstance with those who denied biblical orthodoxy. By 1959, Jones had formally broken with Billy Graham, who had accepted the sponsorship of liberal Protestants and Roman Catholics for his 1957 New York City crusade. Later Jones criticized other fundamentalists who were insufficiently separatistic, such as evangelist John R. Rice and Jerry Falwell, whose Moral Majority had embraced Catholics and Mormons. Meanwhile, Jones became a close friend of militant anti-Catholic Ulster Protestant leader Ian Paisley.For Paisley's anti-Catholicism see (as an introduction), a sermon on the errors of the Catholic Church, Part 1. In 1982, when U. S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig refused to grant a travel visa for Paisley to speak at the University's annual Bible Conference, Jones used strong language from the imprecatory Psalms to denounce Haig, urging God to \\"destroy him utterly.\\" The flap was widely reported in the media, and Jones was \\"swamped with vituperative mail\\" until Haig made a serious blunder less than three months later and was forced to leave office, effectively ending his political career.Cornbread and Caviar, 85. For thirteen years Jones edited Faith for the Family (1973‚Äì1986), an issues-oriented fundamentalist periodical that he originated and then eventually discontinued because of its cost. He wrote poetry in traditional forms, including Prologue, a blank-verse drama on the life of John Huss, as well as several hymn texts (set to music by Dwight Gustafson and Joan Pinkston) that are known to a wider fundamentalist community beyond the BJU campus. Art connoisseur Jones was an early connoisseur of European art; he bought his first Russian icon at age thirteen. He began collecting seriously after World War II on a shoe-string budget (about $30,000 a year) authorized by the University Board of Directors. Jones first concentrated on the Italian Baroque, a style then out of favor and relatively inexpensive in the years immediately following the war. Fifty years after the opening of the gallery, the BJU collection included more than 400 European paintings from the 14th to through the 19th centuries (mostly pre-19th century), period furniture, a notable collection of Russian icons, and a hodge-podge of Holy Land antiquities. The Bob Jones University Museum & Gallery, which will indefinitely reflect the personal taste of its creator, is especially strong in Baroque paintings and includes notable works by Rubens, Tintoretto, Veronese, Cranach, Gerard David, Murillo, Mattia Preti, Ribera, van Dyck, and Dor√©. The museum is the largest collection of religious art in the Western Hemisphere and remained Jones' hobby for the remainder of his life.Website of the BJU Museum & Gallery Personal life Jones could be a demanding superior with strong, hyperbolically expressed, views about matters political and religious. But he also could display a childlike humility, especially on his many visits to foreign missionaries. Intimates found him witty and even impish. Although Jones enjoyed playing villains in Shakespeare plays and religious films‚Äîhe founded the BJU cinema department in 1950‚Äîhe genuinely enjoyed a life of ideas and the fine arts.Turner, 134; Johnson, 259. A curator at the North Carolina Museum of Art was genuinely surprised when Jones failed to reflect his preconception as \\"a kind of backwoods evangelical\\" who would \\"thump the Bible\\" at him. \\"There was a gentleness and a kinship there,\\" he recalled. \\"And even if he knew you thought differently than he did, that was OK; you could still be his friend.\\"David Steele in Life and Legacy In 1938, he married Fannie May Holmes. They had three children, including Bob Jones III, who succeeded him as president of BJU. Bob Jones Jr. published two religious novels, several books of sermons, and an autobiography. Jones died of cancer in 1997 at the age of 86; he is buried near his parents on the campus of Bob Jones University. Religious and political views *\\"Pope Paul VI, archpriest of Satan, a deceiver and an anti-Christ, has, like Judas, gone to his own place....[A] pope must be an opportunist, a tyrant, a hypocrite, and a deceiver or he cannot be a pope....A pope claims to be Christ's vice- regent on earth; that is, he blasphemously and arrogantly claims to have the divine prerogatives to forgive sins, to assign his enemies to hell...and to speak on matters of faith and morals with the same infallibility as the Holy Bible.\\" (1978)Faith for the Family (October 1978, 2, 4) *\\"I have grown sick and tired of the 'Praise God' sanctimoniously sighed and the 'Bless the Lord' blasphemously belched forth by the phonies and hypocrites, the deceivers and the deceived who appear on television like the '700 Club' and the 'PTL Club.'...I think the charismatic movement may be more dangerous than all of the other false religions and the cults which we face today.\\" (1985)Cornbread and Caviar, 183 *\\"I have never known it to fail that when five-point Calvinism becomes the chief end of a man's ministry and the most important thing in his preaching, that man becomes cold, dead, egotistical, and a liar.\\"Cornbread and Caviar, 184 *\\"I am inclined to blame every evil on Romanism. Although I dislike everything about the harlot church, the so-called 'Society of Jesus' is the most vicious creation of that religion of darkness and dead bones.\\"Cornbread and Caviar, 43 *On the Kent State shootings (1970):\\"Any students who attack lawfully constituted authority in such a situation should be shot if necessary, and they should expect to be shot.

No senior bureaucrat should be able to retain office longer than eight or ten years, no matter what party is in power, and after twenty years, the people in inferior positions should be retired if they have lasted that long. All Supreme Court justices should be appointed for a limited term of not more than ten years.\\"Cornbread and Caviar, 206 *On Billy Graham (1985): \\"For a long time I believed that Billy was doing more harm than any other living man. What a tragedy to see him building the church of Antichrist, masking the wickedness of popery, and providing a sheep's cloak of Christian recognition for the wolves of apostasy.\\"Cornbread and Caviar, 159 *\\"Religiously, I think perhaps the silliest idea abroad‚Äîand one which is calculated to divide the people of God‚Äîis the idea that there is some sort of special inspiration attached to the...King James Version....Moreover, it is a heresy because it implies that God did not completely inspire the original manuscripts and therefore in 1611 He had to add inspiration.\\"Cornbread and Caviar, 179 *\\"I knew, as a boy, some devout and earnest black preachers of the Word of God. There were many. Today I know of very few and am personally acquainted with only two or three black preachers in this country who emphasize the Scripture, stress the necessity of the new birth, and are in any degree biblical in their convictions or their preaching. It is small wonder then that we are seeing a whole new generation of blacks come up in America who have little moral conviction.\\" (1985)Cornbread and Caviar, 182 *\\"I have no brief for Oral Roberts, whom I regard as one of the biggest religious phonies in America today.\\"Cornbread and Caviar, 200 *\\"In not seeking public approval or attempting to 'build a following,' no doubt I have sometimes not been careful enough about trying to be tactful, discreet, and wise in dealing with the public. I certainly have never tried to avoid meeting an issue head-on, and I have always been honest and frank in my public statements. This may not be the most politic course of action, but then I have never had a politician's ambition.\\"Cornbread and Caviar, 198 *After preaching in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Jones was bearded by a \\"big, burly Dutch missionary\\" who said, \\"I hear at Bob Jones University you do not like black people. I hear your rules are too strict and that there is no love there.\\" Jones interrupted, \\"I hear that Dutch Calvinists are rude and disagreeable, insulting, and thoroughly abrasive; that their lives are carnal; and that they have no conscience against drinking and smoking and little concern for the winning of souls.\\" When the missionary was sufficiently taken aback, Jones added that he didn't necessarily believe everything he heard.Cornbread and Caviar, 188 Writings *As the Small Rain, (Zondervan, 1945) sermon collection *Cornbread and Caviar: Reminiscences and Reflections, (BJU Press, 1985) *Daniel of Babylon: A Novel, (BJU Press, 1984) *How to Improve Your Preaching, (BJU Press, 1960) *Rhyme & Reason, (BJU Press, 1981) an anthology of inspirational verse *Showers Upon the Grass, (Zondervan, 1951) sermon collection *Wine of Morning: A Novel of the First Century (1950) reprint, BJU Press, 1976 References * Daniel L.

The son of Bob Jones Jr., and the grandson of Bob Jones Sr., the university's founder, Jones served as president of BJU from 1971 to 2005. Biography Jones was born in Cleveland, Tennessee, the son of Fannie May (Holmes) and Bob Jones, Jr. Jones moved with his family to Greenville, South Carolina, in 1947 when Bob Jones College built a new campus and became Bob Jones University.Greenville News, January 3, 2004 Because his father was a connoisseur of the arts, Jones III early visited Europe and the Levant on his father's summer tours. As a teenager he was given minor roles in campus Shakespeare performances and a major role in the film version of his father's novel Wine of Morning. Likewise, as the son and grandson of well-known fundamentalists, Jones III met many politicians and notable preachers in his youth. At fifteen, his father rusticated him to a summer camp sponsored by Ernest Reveal, a BJU board member and the founder of the Evansville Rescue Mission, where Jones preached and otherwise participated in the camp's evangelistic ministry to lower-class children from the Evansville area. Jones credited this experience with having had a significant impact on his later career. Jones completed his bachelor of arts (1959) and master of arts (1961) in speech from Bob Jones University and took additional courses in speech and drama at Northwestern University and New York University. He also received honorary degrees from two small Bible schools and a seminary. Although less intellectually gifted than his father, Jones III did excel academically. Unlike his father, though, Jones III also developed an interest in athletics‚Äîbasketball as a young man, and later skiing, hunting and other outdoor sports. He enjoyed flying and even considered a military career. Nevertheless, by the end of his undergraduate years, Jones believed that he had been called to \\"help perpetuate the ideals and standards\\" of the school that his grandfather had founded. He served as a teaching assistant in the speech department and then as a dormitory supervisor. Between 1961 and 1971, his father provided a growing administrative role in the University, including preaching for campus services. He also accepted an increasing number of off- campus speaking invitations. Unlike his father, Jones III became genuinely interested in the mechanics of university administration, although his training for his college presidency was, like his father's, informal at best. To help with business judgments, Jones eventually appointed a personal friend and former businessman, Bob Wood, as vice president. Rather shy and \\"reticent to initiate conversations with strangers\\", Jones was also a highly competitive, 'Type A' personality, who regularly worked sixteen hours a day during his presidency.Turner, 220; Steve Skaggs, \\"A Link in the Chain: The Soulwinning Heart of Dr. Bob III: An Interview,\\" Voice of the Alumni, 80 (Spring 2007), 6. \\"Witnessing has never been easy for me.

Pettit as Fifth President of Bob Jones University\\" . Jones inherited the presidency of Bob Jones University as its enrollment continued to climb but also as the school began to face the opposition of the federal government to its racial policies. During the early 1980s, Jones was frequently interviewed by the media, and he presented the position of the University‚Äîas a matter of First Amendment rights‚Äîto the best of his considerable ability. Nevertheless, Jones had difficulty finding a route of escape from the positions on race that had been adopted by his predecessors during the period of segregation in the early twentieth-century South and which he himself had endorsed in his youth. Until her death in 2019, Jones was married to Beneth Peters Jones, an author and seminar speaker, whom he had gotten to know when she played Roxane to his Christian in a campus performance of Cyrano de Bergerac. They had three children. In March 2020, he married Karen Rowe, a member of the BJU English faculty.https://today.bju.edu/president/god-directed-dr-bob-jones-iii-remarry/ Jones's younger son, Stephen, replaced him as president of BJU in May 2005 when Jones III took the title, \\"Chancellor.\\" Jones III remains chairman of the International Testimony to an Infallible Bible and chairman of the board of directors of the Bob Jones University Museum & Gallery.

She was then transferred to the Greek Navy and renamed Themistoklis (D-210). The ship was decommissioned in 1992 and finally sunk as a target in 2001. History =1944-1971= Frank Knox was built at Bath, Maine and was named after Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox. Commissioned in December 1944, she arrived in the western Pacific war zone in mid-June 1945, in time to participate in the final carrier air raids on the Japanese home islands as part of Task Force 38. During the Battle of Okinawa she acted as a radar picket destroyer giving early warnings of incoming air raids. She was present in Tokyo Bay when Japan formally surrendered on 2 September 1945 and remained in the Far East until early February 1946. The ship made additional deployments to the region during the later 1940s and was reclassified as a radar picket destroyer DDR-742, in March 1949. Frank Knox aground on Pratas Reef, in 1965. Frank Knox again steamed across the Pacific to take part in hostilities in early July 1950, shortly after the outbreak of the Korean War. During this combat tour, which lasted into 1951, her missions included support of the Inchon invasion, shelling enemy targets ashore and patrolling the Taiwan Straits. Two more Korean War cruises followed in 1952 and 1953, and for the rest of the decade Frank Knox deployed regularly to WestPac for Seventh Fleet service. In 1960-1961 Frank Knox was modernized under the FRAM II program, which gave her updated radars and other new equipment. She was based in the Far East from late 1961 until mid-1964, then returned home via Australia and the south Pacific. Again deployed in June 1965, she briefly served off Vietnam conducting naval gunfire support and coastal patrol operations. While underway in the South China Sea on 18 July, Frank Knox ran aground on Pratas Reef, and was only freed after a very difficult salvage effort. Though she was badly damaged, and relatively elderly, her command and control capabilities justified an extensive repair job, which was carried out at Yokosuka, Japan, over the next year. Frank Knox rejoined the active forces in November 1966 and resumed her pattern of nearly annual Seventh Fleet cruises, frequently taking part in Vietnam combat missions. Redesignated DD-742 at the beginning of 1969, she completed her final deployment in November 1970 and was decommissioned at the end of January 1971. =Greek service= USS Frank Knox was transferred to the Greek Navy a few days later. Renamed Themistoklis (D210) (from Themistocles Athenian statesman who persuaded Athens to build a navy and then led it to victory over the Persians), she served for another two decades before being placed out of commission in the early 1990s.

It was reformed on 12 April 2013 at Edwards Air Force Base, California, as the Operational Evaluation Unit (OEU) for the Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning. History =First World War= A Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2c, much like what No. 17 Squadron operated from 1915 to 1918. No. 17 Squadron formed for the first time on 1 February 1915 at Gosport as part of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC). It was first equipped with the Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2c. After an initial training period, the Squadron embarked for Egypt in November and arrived on 11 December. On 24 December, the Squadron made its first reconnaissance flight over the Turkish lines in Sinai, also flying in support of troops engaged with Turkish army units in the Western Desert. Detachments were also to be found in Arabia until July 1916, when the Squadron was sent to Salonika as a mixed unit of twelve B.E.2cs for reconnaissance and a scout component of two Airco D.H.2s and three Bristol Scouts. At first it was the only RFC unit in Macedonia but was later joined by others in April 1918, handing over its fighters to a newly formed No. 150 Squadron. For the rest of the war, it was engaged in tactical reconnaissance and artillery spotting on the Bulgarian border. Throughout the war, No. 17 Squadron claimed 26 aerial victories, and had two flying aces, future Air Marshal Sir Gerald Gibbs (RAF officer) and Gilbert W. M. Green, within its ranks. =Interwar years= In December 1918, the Squadron re-equipped with twelve Airco D.H.9s and six Sopwith Camels, sending 'A Flight' to Batum to support the White Russian forces and 'B' and 'C Flights' to Constantinople in January 1919. On 14 November 1919, No. 17 Squadron was disbanded. The Squadron reformed at RAF Hawkinge on 1 April 1924 and was equipped with Sopwith Snipes. From this time No. 17 Squadron formed part of the fighter defence of the UK until the outbreak of the Second World War. The Squadron converted to the Hawker Woodcock in March 1926, one of only two squadrons to operate it - the other being No. 3 Squadron. In June 1927 a Woodcock from No. 17 Squadron was borrowed by the pilot of the Spirit of St. Louis, Charles Lindbergh, who flew it from London to Paris shortly after his transatlantic flight. In January 1928, the Squadron converted over to the Gloster Gamecock, these were only kept until September when they were exchanged for Armstrong Whitworth Siskins.Thetford, Owen. \\"On Silver Wings ‚Äî Part 6\\". Aeroplane Monthly, March 1991, Vol 19 No 3, Issue 215, pp. 138‚Äì144. London: IPC. ISSN 0143-7240. A Bristol Bulldog, similar to what No. 17 Squadron operated from 1929 to 1936. No. 17 Squadron then equipped with Bristol Bulldog Mk.IIs in October 1929, these would be kept up until August 1936. However, during the Abyssinian Crisis in 1935, the Squadron lost most of its Bulldogs as reinforcements for other squadrons moving to the Middle East and so had to fly Hawker Harts for a period. No. 17 Squadron were equipped with Gloster Gauntlets in August 1936. It was in recognition of these aircraft that the Squadron got its badge design, which was officially approved by Edward VIII in October 1936. The Squadron received its first monoplane, the Hawker Hurricane Mk.I, in June 1939. =Second World War= No. 17 Squadron flew defensive patrols from numerous bases in Britain, including RAF Debden and RAF Martlesham Heath, until the German attack on France in May 1940. Once the Phony War was over, fighter sweeps were then flown over the Netherlands, Belgium and French airfields to cover the retreat of allied troops. In June 1940, the Squadron moved to Brittany as the remnants of BEF and RAF units in France were evacuated, retiring to the Channel Islands for two days before returning to the UK. No. 17 Squadron flew over southern England throughout the Battle of Britain. The Squadron briefly upgraded to Hurricane Mk.IIas in February 1941 however they shortly reverted to Hurricane Mk.Is in April. No. 17 Squadron moved up to RAF Castletown in northern Scotland on 5 April for rest. In July 1941 the Squadron again upgraded its Hurricanes, this time to Mk.IIbs. On 11 November 1941, the Squadron sailed for the Far East where war broke out on 7 December. Diverted to Burma, it arrived in January 1942, as Japanese troops neared Rangoon. Defensive patrols were flown until the Rangoon airfields were overrun and No. 17 Squadron moved north, eventually being cut off from India while operating from Lashio. The surviving aircraft were flown out and the ground personnel made their way across Burma to the Indian border. By the end of May, the Squadron had re-assembled at Calcutta and in June received aircraft again for the defence of the area. In August 1942, No. 17 Squadron upgraded to Hurricane Mk.IIcs. Ground attack missions began in February 1943 and continued until August, when the Squadron moved to Ceylon. Supermarine Spitfire Mk.VIIIs began to arrive in March 1944 and were taken back to the Burma front in November to fly escort and ground attack missions. In June 1945, No. 17 Squadron upgraded to Spitfire Mk.XIVes. The Squadron was withdrawn from Burma to prepare for the invasion of Malaya. However, due to the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, they were simply taken by the carrier HMS Trumpeter to the landing beaches near Penang in early September, soon after the Japanese capitulation. =Post-War= Cold War No. 17 Squadron SEPECAT Jaguar GR.1 XX768 at RAF Br√ºggen, 1982. In April 1946, No. 17 Squadron arrived in Japan to form part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. The squadron remained here until it disbanded on 23 February 1948. However it shortly returned to existence on 11 February 1949 at RAF Chivenor when No. 691 Squadron was renumbered as No. 17 Squadron. The Squadron adopted No. 691 Squadron's role of being an anti-aircraft co-operation unit. During this time the Squadron flew a mixture of aircraft including the Spitfire LF.XVIe and target tugs: Airspeed Oxford T.II; Miles Martinet TT.I; North American Harvard TT.IIb; Bristol Beaufighter TT.X. No. 17 Squadron continued this role until it disbanded once again on 13 March 1951. The Squadron reformed at RAF Wahn in West Germany on 1 June 1956. This time it operated English Electric Canberra PR.7s, thus carrying out the photo reconnaissance role. The Squadron moved to RAF Wildenrath in April 1957 and flew from here before standing down on 31 December 1969. It stood up once more on 1 September 1970 at RAF Br√ºggen, this time flying the new McDonnell Douglas Phantom FGR.2, in a ground attack role. They were also assigned to SACEUR from which the Phantoms held a tactical nuclear strike role, carrying American supplied nuclear weapons. In September 1975, the Squadron began to convert over to the SEPECAT Jaguar GR.1. No. 17 Squadron were fully re-equipped with twelve Jaguar GR.1s by 31 January 1976. These continued the nuclear strike role from the Phantoms, being assigned to SACEUR, but this time carrying the British WE.177 nuclear weapon, a role they kept until 1984. Their task was to support land forces in a high-intensity European war using conventional weapons initially, and tactical nuclear weapons if a conflict escalated. Some aircraft were to be held back in reserve from the conventional phase to ensure that sufficient aircraft survived the conventional phase to deliver the squadron's full stock of eight nuclear weapons. Still at RAF Br√ºggen, No. 17 Squadron began to convert to the Panavia Tornado GR.1 in January 1985. They reached full strength of twelve aircraft by 1 March when the last Jaguars were disbanded. The Squadron at this time also had eighteen WE.177 nuclear bombs, and although the squadron's role remained unchanged, their Tornado aircraft were each able to carry two WE.177 bombs, with the ratio of weapons to aircraft at full strength increasing to 1.5 : 1.RAF nuclear front line Order-of-Battle 1985 Operation Granby A Panavia Tornado GR.1, much like No. 17 Squadron operated from 1985 to 1999, as well as during Operation Granby. During the First Gulf War in 1991, No. 17 Squadron was deployed to Muharraq Airfield in Bahrain, and also had crew sent to Dhahran Airfield. At Muharraq, its twelve Tornado GR.1s were split between three flight lines ‚Äì 'Snoopy AirWays', 'Triffid Airways' and 'Gulf Airways'. Tornado operations, as part of Op GRANBY, began on 17 January 1991 to assert air superiority over Iraq. The Squadron suffered a loss on 24 January when a Tornado GR.1 (ZA403) was rocked by an explosion forcing the pilot (Fg. Off. S. J. Burgess) and navigator (Sqn Ldr R. Ankerson) to eject. Both crew members were captured and were kept as prisoners of war (PoWs) until the end of conflict. An investigation after the war of the wreckage and flight recorder deduced that one of the 1,000lb bombs dropped had detonated prematurely thus causing extensive damage to the Tornado. No. 17 Squadron suffered its second loss on 14 February when a Tornado GR.1 (ZD717) carrying out laser-guided bomb attacks on an Iraqi airfield was forced down by two Iraqi SAMs which exploded in close proximity to the aircraft. The pilot (Flt. Lt. R. J. Clark) initiated ejection for himself and his navigator (Flt. Lt. S. M. Hicks). On landing Clark was captured by Iraqi forces and was held as a PoW for the rest of the war, it was only after his capture that he learned his navigator Hicks had been killed in the attack. Tornados to Typhoons Returning to RAF Br√ºggen, No. 17 Squadron continued its nuclear strike role up until the retirement of the WE.177, with it finally relinquishing its nuclear delivery capability fully in 1998. With the end of the Cold War and the reunification of Germany, the RAF planned to reduce its presence in Germany by half, and by 1996 a final decision was made to withdraw the entire RAF presence from the country. Due to the Strategic Defence Review of 1998, it was decided to withdraw two RAF squadrons, one of which was No. 17 Squadron. The Squadron and its Tornado GR.1s disbanded on 31 March 1999, ending almost 30 years at RAF Br√ºggen. The Squadron was reformed on 1 September 2002 as No. XVII (Reserve) Squadron at BAE Systems's Warton Aerodrome. At Warton, a special facility had been constructed to specially operate the new Eurofighter Typhoon T.1s and F.2s. No. 17 (R) Squadron was tasked with being the Operational Evaluation Unit (OEU), or alternatively the Typhoon Operational Evaluation Unit (TOEU), for the type, becoming the first in the RAF to operate it. The Squadron relocated to RAF Coningsby on 1 April 2005 and was officially re-formed at its new base on 19 May 2005. With the Typhoon fully operational, the need for the separate OEU ended and so the Squadron was disbanded on 12 April 2013. Its functions were taken over by the RAF's Test and Evaluation Squadron, No. 41 (R) Squadron. =Modern day= F-35B Lightning Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightnings of No. 17 Test and Evaluation Squadron aboard HMS Queen Elizabeth, October 2019. The Squadron stood up at Edwards AFB, California, on 12 April 2013 as a joint RAF/Royal Navy Test and Evaluation Squadron for the new Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning. In January 2014, it became the first UK, and RAF, squadron to operate the F-35B Lightning, with BK-1 (ZM135) being the first British aircraft. In February 2015, the Squadron celebrated its centenary at Edwards AFB. No. 17 (R) Squadron is currently made up of half RAF/RN personnel, as well as training personnel for No. 617 Squadron and No. 207 Squadron; the second and third RAF squadrons to operate the F-35B in 2018 and 2019. Equipped with 3 F-35B aircraft (ZM135, ZM136 and ZM138), it continues to be the first UK Lightning squadron and is tasked with full-time operational test and evaluation of the F-35B, required to bring the aircraft and its weapons into UK service. It operates within the Joint Operational Test Team for F-35 at Edwards AFB, flying operational test sorties alongside all variants from the US Air Force, US Navy, US Marine Corps and Royal Netherlands Air Force, as part of the UK Partnership within the F-35 program. It's currently embedded with the 461st Flight Test Squadron of the United States Air Force. No. 17 (Reserve) Test and Evaluation Squadron lost its (Reserve) suffix on 1 February 2018 when the (Reserve) nameplate was rescinded across the entire RAF, thus becoming No. 17 Test and Evaluation Squadron. No. 17 TES embarked their three F-35Bs upon HMS Queen Elizabeth on 13 October 2019 as part of Westlant 19, becoming the first British jets to land on the carrier.

It recounts the lives of Adam and Eve from after their expulsion from the Garden of Eden to their deaths. It provides more detail about the Fall of Man, including Eve's version of the story. Satan explains that he rebelled when God commanded him to bow down to Adam. After Adam dies, he and all his descendants are promised a resurrection. The ancient versions of the Life of Adam and Eve are: the Greek Apocalypse of Moses, the Latin Life of Adam and Eve, the Slavonic Life of Adam and Eve, the Armenian Penitence of Adam, the Georgian Book of Adam,French Translation: J.P. Mah√© Le Livre d'Adam g√©orgienne de la Vita Adae in Studies in Gnosticism and Hellenistic Religions, ed. R. van den Broek and M. J. Vermaseren. Leiden 1981 and one or two fragmentary Coptic versions. These texts are usually named as Primary Adam Literature to distinguish them from subsequent related texts, such as the Cave of Treasures that includes what appears to be extracts. They differ greatly in length and wording, but for the most part appear to be derived from a single source that has not survived, Each version contains some unique material, as well as variations and omissions. While the surviving versions were composed from the early 3rd to the 5th century CE, the literary units in the work are considered to be older and predominantly of Jewish origin. There is wide agreement that the original was composed in a Semitic language in the 1st century CE.  Themes  \\"The Expulsion of Adam and Eve from Eden\\" picture from (Small Bible with pictures) by P√©ter Koll√°r (1897). The main theological issue in these texts is that of the consequences of the Fall of Man, of which sickness and death are mentioned. Other themes include the exaltation of Adam in the Garden, the fall of Satan, the anointing with the oil of the Tree of Life, and a combination of majesty and anthropomorphism in the figure of God, involving numerous merkabahs and other details that show a relationship with 2 Enoch. The idea of resurrection of the dead is present and Adam is told God's son Christ will come at that time to anoint all who believe in him with the Oil of Mercy, a fact that has led many scholars to think part of the text is of Christian origin. The Life of Adam and Eve is also important in the study of the early Seth traditions.A. Frederik, J. Klijn Seth in Jewish, Christian and Gnostic Literature (1977) pag 16ff Interesting parallels can be found with some New Testament passages, such as the mention of the Tree of Life in . The more striking resemblances are with ideas in the Second Epistle to the Corinthians: Eve as the source of sin (), Satan disguising himself as an angel of light (), the location of the paradise in the third heaven (). In addition, there are parallels between Christ's forty days in the desert and Adam and Eve's forty days in the rivers. No direct relationship can be determined between the New Testament and the Life of Adam and Eve, but the similarities suggest that Paul the Apostle and the author of 2 Enoch were near contemporaries of the original author of this work and moved in the same circle of ideas.J.H. Charlesworth the Old Testament Pseudepigrapha Vol 2 (1985) pag 255 The theme of death is also central to the text. While Adam is dying, Seth asks what it means to be ill, as he has no concept of it. Adam must explain to his children what dying and death means, and what to do with his body when he dies.  Greek Apocalypse of Moses  The Apocalypse of Moses (literally, the Revelation of Moses) is the usual name for the Greek version of the Life of Adam and Eve. This title was given to it by Tischendorf,Tischendorf C., Apocalypses Apocryphae, Leipzig 1866 (reprint Hildesheim 1966) its first editor, and taken up by others.name used also by Robert Henry Charles in his translation: Pseudepigrapha of the Old Testament, vol. 2. Oxford: Clarendon, 1913 In the text, Moses is referred to only in the first sentence as the prophet to whom the story was revealed. The Greek Apocalypse of Moses (not to be confused with the Assumption of Moses) is usually considered to predate the Latin Life of Adam and Eve. Tischendorf used four manuscripts for his edition: manuscripts A,Marc. graec II 42 of Biblioteca Marciana of Venice, of the 13th century, which includes chapters 1‚Äì36, B,Vindobonensis Theol. Graec. 247, Wien C, and D.codex graecus C 237 Inf of Biblioteca Ambrosiana During the 20th century many other manuscripts have been found, of which E1Bibl. Nat. Fonds grec 1313, Paris and E2, which are similar to the Armenian version, merit special mention. = Content = * After being banished from the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve go to the East and live there for eighteen years and two months. Eve gives birth to Cain and Abel. Eve dreams that Cain drinks the blood of Abel, but that it then came out of his mouth. Cain kills Abel. Michael promises to Adam a new son, and Seth is born in place of Abel. (chapters 1‚Äì4) * Adam begets 30 other sons and 30 daughters. As Adam falls sick and is in pain, all his sons and daughters come to him, and he briefly recounts to them the story of the Fall. Seth and Eve travel to the doors of the Garden to beg for some oil of the tree of mercy (i.e. the Tree of Life). On the way Seth is attacked and bitten by a wild beast, which goes away when ordered by Seth. Michael refuses to give them the oil at that time, but promises to give it at the end of time, when all flesh will be raised up, the delights of paradise will be given to the holy people and God will be in their midst. On their return, Adam says to Eve: \\"What hast thou done? Thou hast brought upon us great wrath which is death.\\" (chapters 5‚Äì14) * Eve recounts to her sons and daughters the story of the Fall from her point of view: ** In the Garden, she is separated from Adam: she stays with the female animals and Adam with the male ones. The devil persuades the male snake to rebel against Adam and his wife: at the hour the angels go up to worship the Lord, Satan disguises himself as an angel and speaks to Eve using the mouth of the serpent. The serpent seduces Eve, who swears to give the fruit to eat to Adam too. The serpent places in the fruit the poison of his wickedness, which is lust. When Eve eats it, she discovers that she is naked. All the trees of the Garden lose their leaves. Only a fig tree, the plant she ate of, still has leaves, and she hides her shame with its leaves. Eve looks for Adam and deceives him: he also eats the forbidden fruit. (chapters 15‚Äì21) **Michael sounds a trumpet, and God enters the Garden mounted on the chariot of his Cherubim and preceded by the angels. His throne is set where the Tree of Life is, and all the trees break out in blossoms. He calls Adam, who hid because he was naked, and reproaches Adam, Eve and the serpent (the order of the reproaches is the opposite to that of Genesis). When the angels are casting Adam out of paradise, he asks to be allowed to implore God, saying: \\"For I alone have sinned.\\" He begs God to be allowed to eat of the Tree of Life. God refuses to give him the fruit of immortality, but promises, if Adam will keep from all evil, to raise him up in the last day and give him the fruit. Before being cast out, Adam is allowed to take sweet spices (to offer sacrifices) and seeds for his food. (chapters 22‚Äì30) * Adam lies sick and foretells that Eve will die shortly after. He asks Eve to pray, because they do not know whether God is angry with them or merciful. While Eve is praying on bended knee, the angel of humanity (probably Michael) comes and shows her the spirit of Adam gone from his body and ascending to God. (chapters 31‚Äì32) * Chapters 33‚Äì41 narrate, with great richness of liturgical detail, the funeral of Adam. **A chariot of light, borne by four bright eagles with Seraphim and angels, arrives where Adam's body lies. The seven heavens are opened and Seth explains to his mother who are the two fearful figures in mourning: the sun and the moon, deprived of their light, because God is present. God has mercy on Adam, who is cleansed three times in water before being carried before God. God stretches out his arm, and hands Adam over to Michael to be carried to the third heaven until the last day. (chapters 33‚Äì37) ** The chariot and all the angels bear Adam's body to the Garden and lay him on the earth. Only Seth can see the scene. The body is covered with linen clothes and fragrant oil is poured on it. The body of Abel also, which until then the earth had refused to receive, is taken to the same place. Both bodies are buried in the place from which God took the clay to create Adam. God calls Adam, whose body answers from the earth. God promises Adam that he and everyone of his seed will rise again. (chapters 38‚Äì41) * Six days later, Eve asks to be buried near Adam and dies praying to the Lord. Three angels bury Eve near Adam, and Michael tells Seth never to mourn on the Sabbath. (chapters 42‚Äì43)  Latin Life of Adam and Eve  The main edition of this Latin version (in Latin Vita Adami et Evae) is that of W. Meyer in 1878Vita Adae et Evae, in Abhandl. der kon.bayer.Akademie der Wissenschaften Philos-philol Klasse XIV, 3 Munich 1878 based on manuscripts S, T, M of the 9th, 10th, and 12th centuries. Later, a new and extended edition was prepared by MozleyJ.H.Mozley the Vita Adae in Journal of Theological Studies, 30, 1929 based mainly on manuscripts kept in England, of which the most important is manuscript A.Arundel 326, 14th century = Content = The story begins immediately after Adam and Eve's banishment from the Garden of Eden and continues to their deaths. * After being banished from the Garden of Eden, they go to the West and after six days they become hungry, but the only food they find is that for animals. They decide to do penance in order to ask mercy to the Lord and to return in the Garden. Adam explains to Eve how to do penance: he will stay forty-seven days immersed in the Jordan and Eve forty days in the icy Tigris. Adam enters in the Jordan and prays the Lord together with all the creatures of the river. (chapters 1‚Äì8)chapters numeration is according to Mozley's edition, longer than Charles' published text * Satan disguises himself as a bright angel and talks her out of it. Eve returns to Adam, who reproaches her. Eve lies prostrate with grief. Adam complains about Satan persecuting them, and Satan explains that he and his followers refused God's command to worship both Adam, the image of the God, and God himself. Thus Satan with his angels were expelled from heaven, deprived of their glory and began to envy men. Adam, unaffected by the story, serves forty days of penance in the Jordan. (chapters 9‚Äì17) * Eve is so grief- stricken that she leaves Adam and goes alone toward the West, lamenting and crying. When it is the time for her to give birth, she is alone. Adam reaches her and prays the Lord: because of his prayer many angels arrive to help her in the delivery: Cain is born and immediately is able to run. They return east. Michael is sent by the Lord to teach Adam agriculture. (chapters 18‚Äì22) * Abel is born. Eve dreams that Cain drinks the blood of Abel. Adam and Eve make Cain a husbandman and Abel a shepherd in order to separate them from each other. But Cain murders Abel (there is no trace of the common story found elsewhere that Cain and Abel had twin sisters, and Cain's killing of Abel is passed over quickly). Seth is born in place of Abel, along with 30 other sons and 30 (or 32) daughters. (chapters 23‚Äì24). The Forgotten Books of Eden: The First Book of Adam and Eve: Chapter LXXIV:5‚Äì10; page 58 Cain and his twin sister Luluwa is born and Chapter LXXV:11; page 59 Abel and his twin sister Aklia is born. The Forgotten Books of Eden: The Second Book of Adam and Eve: Chapter 2:8 \\"As for Adam, he knew not again his wife Eve, all the days of his life; neither was any more offspring born of them; but only those five, Cain, Luluwa, Abel, Aklia,\\" and Seth alone. Josephus in endnotes 8) \\"The number of Adam's children, as says the old tradition was thirty-three(33) sons, and twenty-three(23) daughters.\\" * Adam recounts to Seth that, after the Fall, he was caught up into the Paradise of righteousness and saw a chariot with the Lord seated on it among angels (a merkabah). Adam worshipped the Lord, who promised him that knowledge will not be taken away from Adam's seed for ever. Adam continues to recount briefly to Seth the history of the world up to last judgment (the Second Temple period is marked as a time of iniquity but the destruction of the Temple is not recounted). (chapters 25‚Äì29) * As Adam is dying, sick and in pain, he wants to bless all his sons and daughters, who do not know what illness and pain are. Adam recounts to them the story of the Fall. Seth and Eve travel to the gates of the Garden to beg for some oil of the Tree of Life. On the way Seth is attacked and bitten by the Serpent, which goes away when ordered by Seth. At the gates of the Garden Michael refuses to give them the oil. On their return, Adam says to Eve: \\"What hast thou done? A great plague hast thou brought upon us, transgression and sin for all our generations.\\" (chapters 30‚Äì44) * Adam dies at the age of 930 and the sun, the moon and the stars are darkened for seven days. Adam's soul is consigned to Michael till the day of Judgment, when his sorrow will be converted into joy. God and some angels bury his body and Abel's. (chapters 45‚Äì49) * Eve perceives that she will die and assembles all her sons and daughters for her testament, predicting a double judgment of water (probably the deluge) and fire. Seth is charged to write on two tablets the life of his parents. (chapters 49‚Äì50) * Six days later, Eve dies, and Michael tells Seth never to mourn on the Sabbath. (chapters 51) * Chapters 52‚Äì57chapters 52‚Äì57 are not included in Mayer's edition but are included in Mozley's edition include various additional traditions: the tablets written by Seth about the lives of his parents are put in the place where Adam used to pray, that is Temple Mount. Only Salomon could read them. The entry of Adam into the Garden only forty days after his creation (eighty for Eve). The explanation of the eight parts of Adam's body and the origin of the name Adam. Only the plot of chapters 23‚Äì24, 30‚Äì49, 51 is in common with that of the Apocalypse of Moses, though with great differences in details. Chapters 15‚Äì30 (Eve's Tale) of the Apocalypse of Moses have no parallel in the Latin Life of Adam and Eve. The penance of Adam and Eve in the water can be found also in the later Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan.  Slavonic Life of Adam and Eve  The Slavonic Adam book was published by Jagic along with a Latin translation in 1893.Denkschr. d. Wien. Akad. d. Wiss. xlii., 1893 This version agrees for the most part with the Greek Apocalypse of Moses. It has, moreover, a section, ¬ß¬ß 28‚Äì39, which, though not found in the Greek text, is found in the Latin Life of Adam and Eve. It includes also some unique material.  Armenian Penitence of Adam  This Armenian version of the Life of Adam and Eve was first published in 1981 by StoneM.E. Stone The Penitence of Adam CSCSO 429-30, Louvain (1981). and is based on three manuscripts.Jerusalem, Armenian Patriarchate, No. 1458 pp. 380‚Äì431 17th century, No. 1370 pp. 127‚Äì150 17th century and Erevan, Matenadaran, No. 3461 fols. 66r-87v dated 1662 It was probably translated into Armenian from Greek and takes its place alongside the Greek and Latin versions as a major witness to the Adam book. A different book is the Armenian Book of Adam,published by the Mechitharist community in Venice in their Collection of Uncanonical Writings of the Old Testament, and translated by F. C. Conybeare (Jewish Quarterly Review, vii. 216 sqq., 1895), and by Issaverdens in 1901. which closely follows the text of the Apocalypse of Moses. The content of the Armenian Penitence of Adam includes both the penances in the rivers (not found in the Greek version) and Eve's recounting of the Fall (not found in the Latin version).  Archive  The Adam and Eve Archive is an ongoing project by Gary A. Anderson and Michael E. Stone to present all of the original texts in both the original languages and in translation. It currently contains English translations of the most important texts and a synopsis guide that allows the viewer to easily jump from a section in one source to parallel sections in other sources.

The main gymnasium also doubles as an auditorium, which is used for daily chapel services, special meetings, drama performances, and music concerts. =Hanneman Hall= Named after the late Robert Hanneman, Jr., a potato geneticist at the University of Wisconsin and friend of the college, Hanneman Hall houses Maranatha's nursing program and science department. =Dormitories= Maranatha has five men's and five women's dormitories; Spurgeon, Judson, Leland, Armitage, and Carey are the men's halls, while Day, Weeks, Melford, Hilsen, and Gould are the women's halls. Student life Students can participate in a variety of campus activities, including intramural sports, blood drives, special lectures, and college-sponsored games. Daily chapel services are also a part of life at Maranatha. Maranatha requires its students to follow a biblical code of personal conduct. Those who violate Maranatha's student life policies are subject to disciplinary action. All undergraduate students are required to live on campus until age 23, unless living with parents and commuting to classes. Dorm leadership consists of \\"room leaders,\\" \\"resident assistants,\\" and \\"dorm supervisors.\\" Resident assistants' responsibilities include completing room checks to ensure that all beds are made, trash cans have been emptied, and halls are generally tidy. Room leaders lead room devotions and take responsibility for leadership within the room. Dorm supervisors' roles are self-explanatory. Students may also be elected to student body office, where they participate in planning campus events, and leading special student meeting and programs. Additional leadership opportunities exist in numerous resident student organizations on campus.

The Color Guard provides support for all major College events. Cadets are also offered the opportunity to compete in Ranger Challenge, a national competition commonly referred to as the varsity sport of ROTC. Charlie Company has won the five-man category of the Ranger Challenge competition two of the last three years. Athletics Maranatha sports teams compete in NCCAA Division II and NCAA Division III. Men can participate in baseball, basketball, cross country, soccer, and volleyball. Women can compete in basketball, cross country, soccer, softball, and volleyball. The athletics teams were named the Crusaders, but in the fall of 2014, the name was changed to the Sabercats, while keeping the colors blue and gold. As of February 2, 2017 Maranatha has discontinued their football program after 47 years. Music groups *Symphonic Band: Typically a 50- to 60-member group under the direction of Dr. David Brown, which tours every fall, as well as performing several annual on- campus concerts (Christmas Chapel, Religious Liberty Day Chapel, Good Friday Chapel, Spring Concert).

It could be done using a motion to adjourn. A time for another meeting could be set using the motion to fix the time to which to adjourn. This motion establishes an adjourned meeting. To adjourn to another time or place defines suspended proceedings until a later stated time or place. Law In law, to adjourn means to suspend proceedings to another time or place, or to end them. Parliamentary procedure In deliberative assemblies, an adjournment ends a meeting. Under Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised (RONR), if no time or method has been fixed to reconvene the assembly, the adjournment has the effect of dissolving the body. = Motion to adjourn = A motion to adjourn is a privileged motion, unless it is qualified in any way (such as \\"adjourn at 10 p.m.\\"), the time for adjourning is already established, or unless adjournment would dissolve the assembly (in these cases, it is a main motion). The privileged motion to adjourn is used to end the meeting immediately without debate. If it is a main motion, it cannot interrupt pending business, and is amendable and debatable. If there is any unfinished business at the time of adjournment, it is carried over to the next meeting if that meeting is within a quarterly time interval. When a body has completed the scheduled order of business at a meeting and there is no further business for the assembly to consider at that time, the chair may simply declare the meeting adjourned without a motion having been made. Along with the motion to fix the time to which to adjourn, recess, and taking measures to obtain a quorum, it is one of the only motions allowed in the absence of a quorum. The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure (TSC) treats the motion to adjourn as a privileged motion but under fewer circumstances. Like RONR, TSC considers it a privileged motion (and thus non-debatable) when business is pending. As a privileged motion, however, TSC allows the motion to be amended to a limited extent to establish the time when the interrupted meeting will continue. Unlike under RONR, however, it is considered a main motion (debatable and amendable) when no business is pending. = Motion to Fix the time to which to adjourn = The motion to fix the time to which to adjourn is used to set the time (and possibly the place) for another meeting to continue business of the session. If it is moved while a question is pending, it is the highest ranking privileged motion. Otherwise, it is an incidental main motion. = Adjourned meeting = An adjourned meeting is a term used in parliamentary procedure to mean a meeting that is continued from the previous meeting. The motion to fix the time to which to adjourn sets up an adjourned meeting, which is part of the same session (series of related meetings). Despite the name, an adjourned meeting is not related to the act of adjourning (i.e. \\"an adjourned meeting\\" does not mean \\"a meeting that has been adjourned\\"). To reduce this confusion, an adjourned meeting is sometimes called a \\"continued meeting\\". An adjourned meeting is set up to complete the business of the assembly. After an adjourned meeting is scheduled, an item of business could be postponed to that meeting. The adjourned meeting must be scheduled before the next regular meeting of the assembly.  United States Congress  In the United States Congress, an adjournment of more than three days requires the consent of both houses (the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives). = Controversial adjournment = In March 1835, there was controversy on whether Congress could stay in session past the end of the term without adjourning. It was debated on whether the motion to adjourn was valid. Eventually there was an adjournment. This issue was resolved when the Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution set a specific date and time for the start of a new session.

His contributions were especially important in promoting urban development by increasing the size cities could reasonably attain (through better transportation) and by allowing greater concentration of business in commercial sections (through use of electric elevators in skyscrapers). He became known as the \\"Father of Electric Traction\\".He demonstrated an aptitude for science and mathematics, Sprague secured an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy in 1874. He pursued his electrical studies relentlessly after graduation in 1878 and 2 years at sea. Early life and education Sprague was born in Milford, Connecticut, in 1857 to David Cummings Sprague and Frances Julia King Sprague, a school teacher His mother died when he was ten, and was sent by his father to live with an aunt in New York. He attended Drury High School in North Adams, Massachusetts, and excelled in mathematics. After graduating high school, Sprague went to Springfield, Massachusetts, to take an entrance exam for West Point, but somehow unexpectedly was taking the four day entrance exam for the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. He got the highest score (twelve others took the exam), and to go to the school he needed to borrow money. A local contractor and a bank loaned him four thousand dollars, and he travelled to Maryland. There, he graduated seventh (out of thirty-six) in the class of 1878. Career =United States Navy, inventor= Notes on seamanship, with drawings of sailboat parts, and electrical equipment, by Frank J. Sprague, 1878-1880 He was commissioned as an ensign in the United States Navy. During his ensuing naval service, he first served on the USS Richmond, then the USS Minnesota. While in Asia, Sprague wrote stories he filed for the Boston Herald. While his ship was in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1881, Sprague invented the inverted type of dynamo. After he was transferred to the USS Lancaster, the flagship of the European Squadron, he installed the first electric call-bell system on a United States Navy ship. Sprague took leave to attend the International Exposition of Electricity of 1881 in Paris and the Crystal Palace Exhibition in Sydenham, England in 1882, where he was on the jury of awards for gas engines, dynamos and lamps. =Engineer for Edison= In 1883, Edward H. Johnson, a business associate of Thomas Edison, persuaded Sprague to resign his naval commission to work for Edison. Sprague, who began at a salary of $2,500, was neither happy with his salary nor his assignments. Sprague wanted to focus on motors, while motors bored Edison, who was consumed in making his incandescent lighting work. Edison sent Sprague to run the construction departments where Edison had built central power stations for his lighting systems in Sunbury, Pennsylvania, and Brockton, Massachusetts. One of Sprague's significant contributions to the Edison Laboratory at Menlo Park, New Jersey, was the introduction of mathematical methods. Prior to his arrival, Edison conducted many costly trial-and-error experiments. Sprague's approach was to calculate using mathematics the optimum parameters and thus save much needless tinkering. He did important work for Edison, including correcting Edison's system of mains and feeders for central station distribution. In 1884, he decided his interests in the exploitation of electricity lay elsewhere, and he left Edison to found the Sprague Electric Railway & Motor Company. =Electrical pioneer= By 1886, Sprague's company had introduced two important inventions: a constant-speed, non-sparking motor with fixed brushes, and regenerative braking, a method of braking that uses the drive motor to return power to the main supply system. His motor was the first to maintain constant speed under varying load. It was immediately popular and was endorsed by Edison as the only practical electric motor available. His regenerative braking system was important in the development of the electric train and the electric elevator. =Electric streetcars= Postcard of electric trolley-powered streetcars of the Richmond Union Passenger Railway in Richmond, Virginia, in 1923, two generations after Frank J. Sprague successfully demonstrated his new system on the hills in 1888. The intersection shown is at 8th & Broad Streets. Sprague's inventions included several improvements to designs for systems of electric streetcars collecting electricity from overhead lines.Middleton, William D. (1967). The Time of the Trolley, pp. 63‚Äì73. Milwaukee: Kalmbach Publishing. . He improved designs for a spring-loaded trolley pole that had been developed in 1885 by Charles Van Depoele, devised a greatly improved mounting for streetcar motors and better gear designs, and proved that regenerative braking was practical. After testing his trolley system in late 1887 and early 1888, Sprague installed the first successful large electric street railway system ‚Äì the Richmond Union Passenger Railway in Richmond, Virginia, which began passenger operation on February 2, 1888. Long a transportation obstacle, the hills of Richmond included grades of over 10%, and were an excellent proving ground for acceptance of his new technology in other cities, in contrast to the cable cars which climbed the steepest grades of Nob Hill in San Francisco at the time. By the summer of 1888, Henry M. Whitney of the West End Street Railway in Boston had witnessed the simultaneous startup of multiple streetcars on a single power source and had signed up for conversion. By January 1889, Boston had its first electric streetcars ‚Äî which would be the first in the Americas to go underground some eight years later ‚Äî and which had become so popular and noteworthy that poet Oliver Wendell Holmes composed a verse about the new trolley pole technology, and the sparking contact shoe at its apex: > :Since then on many a car you'll see :A broomstick as plain as plain can be; > :On every stick there's a witch astride‚Äî :The string you see to her leg is > tied. Within a year, electric power had started to replace more costly horsecars in many cities. By 1889 110 electric railways incorporating Sprague's equipment had been begun or planned on several continents. In 1890, Edison, who manufactured most of Sprague's equipment, bought him out, and Sprague turned his attention to electric elevators. However, he continued to be interested in the use of electricity for urban transportation and proposed a major expansion of London's Underground in 1901.The article was reprinted at the time as a booklet, now scarce Sprague's system of electric supply was a great advantage in relation to the first bipolar U-tube overhead lines, in everyday use since 1883 on the M√∂dling and Hinterbr√ºhl Tram. =Electric elevators= While electrifying the streetcars of Richmond, the increased passenger capacity and speed gave Sprague the notion that similar results could be achieved in vertical transportation ‚Äî electric elevators. He saw that increasing the capacity of elevator shafts would not only save passengers' time but would also increase the earnings of tall buildings, with height limited by the total floor space taken up in the shaftways by slow hydraulic-powered elevators. In 1892, Sprague founded the Sprague Electric Elevator Company. Working with Charles R. Pratt he developed the Sprague-Pratt Electric Elevator, the first of which was installed in the Postal Telegraph Building in 1894. The company developed floor control, automatic elevators, acceleration control of car safeties, and a number of freight elevators. The Sprague-Pratt elevator ran faster and with larger loads than hydraulic or steam elevators, and 584 elevators had been installed worldwide. Sprague then sold his company to the Otis Elevator Company in 1895. Sprague Electric Company, 1898. =Multiple unit train controls= Sprague's experience with elevator controlled him to devise a multiple unit system of electric railway operation, which accelerated the development of electric traction. In the multiple-unit system, each car of the train carries electric traction motors. By means of relays energized by train-line wires, the engineer (or motorman) commands all of the traction motors in the train to act together. For lighter trains there is no need for locomotives, so every car in the train can generate revenue. Where locomotives are used, one person can control all of them. Sprague's first multiple unit order was from the South Side Elevated Railroad (the first of several elevated railways locally known as the \\"L\\") in Chicago, Illinois. This success was quickly followed by substantial multiple-unit contracts in Brooklyn, New York and Boston, Massachusetts. =New York: Grand Central, elevators in skyscrapers= From 1896 to 1900 Sprague served on the Commission for Terminal Electrification of the New York Central Railroad, including the Grand Central Terminal in New York City, where he designed a system of automatic train control to ensure compliance with trackside signals. He founded the Sprague Safety Control & Signal Corporation to develop and build this system. Along with William J. Wilgus, he designed the Wilgus-Sprague bottom contact third rail system used by the railroads leading into Grand Central Terminal. During World War I, Sprague served on the Naval Consulting Board. Then, in the 1920s, he devised a method for safely running two independent elevators, local and express, in a single shaft, to conserve floor space. He sold this system, along with systems for activating elevator car safety systems when acceleration or speed became too great, to the Westinghouse Company. Legacy Sprague's developments in electric traction let cities grow larger, while his development of the elevator permitted greater concentration in their commercial sections and increased the profitability of commercial buildings. Sprague's inventions over 100 years ago made possible modern light rail and rapid transit systems which still function on the same principles today. The iconic Sprague-Thomson rolling stock of the Paris M√©tro, in service from 1908 to 1983, are still referred to as (\\"Sprague trainsets\\") today. Sprague's engines were used as far afield as Sydney Harbour in Australia. A five- horsepower Lundell electric motor used at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard between 1900 and 1980 is now in the collection of the National Museum of Australia in Canberra.

In addition, he received the Franklin Medal in 1921 and was posthumously awarded the John Fritz Gold Medal in 1935.Electrical World, Obituary, November 10, 1934 Personal life Sprague was twice married, first to a Mary Keatinge, and thereafter to Harriet Chapman Jones. Frank and Mary had one son, Frank Desmond.https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:2W3Z-GJ5 Frank and Harriet had two sons and a daughter: Robert C. Sprague (also an inventor), Julian K. and Frances A.https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:M5ZN-B38 Remembering his father, Robert wrote in 1935: Sprague died on October 25, 1934. He was buried with full U.S. Navy honors at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. His wife Harriet was interred with him after her death in 1969.Find-a-Grave, Frank Julian Sprague, Retrieved February 3, 2017 After Sprague's death, Harriet turned over a substantial amount of material from his collection to the New York Public Library, where it remains today accessible to the public via the rare books division.New York Public Library, Frank J. Sprague papers, Retrieved February 3, 2017 Other papers, including six volumes of congratulatory letters and photographs presented to Sprague on the occasion of his 75th birthday, is held at the Chapin Library, Williams College. In 1959, Harriet Sprague donated funds for the Sprague Building at the Shore Line Trolley Museum at East Haven, Connecticut, not far from Sprague's boyhood home in Milford. The museum is the oldest operating trolley museum in the United States and has one of the largest collections of trolley artifacts in the United States. Robert C. Sprague would go on to found and lead the Sprague Electric Company as its president (1926-1953) and CEO (1953-1987). Bought by Vishay Intertechnology in the 1992,http://www.vishay.com/company/about/ it had become a leading manufacturer of capacitors and other electronic components. Frank and Harriet's grandson Peter Sprague, an entrepreneur, would become CEO of National Semiconductor (1965-1995). In remembrance and popular culture In 1999, grandsons, John L. Sprague and Peter Sprague cut the ribbon and started an 1884 Sprague motor at a new exhibit at the Shore Line Trolley Museum, where a permanent exhibit, \\"Frank J. Sprague: Inventor, Scientist, Engineer\\", tells the story of the role of the \\"Father of Electric Traction\\" and the role of electricity in the growth of cities. In 2012, the Pennsylvania Trolley Museum adopted a stray cat, naming it after Sprague: Frank the Trolley Cat. In 2017, Sprague was the subject of a documentary episode, called The Race Underground, on season 29 of American Experience series that premiered on PBS television stations. It partly chronicled the beginnings of the Boston- area MBTA's streetcar network, which described him as \\"The Forgotten Hero of the American Subway\\".Doug Most, The Forgotten Hero of the American Subway, PBS References Further reading   External links * Arlington National Cemetery * Frank J.

It describes the positive and negative environmental effects of a proposed action, and it usually also lists one or more alternative actions that may be chosen instead of the action described in the EIS. Several U.S. state governments require that a document similar to an EIS be submitted to the state for certain actions. For example, in California, an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) must be submitted to the state for certain actions, as described in the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). One of the primary authors of the act is Lynton K. Caldwell. Preliminary versions of these documents are officially known as a draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) or draft environmental impact report (DEIR). Purpose The purpose of the NEPA is to promote informed decision-making by federal agencies by making \\"detailed information concerning significant environmental impacts\\" available to both agency leaders and the public.See the Supreme Court decision: Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 349 (1989). The NEPA was the first piece of legislation that created a comprehensive method to assess potential and existing environmental risks at once. It also encourages communication and cooperation between all the actors involved in environmental decisions, including government officials, private businesses, and citizens. In particular, an EIS acts as an enforcement mechanism to ensure that the federal government adheres to the goals and policies outlined in the NEPA. An EIS should be created in a timely manner as soon as the agency is planning development or is presented with a proposal for development. The statement should use an interdisciplinary approach so that it accurately assesses both the physical and social impacts of the proposed development. In many instances an action may be deemed subject to NEPA's EIS requirement even though the action is not specifically sponsored by a federal agency. These factors may include actions that receive federal funding, federal licensing or authorization, or that are subject to federal control.Eccleston, Charles H. (2008). NEPA and Environmental Planning: Tools, Techniques, and Approaches for Practitioners, pp 148-149. CRC Press. . Not all federal actions require a full EIS. If the action may or may not cause a significant impact, the agency can first prepare a smaller, shorter document called an Environmental Assessment (EA). The finding of the EA determines whether an EIS is required. If the EA indicates that no significant impact is likely, then the agency can release a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) and carry on with the proposed action. Otherwise, the agency must then conduct a full-scale EIS. Most EAs result in a FONSI. A limited number of federal actions may avoid the EA and EIS requirements under NEPA if they meet the criteria for a categorical exclusion (CATEX). A CATEX is usually permitted when a course of action is identical or very similar to a past course of action and the impacts on the environment from the previous action can be assumed for the proposed action, or for building a structure within the footprint of an existing, larger facility or complex. For example, two recently completed sections of Interstate 69 in Kentucky were granted a CATEX from NEPA requirements as these portions of I-69 utilize existing freeways that required little more than minor spot improvements and a change of highway signage. Additionally, a CATEX can be issued during an emergency when time does not permit the preparation of an EA or EIS. An example of the latter is when the Federal Highway Administration issued a CATEX to construct the replacement bridge in the wake of the I-35W Mississippi River Bridge Collapse. Contrary to a widespread misconception, NEPA does not prohibit the federal government or its licensees/permittees from harming the environment, but merely requires that the prospective impacts be understood and disclosed in advance. The intent of NEPA is to help key decisionmakers and stakeholders balance the need to implement an action with its impacts on the surrounding human and natural environment, and provide opportunities for mitigating those impacts while keeping the cost and schedule for implementing the action under control. However, many activities require various federal permits to comply with other environmental legislation, such as the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act and Section 4(f) of the Federal Highway Act to name a few. Similarly, many states and local jurisdictions have enacted environmental laws and ordinances, requiring additional state and local permits before the action can proceed. Obtaining these permits typically requires the lead agency to implement the Least Environmentally Damaging Practicable Alternative (LEDPA) to comply with federal, state, and local environmental laws that are ancillary to NEPA. In some instances, the result of NEPA analysis leads to abandonment or cancellation of the proposed action, particularly when the \\"No Action\\" alternative ends up being the LEDPA. Layout An EIS typically has four sections:Eccleston, Charles H. (2014). The EIS Book: Managing and Preparing Environmental Impact Statements. Chapter 6. CRC Press. . :* An Introduction including a statement of the Purpose and Need of the Proposed Action. :* A description of the Affected Environment. :* A Range of Alternatives to the proposed action. Alternatives are considered the \\"heart\\" of the EIS. :* An analysis of the environmental impacts of each of the possible alternatives. This section covers topics such as: ::* Impacts to threatened or endangered species ::* Air and water quality impacts ::* Impacts to historic and cultural sites, particularly sites of significant importance to Indigenous peoples. ::* Social and Economic impacts to local communities, often including consideration of attributes such as impacts on the available housing stock, economic impacts to businesses, property values, aesthetics and noise within the affected area ::* Cost and Schedule Analyses for each alternative, including costs and timeline to mitigate expected impacts, to determine if the proposed action can be completed at an acceptable cost and within a reasonable amount of time While not required in the EIS, the following subjects may be included as part of the EIS or as separate documents based on agency policy. :* Financial Plan for the proposed action identifying the sources of secured funding for the action. For example, the Federal Highway Administration has started requiring states to include a financial plan showing that funding has been secured for major highway projects before it will approve an EIS and issue a Record of Decision. :* An Environmental Mitigation Plan is often requested by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) if substantial environmental impacts are expected from the preferred alternative. :* Additional documentation to comply with state and local environmental policy laws and secure required federal, state, and local permits before the action can proceed. Every EIS is required to analyze a No Action Alternative, in addition to the range of alternatives presented for study. The No Action Alternative identifies the expected environmental impacts in the future if existing conditions were left as is with no action taken by the lead agency. Analysis of the No Action Alternative is used to establish a baseline upon which to compare the proposed \\"Action\\" alternatives. Contrary to popular belief, the \\"No Action Alternative\\" doesn't necessarily mean that nothing will occur if that option is selected in the Record of Decision. For example, the \\"No Action Alternative\\" was selected for the I-69/Trans-Texas Corridor Tier-I Environmental Impact Statement. In that Record of Decision, the Texas Department of Transportation opted not to proceed with building its portion of I-69 as one of the Trans-Texas Corridors to be built as a new- terrain route (the Trans-Texas Corridor concept was ultimately scrapped entirely), but instead decided to proceed with converting existing US routes to I-69 by upgrading those roads to interstate standards. NEPA process The NEPA process is designed to involve the public and gather the best available information in a single place so that decision makers can be fully informed when they make their choices. This is the process of EIS * Proposal: In this stage, the needs and objectives of a project have been decided, but the project has not been financed. * Categorical Exclusion (CATEX): As discussed above, the government may exempt an agency from the process. The agency can then proceed with the project and skip the remaining steps. * Environmental Assessment (EA): The proposal is analyzed in addition to the local environment with the aim to reduce the negative impacts of the development on the area. * Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI): Occurs when no significant impacts are identified in an EA. A FONSI typically allows the lead agency to proceed without having to complete an EIS. Environmental Impact Statement * Scoping: The first meetings are held to discuss existing laws, the available information, and the research needed. The tasks are divided up and a lead group is selected. Decision makers and all those involved with the project can attend the meetings. * Notice: The public is notified that the agency is preparing an EIS. The agency also provides the public with information regarding how they can become involved in the process. The agency announces its project proposal with a notice in the Federal Register, notices in local media, and letters to citizens and groups that it knows are likely to be interested. Citizens and groups are welcome to send in comments helping the agency identify the issues it must address in the EIS (or EA). * Draft EIS (DEIS): Based on both agency expertise and issues raised by the public, the agency prepares a Draft EIS with a full description of the affected environment, a reasonable range of alternatives, and an analysis of the impacts of each alternative. * Comment: Affected individuals then have the opportunity to provide feedback through written and public hearing statements. * Final EIS (FEIS) and Proposed Action: Based on the comments on the Draft EIS, the agency writes a Final EIS, and announces its Proposed Action. The public is not invited to comment on this, but if they are still unhappy, or feel that the agency has missed a major issue, they may protest the EIS to the Director of the agency. The Director may either ask the agency to revise the EIS, or explain to the protester why their complaints are not actually taken care of. *Re-evaluation: Prepared following an approved FEIS or ROD when unforeseen changes to the proposed action or its impacts occurs, or when a substantial period of time has passed between approval of an action and the planned start of said action. Based on the significance of the changes, three outcomes may result from a re-evaluation report: (1) the action may proceed with no substantive changes to the FEIS, (2) significant impacts are expected with the change that can be adequately addressed in a Supplemental EIS (SEIS), or (3) the circumstances force a complete change in the nature and scope of the proposed action, thereby voiding the pre-existing FEIS (and ROD, if applicable), requiring the lead agency to restart the NEPA process and prepare a new EIS to encompass the changes. * Supplemental EIS (SEIS): Typically prepared after either a Final EIS or Record of Decision has been issued and new environmental impacts that were not considered in the original EIS are discovered, requiring the lead agency to re-evaluate its initial decision and consider new alternatives to avoid or mitigate the new impacts. Supplemental EISs are also prepared when the size and scope of a federal action changes, when a significant period of time has lapsed since the FEIS was completed to account for changes in the surrounding environment during that time, or when all of the proposed alternatives in an EIS are deemed to have unacceptable environmental impacts and new alternatives are proposed. * Record of Decision (ROD): Once all the protests are resolved the agency issues a Record of Decision which is its final action prior to implementation. If members of the public are still dissatisfied with the outcome, they may sue the agency in Federal court. Often, the agencies responsible for preparing an EA or EIS do not compile the document directly, but outsource this work to private-sector consulting firms with expertise in the proposed action and its anticipated effects on the environment. Because of the intense level of detail required in analyzing the alternatives presented in an EIS or EA, such documents may take years or even decades to compile, and often compose of multiple volumes that can be thousands to tens of thousands of pages in length. To avoid potential conflicts in securing required permits and approvals after the ROD is issued, the lead agency will often coordinate with stakeholders at all levels, and resolve any conflicts to the greatest extent possible during the EIS process. Proceeding in this fashion helps avoid interagency conflicts and potential lawsuits after the lead agency reaches its decision. =Tiering= On exceptionally large projects, especially proposed highway and railroad corridors that cross long distances, the lead agency may use a two-tiered process prior to implementing the proposed action. In such cases, the Tier I EIS would analyze the potential socio-environmental impacts along a general corridor, but would not identify the exact location of where the action would occur. A Tier I ROD would be issued approving the general area where the action would be implemented. Following the Tier I ROD, the approved Tier I area is further broken down into subareas, and a Tier II EIS is then prepared for each subarea, that identifies the exact location of where the proposed action will take place. The preparation of Tier II EISs for each subarea proceeds at its own pace, independent from the other subareas within the Tier I area. For example, parts of the proposed Interstate 69 extension in Indiana and Texas are being studied through a two-tiered process Strengths By requiring agencies to complete an EIS, the act encourages them to consider the environmental costs of a project and introduces new information into the decision-making process. The NEPA has increased the influence of environmental analysts and agencies in the federal government by increasing their involvement in the development process. Because an EIS requires expert skill and knowledge, agencies must hire environmental analysts. Unlike agencies who may have other priorities, analysts are often sympathetic to environmental issues. In addition, this feature introduces scientific procedures into the political process.Taylor, Serge. 1984. \\"Making Bureaucracies Think: The Environmental Impact Statement Strategy of Administrative Reform\\". Stanford University Press: Stanford, CA. Limitations The differences that exist between science and politics limit the accuracy of an EIS. Although analysts are members of the scientific community, they are affected by the political atmosphere. Analysts do not have the luxury of an unlimited time for research. They are also affected by the different motives behind the research of the EIS and by different perspectives of what constitutes a good analysis. In addition, government officials do not want to reveal an environmental problem from within their own agency. Citizens often misunderstand the environmental assessment process. The public does not realize that the process is only meant to gather information relevant to the decision. Even if the statement predicts negative impacts of the project, decision makers can still proceed with the proposal.

It is a collection of remixes and remakes from previous albums, with the exception of their then- recent record The Dark Saga. Most of the songs from the Enter the Realm EP, Iced Earth, and Night of the Stormrider were re-sung by Matt Barlow, and on some of the songs the drums and bass were redone. The 2-CD version also has rough mixes of several songs from Burnt Offerings with the opening to the title track re-recorded. The album cover features artwork of the Chaos Comics character Purgatori. The reason for the album was to improve the original songs, create nostalgia for older fans and introduce newer fans to Iced Earth's older work. The 2-CD limited edition was originally produced for European audiences but has since been released in the United States. Days of Purgatory was the last new release from the band featuring longtime guitarist Randall Shawver, and the first to feature bassist James MacDonough and drummer Brent Smedley. The song \\"Written on the Walls\\" from the band's self titled album was given completely new lyrics and renamed \\"Cast in Stone\\". The only songs left unrecorded from the band's first albums were \\"Mystical End\\", \\"The Path I Choose\\", and \\"Curse the Sky\\", though the latter two were both performed live with Barlow on vocals. \\"Winter Nights\\" was recorded during early sessions for Night of the Stormrider while Gene Adam was still on vocals, but this was the track which prompted Schaffer to ask Adam to get singing lessons, as it was felt he could not handle the high notes. Therefore, the song was not used on the album due to its acrimonious history, though it would have fit in with the storyline of the album. Live performances of this song from that era (such as Wuppertal '91) show him struggling to sing it, probably contributing to his dismissal. Schaffer eventually dug the song out of the vaults to use on this album with Barlow providing vocals, but, as mentioned in the album's booklet, used a 1986 Purgatory demo for the backing track instead.

First formed in July 1913, the squadron served throughout the First World War, holding the distinction of gaining the first loss and kill for the Royal Flying Corps. No. V Squadron relocated to India in 1920 where it remained during the Second World War. During the Cold War, No. 5 (Fighter) Squadron flew the English Electric Lightning and Panavia Tornado F.3 before disbanding in September 2002. Since its reformation on 1 April 2004, it has operated the Raytheon Sentinel R.1 Airborne STand-Off Radar (ASTOR) aircraft from RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire. History =Formation to First World War= A Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8, similar to what No. V Squadron flew between May 1917 and March 1918. No. 5 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) was formed at Farnborough, Hampshire, on 26 July 1913,Lewis 1959, p.14. from members of No. 3 Squadron. Following the outbreak of the First World War, No. V Squadron deployed to France on 15 August 1914, equipped with a variety of aircraft types to implement reconnaissance for the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). It flew its first missions on 21 August and on the next day, an Avro 504 of No. 5 Squadron was the first British aircraft to be shot down, its crew of pilot Second Lieutenant Vincent Waterfall and navigator Lieutenant Charles George Gordon Bayly being killed over Belgium.Jackson 1990 p.56\\"Casualty Details:Vincent Waterfall\\". Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Retrieved 24 December 2016.\\"Casualty Details:Charles Bayly\\". Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Retrieved 24 December 2016. On 24 August, No. V Squadron became the first unit in the RFC to shoot down an enemy aircraft with gunfire when Lt. Wilson and Lt. Rabagliati shot down a German Etrich Taube near Le Cateau-Cambr√©sis. No. 5 Squadron standardised on the Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2, specialising as observers for artillery, re-equipping with the Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8 in May 1917, and working closely with the Canadian Corps, through to the end of the war and into 1919, when it moved into Germany as part of the Army of Occupation.Ashworth 1989, pp. 34‚Äì35. (Its association with the Canadian Corps led to the incorporation of a maple leaf in the squadron's badge when it was approved in June 1937).Ashworth 1989, p.34. =Interwar years= No. V Squadron returned to the UK in September 1919 before disbanding on 20 January 1920. The squadron was reformed at Quetta, India (now part of Pakistan) on 1 April 1920, when No. 48 Squadron was renumbered. There it continued working in Army Air Cooperation for operations on the North West Frontier. Upon reformation the unit was equipped with the Bristol F.2B which were flown up until 1931. In May 1931, No. 5 Squadron began to convert to the Westland Wapiti Mk.IIa. =Second World War= Westland Wapiti Mk.IIas, similar to what No. 5 Squadron operated in India between May 1931 and June 1940. At the outbreak of war in September 1939, No. 5 Squadron were based at Fort Sandeman, still equipped with the Westland Wapiti biplane. The squadron became a light bomber unit when it converted to the Hawker Hart in June 1940. No. 5 Squadron further converted to the Hawker Audax in February 1941, using it as a fighter. In December 1941, the squadron relocated to RAF Dum Dum, Calcutta, and began to receive their first monoplane ‚Äì the American- built Curtiss Mohawk Mk.IV. Posted to RAF Dinjan, Assam, in May 1942, No. V Squadron became tasked with escorting Bristol Blenheim bombers over north west Burma. The Mohawks were replaced by Hawker Hurricane Mk.IIcs and Mk.IIds in June 1943 while the squadron was based at RAF Kharagpur. In September 1944, No. 5 Squadron converted to the Republic Thunderbolt Mk.I and Mk.II. In May 1945, No. V Squadron was withdrawn from the front line in preparation for the liberation of Malaya from Japanese occupation, however this was never carried out due to the Japanese Empire surrendering on 15 August 1945. =Cold War= Remaining in India, No. 5 Squadron converted to Hawker Tempest F.2 in February 1946, but disbanded on 1 August 1947 due to the Partition of India.Ashworth 1989, p.356. On 11 February 1949, the squadron reformed at RAF Pembrey in Wales for target-towing duties when No. 595 Squadron was renumbered, however the squadron was shortly disbanded on 25 September 1951. The squadron was reformed at RAF Wunsdorf, West Germany, on 1 March 1952, and were equipped with the de Havilland Vampire F.5. No. V Squadron converted over to the de Havilland Venom FB.1 in December 1952. The 1957 Defence White Paper saw the disbandment of No. 5 Squadron on 12 October 1957 while operating the Venom FB.5. On 20 January 1959, the squadron was reformed as a night fighter unit at RAF Laarbruch, West Germany, flying the Gloster Meteor NF.11. No. 5 Squadron began converting to the delta winged Gloster Javelin FAW.5 in January 1960. When No. 33 Squadron was disbanded on 17 December 1962, No. V Squadron was allocated the former unit's Javelin FAW.9, along with crew members. No. 5 Squadron itself was disbanded on 7 October 1965 at RAF Geilenkirchen. =Lightning and Tornado (1965‚Äì2003)= Avro Vulcan B.2, April 1968. (Note the Maltese cross zaps on the tails from an APC deployment to RAF Luqa in October 1967). The squadron reformed as No. 5 (Fighter) Squadron at RAF Binbrook, Lincolnshire, on 8 October 1965 with the English Electric Lightning interceptor. However, upon reformation the unit did not initially operate a Lightning, with the squadron first flying Hawker Hunter T.7A WV318 fitted with Lightning instruments. No. 5 (F) Squadron's first Lightning arrived on 19 November, when Lightning T.5 XS451 was delivered to RAF Binbrook. The squadron's first single seat Lightnings arrived on 10 December 1965, when Lightning F.3s XR755 and XR756 were delivered. No. V (F) Squadron received their first production Lightning F.6 on 3 January 1967, with the arrival of XS694. Between 6 and 25 October 1967, the squadron deployed to RAF Luqa, Malta, with nine Lightning F.6s and a single Lighting T.5 for an Armament Practice Camp (APC), as well as an Air Defence Exercise (ADEX) against Avro Vulcan B.2s of No. 50 Squadron. No. 5 (F) Squadron deployed to RAF Luqa once again between 1 and 8 August 1968 for Exercise Nimble. In 1970, the squadron received a pair of Lightning F.1As (XM181 and XM183), which were used as targets for the Lightning F.6s due to them being lighter and more nimble (these were later replaced with Lightning F.3s). On 8 September 1970, the squadron lost Lightning F.6 XS894 when it crashed near Flamborough Head, Yorkshire, killing the pilot USAF Capt. William Schaffner. No. V (F) Squadron deployed two Lighting F.3s, seven Lightning F.6s and a single two-seat T.5 to RAF Luqa between 18 November and 13 December 1974, as part of Exercise Sunfinder alongside Avro Shackleton AEW.2s of No. 8 Squadron and English Electric Canberra B.2s of No. 85 Squadron. Between 5 April and 7 May 1976, the squadron deployed to RAF Luqa with ten Lightning F.6s for an APC. No. 5 (F) Squadron's last APC deployment to RAF Luqa was between 31 March and 5 May 1977. In November 1987, No. V (F) Squadron put up a nine-ship of Lightning F.6s to mark the type's impending withdrawal after 22 years of service. The last Lightnings were withdrawn by December 1987, with the squadron relocating to RAF Coningsby in preparation for the Panavia Tornado F.3. No. 5 (F) Squadron received their first Tornado F.3 in January 1988. In August 1990, No. 5 (F) Squadron was the first RAF squadron (accompanied by No. 29 (F) Squadron) to be deployed as part the UK's contribution to the Gulf War, with the first six Tornado F.3s arriving on 11 August at Dhahran Airfield, Saudi Arabia. Between 1993 and 1995, the squadron helped enforce the no-fly zone over Bosnia and Herzegovina as part of Operation Deny Flight. No. 5 (F) Squadron disbanded on 30 September 2002, with personnel being reassigned to other units. =Sentinel R.1 (2004‚Äìpresent)= No. 5 (AC) Squadron Raytheon Sentinel R.1 ZJ692 at RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus, March 2019. The squadron reformed on 1 April 2004 as No. 5 (Army Co-operation) Squadron at RAF Waddington. The first production Raytheon Sentinel R.1 made its maiden flight on 26 May 2004. The ASTOR system officially entered service with the No. 5 (AC) Squadron on 1 December 2008. The fifth and last Sentinel to be delivered to the squadron was ZJ694 in February 2009. Full Operating Capability was achieved at the end of 2010.\\"ASTOR Enters Service\\". Air International, Vol 76 No. 1, January 2009. p.5. The new radar-equipped aircraft provides battlefield and ground surveillance for the British Army in a similar role to the American Northrop Grumman E-8 Joint STARS aircraft. August 2013. In 2011, Sentinels from No. V (AC) Squadron participated in operations over Libya as part of Operation Ellamy, which were later described as pivotal by RAF Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Dalton. Between 2009 and 2011, No. V (AC) Squadron also briefly operated four Hawker Beechcraft Shadow R.1, based on the Beechcraft King Air 350.Royal Air Force Yearbook 2009, p23 The first Shadow R.1 (ZZ416) was delivered to the squadron in May 2009. These were transferred over to the newly reformed No. 14 Squadron in October 2011. On 25 January 2013, a Sentinel R.1 deployed to Dakar-Ouakam Air Base, Senegal, to assist with France's Operation Serval in Mali. Over the course of a four-month long detachment, Sentinels flew a total of 697 hours across 66 sorties. On 18 May 2014, the squadron deployed a Sentinel to Kotoka International Airport, Ghana, in order to assist with searching for 223 schoolgirls who had been kidnapped by Boko Haram in Nigeria. In September 2014, the squadron temporarily relocated to RAF Cranwell along with No. 14 Squadron due to the resurfacing of RAF Waddington's runway which took over a year to complete. No. 5 (AC) Squadron sent a single Sentinel R.1 to Exercise Red Flag 15-1 at Nellis AFB, Nevada, between 26 January and 13 February 2015. On 26 March 2015, No. 5 (AC) Squadron deployed two Sentinel R.1s to RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus, in support of Operation Shader. In July 2017, Sentinel R.1 ZJ693 was withdrawn from use, with the remaining four Sentinels being given an out of service date (OSD) of 2021. In February 2020, the OSD was confirmed by the Ministry of Defence as March 2021.

It is located in Sumiyoshi-ku, Osaka.  History  OCU's predecessor was founded in 1880, as with donations by local merchants. It became Osaka Commercial School in 1885, then was municipalized in 1889. Osaka City was defeated in a bid to draw the Second National Commercial College (the winner was Kobe City), so the city authorities decided to establish a municipal commercial college without any aid from the national budget. In 1901, the school was reorganized to become , later authorized under Specialized School Order in 1904. The college had grand brick buildings around the Taish≈ç period. In 1928, the college became , the first municipal university in Japan. The city mayor, declared the spirit of the municipal university, that it should not simply copy the national universities and that it should become a place for research with a background of urban activities in Osaka. But, contrary to his words, the university was removed to the most rural part of the city by 1935. The first president of the university was a liberalist, so the campus gradually became what was thought to be \\"a den of the Reds (Marxists)\\". During World War II, the Marxists and the socialists in the university were arrested (about 50 to 80 members) soon after the liberal president died. The campus was evacuated and used by the Japanese Navy. After the war, the campus was occupied by the U.S. Army (named \\"Camp Sakai\\"), and a number of students became anti-American fighters and \\"worshipers\\" of the Soviet Union. The campus was returned to the university, partly in 1952, and fully in 1955. In 1949, during the allied occupation, the university was merged (with other two municipal colleges) into Osaka City University, under Japan's new educational system. The \\"Chapel\\", one of the remains of Camp Sakai, built around 1950, removed in 2005 In 1949 OCU had five faculties (Business / Economics / Law and Literature / Science and Engineering / Home Economics). In 1953, the Faculty of Law and Literature was divided into two faculties. In 1955, Osaka City Medical University was incorporated and became the Faculty of Medicine. In 1959, the Faculty of Science and Engineering was divided into two faculties. In 1975, the Faculty of Home Economics was reorganized into the Faculty of Human Life Science. In 2003, the Graduate School of Creative Cities was established. In 2006, the Urban Research Plaza and the Advanced Research Institute for Natural Science and Technology were established. Due to financial problems in many cities, all of the municipal universities in Japan were requested to incorporate. OCU became a Public University Corporation in 2006. In 2015 OCU celebrated its 135th anniversary.

Beginning from the autograph of the Duetto da camera Pria ch'io faccia by Agostino Steffani. Agostino Steffani (25 July 165412 February 1728) was an Italian ecclesiastic, diplomat and composer. Biography Steffani was born at Castelfranco Veneto on 25 July 1654. At a very early age he was admitted as a chorister at San Marco, Venice. In 1667, the beauty of his voice attracted the attention of Count Georg Ignaz von Tattenbach, who took Steffani to Munich, where Steffani's education was completed at the expense of Ferdinand Maria, Elector of Bavaria, who appointed him Churf√ºrstlicher Kammer- und Hofmusikus and granted him a liberal salary. After receiving instruction from Johann Kaspar Kerll, in whose charge he lived, Steffani was sent in 1673 to study in Rome, where Ercole Bernabei was his master, and among other works he composed six motets, the original manuscripts of which are now in the Fitzwilliam Museum at Cambridge. On his return to Munich with Bernabei in 1674, Steffani published his first work, Psalmodia vespertina, a part of which was reprinted in Giovanni Battista Martini's Saggio di contrappunto in 1774. In 1675, Steffani was appointed court organist. The date when he was ordained priest, with the title of Abbate of Lepsing, is not precisely known. His ecclesiastical status did not prevent him from turning his attention to the stage, for which, at different periods of his life, he composed work which undoubtedly exercised a potent influence upon the dramatic music of the period. Of his first opera, Marco Aurelio, written for the carnival and produced at Munich in 1681, the only copy known to exist is a manuscript score preserved in the royal library at Buckingham Palace. It was followed by Solone in 1685, by Audacia e rispetto, Prerogative d'amore, and Servio Tullio in 1686, by Alarico in 1687, and by Niobe, regina di Tebe in 1688. Notwithstanding the favor shown to him by the Elector Maximilian Emanuel, Steffani accepted in 1688 the appointment of Kapellmeister at the court of Hanover, where he speedily improved an acquaintance dating from 1681 with Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg (afterwards Elector of Hanover), winning also a pleasant footing with the Elector's daughter Sophia Charlotte (afterwards Electress of Brandenburg and Queen of Prussia), the philosopher Leibniz, the Abbate Ortensio Mauro, and many men of letters and intelligence, and where, in 1710, he showed great kindness to Handel, who was then just entering upon his glorious career. Steffani inaugurated a long series of triumphs in Hanover by composing, for the opening of the new opera house in 1689, an opera called Henrico Leone on Henry the Lion, which was produced with extraordinary splendour and achieved an immense reputation. For the same theatre he composed La Lotta d'Ercole con Achilleo in 1689, La Superbia d'Alessandro in 1690, Orlando generoso in 1691, Le Rivali concordi in 1692, La Liberia contenta in 1693, I trionfi del fato and I Baccanali in 1695, and Briseide (with Pietro Torri Briseide : dramma per musica da recitarsi alla Carte Elettorale d'Hannover per il carnevale dell' anno 1696.) in 1696. The libretto of Briseide is by Francesco Palmieri.Timms, Colin Ronald. The Chamber Duets of Agostino Steffani (1654-1728), with Transcriptions and Catalogue. Dissertation submitted for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in the Faculty of Music. University of London King's College, 1976, p. 49. Those of most if not all the others are by the Abbate Mauro. The scores are preserved at Buckingham Palace, where, in company with five volumes of songs and three of duets, they form part of the collection brought to England by the Elector of Hanover in 1714, when ascending as King George I of Great Britain. But it was not only as a musician that Steffani distinguished himself in his new home. The elevation of Ernest Augustus to the electorate in 1692 led to difficulties, for the arrangement of which it was necessary that an ambassador should visit the various German courts, armed with a considerable amount of diplomatic power. The accomplished abbate was sent on this delicate mission in 1696, with the title of envoy extraordinary, and he fulfilled his difficult task so well that Pope Innocent XI, in recognition of certain privileges he had secured for the Hanoverian Catholics, consecrated him bishop of Spiga on the Sea of Marmora (modern day Biga in Turkey). Between 1709 and 1723 Steffani served as Vicar Apostolic of Upper and Lower Saxony, a new Roman Catholic diaspora jurisdiction, embracing Upper and Lower Saxon territories. In 1698, he was sent as ambassador to Brussels, and after the death of Ernest Augustus in the same year he entered the service of the Elector Palatine, John William, at D√ºsseldorf, where he held the offices of privy councillor and protonotary of the Holy See. Invested with these high honours, Steffani could scarcely continue to produce dramatic compositions in public without grievous breach of etiquette. But his genius was too importunate to submit to repression; and in 1709 he ingeniously avoided the difficulty by producing two new operas: Enea at Hanover and Tassilone at D√ºsseldorf in the name of his secretary and amanuensis Gregorio Piva, whose signature is attached to the scores preserved at Buckingham Palace. Another score, that of Arminio in the same collection, dated D√ºsseldorf, 1707, and evidently the work of Steffani, bears no composer's name. Steffani did not accompany the elector George to England; but in 1724 the Academy of Ancient Music in London elected him its honorary president for life; and in return for the compliment he sent the association a magnificent Stabat Mater, for six voices and orchestra, and three fine madrigals. The manuscripts of these are still in existence, and the British Library possesses a very fine Confitebor, for three voices and orchestra, of about the same period. All these compositions are very much in advance of the age in which they were written; and in his operas Steffani shows an appreciation of the demands of the stage very remarkable indeed at a period at which the musical drama was gradually approaching the character of a merely formal concert, with scenery and dresses. But for the manuscripts at Buckingham Palace these operas would be utterly unknown; but Steffani will never cease to be remembered for his beautiful chamber duets, which, like those of his contemporary Carlo Maria Clari (1669‚Äì1745), are chiefly written in the form of cantatas for two voices, accompanied by a figured bass. The British Library (Add MS 5055-5056) possesses more than a hundred of these charming compositions, some of which were published at Munich in 1679. Steffani visited Italy for the last time in 1727, in which year Handel, who always gratefully remembered the kindness he had received from him at Hanover, once more met him at the palace of Cardinal Ottoboni in Rome. This was the last time the two composers were destined to meet. Steffani returned soon afterwards to Hanover, and died on 12 February 1728 while engaged in the transaction of some diplomatic business at Frankfurt. Steffani stands somewhat apart from contemporary Italian composers (e.g., Alessandro Scarlatti) in his mastery of instrumental forms. His opera overtures, etc., show a remarkable combination of Italian suavity with a logical conciseness of construction attributable to French influence.

Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner, (23 March 185413 May 1925) was a British statesman and colonial administrator who played a role in the formulation of foreign and domestic policy between the mid-1890s and early 1920s. From December 1916 to November 1918, he was one of the most important members of David Lloyd George's War Cabinet. Early life and education Milner's partial German ancestry dates to his paternal grandmother, married to an Englishman who settled in the Grand Duchy of Hesse (modern state of Hesse in west-central Germany). Their son, Charles Milner, who was educated in Hesse and England, established himself as a physician with a practice in London and later became Reader in English at University of T√ºbingen in the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg (modern state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg). His wife was a daughter of Major General John Ready, former Lieutenant Governor of Prince Edward Island and later the Isle of Man. Their only son, Alfred Milner, was born in the Hessian town of Giessen and educated first at T√ºbingen, then at King's College School and, from 1872 to 1876, as a scholar of Balliol College, Oxford, studying under the classicist theologian Benjamin Jowett. Having won the Hertford, Craven, Eldon and Derby scholarships, he graduated in 1877 with a first class in classics and was elected to a fellowship at New College, leaving, however, for London in 1879.New College Bulletin, November 2008 At Oxford he formed a close friendship with young economic historian Arnold Toynbee, writing a paper in support of his theories of social work and, in 1895, twelve years after his death at the age of 30, penning a tribute, Arnold Toynbee: a Reminiscence. Journalism, politics and service in Egypt Although authorised to practise law after being called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1881, he joined the staff of the Pall Mall Gazette under John Morley, becoming assistant editor to William Thomas Stead. In 1885 he abandoned journalism for a potential political career as the Liberal candidate for the Harrow division of Middlesex, but lost in the general election. Holding the post of private secretary to George Goschen, he rose in rank when, in 1887, Goschen became Chancellor of the Exchequer and, two years later, used his influence to have Milner appointed under-secretary of finance in Egypt. He remained in Egypt for four years, his period of office coinciding with the first great reforms, after the danger of bankruptcy had been avoided. Returning to England in 1892, he published England and Egypt which, at once, became the authoritative account of the work done since the British occupation. Later that year he received an appointment as chairman of the Board of Inland Revenue. In 1894 he was made CB and in 1895 KCB. In Southern Africa Alfred Milner remained at the Board of Inland Revenue until 1897. He was regarded as one of the clearest-headed and most judicious officials in the British service, and his position as a man of moderate Liberal views, who had been so closely associated with Goschen at the Treasury, Cromer in Egypt and Hicks-Beach (Lord St Aldwyn) and Sir William Vernon Harcourt while at the Inland Revenue, marked him as one in whom all parties might have confidence. The moment for testing his capacity in the highest degree had now come. In April, Lord Rosmead resigned his posts of High Commissioner for Southern Africa and Governor of Cape Colony. The situation resulting from the Jameson raid was one of the greatest delicacy and difficulty, and Joseph Chamberlain, now Colonial Secretary, selected Milner as Lord Rosmead's successor. The choice was cordially approved by the leaders of the Liberal party and warmly recognised at a farewell dinner on 28 March 1897 presided over by the future prime minister H. H. Asquith. The appointment was avowedly made in order that an acceptable British statesman, in whom public confidence was reposed, might go to South Africa to consider all the circumstances and to formulate a policy which should combine the upholding of British interests with the attempt to deal justly with the Transvaal and Orange Free State governments. Milner reached the Cape in May 1897 and by August, after the difficulties with President Kruger over the Aliens' Law had been patched up, he was free to make himself personally acquainted with the country and peoples before deciding on the lines of policy to be adopted. Between August 1897 and May 1898 he travelled through Cape Colony, the Bechuanaland Protectorate, Rhodesia, and Basutoland. To better understand the point of view of the Cape Dutch and the burghers of the Transvaal and Orange Free State, Milner also during this period learned both Dutch and the South African \\"Taal\\" Afrikaans. He came to the conclusion that there could be no hope of peace and progress in South Africa while there remained the \\"permanent subjection of British to Dutch in one of the Republics\\". Milner was referring to the situation in the Transvaal where, in the aftermath of the discovery of gold, thousands of fortune seekers had flocked from all over Europe, but mostly Britain. This influx of foreigners, referred to as \\"Uitlanders\\", threatened their republic, and Transvaal's President Kruger refused to give the \\"Uitlanders\\" the right to vote. The Afrikaner farmers, known as Boers, had established the Transvaal as their promised land, after their Great Trek out of Cape Colony, a trek whose purpose was to remove themselves as far as possible from British rule. They had already successfully defended the Transvaal's annexation by the British Empire during the first Anglo-Boer War, a conflict that had emboldened them and resulted in a peace treaty which, lacking a highly convincing pretext, made it very difficult for Britain to justify diplomatically another annexation of the Transvaal. Independent Transvaal thus stood in the way of Britain's ambition to control all of Africa from the Cape to Cairo. Milner realised that, with the discovery of gold in the Transvaal, the balance of power in South Africa had shifted from Cape Town to Johannesburg. He feared that if the whole of South Africa were not quickly brought under British control, the newly-wealthy Transvaal, controlled by Afrikaners, could unite with Cape Afrikaners and jeopardise the entire British position in South Africa. Milner also realised‚Äîas was shown by the triumphant re-election of Paul Kruger to the presidency of the Transvaal in February 1898‚Äîthat the Pretoria government would never on its own initiative redress the grievances of the Uitlanders. This gave Milner the pretext to use the \\"Uitlander\\" question to his advantage. In a speech delivered on 3 March 1898 at Graaff Reinet, an Afrikaner Bond stronghold in the British controlled Cape, Milner outlined his determination to secure freedom and equality for British subjects in the Transvaal, and he urged the Dutch colonists to induce the Pretoria government to assimilate its institutions, and the temper and spirit of its administration, to those of the free communities of South Africa. The effect of this pronouncement was great and it alarmed the Afrikaners who, at this time, viewed with apprehension the virtual resumption by Cecil Rhodes of leadership of the Cape's Progressive (British) Party. Later in 1899, Milner would meet Violet Cecil, the wife of Major Lord Edward Cecil. Edward Cecil was commissioned to South Africa after serving in the Grenadier Guards. Milner and Violet would begin a secret affair that would last until her departure in late 1900 back to England. She had a noticeable effect on his disposition, Milner himself wrote in his diary that he was feeling \\"very low indeed\\". Edward Cecil learned of this affair and pushed for a commission to Egypt after Violet pushed to return to South Africa. Milner would later marry Violet Cecil. Milner had an unfavourable view of Afrikaners and, as a matter of philosophy, saw the British as \\"a superior race\\". Thus, with limited interest in peaceful resolution of the conflict, he came to the view that British control of the region could only be achieved through war. Famously, after meeting Milner for the first time, Jan Smuts predicted that he would be \\"more dangerous than Rhodes\\" and would become \\"a second Bartle Frere\\". =Milner Schools= In order to Anglicise the Transvaal area during the Anglo-Boer war, Milner set out to influence British education in the area for the English-speaking populations. He founded a series of schools known as the \\"Milner Schools\\" in South Africa. These schools include modern-day Pretoria High School for Girls, Pretoria Boys High School, Jeppe High School for Boys, King Edward VII School (Johannesburg), Potchefstroom High School for Boys and Hamilton Primary School. Although not all Afrikander Bond leaders liked Kruger, they were ready to support him whether or not he granted reforms and, by the same result, contrived to make Milner's position untenable. His difficulties were increased when, at the general election in Cape Colony, the Bond obtained a majority. In October 1898, acting strictly in a constitutional manner, Milner called upon William Philip Schreiner to form a ministry, though aware that such a ministry would be opposed to any direct intervention of Great Britain in the Transvaal. Convinced that the existing state of affairs, if continued, would end in the loss of South Africa by Britain, Milner visited England in November 1898. He returned to Cape Colony in February 1899, fully assured of Joseph Chamberlain's support, though the government still clung to the hope that the moderate section of the Cape and Orange Free State Dutch would induce Kruger to give the vote to the Uitlanders. He found the situation more critical than when he had left, ten weeks previously. Johannesburg was in a ferment, while William Francis Butler, who acted as high commissioner in Milner's absence, had allowed the inference that he did not support Uitlander grievances. =Protection for the Uitlanders in the Transvaal= Vanity Fair in 1897 On 4 May, Milner penned a memorable dispatch to the Colonial Office, in which he insisted that the remedy for the unrest in the Transvaal was to strike at the root of the evil‚Äîthe political impotence of the injured Uitlanders. \\"It may seem a paradox,\\" he wrote, \\"but it is true that the only way for protecting our subjects is to help them to cease to be our subjects.\\" The policy of leaving things alone only led from bad to worse, and \\"the case for intervention is overwhelming.\\" Milner felt that only the enfranchisement of the Uitlanders in the Transvaal would give stability to the South African situation. He had not based his case against the Transvaal on the letter of the Conventions, and regarded the employment of the word \\"suzerainty\\" merely as an \\"etymological question,\\" but he realised keenly that the spectacle of thousands of British subjects in the Transvaal in the condition of \\"helots\\" (as he expressed it) was undermining the prestige of Great Britain throughout South Africa, and he called for \\"some striking proof\\" of the intention of the British government not to be ousted from its predominant position. This dispatch was telegraphed to London, and was intended for immediate publication; but it was kept private for a time by the home government. Its tenor was known, however, to the leading politicians at the Cape, and at the insistence of Jan Hendik Hofmeyr a peace conference was held (31 May5 June) at Bloemfontein between the high commissioner and Transvaal President Kruger. Milner made three demands, which he knew could not be accepted by Kruger: The enactment by the Transvaal of a franchise law which would at once give the Uitlanders the vote; the use of English in the Transvaal parliament; and that all laws of the parliament should be vetted and approved by the British parliament. Realizing the untenability of his position, Kruger left the meeting in tears. =The Second Boer War= When the Second Boer War broke out in October 1899, Milner rendered the military authorities \\"unfailing support and wise counsels\\", being, in Lord Roberts's phrase \\"one whose courage never faltered\\". In February 1901, he was called upon to undertake the administration of the two Boer states, both now annexed to the British Empire, though the war was still in progress. He thereupon resigned the governorship of Cape Colony, while retaining the post of high commissioner. During this time at the helm a number of concentration camps were created where 27,000 Boer women and children and more than 14,000 black South Africans died. The work of reconstructing the civil administration in the Transvaal and Orange River Colony could only be carried on to a limited extent while operations continued in the field. Milner therefore returned to England to spend a \\"hard- begged holiday,\\" which was, however, mainly occupied in work at the Colonial Office. He reached London on 24 May 1901, had an audience with Edward VII on the same day, received the GCB and was made a privy councillor, and was raised to the peerage as Baron Milner, of St James's in the County of London and of Cape Town in the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope. Speaking next day at a luncheon given in his honour, answering critics who alleged that with more time and patience on the part of Great Britain, war might have been avoided, he asserted that what they were asked to \\"conciliate\\" was \\"panoplied hatred, insensate ambition, invincible ignorance.\\" In late July Milner received the Honorary Freedom of the City of London, and gave another speech in which he defended the government policy. =The peace= Meanwhile, the diplomacy of 1899 and the conduct of the war had caused a great change in the attitude of the Liberal party in England towards Lord Milner, whom a prominent Member of Parliament, Leonard Courtney, even characterised as \\"a lost mind\\". A violent agitation for his recall was organised, joined by the Liberal Party leader Henry Campbell-Bannerman. However it was unsuccessful, and in August Milner returned to South Africa, plunging into the herculean task of remodelling the administration. He bitterly fought Lord Kitchener, who ultimately won out. However Milner drafted the terms of surrender, signed in Pretoria on 31 May 1902. In recognition of his services he was, on 15 July 1902, made Viscount Milner, of Saint James's in the County of London and of Cape Town in the Cape Colony. Around this time he became a member of the Coefficients dining club of social reformers set up in 1902 by the Fabian Society campaigners Sidney and Beatrice Webb. Milner's KindergartenColonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain & Lord Milner in South Africa On 21 June, immediately following the conclusion of signatory and ceremonial developments surrounding the end of hostilities, Milner published the Letters Patent establishing the system of Crown colony government in the Transvaal and Orange River colonies, and changing his title of administrator to that of governor. The reconstructive work necessary after the ravages of the war was enormous. He provided a steady revenue by the levying of a 10% tax on the annual net produce of the gold mines, and devoted special attention to the repatriation of the Boers, land settlement by British colonists, education, justice, the constabulary, and the development of railways. At Milner's suggestion the British government sent Henry Birchenough a businessman and old friend of Milners as special trade commissioner to South Africa with the task of preparing a Blue Book on trade prospects in the aftermath of the war. To aid him in his task, Milner recruited a team of gifted young lawyers and administrators, most of them Oxford graduates, who became known as \\"Milner's Kindergarten\\". While this work of reconstruction was in progress, domestic politics in England were convulsed by the tariff reform movement and Joseph Chamberlain's surprise resignation on 18 September 1903 due to health. Milner, who was then spending a brief holiday in Europe, was urged by Arthur Balfour to take the vacant post of secretary of state for the colonies. He declined the offer on 30 September 1903, considering it more important to complete his work in South Africa, where economic depression was becoming pronounced. Promising to stay one final year in South Africa, protege Alfred Lyttelton was chosen for the Colonial Office. As of December 1903, Milner was back in Johannesburg, pondering the crisis in the gold-mining industry caused by the shortage of native labour. Reluctantly he agreed, with the assent of the home government, to a proposal by mineowners to import Chinese coolies, each on a three-year contract. The first batch of workers reached the Rand in June 1904. In the latter part of 1904 and the early months of 1905, Milner was engaged in the elaboration of a plan to provide the Transvaal with a system of representative government, a half-way house between Crown colony administration and that of self-government. Letters patent providing for representative government were issued on 31 March 1905. For some time he had been suffering health difficulties from the incessant strain of work, and determined a need to retire, leaving Pretoria on 2 April and sailing for Europe the following day. Speaking in Johannesburg on the eve of his departure, he recommended to all concerned the promotion of the material prosperity of the country and the treatment of Dutch and British on an absolute equality. Having referred to his share in the war, he added: \\"What I should prefer to be remembered by is a tremendous effort subsequent to the war not only to repair the ravages of that calamity but to re-start the colonies on a higher plane of civilization than they have ever previously attained.\\" In all, Lord Milner made three farewell speeches, in the Transvaal on 15 March 1905, in Pretoria on 22 March 1905, and in Johannesburg on 31 March 1905. The Times also paid a great tribute to Lord Milner's achievements on 4 April 1905. He left South Africa while the economic crisis was still acute and at a time when the voice of the critic was audible everywhere but, in the words of the colonial secretary Alfred Lyttelton, he had in the eight eventful years of his administration laid deep and strong the foundation upon which a united South Africa would arise to become one of the great states of the empire. Upon returning home, his university bestowed upon him the honorary degree of DCL. Experience in South Africa had shown him that underlying the difficulties of the situation there was the wider problem of imperial unity. In his farewell speech at Johannesburg he concluded with a reference to the subject. 'When we who call ourselves Imperialists talk of the British Empire, we think of a group of states bound, not in an alliance or alliances that can be made and unmade but in a permanent organic union. Of such a union the dominions of the sovereign as they exist to-day are only the raw material.' This thesis he further developed in a magazine article written in view of the colonial conference held in London in 1907. He advocated the creation of a permanent deliberative imperial council, and favoured preferential trade relations between the United Kingdom and the other members of the empire; and in later years he took an active part in advocating the cause of tariff reform and Imperial Preference. Lord Milner was the founder of The Round Table ‚Äì A Quarterly Review of the Politics of the British Empire, which helped to promote the cause of imperial federation. It was felt that only the elite in England understood the cause of imperialism, and The Round Table's mission was to address this weakness by spreading the word to both politicians and mainstream Britons. The introduction to the journal, first published in November 1910, reads: > \\"It is a common complaint, both in Great Britain and in the Dominions, that > it is well-nigh impossible to understand how things are going with the > British Empire. People feel that they belong to an organism which is greater > than the particular portion of the King‚Äôs dominion where they happen to > reside, but which has no government, no Parliament, no press even, to > explain to them where its interests lie, or what its policy should be.

The amendment was carried by 355 votes to 135. As a result of this left-handed censure, a counter-demonstration was organised, led by Sir Bartle Frere, and a public address, signed by over 370,000 persons, was presented to Lord Milner expressing high appreciation of the services rendered by him in Africa to the Crown and empire. The censure was made by William Byles, and amended by a young parliamentarian named Winston Churchill, who added: > \\"Lord Milner has gone from South Africa, probably forever. The public > service knows him no more. Having exercised great authority he now exercises > no authority. Having held high employment he now has no employment. Having > disposed of events which have shaped the course of history, he is now unable > to deflect in the smallest degree the policy of the day.

Lord Milner has ceased to be a factor in public life.\\" The problem confronting South Africa after the Boer War was that it needed to rebuild. The country was devastated by war, its biggest natural resource were its gold mines, and reconstruction would have to come from within. The quickest and easiest way to rebuild would be with revenue from its gold mines, and labour was in short supply. The plan Lord Milner put into place he called, \\"Lift and Overspill\\".Amery, Vol I, pg. 174 This two phase process called for economic resources to be used to fill government coffers, and then for government spending and economic growth to be used to spread prosperity. The need for labour was essential if this plan was to work, and with help from Parliament, a Labour Ordinance was passed to permit the advertising and importation of Chinese labourers to fill that task. The workers were hired, they were shipped to South Africa, they lived in work camps close to the mines, and after their three year contracts expired, they were sent home. This was accepted practice in the British Empire, and in the United States as well, where Chinese coolies were imported to build the Transcontinental Railroad. Problems that occurred related to a lack of amenities, confinement in the work area, and insubordination. The Chinese workers in South Africa were no exception. They were known to run away, and to strike for higher wages. Flogging was used to deal with insubordination, and whether he knew about it at the time or not, Lord Milner accepted full responsibility for what happened, and he said it was a bad practice. Businessman Having worked closely with Cecil Rhodes in South Africa, he was appointed a trustee to Rhodes' will, upon Cecil's death in March 1902. Upon his return from South Africa, Milner occupied himself mainly with business interests in London, becoming chairman of the Rio Tinto Zinc mining company, though he remained active in the campaign for imperial free trade. In 1906 he became a director of the Joint Stock Bank, a precursor of the Midland Bank. In the period 1909 to 1911 he was a strong opponent of the budget of David Lloyd George and the subsequent attempt of the Liberal government to curb the powers of the House of Lords. Politics From a letter published in The Times on 27 May 1915, Lord Milner was asked to head the National Service League. As an advocacy group for conscription at a time when it did not exist (it did not come into effect until 01 January 1916), Milner pressed for universal conscription.The Times of London, 20 August 1915, pg. 7 His strong position forced a meeting with the King at Windsor Castle on 28 August 1915.The Times of London, 31 August 1915, pg. 9 Known as, \\"ginger group meetings\\", Lord Milner held small meetings at 17 Great College Street (owned by the National Service League) to discuss the war. On 30 September 1915, Lloyd George, then Minister of Munitions, and an advocate of conscription, attended one of these meeting. The two became friends. Lord Milner was also an outspoken critic of the Dardanelles Campaign, speaking in the House of Lords on 14 October 1915 and 8 November 1915, and suggesting a withdrawal. Starting on 17 January 1916, the ginger group attendees (Henry Wilson, Lloyd George, Edward Carson, Waldorf Astor, and Philip Kerr among others), discussed the setup of a new, small war cabinet. Lord Milner, thinking that the Liberal led Asquith Coalition could be defeated, also envisioned a new political party composed of trade workers, called, the, \\"National Party\\". Although weak on a social platform, the National Party emphasised imperial unity and citizen's service. Empowered by the ginger group, the National Party got off to a slow start in 1916, running just one candidate, but it eventually ran 23 candidates in the 1918 election. The need for a change in the administration of the war was summed up by Leo Amery who described the old war cabinet as an, \\"assembling of twenty three gentlemen without any idea of what they were going to talk about, eventually dispersing for lunch without any idea of what they had really discussed or decided, and certainly without any recollection on either point three months later\\".Amery, Vol II, pg. 93 Lord Milner's speech in the House of Lords on 19 April 1916 strengthened the conscription law, \\"making all men of military age liable of being called up to service until the war ends.\\"Bill passed by Parliament 4 May 1916 With the sinking of the Hampshire on 5 June 1916, both The Times (June 1916) and the Morning Post supported Lord Milner's replacement of Lord Kitchener at the War Office, although the job of Secretary of State for War went to Lloyd George. Bonar Law then asked Lord Milner to head the Dardanelles Inquiry Committee.Thompson, pg. 327 However, Milner had previously committed himself to supervising the government's three coal committees, at the request of Lord Robert Cecil. His report, which addressed coal production problems, was submitted on November 6th.Marlowe, pg. 250 With the governments principal internal critic, Lloyd George, now occupied with the duties of Secretary of State for War, Lord Milner was now the governments most forceful critic outside of government, and behind the scenes.Marlowe, pg. 246 The ginger group tried to convince members of the Asquith's coalition government to resign. With this, they had no luck. They then tried to take down the Asquith Coalition in a dual approach, with Lord Milner making speeches in the House of Lords, and Sir Edward Carson, who was Leader of the Opposition, making speeches in the House of Commons. The two pillars of the Asquith Coalition were Conservative, Bonar Law, and Liberal, Lloyd George. The group knew nothing about Bonar Law, but both Milner and Carson had contacts with Lloyd George, so they focused on him. On 2 December 1916, Lord Milner dined with Arthur Steel-Maitland, Chairman of the Conservative Party, where he was asked to draft a letter describing the war cabinet he envisioned. This letter was then sent to Bonar Law.Thompson, pg. 329 The next day, Lloyd George met Prime Minister Asquith, and a reconciliation deal was thought to have been reached, one that would have created a small war cabinet headed up by Lloyd George, with Prime Minister Asquith still in charge. However, The Times published an editorial on 4 December 1916, \\"Reconstruction,\\" that announced a reforming of the coalition government, and the position of Lloyd George.Wrench, Dawson and Our Times, pg. 140-141 Asquith blamed this news release on Lord Northcliffe (of the Times) and Lloyd George. He broke off future negotiations, causing both Bonar Law and Lloyd George to resign from the government. To express his disapproval, and to avoid a possibility where he might have to serve under one or the other of the two, Asquith submitted his resignation, and that of his cabinet, to the King on 6 December 1916. The King immediately summoned Bonar Law to form a government. He was unsuccessful. The King then turned to David Lloyd George, who was up to the task, and who took office the same day. On 8 December 1916, Lord Milner received a letter from Prime Minister Lloyd George, asking him to meet him, and to join the new war cabinet, which was to meet the next day at the War Office. Milner happily accepted.Wrench, Lord Milner, pg. 317 First World War Since Milner was the Briton who had the most experience in civil direction of a war, Lloyd George turned to him on 9 December 1916 when he formed his national government. He was made a member of the five-person War Cabinet. As a Minister Without Portfolio, Milner's responsibilities varied according to the wishes of the Prime Minister. Per War Cabinet Secretary Maurice Hankey: In addition to war matters, all domestic related issues pertaining to the war fell in his lap, such as negotiating contracts with miners, agriculture, and food rationing. Considering his background, as a former High Commissioner in South Africa, and a Tory intellectual leader, these other matters were not ideally suited for him. However, he remained one of Prime Minister Lloyd George's closest advisers throughout the war, second only to Bonar Law. Upon conclusion of the first war cabinet meeting on 9 December 1918, which lasted seven hours, Lloyd George got along very well with Lord Milner. He told his press contact, George Riddell, \\"He picked out the most important points at once\\", and, \\"Milner and I stand for the same things. He is a poor man and so am I. He does not represent the landed or capitalist classes any more than I do. He is keen on social reform and so am I.\\"Wrench, Lord Milner, pg. 317 To fill in the Garden Suburb (junior positions at 11 Downing Street that assisted the war cabinet), Lloyd George turned to Lord Milner, who filled vacancies with capable men from his past: Leo Amery, Waldorf Astor, Lionel Curtis and Philip Kerr. It is this connection that gave rise to rumors in quarters of the liberal press of a sinister side to Lord Milner, with long lived rumors of behind the scenes, \\"Milnerite penetration\\" influencing crucial government decision making. Lord Milner's mission to Russia. The Imperial War Cabinet in 1917. Lord Milner is seated, 2nd from the left. Following the death of Lord Kitchener aboard the HMS Hampshire on 5 June 1916, on 20 January 1917 Milner led the British delegation (with Henry Wilson as chief military representative and including a banker and two munitions experts) on a mission to Russia aboard the Kildonan Castle. There were 50 delegates in all including French (led by de Castelnau) and Italians. The object of the mission, stressed at the second Chantilly Conference in December 1916, was to keep the Russians holding down at least the forces now opposite them, to boost Russian morale and see what equipment they needed with a view to coordinating attacks. However, a feeling of doom prevailed over the meetings once it was discovered that Russia had huge equipment problems, and that England's ally operated way behind that of the west, which negated its manpower advantage. Instead of helping its ally, England's assistance was reduced to intervening with a task force to prevent allied stockpiles from falling into the hands of revolutionaries at the port of Archangel. The official report in MarchWar Cabinet Reports G-130 & 131, pgs. 300 to 311 said that even if the Tsar was toppled‚Äîwhich in fact happened just 13 days after Milner's return‚ÄîRussia would remain in the war and that they would solve their \\"administrative chaos\\". In fact, the Russian Revolution continued until 1923, when the forces loyal to the Tsar, the White Movement, were finally defeated. It was Milner's idea to create an Imperial War Cabinet, similar to that of the War Cabinet in London, which comprised the heads of government of Britain's major colonies. The Imperial War Cabinet was an extension of Lord Milner's imperial vision of Britain, whereby the Dominions (her major colonies) all have an equal say in the conduct of the running of the war. The problems of Imperial Federation are encapsulated here, whereby if all of England's colonies are elevated to the same status as the mother country, her say is diluted by foreigners with different points of view.Amery, J., pg. 1001 In the closing days of the conference of 1917, the Imperial War Cabinet decided to postpone the writing of an Imperial Constitution until after the war. This was a task it never took up. Due to the submarine blockade and the Kaiser's attempt to starve the English in early 1917, Lord Milner assisted the Royal Agricultural Society in procuring 5,000 Fordson tractors for the ploughing and planting of grasslands, and communicated directly with Henry Ford by telegraph. It is said that without the aid, England may not have met its food crisis. Milner became Lloyd George's firefighter in many crises and one of the most powerful voices in the conduct of the war. He also gradually became disenchanted with the military leaders whose offensives generated large casualties for little apparent result, but who still enjoyed support from many politicians. He backed Lloyd George, who was even more disenchanted with the military, in successful moves to remove the civilian and military heads of the Army and Navy: The Earl of Derby as Secretary of State for War, General William Robertson as head of the Army, Sir Edward Carson as First Lord of the Admiralty, and Admiral John Jellicoe as head of the Navy. With the former, the problem was Robertson's inability agree to an allied command structure set up in Versailles, France, and with the latter it was Jellicoe's refusal to organize ships into convoys to reduce the threat from submarines. Infamously, Admiral Jellicoe received his orders on Christmas Eve, 1917. On at least one occasion the conservative Milner came to the aid of people from the other end of the political spectrum. He was an old family friend of Margaret Hobhouse, the mother of imprisoned peace activist Stephen Henry Hobhouse‚Äîin fact, he was Stephen's proxy godfather. In 1917, when Margaret was working to get her son and other British conscientious objectors freed from prison, Milner discreetly helped, intervening with high government officials. As a result, in December 1917 more than 300 COs were released from prison on medical grounds. Milner was involved in every major policy decision taken by Prime Minister George's Government in the war, including the Flanders Offensive of 1917, which he initially opposed, along with Bonar Law and Lloyd George. Lloyd George spent much of 1917 proposing plans to send British troops and guns to Italy to assist in an Italian offensive (this did not happen in the end until reinforcements had to be sent after the Italian disaster at Caporetto in November). The War Cabinet did not insist on a halt to the Third Battle of Ypres offensive in 1917 when the initial targets were not reached and indeed spent little time discussing the matter‚Äîaround this time the CIGS General Robertson sent Haig (CinC of British forces in France) a biting description of the members of the War Cabinet, whom he said were all frightened of Lloyd George‚Äîhe described Milner as \\"a tired and dispeptic old man\\". By the end of the year Milner had become certain that a decisive victory on the Western Front was unlikely, writing to Curzon (17 October) opposing the policy of \\"Hammer, Hammer, Hammer on the Western Front\\", and had become a convinced \\"Easterner\\", wanting more effort on other fronts. As an experienced member of the War Cabinet, Milner was a leading delegate at the November 1917 Rapallo Conference in Italy that created an Allied Supreme War Council. He also attended all subsequent follow up meetings in Versailles to coordinate the war. Milner was also a chief author of the Balfour Declaration of 1917, although it was issued in the name of Arthur Balfour. He was a highly outspoken critic of the Austro-Hungarian war in Serbia arguing that \\"there is more widespread desolation being caused there (than) we have been familiar with in the case of Belgium\\". =The Doullens Conference= Statesmen of World War I. Lord Milner is seated between PM Lloyd George and Winston Churchill. Doullens town hall stained glass. Lord Milner is standing, center. On 21 March 1918 came the German Spring Offensive. For the first three days of the offensive, the War Cabinet was uncertain of the seriousness of the threat. General Petain was waiting, expecting the main assault to come in his sector of Compiegne, about 75 miles south of where the actual assault took place. Having secured victory on the Eastern Front in 1917, the Germans turned their attention to the Western Front in the winter of 1917-18 by moving their combat divisions in the east, by rail, to France. It was thought that Germany had in place over 200 divisions on the Western Front by the spring of 1918 (compared to France's 100, and England's 50). When the German's struck on March 21st, they concentrated their manpower and hit the allies at their weakest point, at the junction between the English and French lines. They were helped by a number of factors, 1) a recent redeployment of the B.E.F. to cover a 28 mile longer line on the front, 2) the lack of a central reserve of soldiers that the civilian leadership had ordered, but which the military had ignored, 3) the deployment of divisional reserves that did exist to the opposite places than where they were needed, 4) the lack of an overall allied leader, which, at a time of crisis, could cause military leaders to look out for their own interests, and not the whole, 5) the intense retraining of German infantry divisions in a new form of trench warfare called, \\"stormtrooper training\\", 6) dry weather that would have made otherwise swampy ground passable, 7) intense fog on the morning of the first two days of the assault, and 7) complete surprise. The artillery barrage commenced at 4:45am, it lasted four hours, and when it ended, the German infantry advanced through no-mans land, and right up to the trenches without being seen. They easily routed the British Fifth Army, and part of the Third Army, to its left. Within a day, they opened a gap 50 miles wide and penetrated seven miles deep. Within a week, they were half way to Paris. The allied generals were paralyzed. On March 25th, General Haig of the B.E.F. communicated an order to the French that he was slowly withdrawing to the Channel Ports, and he requested 20 French divisions to cover his right flank, to prevent German encirclement.Lloyd George War Memoirs, Vol V, pgs. 387-388 General Petain, a day earlier, ordered his Army to fall back and cover Paris. The lack of an allied leader, and the lack of reserves to plug the gap caused the generals to look out for their separate interests. As a result, the hole in the front widened, and the Germans were pouring in.ibid, pg. 389 In London, the British War Cabinet was unaware of the seriousness of the problem. On the third day of the battle, an officer was flown in from the front to describe the situation to them. From this, the tone of the war cabinet changed from assessing the war as a whole, to getting manpower to the front as fast as possible. Lord Milner wrote, \\"On March 23rd, my birthday, I received a call from the Prime Minister who wanted me to go over to France and report personally on the position of affairs there. I left the next day. On March 26th, at 8 in the morning, I drove to a meeting at Doullens, France, arriving there at 12:05pm. Immediately I met General's Haig, Petain, Foch, Pershing, their staff officers, and President Clemenceau. The front had broken wide open in front of us, threatening Paris. There was confusion in the ranks as to what to do, and who was in charge. I immediately took the general's aside, and using the powers entrusted with me as the Prime Minister's representative, I deputised General Foch, making him the Allied Commander at the front, and told him to make a stand.\\" That stand was taken at Amiens, a town with a critical railway station, that, if taken, could have divided the allies in half, driving the British into the sea, and leaving Paris and the rest of France open for defeat. When Milner returned to London, the War Cabinet gave him its official thanks. On 19 April he was appointed Secretary of State for War in place of the Earl of Derby, who had been a staunch ally of Field-Marshal Haig, and presided over the Army Council for the remainder of the war. Captain Leo Amery, who was stationed in Paris at the time, was ordered to pick Milner up at the Port of Boulogne and to drive him to Paris. He did this, and the next morning, March 25th, he drove Lord Milner to meet Prime Minister Clemenceau. Amery waited outside of Clemenceau's office. When Milner reappeared 30 minutes later, he told Amery what had happened. Clemenceau had pressed for a single command, but preferred General Petain. Milner preferred Foch, he was firm about it, and Clemenceau agreed. He then said to Amery, \\"I hope I was right. You and Henry have always told me Foch is the only big soldier.\\"Amery, Vol II, pgs. 146-147 Henry was General Henry Wilson, Lord Milner's recently installed Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), who, like Milner, was in France to assess the military situation. Although Prime Minister Clemenceau tried to set up a meeting that afternoon to finalise things, the British generals were too far away, and the meeting was postponed until the next morning, at the town hall of Doullens, France. The appointment of Ferdinand Foch had immediate consequences. Before the Doullens meeting broke up, he ordered the allied generals to make a stand, and to reconnect the front. Whatever panic that may have been underway ended. Both General Petain's and General Haig's orders were nullified by Foch's appointment. The front slowly came back together. By late July 1918, the situation had so improved that General Foch ordered an offensive. The Germans were slowly pushed back at first, until momentum gave way to the allies. This part of the war became known as the 100 Days Offensive. It ended with the Germans pushed back into Germany, and requesting an Armistice. This occurred at 11:00am, on the morning of November 11, 1918. Finally, the war was over. Lord Milner's decision is best summed up by an inscription at the front of Doullens Town Hall that reads ...\\"This decision saved France and the freedom of the world.\\" Post War Following the khaki election of December 1918, Lord Milner was appointed Colonial Secretary and, in that capacity, attended the 1919 Paris Peace Conference where, on behalf of the United Kingdom, he became one of the signatories of the Treaty of Versailles, including the \\"Orts-Milner Agreement\\" allowing to Belgium the administration of Ruanda and Urundi territories to reward the Belgo-African army (\\"Force publique\\") for its war effort which highly contributed to pushing German troops out of the future Tanganyika Territory, as in the victorious Tabora and Mahenge battles. The Peace Treaty William Orpen's famous painting of the signing of The Treaty of Versailles. Lord Milner is seated, third from the right. Due to his responsibilities at the Colonial Office, Milner travelled back and forth to France as a Paris Peace Plan Delegate. From February 1919 until the treaty signing, he made five trips to Versailles, each lasting on average one to two weeks. On May 10, 1919, he flew to Paris for the first time. The trip took two and a half hours, halving the time it took by train, boat, and car. As part of the British Empire Delegation (over 500 members of Britain's colonies and Dominions travelled to Paris), the Prime Minister asked Lord Milner and Arthur Balfour to stand in for him whenever he returned to England for political business. As Secretary of State for the Colonies, Milner was appointed to head up the Mandates Commission by the Big Four, which would decide the fate of Germany's oversea's colonies. Milner was present at an important meeting at 25 Rue Nitot, Lloyd George's flat in Paris, on June 1, 1919, when the Empire Delegation discussed Germany's counterproposals to the peace treaty. In a last minute attempt to improve the conditions imposed on Germany, Lloyd George went back to Prime Minister Clemenceau and President Wilson to ask for revisions. He told them that without substantial changes to bring the treaty closer in line with the 14 Points, England would not take part in an occupation of Germany, nor would its navy resume its blockade of Germany if it failed to sign the treaty. However, President Wilson was tired from all the hard work he had put into the original draft (all decisions and work were made at the top by the Big Four), and Prime Minister Clemenceau refused to budge on the war guilt clause and huge financial reparations, which in 2020 dollars amounted to close to a trillion dollars (and were not part of the 14 Points). In the end, minor territorial concessions were made, the most important being a reduction in the occupation of the Rhineland by the allies from 20 to 15 years. On June 16th, the allies gave an ultimatum to Germany and fixed the date of the treaty signing for the 28th. This caused a collapse of the conservative government in Germany on the 21st, and a rise of a liberal one. Two delegates were then rushed to Versailles, arriving on the 27th. When the peace treaty ceremonies commenced at 3pm on the 28th, and the German delegates entered the Hall of Mirrors, Lloyd George was unsure if they would sign or not, so he had them sign the document first. The entire ceremony took an hour, with a total of 65 plenipotentiarians signing the treaty. Lord Milner, for his part, spent the morning in session with his mandates committee (colonial possessions were resolved after the treaty signing), and motored to the Hall of Mirrors after lunch. He arrived slightly after 2pm, and he signed the treaty early. The British were the third group of delegates to sign, after the Germans and Americans, and Lord Milner was the 8th signatory to the Treaty of Versailles. He recalls the experience thus, \\"Though the occasion was such a solemn one and there was a great crowd, I thought it all singularly unimpressive.\\"Wrench, Lord Milner, pg. 360 Marshal Foch commented, \\"This is not Peace. It is an Armistice for Twenty Years.\\"Churchill, pg. 7 On thoughts of a sustainable peace, Lord Milner says: > \\"If humanity is to be saved from the nightmare of another Armageddon it will > only be by the creation of a new world-order. These million-odd words of the > Peace Treaty, with all its seals and signatures, will mean nothing if there > is not a change in heart, not only in Germany, but in all nations. The > League of Nations by which we set so much store will be reduced to impotence > if it is not backed by the moral forces of an enlightened public > opinion...\\"ibid. In May 1919, shortly after the Germans replied to the peace treaty proposals, American Peace Plan Delegate Dr. James Shotwell noted in his diary: > May 31, 1919: ‚ÄúThe day was spent mostly on the German negotiations; a hard > day‚Äôs work drafting the reply. I got the reparations committee to take up > again the question of opening the Austrian archives, and spent some of the > rest of the day on the text of the reply to the Germans, which is to be > discussed with (George) Barnes at dinner this evening.‚Äù June 1, 1919: > ‚ÄúThings have got into a very bad condition here.

We may conceivably have an > entirely new peace conference.‚ÄùShotwell, pg. 347 British War Cabinet member George Barnes noted this about Lord Milner: > ‚ÄúNo better selection could have been made as British representative when the > time came to bring about unity of command in France. He never got the > recognition due to the part he played in the proceedings at Doullens when > General Foch was appointed Generalissimo of the Allied Forces.

Certainly, there were those in England who thought that the Prime Minister should have stayed at home, and delegated the detailed task of peacemaking to subordinates. Of the allies, the French were the main obstacle to a fairer peace, so the likes of Lord Milner in charge could have been the catalyst for a permanent peace, one that would have avoided the start of Adolph Hitler‚Äôs rise to power just three months later. Last years Right until the end of his life, Lord Milner would call himself a \\"British race patriot\\" with grand dreams of a global Imperial parliament, headquartered in London, seating delegates of British descent from Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. He retired in February 1921 and was appointed a Knight of the Garter (KG) on 16 February 1921. On 26 February 1921 he married Lady Violet Georgina Gascoyne-Cecil, widow of Lord Edward Cecil, and remained active in the work of the Rhodes Trust, while accepting, at the behest of Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, the chairmanship of a committee to examine a new imperial preference tariff. His work, however, proved unsuccessful when, following an election, Ramsay MacDonald assumed the office of Prime Minister in January 1924. Death Seven weeks past his 71st birthday, Milner died at Great Wigsell, East Sussex, of sleeping sickness, soon after returning from South Africa. His viscountcy, lacking heirs, died with him. His body was buried in the graveyard of the Church of St. Mary the Virgin, in Salehurst in the county of East Sussex. Lord Milner is seated second from the left in this iconic Imperial War Cabinet picture, taken on 22 March 1917. It was his idea to create the war cabinet, which met in session for two years, in 1917 and 1918.Hankey, Vol II, pg. 657Link. It was his idea to draft the Balfour Resolution, which eventually led to the creation of the state of Israel. Link to the evidence, pgs 116 & 117\\\\. The truth about the Doullens Conference, itself a mystery until 30 March 1918, started appearing in The Times of London newspaper on 22 April 1918, followed by news stories on 13 November 1920, 8 January 1921, 14 May 1925, 16 May 1925, and 26 March 1926 (columns 3, 4 and 6). Lord Milner's report to the war cabinet can be found here (pages 407 to 423), definitive proof can be found in the war cabinet minutes of 27 March 1918 (page 396, minute 9), and a copy of the Doullens Agreement was published in The Times on 22 May 1928. Upon his appointment as Secretary of State for War, Lord Milner maintained contact with the British War Cabinet and Prime Minister Lloyd George by creating the \\"X Committee\\". This secret organization, a euphemism for \\"Executive Committee\\", consisted of four people: Lloyd George, Milner, Henry Wilson (CIGS), and Leo Amery (secretary). They met most weekday mornings, before the war cabinet sessions, to decide war policy.X Committee Minutes Following Germany's surrender, it was Lord Milner's suggestion, from Leo Amery, that a two minute moment of silence be heard on every anniversary of the armistice.Amery, Vol II, pg. 173 The eighth signatory to the Treaty of Versailles, Lord Milner is seated third from the right in William Orpen's famous Hall of Mirrors painting. He is also a signatory to the Treaty of Saint-Germain, that made peace with Austria on September 10, 1919. The town of Milnerton, South Africa is named in his honour. A dedication was made for him at Westminster Abbey on the anniversary of the Doullens Conference: Link He was lionised, along with other members of the British War Cabinet, in an oil painting, Statesmen of World War I, on display today at the National Portrait Gallery, London. Credo The Lord Milner hotel in Matjiesfontein, South Africa Found among Milner's papers was his Credo, which was published in The Times, republished as a pamphlet, and distributed to schools and other public institutions to great acclaim:Gollin, pg. 129 \\"I am a Nationalist and not a cosmopolitan .... I am a British (indeed primarily an English) Nationalist. If I am also an Imperialist, it is because the destiny of the English race, owing to its insular position and long supremacy at sea, has been to strike roots in different parts of the world. I am an Imperialist and not a Little Englander because I am a British Race Patriot ... The British State must follow the race, must comprehend it, wherever it settles in appreciable numbers as an independent community. If the swarms constantly being thrown off by the parent hive are lost to the State, the State is irreparably weakened. We cannot afford to part with so much of our best blood. We have already parted with much of it, to form the millions of another separate but fortunately friendly State. We cannot suffer a repetition of the process.\\" Link to the news story. On the South African War: \\"The Dutch can never form a perfect allegiance merely to Great Britain. The British can never, without moral injury, accept allegiance to any body politic which excludes their motherland. But British and Dutch alike could, without moral injury, without any sacrifice to their several traditions, unite in loyal devotion to an empire-state, in which Great Britain and South Africa would be partners, and could work cordially together for the good of South Africa as a member of that great whole. And so you see the true Imperialist is also the best South African.\\" From the Introduction to, 'The Times' History of the war in South Africa, Vol VI (1909). Link. Evaluation Per the Biographical Dictionary of World War I: :\\"Milner, on March 24, 1918 crossed the Channel and two days later at Doullens convinced Premier Georges Clemenceau, an old friend, that Marshal Ferdinand Foch be appointed commander in chief of the Allied armies in France.\\" Today, at the entrance to Doullens Town Hall stand two plaques, one written in French, the other in English, that say, \\"This decision saved France and the freedom of the world.\\" According to Colin Newbury: :An influential public servant for three decades, Milner was a visionary exponent of imperial unity at a time when imperialism was beginning to be called into question. His reputation exceeded his achievements: Office and honours were heaped upon him despite his lack of identification with either major political party.

It was introduced in November 1990 following public outcry after a number of high-profile scandals such as the threatened destruction of the Rose Theatre in London by developers. It replaced the earlier Circular 8/87 which was criticized for being ill-focused in both practical and geographical terms. On 23 March 2010 the Government published 'Planning Policy Statement 5:Planning and the Historic Environment'http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120919132719/www.communities.gov.uk/documents/planningandbuilding/pdf/1514132.pdf replacing and cancelling PPG16 and PPG15 which had dealt with the rest of the historic environment. What PPG 16 says The document advised that archaeological remains are a finite and irreplaceable resource and that their presence should be a material consideration in applications for new development. It accepted that development will affect archaeological deposits and that this effect must be mitigated. PPG 16 stressed the importance of the evaluation of a site for its archaeological potential in advance of development in order to inform future management decisions. This evaluation may involve non intrusive methods such as a desk-based study or archaeological geophysics and/or a more direct method such as trial trenching. Following the results of the initial evaluation, PPG 16 offered two solutions for preserving any significant archaeological deposits found to be on a development site. The first, and explicitly preferred, method involves preservation in situ whereby the archaeology is left untouched beneath a new development through methods such as adaptation of foundation design and architectural layout of the proposed new development, or by raising the level of the development with made ground so that its foundations do not reach the archaeological horizon. Where nationally important remains are encountered this method of preservation is strongly preferred. If preservation in situ is not feasible then PPG 16 permitted preservation by record. This method involves archaeological fieldwork to excavate and record finds and features (thereby destroying them). This may involve a full excavation, further trenching in specific areas or an archaeological watching brief which involves an archaeologist monitoring groundworks for the new development and recording any finds or features revealed as construction continue. PPG 16 in practice All forms of archaeological investigation undertaken through PPG 16 are funded by the developer through an extension of the Polluter Pays principle, although this is not made explicit in the document itself. The work is intended to be undertaken in advance of any planning consent being granted but often happens to satisfy a planning condition placed on an application for development, that is once the principle of development on the land has already been established. Because of the potential for destruction of significant remains, PPG 16 prefers evaluation to take place in advance of any planning decision being made. A developer tenders for the work to be done and chooses an archaeological organization to retain. The work is monitored by a curator, normally the County Archaeologist, who is nominated by the local planning authority as an adviser and who also identifies sites where archaeology might be threatened by development. Following submission of a satisfactory site report and demonstration that a site's archaeological potential has been properly safeguarded and/or recorded, the curator will usually advise that development can continue. Curators maintain a Historic Environment Record or HER, a database of known archaeological sites which is often used to inform decisions on archaeological potential. Areas of archaeological potential are often drawn on GIS maps which can indicate any potentially damaging development automatically. PPG 16 has resulted in an explosion in archaeological fieldwork in the UK. Developer funding has led to dozens of archaeological organizations competing for work along with archaeological consultants working for developers to oversee projects. This has contributed to the growing professionalization of archaeology from its more ad hoc earlier incarnation as Rescue archaeology. Also, a wider variety of archaeological methods are now employed including surveys of large areas for the purposes of Historic Landscape Characterisation, deposit models and the production of regional archaeological research agendas. Criticism of PPG 16 and its effects Critics of PPG 16 argue that the commercialization of UK archaeology has resulted in more work of lower quality being undertaken, and that a shortage of county archaeologists to monitor this work allows consultants to exploit the situation. In recent years prices have been driven down by competing consultants who have unethical arrangements with archaeological contractors, who rather than performing the same job for a lower cost (as in true competitive tendering) are able to do a worse job. The increased volume of work has led to a backlog of unpublished site reports and homeless site archives awaiting resolution. The competition for work amongst archaeologists, and the fact that the developers funding them see no real use for their final product, also tends to drive prices down meaning that wages and conditions for archaeologists in the UK are generally far below the national average for equivalent professions with comparable levels of education. The irony is that the cost of this unworthy body of work, known as \\"grey archaeology\\", borne by the construction industry benefits nobody but the consultants who have something to \\"mitigate\\" on behalf of their clients in the construction industry. PPG 16 was only guidance to planners and did not have the full force of law. Its precepts could only be enforced through the Town and Country Planning Act and ultimate decisions on its implementation rested with the Secretary of State. However, without full legal status it lacked the power and reach of measures safeguarding similar environmental issues which are enshrined in law, such as those concerning endangered species. The theory of PPG 16 Theoretically, the philosophical approach of PPG 16 was strongly based on processualism, especially following the publication of the de facto guidance manual for UK developer-led archaeology, English Heritage's Management of Archaeological Projects (1991), popularly known as MAP 2. This stressed the importance of evaluation, documentation and decision-making at each stage of a project based on empirical evidence and valid hypotheses. From 2006 MAP2 was replaced by a more generic project management approach for the sector \\"Management of Research Projects in the Historic Environment\\" (MoRPHE) with a specific guidance \\"Project Planning Note 3\\" (MoRPHE PPN3) covering archaeological excavation. MoRPHE PPN3 retained the staged approach, with evaluation as a quality assessment technique that was applicable at any stage during an investigation. Associated guidance and the future A similar, though less stringent, guideline to PPG 16 exists for historic buildings and the wider historic environment called PPG 15. As of 2004 both documents are proposed to be combined into a single piece of guidance called a Planning Policy Statement.

While theologically diverse within the evangelical community, NRB members are linked through a Declaration of Unity that proclaims their joint commitment and devotion to Christianity. Membership Members of the association are required to ascribe to the Statement of Faith and adhere to the NRB Code of Ethics. NRB members must also meet the Standards of Financial Accountability set forth by the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability (ECFA). History Evangelical broadcaster William Ward Ayer (far right), who would later become the first president of the National Religious Broadcasters, stands before a congregation during an altar call at New York's Calvary Baptist Church. The altar call was carried live by radio. In the early 1940s in America, the emerging culture of hostility between so- called mainline Protestant denominations and the rapidly growing Evangelical Christian movement reached a crisis phase in the world of radio broadcasting. Protestant denominational leaders argued for regulations that would restrict access to the radio broadcast spectrum. They claimed independent Evangelical preachers who were unaccountable to any denominational entity could not be trusted with the public airwaves.Hangen, Tona J. Redeeming the Dial: Radio, Religion and Popular Culture in America (Raleigh, N.C.: University of North Carolina Press, 2002) In those early years of radio broadcasting, pioneer Evangelical broadcasters like William Ward Ayer, Paul Rader, Donald Grey Barnhouse, Walter Maier, and Charles Fuller had built radio audiences in the millions and were faithfully proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ. By 1942 The Lutheran Hour was receiving more mail than the well-known Amos 'n Andy radio program, and The Old Fashioned Revival Hour was the largest program on the Mutual Broadcasting System, purchasing 50% more airtime than the next largest secular broadcaster. In that same year, the Mutual Broadcasting System received more than 25% of its total revenue from religious broadcasters.Armstrong, Ben. the Electric Church (New York: Thomas Nelson Publishers, 1979), p.38. Yet in 1943, the Federal Council of Churches (later renamed the National Council of Churches) supported proposed regulations that would have resulted in every Evangelical broadcaster being taken off the national radio networks. They demanded that religious broadcasting should only be aired as a public service during free or \\"sustaining\\" time donated by the radio networks. They further argued that these public service slots should only be allocated to \\"responsible\\" religious broadcasters that had been approved by local and national denominational councils ‚Äì like themselves.Finke, Roger, and Rodney Stark. The Churching of America, 1776‚Äì1990: Winners and Losers in Our Religious Economy (Rutgers University Press, 1992), p. 219. The Federal Council of Churches persuaded all three national radio networks ‚Äì NBC, CBS, and the Mutual Broadcasting System ‚Äì to adopt the proposed regulations. Subsequently, every Evangelical Christian broadcaster was taken off the national radio networks, with their only access being small independent stations with a very limited audience.Davidson, James D., and Ralph E. Pyle. Ranking Faiths: Religious Stratification in America (Rowman and Littlefield Publishers, 2011), p. 107. Evangelist Billy Graham speaks at the NRB convention, 1977 In response to this challenge, 150 Evangelical Christian broadcasters and church leaders held a series of meetings which led to the formation of the National Religious Broadcasters (NRB). In the fall of 1944, members of the NRB adopted their Constitution, Bylaws, Statement of Faith, and Code of Ethics. J. Gordon Melton, Phillip Charles Lucas, Jon R. Stone, Prime-time Religion: An Encyclopedia of Religious Broadcasting, Oryx Press, USA, 1997, p. 383 And thus began a multi-year effort by NRB to build credibility for Evangelical broadcasters, to secure available public interest slots, and to overturn the ban on the purchase of radio airtime for religious broadcasting.Mark Ward, Sr., Air of Salvation: The Story of Christian Broadcasting, Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Books, 1994. In 1949 the newly formed ABC radio network reversed the ban on paid religious broadcasting, with the other networks following their lead. In a few years, Evangelical radio broadcasters were again on major radio networks with scores of new programs. The NRB now operates in a more complex electronic media environment, while retaining its original focus of defending and expanding access to electronic media platforms for Christian evangelism. And the audience for religious broadcasters has expanded, with 141 million Americans using Christian media at least once per month.christian mass media reach more adults with the christian message than do churches. Barna.org Governance NRB members elect a Board of Directors and five Officers for the association. The five Officers, along with five Members-At-Large elected from the Board of Directors, form an Executive Committee that governs the association.

It initially aired on ITV in the mornings from 1998 to 2004 before moving to Channel 5, where it was broadcast until 2010. It was also shown on ITV's digital channel ITV2 with a spin-off show called Trisha: Extra and a double bill of the main Trisha show every afternoon. The programme was moved to Channel 5 and aired from January 2005 to December 2010. Format The show started and ended taking over from Vanessa Feltz and the Vanessa show. Initially, Trisha Goddard continued her predecessor's tradition of light-hearted debate, on subjects such as men who wore women's clothes. Goddard would also interview ordinary people in the news. However, from around 2001 the show began modelling itself on The Jerry Springer Show, which at the time had a following in the UK. More and more, Trisha began to focus on working-class or underclass guests and their numerous problems. These were usually to do with infidelity and/or paternity issues, but other subjects covered included troublesome teenagers or surprise family reunions. Goddard hosts the programme, which is well known for the conducting of lie detector tests and DNA tests, the results of which are then revealed on air. Robert Phipps, a body language expert, frequently guests on the show. Trisha has frequently been accused of exploiting its subjects plus copying American formats such as The Maury Povich Show. Verbal abuse and physical fights between guests sometimes break out on the show, the latter are never shown. Instead the camera cuts to the audience or Trisha herself until her security team restores order. Dispute Trisha ceased production in 2004, when ITV refused to allow Trisha's own TV production company, Town House TV, to make future episodes of the show. She decided not to renew her contract and moved to rival broadcaster Channel 5 to present a similar series. The new programme, Trisha Goddard, was made by Town House TV. ITV mounted a successful spoiler campaign against Trisha's new series; they stockpiled their remaining episodes of Trisha until the launch date of Trisha Goddard. When ITV finally ran out of Trisha episodes, Channel 5 began running Trisha Goddard. From 16 October 2006, it has been seen on both Channel 5 and then in a double-bill on its new female-oriented digital channel Fiver (formerly Five Life). Trisha Goddard launched on Channel 5 on Monday 24 January 2005, but it was shown in the afternoons and not directly opposite ITV's series. ITV did, however, schedule a double bill of Trisha on ITV2 to clash with the series on Channel 5. The first Trisha Goddard gained 500,000 viewers on Channel 5, significantly fewer than the 1.3 million viewers who watched ITV's show. Trisha took some of her \\"experts\\" with her to Channel 5, including counsellor advisor on Aftercare for show and Psychological factors Ricky Maczka, Robert Phipps and head security guard Pete. Others, such as counsellor Claire Evans and polygraph expert Bruce Burgess, stayed with ITV to work on its successor show, The Jeremy Kyle Show. The show production base was moved from the ITV Anglia studios in Norwich to The Maidstone Studios in Kent. On 9 January 2009, Channel 5 announced that Trisha Goddard had been cancelled. The channel blamed the \\"current economic climate\\" for the \\"difficult decision\\". Trisha: Extra Trisha: Extra was a spin-off show shown on ITV's digital channel ITV2. U.S. version In July 2011, it was announced that NBCUniversal Television Distribution will bring Goddard to the United States to launch an American version of her program, which would follow the same concept as her UK version.\\"NBCU Working With Trisha Goddard, Jenny McCarthy on New Talkers\\" from Broadcasting & Cable (29 July 2011).

Material considerations in the past have included issues regarding traffic, wildlife, economic impacts and the historical interest of the area. In considering an application for development, decision makers often consult local development plans and Planning Policy Guidance Notes to determine the success of a proposal. Issues such as loss of a view, or effect on property values are not material considerations. The Campaign to Protect Rural England advises that Material Considerations are factors that will be taken into account when a decision on a planning application or appeal is reached. Under Section 38 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, decisions on planning applications 'must be made in accordance with the [development] plan unless other material considerations indicate otherwise'. The courts ultimately decide what a material consideration is. However, case law gives local planning authorities a great deal of leeway to decide what considerations are relevant and how much weight should be given to them, each time they make a decision on a planning application. Any consideration that relates to the use or development of land is capable of being a material consideration, but other circumstances such as personal hardship and fears of affected residents can be considered in exceptional cases (the House of Lords in Great Portland Estates v. Westminster City Council [1985]). In practice, government planning policy is often the most important material consideration other than the development plan. Government policy may also override the development plan if it has been both consulted on and published more recently.

Sited on the main route South from Glasgow to Carlisle, both Kirkmuirhill and Blackwood benefited from the traffic passing through although by far the largest employer in this largely rural area in the 18th and early 19th centuries would have been the Blackwood Estate. Blackwood was (arguably) originally the farming cousin to other local villages, where coal mining was the dominant industry. Blackwood estate provided farming work for local families. The Blackwood Estate, seat of the Weir de Veres since the thirteenth century, afterwards the Hope-Veres, was the most extensive estate in the parish of Lesmahagow'Irving, George Vere. The Upper Ward of Lanarkshire. Glasgow: T. Murray and Son, 1864.; also The Farmer's Magazine, July 1880, page 281 and by some accounts the largest estate in the County of Lanark. =Isabella Burns= Gilbert Burns, brother of the poet had been the land steward at Blackwood before moving to Morham Mains in East Lothian. In 1810 John Begg, husband of Robert Burns youngest sister Isabella Burns, became the land steward for Mr James Hope Vere MP on his estate at Blackwood.Begg, Page 27Begg, Page 21 On 24 April 1813, after nearly three years at Blackwood, John met his death when his horse reared and fell on him, crushing him to death. He was returning from his regular trip to Lesmahagow market on a horse that he had been asked to ride because it had become fractious due to lack of exercise.Begg, Page 28 Isabella was left a widow with nine children with ages from three to eighteen. For a while Mr James Hope Vere paid her a small annual grant however to make ends meet she opened a dame's school in Kirkmuirhill which she ran for four yearsBegg, Page 29 before moving to Ormiston.  Railway station  The arrival of the railways into the area in 1856 with the opening of the station at Blackwood, resulted in an expansion of mining but the deep pits in the immediate vicinity seem to have had a short lifespan and were worked out fairly rapidly. Surface mining lasted a little longer but by the mid-20th century, mining was no longer a major employment option in the region.  Blackwood today  Despite this the two villages of Blackwood and Kirkmuirhill seem to have proved pleasant places to live and both enjoyed a major building boom during the 20th century. In 1901 Blackwood had 167 houses and Kirmuirhill 121. By the year 2000 they had a combined total of 1480 and the villages had merged such that it is hard to tell where one ends and the other begins. More recently, a holy grail novel has been inspired by the village of Blackwood. Based on a true story which follows the descendants of the holy bloodline from France in 1066 to South Lanarkshire, where the grail treasure is believed to be buried.  Economic development  = Wind turbines = Junction 9 of the M74 motorway brings visitors to the South end of the village, but the more popular B7078 links the village with Junction 8 (Canderside Toll) and the larger town of Larkhall. In 2009 three large wind turbines went operational along the B7078, providing power for around 3,000 homes and part of Scotland's growing commitment to renewable energy production. = Blackwood and Kirkmuirhill community = Blackwood and Kirkmuirhill Community Hall is located on the main road (B7078) through the village and was opened in October 2012. The hall is incorporated within the Blackwood and Kirkmuirhill Community Wing which adjoins Blackwood Primary School. Blackwood and Kirkmuirhill Community Wing is run by South Lanarkshire Leisure and Culture. This facility has a gym, community hall, sports hall and library and there Is also a pub called The Kirkmuirhill Inn.

He was affectionately known as Onze Jan, \\"our Jan\\" in Dutch.  Life  He was born in Cape Town, educated at the South African College, and at an early age turned his attention to politics, first as a journalist. He was editor of de Zuid-Afrikaan until its incorporation with Ons Land, and of the Zuid Afrikaansche Tijdschrift. By birth, education and sympathies a typical Dutch Afrikaner, he set himself to organize the political power of his fellow-countrymen. This he did very effectively, and when in 1879 he entered the Cape parliament as member for Stellenbosch, he became the real leader of the Dutch party. Yet he only held office for six months ‚Äî as minister without portfolio in the Scanlen ministry from May to November 1881. He held no subsequent official post in the colony, though he shared with Sir Thomas Upington and Sir Charles Mills the honor of representing the Cape at the intercolonial conference of 1887. Here he supported the proposal for entrusting the defence of Simon's Town to Cape Colony, leaving only the armament to be provided by the imperial government, opposed trans-oceanic penny postage and moved a resolution in favor of an imperial customs union. At the Colonial Conference of 1894 at Ottawa he was again one of the Cape representatives. In 1888 and in 1889, he was a member of the South African customs conference. His chief importance as a public man was, however, derived from his power over the Dutch in Cape Colony, and his control of the Afrikaner Bond. But it remained an organization for obtaining the political supremacy of the Cape Dutch. His control over the Bond enabled him for many years, while free from the responsibilities of office, to make and unmake ministers at his will, and earned for him the name of Cabinet-maker of South Africa. His preference for working behind the scenes and avoiding overt political stands earned him another nickname, \\"the Mole\\" (described by John X Merriman as \\"an industrious little animal . . . You never see him at work, but every now and then a little mound of earth, thrown up here or there, will testify to his activities.\\") Although officially the term Afrikander was explained by Hofmeyr to include white men of whatever race, yet in practice the influence of the Bond was always exerted in favor of the Dutch, and its power was drawn from the Dutch districts of Cape Colony. The sympathies of the Bond were thus always strongly with the Transvaal, as the chief centre of Dutch influence in South Africa; and Hofmeyr's position might in many respects be compared with that of Parnell at the head of the Irish Nationalist party in Great Britain. In the Bechuanaland difficulty of 1884 Hofmeyr threw all the influence of the Bond into the scale in favor of the Transvaal. But in the course of the next few years he began to drift away from President Kruger. He resented the reckless disregard of Cape interests involved in Kruger's fiscal policy; he feared that the Transvaal, after its sudden leap into prosperity upon the gold discoveries of 1886, might overshadow all other Dutch influences in South Africa; above all he was convinced, as he showed by his action at the London conference, that the protection of the British navy was indispensable to South Africa, and he set his face against Kruger's intrigues with Germany, and his avowed intention of acquiring an outlet to the sea in order to get into touch with foreign powers. Church Square, Cape Town In 1890, Hofmeyr joined forces with Cecil Rhodes, who became premier of Cape Colony with the support of the Bond. Hofmeyr's influence was a powerful factor in the conclusion of the Swaziland convention of 1890, as well as in stopping the trek to Banyailand (Rhodesia) in 1891, a notable reversal of the policy he had pursued seven years before. But the reactionary elements in the Bond grew alarmed at Rhodes's imperialism, and in 1895 Hofmeyr resigned his seat in parliament and the presidency of the Bond. Then came the Jameson Raid, and in its wake there rolled over South Africa a wave of Dutch and anti-British feeling such as had not been known since the days of Majuba. (The proclamation issued by Sir Hercules Robinson disavowing Jameson was suggested by Hofmeyr, who helped to draw up its terms.) Once more Hofmeyr became president of the Bond. By an alteration of the provincial constitution, all power in the Cape branch of the Bond was vested in the hands of a vigilance committee of three, of whom Hofmeyr and his brother were two. As the recognized leader of the Cape Dutch, he protested against such abuses as the dynamite monopoly in the Transvaal, and urged Kruger even at the eleventh hour to grant reasonable concessions rather than plunge into a war that might involve Cape Afrikanderdom and the Transvaal in a common ruin. In July 1899, he journeyed to Pretoria, and vainly supported the proposal of a satisfactory franchise law, combined with a limited representation of the Uitlanders in the Volksraad, and in September urged the Transvaal to accede to the proposed joint inquiry. He died in London on 11 October 1909.  Family  Hofmeyr married Aleda Hendrikz in 1880; she died 1883. He married her sister, Johanna Hendrikz on 1 September 1900.

The National Educational Debate Association (NEDA) is an American collegiate debate association emphasizing audience-centered debate. It was founded by debate educators who believe that the debate tournament is an extension of the communication classroom and that even competitive debates should provide students with skills of research, argument selection, and presentation style that will benefit them as public advocates. NEDA schedules eight invitational tournaments a year, primarily in the mid-west. The association debates two resolutions per year. The fall resolution is one of value, and the spring resolution is one of policy. Several aspects of NEDA make it distinct from other debate organizations, including the ability to decide topicality at the end of the constructive speeches, the ability of judges to give \\"double losses\\" in those cases in which neither team argues in a manner consistent befitting a public advocate, closed cross examination, and a focus on argumentation and delivery. Also, half of all tournament judges are 'lay judges' - that is, they are not debate coaches. Membership in NEDA is awarded to individuals, not institutions, and all members must apply and be approved the governing body. The intended focus is on the clash over the issues central to the debate proposition. The debate is similar to Public Forum debate in that it is audience-friendly, but is more formal, and more evidence-based.  History  NEDA began in the fall of 1994 at the Central States Communication Association convention in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. About thirty debate educators and their institutions left the Cross Examination Debate Association (CEDA) because they felt CEDA tournaments were no longer conducive to the audience-centered debate to which they were philosophically committed and desired to teach their students. The resulting organization was co-founded by Gary Horn, professor at Ferris State University, and Larry Underberg, then a professor at the University of South Dakota. There were quickly nineteen other founding members of the association. In 1999, the Western division of NEDA became the Great Plains Forensic Conference. Divisions Teams in NEDA compete in one of three categories: * Novice - Standard cross-examination format of debate for competitors who have participated in six or fewer tournaments ever (including high school). * Open - Standard cross-examination format debate for debaters who have competed at six or more tournaments. * Crossfire Debate - Developed from Ted Turner style televised debates, this format is more interactive, involves more cross- examination, and emphasizes succinct arguments that get to the heart of the issues quickly.

The materials he provided facilitated Polish mathematician Marian Rejewski's reconstruction of the wiring in the Enigma's rotors and reflector; thereafter the Poles were able to read a large proportion of Enigma-enciphered traffic. Selling Enigma secrets , born Rudolf Stallmann (1871‚Äì1946) A former officer, Schmidt had been forced to leave the army having suffered from gas during the First World War.May, Ernest Strange Victory, New York: Hill & Wang, 2000 page 135. However, his brother, Rudolf Schmidt, secured him a civilian post at the German Armed Forces' cryptographic headquarters, the Cipher Office.May, Ernest Strange Victory, New York: Hill & Wang, 2000 page 135. Shortly after the military version of the Enigma machine was introduced, he contacted French intelligence and offered to supply information about the new machine. His offer was accepted by Captain Gustave Bertrand of French Intelligence, and he received from the French the codename Asch√©, and was assigned a contact, the French agent codenamed Rex. For the next several years, until he left his position in Germany, he met with French agents at various European cities and supplied them copies of the Enigma machine's instruction manual, operating procedures, and lists of key settings. Even with this information, however, French Intelligence was unable to break messages encrypted on the Enigma. Nor were the British cryptologists whom Bertrand contacted able to make any headway. In December 1932, Bertrand shared intelligence obtained from Asch√© with the Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau (Biuro Szyfr√≥w). Mathematician-cryptologist Marian Rejewski had already set up a system of equations describing the operation of the then new German Army Enigma rotor-wirings. The key-settings lists provided by Schmidt helped fill in enough of the unknowns in Rejewski's formulae, allowing him to speedily solve the equations and recover the wirings. That accomplished, the Poles were henceforth able to read Enigma traffic for nearly seven years to the outbreak of World War II as well as for a time into the War, while operating in conjunction with French intelligence in France. In a two-week January 1938 trial, they solved and read about three-quarters of all Wehrmacht (German Armed Forces) Enigma intercepts: a remarkable result, considering that parts of the raw intercepts were garbled or incomplete due to interference [Kozaczuk, Enigma 1984, p. 45]. After the Battle of France, the French agent who had been Schmidt's case officer, a German citizen named Stallmann who went by the name \\"Rodolphe Lemoine\\" (fr) and used the codename \\"Rex,\\" was arrested by the Gestapo and betrayed Schmidt as a French spy. Schmidt was arrested on 1 April 1943, and in September 1943 his daughter Giselle was called on to identify his body; her account (as recounted in Hugh Sebag-Montefiore's book) suggests that Schmidt may have committed suicide.

It stands above the Wear Valley about south of Durham. The town was founded over 160 years ago. The Town Council area, which includes the villages of Kirk Merrington, Middlestone Moor, Byers Green and Tudhoe, has a population of about 20,000. History The arms of the Town Council include a motto inspired by the name Spennymoor: SPE NEMO RUET (meaning \\"With hope, no one shall fail\\") =Origins= The land on which Spennymoor now stands was once a vast expanse of moorland covered with thorn and whin bushes (Spenny Moor). In 1336 its place-name was recorded as Spendingmor. The name is probably derived from the Old English or Old Norse spenning and m≈çr, meaning a moor with a fence or enclosure. Another theory of the place-name's origin is from the Latin spina, meaning thorn (possibly from the Roman influence at Binchester) combined with the Old English or Old Norse m≈çr. CE Jackson, in his Place Names of Durham published in 1916 suggested a combination of the Old Norse spaan with Old English mar, meaning the moor named after the shingle-hut erected thereon. Neither Britons nor Romans cultivated the moor, but on the site of Binchester, a village about to the southwest, the Romans built a camp around which grew up the settlement of Vinovium. The name Binchester is the usual Old English corruption or adaptation of the Roman site name. This fortress must have been of great strength, for it stood on a height above the River Wear; many coins, urns, altars and pieces of Roman pottery have been found, as well as the remains of a hypocaust of the heating system. Later, Binchester became one of the \\"vills\\" of the Earl of Northumberland who held it until 1420 when it passed to the Nevilles who finally forfeited it with other lands in 1569. As is to be expected, the moor itself offers little of historical interest but it is linked with the records of Kirk Merrington, Whitworth Old Park, Binchester, Byers Green and Tudhoe, all of which form a part of the early days of Spennymoor. All these villages had common rights on the moor but, as it became denuded by increasing flocks, some of the local people were induced to relinquish their rights and so, gradually, the common became the property of just one owner ‚Äì Merrington Priory. The Manor of Merrington belonged successively to the priors, monks and dean and chapter of Durham Cathedral. Today, Merrington church is one of the most prominent local landmarks. It was originally built by the Normans and its splendid strategic position led to it being fortified in 1143 by the Scots intruder, William Cumyn. When he was finally attacked and overcome, the church roof was destroyed but the building remained as one of the most interesting Norman churches in the county until 1850 when it was almost wholly rebuilt ‚Äì although retaining the form of its predecessor. Inside, the most interesting feature is the screen, a typical example of late-17th century work. =Troubled years= The Norman Conquest meant little to the border folk at first, for they had lived with the constant threat of massacre by raiding Picts and Danes, but then William's soldiers \\"laid waite\\" the county and distributed the Saxon nobles' estates among themselves. however, William allowed some of the previous owners to retain their lands, and one of these was Whittleworth ‚Äì now Whitworth ‚Äì whose first known proprietor was Thomas de Acle who held it in 1183. Nevertheless, the whole of this countryside was made desolate by William's soldiers, and for many years it was the haunt of outlaws and wild animals. On 16 October 1346 David of Scotland was encamped with a great army on the hills near Durham, and raiding bands under a Douglas had been terrorising the neighbourhood. Edward lll was otherwise engaged at Crecy in France at the time, but his Queen, Phillipa, with the Archbishop of York, the Bishops of Durham, Lincoln and Carlisle, and the Lords Neville and Percy and others marched North, and with an array of 16,000 men, moved along the ridge from Auckland to Merrington. Her advance guards clashed with some of Douglas' men near Ferryhill and chased them back to the bridge at Croxdale (Sunderland Bridge). Butchers Race, one of the Five Lanes which meet at Tudhoe Crossroads, was so named after this foray. The next day the main bodies of the two armies met at Neville's Cross, near Durham, and the Scots were slaughtered. During the battle, the prior from Durham and his monks knelt on a little hillock in the Shaw Wood and prayed for an English victory while holding aloft, impaled on a spear, the Holy Corporax Cloth from the Cathedral. In 1420 the Manor of Whitworth and much of the other land in the vicinity, from Raby to Brancepeth, and including Old Park, Byers Green, Newfield and Tudhoe, became Neville property, and the Earl of Westmorland (a Neville) was granted a licence from Bishop Langley to impark 40 acres at Whitworth, and so began the Whitworth park of today. The moor itself comes into the record in 1615 as the result of \\"a general muster on the moor of all men able to bear arms within the bishopric, between the ages of 15 and 60; the gathering amounted to 8,320\\" (Fordyce). Some military training seems to have been given, doubtless with a view to the then unsettled state of the country due to the growing tension between Parliament and the King. Quite a few of these men must have been miners, as at that time \\"coale pits\\" were being worked at Whitworth, Byers Green and Fernhill. In 1677 the small freeholders and the local gentry divided 243 acres of the moor between themselves, an act which was confirmed by the Chancery Court. The only portion of the common that was left was a small plot reserved for the use of a spring of water. =The rise of industry= Up to 1800 the moor remained largely barren and the few roads across it were dangerous. The one good road was maintained by tolls collected at turnpike gates. Some of the largest horse- race meetings in the North took place on the moor, and miners and their families attended in all their holiday splendour. These men, early industrial workers, wore their hair long and on these gala days it flowed freely over their shoulders instead of, as usually was the case, being tied in curls. Floral waistcoats and ribboned hats were worn on these highly colourful occasions. Modern Spennymoor was built on mining and has its origins with the sinking of the Wittered pit in 1839. Rough houses were built for the pit workers ‚Äì houses with two rooms and a loft, more like \\"piggeries than human habitation\\" according to Dodd. The first coal from Merrington Colliery was brought up in 1841; a pit with a chequered career which only prospered under the partnership of L.M Reay and R.S. Johnson, who made a fortune out of it. The trade depression of the late 19th century, however, caused its closure in 1882. The coal mining at Whitworth and a small foundry at Merrington Lane were the earliest industries, but in 1853 the Weardale Iron and Coal Company opened its great ironworks at Tudhoe. As a result, many hundreds of immigrant workers came here from the Midlands and more rows of dark little houses were erected. More workers came ‚Äì from Wales and Lancashire ‚Äì with the opening of the mine at Page Bank (ten lives were lost in a pit fire here in 1858), and with the sinking of a new pit at Tudhoe in the 1880s. The latter resulted in colliery workers' houses springing up on the main Durham road. Slightly before that, in the 1860s, a rather advanced area of working-class housing had been erected at Tudhoe Grange ‚Äì built by Marmaduke Salvin to house local workers. These houses were, unusually, semi-detached and arranged in a chequerboard layout, very much in contrast to the dreary terraces that were then the standard. Although these days of rapid industrialisation and rapid growth of population were days of ignorance and squalor, they also saw the 19th century drive for education and religion. A National School was built and opened in 1841; St.Paul's Church was built at Spennymoor in 1858 and all through these formative years the Non- conformist churches combined welfare work with prayer. An era of prosperity dawned in the 1860s and 1870s when the miners were earning ¬£1 per day. Spennymoor was ringed with collieries, black furnaces and coke ovens and the new prosperity showed itself in the building of better houses and in the opening of Co-operative stores. The comparative isolation of its moorland situation ended too with the opening of a branch railway from the mainline at Ferryhill in 1876. However, as always in industrial life, boom was followed by \\"bust\\" ‚Äì or \\"near bust\\", and by 1879 miners' wages were down to 4s 9d a day and those of ironworkers to a mere 3s a day. On top of these economic misfortunes came the terrible explosion at Tudhoe Colliery in 1882 when 37 lives were lost. A strike, which lasted 13 weeks, paralysed the area in 1892, although out of the enforced idleness came foundations of new growth, for the machinery at the Tudhoe Iron works was then renovated and a new mill laid down. The works then possessed the largest mill in Europe, capable of rolling plates up to 13 feet in width. =Into the 20th century= When, in 1894, Spennymoor and its adjacent villages achieved a measure of self-government on the Spennymoor Urban District Council, the new authority found itself facing a legacy of poor housing. With few exceptions, the housing situation was little better than when Dodd had described the houses as \\"more like piggeries\\". In 1874 the then Local Government Board had reported: \\"Nothing could well exceed the nuisance attendant on the disposal of excrement and refuse in Spennymoor. There are entire streets without any closet accommodation whatever and in its stead open wooden boxes are placed opposite nearly every doorway for the reception of the excrement, ashes and other refuse; an arrangement which, besides being revolting to every sense of decency, is stated to be offensive in the extreme, especially in hot weather. It is impossible to walk between the rows of cottages without being convinced that the surface of the ground is to a large extent composed of the overflowing contents of these midden boxes. The back streets stand deep in filth and mud.\\" These appalling conditions continued into the 20th century and even by 1920 fewer than 10% of the town houses had water closets. In 1923 only four houses were built and there was still massive overcrowding in back to back properties. In the next few years only between one and four houses were built in any year and in 1929 the housing situation was still reported as acute which, from the recorded facts, seems self-evident. These squalid conditions were paralleled by the ever- uncertain economic conditions in industry. Although coal-mining continued and the ironworks and engineering businesses were also providing employment, the start of the 20th century saw the start, too, of a long period of depression. The first blow was the closure in 1901 of the ironworks which had been rendered obsolete by the pace of change elsewhere. The effect of the closure was relieved by the sinking of the Dean and Chapter colliery in 1904, but the reliance on this one basic industry was to persist until the 1960s. Even before the big coal strike of 1926 the collieries had begun to close. Three closed in 1924 and the strike saw another two fail. Spennymoor became part of the South West Durham depressed area. Although schemes were inaugurated to relieve the gloom nothing could make up for the lack of steady employment. In 1930 the coke ovens which remained on the ironworks site were only working intermittently. Even by 1938 the situation had improved little. The Cleveland iron trade, which used the coal and coke produced at Spennymoor, was depressed. The production of these raw materials at Coulson's engineering works, Kenmir's furniture factory and newly opened brickworks at Todhills were the main, if limited, sources of employment. Unemployment was over 33%. =Brighter days= Despite the high levels of unemployment, the housing situation at last took an upturn in the 1930s when the Urban District Council began to use its wider powers to take action on unfit houses. By 1935 the first 66 Council houses had been built, and a year later the first 106 North Eastern Housing Association houses were erected on the Racecourse Estate site. Although these were the only houses built before the war, they did provide some hope and allowed the clearance of some of the worst of the squalid areas. Nevertheless, the situation remained bad and there were still far too many damp, badly lit and ventilated houses opening onto small paved yards or back streets. World War II had diverse effects upon the town. On the one hand it brought housing efforts almost to a standstill, but on the industry front it saw the resurgence of Spennymoor as a major centre. The main factor was the opening in 1941 of a Royal Ordnance Factory at Merrington Lane and since then this estate has provided a constant source of alternative employment to the coal industry. The end of World War II, however, saw this industrial activity greatly curtailed and hard times returned, although without the severity of the earlier pre-war years. The run-down of the mining industry, however, was nevertheless a serious blow. On 24 December 1944, Tudhoe's cricket ground was hit by a rogue V-1 flying bomb, which had been air-launched by a German Heinkel He 111 and was aimed at Manchester. The explosion cratered the field and blew out the windows of surrounding houses and of St. Charles' Church. This was the furthest north any V-1 landed during World War II. In 1963 changes were indicated and Durham County Council and then Ministry of Housing and Local Government agreed that Spennymoor should be a new \\"growth point\\" and that town centre redevelopment should take place; that the Tudhoe ironworks site should be reclaimed; that a major highway scheme should be put into hand; that the Royal Ordnance Factory Industrial Estate should be extended and that the Green Lane Industrial Estate should be developed. Spennymoor shared some brief film success in the early 90's with the production of 'Anymore for Spennymore' starring a few of the locals. There were, of course, early problems, but the new industries became established and, in most cases, began to expand. The coal industry has been replaced by manufacturers of consumer goods, and factories of Electrolux, Thorn Lighting and Black and Decker were established. Rothmans International also had a cigarette factory, employing more than 400 people, in Spennymoor from circa 1980 up until 2000. Housing, too, has made great strides since the end of the War. By the end of 1963 over 1,120 sub-standard houses had been cleared and as many new Council houses built for letting ‚Äì whilst over 400 houses had been improved by grant aid. In 1963 too there came the first private building developments to take place since back in the days of the 19th century colliery owners. The 800 house estate at Greenways and the 300 house estate at Tudhoe Grange were started, although it was not until the industrial prosperity of the 1970s that private house building reached 100 a year. The greatest project came with the development of the Tudhoe ironworks site ‚Äì 70 acres that was turned into the Bessemer Park Housing Estate. In 1968 work commenced on blocks of flats and houses there (comprising 1,009 household units in total) and this allowed the clearance of 500 unfit houses as well as the provision of housing for workers coming to the new factories. The blocks of flats on the Bessemer Park Housing Estate were subsequently demolished in the 1980s, due to serious problems with damp in the flats that rendered them extremely unpopular with tenants. In 1966 the town opened a new bus station, between Cambridge Street and Silver Street, to relieve traffic congestion on the High Street. This bus station was subsequently redeveloped as a car park circa 1990. Also in 1966, the nearby Parkwood Shopping Precinct (which included a Woolworths and a supermarket) was opened. In 2016 it was announced that the Parkwood Precinct would be substantially redeveloped due to low tenancy rates in the shops, an escalating issue since the turn of the millennium. =Notable people= * John Bain, video game commentator and consumer rights advocate, was born in the town. * Actor Gibson Gowland, was born in the town. * Anne Wood, creator of the Teletubbies and In The Night Garden, was born and brought up in Spennymoor. * Norman Cornish (18 November 1919 ‚Äì 1 August 2014) was an English mining artist. Politics Spennymoor had elected Labour MPs for many years, but in recent times the area has become more marginal. From 1918 to 1950 it had its own parliamentary constituency, from 1950 to 1974 it was in the Durham constituency and from 1974 to 1983 in the North West Durham constituency. From 1983 to 1997 it was part of the Sedgefield constituency; during this time the MP was Tony Blair, who was Leader of the Opposition for the last three years of his tenure as the town's MP. The town had been moved out of the constituency by the time he became Prime Minister. Since 1997 it has been part of the Bishop Auckland constituency, whose MP from 2005 to 2019 was Helen Goodman, from the Labour Party. In 2019 the seat elected its first Conservative MP, Dehenna Davison. Spennymoor returns 5 County Councillors to Durham County Council from two Electoral Divisions covering the town, and its constituent villages. Tudhoe Division covers Tudhoe Village, Tudhoe Moor, and Low Spennymoor and is currently represented by two Spennymoor Independents People Before Politics Councillors (Neil Grayson and Alan Gardner). Spennymoor Division covers Spennymoor, Middlestone Moor, and Byers Green and is currently represented by three Spennymoor Independents People Before Politics Councillors (Kevin Thompson, Geoff Darkes and Elizabeth Maddison). Spennymoor also has its own Town Council, Spennymoor Town Council, which provides local services such as Jubilee Park, the Spennymoor Town Hall, Allotments and various play areas and community centres throughout the Town.http://parishes.durham.gov.uk/spennymoor/Pages/CouncilServices.aspx 22 Councillors sit on the Spennymoor Town Council, of which 16 are currently Spennymoor Independents People Before Politics, 3 are Labour, 2 are Independent and 1 is Liberal Democrat.http://www.spennymoor-tc.gov.uk/your- council/meet-your-councillors/ The current Town Mayor is Cllr Elizabeth Wood, and her Deputy is Cllr liz maddison. Landmarks =Whitworth Hall= Dating from 1183, the Whitworth Hall estate was owned by and home to the Shafto family for over 300 years, including County Durham MP \\"Bonnie Bobby Shafto\\", made famous by the well known ballad and nursery rhyme. It is now the site of Whitworth Hall Hotel and the deer park for which the estate is famed is still well tended, as is the walled garden. =Spennymoor Settlement= A local arts community founded in the 1930s by Bill & Betty Farrell with the aid of the Pilgrim Trust, \\"To encourage tolerant neighbourliness and voluntary social services and give its members opportunities for increasing their knowledge, widening their interests, and cultivating their creative powers in a friendly atmosphere\\". The Settlement was home to the town's first library, and amongst famous local people who were a part of its history were Norman Cornish, \\"the pitman painter\\" and Shildon-born writer Sid Chaplin. The building is a centre for the arts- mostly drama and music, but other community events take place here. =Durham Mining Museum= right The Durham Mining Museum is housed in Spennymoor Town Hall, and covers mining in the north of England - mines in the historic counties of County Durham, Northumberland, Cumberland, and Westmorland, and North Yorkshire's ironstone mines. The displays comprise three sections: a display of small mining artifacts, models of larger machines, and a simulation of a mine tunnel for visitors to experience. It was opened in 1998, has been a registered charity since 2000, and is supported by a Friends group. Its display rooms are open to the public on weekdays and Saturdays except bank holidays, and it maintains a website holding a large amount of archive material. The museum is \\"dedicated to the memory of more than 24,000 men, women and children who have lost their lives in mining related accidents in the North of England since 1293\\". Miners' banner A new banner was marched for the first time in the 2006 Durham Miners' Gala (The Big Meeting), representing 13 (former) local collieries. The banner was unfurled on the night before the big meeting, by MEP Stephen Hughes and long- time trade unionist Rodney Bickerstaffe, General Secretary of the trade union UNISON from 1995 to 2001. Its first outing on the following day began with visits to 'The Tubs', a miners' memorial made from tubs once used underground in Ellington Colliery, Northumberland, which honours the memory of all of the men and boys who lost their lives in the mines of Spennymoor and district, then went on to two war memorials, the main cenotaph outside the leisure centre and a smaller memorial in Tudhoe Cemetery. Facilities Jubilee Park The main attraction in Spennymoor is Victoria Jubilee Park which was given to the people of the town by Queen Victoria to celebrate the jubilee of her reign, and is sited on land which was once part of the Whitworth Hall estate of the Shafto family. Until World War II there was a cannon from the Crimean War on display in the park, this was taken away to be melted down for munitions. A Millennium arch was erected in the park. The leisure centre houses a swimming pool, and offers swimming lessons, football coaching, martial arts tutoring, fitness classes, multi sensory room, badminton practice, a Lifestyle Fitness gym and gymnastic workouts and is also home to Regional Gymnasium Centre, made possible by funding from the National Lottery, Sport England and Sedgefield Borough Council, and is amongst the most modern in the country. There are also plans for a new regional arts centre to be added to the leisure centre, which stands at the junction of High Street and Cheapside in the town centre. Spennymoor Town F.C. are the main local football team and won the FA Vase in 2013, after winning 2‚Äì1 in the final at Wembley Stadium against Tunbridge Wells. Spenny Cinema, a monthly community cinema, is run at St Paul's Centre in the heart of Spennymoor by Damascus Road Technical Services, in association with the centre.

Early life Emma Freud was born in London on 25 January 1962 and is the daughter of politician and broadcaster Sir Clement Freud (1924‚Äì2009) and June Flewett, known as the actress Jill Freud. She is the great-granddaughter of psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud. Her younger brother is Matthew Freud, and her uncle was the painter Lucian Freud. Her father's family were Jewish refugees. Freud was educated in London at the all-female Queen's College school and is an alumna of Royal Holloway College.Royal Holloway guide In 1979, whilst a member of the Queens College girls choir, she sang on the Mike Oldfield live album Exposed. Media career =Television= On television, she initially worked on cable television programmes for children, before co-presenting LWT's The Six O'Clock Show from 1986. In 1987, she co- hosted TVS's travel quiz for children, Worldwise. Later that year, she briefly earned a certain media notoriety for presenting a chat show, Pillow Talk, in which she interviewed guests whilst in bed with them, as part of LWT's late- night strand Night Network. In 1986, Freud also appeared as Princess Diana in a Thames Television special, spoofing the Royal Variety Performance, alongside impressionist Mike Yarwood, who appeared as Prince Charles, among other roles. In 1990 and 1991, Freud presented two series of Plunder, an afternoon chat show on BBC2 in which she interviewed guests about their favourite television clips. Freud has also presented Channel 4 programmes, such as The Pulse on the subject of health, and The Media Show. She fronted Theatreland for LWT, on the topic of entertainment. =Radio= On the radio, she has been a regular contributor to Radio 4's Saturday miscellany Loose Ends, hosted originally by Ned Sherrin, now by Clive Anderson. In 1988, she was one of the launch presenters of GLR, where she presented the weekday 10.00 am programme. One of her producers during this period was Chris Evans. She also appeared on Just A Minute on 14 April 1990, playing against her father, who was a show regular. In 1993, Freud first appeared on BBC Radio 1, deputising for Nicky Campbell on his late night show Into The Night. Later that year, she was invited by the network's new controller Matthew Bannister to reinvent the lunchtime programme previously presented by Jackie Brambles. From January 1994, she appeared on permanent basis on the station every weekday between noon and 2.00 pm, presenting a mix of music, interviews and interactive news features. Her programme was praised by some but it proved unpopular with many who preferred the old mainstream pop fare. In Simon Garfield's 1998 book on Radio 1, The Nation's Favourite, Bannister claims that Freud was \\"treated very badly by people at the station, especially other women\\". Other work Freud edited scripts for a number of films and comedy programmes written by her partner Richard Curtis, including Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill and The Vicar of Dibley. She was regularly involved with Curtis's other projects, including Comic Relief, the British charity and biannual telethon that he helped establish. She was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2011 Birthday Honours for services to Comic Relief. The couple have four children. Freud was added to the judging panel of the Norwich Film Festival for 2014. In August 2014, Freud was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September's referendum on that issue.

He was the sixth and last president of the independent republic the Orange Free State from 1896 to 1902.  Early life  The Steyn family lived near Winburg on the farm Josephinesdal. Steyn was born on 2 October 1857 on the farm Rietfontein near Winburg in the Orange Free State.Van der Merwe, NJ (1921) Marthinus Theunis Steyn. 'n Lewensbeskrywing. Part 1. De Nationale Press Beperkt, Cape Town. His father Marthinus (known as Marthinus 'blinkstewels') was away from home, following the death of his own father, to assist his mother on a three-month long round trip from Winburg to Swellendam in the Cape Colony. As Cecilia, Steyn's mother, was pregnant with Marthinus Theunis, they thought it safer for her to stay with her sister Gertruida, who was married to Theunis Wessels, a farmer at Rietfontein. Steyn was intended to be named only Marthinus after his father, but because of the care that Theunis and Gertruida took during Cecilia's pregnancy, Steyn was named both after his father Marthinus and his uncle Theunis. In later years his family always called him Theunis. During the Free State‚ÄìBasotho War of 1858, the Steyns were driven from their farm and lost almost everything. After the death of Steyn's two grandfathers, his Wessels grandmother convinced his father to buy his own farm. They bought the farm Suurfontein/Zuurfontein, on the Modder River, about 13 miles from Bloemfontein. It is on this farm that Steyn spent most of his youth, and experienced the open and free spaces of the Free State. Steyn started his school years in a small farm school, on the farm Rooiwal. The school was forty minutes away by horse and the teacher was Mr. Wiggins, who taught in English. Another Basotho War started in 1864, disrupting the family, and causing Theunis and his brother Tewie to stay with their grandmother in Wessels, where they attended a small grammar school briefly; afterwards they were sent to Grey College. At the age of 16, he left school with his brother Tewie to farm on Zuurfontein.Van Schoor, MCE (2009) Marthinus Theunis Steyn. Regsman, staatsman en volksman. Protea Boekhuis, Pretoria. Steyn's family lived right across from the then president of the Free State, J.H. Brand, in Bloemfontein. The family socialized with other groups of Dutch families. The Steyn home in Bloemfontein, Green Lodge, was the meeting place for the young people of Bloemfontein.Truter E (1997) Tibbie: Rachel Isabella Steyn 1865-1955: Haar lewe was haar boodskap. Human and Rosseau. Kaapstad. The house was open for everybody: from the Fichardts of German origin, to the English speaking Robertses, to the Jewish Baumans, to English speaking Afrikaners, like President Brand, as well as the Dutch community.  Studies  After finishing his studies at Grey College, and after farming for four years on Suurfontein/Zuurfontein, a visit by Judge James Buchanan, a member of the Orange Free State High CourtZimmermanm R and Visser DP (1996) Southern Cross: Civil Law and Common Law in South Africa. Clarendon Press, Oxford. changed Steyn's direction from farming towards further studies in law. According to Judge Buchanan's daughter, he was set on convincing Steyn's father that they needed to send Steyn to the Netherlands to study law at Leiden University. Steyn and his friend Harry Vels left in May 1877 on the Dunrobin Castle from Port Elizabeth for Cape Town and from there to Europe. In Cape Town, more passengers, including Rev. Colin Fraser and his family, on his way to Scotland as delegate for the Free State Church at the Pan-Presbyterian Council (now known as the World Alliance of Reformed Churches), (accompanied by the 12-year-old Tibbie Fraser, later to become the wife of Steyn). Also onboard was the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek government delegation consisting of Paul Kruger, the then Vice State President, E.J.P. Jorissen, the state attorney and their secretary, Willem Eduard Bok, on their way to England to lay a formal protest against the proclamation of Theophilus Shepstone asserting British sovereignty over the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek. Steyn and Vels did preparatory studies under W.F.P. Enklaar and Dr. B. Wisselink at the Gymnasium in Deventer. In September 1879, they would have taken their admission exams for the Leiden University, however, they decided to move to England instead. This decision was made as they needed an English certificate and training to be allowed to practice law in South Africa. Steyn took his admission exam in January 1880 for the Inner Temple in London. Steyn was called to the English bar in November 1882 and shortly afterwards returned to South Africa.  Law career  After his return to South Africa he set up practice as barrister in Bloemfontein. In 1889, Steyn was appointed state attorney of the Orange Free State. A few months afterwards he became second puisne judge, and in 1893 first puisne judge of the high court. His decisions won him a reputation for ability and sound judgment.  Early political career  Marthinus 'blinkstewels', father of Steyn, as member of the Executive Council, regularly accompanied State President Johannes Brand on visits to determine the needs of the people of the Orange Free State. Steyn, as a lover of books, who took a small library of books with him during the Anglo-Boer War, was well read. Through his father and visits home, he kept in contact with the latest political views, activities and needs of the people. Steyn's first interest in the politics of the day was initiated by the disputed annexation of the diamond fields in the Kimberley area by the British government in 1871. Following the claims of the Griqua captain, Nicolaas Waterboer, Britain, driven by its \\"New Imperialism\\", agreed that the Cape Governor, Sir Henry Barkly, could annex the land, in direct conflict to the wishes of the Cape Colony Government and the Orange River Convention (Bloemfontein Convention) of 1854. The resolution of the payment, ¬£90, 000 and the building of a railway to the Orange Free State by the British Government in 1876, was not deemed acceptable to the people.  President of the Orange Free State  MT Steyn During his Presidential Inauguration In 1895, upon the resignation of state president Francis William Reitz, Steyn was the candidate of the pan-Dutch party for the vacant post. The election was held in February 1896 and resulted in a decisive victory for Steyn, who assumed office as president. The beginning of the Second Boer War, in 1899, caused Steyn to link the fortunes of his state with those of the Transvaal, allying with it against the British Empire. While the Orange Free State was under British occupation, Steyn ran his government from the field, playing a key role in continuing Boer resistance and the coordination of guerrilla warfare that made up most of the Boer War from 1900 onwards. Regarded as one of the most irreconcilable of the Boer leaders, he took part, however, in the preliminary peace negotiations at Klerksdorp in April 1902 but was prevented by illness from signing the Treaty of Vereeniging at Pretoria on 31 May 1902. The treaty ended the independence of the Orange Free State and Steyn's term as its president.  After 1902  By 1902, Steyn was suffering from myasthenia gravis brought on by his constant exertions; and in July 1902 he sailed for Europe, where he remained until the autumn of 1904. He then took the oath of allegiance to the British crown, and returning to South Africa partially restored to health resumed an active participation in politics. In 1908‚Äì1909, he was vice-president of the National Convention, the constitutional convention which resulted in the establishment of the Union of South Africa. Here he was distinguished for his statesmanlike and conciliatory attitude, while maintaining the rights of the Boer community. While addressing a meeting in Bloemfontein in November 1916, he collapsed and died of a heart attack, at 59.  Legacy  ;Afrikaner Bond From early on, Steyn, along with many other prominent Freestaters, came under the influence of a German, Carl Borckenhagen, the editor of the Bloemfontein Express newspaper, and in 1881 he had joined Borckenhagen in founding the Afrikaner Bond. ;South African Party In the Union of South Africa he was a co-founder of the South African Party which he left in 1914 with James Barry Munnik Hertzog and Christiaan Rudolf de Wet to found the National Party. ;National Party Steyn, James Barry Munnik Hertzog and Christiaan Rudolf de Wet co-founded the National Party in 1914. ;The C&N; Oranje Meisieskool The Anglo-Boer War and the great loss in woman and children was a driving force behind the origin of the C&N; Oranje Meisieskool, an originally Dutch and now Afrikaans girls school, that was initiated by Steyn. The school opened its doors in 1907. ;National Woman's Monument The Vrouemonument, the first monument in the world dedicated to women and children, was unveiled on 16 December 1913 and was initiated by the ideals of Steyn and the family friend, Emily Hobhouse. The sculptor Anton van Wouw and the architect Frans Soff designed the monument. ;University of the Free State In December 1895, Steyn mentioned in his election speech that he would do everything possible to see to it that the children of the Orange Free State received a good education. He consulted with the Government (Volksraad) to devise a framework to uplift the standard of education to the same level of other wealthier states. Steyn believed that education would bring about unification between different groups in the Free State.‚Äô'Marthinus Theunis Steyn'‚Äô, regsman staatsman volksman, M.C.E. Van Schoor, Protea Boekhuis, p. 85 During his inauguration speech in 1896, President Steyn stated that his vision, with regards to educational facilities, for the city of Bloemfontein was a university where youth from all over the country could come and study.‚Äô'Marthinus Theunis Steyn'‚Äô, regsman staatsman volksman, M.C.E. Van Schoor, Protea Boekhuis, p. 87 The University of the Free State was established as a higher institute of learning in 1904.  Descendants  Many of Steyn's descendants followed the family tradition of a career in politics or the legal profession. Steyn's son, Dr. Colin Steyn, was a Minister of Justice and Minister of Employment in Jan Smuts' South African Party Cabinet. Steyn's grandson, Marthinus Steyn - also known as Theunie - was a Judge in the South African Supreme Court of Appeal. He also served as Administrator-General of South-West Africa during its transition to the independent Republic of Namibia. During his tenure as Administrator- General, Theunie played an important role in instituting democratic reforms, including universal suffrage. Another grandson of Steyn, Jan, was a partner and head of the Patent Department of Pretoria law firm Adams & Adams. Steyn's great grandsons, Theuns and Colin Steyn, practice as lawyers. Theuns is a partner and corporate lawyer at the law firm Edward Nathan Sonnenbergs (ENSAfrica) in Cape Town. Colin is a senior public prosecutor in Bloemfontein. The former is married to South African High Court Judge Elize Steyn. Outside law and politics, Steyn's great-great granddaughter, Martine, is a French- English translator and copywriter who lives and works between Cape Town and Paris, France. Steyn's granddaughter was the well-known South African actress Nerina Ferreira.\\"Nerina Ferreira verskyn weer op die Verhoog\\" (1 June 1969) Die Burger, Cape Town Quote \\"The nation of the Orange Free State stand ready for war in such circumstances where peace cannot be secured with honour, and although we recognize our shortcomings, our nation depend on the power of God to deliver us and secure us a victory.

Formerly the prominent business district on India's west coast, Nariman Point yielded that status to Mumbai's Bandra-Kurla Complex in 2010.. Prior to Nariman Point's development, Mumbai's business centre was at Ballard Estate, which like Nariman Point also was built on land reclaimed from the sea. Located on the southern tip of the Mumbai peninsula, at the end of the Mumbai's Marine Drive, Nariman Point is named after Khursheed Framji Nariman, a municipal corporator who had initiated the area's development as an extension to the Back Bay reclamation. Nariman Point houses some of India's prestigious business headquarters, and despite its decline (see below), it remains one of the more expensive business districts in India, exceeded only by Delhi's Connaught Place and since April 2012 by Mumbai's own Bandra-Kurla Complex.. History Prior to 1940, the area was part of the Arabian sea. A popular leader of the Congress, Khurshed Nariman (affectionately called Veer Nariman), a Bombay Municipal Corporation corporator, proposed to reclaim the area from the sea near Churchgate. To accomplish this task, the shallow seafront was filled with debris from various parts of the city. Reinforced concrete cement was also used, the steel for which had to be purchased on the black market at higher prices due to World War II.The entire cost was estimated to be (equivalent to about in ). Additional reclamations were carried out in the 1970s. A construction boom in that decade also led to the development of commercial high-rises in the area. In 2006, prior to the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08, Nariman point was the 7th most expensive location in the world for office space. However, by December 2012 Nariman Point had fallen to 25th place while Delhi's Connaught Place remained the 5th most expensive location despite many offices moving to Gurgaon and Noida. During the same period, Nariman Point also dropped from 7th to 15th most expensive location for office rentals.. The reasons for the decline were the high prices, lower quality and age of construction, and increasing distances from residential hubs which have now moved northwards and to the suburbs.

Luis received a classical education at home; he began the study of Greek and Latin when he was 8, and by 16, he had concluded his studies in the humanities and law at the University of Salamanca. = Early work as an ambassador = In 1780, On√≠s joined his uncle, Jos√© de On√≠s, ambassador of Spain to the Electorate of Saxony in Dresden, Germany, who was known as one of the most accomplished men in politics, science, and belles lettres of the time. Luis joined the legation as his personal secretary and assumed duties as a trade commissioner. In the course of his work, he visited the royal courts of Berlin and Vienna as well as the courts of the other capital cities in Central Europe. In 1786, when he was 24 years old, On√≠s was sent on an important mission by the Spanish government, which knew that Saxony had the most highly developed mining industry in Europe and desired to acquire experienced miners to send to its American colonies. He went to study at the School of Mines in Freiberg, a town dominated by the mining and smelting industries, and enrolled in a course taught by the Prussian mineralogist, Professor Abraham Gottlob Werner. Becoming acquainted with operations in the mines, On√≠s learned of the existence of a surplus of miners looking for employment. Subsequently, the Count of Floridablanca decided to entrust the mission to the young man. He met with a diplomatic minister of Saxony, who was prepared to reject his request, but he was so impressed by the young man's knowledge of the pertinent facts and the force of his arguments that he agreed to his request and allowed him to choose thirty-six miners, including six managers, to send to Spain. In recognition of Onis's success, the Count proposed to appoint him as a minister to the United States, a promotion that he could not then accept. In 1792, On√≠s was decorated with the Cross of Charles III of Spain (Cruz de Carlos III). In 1798, he returned to Spain, where he was appointed to a position in the office of the First Secretary of State (Primer Secretar√≠o de Estado) in Madrid, being responsible for conducting negotiations with France. In April 1802, he took an active part in the negotiations for and the conclusion of the Treaty of Amiens and, in October, he was granted the customary perks of a \\"secretary to the King\\" (secretario del rey), including a house and an expense account. Following Napoleon Bonaparte's invasion of Spain in 1808 and with the impending abdication of Ferdinand VII, the remnant of the royal government moved to Seville, where On√≠s continued in his capacity as longest-serving senior officer of the Ministry. He soon received a proposal to lead a diplomatic mission to St. Petersburg, and then a designation to Sweden, neither of which came to pass. Finally, the Junta Central (the anti-French Spanish Government fighting Napoleon's brother, Joseph Bonaparte, now king of Spain as Jos√© I), decided to send him to the United States. = Ambassador to the United States = On 29 June 1809,R√≠o 1981, p. 44 On√≠s was appointed minister plenipotentiary (with full powers to take independent action) to the United States, his letter of appointment instructing him to embark as soon as possible for New York. His assignment was to ensure peace between the two nations and win formal recognition of Fernando VII as the legitimate ruler of Spain. He was to negotiate all points in dispute within certain defined limits; to encourage the loyalty of Spain's colonies in the New World; to buy supplies, armaments, and ships for Spain to use in its war against the French; and to counter Bonapartist propaganda in the US. He was to pursue these objectives despite the refusal of President James Madison to recognize him while the Peninsular war still raged in Europe. Arriving at the port of New York on 4 October 1809 aboard the Spanish frigate Cornelia, after a rough passage of 44 days, On√≠s requested an audience to present his credentials to President Madison but was promptly informed that the US government could not receive or recognize any minister from the provisional governments of Spain as long as the crown was in dispute and that until that question was resolved, the United States would remain neutral. Consequently, no member of the Cabinet would recognize him or enter into any official communication with him. The United States did not officially recognize On√≠s as ambassador until December 1815, all the while asserting that political considerations obliged it to remain neutral until the conclusion of the war in Spain despite assurances of support for the cause of Spanish independence by Madison. Soon after his arrival in the United States, On√≠s took up residence in Philadelphia, where he used the officially recognized consular office to run a shadow legation and worked tirelessly against attempts by the United States to penetrate into Florida, as well as its covert support for French agents moving to infiltrate the Spanish provinces. He paid special attention to the activities of Spanish and Latin American revolutionary agents, who sought to exploit the sympathy that American citizens felt for Spain's rebelling colonies in South America. Secretary of State James Monroe rejected his written protests but clandestinely lent his support to insurgent movements led by filibusterers and irregular American forces. The occupation of West Florida in 1810 was the culmination of a prolonged series of events over the course of several years, as a consequence of the indeterminacy of the border between Florida and Louisiana Purchase when France ceded it to Spain in 1763. At the start of the War of 1812 between the United States and Great Britain, the danger of invasion of East Florida, a territory that had never been in dispute, escalated and was a constant subject of concern in On√≠s's correspondence with Monroe. The US government finally officially recognized On√≠s as Ambassador of Spain, and he presented his credentials on December 20, 1815, five years after his arrival in New York. Thereafter, he continued asserting the Spanish arguments with his customary vigor. Monroe, meanwhile, sent an ambassador to Madrid, John Erving, who was snubbed by the Spanish Secretary of State, Pedro Cevallos, and had to wait several months for formal recognition of On√≠s's ambassadorship to the United States. Cevallos opposed making any significant concessions to secure a treaty and endeavored to buy more time for Spain with the mere appearance of negotiations. Cevallos transferred consultations from Madrid to Washington and ensured further delays by sending On√≠s the necessary powers but no instructions to proceed. Resisting American pressure to begin negotiations in earnest, On√≠s tried to delay official recognition by Madrid of the US embassy through various subterfuges, such as maneuvering for the replacement of Cevallos, which occurred on 30 October 1816. During his years in the United States, On√≠s published several pamphlets critical of its government under the pseudonym \\"Verus\\" (Latin: \\"True\\"). He advised the Viceroy of New Spain (Mexico), Francisco Javier Venegas, and the Governor of Cuba, the Marqu√©s de Someruelos, of the expansionist ambitions of the growing young nation. During the Mexican War of Independence, he maintained a network of spies to prevent contact between the rebels and potential allies in the United States. The network was particularly active in the fight against the so-called \\"insurgent corsairs,\\" many of them French privateers, who placed themselves at the service of the nascent republics of Spanish America. = Adams‚ÄìOn√≠s treaty = English translation by Tobias Watkins of On√≠s's memoir of the treaty negotiation The Adams‚ÄìOn√≠s treaty was signed on 22 February 1819 after two years of difficult negotiations and the intervention of the French ambassador Hyde de Neuville, who defended the Spanish position against the radicalism of Henry Clay in the United States Congress, and General Andrew Jackson, who was notoriously hostile to the Spanish presence in East Florida. Ratification of the treaty had been postponed for two years since Spain wanted to use it as an incentive to keep the United States from lending diplomatic support to the revolutionaries in South America. As soon as the treaty was signed, the US Senate ratified it unanimously; but because of Spain's stalling, a new ratification was necessary and this time there were objections. Clay and other western spokesmen demanded that Spain also give up Texas, but that proposal was defeated by the Senate, which ratified the treaty a second time on 19 February 1821, following ratification by Spain on 24 October 1820. Ratifications were exchanged three days later and the treaty was proclaimed on 22 February 1821, two years after its signing.Bradley 2015, p. 225 The treaty consisted of 16 articles, half of which settled issues that had been in dispute since 1783, ceding all the lands of the Spanish Crown located east of the Mississippi, known as the Floridas, to the United States. Settling the most serious point of contention, determining the borders to the west and northwest of the Mississippi, was delayed until the last moment, as On√≠s aimed at all costs to keep Texas, New Mexico and California under the dominion of Spain. The signing of the treaty received a surprisingly favorable response from the public and the United States Senate. On√≠s returned to Europe, convinced that the alternative to signing the treaty would have been the loss of all Spanish territories as far west as the boundaries of the Rio Grande and parts of the interior provinces (Provincias Internas) of New Spain. The Adams‚ÄìOn√≠s Treaty closed the first era of United States expansion by providing for the cession of East Florida; the abandonment of the controversy over West Florida (a portion of which had been seized by the United States); and the delineating of a boundary with the Spanish province of Mexico that clearly made Spanish Texas a part of Mexico, thus ending much of the vagueness in the boundaries of the Louisiana Purchase. Spain also ceded, to the US, its claims to the Oregon Country. For Spain, it meant that it kept Texas and retained a buffer zone between its Californian and New Mexican possessions and the territories of the United States. In 1820 On√≠s published a 152-page memoir on the diplomatic negotiation. It was translated from Spanish to English by US diplomatic commission secretary, Tobias Watkins, and republished in 1821 in the US. = Honors and last years = In 1818, the Spanish Cortes conferred on On√≠s the title of Regidor perpetuo de Salamanca (Perpetual alderman of Salamanca), a title that passed to his descendants in the male line.R√≠o 1981, p. 207 In mid-1819, On√≠s was awarded the Gran Cruz Americana (American Grand Cross) and the honors of Consejero de Estado (Councilor of State) and was appointed minister to St. Petersburg. The revolution of 1820, however, prevented his assuming this office. The new constitutional government revoked the appointment and instead assigned him to the embassy in Naples. The same year, he published a work in two volumes, entitled Memoria sobre las Negociaciones entre Espa√±a y los Estados Unidos de Am√©rica (Memoir Upon the Negotiations between Spain and the United States of America), a memoir of his role in the negotiations leading to the Treaty of 1819. His last diplomatic mission sent him to London in February 1821, where he participated in diplomatic consultations for the recognition of Hispanic American countries by the United States and managed to prevent the European powers from following the US example. In November 1822, On√≠s returned to Madrid, where he died on 17 May 1827, after an illness of four days.  Personal life  Luis married Federika Christina von Mercklein in Dresden on 9 August 1788. They had three children: Mauricio, Narciss, and Clementina. References Further reading * Brooks, Philip Coolidge.

Many SMRs are now developing into much broader historic environment records (HERs), including information on historic buildings and designed landscapes. Each record lists the location, type and period of site, along with a brief description and information on the location of more detailed sources of information such as site reports. This information is most commonly used to help inform decisions on the likelihood of new development affecting archaeological deposits. Government guidance (PPG 16 and SPP in Scotland) requires local authorities to consider archaeology a material consideration in determining planning applications and the SMR aids this consideration. While mentioned in guidance, there is no statutory requirement for local authorities to fund an SMR (although this was a provision in the England and Wales Heritage Protection BillNational Archives record for the Heritage Protection BillBill dropped) and there is great variety in implementation across the UK. Some SMRs are simple card indexes, others are command line Unix databases and others are more modern and GIS-based. They provide an enormously useful resource but are not always fully exploited or appreciated by the public. Efforts to place SMRs on-line have met with success in certain parts of Britain, although some archaeologists have voiced concern that making vulnerable sites better known to the public endangers them further, especially through illicit metal-detecting. The contrary argument is that informing the public of historic sites near them will in fact increase protection, as local people will take pride in their cultural heritage and seek to protect it. In 2007, an updated version of best practice guidance for HERs \\"Informing the Future of the Past: Guidelines for Historic Environment Records\\" has been made available on-line. Members of the public can usually consult their local SMR, or request a search be undertaken on their behalf, and they are commonly used by local historians, archaeological organisations and academics. An increasing number of SMRs and HERs are becoming available to search on-line, in England particularly via the Heritage Gateway.

Since its inception in the fourteenth century to the early nineteenth century, Kazimierz has been an independent city, a royal city of the Crown of the Polish Kingdom, a location south of the Old Town of Krak√≥w, separated from it by a branch of the Vistula river. For many centuries, Kazimierz was a place of coexistence and interpenetration of ethnic Polish and Jewish cultures. Its northeastern part of the district was historic Jewish, and its inhabitants were forcibly relocated by the German occupying forces into the Krakow ghetto just across the river in Podg√≥rze in 1941. Today Kazimierz is one of the major tourist attractions of Krakow and an important center of cultural life of the city. The boundaries of Kazimierz are defined by an old island in the Vistula river. The northern branch of the river (Stara Wis≈Ça ‚Äì Old Vistula) was filled-in at the end of the 19th century during the partitions of Poland and made into an extension of ul. Stradomska Street connecting Kazimierz district with Krak√≥w Old Town. Early history Casmirvs (left) in a 1493 woodcut from Hartmann Schedel's Nuremberg Chronicle (view facing west). Three early medieval settlements are known to have existed on the island defining Kazimierz. The most important of these was the pre-Christian Slavic shrine at Ska≈Çka (‚Äúthe little rock‚Äù) at the western, upstream tip of the island. This site, with its sacred pool, was later Christianised as the Church of St. Michael the Archangel in the 11th century and was the legendary site of the martyrdom of St. Stanis≈Çaw. There was a nearby noble manor complex to the southeast and an important cattle-market town of Baw√≥≈Ç, possibly based on an old tribal Slavic gr√≥d, at the edges of the habitable land near the swamps that composed the eastern, downstream end of the island. There was also a much smaller island upstream of Kazimierz known as the ‚ÄúTatar Island‚Äù after the Tatar cemetery there. This smaller island has since washed away. On 27 March 1335, King Casimir III of Poland (Kazimierz Wielki) declared the two western suburbs of Krak√≥w to be a new town named after him, Kazimierz (Casimiria in Latin). Shortly thereafter, in 1340, Baw√≥≈Ç was also added to it, making the boundaries of new city the same as the whole island. King Casimir granted his Casimiria location privilege in accordance with Magdeburg Law and, in 1362, ordered defensive walls to be built. He settled the newly built central section primarily with burghers, with a plot set aside for the Augustinian order next to Ska≈Çka. He also began work on a campus for the Krak√≥w Academy which he founded in 1364, but Casimir died in 1370 and the campus was never completed. Perhaps the most important feature of medieval Kazimierz was the Pons Regalis, the only major, permanent bridge across the Vistula () for several centuries. This bridge connected Krak√≥w via Kazimierz to the Wieliczka Salt Mine and the lucrative Hungarian trade route. The last bridge at this location (at the end of modern Stradomska Street) was dismantled in 1880 when the filling-in of the Old Vistula river bed under Mayor Miko≈Çaj Zyblikiewicz made it obsolete.

Jews had played an important role in the Krak√≥w regional economy since the end of the 13th century, granted the freedom of worship, trade and travel by Boles≈Çaw the Pious in his General Charter of Jewish Liberties issued already in 1264. The Jewish community in Krak√≥w had lived undisturbed alongside their ethnic Polish neighbours under the protective King Casimir III the Great, the last king of the Piast dynasty. Nevertheless, in the early 15th century pressured by the Synod of Constance some dogmatic clergy began to push for less official tolerance. Accusations of blood libel by a fanatic priest in Krak√≥w led to riots against the Jews in 1407 even though the royal guard hastened to the rescue. As part of the re-founding of the Krak√≥w university, starting in 1400, the Academy began to buy outbuildings in the Old Town. Some Jews moved to the area around modern Plac Szczepa≈Ñski.Francis William Carter, Trade and Urban Development in Poland: An Economic Geography of Cracow, from Its Origins to 1795, Cambridge University Press, 1994, p.71. The oldest synagogue building standing in Poland was built in Kazimierz at around that time, either in 1407 or 1492 (the date varies with several sources).

Miodowa 27 from the Internet Archive The Jewish Qahal petitioned the Kazimierz town council for the right to build its own interior walls, cutting across the western end of the older defensive walls in 1553. Due to the growth of the community and the influx of Jews from Bohemia, the walls were expanded again in 1608. Later requests to expand the walls were turned down as redundant. The area between the walls was known as the Oppidum Judaeorum, the Jewish City, which represented only about one-fifth of the geographical area of Kazimierz, but nearly half of its inhabitants. The Oppidum became the main spiritual and cultural centre of Polish Jewry, hosting many of Poland's finest Jewish scholars, artists and craftsmen. Among its famous inhabitants were the Talmudist Moses Isserles, the Court Jew Abraham of Bohemia, the Kabbalist Natan Szpiro, and the royal physician Shmuel bar Meshulam. Interior of the Old Synagogue of Kazimierz before 1939. The golden age of the Oppidum came to an end in 1782, when the Austrian Emperor Joseph II disbanded the kahal. In 1822, the walls were torn down, removing any physical reminder of the old borders between Jewish and ethnic Polish Kazimierz. When after 1795 (in the Third Partition of Poland) Austria acquired the city of Krak√≥w, Kazimierz lost its status as a separate city and became a district of Krak√≥w. The richer Jewish families quickly moved out of the overcrowded streets of eastern Kazimierz. Because of the injunction against travel on the Sabbath, however, most Jewish families stayed relatively close to the historic synagogues in the old Oppidum, maintaining Kazimierz's reputation as a ‚ÄúJewish district‚Äù long after the concept ceased to have any administrative meaning. By the 1930s, Krak√≥w had 120 officially registered synagogues and prayer houses scattered across the city and much of Jewish intellectual life had moved to new centres like Podg√≥rze. Jewish children in front of Corpus Christi church sometime before 1939. In a tourist guide that was published in 1935, Meir Balaban, a Reform rabbi and professor of History at the University of Warsaw, lamented that the Jews who remained in the once vibrant Oppidum were ‚Äúonly the poor and the ultraconservative.‚Äù However, this same exodus was the reason why most of the buildings in the Oppidum are preserved today in something close to their 18th century shape. During the Second World War, the Jews of Krakow, including those in Kazimierz, were forced by the Nazis into a crowded ghetto in Podg√≥rze, across the river. Most of them were later killed during the liquidation of the ghetto or in death camps. Postwar Jewish Kazimierz After the Second World War, devoid of Jews, Kazimierz was neglected by the communist authorities. However, since 1988, now a popular annual Jewish Cultural Festival has drawn Cracovians back to the heart of the Oppidum and re-introduced Jewish culture to a generation of Poles who have grown up without Poland's historic Jewish community. In 1993, Steven Spielberg shot his film Schindler's List largely in Kazimierz (in spite of the fact that very little of the action historically took place there) and this drew international attention to Kazimierz. Since 1993, there have been parallel developments in the restoration of important historic sites in Kazimierz and a booming growth in Jewish-themed restaurants, bars, bookstores and souvenir shops. Not only that, but there are also some Jews moving to Kazimierz from Israel and America. Kazimierz with Krakow, is having a small growth in Jewish population recently. A Jewish youth group now meets weekly in Kazimierz and the Remuh Synagogue, which actively serves a small congregation of mostly elderly Cracovian Jews. Each year at the end of June, the Jewish Culture Festival takes place in Kazimierz. It is Europe's largest Jewish festival of culture and music and attracts visitors from around the world. Music at the festival is very diverse and played by bands from the Middle East, USA and Africa, amongst others.

In early 867, Patriarch Photius of Constantinople announced to other Christian patriarchs that the Rus', baptized by his bishop, took to Christianity with particular enthusiasm. Photius's attempts at Christianizing the country seem to have entailed no lasting consequences, since the Primary Chronicle and other Slavonic sources describe the tenth-century Rus' as firmly entrenched in paganism. Following the Primary Chronicle, the definitive Christianization of Kievan Rus' dates from the year 988 (the year is disputedOleg Rapov, Russkaya tserkov v IX-pervoy treti XII veka (The Russian Church from the 9th to the First 3rd of the 12th Century). Moscow, 1988.), when Vladimir the Great was baptized in Chersonesus and proceeded to baptize his family and people in Kiev. The latter events are traditionally referred to as baptism of Rus' (, ) in Ukrainian and Russian literature. Prehistory Saints Cyril and Methodius on the Millennium of Russia monument in Veliky Novgorod According to the Church Tradition, Christianity was first brought to the territory of modern Belarus, Russia and Ukraine by Saint Andrew, the first Apostle of Jesus Christ. He traveled over the Black Sea to the Greek colony of Chersonesus Taurica in Crimea, where he converted several thousand men to the new faith. Allegedly Saint Andrew traveled also north along the Dnieper River, where Kiev would be founded around the 5th century, and as far north as the future location of Veliky Novgorod. The legendary account of the Rus'ian Primary Chronicle tells that Saint Andrew was amused by the Slavic customs of washing in hot steam bath, banya, on his way. North Pontic Greek colonies, both in Crimea and on the modern Ukrainian shores of the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea, remained the main centers of Christianity in Eastern Europe for almost a thousand years. Notable Christian locations there include the Inkerman Cave Monastery, a medieval Byzantine monastery where the relics of St. Clement, the fourth Bishop of Rome, were supposedly kept before their removal to San Clemente by Saints Cyril and Methodius. Saints Cyril and Methodius were the missionaries of Christianity among the Slavic peoples of Bulgaria, Great Moravia and Pannonia. Through their work they influenced the cultural development of all Slavs, for which they received the title \\"Apostles to the Slavs\\". They are credited with devising the Glagolitic alphabet, the first alphabet used to transcribe Old Church Slavonic,Liturgy of the Hours, Volume III, 14 February. Later on their students created the Cyrillic script in the First Bulgarian Empire used now in many Slavic countries, including Russia. After their deaths, their pupils continued their missionary work among other Slavs. Both brothers are venerated in the Ukrainian Catholic and Byzantine Catholic Churches as well as the Orthodox Church as saints with the title of \\"equal-to- apostles\\".  Ninth century  Vasily Perov's painting illustrates clandestine meetings of Christians in pagan Kiev. : The most authoritative source for the early Christianization of Rus' is an encyclical letter of Patriarch Photius, datable to early 867. Referencing the Siege of Constantinople of 860, Photius informs the Oriental patriarchs and bishops that, after the Bulgarians turned to Christ in 863,History of the Bulgarians from Antiquity to the 16th Century by Georgi Bakalov (2003) the Rus' followed suit. As was the case with the Bulgarians, the Patriarch found it prudent to send to the barbarians a bishop from Constantinople.Photii Patriarchae Constantinopolitani Epistulae et Amphilochia. Eds.: B. Laourdas, L. G. Westerinck. T.1. Leipzig, 1983. P. 49. With some modifications, the story is repeated by Constantine VII in De Administrando Imperio, followed by several generations of Byzantine historians, including John Skylitzes and Joannes Zonaras. That the imperial court and patriarchate regarded the 10th-century Rus' as Christians is evident from the fact that the bishopric of Rus' was enumerated in the lists of Christian sees, compiled during the reigns of Leo the Wise and Constantine VII. There is also an argumentum ex silentio: no Greek source recorded the second baptism of the Rus in the 990s.  Tenth century  St. Olga Whatever the scope of Photius's efforts to Christianize the Rus', their effect was not lasting. Although they fail to mention the mission of Photius, the authors of the Primary Chronicle were aware that a sizable portion of the Kievan population was Christian by 944. In the Russo-Byzantine Treaty, preserved in the text of the chronicle, the Christian part of the Rus' swear according to their faith, while the ruling prince and other non-Christians invoke Perun and Veles after the pagan custom. The Kievan collegiate church of St. Elijah (whose cult in the Slavic countries was closely modeled on that of Perun) is mentioned in the text of the chronicle, leaving modern scholars to ponder how many churches existed in Kiev at the time. St. Princess Olga in Constantinople, a miniature from the Radzivill Chronicle Either in 945 or 957, the ruling regent, Olga of Kiev, visited Constantinople with a certain priest, Gregory. Her reception at the imperial court is described in De Ceremoniis. According to legends, Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII fell in love with Olga; however, she found a way to refuse him by tricking him to become her godfather. When she was baptized, she said it was inappropriate for a godfather to marry his goddaughter. Although it is usually presumed that Olga was baptized in Constantinople rather than Kiev, there is no explicit mention of the sacrament, so neither version is excluded. Olga is also known to have requested a bishop and priests from Rome.Thietmar of Merseburg says that the first archbishop of Magdeburg, Adalbert of Prague, before being promoted to this high rank, was sent by Emperor Otto to the country of the Rus (Rusciae) as a simple bishop but was expelled by pagans. The same data is duplicated in the annals of Quedlinburg and Hildesheim, among others. Her son, Sviatoslav (r. 963-972), continued to worship Perun and other gods of the Slavic pantheon. He remained a stubborn pagan all of his life; according to the Primary Chronicle, he believed that his warriors would lose respect for him and mock him if he became a Christian. Sviatoslav's successor, Yaropolk I (r. 972-980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The Chronicon of Ad√©mar de Chabannes and the life of St. Romuald (by Pietro Damiani) actually document the mission of St. Bruno of Querfurt to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). Alexander Nazarenko suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.Alexander Nazarenko. –î—Ä–µ–≤–Ω—è—è –†—É—Å—å –Ω–∞ –º–µ–∂–¥—É–Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω—ã—Ö –ø—É—Ç—è—Ö. Moscow, 2001. .  Vladimir's baptism of Kiev  = Background = Ivan Eggink's painting represents Vladimir listening to the Orthodox priests, while the papal envoy stands aside in discontent During the first decade of Vladimir's reign, pagan reaction set in. Perun was chosen as the supreme deity of the Slavic pantheon and his idol was placed on the hill by the royal palace. This revival of paganism was contemporaneous with similar attempts undertaken by Jarl Haakon in Norway and (possibly) Svein Forkbeard in Denmark. His religious reform failed. By the late 980s he had found it necessary to adopt monotheism from abroad. The Primary Chronicle reports that, in the year 986, Vladimir met with representatives from several religions. The result is amusingly described in the following apocryphal anecdote. Upon the meeting with Muslim Bulgarians of the Volga, Vladimir found their religion unsuitable due to its requirement to circumcise and taboos against alcoholic beverages and pork; supposedly, Vladimir said on that occasion: \\"Drinking is the joy of the Rus.\\" He also consulted with Jewish envoys (who may or may not have been Khazars), questioned them about Judaism but ultimately rejected it, saying that their loss of Jerusalem was evidence of their having been abandoned by God.Primary Chronicle, year 6494 (986) In the year 987, as the result of a consultation with his boyars, Vladimir sent envoys to study the religions of the various neighboring nations whose representatives had been urging him to embrace their respective faiths. Of the Muslim Bulgarians of the Volga the envoys reported there is no joy among them; only sorrow and a great stench. In the gloomy churches of the Germans his emissaries saw no beauty; but at Hagia Sophia, where the full festival ritual of the Byzantine Church was set in motion to impress them, they found their ideal: \\"We no longer knew whether we were in heaven or on earth,\\" they reported, \\"nor such beauty, and we know not how to tell of it.\\"Primary Chronicle, year 6495 (987) = Baptism of Vladimir = The Baptism of Vladimir, a fresco by Viktor Vasnetsov St. Vladimir's Cathedral in Chersonesus, with the statue of Saint Andrew in the foreground Foreign sources, very few in number, present the following story of Vladimir's conversion. Yahya of Antioch and his followers (al-Rudhrawari, al-Makin, Al- Dimashqi, and ibn al-Athir)Ibn al-Athir dates these events to 985 or 986. give essentially the same account. In 987, the generals Bardas Sclerus and Bardas Phocas revolted against the Byzantine emperor Basil II. Both rebels briefly joined forces and advanced on Constantinople. On September 14, 987, Bardas Phocas proclaimed himself emperor. Anxious to avoid the siege of his capital, Basil II turned to the Rus' for assistance, even though they were considered enemies at that time. Vladimir agreed, in exchange for a marital tie; he also agreed to accept Christianity as his religion and bring his people to the new faith. When the wedding arrangements were settled, Vladimir dispatched 6,000 troops to the Byzantine Empire and they helped to put down the revolt.Golden, P.B. (2006) \\"Rus.\\" Encyclopaedia of Islam (Brill Online). Eds.: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C. E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill. In the Primary Chronicle, the account of Vladimir's baptism is preceded by the so- called Korsun' Legend. According to this apocryphal story, in 988 Vladimir captured the Greek town of Korsun' (Chersonesus) in Crimea, highly important commercially and politically. This campaign may have been dictated by his wish to secure the benefits promised to him by Basil II, when he had asked for the Rus' assistance against Phocas. In recompense for the evacuation of Chersonesos, Vladimir was promised the hand of the emperor's sister, Anna Porphyrogenita. Prior to the wedding, Vladimir was baptized (either in Chersonesos or in Kiev), taking the Christian name of Basil out of compliment to his imperial brother-in-law. The sacrament was followed by his marriage with the Byzantine princess.Lavrentevskaia Letopis, also called the Povest Vremennykh Let, in Polnoe Sobranie Russkikh Letopisey (PSRL), vol. 1, col.s 95-102. The alleged place of Vladimir's baptism in Chersonesos is marked by St. Vladimir's Cathedral. = Baptism of Kiev = Returning to Kiev in triumph, Vladimir exhorted the residents of his capital to the Dnieper river for baptism. This mass baptism became the iconic inaugural event in the Christianization of the state of Kievan Rus'. At first Vladimir baptized his twelve sons and many boyars. He destroyed the wooden statues of Slavic pagan gods (which he had himself raised just eight years earlier). They were either burnt or hacked into pieces, and the statue of Perun -- the supreme god -- was thrown into the Dnieper. Then Vladimir sent a message to all residents of Kiev, \\"rich, and poor, and beggars, and slaves\\", to come to the river on the following day, lest they risk becoming the \\"prince's enemies\\". Large numbers of people came; some even brought infants with them. They were sent into the water while priests, who came from Chersonesos for the occasion, prayed.Lavrent. (PSRL 1), col. 102. The Orekhovo-Borisovo Cathedral was built in the 21st century to celebrate the millennium of the Baptism of Rus' To commemorate the event, Vladimir built the first stone church of Kievan Rus', called the Church of the Tithes, where his body and the body of his new wife were to repose. Another church was built on top of the hill where pagan statues stood before.Lavrent. (PSRL 1), cols. 108-109.  Aftermath  The Ostromir Gospels, written in the Church Slavonic, one of the first dated East Slavic books. The baptism of Kiev was followed by similar ceremonies in other urban centres of the country. The Ioakim Chronicle says that Vladimir's uncle, Dobrynya, forced the Novgorodians into Christianity \\"by fire\\", while the local mayor, Putyata, persuaded his compatriots to accept Christian faith \\"by the sword\\". At that same time, Bishop Ioakim Korsunianin built the first, wooden, Cathedral of Holy Wisdom \\"with 13 tops\\" on the site of a pagan cemetery.Novgorodskaia tretiaia letopis, (PSRL 3), 208. On the initial conversion, see Vasilii Tatishchev, Istoriia rossiiskaia, A. I. Andreev, et al., eds. (Moscow and Leningrad: AN SSSR, 1962), vol. 1, pp. 112-113. Paganism persisted in the country for a long time, surfacing during the Upper Volga Uprising and other occasional pagan protests. The northeastern part of the country, centred on Rostov, was particularly hostile to the new religion. Novgorod itself faced a pagan uprising as late as 1071, in which Bishop Fedor faced a real threat to his person; Prince Gleb Sviatoslavich broke up the crowd by chopping a sorcerer in half with an axe.Arsennii Nasonov, ed. Novgorodskaia Pervaia Letopis: Starshego i mladshego izvodov (Moscow and Leningrad: AN SSSR, 1950), pp. 191-96. The Christianization of Rus firmly allied it with the Byzantine Empire. The Greek learning and book culture was adopted in Kiev and other centres of the country. Churches started to be built on the Byzantine model. During the reign of Vladimir's son Yaroslav I, Metropolitan Ilarion authored the first known work of East Slavic literature, an elaborate oration in which he favourably compared Rus to other lands known as the \\"Sermon on Law and Grace\\". The Ostromir Gospels, produced in Novgorod during the same period, was the first dated East Slavic book fully preserved. But the only surviving work of lay literature, The Tale of Igor's Campaign, indicates that a degree of pagan worldview remained under Christian Kievan Rus'. In 1988, the faithful of the Eastern Catholic and Orthodox churches which have roots in the baptism of Kiev celebrated a millennium of Eastern Slavic Christianity. The great celebrations in Moscow changed the character of relationship between the Soviet state and the church. For the first time since 1917, numerous churches and monasteries were returned to the Russian Orthodox Church. In Ukrainian communities around the world, members of various Ukrainian churches also celebrated the Millennium of Christianity in Ukraine.

It operated alongside other Western Allied efforts to extract German scientific and technological information and personnel during and after the war, including Operation Paperclip (for rocketry), Operation Alsos (for nuclear information) and Operation Surgeon (for avionics). Competition with the Soviet Union for these same spoils of war was intense, with direct payoffs including missile technology that led both to a heightened Cold War stalemate and landing a man on the Moon. History The project was initiated by the British, but when the US Army Chief of Staff General George Marshall learnt of it, it soon became Anglo-American. The aim was to seek out and capture the cryptologic secrets of Germany. The concept was for teams of cryptologic experts, mainly drawn from the code-breaking center at Bletchley Park, to enter Germany with the front-line troops and capture the documents, technology and personnel of the various German signal intelligence organizations before these precious secrets could be destroyed, looted, or captured by the Soviets. There were six such teams. *Team 1 was tasked to capture German Geheimschreiber (secret writer) machines whose enciphered traffic was code named Fish *Team 2 was to assist Team 1 with transporting Field Marshal Kesselring's communications train to Britain (the so-called \\"Jellyfish Convoy\\") *Team 3 was to investigate an intact German Signals intelligence unit called \\"Pers Z S\\" *Team 4 was to investigate in more detail the places in southern Germany that the Team 1 search had passed over quickly *Team 5: Following the serendipitous discovery of a waterproof box containing some of the archives of the Cipher Department of the High Command of the Wehrmacht (OKW/Chi) on the bed of Lake Schliersee, this team was tasked with recovering anything else of value from that lake *Team 6 aimed to capture and exploit material from the German Naval Intelligence Center and the German SIGINT headquarters =OKW/Chi (High Command)= The Allied supposition that the Supreme Command of the German Armed Forces, the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht Chiffrierabteilung (abbreviated OKW/Chi) was the German equivalent of Bletchley Park, was found to be incorrect. Despite it being the top SIGINT agency in the German military, it did not set policy and did not co-ordinate or direct the signal intelligence work of the different services. It concentrated instead on employing the best cryptanalysts to design Germany's own secure communications systems, and to assist the individual services organisations. These were: * The Army (Heer) OKH/GdNA, the Oberkommando ders Heeres/General der Nachrichten Autklaerung * Air Force (Luftwaffe) Chi Stelle * Navy (Kriegsmarine) Beobachtungsdienst or B-Dienst * Foreign Office Pers ZS * Nazi Party Forschungsamt or FA Drs Huttenhain and Fricke of OKW/Chi were requested to write about the methods of solution of the German machines. This covered the un-steckered Enigma, the steckered Enigmas; Hagelin B-36 and BC-38; the cipher teleprinters Siemens and Halske T52 a/b, T52/c; the Siemens SFM T43; and the Lorenz SZ 40, SZ42 a/b. They assumed Kerckhoffs's principle that how the machines worked would be known, and addressed only the solving of keys, not the breaking of the machines in the first place. This showed that, at least amongst the cryptographers, the un-steckered Enigma was clearly recognized as solvable. The Enigmas with the plugboard (Steckerbrett) were considered secure if used according to the instructions, but were less secure if stereotyped beginnings or routine phrases were used, or during the period of what they described as the \\"faulty indicator technique\\" - used up until May 1940. It was their opinion, however, that the steckered Enigma had never been solved. =FA Discovery= The discovery in May 1945 of the Nazi Party's top secret FA signals intelligence and cryptanalytic agency at the Kaufbeuren Air Base in southern Bavaria came as a total surprise. The province of Luftwaffe chief Hermann G√∂ring, it has been described as \\"the richest, most secret, the most Nazi, and the most influential\\" of all the German cryptanalytic intelligence agencies. =Russian \\"FISH\\" Discovery= German prisoners prepare the \\"Russian Fish\\" for loading and shipment to England, June 1945. The greatest success for TICOM was the capture of the \\"Russian Fish\\", a set of German wide-band receivers used to intercept Soviet high-level radio teletype signals. On May 21, 1945, a party of TICOM Team 1 received tip that a German POW had knowledge of certain signals intelligence equipment and documentation relating Russian traffic. After identifying the remaining members of the unit, they were all taken back to their previous base at Rosenheim. The prisoners recovered about 7 ¬Ω tons of equipment. One of the machines was re-assembled and demonstrated. TICOM officer 1st Lt. Paul Whitaker later reported. \\"They were intercepting Russian traffic right while we were there‚Ä¶pretty soon they had shown us all we needed to see.\\" =Related efforts= In Operation Stella Polaris the Finnish signals intelligence unit was evacuated to Sweden following the Finland/Soviet cease-fire in September 1944. The records, including cryptographic material, ended up in the hands of Americans.

It is a term used in early 20th century continental philosophy, especially in the works of Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, and the existentialists. Being-in-itself for Heidegger In the philosophy of Martin Heidegger, Being-in-itself is contrasted with the being of persons, which he terms Dasein. \\"Dasein means: care of the Being of beings as such that is ecstatically disclosed in care, not only of human Being...Dasein is itself by virtue of its essential relation to Being in general.\\" Heidegger recognized the dangers inherent to talking about Being in general and particular beings, and thus devoted space in Being and Time and the Introduction to Metaphysics to an explication of the differences; often noted by translators who distinguish Being (Sein), from a being (das Seiende). His attention to the complication is helpful for those who are looking for detailed explanation, but rarely clears the air of confusions. Dasein is Being that is aware of, and interested in, its own Being. Dasein is, by its nature, invested in social interaction and society. This is because in Heidegger's metaphysical system, one of the most fundamental ways to understand Being is through relationships. All things stand in a relation to all other things ‚Äî and by virtue of his stress on Dasein's ontological distinction, things may also stand in relation to Dasein. The argument for this claim draws heavily on Hegel's great work, the Phenomenology of Spirit. Essentially, Being in itself is one of Heidegger's main concerns throughout his authorship. Despite Heidegger's interest in it, he returns ‚Äî more often than not indirectly ‚Äî to the subject by interrogating other concepts that simply invoke Being without explicitly acknowledging it. In other words, whereas Heidegger calls the being of persons 'Dasein', he determines 'Being in itself' to be at the same time the most vague and general concept possible to contemplate, but also the topic of greatest interest to him as a philosopher. Being-in-itself for Sartre In Sartrean existentialism, being-in-itself (√™tre-en-soi) is also contrasted with the being of persons, which he describes as a combination of, or vacillation or tension between, being-for-itself (√™tre-pour-soi) and being-for-others (I'√™tre-pour-autrui). Being-in-itself refers to objects in the external world ‚Äî a mode of existence that simply is. It is not conscious so it is neither active nor passive and harbors no potentiality for transcendence. This mode of being is relevant to inanimate objects, but not to humans, who Sartre says must always make a choice.\\"Existentialism Is a Humanism\\", Lecture by J.P. Sartre, 1946. One of the problems of human existence for Sartre is the desire to attain being-in-itself, which he describes as the desire to be God ‚Äî this is a longing for full control over one's destiny and for absolute identity, only attainable by achieving full control over the destiny of all existence. The desire to be God is one of the ways people fall into bad faith. Sartre's famous depiction of a man in a caf√© who has applied himself to a portrayal of his role as a waiter illustrates this. The waiter thinks of himself as being a waiter (as in being-in-itself), which Sartre says is impossible since he cannot be a waiter in the sense that an inkwell is an inkwell. He is primarily a man (being-for-itself), just one who happens to be functioning as a waiter ‚Äì with no fixed nature or essence, who is constantly recreating himself. He is guilty of focusing on himself as being-in-itself and not being-for-itself. Sartre would say that as a human, a being-for-itself by nature, the waiter is \\"a being that is not what it is and it is what it is not.\\" Therefore, the waiter who acts as if he is at his very core a waiter \\"is not what [he] is\\"- which is to say, he is not solely a waiter- and \\"is what [he] is not\\"- meaning that he is many things other than a waiter. In simply playing the part of a waiter, the man in this example is reducing himself to a \\"being-in-itself\\" and is therefore in bad faith.

Trenches are located at intervals across a site leaving the rest untouched. A mechanical excavator is used to dig down to archaeological features or natural geological deposits and any archaeology is recorded. No further excavation takes place at this stage. The results of the trial trenching are used to inform any future stage of work which may extend to full excavation of the rest of the site if the evaluation reveals significant finds. There is some argument over the sampling strategy to be employed in trial trenching, especially in evaluating sites that are intended for development. Issues such as the effectiveness of certain trench layouts or the percentage of the site to be dug (normally around 5% at present) are widely discussed. Whether an effective picture of past human activity on a site can be truly estimated through this methods is widely debated. Development can destroy buried archaeology forever and a reliable evaluation methodology is very important. Whilst it is difficult to quantify the number of false negative results there have certainly been examples of evaluations suggesting a relatively limited amount of past activity which has had to be upwardly revised during the excavation. In the UK the results of the trial trenching will be used to inform the decision on the need for any further archaeological work to be undertaken prior to development.

Stead published a series of hugely influential campaigns whilst editor of The Pall Mall Gazette, and he is best known for his 1885 series of articles, The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon. These were written in support of a bill, later dubbed the \\"Stead Act\\", that raised the age of consent from 13 to 16. Stead's \\"new journalism\\" paved the way for the modern tabloid in Great Britain. He is considered to have influenced how the press could be used to influence public opinion and government policy, and advocated \\"Government by Journalism\\".Joseph O. Baylen, \\"Stead, William Thomas (1849‚Äì1912)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online ed., September 2010. Retrieved 3 May 2011. He was known for his reportage on child welfare, social legislation and reformation of England's criminal codes. Stead died in the sinking of the RMS Titanic. Early life Stead was born in Embleton, Northumberland, the son of the Reverend William Stead, a poor but respected Congregational minister, and Isabella (n√©e Jobson), a cultivated daughter of a Yorkshire farmer.\\"Herbert & W T Stead\\", Derbyshire Advertiser and Journal, 6 March 1920, p. 19. A year later the family moved to Howdon on the River Tyne, where his younger brother, Francis Herbert Stead, was born. Stead was largely educated at home by his father, and by the age of five he was already well-versed in the Holy Scriptures and is said to have been able to read Latin almost as well as he could read English. It was Stead's mother who perhaps had the most lasting influence on her son's career. One of Stead's favourite childhood memories was of his mother leading a local campaign against the government's controversial Contagious Diseases Acts ‚Äì which required prostitutes living in garrison towns to undergo medical examination. From 1862 he attended Silcoates School in Wakefield, until 1864, when he was apprenticed to a merchant's office on the Quayside in Newcastle upon Tyne where he became a clerk. The Northern Echo Stead as a child From 1870, Stead contributed articles to the fledgling liberal Darlington newspaper The Northern Echo, and in 1871, despite his inexperience, was made the editor of the newspaper. At the time, Stead at just 22, was the youngest newspaper editor in the country. Stead used Darlington's excellent railway connections to his advantage, increasing the newspaper's distribution to national levels. Stead was always guided by a moral mission, influenced by his faith, and wrote to a friend that the position would be \\"a glorious opportunity of attacking the devil\\". In 1873, he married his childhood sweetheart, Emma Lucy Wilson, the daughter of a local merchant and shipowner; they would eventually have six children together. In 1876, Stead joined a campaign to repeal the Contagious Diseases Act, befriending the feminist Josephine Butler. The law was repealed in 1886. He gained notoriety in 1876 for his coverage of the Bulgarian atrocities agitation. He is also credited as \\"a major factor\\" in helping Gladstone win an overwhelming majority in the 1880 general election. The Pall Mall Gazette In 1880, Stead went to London to be assistant editor of the Liberal Pall Mall Gazette (a forerunner of the London Evening Standard), where he set about revolutionizing a traditionally conservative newspaper \\"written by gentlemen for gentlemen\\". When its editor, John Morley, was elected to Parliament, Stead took over the role (1883‚Äì1889). When Morley was made Secretary of State for Ireland, Gladstone asked the new cabinet minister if he were confident that he could deal with that most distressful country. Morley replied that, if he could manage Stead, he could manage anything. Over the next seven years Stead would develop what Matthew Arnold dubbed \\"The New Journalism\\". His innovations as editor of the Gazette included incorporating maps and diagrams into a newspaper for the first time, breaking up longer articles with eye-catching subheadings, and blending his own opinions with those of the people he interviewed. He made a feature of the Pall Mall extras, and his enterprise and originality exercised a potent influence on contemporary journalism and politics. Stead's first sensational campaign was based on a Nonconformist pamphlet, The Bitter Cry of Outcast London. His lurid stories of squalid life in the slums had a wholly beneficial effect on the capital. A Royal Commission recommended that the government should clear the slums and encourage low-cost housing in their place. It was Stead's first success. He also introduced the interview, creating a new dimension in British journalism when he interviewed General Gordon in 1884.Roland Pearsell (1969) The Worm in the Bud: The World of Victorian Sexuality: 369 In 1884, Stead pressured the government to send his friend General Gordon to the Sudan to protect British interests in Khartoum. The eccentric Gordon disobeyed orders, and the siege of Khartoum, Gordon's death, and the failure of the hugely expensive Gordon Relief Expedition was one of the great imperial disasters of the period. After General Gordon's death in Khartoum in January 1885, Stead ran the first 24-point headline in newspaper history, \\"TOO LATE!\\", bemoaning the relief force's failure to rescue a national hero.The Sunday Times (London), 13 May 2012 Sunday Edition 1; \\"National Edition Fleet Street's crusading villain; The Victorian editor whose love of sensationalism set the tone for the tabloids for a century Scandalmonger\\", 40‚Äì42. During the following year, he managed to persuade the British government to supply an additional ¬£5million to bolster weakening naval defences, after which he published a series of articles. Stead was not a hawk, instead believing Britain's strong navy was necessary to maintain world peace.Stead, Estelle (1913). My Father. (London) p. 112. He distinguished himself in his vigorous handling of public affairs and his brilliant modernity in the presentation of news. However, he is also credited as originating the modern journalistic technique of creating a news event rather than just reporting it, as his most famous \\"investigation\\", the Eliza Armstrong case, was to demonstrate.Roland Pearsell (1969) The Worm in the Bud: The World of Victorian Sexuality: 367‚Äì78. In 1886, he began a campaign against Sir Charles Dilke, 2nd Baronet over his nominal exoneration in the Crawford scandal. The campaign ultimately contributed to Dilke's misguided attempt to clear his name and his consequent ruin. Stead employed Virginia Crawford, and she developed a career as a journalist and writer, researching for other Stead authors, but never wrote on her own case or Dilke in any way. =Eliza Armstrong case= \\"Nineteenth Precinct, First Ward, Chicago\\", 1894map by Stead presenting 37 brothels, 46 saloons, 11 pawnbrokers In 1885, in the wake of Josephine Butler's fight for the repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts, Stead entered upon a crusade against child prostitution by publishing a series of four articles entitled \\"The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon\\". In order to demonstrate the truth of his revelations, he arranged the \\"purchase\\" of Eliza Armstrong, the 13-year-old daughter of a chimney sweep. His first instalment was trailed with a warning guaranteed to make the Pall Mall Gazette sell out. Copies changed hands for 20 times their original value and the office was besieged by 10,000 members of the public. The popularity of the articles was so great that the Gazette's supply of paper ran out and had to be replenished with supplies from the rival Globe. Though his action is thought to have furthered the passing of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885, his successful demonstration of the trade's existence led to his conviction for abduction and a three-month term of imprisonment at Coldbath Fields and Holloway prisons. He was convicted on technical grounds that he had failed to first secure permission for the \\"purchase\\" from the girl's father. The \\"Maiden Tribute\\" campaign was the high point in Stead's career in daily journalism. The series inspired George Bernard Shaw to write Pygmalion, and to name his lead character Eliza. Another of the characters described, the \\"Minotaur of London\\", has been suggested as having inspired Jekyll and Hyde. Review of Reviews and other ventures Stead in 1881 Stead resigned his editorship of the Pall Mall in 1889 in order to found the Review of Reviews (1890) with Sir George Newnes. It was a highly successful non-partisan monthly. The journal found a global audience and was intended to bind the empire together by synthesising all its best journalism. Stead's abundant energy and facile pen found scope in many other directions in journalism of an advanced humanitarian type. This time saw Stead \\"at the very height of his professional prestige\\", according to E. T. Raymond. He was the first editor to employ female journalists. In 1893‚Äì94 he lived in Chicago for six months, campaigning against brothels and drinking dens, and published If Christ Came to Chicago. Beginning in 1895, Stead issued affordable reprints of classic literature under such titles as The Penny PoetsThe Penny Poets (The Masterpiece Library: Series I) (\\"Review of Reviews\\" Office; Stead's Publishing House) - Book Series List, publishinghistory.com. Retrieved 6 October 2019. and Penny Popular Novels, in which he \\"boil[ed] down the great novels of the world so that they might fit into, say, sixty-four pages instead of six hundred\\". His ethos behind the venture pre-dated Allen Lane's Penguin Books by nearly forty years, and he became \\"the foremost publisher of paperbacks in the Victorian Age\\". In 1896, Stead launched the series Books for the Bairns, whose titles included fairy tales and works of classical literature.Stead's Publishing House Series Books, kent.edu. Retrieved 25 August 2019.Books for the Bairns (\\"Review of Reviews\\" Office), publishinghistory.com. Retrieved 6 October 2019. Stead became an enthusiastic supporter of the peace movement, and of many other movements, popular and unpopular, in which he impressed the public generally as an extreme visionary, though his practical energy was recognised by a considerable circle of admirers and pupils. Stead was a pacifist and a campaigner for peace, who favoured a \\"United States of Europe\\" and a \\"High Court of Justice among the nations\\" (an early version of the United Nations), yet he also preferred the use of force in the defence of law.W. T. Stead, \\"The Great Pacifist: an Autobiographical Character Sketch\\" (1901), published posthumously in The Review of Reviews for Australasia, (August 1912) pp. 609‚Äì20. He extensively covered the Hague Peace Conferences of 1899 and 1907; for the latter he printed a daily paper during the four-month conference. He has a bust at the Peace Palace in The Hague. As a result of these activities, Stead was repeatedly nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Two titles from Stead's Masterpiece Library for Boys and Girls With all his unpopularity, and all the suspicion and opposition engendered by his methods, his personality remained a forceful one, in both public and private life. He was an early imperialist dreamer, whose influence on Cecil Rhodes in South Africa remained of primary importance; many politicians and statesmen, who on most subjects were completely at variance with his ideas, nevertheless owed something to them. Rhodes made him his confidant, and was inspired in his will by his suggestions; and Stead was intended to be one of Rhodes's executors. However, at the time of the Second Boer War Stead threw himself into the Boer cause and attacked the government with characteristic violence, and consequently his name was removed from the will's executors.The Last Will and Testament of Cecil John Rhodes, ed. W. T. Stead (Review of Reviews Office: London), 1902. The number of his publications gradually became very large, as he wrote with facility and sensationalist fervour on all sorts of subjects, from The Truth about Russia (1888) to If Christ Came to Chicago! (Laird & Lee, 1894), and from Mrs Booth (1900) to The Americanisation of the World (1901). Stead was an Esperantist, and often supported Esperanto in a monthly column in Review of Reviews.Enciklopedio de Esperanto, 1933. In 1904 he launched The Daily Paper, which folded after six weeks, and Stead lost ¬£35,000 of his own money (almost ¬£3 million in 2012 value) and suffered a nervous breakdown. Meeting with William Randolph Hearst A year before the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War W. T. Stead traveled to New York to meet with William Randolph Hearst, to teach him Government By Journalism. Travel to Russia In 1905, Stead travelled to Russia to try to discourage violence, but his tour and talks were unsuccessful. Spiritualism Stead with his family, 1900s In the 1890s, Stead became increasingly interested in spiritualism. In 1893, he founded a spiritualist quarterly, Borderland, in which he gave full play to his interest in psychical research. Stead was editor, and he employed Ada Goodrich Freer as assistant editor; she was also a substantial contributor under the pseudonym \\"Miss X\\". Stead claimed that he was in the habit of communicating with Freer by telepathy and automatic writing.Borderland, volume I, 1893, p 6\\\\. Quoted in Hall (1980) p. 50. The magazine ceased publication in 1897. Stead claimed to be in receipt of messages from the spirit world and, in 1892, to be able to produce automatic writing. His spirit contact was alleged to be the departed Julia A. Ames, an American temperance reformer and journalist whom he met in 1890 shortly before her death. In 1909, he established Julia's Bureau, where inquirers could obtain information about the spirit world from a group of resident mediums. Grant Richards said that \\"The thing that operated most strongly in lessening Stead's hold on the general public was his absorption in spiritualism\\". The physiologist Ivor Lloyd Tuckett wrote that Stead had no scientific training and was credulous when it came to the subject of spiritualism. Tuckett examined a case of spirit photography that Stead had claimed was genuine. Stead visited a photographer who produced a photograph of him with an alleged deceased soldier known as \\"Piet Botha\\". Stead claimed the photographer could not have come across any information about Piet Botha; however, Tuckett discovered that an article in 1899 had been published on Pietrus Botha in a weekly magazine with a portrait and personal details.Ivor Lloyd Tuckett. (1911). The Evidence for the Supernatural: A Critical Study Made with \\"Uncommon Sense\\". Kegan Paul, Trench, Tr√ºbner & Company. pp. 52‚Äì53. In the early 20th century, Arthur Conan Doyle and Stead were duped into believing that the stage magicians Julius and Agnes Zancig had genuine psychic powers. Both Doyle and Stead wrote the Zancigs performed telepathy. In 1924 Julius and Agnes Zancig confessed that their mind reading act was a trick and published the secret code and all the details of the trick method they had used under the title of Our Secrets!! in a London Newspaper.John Booth. (1986). Psychic Paradoxes. Prometheus Books. p. 8. Ten years after the Titanic went down, Stead's daughter Estelle published The Blue Island: Experiences of a New Arrival Beyond the Veil,Pardoe Woodman and Estelle Stead (1922). The Blue Island: Experiences of a New Arrival Beyond the Veil. Hutchinson & Co., London. which purported to be a communication with Stead via a medium, Pardoe Woodman. In the book, Stead described his death at sea and discussed the nature of the afterlife. The manuscript was produced using automatic writing, and Ms. Stead cited as proof of its authenticity the writer's habit of going back to cross \\"t's\\" and dot \\"i's\\" while proof-reading, which she said was characteristic of her father's writing technique in life. Death on the Titanic Stead boarded the Titanic for a visit to the United States to take part in a peace congress at Carnegie Hall at the request of President William Taft. Survivors of the Titanic reported very little about Stead's last hours. He chatted enthusiastically through the 11-course meal that fateful night, telling thrilling tales (including one about the cursed mummy of the British Museum), but then retired to bed at 10.30pm. After the ship struck the iceberg, Stead helped several women and children into the lifeboats, in an act \\"typical of his generosity, courage, and humanity\\", and gave his life jacket to another passenger. A later sighting of Stead, by survivor Philip Mock, has him clinging to a raft with John Jacob Astor IV. \\"Their feet became frozen\\", reported Mock, \\"and they were compelled to release their hold. Both were drowned.\\"\\"Stead and Astor cling to Raft\\" (Worcester Telegram, 20 April 1912) at www.attackingthedevil.co.uk William Stead's body was not recovered. Further tragedy was added by the widely held belief that he was due to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize that same year. Stead had often claimed that he would die from either lynching or drowning. He had published two pieces that gained greater significance in light of his fate on the Titanic. On 22 March 1886, he published an article titled \\"How the Mail Steamer went down in Mid Atlantic by a Survivor\\",W.T. Stead, \\"How the Mail Steamer went down in Mid Atlantic\\" (1886) at www.attackingthedevil.co.uk wherein a steamer collides with another ship, resulting in a high loss of life due to an insufficient ratio of lifeboats to passengers. Stead had added: \\"This is exactly what might take place and will take place if liners are sent to sea short of boats\\". In 1892, Stead published a story titled \\"From the Old World to the New\\",W.T. Stead, \\"From the Old World to the New\\" (The Review of Reviews Christmas Number, 1892) at www.attackingthedevil.co.uk in which a vessel, the Majestic, rescues survivors of another ship that collided with an iceberg.  Reputation  Following his death, Stead was widely hailed as the greatest newspaperman of his age. His friend Viscount Milner eulogised Stead as \\"a ruthless fighter, who had always believed himself to be 'on the side of angels'\\". His sheer energy helped to revolutionise the often stuffy world of Victorian journalism, while his blend of sensationalism and indignation set the tone for British tabloids.F. Regard, 'The sexual exploitation of the poor in W.T. Stead's The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon (1885) : Humanity, democracy and the origins of the tabloid press', in Narrating Poverty and Precarity in Britain (ed. B. Korte et F. Regard), Berlin, De Gruyter, 2014, pp. 75‚Äì91. Like many journalists, he was a curious mixture of conviction, opportunism and sheer humbug. According to his biographer W. Sydney Robinson, \\"He twisted facts, invented stories, lied, betrayed confidences, but always with a genuine desire to reform the world ‚Äì and himself.\\" According to Dominic Sandbrook, \\"Stead's papers forced his readers to confront the seedy underbelly of their own civilisation, but the editor probably knew more about that dark world than he ever let on. He held up a mirror to Victorian society, yet deep down, like so many tabloid crusaders, he was raging at his own reflection.\\" According to Roy Jenkins, Stead became \\"the most sensational figure in 19th- century journalism\\". A memorial bronze was erected in Central Park, New York City, in 1920. It reads, \\"W. T. Stead 1849‚Äì1912. This tribute to the memory of a journalist of worldwide renown is erected by American friends and admirers. He met death aboard the Titanic April 15, 1912, and is numbered amongst those who, dying nobly, enabled others to live.\\" A duplicate bronze is located on the Thames Embankment not far from Temple, where Stead had an office. A memorial plaque to Stead can also be seen at his final home, 5 Smith Square, where he lived from 1904 to 1912. It was unveiled on 28 June 2004 in the presence of his great-great-grandson, 13-year-old Miles Stead. The plaque was sponsored by the Stead Memorial Society. In his native Embleton, a road has been named \\"W T Stead Road\\". In the 2009 video game Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors, Stead's 'How the Mail Steamer Went Down in Mid Atlantic by a Survivor, From the Old World to the New, and his death on the Titanic, is discussed by Akane Kurashiki and Junpei Tenmyouji, who debate the possibility that Stead was undergoing automatic writing by connecting to his future self.

He was a major figure in the Nahda, which began in Egypt in the late 19th century and spread to the Middle East. He is considered to be the first Syrian nationalist, due to his publication of Nafir Suria which began following the 1860 Mount Lebanon civil war. In 1870, he founded Al-Jinan, the first important example of the kind of literary and scientific periodicals which began to appear in the 1870s in Arabic alongside the independent political newspapers. Life Al-Bustani was born to a Lebanese Maronite Christian family in the village of Dibbiye in the Chouf region, in January 1819. He received primary education in the village school, where he attracted the attention of his teacher, Father Mikhail al-Bustani, because of his keen intelligence that he showed brilliantly. The latter recommended him to the Bishop of Sidon and Beiteddine, Abdullah al-Bustani, who sent him at the age of 11 to the school at ‚ÄòAyn Warqa in Ghosta, the most famous school of that period, to continue his studies there. At ‚ÄòAyn Waraqa where he learned Syriac and Latin. He spent ten years there and learned several foreign languages including French, Italian and English. In 1840, after completing his studies at ‚ÄòAyn Warqa‚Äô, Al-Bustani moved to Beirut and obtained his first employment outside of academia as a dragoman for the British Armed Forces assisting them in their efforts in evicting Ibrahim Pasha from Syria in the interest of preserving the Ottoman Empire. Later that year al-Bustani was hired by American Protestant Missionaries as a teacher and from that point on he worked closely with the Protestant mission in Beirut. In Beirut, he came into contact with the American Protestant missionaries with whom he worked closely until his death on May 1, 1883. Following his initial employment with the American Protestant Mission in Beirut al-Bustani spent most of his years working for the American Protestant Mission. It was during these years that al-Bustani converted to their Protestant faith and completed many of his early works. Arabic grammar and arithmetic books were among these early works along with the Van Dyck's version of the Bible, the most popular Arabic translation of the Bible used today. Both al-Bustani and Nasif Al-Yaziji worked on Van Dyck's version under the supervision of Eli Smith who was an American Protestant Missionary, scholar and Yale graduate. The translation project was continued unto fruition after al-Bustani under Cornelius Van Allen Van Dyck. While working to translate the Bible, Al-Bustani learned Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek, and perfected Syriac and Latin thus bringing the number of languages he mastered to nine. Role in al-Nahda In the late 1840s al-Bustani obtained the position of the official dragoman for the America Consulate in Beirut which he held until he passed it on to his son Salim in 1862. Through the 1850s Bustani continued to work closely with the Protestant Missionaries in their attempt of proselytizing and educating Arab Christians in the Levant. However, at this time al-Bustani began to diverge from the Missionaries method of education and began to express publicly the need for an Arabic identity that would be reflected in all spheres of society. In a lecture, ‚Äúon the literature of the Arabs‚Äù, given in February 1859. al-Bustani publicly called for a revival of literature and scholarly works in the Arabic language. It was also in 1859 that al-Bustani disengaged from his work with the mission and devoted his time to this cause. Shortly after his lecture in Beirut in 1859, al-Bustani became the secretary of a cultural association for the publication of Arabic books, al-Umda‚Äô al-Arabiyya l-Ishar al-Kutub al-Arabiyya. It was al- Bustani's exodus from religious education and move towards secular, national education at this time that revolutionized Arab culture and set the stage for the Nahda. Following the Maronite/Druze civil war of Mount Lebanon in 1860, al-Bustani, having witnessed these political/religious tensions, published an irregular newspaper which he called Nafir al-Surriya (a Clarion of Syria), wherein he voiced his ideal of a Syrian fatherland. Along with instilling Syrian Patriotism and ‚Äúproto-nationalism‚Äù, Al-Bustani sought to reform education and so founded the madrasah al-Wataniyya in Beirut in 1863, his own National School in Lebanon where he applied his theories on education, namely his educational agenda. The National School educated its students in Arabic, French, English, Turkish, Latin and Greek and modern sciences without the pretense of religion but with an obvious nationalistic aim. Al-Bustani welcomed students from all religions and races and qualified staff not based on their religious standing but their competence and professional qualities. The school was successful because it was unique in Syria at the time as being an educational institution based on secular ideals of equality and non- discrimination and thus stood against the religious schools that were closed off to the modern world. However, the rising religious solidarity in Syria eventually led to it being closed in 1878. It was during the proceeding years throughout the 1860s that his major contributions to the Nahda emerged. These included a daily newspaper and the first Arabic encyclopedia Al-Muhit al Muhit (The ocean of oceans) and an Arabic dictionary dairat al-ma‚Äôarif (dictionary of knowledge). Al-Bustani's intention in these works was to form a common body of knowledge which, though was very French, was considered universal. It was at this time that he came to be known famously as the Master and Father of the Arabic Renaissance. The greater part of his life's work was reviving and creating a love for the Arabic language, bringing Arabic into a place of affluence and utility as a tool for Arabs to express their thoughts and ideas in the modernising world of the 19th century. In 1868, al-Bustani helped found the Syrian Scientific Society al-Ja‚Äômiyya al-Ilmiyya al-Suriyya, a group of intellectuals who would be a part of promoting the study of science in educational institutions in Syria. Al-Bustani made large strides in forging a nationalism for Arabs by adopting and contextualizing European political and social values and education while maintaining a distinct nationalism, patriotism and Arab identity. All of this was to the advancement and continuation of the Arab cultural and literary renaissance at large that moved from Egypt to Syria/Lebanon. The reforms in the Ottoman Empire (see Tanzimat) from 1839‚Äì1876 and the work of the Young Ottomans strongly influenced al- Bustani to see that ‚ÄúOttomanism‚Äù was the best means of achieving nationalism politically being that it was the closest model available for him in Syria and in particular it was a Romantic nationalism, whereby one must recreate or recover a culture by looking into the past. In Bustani's case he looked to the scientific revolution in the Golden Age of Islam under the Abbasid Caliphate in Baghdad (8th to 13th century A.D.) He argued that at that time, Europe was in the decline of the Dark Ages and that Arabs must once again reclaim that heritage. However, it wasn't an Islamic heritage Bustani was after for he was a secularist. Though a Protestant Christian, he did not seek religious reform but rather a reform similar to what the French had with the separation of the Church institutions from the State institutions. It was this very separation that was key for the European Renaissance and al-Bustani saw the same need for the Nahda. Al-Bustani viewed the edicts of the Young Ottomans as freedom for non-Muslims and an opportunity for Arabs in Syria to gain sovereignty. Thus politically, he helped Syria towards Ottomanism in the sense that the edicts allowed participation of citizens of the state regardless of religious affiliation. Education, for Bustani, was the main vehicle to achieve an Arab identity and nationalism and it was only by the mass production of literature and its speedy circuit throughout the Middle East, afforded by the Nahda, that such an identity could be formed. Al-Bustani's years in the Protestant Mission led him to be at odds with educating a people about remote places and histories clearly seen in a quote from a lecture of his on education, \\"there should be one educational system for (all) the children of the nation (‚ÄòUmma), to safeguard its (cultural) identity. Thus in the realm of education, Bustani helped pave the way for a distinctly Arab education. His national/secular educational agenda in the midst of religious education was paramount to Syria's development. Al-Bustani's contributions to Arab language and literature and his creating a medium and structure to spread his ideas and the ideas of other intellectuals in Syria led to great reforms of literature and moreover created a common body of knowledge for the Arab, a body that was a pre-requisite to modernity and Arab and also, some state, Syrian nationalism. Butrus al-Bustani stands among the reformers that helped push the Middle East into modernity without seeing the reform as primarily Islamic. For he took a non-sectarian approach and worked to bring together both Christians and Muslims into the greater agenda of the revolution of Arab identity and culture. Achievements In the social, national and political spheres, he founded associations with a view to forming a national √©lite and launched a series of appeals for unity in his magazine Nafir Suriya. In the educational field, he taught in the schools of the Protestant missionaries at ‚ÄòAbey before founding his own National School in 1863 on secular principles. At the same time, he compiled and published several school textbooks and dictionaries to become known famously as the Master and Father of the Arabic Renaissance. Al- Bustani compiled an Arabic dictionary and published eleven volumes of an Arabic encyclopedia with the help of his sons. He wished to spread awareness and appreciation for the Arabic language, hoping to promote the cultural significance of the Middle East in the modern world.William L. Cleveland In the cultural/scientific fields, he published a fortnightly review and two daily newspapers. In addition, he began work, together with Drs Eli Smith and Cornelius Van Dyck of the American Mission, on a translation of the Bible into Arabic known as the Smith-Van Dyke translation. He founded the National School (Lebanon)National School in Beirut. His prolific output and groundbreaking work led the creation of modern Arabic expository prose. While educated by westerners and a strong advocate of western technology, he was a fierce secularist, playing a decisive role in formulating the principles of Syrian nationalism (not to be confused with Arab nationalism). Stephen Sheehi states that al-Bustani's \\"importance does not lay in his prognosis of Arab culture or his national pride. Nor is his advocacy of discriminately adopting Western knowledge and technology to ‚Äúawaken‚Äù the Arabs‚Äô inherent ability for cultural success (najah) unique among his generation. Rather, his contribution lays in the act of elocution. That is, his writing articulates a specific formula for native progress that expresses a synthetic vision of the matrix of modernity within Ottoman Syria.\\"Stephen Sheehi, \\"Butrus al-Bustani: Syria's Ideologue of the Age,\\" in \\"The Origins of Syrian Nationhood: Histories, Pioneers, and Identity\\", edited by Adel Bishara.

dharma teachings to situations of social, political, environmental and economic suffering and injustice. Finding its roots in Vietnam through the Zen Buddhist teacher Th√≠ch Nh·∫•t H·∫°nh, Engaged Buddhism has grown in popularity in the West.  Origins  The term was coined by the Vietnamese Thi·ªÅn Buddhist teacher Th√≠ch Nh·∫•t H·∫°nh, inspired by the humanistic Buddhism reform movement in China by Taixu and Yinshun and later propagated in Taiwan by Cheng Yen and Hsing Yun. At first, he used Literary Chinese, the liturgical language of Vietnamese Buddhism, calling it in . During the Vietnam War, he and his sangha (spiritual community) made efforts to respond to the suffering they saw around them, in part by coopting the nonviolence activism of Mahatma Gandhi in India and of Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. in the United States to oppose the conflict. They saw this work as part of their meditation and mindfulness practice, not apart from it. Thich Nhat Hanh outlined fourteen precepts of engaged Buddhism, which explained his philosophy. As early as 1946, Walpola Rahula identified an explicit social ethos present in the earliest recorded Buddhist teachings, noting that the Buddha encouraged early monks to travel in order to benefit the largest number of people and that his discourses to lay people often included practical instructions on social and economic matters, rather than being purely concerned with philosophical or soteriological concerns.  Socially engaged Buddhism in the West  In the West, like the East, engaged Buddhism is a way of attempting to link authentic Buddhist practice‚Äîparticularly mindfulness‚Äîwith social action. It has two main centers from which its approach, spearheaded by Thich Nhat Hanh, is disseminated, namely the Plum Village monastic community in Loubes-Bernac, France and the Community of Mindful Living (CML) in Berkeley, California. Both centers are tied to Hanh's Unified Buddhist Church. Beside Hanh's efforts, the current Dalai Lama has voiced a need for Buddhists to be more involved in the socio- political realm: Some Christians have rallied in attempts of bringing peace and hope to those distressed in the midst of political and social tragedies. The intention of these evangelizing groups is not to evoke tension or violence among groups or individuals, or to force any solutions onto individuals, however their goal is to provide comfort and demonstrate acts of love and kindness. Organizations such as the Soka Gakkai International, Buddhist Peace Fellowship, Buddhist Global Relief, the International Network of Engaged Buddhists, the Zen Peacemakers led by Roshi Bernard Glassman and Thich Nhat Hanh's Order of Interbeing are devoted to building the movement of engaged Buddhists. Other engaged Buddhist groups include the Benevolent Organisation for Development, Health and Insight, Gaden Relief Projects, the UK's Network of Buddhist Organisations, Fo Guang Shan and Tzu Chi. Prominent figures in the movement include Robert Aitken Roshi, Joanna Macy, Gary Snyder, Alan Senauke, Sulak Sivaraksa, Daisaku Ikeda, Maha Ghosananda, Sylvia Wetzel, Joan Halifax, Tara Brach, Taigen Dan Leighton, Ken Jones, Jan Willis.

Established in Madrid in 1782 by Charles III, today the bank is a member of the European System of Central Banks and is also Spain's national competent authority for banking supervision within the Single Supervisory Mechanism. Its activity is regulated by the Bank of Spain Autonomy Act. History Originally named the Banco Nacional de San Carlos, it was founded in 1782 by Charles III in Madrid, to stabilize government finances through its state bonds (vales reales) following the American Revolutionary War in which Spain gave military and financial support to the Thirteen Colonies. Although it aided the state, the bank was initially owned privately by stockholders. Its assets included those of \\"Spanish capitalists, French rentiers, and surprisingly, several treasuries of Indian communities in New Spain\\" (colonial Mexico).Carlos Marichal, \\"Banco de San Carlos (Spain)\\", Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, Barbara A. Tenenbaum, ed. New YOrk: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1996.

Its first director was French banker Fran√ßois Cabarrus, known in Spain as Francisco Cabarr√∫s.Pedro Tedd, El Banco de San Carlos (1782‚Äì1829) (1988) Following the Napoleonic invasion of Spain during the peninsular war between 1808 and 1813, the bank was owed more than 300 million reales by the state, placing it in financial difficulty. Treasury minister Luis L√≥pez Ballesteros created a fund of 40 million reales in 1829 against which the bank could issue its own notes at Madrid. It did so after renaming itself Banco Espa√±ol de San Fernando because the name of the king was Fernando VII . In 1844 the competing Banco de Isabel II and Banco de Barcelona were established, followed in 1846 by the Banco de C√°diz. In 1847, following overexposure in the failing property market of Madrid, the Banco de Isabel II merged with Banco de San Fernando, retaining the latter name. Sight of the Bank of Spain Building, hosting the Banco de Espa√±a since 1891. Under the guidance of Ram√≥n Santill√°n in the 1850s, the bank extended its operations to the cities of Alicante and Valencia and took the name, Banco de Espa√±a. Requiring financial support from the bank to back its civil and colonial wars, the government of Spain granted the Banco de Espa√±a a monopoly on the issuance of Spanish bank notes in 1874. Construction of the bank's headquarters building began in 1884 at the crossing of the Calle de Alcal√° and the Paseo del Prado in Madrid. In 1936, 510 tonnes of gold reserves were transferred to the Soviet Union (in an event known as Moscow gold) corresponding to 72.6% of the total gold reserves of the Bank of Spain. That gold remained there during the Spanish Civil War. In 1946, the government of General Franco placed the bank under tight control. It was formally nationalised in 1962. Following the restoration of democracy in the late 1970s, the bank began a series of transformations and modernisations which continue to today. On Spain's entry into the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union in 1994, the Banco de Espa√±a became a member of the European System of Central Banks. The Bank of Spain holds 8,84% of the ECB's capital. Governing structures The governing structures of the Bank is divided among four branches: * The Governor. * The Deputy Governor. * The Governing Council. * The Executive Commission. The Governor of the Bank of Spain is formally appointed after the Prime Minister of Spain has designated him/her by the Spanish monarch. The Governor must be a Spanish citizen recognized for his or her competence in monetary or banking matters. When a new Governor is named, the Minister of Economy and Finance, in accord with procedure established by the Congress of Deputies, informs the competent parliamentary commission. The current Governor is Pablo Hern√°ndez de Cos. pesetas note with the image of Jos√© Echegaray and the Bank of Spain The tasks of the Governor include: * Direct the Bank and preside over the Governing Council and Executive Commission; * Take primary responsibility for the Bank's lawfully fulfilling its responsibilities. The Governor has ultimate responsibility authorizing bank contracts and other legal documents and for representing the Bank at justice tribunals; * Represent the Bank in international institutional dealings; * Function as a member of the Governing Council of the Bank and as a member of the General Council of the European System of Central Banks. The Deputy Governor, designated by the national Government on the recommendation of the Governor of the Bank, should meet all of the official qualifications for the governorship. The current Deputy Governor of the Bank of Spain is Margarita Delgado. The Deputy Governor substitutes for the Governor in cases of vacancy, absence or illness, both as director of the Bank and as its representative. Further responsibilities of this office are a matter internal to the Bank, and are delegated by the Governor. Six Bank Counsellors are named by the national Government, on the proposal of the Minister of Economy and Finance, with the involvement of the Governor of the Bank. They must be Spanish citizens recognized for their competence in economics or law. The Deputy Governor is in charge of seven directorates: * General Banking Supervision * General Cash and Branches * General Economics, Statistics and Research * General Financial Stability, Regulation and Resolution * General Operations, Markets and Payments Systems * General Service * General Secretariat The Executive Commission consists of: * The Governor, who presides; * The Deputy Governor; * Two Counsellors. The directors general of the Bank attend the meetings of the Executive Commission, with voice but without vote. The Secretary of the Bank functions as secretary of the Executive Commission, but without voice or vote. The two Counsellors who serve as members of the Executive Commission are designated by the Governing Council, after nomination by the Governor, from among their own members (other than ex officio members). The Governing Council consists of: * The Governor; * The Deputy Governor; * Six Counsellors; * The director general of the treasury and of financial policy; * The vice president of the Comisi√≥n Nacional Nacional del Mercado de Valores (\\"Stock Market National Commission\\").

SSADM was produced for the Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency, a UK government office concerned with the use of technology in government, from 1980 onwards.  Overview  SSADM is a waterfall method for the analysis and design of information systems. SSADM can be thought to represent a pinnacle of the rigorous document-led approach to system design, and contrasts with more contemporary agile methods such as DSDM or Scrum. SSADM is one particular implementation and builds on the work of different schools of structured analysis and development methods, such as Peter Checkland's soft systems methodology, Larry Constantine's structured design, Edward Yourdon's Yourdon Structured Method, Michael A. Jackson's Jackson Structured Programming, and Tom DeMarco's structured analysis. The names \\"Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method\\" and \\"SSADM\\" are registered trademarks of the Office of Government Commerce (OGC), which is an office of the United Kingdom's Treasury.  History  The principal stages of the development of Structured System Analysing And Design Methodology were: * 1980: Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency (CCTA) evaluate analysis and design methods. * 1981: Consultants working for Learmonth & Burchett Management Systems, led by John Hall, chosen to develop SSADM v1. * 1982: John Hall and Keith Robinson left to found Model Systems Ltd, LBMS later developed LSDM, their proprietary version. * 1983: SSADM made mandatory for all new information system developments * 1984: Version 2 of SSADM released * 1986: Version 3 of SSADM released, adopted by NCC * 1988: SSADM Certificate of Proficiency launched, SSADM promoted as ‚Äòopen‚Äô standard * 1989: Moves towards Euromethod, launch of CASE products certification scheme * 1990: Version 4 launched * 1993: SSADM V4 Standard and Tools Conformance Scheme * 1995: SSADM V4+ announced, V4.2 launched * 2000: CCTA renamed SSADM as \\"Business System Development\\". The method was repackaged into 15 modules and another 6 modules were added.  SSADM techniques  The three most important techniques that are used in SSADM are as follows: ; Logical Data Modelling : The process of identifying, modelling and documenting the data requirements of the system being designed. The result is a data model containing entities (things about which a business needs to record information), attributes (facts about the entities) and relationships (associations between the entities). ; Data Flow Modelling : The process of identifying, modelling and documenting how data moves around an information system. Data Flow Modeling examines processes (activities that transform data from one form to another), data stores (the holding areas for data), external entities (what sends data into a system or receives data from a system), and data flows (routes by which data can flow). ; Entity Event Modelling : A two-stranded process: Entity Behavior Modelling, identifying, modelling and documenting the events that affect each entity and the sequence (or life history) in which these events occur, and Event Modelling, designing for each event the process to coordinate entity life histories.  Stages  The SSADM method involves the application of a sequence of analysis, documentation and design tasks concerned with the following. = Stage 0 ‚Äì Feasibility study = In order to determine whether or not a given project is feasible, there must be some form of investigation into the goals and implications of the project. For very small scale projects this may not be necessary at all as the scope of the project is easily understood. In larger projects, the feasibility may be done but in an informal sense, either because there is no time for a formal study or because the project is a ‚Äúmust-have‚Äù and will have to be done one way or the other. A data flow Diagram is used to describe how the current system works and to visualize the known problems. When a feasibility study is carried out, there are four main areas of consideration: Technical ‚Äì is the project technically possible? Financial ‚Äì can the business afford to carry out the project? Organizational ‚Äì will the new system be compatible with existing practices? Ethical ‚Äì is the impact of the new system socially acceptable? To answer these questions, the feasibility study is effectively a condensed version of a comprehensive systems analysis and design. The requirements and usages are analyzed to some extent, some business options are drawn up and even some details of the technical implementation. The product of this stage is a formal feasibility study document. SSADM specifies the sections that the study should contain including any preliminary models that have been constructed and also details of rejected options and the reasons for their rejection. = Stage 1 ‚Äì Investigation of the current environment = The developers of SSADM understood that in almost all cases there is some form of current system even if it is entirely composed of people and paper. Through a combination of interviewing employees, circulating questionnaires, observations and existing documentation, the analyst comes to full understanding of the system as it is at the start of the project. This serves many purposes (Like examples?). = Stage 2 ‚Äì Business system options = Having investigated the current system, the analyst must decide on the overall design of the new system. To do this, he or she, using the outputs of the previous stage, develops a set of business system options. These are different ways in which the new system could be produced varying from doing nothing to throwing out the old system entirely and building an entirely new one. The analyst may hold a brainstorming session so that as many and various ideas as possible are generated. The ideas are then collected to options which are presented to the user. The options consider the following: *the degree of automation *the boundary between the system and the users *the distribution of the system, for example, is it centralized to one office or spread out across several? *cost/benefit *impact of the new system Where necessary, the option will be documented with a logical data structure and a level 1 data-flow diagram. The users and analyst together choose a single business option. This may be one of the ones already defined or may be a synthesis of different aspects of the existing options. The output of this stage is the single selected business option together with all the outputs of the feasibility stage. = Stage 3 ‚Äì Requirements specification = This is probably the most complex stage in SSADM. Using the requirements developed in stage 1 and working within the framework of the selected business option, the analyst must develop a full logical specification of what the new system must do. The specification must be free from error, ambiguity and inconsistency. By logical, we mean that the specification does not say how the system will be implemented but rather describes what the system will do. To produce the logical specification, the analyst builds the required logical models for both the data-flow diagrams (DFDs) and the Logical Data Model (LDM), consisting of the Logical Data Structure (referred to in other methods as entity relationship diagrams) and full descriptions of the data and its relationships. These are used to produce function definitions of every function which the users will require of the system, Entity Life-Histories (ELHs) which describe all events through the life of an entity, and Effect Correspondence Diagrams (ECDs) which describe how each event interacts with all relevant entities. These are continually matched against the requirements and where necessary, the requirements are added to and completed. The product of this stage is a complete requirements specification document which is made up of: *the updated data catalogue *the updated requirements catalogue *the processing specification which in turn is made up of :*user role/function matrix :*function definitions :*required logical data model :*entity life-histories :*effect correspondence diagrams ''' = Stage 4 ‚Äì Technical system options = This stage is the first towards a physical implementation of the new system. Like the Business System Options, in this stage a large number of options for the implementation of the new system are generated. This is narrowed down to two or three to present to the user from which the final option is chosen or synthesized. However, the considerations are quite different being: *the hardware architectures *the software to use *the cost of the implementation *the staffing required *the physical limitations such as a space occupied by the system *the distribution including any networks which that may require *the overall format of the human computer interface All of these aspects must also conform to any constraints imposed by the business such as available money and standardization of hardware and software. The output of this stage is a chosen technical system option. = Stage 5 ‚Äì Logical design = Though the previous level specifies details of the implementation, the outputs of this stage are implementation- independent and concentrate on the requirements for the human computer interface. The logical design specifies the main methods of interaction in terms of menu structures and command structures. One area of activity is the definition of the user dialogues. These are the main interfaces with which the users will interact with the system. Other activities are concerned with analyzing both the effects of events in updating the system and the need to make inquiries about the data on the system. Both of these use the events, function descriptions and effect correspondence diagrams produced in stage 3 to determine precisely how to update and read data in a consistent and secure way. The product of this stage is the logical design which is made up of: *Data catalogue *Required logical data structure *Logical process model ‚Äì includes dialogues and model for the update and inquiry processes *Stress & Bending moment. = Stage 6 ‚Äì Physical design= This is the final stage where all the logical specifications of the system are converted to descriptions of the system in terms of real hardware and software. This is a very technical stage and a simple overview is presented here. The logical data structure is converted into a physical architecture in terms of database structures. The exact structure of the functions and how they are implemented is specified. The physical data structure is optimized where necessary to meet size and performance requirements. The product is a complete Physical Design which could tell software engineers how to build the system in specific details of hardware and software and to the appropriate standards. References 5\\\\.

The fire was first spotted at 8:04 p.m., on April 19, 1904, by a Toronto Police constable on his regular street patrol. The flames were rising from the elevator shaft of the E & S Currie Limited's neck wear factory at 58 Wellington Street West, just west of Bay Street (now TD Bank Tower). The factory was situated in the centre of a large industrial and commercial area. The exact cause of the fire was never determined, but a faulty heating stove or an electrical problem is suspected. With 17 fire halls alerted, two engine companies and one hose company, the fire took nine hours to get under control. The glow of the fire could be seen for miles in all directions. Firefighters from cities as far away as Hamilton, Ontario, and Buffalo, New York, came to Toronto's aid. The temperature that night was approximately with winds at and snow flurries. The fire destroyed more than 100 buildings. Damage on Wellington Street West and Yonge Street was limited because one of the buildings, the Kilgour Brothers factory, had a sprinkler system fed by water tanks on the roof, preventing the fire from spreading in that direction. The fire claimed one victim, John Croft, who was an explosive expert clearing the ruins from the fire. It caused in damage and put five thousand people out of work; at the time the city had 200,000 inhabitants. As a result of the fire, more stringent safety laws were introduced and an expansion of the city's fire department was undertaken.

An archaeologist is employed by the developer to monitor the excavation of foundation and service trenches, landscaping and any other intrusive work. The developer undertakes to give the archaeologist sufficient time to identify and record any archaeological finds and features; however, the arrangement is rarely satisfactory for either party. It is often difficult, both intellectually and physically, to identify archaeological features in narrow foundation trenches and the potential delay to a project can also be difficult for a developer to incorporate into a development programme. Prior evaluation through trial trenching can overcome these problems by having the archaeology examined and removed or preserved before groundworks commence.

Hegel described the work as an \\"exposition of the coming to be of knowledge\\".Hegel 2018, p 468. This is explicated through a necessary self-origination and dissolution of \\"the various shapes of spirit as stations on the way through which spirit becomes pure knowledge\\".Hegel 2018, p 468. The book marked a significant development in German idealism after Immanuel Kant. Focusing on topics in metaphysics, epistemology, physics, ethics, history, religion, perception, consciousness, and political philosophy, it is where Hegel develops his concepts of dialectic (including the master‚Äìslave dialectic), absolute idealism, ethical life, and Aufhebung. It had a profound effect in Western philosophy, and \\"has been praised and blamed for the development of existentialism, communism, fascism, death of God theology, and historicist nihilism\\". Historical context Hegel was putting the finishing touches to this book as Napoleon engaged Prussian troops on October 14, 1806, in the Battle of Jena on a plateau outside the city. On the day before the battle, Napoleon entered the city of Jena. Later that same day Hegel wrote a letter to his friend the theologian Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer: > I saw the Emperor ‚Äì this world-soul ‚Äì riding out of the city on > reconnaissance. It is indeed a wonderful sensation to see such an > individual, who, concentrated here at a single point, astride a horse, > reaches out over the world and masters it ... this extraordinary man, whom > it is impossible not to admire. In 2000 Terry Pinkard notes that Hegel's comment to Niethammer \\"is all the more striking since at that point he had already composed the crucial section of the Phenomenology in which he remarked that the Revolution had now officially passed to another land (Germany) that would complete 'in thought' what the Revolution had only partially accomplished in practice.\\" Publication history The Phenomenology of Spirit was published with the title ‚ÄúSystem of Science: First Part: The Phenomenology of Spirit‚Äù.Hegel 2018, p xvi. Some copies contained either \\"Science of the Experience of Consciousness\\", or \\"Science of the Phenomenology of Spirit\\" as a subtitle between the \\"Preface\\" and the \\"Introduction\\".Hegel 2018, p. xvi. On its initial publication, the work was identified as Part One of a projected \\"System of Science\\", which would have contained the Science of Logic \\"and both the two real sciences of philosophy, the Philosophy of Nature and the Philosophy of Spirit‚ÄùHegel 2015, p. 21.9. as its second part. The Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences, in its third section (Philosophy of Spirit), contains a second subsection (The Encyclopedia Phenomenology) that recounts in briefer and somewhat altered form the major themes of the original Phenomenology. Structure The book consists of a Preface (written after the rest was completed), an Introduction, and six major divisions (of greatly varying size): \\"Consciousness\\", \\"Self-Consciousness\\", \\"Reason\\", \\"Spirit\\", \\"Religion\\", and \\"Absolute Knowledge\\". Most of these have further hierarchical subdivisions, and some versions of the book's table of contents also group the last four together as a single section on a level with the first two. Due to its obscure nature and the many works by Hegel that followed its publication, even the structure or core theme of the book itself remains contested. First, Hegel wrote the book under close time constraints with little chance for revision (individual chapters were sent to the publisher before others were written). Furthermore, according to some readers, Hegel may have changed his conception of the project over the course of the writing. Secondly, the book abounds with both highly technical argument in philosophical language, and concrete examples, either imaginary or historical, of developments by people through different states of consciousness. The relationship between these is disputed: whether Hegel meant to prove claims about the development of world history, or simply used it for illustration; whether or not the more conventionally philosophical passages are meant to address specific historical and philosophical positions; and so forth. Jean Hyppolite famously interpreted the work as a Bildungsroman that follows the progression of its protagonist, Spirit, through the history of consciousness, a characterization that remains prevalent among literary theorists. However, others contest this literary interpretation and instead read the work as a \\"self-conscious reflective account\\"Pinkard, Terry. (1996), p. 8. that a society must give of itself in order to understand itself and therefore become reflective. Martin Heidegger saw it as the foundation of a larger \\"System of Science\\" that Hegel sought to develop,Heidegger, Martin, Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit. while Alexandre Koj√®ve saw it as akin to a \\"Platonic Dialogue ... between the great Systems of history.\\"Koj√®ve, Alexandre, Introduction to the Reading of Hegel, ¬ß 1. It has also been called \\"a philosophical roller coaster ... with no more rhyme or reason for any particular transition than that it struck Hegel that such a transition might be fun or illuminating.\\"Pinkard, Terry. (1996), p. 2. =The Preface= The Preface to the text is a preamble to the scientific system and cognition in general. Subtitled ‚Äúon scientific cognition\\", its intent is to offer a rough idea on scientific cognition, and thus, making \\"any attempt to follow it out in detail . . . easier to grasp\\".Hegel 1977, p. 9. Tandem to this is the \\"opportunity to get rid of certain habits of thought which impede philosophical cognition\\".Hegel 1977, p. 9. As Hegel‚Äôs own announcement noted, it was to explain \\"what seems to him the need of philosophy in its present state; also about the presumption and mischief of the philosophical formulas that are currently degrading philosophy, and about what is altogether crucial in it and its study\\".Harris 1997, p. 30. It can thus be seen as a heuristic attempt at creating the need of philosophy (in the present state) and of what philosophy itself in its present state needs. This involves an exposition on the content and standpoint of philosophy, i.e, the true shape of truth and the element of its existence,Hegel 1977, p. 4. that is interspersed with polemics aimed at the presumption and mischief of philosophical formulas and what distinguishes it from that of any previous philosophy, especially that of his German Idealist predecessors (Kant, Fichte, and Schelling). The Hegelian method consists of actually examining consciousness' experience of both itself and of its objects and eliciting the contradictions and dynamic movement that come to light in looking at this experience. Hegel uses the phrase \\"pure looking at\\" (reines Zusehen) to describe this method. If consciousness just pays attention to what is actually present in itself and its relation to its objects, it will see that what looks like stable and fixed forms dissolve into a dialectical movement. Thus, philosophy, according to Hegel, cannot just set out arguments based on a flow of deductive reasoning. Rather, it must look at actual consciousness, as it really exists. Hegel also argues strongly against the epistemological emphasis of modern philosophy from Descartes through Kant, which he describes as having to first establish the nature and criteria of knowledge prior to actually knowing anything, because this would imply an infinite regress, a foundationalism that Hegel maintains is self-contradictory and impossible. Rather, he maintains, we must examine actual knowing as it occurs in real knowledge processes. This is why Hegel uses the term \\"phenomenology\\". \\"Phenomenology\\" comes from the Greek word for \\"to appear\\", and the phenomenology of mind is thus the study of how consciousness or mind appears to itself. In Hegel's dynamic system, it is the study of the successive appearances of the mind to itself, because on examination each one dissolves into a later, more comprehensive and integrated form or structure of mind. =Introduction= Whereas the Preface was written after Hegel completed the Phenomenology, the Introduction was written beforehand. It covers much of the same ground, but from a somewhat different perspective. In the Introduction, Hegel addresses the seeming paradox that we cannot evaluate our faculty of knowledge in terms of its ability to know the Absolute without first having a criterion for what the Absolute is, one that is superior to our knowledge of the Absolute. Yet, we could only have such a criterion if we already had the improved knowledge that we seek. To resolve this paradox, Hegel adopts a method whereby the knowing that is characteristic of a particular stage of consciousness is evaluated using the criterion presupposed by consciousness itself. At each stage, consciousness knows something, and at the same time distinguishes the object of that knowledge as different from what it knows. Hegel and his readers will simply \\"look on\\" while consciousness compares its actual knowledge of the object‚Äîwhat the object is \\"for consciousness\\"‚Äîwith its criterion for what the object must be \\"in itself\\". One would expect that, when consciousness finds that its knowledge does not agree with its object, consciousness would adjust its knowledge to conform to its object. However, in a characteristic reversal, Hegel explains that under his method, the opposite occurs. As just noted, consciousness' criterion for what the object should be is not supplied externally but rather by consciousness itself. Therefore, like its knowledge, the \\"object\\" that consciousness distinguishes from its knowledge is really just the object \\"for consciousness\\"‚Äîit is the object as envisioned by that stage of consciousness. Thus, in attempting to resolve the discord between knowledge and object, consciousness inevitably alters the object as well. In fact, the new \\"object\\" for consciousness is developed from consciousness' inadequate knowledge of the previous \\"object\\". Thus, what consciousness really does is to modify its \\"object\\" to conform to its knowledge. Then the cycle begins anew as consciousness attempts to examine what it knows about this new \\"object\\". The reason for this reversal is that, for Hegel, the separation between consciousness and its object is no more real than consciousness' inadequate knowledge of that object. The knowledge is inadequate only because of that separation. At the end of the process, when the object has been fully \\"spiritualized\\" by successive cycles of consciousness' experience, consciousness will fully know the object and at the same time fully recognize that the object is none other than itself. At each stage of development, Hegel, adds, \\"we\\" (Hegel and his readers) see this development of the new object out of the knowledge of the previous one, but the consciousness that we are observing does not. As far as it is concerned, it experiences the dissolution of its knowledge in a mass of contradictions, and the emergence of a new object for knowledge, without understanding how that new object has been born. =Consciousness= Consciousness is divided into three chapters: \\"Sense-Certainty\\", \\"Perception\\", and \\"Force and the Understanding\\". =Self- Consciousness= Self-Consciousness contains a preliminary discussion of Life and Desire, followed by two subsections: \\"Independent and Dependent Self- Consciousness: Lordship and Bondage\\" and \\"Freedom of Self-Consciousness: Stoicism, Skepticism, and the Unhappy Consciousness\\" (das ungl√ºckliche Bewu√ütsein). Notable is the presence of the discussion of the dialectic of the lord and bondsman. =Reason= Reason is divided into three chapters: \\"Observing Reason\\", \\"Actualization of Self-Consciousness\\", and \\"Individuality Real In and For Itself\\". =Spirit= Spirit or Geist is divided into three chapters: \\"The Ethical Order\\", \\"Culture\\", and \\"Morality\\". =Religion= Religion is divided into three chapters: \\"Natural Religion\\", \\"Religion in the Form of Art\\", and \\"The Revealed Religion\\". =Absolute Knowledge= Phenomenologys final chapter is titled \\"Absolute Knowing\\" (Miller translation) or \\"Absolute Knowledge\\" (Baillie translation). \\"Absolute Knowing,\\" for Hegel, is not to be confused with foundational knowledge, which is oxymoronic in Hegelian philosophy, instead, the Absolute is an endpoint of History, \\"spirit knowing itself as spirit\\" (¬ß808, p.467).Hegel, 2018 Hegelian dialectic The famous dialectical process of thesis‚Äìantithesis‚Äìsynthesis has been controversially attributed to Hegel. Regardless of (ongoing) academic controversy regarding the significance of a unique dialectical method in Hegel's writings, it is true, as Professor Howard Kainz (1996) affirms, that there are \\"thousands of triads\\" in Hegel's writings. Importantly, instead of using the famous terminology that originated with Kant and was elaborated by J. G. Fichte, Hegel used an entirely different and more accurate terminology for dialectical (or as Hegel called them, 'speculative') triads. Hegel used two different sets of terms for his triads, namely, abstract‚Äìnegative‚Äìconcrete (especially in his Phenomenology of 1807), as well as, immediate‚Äìmediate‚Äìconcrete (especially in his Science of Logic of 1812), depending on the scope of his argumentation. When one looks for these terms in his writings, one finds so many occurrences that it may become clear that Hegel employed the Kantian using a different terminology. Hegel explained his change of terminology. The triad terms, 'abstract‚Äìnegative‚Äìconcrete' contain an implicit explanation for the flaws in Kant's terms. The first term, 'thesis', deserves its anti-thesis simply because it is too abstract. The third term, 'synthesis', has completed the triad, making it concrete and no longer abstract, by absorbing the negative. Sometimes Hegel used the terms, immediate‚Äìmediate‚Äìconcrete, to describe his triads. The most abstract concepts are those that present themselves to our consciousness immediately. For example, the notion of Pure Being for Hegel was the most abstract concept of all. The negative of this infinite abstraction would require an entire Encyclopedia, building category by category, dialectically, until it culminated in the category of Absolute Mind or Spirit (since the German word, 'Geist', can mean either 'Mind' or 'Spirit').  Unfolding of species  Hegel describes a sequential progression from inanimate objects to animate creatures to human beings. This is frequently compared to Charles Darwin's evolutionary theory. However, unlike Darwin, Hegel thought that organisms had agency in choosing to develop along this progression by collaborating with other organisms. Hegel understood this to be a linear process of natural development with a predetermined end. He viewed this end teleologically as its ultimate purpose and destiny.  Identities, differences and arguments logically expressed  Spirit = revealed Totality of Being = ((subjective) Revelation + (objective) Being) = (Knowledge + Real) = (Subject + Object)Spirit, or Geist, is always an endpoint, or a 'becoming'. Although determinist, for Hegel, the becoming of Spirit can only be traced a posteriori and not predicted. System = Subject<->Object [Subject reveals Object, Subject is revealed in Object] Self = Time'Time' and 'Space' are absolutely key concepts here. Though Hegel uses them in slightly unfamiliar ways. He uses these terms to displace more established philosophies of 'Subject' and 'Object'. (Koj√©ve, 1980) = ManUnfortunately, it is difficult to straightforwardly remove the universal masculine from Hegel's thought.

Criticism Arthur Schopenhauer criticized Phenomenology of Spirit as being characteristic of the vacuous verbiage he attributed to Hegel.; Walter Kaufmann, on the question of organisation argued that Hegel's arrangement \\"over half a century before Darwin published his Origin of Species and impressed the idea of evolution on almost everybody's mind, was developmental.\\" The idea is supremely suggestive but in the end, untenable according to Kaufmann: \\"The idea of arranging all significant points of view in such a single sequence, on a ladder that reaches from the crudest to the most mature, is as dazzling to contemplate as it is mad to try seriously to implement it\\".Kaufmann, Walter Arnold (1965). p. 149. While Kaufmann viewed Hegel as right in seeing that the way a view is reached is not necessarily external to the view itself; since on the contrary a knowledge of the development, including the prior positions, through which a human being passed before adopting a position may make all the difference when it comes to comprehending his or her position, some aspects of the conception are still somewhat absurd and some of the details bizarre.Kaufmann, Walter Arnold (1965). p. 149. Kaufmann also remarks that the very table of contents of the Phenomenology may be said to 'mirror confusion' and that \\"faults are so easy to find in it that it is not worth while to adduce heaps of them.\\" However, he excuses Hegel since he understands that the author of the Phenomenology \\"finished the book under an immense strain\\".Kaufmann, Walter Arnold (1965). p. 152.

Career He started out his musical career in 1995 as a member of the Scare Dem Crew, later continuing as a solo artist. He was later characterised for several trademarks, such as his dyed yellow-orange hair, his unique low-key voice, and his stage performance, which included jumping and running, or even climbing on stage props and monitors. His acoustic trademark is a light lisp. Bryan had his first international recognition when he and Puma settled a contract for using his single \\"All Out\\" for its Olympics commercial campaign in 2004. His song \\"Willie Bounce\\" appeared on several mixtapes in early 2006. It used the first few bars from \\"I Will Survive\\" by Gloria Gaynor. \\"Willie Bounce\\" has been described as one of Elephant Man's most recognizable songs, with the corresponding dance still enjoying popularity as of 2015. Bryan signed with New York-based label Bad Boy Records and released Let's Get Physical on 6 November 2007. The first single was called \\"Five-O\\" and featured Wyclef Jean. Another track on the album featured Diddy and Busta Rhymes, and it was produced by Cipha Sounds and Solitair. Many of Elephant Man's songs are found on various Riddim Driven albums by VP Records and Greensleeves Records's Rhythm Album series. He performed on popular riddims such as \\"Diwali\\", \\"Coolie\\", \\"Stepz\\", and \\"Bubble Up\\". The Gully Creeper dance, for which Bryan created a song, was danced by Usain Bolt at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing after winning the gold medal and breaking a world record in the 200 meter sprint. In 2009, Elephant Man released a cover of the song \\"We Are The World\\" in tribute to Michael Jackson. He also plays one of the following song \\"Ooo La La La\\" by Teena Marie. In 2013 he did a cover of Eminem's song \\"Berzerk\\". Also he first appeared on BET Awards where he sang with Beenie Man. He was invited to sing on the album Free the Universe by Major Lazer, where he collaborated for the song \\"Wind Up\\". On Jamaican Cribs, his house was featured, displaying its 20 rooms, 1 bar, 4 chefs, 1 Jacuzzi, 1 shark, 15 dogs, 1 pool, 6 rabbits, and 1 disco club. It was named one of the largest houses in Jamaica. Legal issues Elephant Man, Ruhr Reggae Summer 2014. Bryan has been criticised for his lyrics calling for violence against gay people. In 2003, British LGBT group OutRage! called for the arrest and prosecution of several dancehall stars including Elephant Man, Bounty Killer and Beenie Man for violation of hate crimes statutes. In 2004, he was dropped from the MOBO awards. Since then pressure from his record company and agreement with gay rights groups to avoid songs with lyrics deemed to incite homophobic violence have allowed him to perform in the UK. In 2009, his scheduled appearance at Toronto's Caribana festival was cancelled for similar reasons.Reggae's Elephant Man nixed from Toronto concert, CBC News A concert in Munich was cancelled in February 2015 after LGBT rights groups had asked the police to make sure he would not perform songs which call upon people to murder gays. In January 2012, Bryan was arrested and charged with the rape and grievous sexual assault of a 31-year-old woman who accused him of assaulting her in his home in St. Andrew. In February 2016, the case was dropped due to the death of the complainant.\\"Elephant Man Beats Rape Rap\\", Jamaica Observer, 10 February 2016. Retrieved 14 February 2016 In March 2020, Jamaican authorities charged Elephant Man after it was alleged that he intentionally failed to declare his travel to Germany in order to avoid being quarantined in efforts to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic from countries that were on a restricted travel list. Elephant Man later apologized for the incident.

Its genome has been sequenced and a study has shown several genes can generate enzymes for degrading skin and proteins that may be immunogenic (activating the immune system). The species is largely commensal and part of the skin flora present on most healthy adult humans' skin. It is usually just barely detectable on the skin of healthy preadolescents. It lives, among other things, primarily on fatty acids in sebum secreted by sebaceous glands in the follicles. It may also be found throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Originally identified as Bacillus acnes, it was later named Propionibacterium acnes for its ability to generate propionic acid. In 2016, P. acnes was taxonomically reclassified as a result of biochemical and genomic studies. In terms of both phylogenetic tree structure and DNA G + C content, the cutaneous species was distinguishable from other species that had been previously categorized as P. acnes. As part of restructuring, the novel genus Cutibacterium was created for the cutaneous species, including those formerly identified as Propionibacterium acnes, Propionibacterium avidum, and Propionibacterium granulosum. Characterization of phylotypes of C. acnes is an active field of research. Role in disease C. acnes bacteria predominantly live deep within follicles and pores, although they are also found on the surface of healthy skin. In these follicles, C. acnes bacteria use sebum, cellular debris and metabolic byproducts from the surrounding skin tissue as their primary sources of energy and nutrients. Elevated production of sebum by hyperactive sebaceous glands (sebaceous hyperplasia) or blockage of the follicle can cause C. acnes bacteria to grow and multiply. C. acnes bacteria secrete many proteins, including several digestive enzymes. These enzymes are involved in the digestion of sebum and the acquisition of other nutrients. They can also destabilize the layers of cells that form the walls of the follicle. The cellular damage, metabolic byproducts and bacterial debris produced by the rapid growth of C. acnes in follicles can trigger inflammation. This inflammation can lead to the symptoms associated with some common skin disorders, such as folliculitis and acne vulgaris. The damage caused by C. acnes and the associated inflammation make the affected tissue more susceptible to colonization by opportunistic bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus. Preliminary research shows healthy pores are only colonized by C. acnes, while unhealthy ones universally include the nonpore- resident Staphylococcus epidermidis, amongst other bacterial contaminants. Whether this is a root causality, just opportunistic and a side effect, or a more complex pathological duality between C. acnes and this particular Staphylococcus species is not known. C. acnes has also been found in corneal ulcers, and is a common cause of chronic endophthalmitis following cataract surgery. Rarely, it infects heart valves leading to endocarditis, and infections of joints (septic arthritis) have been reported. Furthermore, Cutibacterium species have been found in ventriculostomy insertion sites, and areas subcutaneous to suture sites in patients who have undergone craniotomy. It is a common contaminant in blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures. C. acnes has been found in herniated discs. The propionic acid which it secretes creates micro-fractures of the surrounding bone. These micro-fractures are sensitive and it has been found that antibiotics have been helpful in resolving this type of low back pain. C. acnes can be found in bronchoalveolar lavage of approximately 70% of patients with sarcoidosis and is associated with disease activity, but it can be also found in 23% of controls. The subspecies of C. acnes that cause these infections of otherwise sterile tissues (prior to medical procedures), however, are the same subspecies found on the skin of individuals who do not have acne-prone skin, so are likely local contaminants. Moderate to severe acne vulgaris appears to be more often associated with virulent strains. C. acnes is an opportunistic pathogen, causing a range of postoperative and device-related infections e.g., surgery,Haidar R., Najjar M., Boghossian A.D., Tabbarah Z., \\"Propionibacterium acnes causing delayed postoperative spine infection: Review.\\" Scandinavian Journal of Infectious Diseases. 42 (6-7) (pp 405-411), 2010 post-neurosurgical infection,Nisbet, M.; Briggs, S.; Ellis-Pegler, R.; Thomas, M. ;Holland, D. \\"Propionibacterium acnes: an under-appreciated cause of post-neurosurgical infection\\" Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy. 60(5).

Antimicrobial susceptibility C. acnes bacteria are susceptible to a wide range of antimicrobial molecules, from both pharmaceutical and natural sources. Antibiotics are commonly used to treat infections caused by C. acnes. Acne vulgaris is the disease most commonly associated with C. acnes infection. The antibiotics most frequently used to treat acne vulgaris are erythromycin, clindamycin, doxycycline, and minocycline. Several other families of antibiotics are also active against C. acnes bacteria, including quinolones, cephalosporins, pleuromutilins, penicillins, and sulfonamides. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant C. acnes bacteria represents a growing problem worldwide. The problem is especially pronounced in North America and Europe. The antibiotic families that C. acnes are most likely to acquire resistance to are the macrolides (e.g., erythromycin and azithromycin), lincosamides (e.g., clindamycin) and tetracyclines (e.g., doxycycline and minocycline). However, C. acnes bacteria are susceptible to many types of antimicrobial chemicals found in over-the-counter antibacterial products, including benzoyl peroxide, triclosan, chloroxylenol, and chlorhexidine gluconate. Several naturally occurring molecules and compounds are toxic to C. acnes bacteria. Some essential oils such as rosemary,Fu, Yujie; Zu, Yuangang; Chen, Liyan [Author]; Efferth, Thomas; Liang, Huili; Liu, Zhiguo; Liu, Wei \\"Investigation of antibacterial activity of rosemary essential oil against propionibacterium acnes with atomic force microscopy\\"Planta Medica. 73(12).

The elements silver, sulfur, and copper have also been demonstrated to be toxic towards many bacteria, including C. acnes. Photosensitivity C. acnes glows orange when exposed to blacklight, possibly due to the presence of endogenous porphyrins. It is also killed by ultraviolet light. C. acnes is especially sensitive to light in the 405-420 nanometer (near the ultraviolet) range due to an endogenic porphyrin- coporphyrin III. A total irradiance of 320 Joules/cm2 inactivates this species in vitro. Its photosensitivity can be enhanced by pretreatment with aminolevulinic acid, which boosts production of this chemical, although this causes significant side effects in humans, and in practice was not significantly better than the light treatment alone. Other habitats C. acnes has been found to be an endophyte of plants. Notably, grapevine appears to host an endophytic population of C. acnes that is closely related to the human-associated strains. The two lines diverged roughly 7,000 years ago, at about the same time when grapevine agriculture may have been established. This C. acnes subtype was dubbed Zappae in honour of the eccentric composer Frank Zappa, to highlight its unexpected and unconventional habitat.

The origins of the British peerage are obscure but while the ranks of baron and earl perhaps predate the British peerage itself, the ranks of duke and marquess were introduced to England in the 14th century. The rank of viscount came later, in the mid-15th century. Peers were summoned to Parliament, forming the House of Lords. The unions of England and Scotland to form Great Britain in 1707, and of Great Britain and Ireland to form the United Kingdom in 1801, led successively to the establishment of the Peerages of Great Britain and later of the United Kingdom, and the discontinuation of creations in the Peerages of England and Scotland. Scottish and Irish peers did not have an automatic right to sit in the House of Lords, and instead elected representative peers from amongst their number. Peerages were largely hereditary until the regular creation of life peers began in the second half of the 20th century. The last creation of a non-royal hereditary peer occurred in 1984; even then it was considered unusual. Life peers and 92 hereditary peers still retain the right to sit and vote in the House of Lords, though their power is restricted and further reform of the House of Lords is under consideration. Feudal origins The hereditary peerage, as it now exists, combines several different English institutions with analogous ones from Scotland and Ireland. English Earls are an Anglo-Saxon institution. Wessex was Shired by the 9th century, and the Shire system was extended to the rest of England as the Kings of Wessex unified the country. Each Shire was governed by an Ealdorman. Around 1014, English shires or counties were grouped into Earldoms, each was led by a local great man, called an earl; the same man could be earl of several shires. When the Normans conquered England, they continued to appoint earls, but not for all counties; the administrative head of the county became the sheriff. Earldoms began as offices, with a perquisite of a share of the legal fees in the county; they gradually became honours, with a stipend of ¬£20 a year; like most feudal offices, they were inherited, but the kings frequently asked earls to resign or exchange earldoms. Usually there were few Earls in England, and they were men of great wealth in the shire from which they held title, or an adjacent one, but it depended on circumstances: during the civil war between Stephen and the Empress Matilda, nine Earls were created in three years. There were no Dukes made between William the Conqueror and Henry II; they were themselves only Dukes in France. When Edward III of England declared himself King of France, he made his sons Dukes, to distinguish them from other noblemen, much as Royal Dukes are now distinguished from other Dukes. Later Kings created Marquesses and Viscounts to make finer gradations of honour: a rank something more than an Earl and something less than an Earl, respectively. When Henry III or Edward I wanted money or advice from his subjects, he would order great churchmen, earls, and other great men to come to his Great Council; he would generally order the lesser men from towns and counties to gather and pick some men to represent them. For the evolution of this into a system of government, see Parliament; the English Order of Barons has evolved from those men who were individually ordered to attend Parliament, but held no other title; the chosen representatives, on the other hand, became the House of Commons. This order, called a writ, was not originally hereditary, or even a privilege; the recipient had to come to the Great Council at his own expense, vote on taxes on himself and his neighbors, acknowledge that he was the king's tenant-in-chief (which might cost him special taxes), and risked involvement in royal politics - or the king requesting a personal loan, or benevolence. Which men were ordered to Council varied from Council to Council; a man might be so ordered once, and never again - or all his life, but his son and heir might never go. Under Henry VI of England, in the fifteenth century, just before the Wars of the Roses, attendance at Parliament became more valuable. The first claim of hereditary right to a writ comes from this reign; so does the first patent, or charter declaring a man to be a Baron; and the five orders began to be called Peers; holders of older peerages also began receive greater honour than Peers of the same rank just created. If a man held a peerage, his son would succeed to it; if he had no children, his brother would succeed. If he had a single daughter, his son-in-law would inherit the family lands, and usually the same Peerage; more complex cases were decided depending on circumstances. Customs changed with time; Earls were the first to be hereditary, and three different rules can be traced for the case of an Earl who left no sons and several married daughters. In the thirteenth century, the husband of the eldest daughter inherited the Earldom automatically; in the fifteenth century, the Earldom reverted to the Crown, who might regrant it (often to the eldest son-in-law); in the seventeenth century, it wouldn't be inherited by anybody unless all but one of the daughters died and left no descendants, in which case the remaining daughter (or her heir) would inherit. After Henry II became the Lord of Ireland, he and his successors began to imitate the English system as it was in their time. Irish Earls were first created in the thirteenth century, and Irish Parliaments began in the fifteenth century, complete with seven Barons of Parliament. The Irish peers were in a peculiar political position; because they were subjects of the King of England, but peers in a different kingdom, they could sit in the English House of Commons, and many did. In the eighteenth century, Irish peerages became rewards for English politicians, limited only by the concern that they might go to Dublin and interfere with the Irish Government. Scotland and Ireland Scotland evolved a similar system, differing in points of detail. The first Scottish Earldoms derive from the seven mormaers, of immemorial antiquity; they were named Earls by Queen Margaret. The Parliament of Scotland is as old as the English; the Scottish equivalent of baronies are called lordships of Parliament. The Acts of Union 1707, between England and Scotland, provided that future peerages should be peers of Great Britain, and the rules covering the peers should follow the English model; because there were proportionately many more Scottish peers, they chose a number of representatives to sit in the British House of Lords. The Acts of Union 1800 changed this to peers of the United Kingdom, but provided that Irish peerages could still be created; but the Irish peers were concerned that their honours would be diluted as cheap prizes, and insisted that an Irish peerage be created only when three Irish peerages had gone extinct (until there were only 100 Irish peers left). In the early nineteenth century, Irish creations were as frequent as this allowed; but only three have been created since 1863, and none since 1898. Plantagenet and Tudor monarchs The manner of summoning barons to the Council was influential in the development of the Peerage. Ecclesiastical dignitaries and the greater barons were summoned by a writ of summons issued directly from the King, while lesser barons were summoned through the local sheriffs. Such a system existed as early as 1164, when Henry II withheld a personal summons to Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, after engaging with him in a conflict with over the rights of the Church, instead subjecting him to a summons through a sheriff. For the rest of the twelfth century, the dividing line between barons summoned by writs personally addressed to them and barons summoned through the sheriffs became well-defined, but the Crown sometimes arbitrarily subjected the greater barons to summons through sheriffs. In the Magna Carta, King John declared, \\"we will cause to be summoned the archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, and greater barons, severally by our letters.\\" He also agreed that the lesser barons would be \\"summoned generally, through our sheriffs and bailiffs.\\" The greater barons continued to be regularly summoned to the King's Council. In 1254, the lesser barons ceased to attend the Council, instead being represented by knights, two of whom were chosen by each shire. The Council eventually developed into the modern Parliament. In 1295, the Model Parliament was called; the greater barons and prelates were summoned individually, while each shire elected two knights and each sufficiently populous city elected two burgesses. The prelates and barons eventually formed the House of Lords, while the knights and burgesses became the House of Commons. The Peerage, still, was not an hereditary body. Kings did not consider themselves, having once summoned an individual, bound to summon the same individual, much less his heirs, to future Parliaments. Thus, writs were issued at the whim of the King. Over time, however, the arbitrary power of the Crown was fettered by the principles of hereditary right. At first, the writ of summons was regarded as a burden and interference, but later, when Parliament's power increased, it was seen as a sign of royal favour. Since the Crown was itself an hereditary dignity, it seemed natural for seats in the upper House of Parliament to be so as well. By the beginning of the fourteenth century, the Peerage had evolved its hereditary characteristics. Since under Norman customs, estates devolved under the principles of primogeniture, seats in Parliament did so as well. Barons sat in Parliament by a combination of tenure and writs of summons issued to them. If a woman held a barony, her husband was summoned to Parliament in her right. The concept of a barony as a personal dignity not tied to land arose only when, in about 1388, Richard II created John Beauchamp a baron by letters patent. The Lord de Beauchamp was a baron not by tenure but rather by the will of the Crown. Letters patent and writs of summons were both used to create peerage dignities until the reign of Henry VIII, when the latter method fell into desuetude. Some peerage dignities, however, have since been created by writs of summons since that time. In most cases, such peerage dignities were created when a writ was issued to an individual under the misapprehension that he was entitled to a peerage dignity created by letters patent. The Barony of Strange is an example of a peerage dignity created due to an error. Edward, the Black Prince, Duke of Cornwall was the first Duke created in England. Depicted is the effigy above his tomb at Canterbury Cathedral Earls appear to have sat in Parliament by virtue of their baronies, and not their earldoms. The separation of the two dignities seems to have arisen after the advent of the usage of letters patent to create peerage dignities. In some cases, a baron who held a dignity created by a writ of summons was created an Earl, and the two dignities later separated, the barony devolving upon the heir-general, and the earldom to an heir-male. At first, earls and barons were the only ranks in the peerage. The other ranks of the Peerage developed in the fourteenth and fifteenth century. In 1337, Edward, the Black Prince was created Duke of Cornwall, taking precedence over all earls. Dukedoms were reserved for members of the Royal Family until 1387, when Robert de Vere, 9th Earl of Oxford, the favourite of Richard II, was created Duke of Ireland for life. De Vere had previously been created Marquess of Dublin for life, making him the first person to hold a dignity of such a rank between Dukes and Earls. Subsequent marquessates were created rarely; the Marquess of Winchester, whose dignity was created in 1551, is the only English marquess without a dukedom. The rank of viscount was introduced from Europe in 1440, when John, Baron Beaumont, was created Viscount Beaumont, with precedence between earls and barons. During the reign of Henry VIII, peers attempted to consolidate and secure their position. They declared themselves \\"ennobled in blood,\\" and suggested that no peerage could be extinguished except by an Act of Parliament, upon the extinction of all heirs to it, or upon forfeiture for treason or felony. The Spiritual Lords had attempted to secure the privileges of the Peerage while maintaining their ecclesiastical privileges, but lost in both attempts. Nonetheless, they were in the majority in the House of Lords until the Dissolution of the Monasteries, which removed the abbots and priors from the House. Thereafter, the temporal peers formed for the first time a majority in the Lords. Stuart monarchs In 1603, James VI of Scotland became King James I of England. Scotland's Peerage then became subject to many of the same principles as the English Peerage, though many peculiarities of Scottish law continue to apply to it today. Scotland, like England, had lesser and greater barons, as well as earls. There was but one Duke in Scotland: the Duke of Rothesay, the heir-apparent to the Crown. The weak nature of the Scottish Crown had permitted the lesser feudal barons to continue attending the Scottish Estates, or Parliament, until the fifteenth century. Thereafter, only Earls and Lords of Parliament (the greater barons) came to be summoned to the Estates. In Scotland, the peerage remained tied to land until after the Union. Every earldom or lordship of Parliament was accompanied by a grant of land; sometimes, peerages and their associated lands were surrendered in return for other peerages and lands. After the Union of the Crowns, however, the concept of the Peerage as a personal dignity, not a dignity affixed to land, became established in Scotland. James I had poor relations with the English Parliament, which had been less submissive than the Scottish Estates that he had been accustomed to. To raise funds without taxation, James began to sell titles. For instance, individuals paying ¬£1095 could obtain the non-peerage hereditary dignity of baronet. Even peerage dignities were sold. Thus, James I added sixty-two peers to a body that had included just fifty-nine members at the commencement of his reign. His Stuart successors were no less profuse. created twelve peers on one day. The position of the Peerage was called into question after the English Revolution that overthrew Charles I. In 1648, the House of Commons passed an Act abolishing the House of Lords, \\"finding by too long experience that the House of Lords is useless and dangerous to the people of England.\\" The Peerage was not abolished, and peers became entitled to be elected to the sole remaining House of Parliament. Oliver Cromwell, the de facto dictator, later found it convenient to re-establish a second chamber to reduce the power of the Commons. About sixty writs of summons, resembling those issued to peers sitting in the House of Lords, were issued. The individuals so summoned were called Lords, but their dignities were not hereditary. But soon after the establishment of this body, Cromwell dissolved Parliament, taking power into his own hands as Lord Protector. Soon after Cromwell's death, the monarchy was restored, as was the House of Lords. King Charles II continued the Stuart tendency of profusely creating peerages, even eclipsing the figures of James I's reign. Several of those dignities went to Charles' many mistresses and illegitimate sons. Charles II's reign was also marked by the persecution of Roman Catholics after Titus Oates falsely suggested that there was a \\"Popish Plot\\" to murder the King. Catholic peers were hindered from the House of Lords because they were forced, before taking their seats, to recite a declaration that denounced some of the Roman Church's doctrines as \\"superstitious and idolatrous.\\" These provisions would not be repealed until 1829. The next major event in the history of the Peerage occurred in 1707, when England and Scotland united into Great Britain. There were, at the time, one hundred and sixty-eight English peers and one hundred and fifty-four Scottish ones.Farnborough, T. E. May, 1st Baron (1896). Constitutional History of England since the Accession of George the Third, 11th ed. Volume I, Chapter 5, pp.273‚Äì281. London: Longmans, Green and Co. English peers did not wish for their individual significance in the House of Lords to dwindle, so they agreed to permit Scotland to elect just sixteen representative peers to sit in the House of Lords (see Parliament and the Peerage). After the Union, creations in both the Peerage of England and the Peerage of Scotland ceased and all new peerages were created in the Peerage of Great Britain. The individual power of peers did, however, reduce as more peerages were created. At one point, Anne created twelve peers in one day. The Tory government requested these ceations, known as Harley's Dozen, in order to secure a majority for their Peace policy in a previously Whig-dominated House. In response to the increase in creations, the House of Lords proposed a bill to restrict its numbers in 1719, but the Peerage Bill failed in the House of Commons. Hanoverian monarchs Parliament passed the Act of Settlement 1701, which devolved the Crown, after Anne's death, upon George, Elector of Hanover, the Queen's closest Protestant relative, bypassing about 50 others in the line of succession. As the power of the monarch slowly shifted to Parliament, peerage dignities came to be conferred at the behest of ministers, not at the pleasure of the Crown. King George III's reign is of particular note in the history of the Peerage. Increases to the Peerage during the time were totally unprecedented: almost four hundred peers were created during his reign.Farnborough, Lord (1896). Volume I, pp.281‚Äì290. Lord North and William Pitt the Younger were especially liberal in dispensing peerage dignities, a device used to obtain majorities in the House of Lords. It became apparent that the representation of Scottish peers was inadequate: they had continued to elect but sixteen peers, while the number of British peers had increased tremendously. To account for this deficiency in representation, British hereditary peerages were granted to Scottish peers, thereby entitling them to sit in the House of Lords. In 1801, Ireland united with Great Britain to form the United Kingdom. Ireland became entitled to elect twenty-eight of their number to sit in the House of Lords as representative peers. Unlike the Union of Scotland and England, the Crown retained the right to create one new Irish peerage dignity every time three previous ones became extinct, until the number of Irish peers without British peerages amounted to one hundred, when further creations would be permitted as often as necessary to maintain that number. Since Irish peers were not automatically entitled to representation in the Lords, individuals could be created Irish peers so as to honour them without further swelling the numbers of the House of Lords. There were only 21 creations of new Irish peerages after the Union; all other new peerages since 1801 have been created in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. In 1832, the Reform Act was passed, abolishing many of England's \\"rotten\\" boroughs, an example of which was Old Sarum, with an electorate of seven. Such small boroughs were often \\"owned\\" by peers, whose nominees were almost always elected. The Reform Act and further Acts reduced the influence of peers in the lower house, and therefore their overall political power. An important development of the nineteenth century was the Law Lord. In 1856, it was deemed necessary to add a legally qualified peer to the House of Lords: the Lords exercised, and still exercise, certain judicial functions, but did not necessarily include a sufficient number of peers well- versed in law. So that the number of hereditary peers would not be further increased, Victoria made Sir James Parke, a baron of the Exchequer, a life peer as Baron Wensleydale. The Lords refused to admit him, deeming that nothing but an Act of Parliament could change the fundamental hereditary characteristic of the Lords. Bills were later introduced to permit the creation of life peerages, but these failed.Farnborough, Lord (1896). Volume I, pp.290‚Äì299. Only in 1876, twenty years after the Wensleydale case, was the Appellate Jurisdiction Act passed, authorising the appointment of two Lords of Appeal in Ordinary (commonly called Law Lords) to sit in the House of Lords as barons. They were to hold the rank of baron for life, but sit in the Lords only until retiring from judicial office. In 1887, they were permitted to continue to sit in the Lords for life; the number of Lords of Appeal in Ordinary was also increased by further enactments. Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Windsor monarchs In the twentieth century, peers were almost always created to reward political merit, and creations became much more common. The peerage ceased to be associated with wealth or land ownership. At the beginning of the century, however, such associations remained for some time. In 1909, Chancellor of the Exchequer David Lloyd George proposed the introduction of a land tax, which the landowning peers opposed. The House of Lords rejected the budget. After the general election of January 1910, the returned government introduced the Parliament Bill, which sought to curtail the powers of the Lords. When the Lords attempted to block the bill, the prime minister, H. H. Asquith, threatened to have the king create two hundred and fifty new Liberal peers to neutralise the Conservative majority in the House of Lords. The Lords then passed the Parliament Act, which provides that most bills can only be delayed, not rejected, by the House of Lords. Later in the same decade, the Titles Deprivation Act 1917 was passed. Some British peers had fought against the British in World War I; the act permitted the suspension of their titles. In 1919, three peers‚ÄîPrince Charles Edward, Duke of Albany, Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland and Henry Taaffe, 12th Viscount Taaffe‚Äîhad their peerage dignities suspended. The successors to those dignities may petition for their restoration, but none has chosen to do so. Another issue of the 1920s was the admission of women to the House of Lords. The Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919 provided that \\"A person shall not be disqualified by sex or marriage from the exercise of any public function.\\" In 1922, the Viscountess Rhondda, a suo jure peeress, attempted to take a seat in the House of Lords. Though the Law Lords declared that she was, under the act, eligible, Lady Rhondda was not admitted by a decision of the committee for privileges. Many Conservatives were opposed to admitting women to the House of Lords. Liberals, meanwhile, felt that admitting hereditary peeresses would extend the hereditary principle which they so detested. Women were eventually admitted to the House of Lords in 1958. The Life Peerages Act passed that year permitted the creation of life baronies for both men and women on a regular basis. Hereditary peeresses were admitted in 1963 under the Peerage Act. The Peerage Act also permitted peers to disclaim hereditary peerages within a year of succeeding to them, or within a year of attaining the age of majority. All eligible Scottish peers were permitted to sit in the House of Lords, and elections for representative peers ceased. Elections for Irish representative peers had already ended in 1922, when most of Ireland left the United Kingdom to become the Irish Free State. Hereditary peerages continued to be created after 1958 but when Harold Wilson, of the Labour Party, became prime minister in 1964 he ceased to recommend the creation of hereditary peerages and neither of his successors, Edward Heath (of the Conservative Party) and James Callaghan (of the Labour Party), recommended hereditary peerage creations. Since then, hereditary peerages have not been regularly created outside of members of the royal family. Margaret Thatcher, a Conservative, did revive the practice of creating hereditary peers while she was prime minister: Harold Macmillan became Earl of Stockton in 1984, George Thomas became Viscount Tonypandy, and William Whitelaw became Viscount Whitelaw, both in 1983. The peerages of the latter two became extinct upon their deaths; the Earldom of Stockton survives. Thatcher's husband received an hereditary baronetcy, but she herself was created a life baroness on recommendation of her successor, John Major. Hereditary peerages continue to be created for members of the royal family. Prince Andrew was created Duke of York in 1986, Prince Edward was created Earl of Wessex in 1999, Prince William was created Duke of Cambridge in 2011, and Prince Harry was created Duke of Sussex in 2018 (all on the occasion of their marriages). After the Labour Party came to power in 1997, it began further reform of the House of Lords. Under the House of Lords Act 1999, hereditary peerages do not entitle individuals to seats in the House of Lords. The Act did provide exemptions for the Earl Marshal, the Lord Great Chamberlain and ninety others elected by the peers. Further reform of the Lords is under consideration.

Possessing an all-metal structure, metal-covering, and high-mounted gull wing, the type held the distinction of being widely considered to have briefly been the most advanced fighter aircraft of its kind in the world. The design of the P.11 commenced during the late 1920s, initially designated as the P.1. The primary individual responsible for its development was Polish aeronautical engineer Zygmunt Pu≈Çawski, who has been attributed as having designed many of its innovative features. While the majority of the world's forces were still using biplanes, the P.1 used a high-mounted and aerodynamically clean gull wing, which provided the pilot with a superior field of view. During September 1929, the first prototype conducted its maiden flight. The design quickly drew international attention; the general layout became commonly known as the \\"Polish wing\\" or \\"Pu≈Çawski wing\\". The P.11 served as Poland's primary fighter defence throughout the 1930s, including during the Polish campaign of 1939 by neighbouring Nazi Germany. However, as a consequence of the rapid advances in aircraft design during the late 1930s (seen in such fighters as the Messerschmitt Bf 109), it was outclassed by its rivals at the onset of the war. The majority of the Polish Air Force's P.11s were destroyed during 1939; however, it is believed that as many as 36 were flown to Romania and were subsequently taken over by the Romanian Air Force. The P.11 was a considerable export success. During October 1933, deliveries of Polish-built P.11bs to Romania commenced. From 1936, Romanian aircraft manufacturer Industria AeronauticƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ (IAR) constructed a further 95 aircraft under the designation of IAR P.11f, powered by the Romanian-built IAR 9Krse engine. A dedicated export model of the P.11, which was designated as the PZL P.24, was developed during the late 1930s. Reportedly, Greece, Portugal, Yugoslavia, Turkey and Republican Spain were at one point interested in procuring the P.11; these eventually resulted in several nations, including Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey purchased the P.24 instead. Development =Origins= The history of the PZL P.11 started in 1929, when Polish aeronautical engineer Zygmunt Pu≈Çawski commenced work on designing an all-metal, metal-covered monoplane fighter aircraft. Prior to this, Polish aviation activity had been concentrated on the licensed production of foreign-designed aircraft, particularly French; additionally, these typically had wooden structures, thus Pu≈Çawski's all-metal approach represented a considerable step-change for Polish industry.Liss 1970, p. 3. According to aviation author Wiltold Liss, the initial design produced by Pu≈Çawski, designated as the P.1, possessed multiple of the hallmarks present on contemporary French aviation designs of the era; these similarities can be attributed to Pu≈Çawski himself, who had received a considerable portion of his technical education in France only a few years prior. Simultaneously, the P.1 also bore a number of original innovations, including its characteristic monoplane wing design. While the majority of the world's forces were still using biplanes, the P.1 used a high- mounted and aerodynamically clean gull wing, which provided the pilot with a superior field of view. During September 1929, the first prototype conducted its maiden flight.Liss 1970, p. 4. The aircraft demonstrated its outstanding performance amongst its peers, including the British Bristol Bulldog and the French Dewoitine D.27, when it achieved first place at an international air competition held in Bucharest, Romania. The design generated interest around the world; attention was such that the general layout became commonly known as the \\"Polish wing\\" or \\"Pu≈Çawski wing\\". This wing consisted of a two-spar duralumin structure, complete with rivetted ribs to both the spars and skin; the exterior of the wing was covered by finely corrugated duralumin sheet, while the slotted ailerons had a fabric covering.Liss 1970, pp. 3-4. The Polish War Ministry objected to the aircraft's use of the licence-built Hispano-Suiza V engine, citing insufficient practicality and poor economic grounds. Accordingly, a second prototype, which was designated as the P.6, was completed the next year. This revision featured several deviations from Pu≈Çawski's original vision, including the adoption of a radial engine to power the type in place of the original in-line counterpart; during testing, the P.6's engine was plagued by overheating issues. =Refinement and production= Following the disappointing performance of the P.6, a further improved design, designated as the PZL P.7, was developed. According to Liss, this revision represented the most significant of the P.11's forerunners. The P.7 was placed into series production, having been ordered for the Polish Air Force, who ultimately opted to procure 150 of the type. After designing the P.7, Pu≈Çawski started further variants with larger engines, eventually cumulating in the P.11. During August 1931, the first P.11/I prototype conducted its maiden flight, powered by the British Bristol Jupiter radial engine; the first flight had occurred shortly after Pu≈Çawski's death in an air crash. It was followed by a pair of refined prototypes, the P.11/II and the P.11/III, which used the Bristol Mercury engine instead. They were later joined by several more pre-production aircraft to test out various configurations of engines, propellers, and other features; these test examples led to the P.11/VI, a production-representative version of the design.Liss 1970, pp. 4-5. The first variant of the P.11 to be ordered by the Polish Air Force was the P.11a. From the onset, this was considered to be only an interim model of the type; accordingly, a series of 50 such fighters were constructed.Morga≈Ça 1997, p.60-61 Otherwise similar to the P.7, the P.11a mounted the 575 hp (429 kW) Bristol Mercury IV S2 radial engine, which was produced in Poland under licence. Upon the completion of the P.11a order, PZL immediately set about establishing the production of an improved model of the aircraft, which was designated as the P.11c. The P.11c would be the principal (and final) variant of the type to be inducted into the Polish Air Force. First reaching fighter squadrons during late 1935, it featured the adoption of a new, refined fuselage, a major change of which being the relocation of the engine to be 13 cm lower down in the aircraft's nose, which had the advantage of providing the pilot with an improved exterior view. Besides, a new stronger engine Mercury V S2 had smaller diameter. Forward framework was longer, covering an enlarged and more comfortable cockpit, with pilot's seat moved 30 cm rearwards and raised by 5 cm. The central part of the wings was also modified. During 1934, production of the P.11c commenced, by 1936, the type was being produced at a rate of 25 fighters per month; in total, 150 aircraft were produced by the end of production in 1936 (older sources quoted a number of 175, which is not confirmed in any documents). The first series of approximately 50 P.11c aircraft were fitted with Mercury V S2 of 600 hp (447 kW), the rest with Mercury VI S2 of 630 hp (470 kW). Apart from Poland, Romania showed interest in the new design. Even before the P.11a entered service with the Polish Air Force, 50 aircraft, designated as the P.11b, were ordered for the Romanian Air Force, while an agreement for licence production was agreed.Liss 1970, p. 5. Deliveries of Polish-built P.11bs to Romania commenced in July 1934.Mazur 2013, p.13-14 They were fitted with Gnome-Rhone 9Krsd Mistral engines, otherwise they were similar to the P.11a.Green and Swanborough 1985, p. 43. 49 were finally made, the 50th aircraft being P.11f prototype. After the P.11c had been developed, the Romanians decided to switch the licence production to the new model. As a result, from 1936 IAR built 95 aircraft as the IAR P.11f, powered by the Romanian-built IAR 9Krse engine, which was a licensed version of the Gnome-Rhone 9Krse giving .Morga≈Ça 1997, p. 63, 69 The Romanians then produced another Polish fighter, the PZL P.24, developed from the P.11 exclusively for export. Greece, Portugal, Yugoslavia, Turkey and Republican Spain were interested in buying the P.11, but finally Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey bought the P.24 instead. =Further development and successors= During 1934, the year in which the P.11 entered operational service, it was a contemporary of the British Gloster Gauntlet and German Heinkel He 51 and was arguably the most advanced fighter then in service in the world.Winchester 2004, p. 219. However, due to a series of rapid advances and technological development in the field of aviation, the P.11 was considered to have been rendered obsolete by 1939. It had been overtaken in terms of performance by a new generation of fighter aircraft that commonly benefitted from features such as cantilever wings and retractable landing gear; such fighters included the British Supermarine Spitfire and German Messerschmitt Bf 109.Symanowski and Hoffmann 2006, p. 1. Together with the older P.7, both remained the only Polish fighters in service, however, with about 185 P.11s available, distributed within six air regiments and the aviation school in Deblin. Being aware that the P.11 was now outdated, the Polish Air Force had pinned their hopes on the in-development PZL.50 JastrzƒÖb, which suffered from several delays. When it became apparent that the PZL.50 would not be in widespread service in time for a major conflict that was clearly looming, consideration was given to producing an updated version of the P.11; this was to have been powered by the 840 hp (626 kW) Mercury VIII and have been furnished with an enclosed cockpit, known as the P.11g Kobuz (hobby). Only the prototype of the P.11g with a maximum speed increase to a still-slow 390 km/h (~240 mph) was flown before the war, in August 1939.Liss 1970, p. 6. In light of the unavailability of PZL.50, the only hope of replacing the obsolete P.11 lay in acquiring modern fighters from abroad. In 1939, after receiving the necessary credits, Poland ordered from France 120 Morane-Saulnier M.S.406s, and from Britain, 14 Hawker Hurricane Is (the P.11's chosen replacement), plus a single Supermarine Spitfire I for testing, in addition to 100 Fairey Battle light bombers.\\"Polish Air Force.\\" century-of- flight.net, 2003. Retrieved: 7 July 2011. However, none of these aircraft were delivered to Poland before September 1939. Design The PZL P.11 was an innovative fighter aircraft of the early 1930s, possessing high-mounted gull wings, as well as an all-metal, metal-covered structure. It also possessed several relatively conventional features for the era, such as its use of a fixed undercarriage arrangement. In terms of armament, the P.11 was equipped with a pair of 7.92 mm machine guns mounted upon the sides of the fuselage; reportedly, around a third of all P.11c-model fighters were provisioned with two additional machine guns fixed onto the wings. The fuselage-mounted guns were synchronised, but all others were not; a gun camera could also be installed. In terms of bombs, the P.11c could carry up to four small 12.5 kg bombs, while the earlier P.11a model was not provisioned to carry any.Liss 1970, pp. 6-7. The P.11 was powered by a number of different radial engines, these included the Bristol Mercury IV S2 (normal: , maximum: 575 hp) of the P.11a, the Gnome-Rhone 9Krsd (550 hp, max: 595 hp) of the P.11b, the Bristol Mercury V S2 (565 hp, max: 600 hp) or alternatively the Mercury VI S2 (590 hp, max: 630 hp) of the P.11c: and finally the Gnome-Rhone 9Krse (560 hp, max: 610 hp) of the P.11f, the ultimate version of the aircraft. Regardless of the engine used, the unit would be mounted upon rubber vibration absorbers inside a forward-mounted engine bay and was used to drive a wooden two-bladed fixed- pitch propeller manufactured by Polish company Szomanski. The P.11 had an open cockpit, provisioned with a windshield composed of Plexiglas. Instrumentation included a suite of navigation and engine control gauges, while many of these components originated within Poland, one notable exception was the German- built compass. The safety equipment included an arrangement of several flame dampers, a flare gun, and oxygen tanks for the pilot. Only a few P.11s were furnished with radio sets, leading to pilots being typically reliant upon hand signals and pre-arranged manoeuvres to communicate with one another.Liss 1970, p. 7. The all-metal fuselage of the P.11 was matched to a twin-spar shoulder- mounted wing (which was also all-metal) via bearers set upon the upper portion of the first and second fuselage frames. The wing and the tail employed similar construction techniques, making use of Daude-type rivets, a corrugated duralumin sheet exterior and solid duralumin struts and plates for strengthening. The undercarriage comprised V-shape streamlined struts, furnished with Avia-type oleo pneumatic shock absorbers (including the tail skid) and were braced with steel wire. The P.11 featured an internal fuel tank positioned inside the fuselage that could be jettisoned in case of fire or other emergency. A high-profile flaw was present in the construction of early- built examples in the form of its fuel tanks. Originally manufactured by an independent sub-contractor, the tanks were rivetted and covered with a resin sealing agent; however, this technique would result in joints that would rapidly degrade in the presence of vibration. An initial effort to switch to welded joints was catastrophic, having been determined to have been responsible for failures early on in the P.11's service life. Following a decision by some customers to refuse acceptance of completed aircraft using this type of joint due to these failures, extensive testing to evaluate alternative techniques was conducted by PZL, resulting in the problem being entirely eliminated.Liss 1970, pp. 5-6. Operational history PZL P.11a aircraft At the outbreak of the Second World War, on 1 September 1939, the Polish Air Force had 109 PZL P.11cs, 20 P.11as and 30 P.7as in combat units. A further 43 P.11c aircraft were in reserve or undergoing repairs. Only a third of P.11c were armed with four machine guns, the rest had only two, and even fewer had a radio. The P.11 were used in twelve escadrilles (eskadra), each with ten aircraft (two escadrilles constituted a squadron, in Polish: dywizjon). Two squadrons‚Äîfour escadrilles‚Äîwere in the Pursuit Brigade deployed around Warsaw, with the rest assigned to various armies.Liss 1970, pp. 9-10. All of them took part in the 1939 defense of Poland. Apart from combat units, several P.11 aircraft, including a prototype P.11g, were used in improvised units at air bases. By 1 September 1939, the fighter squadrons had been deployed to remote improvised airfields and were therefore protected from German air attack on the ground. The P.11 would be up against more modern German bombers and fighters‚Äînot only were the German Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Bf 110 faster and better armed, but most German bombers were also faster. Since the P.11 fighters had seen years of intensive use before the war, their maximum speed was even lower than the theoretical 375 km/h. The P.11a's were in even worse condition. In addition, their small total number meant that missions of groups larger than twenty aircraft were rarely undertaken, and reserve machines were almost non-existent. On the other hand, the Polish fighter aircraft featured better maneuverability than their German counterparts and, as a benefit of their design, much better vision from the cockpit. The P.11 also had a durable construction and a good rate of climb, and could take off from short airfields, even of the rough and improvised variety. It could also dive at up to 600 km/h without risk of the wings breaking off. Theoretically the only limit in maneuvers was the pilot's ability to sustain high g forces. Despite the German superiority, the P.11 managed to shoot down a considerable number of German aircraft, including fighters, but suffered heavy losses as well. The exact numbers are not fully verified. A total of 285 German aircraft were lost according to Luftwaffe records, with at least 110 victories credited to the P.11 for the loss of about 100 of their own.Hooton 2007 (Vol. 2), p. 43. Some of the German aircraft shot down were later recovered and put back into service. This allowed German propaganda to claim smaller combat losses. At dawn on 1 September, Capt. Mieczys≈Çaw Medwecki flying a PZL P.11c was shot down by Rottenf√ºhrer (Foreman Leader) Leutnant Frank Neubert of I./StG 2 (Stuka), having the dubious honour of becoming the first aircraft shot down in the Second World War. The first Allied air victory, the shooting down of a Junkers Ju 87, was achieved 20 minutes later by Medwecki's wingman, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gny≈õ, who went on to shoot down a pair of Dornier Do 17s with his P.11c.Liss 1970, p. 10. The P.11c was also the first aircraft to successfully ram an enemy aircraft in the Second World War. The first large air battle of the war took place in the early morning of 1 September over the village of Nieporƒôt just north of Warsaw, when a German bomber group of about seventy Heinkel He 111 and Dornier Do 17 was intercepted by some twenty P.11 and ten P.7 fighters, and had to abandon their mission to Warsaw. The following day, nine PZL P-11s of No. 142 Squadron, led by Major Lesnievski, intercepted two formations of Dornier Do 17 on river Vistula. Jackson 1979, p. 27. Attacking head on, the Polish pilots managed to shoot down seven twin-engined bombers, two of them credited to Lieutenant Stanis≈Çaw Skalski (future Distinguished Flying Cross & Two Bars) for no losses to themselves. Jackson 1979, pp. 28-29. Most of the P.11s were destroyed in 1939, though thirty-six were flown to Romania and taken over by the Romanian Air Force. Due to their obsolescence, these veteran aircraft were not used in combat; only a small number were used for training while the rest were dismantled for spare parts. It has been alleged that some aircraft were captured and saw limited use by the Germans.Liss 1970, p. 8. A pair of P.11s were captured by the Red Army and used for testing. One landed in Hungary (near the town of Hajd√∫b√∂sz√∂rm√©ny) and was used as a glider tow plane by the University of Technology in Budapest.

It is a Main Operating Base of the RAF and home to the Typhoon Force Headquarters and three front-line Eurofighter Typhoon FGR4 units, No. 3 Squadron, No. 11 Squadron and No. 12 Squadron. In support of front-line units, No. 29 Squadron is the Typhoon Operational Conversion Unit and No. 41 Squadron is the Typhoon Operational Evaluation Unit. Coningsby is also the home of the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF) which operates a variety of historic RAF aircraft. History =Second World War= Plans for an airfield at Coningsby began in 1937 as part of the RAF's expansion plan. However progress in the compulsory purchase of the land was slow and delayed the start of work for two years. The station opened on 4 November 1940 under No. 5 Group, part of RAF Bomber Command.Halpenny, Bruce Barrymore Action Stations: Wartime Military Airfields of Lincolnshire and the East Midlands v. 2, page 64 The first flying unit, No. 106 Squadron with the Handley Page Hampden medium bomber, arrived in February 1941, with active operations taking place the following month when four Hampdens bombed Cologne in Germany. The squadron was joined in April 1941 by No. 97 Squadron equipped with Avro Manchester medium bombers. In May 1942, aircraft from Coningsby participated in the 'Thousand Bomber' raid on Cologne. The original grass runways were found to be unsuitable for heavy bomber operations so the station was closed for nearly a year between September 1942 and August 1943, whilst paved runways were laid in preparation for accommodating such aircraft. At the same time further hangars were constructed. Avro Lancaster B.IIIs of No. 619 Squadron, airborne from RAF Coningsby whilst based there during 1944. The first unit to return was the now-famous No. 617 'Dambusters' Squadron. Equipped with Avro Lancaster heavy bombers, the squadron was stationed at Coningsby from August 1943. Due to its specialist nature, the Dambusters carried out limited operations whilst at Coningsby, with the most notable being Operation Garlic, a failed raid targeting the Dortmund-Ems canal in Germany, when five out of the eight Lancasters on the mission failed to return home. As the squadron required more space, it moved to nearby RAF Woodhall Spa in January 1944, swapping places with another Lancaster unit, No. 619 Squadron, which itself later moved on to RAF Dunholme Lodge.Halpenny, Bruce Barrymore Action Stations: Wartime Military Airfields of Lincolnshire and the East Midlands v. 2. Page ? Further Lancaster squadrons were based at Coningsby during the final months of the war, including No. 61 Squadron from RAF Skellingthorpe, No. 83 Squadron and No. 97 Squadron. =Post war= Following the Second World War, Coningsby was home to the Mosquito-equipped No. 109 Squadron and No. 139 Squadron, then became part of No. 3 Group, with Boeing Washington aircraft from 1950. On 17 August 1953 52-year-old Air Vice-Marshal William Brook, the Air Officer Commanding of No. 3 Group, took off from the base in a Gloster Meteor, and crashed into a Dutch barn at Bradley, Staffordshire. =Jet aircraft= The airfield received its first jet aircraft‚Äîthe English Electric Canberra‚Äîin 1953.Halpenny, Bruce Barrymore Action Stations: Wartime Military Airfields of Lincolnshire and the East Midlands v. 2. Page 67. During 1956, the station expanded with the runway being extended. Avro Vulcans arrived in 1962, then transferred to RAF Cottesmore in November 1964. From 1964 to 1966, the station had been initially designated to receive the proposed RAF strike aircraft, the advanced BAC TSR-2, which was cancelled for purported economic reasons in April 1965 by the Labour Government. The TSR2 was planned to join No. 40 Squadron at Coningsby in 1968 to replace the Canberra. =Phantoms= The TSR2's intended replacement‚Äîthe American General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark‚Äîwas shelved on 16 January 1968 when its costs overshot the UK's budget (it would have cost ¬£425m for 50 aircraft). The TSR2 had large development costs, whereas the F-111 (also known as Tactical Fighter Experimental, or TFX) could be bought off the shelf. Coningsby was planned to get the General Dynamics F-111K, the RAF version of the F-111; also in the 1966 Defence White Paper, it was intended that the Anglo-French AFVG, later the UKVG, would replace the TSR2 (it did eventually as the Tornado). 50 F-111Ks were planned with 100 AFVGs (to enter service by 1970); Denis Healey claimed the F-111s and AFVGs would be cheaper than the TSR2 programme (158 aircraft) by ¬£700m. As Minister of Aviation throughout 1965, the Labour MP Roy Jenkins had also wanted to similarly cancel the Olympus-powered Concorde, but the 1962 Anglo-French treaty imposed prohibitively steep financial penalties for cancellation; the Hawker Siddeley P.1154 and HS.681 were cancelled at the same time.Wood 1975, p. 224. AFVGs were also planned to replace the Buccaneer in the Royal Navy‚ÄîTornados were never flown by the Royal Navy, as the carriers for them, the CVA-01s, were cancelled. But the Royal Navy did operate fourteen Phantoms on Ark Royal, until the new smaller carriers entered service‚Äî48 Phantoms had been designated for the Fleet Air Arm, with twenty of these ending up at Leuchars, and Ark Royal's Phantoms ended up at Leuchars in 1978. Eagle was never converted to Phantom use as it was deemed too expensive, and the carrier was scrapped in January 1972, with its Sea Vixen aircraft. Another alternative considered by the Labour government in July 1965 for the TSR-2 was to order Spey-engined French Mirage IV aircraft, to be known as the Mirage IVS; it would have avionics from the TSR-2, and be partly made by BAC at Warton. Phantom from No. 43 Squadron in September 1980; 6 Squadron was the first to get operational Phantoms in May 1969 at Coningsby; 54 Squadron received the aircraft in September 1969; both squadrons were disbanded in 1974 Spey-engined Phantoms (the plane the government eventually bought, having been ordered in February 1964 for the Fleet Air Arm, instead of the P.1154) were chosen in 1966 for the station's future as with the scrapping of aircraft carriers the Phantoms were not needed for the Fleet Air Arm, with all RAF Phantom training taking place on the airfield, and the station became part of Fighter Command until December 1967, when it joined Air Support Command as the Phantoms were initially in a ground attack role. Phantoms first saw operational service with the Fleet Air Arm in 1970. The first Phantom FGR2 (Fighter/Ground attack/Reconnaissance) arrived at Coningsby on 23 August 1968, with the first aircrew OCU course (228 OCU) beginning in October 1968. Air-defence Phantoms (FG1) also entered service in 1969 at RAF Leuchars. On 18 May 1970, a Phantom flew from the base non-stop to RAF Tengah in Singapore, covering in 14 hours and 14 minutes at an average speed of . In April 1968, Strike Command was formed and the airfield was transferred to 38 Group.Darling, p. 91 41 Squadron joined in April 1972, and stayed until 1977. The other ground-attack Phantom squadrons (four of them) were at RAF Bruggen. 111 Squadron replaced their Lightnings (from Wattisham) with Phantoms from 1 October 1974. On 1 January 1975, 29 Squadron joined and stayed until 1987, when disbanded. On 1 November 1975, 23 Squadron joined until February 1976, when moved to Wattisham. In March 1976, 56 Squadron joined until July 1976, then went to Wattisham. The Phantom's role changed to air defence in October 1974 when the airfield transferred to 11 Group in RAF Strike Command, when the SEPECAT Jaguar (situated in Norfolk) took over the ground attack role. 111 Squadron were the first to take the new air defence Phantoms. During 1975, the UK's air defence transferred to the Phantom FGR.2 from five squadrons of Lightnings. The UK was covered by NATO Early Warning Area 12. Three Sector Operations Centres were at Buchan, Boulmer and Neatishead; in the 1960s, the UK had the Linesman/Mediator radar system, which was obsolete by the 1970s. No 29 Squadron formed with Phantoms at Coningsby on 1 January 1975; until then the Phantom FG.1 had been operating with the Royal Navy only. On 3 March 1975 a Phantom crashed into a nearby house, with both pilot and navigator ejecting. The Queen visited the station on 30 June 1976. =Tornados= Panavia Tornado F3 ZE785 of No. 41 Squadron in July 2007. Panavia Tornado F3 squadrons began to form from November 1984, namely No. 229 OCU/No. 65 Squadron.Halpenny, Bruce Barrymore Action Stations: Wartime Military Airfields of Lincolnshire and the East Midlands v. 2. Page 221. Tornado training took place until April 1987, when the Phantoms left (to RAF Leuchars) and Coningsby had the first (No. 29 Squadron) Tornado air defence squadron.Halpenny, Bruce Barrymore Action Stations: Wartime Military Airfields of Lincolnshire and the East Midlands v. 2. Page 222. To accommodate these new aircraft, extensive hardened aircraft shelters (HAS) and support facilities were built. No. 5 Squadron arrived in January 1988, having previously operated the English Electric Lightning. During the Gulf War, Tornados from Coningsby were based for three months at Dhahran International Airport. Tornado engines were serviced on the northern section of the former RAF Woodhall Spa, denoted as RAF Woodhall. =Eurofighter Typhoon= A Eurofighter Typhoon from No. 3 Squadron takes off in 2008.Coningsby was the first airfield to receive the Phantoms, the Tornado ADV and was the first to receive its replacement, the Eurofighter Typhoon. Typhoon arrived in May 2005 with No. 17 Squadron, after the RAF first publicly displayed the aircraft at Coningsby in December 2004. No. 3 Squadron moved to RAF Coningsby where it became the first operational front line RAF Typhoon squadron in July 2007 and No. 11 Squadron became operational at RAF Coningsby shortly thereafter.RAF Coningsby squadrons retrieved 29 December 2008 No.12 Squadron reactivated in July 2018 and is temporarily integrating Qatari Emri Air Force air and ground crews in order to provide training and support as part of the Qatari purchase of twenty-four Typhoons from the UK. In October 2019, RAF Coningsby signed a twinning agreement with Fighter Wing 73 () of the German Air Force () to enhance opportunities to meet and train with one another. The wing, based at Laage in north-eastern Germany, also operates the Eurofighter Typhoon.  Role and operations  RAF Coningsby's mission statement is 'To develop the future, deliver the present and commemorate the past of the Royal Air Force's combat air power.' The station is home to nearly 3,000 military personnel, civil servants, and contractors. BAE Systems Military Air Solutions, who produce the Typhoon, are also stationed on the airfield with the contract to maintain the aircraft. = Command = The station commander is Group Captain Mark Flewin. The station's Honorary Air Commandant is Prince William, Duke of Cambridge. The station is under the command of No. 1 Group (Air Combat). = Typhoon operations = A No. 11 Squadron Eurofighter Typhoon outside a hardened aircraft shelter at Coningsby. The Eurofighter Typhoon FGR4 provides the RAF with a multi-role combat capability for air policing, peace support and high intensity conflict. RAF Coningsby is the home to three front-line Typhoon units, No. 3(F) Squadron and No. 11 Squadron as well as No. 12 Squadron which is a joint RAF/Qatari Emri Air Force squadron. They are accompanied by No. 29 Squadron which is the Typhoon Operational Conversion Unit which trains new crews.  Quick Reaction Alert  Since June 2007 Coningsby's Typhoons have been responsible for maintaining the Quick Reaction Alert (Interceptor) South mission (QRA(I)S). Aircraft and crews are held at a high state of readiness, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to respond to unidentified aircraft approaching UK airspace. QRA missions range from civilian airliners which have stopped responding to air traffic control, to intercepting Russian aircraft such as the Tupolev Tu-95 Bear and Tu-160 Blackjack.  Test and Evaluation  The fourth Typhoon unit is No. 41 (Test and Evaluation) Squadron which is part of the Air Warfare Centre. The squadron develops operational tactics and evaluates new avionics and weapons systems. Formerly the Fast Jet and Weapons Operational Evaluation Unit (FJWOEU), it is a merger of the Strike Attack OEU (previously based at MOD Boscombe Down), the Tornado F3 OEU (previously based at RAF Waddington) and the Air-Guided Weapons OEU (previously based at RAF Valley). =Battle of Britain Memorial Flight= Spitfire Mk IX MK356 inside the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight hangar.alt=Spitfire Mk IX MK356 inside the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight hangar at RAF Coningsby.left Coningsby has been home of the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF) and the associated visitor centre since March 1976 when it arrived from RAF Coltishall.Battle of Britain Memorial Flight Visitor Centre The BBMF operate one of two remaining airworthy Avro Lancaster bombers in the world, alongside; six Spitfires of various types; two Hurricanes; a Dakota and two Chipmunks, the latter type being used for pilot training. = Force Protection = No. 7 Force Protection Wing Headquarters provides operational planning, command and control to two RAF Regiment field squadrons attached to the wing, No. 63 (Queen's Colour) Squadron (based at RAF Northolt) and No. 2623 (East Anglian) Squadron (RAuxAF) (based at RAF Honington) whose purpose is to protect RAF bases at home and abroad from ground attack. Part of No. 5 RAF Police Squadron, under the command of No. 8 RAF Force Protection Wing at RAF Waddington, is also based at the station and provides policing, security and guarding.  Air Land Integration (ALI) Cell  No. 7 Force Protection Wing includes the Air Land Integration (ALI) Cell, which provides a forward air control capability. The ALI Cell trains and provides Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTACS) and Tactical Air Controller Parties (TACPS) to support RAF and joint operations. The ALI Cell moved to Coningsby from RAF Honington in Suffolk and came under the control off the wing in June 2018. =Expeditionary Air Wing= No. 121 Expeditionary Air Wing was formed at Coningsby on 1 April 2006 to create a deployable air force structure.Cotter 2008, p. 33.

She was their first daughter to die and third child to die before them. Early life Princess Amelia in 1785 Princess Amelia was born on 7 August 1783, at the Royal Lodge, Windsor, the youngest of George III and Queen Charlotte's 15 children as well as the only one born at Windsor Castle. It is often said that she was her father's favourite; he affectionately called her \\"Emily\\". She was born after the early deaths of her two elder brothers, Octavius (23 February 1779 - 3 May 1783) and Alfred (22 September 1780 - 20 August 1782). These deaths left a gap of almost six years between Amelia and her nearest surviving sibling, Princess Sophia. She was twenty-one years younger than her eldest sibling, George, and nearly seventeen years younger than her eldest sister, Charlotte. Amelia was christened at the Chapel Royal, St James's Palace by John Moore, Archbishop of Canterbury, on 17 September 1783. Her godparents were the Prince of Wales (Amelia's eldest brother), the Princess Royal (her eldest sister), and the Princess Augusta Sophia (her second eldest sister). She was the fifteenth sibling christened there. She was later confirmed by the Archbishop on 24 December 1799. Coming so soon after the death of Octavius and shortly before the end of the war between Great Britain and the United States, Amelia's birth was felt to be a beginning of a new period of hope, and much was expected of her, even from birth. \\"Our littlest sister is without exception one of the prettiest children I have ever seen,\\" her oldest sister wrote to Prince William when Amelia was only a month old. She was expected to be as beautiful, charming, and winning as Octavius, her father's previous favourite child, had been. As a result of her two brothers' deaths, Amelia was considered as her father's favourite. From an early age, Amelia was conscious of her rank. A popular tale relates that when the famous tragedian Sarah Siddons expressed a desire to kiss the beautiful baby, Amelia \\"...instantly held her little hand out to be kissed, so early had she learnt the lessons of Royalty.\\" When Amelia was three, Fanny Burney, the Queen's Keeper of the Robes, commented that the princess could be \\"decorous and dignified when called upon to act en princess to any strangers, as if conscious of her high rank, and the importance of condescendingly sustaining it.\\" Burney even dubbed her \\"the little idol\\". As the youngest of the thirteen surviving children, Amelia spent most of her time with her sisters Mary and Sophia, living in various royal residences. From the beginning, the three younger princesses did not receive as much parental attention as their elder sisters had, and spent a good deal of time away from the King and Queen, communicating with them mostly by letter. It seems that the three youngest princesses were much wilder than their elder sisters, as evidenced by their behaviour when they sat for a portrait in 1785. In 1770, Johan Zoffany had been able to paint the King, the Queen, and all six eldest children with little difficulty. In 1785, however, John Singleton Copley had so much difficulty getting the dogs, birds, and especially the three royal children to sit still that he never painted another portrait. Compared to the carefully planned education that Charlotte, Augusta, and Elizabeth had been given, the education given to Mary, Sophia, and Amelia was based solely on what had come before. Amelia was only five years old when her father suffered his first bout of madness. As a consequence of her father's declining health, she never experienced the closeness and affection that had characterized the family during her elder sisters' early years.Princesses, Flora Fraser The Three Youngest Princesses, by John Singleton Copley, 1785 (Amelia is the baby) Adulthood Prior to 1788, King George had told his daughters that he would take them to Hanover and find them suitable husbands despite misgivings he had, which stemmed from his sisters' own unhappy marriages. He remarked, \\"I cannot deny that I have never wished to see any of them marry: I am happy in their company, and do not in the least want a separation.\\" However, the King suffered his first bout of madness that year, when Amelia was aged five. Further lapses into insanity occurred in 1801 and 1804, thus forestalling talk of marriage for his daughters. The question of matrimony was rarely raised; Queen Charlotte feared that the subject, which had always discomfited the King, would push him back into insanity. Furthermore, the Queen, under strain due to her illness, wanted the princesses to remain close to her. Amelia and her sisters, Charlotte, Augusta Sophia, Elizabeth, Mary and Sophia were over-protected and isolated, which restricted meeting eligible suitors of their own age. =Illness= In 1798, Princess Amelia developed a pain in the joint of her knee and was sent to the large seaside town of Worthing for recovery. She wrote to her father, \\"Certainly the vapour and warm sea bath are of use and therefore I hope that I shall be able to assure you that I am better.\\" The following year, Amelia temporarily recovered enough to join her family at Weymouth, where she doted upon her niece Princess Charlotte of Wales. Throughout her life, Amelia was often in poor health; at the age of fifteen, she started to suffer the early symptoms of what turned out to be tuberculosis. In 1801, the princess was sent for a seaside cure at Weymouth to improve her health. Among those staying with her was the Hon. Charles FitzRoy, an equerry 21 years older than she, and the son of Charles FitzRoy, 1st Baron Southampton. Amelia fell in love with the equerry, desiring to marry him. The Queen was told of the affair by a servant but turned a blind eye. It was hoped that such discretion would prevent the King from discovering the liaison, which may have risked sending him into one of the bouts of mental illness to which he was becoming increasingly prone. Though she never gave up hope of marrying him, Amelia knew she could not legally marry FitzRoy due to the provisions of the Royal Marriages Act passed by her father's Parliament (at least until she reached the age of 25, after which she could receive permission by the assent of the Privy Council). She would later tell her brother Frederick that she considered herself to be married, taking the initials A. F. R. (Amelia FitzRoy). In 1808, Amelia had a severe attack of measles and the depressing atmosphere at home with her mother in Windsor made her even more miserable. The anxious King George decided to send Amelia to Weymouth, accompanied by her sister Mary. Her health was improved only a little, but she found comfort in quietly resting. In 1809, she could occasionally take short walks in the garden. This improvement was temporary, and in August 1810 her sufferings grew sharper, while in October of that year she was seized with St. Anthony's fire (erysipelas), which cut off all hope and confined her to her bed on the 25th. The king summoned his daughter's physicians to him at seven o'clock every morning and three or four other times during the day, questioning them minutely as to her condition. She lingered a few days more, waited upon to the last by her favourite and devoted sister, Mary. Her death occurred on the same day as her brother Edward's birthday, 2 November. The dying princess had a mourning ring made for the King, composed of a lock of her hair under crystal set round with diamonds. He purportedly burst into tears upon receiving it. Otherwise, her will dictated all her possessions be given to Charles FitzRoy. Amelia was buried in the royal vault in St George's Chapel, Windsor. Her eldest brother, later George IV, is reputed to have requested her death mask. Death and aftermath After Amelia's death, George Villiers, the King's bailiff, and younger brother of Thomas Villiers, 2nd Earl of Clarendon, attempted to blackmail the King and Queen with letters belonging to Amelia, after the disappearance of ¬£280,000 in his control. Villiers was father of later diplomat and statesman George Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon. Her death is credited with contributing to the decline in her father's health which resulted in his insanity and the subsequent invocation of the Regency Act of 1811. According to his doctor Dr. Willis, the king would later cry \\"in a wild, monotonous, delirious way, 'Oh Emily [Princess Amelia], why won't you save your father? I hate all the physicians...\\" Another of King George's delusions included the belief that a healthy Amelia was only staying in Hanover with a large family of her own, where she would \\"never grow older and always be well.\\" Amelia has been described as a beautiful, slender girl with ruby lips and auburn hair. Reportedly she was the \\"most turbulent and tempestuous of all the Princesses\\". However, she is also said to have been amiable, spirited, unselfish and intelligent. These qualities led her sister-in-law Princess Caroline, who was known to despise her in-laws, to call Amelia the \\"most amiable of the bunch\\". Amelia was a favourite of both the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Sussex, who called her a \\"lovely creature\\". Amelia adored the former and once told him that she had always loved him better than her other brothers. He for his part loved her perhaps more than he did his other sisters (with the possible exception of Princess Mary) and was devastated when she died. So deeply affected was he by her death that after her funeral, he could never again sleep in a room that was not lit by several wax candles. He also burst into tears at the mention of her name more than three years after her demise.

Usually, a bluejacker will only send a text message, but with modern phones it's possible to send images or sounds as well.

He scored 11 tries in his 16 games on tour. He was the only English back in the 1973 Barbarians side that beat the All Blacks 23‚Äì11 at Cardiff Arms Park. In the first half he made a run that has become part of rugby lore, that brought gasps and cheers from a Welsh crowd more accustomed to regarding him with hostility. When he broke through the All Black defence, he appeared to confuse the commentator, Cliff Morgan, who did not know whether Duckham had sidestepped or dummied. He even sent the cameraman the wrong way; his change of direction was such that the camera went to the right and Duckham disappeared out of shot to the left. After the match he was given the nickname 'Dai' by the Welsh fans because he played like one of their own. Arguably his best performances in later years were overseas or for Coventry. He made his last appearance against Scotland at Murrayfield in 1976. For his club, Coventry, he played 12 seasons from 1967 to 1979.

The band was very successful in Canada, with eleven of their albums being certified Gold in the country, including four being certified Platinum and two achieving multi- platinum certifications. Between 1996 and 2016, Great Big Sea was the sixteenth best-selling Canadian artist in Canada and the sixth best-selling Canadian band in Canada. While it has been confirmed that the band has officially retired, former members Alan Doyle and S√©an McCann have continued performing in their own solo careers typically including music from Great Big Sea in their setlists. History =Beginnings= The band played its first official gig on March 11, 1993, opening for the Irish Descendants at Memorial University of Newfoundland in St. John's, Newfoundland. The founding band members included Alan Doyle (vocals, guitar, bouzouki, mandolin), S√©an McCann (vocals, bodhr√°n, guitar, tin whistle), Darrell Power (vocals, bass, guitar, bones), and Bob Hallett (vocals, fiddle, accordion, mandolin, concertina, bouzouki, whistles, bagpipes) Power, McCann and Hallett had already been playing together in another band. In the winter of 1989, the band, a six-piece with guitar, bass, fiddle, accordion and mandolin played its first gig, two songs, at the Memorial University's winter carnival talent show under the name \\"Newfoundland Republican Army\\" or NRA, and won first prize. The band's only other appearance as NRA was later that winter at the university \\"Grad House\\". The band then dropped the fiddler, accordion player and the name. The band found its new name as original bassist Jeff Scott rented an apartment on Rankin Street, St. John's, where the members first met and discussed the formation of the band. As a four-piece, the band first appeared as \\"Rankin Street\\" at a little pub in downtown St. John's called \\"The Rose and Thistle\\", playing for $100 and beer. For the first gig the band played through Sean McCann's stereo system; this worked well for the band, as renting a PA would have cost more than the night's earnings. Susan Hickey (guitar and vocals) left the band months later to attend school in Halifax and was replaced by Darrell Power. The band gained much popularity playing such local pubs as Bridget's and Greensleeves. In 1991 Jeff Scott was replaced by Jackie St. Croix on bass. The band released one recording on cassette titled \\"Rankin Street\\". According to Doyle, Rankin Street owned a PA system and he owned a van, which made Great Big Sea \\"a match made in heaven.\\" Retrieved November 26, 2006 They toured nearly constantly for the band's first several years, sometimes traveling as many as 300 days a year. In 1997, the band reached the top ten of the Canadian RPM pop chart with \\"When I'm Up (I Can't Get Down)\\", a cover of a song by the British folk group Oysterband.

In the 2000 Canadian Federal Election, controversy occurred when Stockwell Day and the Canadian Alliance used the band's hit single, \\"Ordinary Day\\", at a rally without their permission. The band noted that this was a copyright violation and ordered that Day cease using the song for campaigning purposes. Great Big Sea's first concert DVD and videos collection, the Great Big DVD, saw release in Canada and the United States in 2003 and Europe in 2004. In late 2005, the band released its long-awaited \\"traditional\\" album, The Hard and the Easy, on which they recorded their favourite Newfoundland party songs. The title of the album comes from a line of the song \\"Tickle Cove Pond\\", one of two songs on the album about a horse falling through ice. Also in late 2005, Great Big Sea released its first podcast, with clips of the band bantering back and forth in the studio mixed with various songs by them and other artists. They have since released several podcasts. On February 9, 2006, the band's tour bus tipped on its side into a ditch on the Trans-Canada Highway about 80 kilometres east of Vancouver near Surrey. The bus went on its side (right side) right beside the commercial weigh scales. As traffic backed up as far as Chilliwack, British Columbia, RCMP started to re-route traffic through the weigh scales.

Alan's \\"From the Road\\" blog on the band's website, originally confirmed its production in an April posting, speaking also of the album's subsequent release in July. \\"Nothing But A Song\\" is the first single off the bands' ninth studio recording, with a subsequent tour kicking off at the end of the summer 2010. The Canadian television series Republic of Doyle uses Great Big Sea's \\"Oh Yeah\\" as its theme song. Great Big Sea appeared on \\"It's Friday\\", a song by Dean Brody on his 2012 album Dirt. Great Big Sea announced a 'greatest hits' album titled \\"XX\\" in October 2012, accompanied by a 20th anniversary tour with 32 dates in 28 cities across the US and Canada which kicked off on March 5, 2013 in Los Angeles and finished in St. John's on April 23, 2013. =McCann's departure= In 2013, McCann announced that he would be leaving the band at the end of the XX tour, much to the dismay of his bandmates.\\" After Great Big Sea, S√©an McCann becomes a musician-entrepreneur\\". Josh O‚ÄôKane, The Globe and Mail, Oct. 27, 2016 In an interview with Bob Mersereau for the CBC, S√©an discussed his life changes. \\"I stopped drinking two and a half years ago, I've decided to leave the band I've been in for 20 years. I'm 46 years old, and I've decided to make ...changes.\\" =Retirement= On November 5, 2015, Alan Doyle was quoted in an interview with Christopher Tessmer of the Regina Leader-Post, \\"We‚Äôre all struggling to define what the status of Great Big Sea is right now. As most people know, at the end of 2013 ‚Äî after our 20th Anniversary tour ‚Äî Sean (McCann) quit and left the band. We spent a length of time ‚Äî a year or so ‚Äî to find an amicable way that Bob (Hallett) and I could continue without him. We couldn‚Äôt, so we came to the realization that we didn‚Äôt want to go on like that. We don‚Äôt want to fight for the spoils of it. For the lack of a better term, the band is now happily retired.\\" On February 27, 2017, Alan Doyle was quoted in an interview with Jason Setnyk of the Cornwall Seeker, \\"Of course (we‚Äôre still friends). Sean, Bob, Darrell, and myself still own the publishing. Sean doesn‚Äôt live in Newfoundland anymore. We don‚Äôt talk as much as we once did, but he seems to be doing really well and great, and good luck to him.\\" =Charity work= Great Big Sea is a member of the Canadian charity Artists Against Racism and worked with them on a radio PSA.

His works were translated into more than 20 countries, and the total number of his books that were published abroad rises up to 60 books. He has also been known for his painting, and he opened many art exhibits in Romania and abroad. He occupied the position of Minister of Culture within the Nicolae VƒÉcƒÉroiu Cabinet, without being a member of any political party, after the Romanian revolution of 1989 (from 25 November 1993 to 5 May 1995).  Biography  Born to a family of farmworkers in Bulze»ôti, Dolj County, Sorescu graduated from the primary school in his home village. After that he went to the Buzesti Brothers High School in Craiova, after which he was transferred to the Predeal Military School. His final education was at the University of Ia≈üi, where, in 1960, he graduated with a degree in modern languages. His first book, a collection of parodies in 1964 entitled Singur printre poe≈£i (\\"Alone Among Poets\\"), was widely discussed. He himself called them \\"sarcastic and awkward\\". Ten volumes of poetry and prose followed, having a very rapid ascension in the world of literary, as a poet, novelist, playwright, essayist. He grew so popular that his readings were held in football stadiums. In 1971, he was a resident of the International Writing Program at the University of Iowa. On his poetry, Sorescu said, with characteristic irony: \\"Just as I can't give up smoking because I don't smoke, I can't give up writing because I have no talent.\\" He often claimed a sense of alienation, saying \\"the spoken word is a crossed frontier. By the act of saying something, I fail to say many other things.\\" On censorship, he said, after his last, post-1989 Revolution volumes were delayed, \\"we have won our freedom, so I mustn't complain. O censors, where are you now?\\" Sorescu's collection of Censored Poems comprised poems could not be published until the end of the Nicolae Ceau≈üescu Communist dictatorship; of these, the best known is House under surveillance. Iona, the play written by Marin Sorescu and first published in 1968 is a true masterpiece. The biblical myth says the prophet Iona was swallowed by a whale.http://paginiortodoxe.tripod.com/vssep/09-22-sf_prooroc_iona.html In his play, Sorescu takes the story further and imagines what happens to Iona while he was inside the whale. \\"The most terrible part of the play is when Iona loses his echo\\", writes Sorescu in the foreword of this play. \\"Iona was alone, but his echo was whole. He shouted: Io-na, and his echo answered: Io-na. Then, it remained just half of the echo. He shouted Io-na, but all he could hear was Io. Io, in some ancient language, means me\\".http://ctt.ro/wp- content/uploads/2012/11/Marin-Sorescu-Iona.pdf Iona was played to a full house in Bucharest in 1969, but the tragedy was quickly withdrawn, because its content was considered too controversial.http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/marin-sorescu Ill with cirrhosis and hepatitis, he died from a heart attack at the Elias Hospital in Bucharest, aged 60.

He was instrumental in developing Hizb ut-Tahrir in the United Kingdom before leaving the group and heading to another Islamist organisation, Al-Muhajiroun, until its disbandment in 2004. For several years, Bakri was one of the most infamous, high-profile Islamists based in London, and was frequently quoted and interviewed in the UK media. In December 2004 he vowed that Muslims would give the West \\"a 9/11, day after day after day\\", if Western governments did not change their policies. He has been described as \\"closely linked to al-Qaeda\\"‚Äîhaving released prepared statements from Osama bin Laden after the 1998 United States embassy bombings‚Äîbut also as the \\"Tottenham Ayatollah\\", \\"little more than a loudmouth\\", and \\"a figure of fun\\". In 2005, following the 7 July 2005 London bombings, The Sunday Times reported that \\"a dozen members\\" of his group Al-Muhajiroun \\"have taken part in suicide bombings or have become close to Al-Qaeda and its support network\\". Shortly after, Bakri left the UK, where he had sheltered for 20 years, for Lebanon. While there, he was informed by the Home Office that he would not be allowed back into the UK. Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said on 12 November 2010 that Bakri was among 54 people sentenced by a military court to life in prison with hard labour after being accused of acts of terrorism. After the decision, Bakri told reporters, he would \\"not spend one day in prison\\", and said, \\"I will not hand myself in to any court. I do not believe in the law in Britain as in Lebanon.\\" On 14 November 2010, he was arrested by the Lebanese police and was transferred to Beirut. Biography =Early life and education= Bakri was born into a wealthy family in the city of Aleppo, Syria.According to Jon Ronson, Bakri claimed that his family had \\"chauffeurs and servants and palaces in Syria, Turkey and Beirut\\". From the age of five, he was enrolled in the al-Kutaab Islamic boarding schools (a primary school, known as a madrassa, that teaches children how to recite and keep Quran by heart) where he studied the Qur'anic Sciences, Hadith (the sayings of the Prophet of Islam and his Companions), Fiqh (Islamic Jurisprudence), and Seerah (The detailed biography of the Prophet of Islam), etc. Bakri joined the Syrian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood as a young man. He did not participate in their 1982 Hama revolt against the Syrian Ba'ath Party and the government of Hafez al-Assad. In 1979, Bakri left Lebanon and moved to Cairo, Egypt, where he studied at Al-Azhar University for six months. He left Al-Azhar before he could get a degree due to disagreements with his teachers. Throughout his life, Bakri said that he joined many Islamic movements including Muslim Students, Ebad ul-Rahman, al-Ikhwan (al-Tali'ah section), and Hizb ut Tahrir. According to an interview with \\"Jamestown Special Correspondent\\" Mahan Abedin, Omar Bakri joined Hizb-ut-Tahrir (HT) in Beirut and maintained contacts with it in Cairo, and started an HT cell in Saudi Arabia. Bakri said that he studied at the university of Umm al-Qura in Mecca and the Islamic University of Madinah.Omar Bakri, Essential Fiqh. London: The Islamic Book Company, 1996. p. 3 In 1984, the Saudi Arabian government arrested Bakri in Jeddah, but released him on bail. =In United Kingdom= Bakri moved to the United Kingdom on 14 January 1986. Later, he traveled to the United States to study English; he returned to the United Kingdom to assume the leadership of Hizb ut-Tahrir and become their spiritual leader. He defended the Muslim faith in public debates against Christian apologists, such as Jay Smith.\\"There Can Be No End to Jihad\\", Interview by Anthony McRoy with Islamist Sheikh Omar Bakri Muhammad, Christianity Today, February 1, 2005 In the UK, Bakri worked for ten years helping to build up Hizb ut-Tahrir. According to ex-Hizb ut-Tahrir associate Maajid Nawaz, Bakri encouraged its members to engage in vigilantism against non-Muslims and Muslim women: \\"We were encouraged by Omar Bakri to operate like street gangs and we did, prowling London, fighting Indian Sikhs in the west and African Christians in the east. We intimidated Muslim women until they wore the hijab and we thought we were invincible.\\"\\"I was a radical Islamist who hated all of you\\", news.com.au; accessed 25 October 2015. In 1996, Bakri split with Hizb ut-Tahrir over disagreements on policy, style and methods. He declared that Al-Muhajiroun was an independent organisation and continued as its Amir until 2003. After the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, Bakri praised the attackers as \\"magnificent.\\" He began to support the theology and philosophy of Al Qaeda. Bakri said that he had become a Salafi Muslim. Media outlets and British Muslims criticised him for his open support for various international jihadist organisations. On 13 September 2001, Bakri told the Daily Mail, \\"When I first heard about [the September 11, 2001 attacks], there was some initial delight about such an attack. I received a phone call and said, 'Oh, wow, the United States has come under attack.' It was exciting.\\" According to The Times, Bakri was left alone by British law prior to July 2005 despite actions such as an issuing a fatwa \\"containing a death threat against President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan\\" because: > Bakri, who acts as [al-Muhajiroun's] spiritual leader, insisted that his > followers obey a \\"covenant of security\\" which, while encouraging terror > abroad, forbade them from carrying out attacks in Britain. But \\"the authorities may have been lulled into a false sense of security\\", because the covenant was not permanent. In November 2004 Bakri disbanded Al- Muhajiroun, saying that \\"all Muslims should unite together against a hostile West\\". Three months later Bakri said this \\"covenant of security\\" was no longer in force, having been violated by the British government. \\"Experts note\\", according to The Times, that the July London bombings followed \\"four months later\\". The same article reports \\"The Sunday Times has identified more than a dozen members of ALM who have taken part in suicide bombings or have become close to Al-Qaeda and its support network\\", including Mohammed Naeem Noor Khan, \\"a computer expert now in a Pakistani prison\\"; Zeeshan Siddiqui, from Hounslow, west London; Bilal Mohammed from Birmingham; and Asif Hanif. Bakri received an estimated ¬£250,000 in state benefits since claiming asylum in Britain in 1986. Since he left the country in 2005, he has been banned from entering Britain. He is 144792.stmtitle=Cleric Bakri Barred from Britainpublisher=BBC Newsdate=12 August 2005access-date=28 December 2009}} Students His main students were Khalid Kelly, Anjem Choudary, Sulayman Keeler, Abu Izzadeen, and Abu Uzair, a trained civil engineer who leads or led the Savior Sect. =Return to the Middle East= On 6 August 2005, Bakri left the United Kingdom following stories that the UK Government were planning to investigate certain Muslim clerics under little-used treason laws. He was banned from returning by British Home Secretary Charles Clarke stating that Bakri's presence in Britain was \\"not conducive to the public good\\". He subsequently took up residence in Lebanon. During the 2006 Lebanon War, he tried to flee Lebanon on a Royal Navy vessel evacuating British citizens. He was turned away by the Royal Navy however. In 2005, Bakri made a televised appeal to the captors of Norman Kember, a hostage in Iraq. After his speech Bakri said, \\"I appeal myself to them, you see, that to show guidance and mercy to any victim in their hand. But after that I can't myself guarantee anything except to tell you these people mean business.\\" Bakri has reaffirmed the fatwa on Salman Rushdie, saying from Lebanon, \\"Rushdie will continue living his life in hiding. Any fatwa will stand until it is fulfilled. He is always going to be worried about a Muslim reaching him.\\" During an online question-and-answer session, a Vigil member asked Bakri if Dublin Airport should be a terrorist target because U.S. troops transit there on the way to Iraq. Bakri told the member to \\"hit the target and hit it very hard. That issue should be understood. Your situation there is quite difficult, therefore the answer lies in your question.\\" He said the 7/7 London bombers were in \\"paradise\\". On 27 July 2007, a special edition of Newsnight entitled 'Battle for Islam' was broadcast, in which Gavin Esler presented on the battle for the heart and soul of Islam. Omar Bakri featured live from Lebanon alongside Reza Aslan in Los Angeles, and Benazir Bhutto in the studio in London with Maryam Namazie. Currently Bakri reportedly heads the Atibaa' Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah movement. =Family= Bakri is, or was, married to Hanah and has seven children. According to ex-Hizb ut-Tahrir member Maajid Nawaz, Bakhri's daughter, Yasmin Fostok, \\"grew so disillusioned with her father's rhetoric that in one monumental act of defiance she left home and became a stripper\\".Maajid Nawaz, Radical (London: W.H. Allen, 2012), p. 328. On 30 December, his son, Bilal, was reported to have been killed while fighting for ISIS in Iraq. Alleged ties to terrorism British newspapers have called him the \\"Tottenham Ayatollah\\", despite him identifying as Salafi and the title \\"ayatollah\\" being a Shia epithet. Former Conservative MP Rupert Allason described him as a \\"terrorist who believes in planting bombs and blowing up women and children in Israel\\". Roland Jacquard, a French expert on Islamic terrorism, said that \\"every al-Qaeda operative recently arrested or identified in Europe had come into contact with Bakri at some time or other\\".Bakri profile, cnn.com; accessed 25 October 2015. =Internet broadcasts= In January 2005, The Times monitored live, 90-minute internet lectures from Bakri in a chatroom in which he told listeners, \\"I believe the whole of Britain has become Dar al-Harb (land of war). The kuffar (non-believer) has no sanctity for their own life or property.\\" He said Muslims should join the jihad \\"wherever you are\\" and told a woman she was allowed to do a suicide bombing. In another broadcast he said, \\"Al-Qaeda and all its branches and organizations of the world, that is the victorious group and they have the emir and you are obliged to join. There is no need ... to mess about.\\" Two days later, in another broadcast, he said that dead mujaheedin \\"are calling you and shouting to you from far distant places: al jihad, al jihad. They say to you my dear Muslim brothers, 'Where is your weapon, where is your weapon?' Come on to the jihad.\\" Andrew Dismore, a Labour MP, claimed that \\"With these words he may well be committing offences under the Terrorism Act and other legislation. I will be raising this immediately with the Home Secretary and the Metropolitan Police.\\" Comments on terrorist attacks Commenting on 11 September 2001 attacks, The Times claims he said on his website, \\"I am very happy today. As much as I regret the innocent people who passed away, with the USA you must pay.\\" The Montreal Gazette however claims that he said in an interview, \\"If Islamists did it‚Äîand most likely it is Islamists, because of the nature of what happened‚Äîthen they have fully misunderstood the teachings of Islam. ... Even the most radical of us have condemned this. I am always considered to be a radical in the Islamic world and even I condemn it.\\" Bakri, discussing the 2004 Madrid train bombings, is alleged by The Times to have said, \\"What happened in Madrid is all revenge. Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, life for life.\\" =Financing of \\"mujahideen\\"= On 24 October 2006 British security officials arrested Omar Bakri's son, Abdul Rahman Fostok, at Heathrow Airport, and seized ¬£13,000 that he intended to deliver to Bakri in Lebanon. The money was held under the Proceeds of Crime Act, pending an investigation, but Fostok was allowed to board his flight. Responding to this, Bakri said, =Kidnapping plot= On 31 January 2007 British police arrested nine suspected terrorists who were allegedly planning to kidnap, torture, and behead a British Muslim in the army, all of which would be videotaped and later broadcast on the internet. The soldier had served in the War in Afghanistan, but had returned home to Britain on temporary leave. On 4 February secret recordings of Bakri Muhammad emerged in which he calls for the attack. Bakri told listeners, He previously called for a kidnapping-terrorist attack in 2005. In another incident he said he hoped someone would \\"capture British Muslims who are in the Army over there\\". He has said that a Beslan-style attack is alright if children are not deliberately killed. =Them: Adventures With Extremists= British journalist Jon Ronson's Them: Adventures With Extremists, a documentary (The Tottenham Ayatollah, directed by Saul Dibb) and book published in 2001, depicts Ronson and Dibb's interactions with Bakri. Ronson depicts Bakri as a charismatic orator who tells a cheering crowd of 5000 that \\"he will not rest\\" until he sees \\"the Black Flag of Islam flying over Downing Street\\", and calls for the stoning of fornicators and closing of pubs. He tells Ronson, \\"I cannot take a day off, an hour off, even a minute off. I will take time off when I am with Allah, when I die in the battlefield and become a martyr.\\" But he also describes Bakri as living in a semi-detached council house, enjoying watching a video of Disney's The Lion King, being unable to hold a fish caught on a fishing line, and calling himself \\"actually very nice\\". In a phone call after the 9/11 attack on the evening of his arrest and release without charge, Ronson reports Bakri as telling him, Ronson replied that he had never thought that. =Arrests and conviction in Lebanon= Future Television interviewed Bakri on 11 August 2005. Bakri said he did not have ties to Al Qaeda, calling it a \\"media creation\\" and said he did not intend to return to Britain. During the interview, Bakri said, \\"I left Britain on my own accord though I have not been accused of anything there or in Lebanon ... but the London attacks are the reason I have returned\\". According to media reports, Lebanese police arrested Bakri as soon as he left the building after the interview. Police later said the arrest was \\"a routine arrest to determine his reasons and if his residency in Lebanon is legitimate\\". Lebanese Information Minister Ghazi Aridi later said Bakri was arrested as a \\"precautionary measure\\". British Ambassador to Lebanon James Watt said, \\"We made no request for his arrest, nor for his extradition. As far as I am concerned, this is a very simple story ‚Äì it is a Lebanese citizen who returned to Lebanon and has been arrested by the Lebanese police. We have nothing to do with it and it's not in our place to comment on what has happened.\\" In mid-November 2010, Bakri was sentenced to life in prison in Lebanon in a terrorism case that he claimed to know nothing about, but was subsequently released on bail when witnesses who testified against him withdrew their testimony. After his release he was reported to be living in Tripoli. In April 2014, his home was raided by Lebanese security forces because of his alleged involvement in fighting between the area's Alawite community and local Sunnis. He fled the city and the Lebanese authorities announced he was wanted for \\"endangering national security\\". In May 2014 he was arrested in the city of Aley and, in a press conference, the Lebanese Interior Minister, Nouhad Machnouk, alleged that Bakri \\"has contributed in every aspect in supporting terrorism\\". In October 2014, Bakri was sentenced to six years in prison with hard labour by a Lebanese court for founding a Lebanese affiliate of the Al-Qaeda linked Syrian terrorist group Al-Nusra Front, and of building a training camp for Nusra Front fighters in Lebanon. The following year, two of Bakri's sons were killed fighting in the ranks of rival extremist group the Islamic State. The first, Muhammad, was killed in Aleppo, Syria, and the second, Bilal, in Salah al-Din province in Iraq in December 2015.Rai al Youm (29 December 2015), \\"Son of Extremist Islamist Umar Bakri Killed in Iraq While Fighting as Member of Islamic State\\" (ŸÖŸÇÿ™ŸÑ ŸÜÿ¨ŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿßÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÖŸä ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ™ÿ∑ÿ±ŸÅ ÿπŸÖÿ± ÿ®ŸÉÿ±Ÿä ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿßŸÇ ÿÆŸÑÿßŸÑ ŸÖÿ¥ÿßÿ±ŸÉÿ™Ÿá ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑŸÇÿ™ÿßŸÑ ÿ∂ŸÖŸÜ ÿ™ŸÜÿ∏ŸäŸÖ ÿßŸÑÿØŸàŸÑÿ© ÿßŸÑÿßÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÖŸäÿ©), Raialyoum Publications The author of \\"many booklets and articles\\",David Zeidan, The Resurgence of Religion: A Comparative Study of Selected Themes in Christian and Islamic Fundamentalist Discourse, BRILL (2003), p. 294 some of his publications include: *Essential Fiqh, London : Islamic Book Company, 1996. *The role of the mosque, London : Islamic Book Company, 1996. *The political struggle for Islam, London : Al-Khilafah Publications, 1998. *Al-Fareed Fee Mukhtasar Al-Tawheed: A Summary of the Unique Tawheed, London : Al-Muhajiroun Publications, 2003.

The play presents a cluster of complex and unresolved problems for scholars of English Renaissance theatre. Date Locrine was entered into the Stationers' Register on 20 July 1594 and published in 1595 in a quarto issued by printer Thomas Creede. Individual scholars have proposed dates for the play from the early 1580s on; many have favored a date c. 1591, based on the play's links with other works of the era. It has been argued, for example, that Locrine borrows from the Complaints of Edmund Spenser, published in 1591,Chambers, Vol. 4, p. 27. and from The Complaint of Elstred, a poem by Thomas Lodge, written c. 1591, that circulated in manuscript before its first printing in 1593. The question of the play's date is complicated by the question of its authorship; if Charles Tilney was the play's author (see below), it must date prior to Tilney's death in 1586.Logan and Smith, pp. 258‚Äì259, 263‚Äì264. Authorship The title page of the 1595 quarto advertised the play as \\"Newly set foorth, overseene and corrected, / By W. S.\\" An identification of \\"W. S.\\" with William Shakespeare apparently led to the play's inclusion among the seven works that Philip Chetwinde added to the second impression of his Shakespeare Third Folio in 1664 ‚Äì which in turn led to the inclusion of Locrine in the Shakespeare Apocrypha. The play's stiff, formal verse is un- Shakespearean ‚Äì but the extant text of Locrine does show evidence of revision.Maxwell, pp. 39‚Äì63. Some commentators have accepted the possibility that Shakespeare might have performed a revision ‚Äì while others have rejected the idea. The authorship of the original play has been assigned to several dramatists of the era, with George Peele and Robert Greene being the two most common candidates.Logan and Smith, pp. 259‚Äì263. A manuscript note found in a copy of the 1595 quarto, and apparently by Sir George Buck, who was Master of the Revels under King James I from 1609‚Äì22, states that his cousin, Charles Tilney, was the author: :::Char. Tilney wrot[e a] :::Tragedy of this mattr [which] :::hee named Estrild: [which] :::I think is this. it was [lost?] :::by his death. & now s[ome] :::fellon[possibly fellou] hath published [it.] :::I made du[m]be shewes for it. :::w[hi]ch I yet haue. G. B. (The note is trimmed along its right edge, obscuring some words.)Halliday, p. 283.Maxwell, pp. 205‚Äì207. Samuel A. Tannenbaum disputed the authenticity of the note, claiming it was a forgery, probably by John Payne Collier, but it has been demonstrated that the handwriting is genuine.Eccles, pp. 438-9. If Charles Tilney wrote the play, it must date before his 1586 execution for participation in the Babington Plot. There is no evidence, however, that Charles Tilney did any dramatic writing, other than his alleged connection with Locrine. Sources and influences For the subject of his play, the author of Locrine drew upon a legendary pseudo-history of the founding of Britain. Just as Virgil, in the Aeneid, credited the founding of Ancient Rome to exiles from a defeated Troy, so later English writers such as William Caxton and Raphael Holinshed, adapting the medieval pseudo-history of the Welsh-Norman author Geoffrey of Monmouth, credited another band of Trojan exiles for the foundation of a British realm. It was this fanciful origin myth, applied to the English rather than the Brythons, that provided the foundation for Locrine (Locrinus in Geoffrey's Historia Regum Britanniae). The author also drew material from the Mirror for Magistrates.Maxwell, p. 27. The revenge tragedies of Seneca were a major influence on Locrine. In addition to the poetry of Spenser and Lodge noted above, critics have pointed to links with the contemporary dramas of Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Kyd, Robert Greene and George Peele. Links with contemporary plays and playwrights can be, and have been, variously interpreted as evidence of influence or evidence of common authorship.Logan and Smith, pp. 263‚Äì264.Maxwell, pp. 64‚Äì71. Locrine and Selimus Locrine shares a complex inter-relationship with another anonymous play of its era, Selimus, first published in 1594. The commonalities between the two plays involve parallels of plot elements and shared verbal expression and prosodic structure.Maxwell, pp. 52‚Äì63. The majority of scholars who have considered the problem judge the author of Selimus to have borrowed from Locrine ‚Äì though a minority has favored the opposite conclusion.Logan and Smith, pp. 265‚Äì266, 306‚Äì309. The common features in the two plays have led some critics to suppose that they are the work of the same author; but since both plays are anonymous and their authorship is disputed, the connection between the two dramas obscures as much as it enlightens. Synopsis Following the Senecan model of revenge tragedy, each of the play's five acts is preceded by a Prologue that features At√´, the ancient Greek goddess of folly and ruin. In each, Ate introduces and explicates a dumbshow; the play's five dumbshows feature symbolic figures and animals, or personages of classical mythology. In the first, an archer kills a lion; the second shows Perseus and Andromeda, and the third, a snake stinging a crocodile. The fourth dumbshow features Hercules and Omphale; the final dumbshow depicts Medea's murder of Jason and Glauce. Ate returns for a sixth and final appearance at the play's conclusion. The opening scene of the play proper shows the aged Brutus, the leader of the Trojans in Britain, before his courtiers, including his three sons, Locrine, Camber, and Albanact. Brutus knows he is dying, and attempts to order the kingdom's affairs; among other points, he decrees that Locrine marry Guendoline, the daughter of his loyal general Corineus. The scene ends with Brutus's death. Locrine obeys his father's behest and marries Guendoline. Meanwhile, the invading Scythians arrive for their (totally unhistorical) incursion into the British Isles, led by their king Humber, with his wife Estrild and their son Hubba. Subsequent scenes depict a back-and-forth combat between Trojans and Scythians. When his apparent victory turns to sudden defeat, the Trojan prince Albanact commits suicide; Albanact's ghost appears through the remainder of the play, calling for revenge. The Trojans are eventually victorious. Estrild, the Scythian queen, is captured and brought to the Trojan court, where Locrine quickly falls in love with her. Corineus warns his royal son-in-law to remain faithful to Guendoline. Locrine does not follow this advice, though he sequesters Estrild in a subterranean hideaway for seven years. Once Corineus dies, Locrine brings his affair into the open; Guendoline's brother Thrasimachus vows revenge. The defeated Humber has been living in seclusion and grinding privation for seven years since his defeat; when he kills himself, the ghost of Albanact exults. Corineus's ghost also appears to witness Locrine's fate; defeated in battle by the forces of Guendoline and Thrasimachus, Locrine and Estrild commit suicide, and their daughter Sabren eventually drowns herself. Guendoline has her husband buried royally, next to his father, but consigns Estrild to an obscure grave. The play's comic relief is provided by a coterie of clown characters, Strumbo, Trompart, and Dorothy. Strumbo the cobbler marries Dorothy, but is impressed into the army along with his servant Trompart, to fight the Scythians. Strumbo survives battle by counterfeiting death: :Trompart: Yet one word, good master. :Strumbo: I will not speak, for I am dead, I tell thee. Later Strumbo has an encounter with Humber, just before the latter's suicide. Strumbo is prepared to feed the starving Humber, but is frightened away by Albanact's ghost.

She began her career working in a recording studio, where she met Nigel Stonier Career Gilmore was born in Oxford to Irish parents and lived in the village of North Aston, Oxfordshire. She became interested in music as a result of her father's record collection, which included work by Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, and The Beatles. Later, she listened to Elvis Costello, Tom Waits, and The Replacements, among others. Having always written poetry and stories, she began seriously writing songs at the age of 15. Gilmore released her first album as a teenager, entitled Burning Dorothy, in 1998 and over the course of the next four years, released increasingly well-received albums that earned her a reputation in the UK music press but no chart success. In 2002 Gilmore shared lead vocals with Kellie While, beside musicians Maartin Allcock; John Kirkpatrick, Robbie McIntosh, Michael McGoldrick and Simon Swarbrick in the Reel and Soul Association. The project mixed American soul and British Folk music. The group's eponymously titled album gained considerable mainstream attention which resulted in numerous TV appearances and radio broadcasts including the BBC's Top of the Pops 2. Gilmore finally made a breakthrough at 23 with the release of Avalanche in August 2003, which became her first album to break into the Official UK Album Chart, at No. 62, and spawned two minor hit singles, \\"Juliet (Keep That in Mind)\\" and \\"Mainstream\\", for which she garnered acclaim for producing a low-budget music video filmed in a local Virgin Megastore. The video received exposure on the BBC's flagship music show Top of the Pops 2. In 2004, folk singer Joan Baez personally invited Gilmore to open for her during her tour leading up to the US presidential election. In 2005, Gilmore continued touring commitments, for the first time not releasing a new album (the covers collection Loft Music was widely released during 2004). Gilmore finally returned to recording with the release of Harpo's Ghost in August 2006, after a two-and-a-half-year absence of new material. This was her first album on major label Sanctuary Records after many years of independent releases. The album was once again acclaimed in the music press and UK radio lent their support to the single \\"Cheap Tricks\\". On 14 November 2006, Gilmore gave birth to her first child, a son named Egan, having conducted a UK tour in the autumn whilst heavily pregnant. Subsequent to the release of Harpo's Ghost she parted company with her manager, left Sanctuary Records and released EP The Threads independently on her March 2007 UK tour with remaining copies sold on her website afterwards. On 19 May 2008 Fruitcake Records (via Fullfill and distributed by Universal Records) released Liejacker, Gilmore's eighth album featuring contributions from Joan Baez, Dave McCabe, and Erin McKeown. It was preceded on 12 May by the single \\"Old Soul\\", a duet with McCabe. In June 2008, Gilmore signed to Rykodisc (Warner) for the United States. Liejacker was released in the US on 23 September 2008. Thea's first live album, Recorded Delivery, was released on 25 May 2009, on Fullfill/Universal. The recordings are taken from UK shows during 2006 and 2008, with the first half of the album being acoustic, and the second half being electric, with a full band. In July 2009 she released a yearly subscription service / fan club, Angels in the Abattoir. Gilmore rounded out 2009 with the release of an album of Christmas- and winter-themed songs, Strange Communion, featuring eight originals penned by Gilmore and/or Stonier as well as two cover versions ‚Äì Yoko Ono's \\"Listen, the Snow is Falling\\" and Elvis Costello's \\"The St. Stephen's Day Murders.\\" Beginning in October 2010, Gilmore and her band were engaged in a UK tour and had good reviews. In January 2011, Gilmore appeared at Glasgow Royal Concert Hall in a tribute concert celebrating the 70th Birthday of Bob Dylan. She performed versions of \\"I Pity the Poor Immigrant\\" and \\"Masters of War.\\" Subsequently, Gilmore entered the studio with producer and husband Stonier and recorded the entire set of tracks found on Dylan's original release of John Wesley Harding. The album ‚Äì also titled John Wesley Harding ‚Äì was released 23 May 2011. 2011 saw the release of a collaboration with the late Sandy Denny entitled Don't Stop Singing and, in 2012, the CD single \\"London\\" was released from the album (and featured on the BBC coverage of the London 2012 Olympics montage of team GB medal winners). The single was also released as an exclusive Record Store Day 7‚Ä≥ single on 21 April. In July 2011, Gilmore gave birth to a second son, Asher.Thea Gilmore: Making music helped me get over postnatal depression, Metro, 14 May 2013 In 2013 Gilmore released a new album of original material Regardless to critical acclaim and much exposure on BBC Radio 2.

The river's name derives from the Ojibwe Mishipikwadina, meaning \\"big bluffs,\\" and refers to the large hills located near the river's mouth. From the outlet of Dog Lake, the Michipicoten River flows south through a series of large lakes: Manitowik and Whitefish. Then it flows mostly west to Lake Superior. There are four hydroelectric generating stations on this last section of the river (operated by Brookfield Power Inc.).

Funded by the New Zealand Government, the station commenced broadcasting on 28 March 2004 from its studios in Newmarket, Auckland. It has since moved to East Tamaki, Auckland. History MƒÅori Television was launched on 28 March 2004 and attracted a cumulative audience of 300,000 in its first month on air (April 2004). The main channel attracts 1.5 million viewers each month; half of all MƒÅori aged five or more, and one- third of all New Zealanders. Te Reo, the station's second channel, was launched on 28 March 2008. It stands out from the main channel in that it is both free of advertising, and broadcast completely in MƒÅori (without subtitles). Te Reo features special tribal programming with a particular focus on new programming for the fluent members of its audience. Operations The station is under the stewardship of two stakeholders which are the New Zealand Government, and the MƒÅori Television Electoral College (Te Putahi Paoho). It has an annual budget of $45m, almost one-third of state spending on television in New Zealand. In July 2015, the MƒÅori Television board decided that Hamilton or Rotorua could be a new home for the broadcaster.

It reads \\"This second Maydens tragedy (for it hath no name inscribed) may with the reformations now be acted publikely.\\" The Second Maiden's Tragedy is a Jacobean play that survives only in manuscript. It was written in 1611, and performed in the same year by the King's Men. The manuscript was acquired, but never printed, by the publisher Humphrey Moseley after the closure of the theatres in 1642. In 1807, the manuscript was acquired by the British Museum. Victorian poet and critic, Algernon Swinburne, was the first to attribute this work to Thomas Middleton; this judgement has since been joined by most editors and scholars.Briggs, Julia. ‚ÄúThe Lady‚Äôs Tragedy: Parallel Texts‚Äù. Middleton, Thomas. Thomas Middleton: The Collected Works. Oxford University Press. (2007) p. 833. The play has received few modern revivals. It was the opening production at the newly refurbished Hackney Empire studio in 2006 starring Alexander Fiske- Harrison and Jos Vantyler.http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/ Title The play's original title is unknown. The manuscript bears no title, and the censor, George Buc, added a note beginning \\"This second Maiden's Tragedy (for it hath no name inscribed)...\\". Buc was possibly comparing the play to Beaumont and Fletcher's The Maid's Tragedy. Buc's comment confused a seventeenth-century owner of the manuscript, Humphrey Moseley, who listed the play in the Stationers' Register as The Maid's Tragedy, 2nd Part.Martin Wiggins, ed. Four Jacobean Sex Tragedies (Oxford UP, 1998), p. xxx. Buc's title has stuck and the play is usually referred to as The Second Maiden's Tragedy. However, two recent editors of the play have preferred to retitle it. In his anthology Four Jacobean Sex Tragedies, Martin Wiggins argues that since the word \\"second\\" refers to the play, not to a character (there is no \\"second maiden\\"), Buc was actually calling the play The Maiden's Tragedy.Martin Wiggins, ed. Four Jacobean Sex Tragedies (Oxford UP, 1998), pp. xxx‚Äìxxxi. In Thomas Middleton: The Collected Works, Julia Briggs goes further: pointing out that the word \\"maiden\\" never appears in the play, she retitles it The Lady's Tragedy, after the unnamed female protagonist.Julia Briggs, ed. The Lady's Tragedy: Parallel Texts in Thomas Middleton: The Collected Works Oxford University Press (2007) p. 833. Briggs was anticipated by the 1994 Hen and Chicken production in Bristol, which also used The Lady's Tragedy.Martin Wiggins, ed. Four Jacobean Sex Tragedies (Oxford UP, 1998), p. xl. Other theatrical productions have also retitled the play. For example, in 1984, the first, modern professional production at London's Upstream Theatre called it The Tyrant's Tragedy, after the play's primary protagonist.Thomas Middleton: The Collected Works (Oxford UP, 2007), p. 835. The play has similarly been known in the past as simply The Tyrant, identifying it as being a lost play by Philip Massinger of the same title.Anne Lancashire, ed. The Second Maiden's Tragedy (Manchester University Press, 1978) Authorship The back page of the manuscript, featuring a title and three authorship attributions by its later owners. The names of Thomas Goffe and George Chapman are heavily crossed out, the words \\"by Will Shakespeare\\" less heavily so. =Thomas Middleton= The play's authorship is also contested. On the manuscript, three crossed-out attributions in seventeenth century hands attribute it first to Thomas Goffe, then to William Shakespeare, and then to George Chapman. Today, however, the scholarly consensus is that the true author was Thomas Middleton, as indicated by linguistic analysis, and by its similarity with other Middleton plays.Julia Briggs, The Lady's Tragedy, in Thomas Middleton: The Collected Works (Oxford UP, 2007), 833. It was first published under Middleton's name in Martin Wiggins's anthology Four Jacobean Sex Tragedies (1998), and subsequently in the 2007 Collected Works of Middleton. =Shakespeare and Cardenio= thumbAct II, scene ii, \\"Enter Votarius sadly. VOTARIUS All's gone; there's nothing but the prodigal left: I have played away my soul at one short game Where e'en the winner loses. Pursuing sin, how often did I shun thee! How swift art thou afoot, beyond man's goodness, Which has a lazy pace! So was I catched.\\" Professional handwriting expert Charles Hamilton claimed in a 1994 book that the manuscript of The Second Maiden's Tragedy is in fact the lost Shakespearean play Cardenio and indeed that the handwriting is Shakespeare's.Charles Hamilton, Cardenio, or, The Second Maiden's Tragedy, Lakewood, Colorado: Glenbridge Publishing, Ltd., 1994. Scholars have given little consideration to this idea, agreeing with the Middleton attribution.Jonathan Bate, The Genius of Shakespeare The play does appear to draw on elements of Don Quixote, as Cardenio is assumed to have done. Julia Briggs points out that as \\"Shakespeare's Cardenio\\" the play received greater awareness and acquired new theatrical life, with several productions in the 1990s.Briggs, Julia. ‚ÄúThe Lady‚Äôs Tragedy: Parallel Texts‚Äù. Middleton, Thomas. Thomas Middleton: The Collected Works. Oxford University Press. (2007) p. 835. Although The Second Maiden‚Äôs Tragedy has been generally credited to Middleton, there is evidence that Shakespeare could have contributed to the play. When examining the manuscript, there are slips of paper that were added to the prompt book, which shows revisions or notes. These slips of paper have been examined and it is quite certain that Middleton did not write these revisions, as they do not resemble his handwriting. However, the notes resemble the handwriting assumed to be Shakespeare's. It is also possible that Shakespeare could have written these notes because at the time the play was to be produced, Shakespeare was still in the King's Court, and could have been working on the play and had influence. Therefore, despite the consensus that Shakespeare is not responsible for the writing of The Second Maiden‚Äôs Tragedy, it is quite possible that Shakespeare was involved in its production and revision.  Plot vs. sub-plot  The Second Maiden's Tragedy contains both a plot and a subplot, and they share similar and different characteristics. The plot and subplot are connected to each other only loosely, in that the main plot's protagonist, Govianus, is the brother of Anselmus, one of the primary characters in the subplot. Thematically, however, there are more interesting connections at work. The purpose behind having a plot and a subplot is to have two stories that magnify the ‚Äúfundamental contrasts inherent in the material.‚Äù The inspiration behind the subplot comes from Miguel de Cervantes's Don Quixote. From Cervantes's text, Middleton wrote a similar story and created a different resolution to the subplot. There are similarities and differences between the two. = Similarities = Both stories revolve around the women of the stories and the conflicts they face when it comes to love. Within the plot, the Lady is to be married to Govianus, but the Tyrant constantly pursues her. Within the subplot, the Wife is married to Anselmus, and a man who is not her husband also pursues her. In each plot, both women must choose whether to remain faithful to their husbands, or whether to give in to lust, and this is where the two plots diverge. = Differences = The first difference is that the two women are faced with a test, which leads to two different outcomes. This test is used to understand whether or not both the Lady and the Wife will remain faithful to Govianus and Anselmus. The Lady passes the test and because she does, she is given peace and salvation for her decision. The Wife fails to remain faithful and she faces corrosive conflict; because of her decision, the Wife is constantly in conflict with her own guilty conscience. The plot contains a ‚Äúblameless protagonist whose wholly undeserved catastrophe is caused by the persecution of a villain and is treated as triumphant martyrdom.‚Äù The Lady, after her death, is declared a martyr and is further glorified by those who surround her, especially Govianus. Govianus states, ‚ÄúCome thow delitious treasure of mankinde to him that knowes what vertuous woman is‚Äù as a way of honoring the Lady one final time. He refers to her as a woman of virtue, even though she commits suicide. Her body is ‚Äúplaced on a throne and crowned, before it solemnly bourne back into her tomb.‚Äù The Lady's death is one of honor and a death that benefits other people. Within the subplot, the protagonist is faced with immense feelings of guilt. These feelings result in her ultimate surrender, which is exposed through her choice of suicide. The Wife's death is described as a reckless display of despair, and she is not given the honor that the Lady received. Instead, she ‚Äúhas dragged her husband and her lover down with her to degradation and death.‚Äù The Wife ruins the esteem of both her husband and her lover and leaves a mark on their reputation forever. After her death, Anselmus states, ‚Äú\\"The serpents wisdome is in weemens lust‚Äù because he believes that the devil takes part in all that the Wife goes through in the story. Major themes Throughout The Second Maiden's Tragedy there are many prominent themes. Necrophilia was brought up when the Tyrant wanted to have sex with the dead body of the Lady whom he was trying to preserve, this could be viewed as attachment. The Tyrant was fascinated with the Lady's beauty and after she killed herself to escape his grasp this was the only way he could feel satisfied. She would not grant him access to her body throughout the first act of the play when the Tyrant asked her to marry him. By refusing the requests of his authority she was then placed under house arrest only furthering tensions between the Tyrant and the Lady. The Tyrant also made attempts to take the Lady to bed with him which were unsuccessful. This fascination would lead to his death at the end of the play. The Lady shows great sense of pride in upholding her morals throughout the play. ‚ÄúThe Lady resists temptation [‚Ä¶] the Lady is free from taint [‚Ä¶] and the Lady meets her death with noble conviction.\\" This is holding herself to a high standard which in turn makes her body more desirable by the Tyrant. The Female corpse can be seen as a prominent theme in The Second Maiden's Tragedy because it was the center of attention after the Lady's death. Face Painting could be seen as a sense of life because the Tyrant uses face paint so the corpse of the Lady would seem more alive. This relates back to his original plan of using the body for necrophilia, as he was trying to make the body lifelike again. The female body could be seen as an erotic figure because sexual attractiveness and deadness can become indistinguishable.\\" This scene in the play could have been used to spark voyeuristic interests from the audience. Using the female body as an object of infatuation would allow the Tyrants ambitions to be shown after the climax of the play. There are also underlying influences of face painting, as the strategic use of face painting was popular during the Renaissance. T.W. Craik comments that face painting often is used to signify moral corruption. This is significant because The Second Maiden‚Äôs Tragedy can be viewed as a commentary on the political life. During the time that the play was written, it was believed that the court of James I was ‚Äúvery much in need of moral cleansing‚Äù. Therefore, the presence of face painting in The Second Maiden‚Äôs Tragedy exemplifies the sin and corruption of James I. Furthermore, the poisoned lips which lead to the Tyrant's death is also significant. It was well known that in the Jacobean era, makeup was in fact poisonous. The use of Lady's lips poisoning the Tyrant can be seen to draw attention to sexual corruption.This also relates to the belief that those in power were corrupted during the time of The Second Maiden‚Äôs Tragedy. The female body of the Wife also caused problems within the play and controversially led to the climax of the play. The Wife kills Votarius after he tried seducing her after he fell in love with her unexpectedly. Anselmus was pleased to see her faithfulness so he killed Leonella who accused the Wife of being unfaithful. However, this action causes the Wife's death in a sword fight between Anselmus and Bellarius. Female action sparked men's motives to be brought forth which caused this bloody scene. Loyalty and trust are also important because many relationships throughout the play were questioned just like Anselmus' wife. Votarius‚Äô wife had proven her love for him and Anselmus showed doubts about his wife's. This sent the characters into disarray when Votarius actually fell in love with Anselmus‚Äô wife who had shown her nonexistent loyalty to Anselmus. This loyalty stunt could be seen as ironic to the genre of the play which is a tragedy. This play ‚Äúconcerns characters who are fundamentally blind, who fail to understand the world in which they live, who insist on undoing themselves.\\" However, in this instance the action and feeling of falling in love could not be undone and it turns into disastrous consequences. Chaste within this text is symbolic because the female body is seen as an idol and being unfaithful outside of the marriage would be a big deal. For the male characters in the text such as the Tyrant having sex with multiple people wasn't a problem because he had a lot of power. If a woman did this there could be varying consequences though because of their husbands. Another thing that is interesting is the disconnection between body and spirit. When the Lady died it was clear that her corpse was without spirit since her spirit sought after the rescue of the maternal body from the Tyrant. It can be argued that ‚Äúthe figure of the Lady is divided into three personae that are ultimately irreconcilable.\\" These can be classified as her living body, her desecrated corpse, and her sainted spirit. Each of these played a role in deceiving the Tyrant and making him look like a bad character. Even though the play may demonize the Tyrant as a monster, the presumed forces of virtue ultimately prove complicit in his transgression.\\" These can all be interrelated in The Second Maiden‚Äôs Tragedy as the play had many connecting events and themes.  Major influences  There are many cultural and political components that influenced Second Maiden‚Äôs Tragedy. A ruler who is after a pure, beautiful, woman was a very popular theme and used often during this time = Sophronia = The story of a Christian martyr named Sophronia can be viewed as an influence to the plot line of The Second Maiden's Tragedy. She can be seen as an influence due to her similarity to Lady, who kills herself after the Tyrant orders guards to take her and bring her to him. Sophronia also commits suicide, stabbing herself, when an emperor, Maxentius, sends messengers.This influence is plausible because the story and events of Sophronia's death was well known during the time period that the play was written. = Religious Influences = The death of the character Lady in The Second Maiden's Tragedy can be seen as a parallel to the death and Resurrection of Christ. Similar to the women who visited the tomb of Jesus and could not find his body in the tomb, Govianus goes to visit the tomb of Lady and finds her body gone. An angel tells the women that Jesus is \\"not here\\", and the spirit of Lady tells Govianus \\"I am not here.\\" = Talmudic legend and Herod = There is a specific reference to a Talmudic legend in The Second Maiden‚Äôs Tragedy named Mariamme, which can be seen as a direct influence in the play. It appears in ib. Iii 115‚Äì120,‚ÄúI once read of a Herod, whose affection/pursued a virgin's love, as I did thine, who for the hate she owed him killed himself, as thou too rashly didst, without all pity ‚Äú. The woman, Mariamne commits suicide, throwing herself off a roof, in order to save herself from marrying Herod, who killed everyone else in her family. This is similar to The Second Maiden‚Äôs Tragedy because the Lady kills herself in order to escape the Tyrant, and she has no other family besides her imprisoned father, Helvetius. After her suicide, her body is preserved using honey. This is clearly similar to the death of Lady and her preservation, as ordered by the Tyrant. Once the Tyrant discovers that Lady has killed herself, he is determined to still have her as her wife, and orders an artist to paint her face with makeup so she can appear alive and have sex with the body. The explicit reference shows both the time period in which The Second Maiden‚Äôs Tragedy was written in and also shows how outside cultural knowledge influenced the events and plot of the play  Characters  * The Tyrant, the usurping king * Govianus, the deposed king * Memphonius, Sophonirus, Helvetius, nobles * The Lady, daughter to Helvetius, afterwards her spirit * Votarius, friend to Anselmus * Anselmus, brother to Govianus * The Wife to Anselmus * Leonella, her waiting-woman * Bellarius, lover to Leonella Synopsis The Second Maiden's Tragedy is centered on four main characters: Govianus, the virtuous king of the story, his fianc√©e who is referred to as the Lady, Govianus‚Äô brother Anselmus, and his wife who is referred to as the Wife. ACT ONE * The Tyrant has deposed the rightful king Govianus and declares his intent to marry the Lady, Helvetius's daughter. The Tyrant banishes Govianus. Before Govianus is allowed to depart, however, he's forced to watch the Tyrant woo the Lady, so he can see truly everything he's lost. The Lady appears in black and says she can never bend her mind to love the Tyrant, since she's already in love with Govianus and will not give him up. Helvetius encourages the Lady to honor the Tyrant, but she kisses Govianus instead. The Tyrant revokes the banishment, since the Lady is set to depart with Govianus and he refuses to lose her. He's put under house arrest with Memphonius instead. The Lady is locked up too, within sight but out of reach of Govianus, to torment him. The Tyrant instructs Helvetius to move his daughter's heart. * Anselmus, Govianus's brother, worries over his wife's fidelity with his friend Votarius. He asks Votarius to try to cuckold him in order settle his mind. This is a great idea, because this kind of thing has never once backfired in the entire canon of early modern drama. Wife and Votarius talk about Anselmus, and Wife asks Votarius to help her cheer him up and return him from ‚Äúthe desolate path‚Äù because she misses him. Votarius tells Anselmo that his wife is chaste and loves him deeply. Anselmus refuses to believe this. Votarius tries again, this time actually hitting on Wife. In the process, he begins to fall in love with her a little and vows to go from hence and never see her more. She rebukes him, but then also begins to fall in love with him a little. Votarius departs. Wife calls Leonella, her companion, and tells her to never be away from her side, probably to help Wife keep herself in check. Leonella's lover, Bellarius, recognizes the departing Votarius as his enemy, and Leonella vows to let Votarius sleep with Wife so that Bellarius can have the pleasure of watching his enemy fall. ACT TWO * Lady and Govianus have befriended their guard, and as long as no one else is around, they have free access to each other and are happy. Helvetius comes to visit Lady and chastises her for her stubbornness and casts aspersions on her parentage. As she remains steadfast, he relents and commends her for her constancy, blesses her, and wishes her joy in Govianus. He then encourages her to take the Tyrant as her lover instead. Govianus enters and shoots at Helvetius, missing him on purpose. He berates Helvetius for forgetting his fatherly bonds and duties. Helvetius recalls himself and apologizes, pledging himself to Govianus, the rightful king. * Votarius rues his agreement to try Anselmus's wife, since it's led him astray and he's powerless to resist, though he recognizes his sin and error. They welcome Anselmus home, who seems to think he's found his wife and friend honest. Votarius wishes for a way out. Bellarius passes through, and Votarius vows to have him rid of the house. He tells Anselmus he suspects Bellarius of whoremongering, and Anselmus departs to slay him in the upstairs chamber. Bellarius jumps out a window to escape, and Votarius gives chase. Leonella protests that Bellarius is her husband and she would never allow him to sleep with the Wife, and offers instead to Anselmus proof that Votarius cuckolded him. * Helvetius returns to the Tyrant to tell him Lady isn't coming, and moreover, that Tyrant is a bad man. Tyrant strips Helvetius of all his titles, and Sophonirus claims them, saying he knows a special charm of ten words that will bring Lady to the Tyrant's bed immediately, and offers to leave his own wife in pawn to prove it. Tyrant throws Helvetius in prison. Tyrant sends Sophonirus to Lady with a jewel, and instructions to have her carried away by force if necessary. ACT THREE * Sophonirus arrives from the Tyrant to speak with the Lady. Govianus stabs Sophonirus. With his dying breath, Sophonirus tells them that the house is surrounded with men who will break in and steal away the Lady by force. Lady begs Govianus to murder her instead of letting her be stolen and raped by the Tyrant. She prays first and then declares herself ready to die. Govianus protests, but she insists and servants come knocking for Sophonirus. He runs at her with his sword, but faints before he strikes her. She kills herself. Govianus stirs, discovers her body and the servants still knocking, and uses Sophonirus's body to barricade the door. As the door is forced open, they stab Sophonirus's body, taking it to be Govianus. Govianus tells the Tyrant's servants that Sophonirus was cause of the Lady's death, and they carry that story back to the Tyrant, secure in their knowledge that they have done a good turn in killing Sophonirus (who was of course already dead). They carry his body out. ACT FOUR * Wife and Votarius set up an encounter designed to make the husband Anselmus think that his wife is faithful forever. This will then allow them to carry on with each other ever after. They'll hide Anselmus in a closet and let him watch Wife turn down Votarius with anger, which will prove her fidelity and his friend's willingness to help. Wife then tells Leonella to hide a weapon in her chamber and to rush to Votarius and remind him to wear ‚Äúprivy armor‚Äù so that she can strike him without fear. Leonella relates the plan to Bellarius, who counsels her to forget to remind Votarius to wear the armor, and by that forgetting, Votarius will be actually stabbed and Bellarius will have his revenge. Further, he tells Leonella to poison the weapon so that there's no hope of Votarius escaping. * The Tyrant is wound up over the news of Sophonirus's and the Lady's deaths. He tells Memphonius to order the execution of the messenger. He blames himself for the Lady's death and then orders Govianus's release. He asks for keys to the cathedral and a pickaxe so he can break open the Lady's tomb and hold her. * The soldiers refuse to help the Tyrant open the tomb, so he takes the tools and does it himself. He then orders them to move the body out of the tomb. The Tyrant kisses the body and then meditates on her coldness and how he will possess her now in spite of everything. He orders the soldiers to carry her body to the palace where he can have it embalmed and preserved and shower it with riches. * Govianus goes to visit the tomb. As he speaks to the body within, a voice says ‚ÄúI am not within.‚Äù He questions it, and then in a flash of light, the tomb bursts open to reveal the ghost of the Lady, all in white, with a crucifix and jewels. Her spirit tells him her body has been taken by the Tyrant and her rest disturbed, and Govianus vows to set it right as she vanishes. ACT FIVE * Votarius hides Anselmus in a closet. Leonella and Wife stage a conversation for Anselmus's benefit about how Wife will kill herself if Votarius won't leave her alone. Votarius enters and Wife puts him off, then stabs him with the poisoned sword. He dies, and Anselmus leaps from the closet. Accusing Leonella of slandering her mistress, he stabs her. Bellarius enters and challenges Anselmus. Wife gets between them on purpose, and they both kill her by ‚Äúrunning through the swords of Anselmus and Belarius to her death.‚Äù. They continue fighting and both wound each other. Anselmus dies first. Govianus arrives and Bellarius explains what has happened, and then dies. Anselmus revives, having heard the tale of his wife's wantonness, and curses his wife. He crawls away from her body and then dies for real. * The Tyrant's servants bring in the body of the Lady in a chair, dressed all in black and covered in a pearl chain with a crucifix. Music plays while he makes obeisance to her. Govianus arrives in the guise of a painter hired to make the Lady's portrait. The Tyrant instructs him to paint her face so that she looks alive, and Govianus does so begrudgingly. Tyrant takes up the body and kisses it, and then feels ill, at which point Govianus throws off his disguise and says the paint is poisoned. The Lady's ghost appears, terrifying the Tyrant and comforting Govianus. She thanks Govianus for his actions and departs, apparently at rest. The other nobles arrive and Tyrant tells them to arrest Govianus, but they pledge their allegiance to him instead. The Tyrant dies. Govianus directs them to crown the Lady's body as his queen before returning her to her tomb, and the court files out.

After seroconversion has occurred, the antibodies can be detected in blood tests for the disease. During an infection or immunization, antigens enter the blood, and the immune system begins to produce antibodies in response. Before seroconversion, the antigen itself may or may not be detectable, but the antibody is, by definition, absent. During seroconversion, the antibody is present but not yet detectable.  Mechanism  The physical structure of an antibody allows it to bind to a specific antigen to form a complex. Because of this binding, if the amounts of antigen and antibody in the blood are equal, each molecule will be in a complex and be undetectable by standard techniques. The antibody or antigen is only detectable in the blood when there is more of one than the other. Early in an infection, the antigen molecules outnumber the antibody molecules, and there will be unbound antigen that may be detectable, while all the antibody molecules are bound. After seroconversion, there is more antibody than antigen, so there is a detectable amount of free antibody, while all the antigen is bound and undetectable.  Terminology  During seroconversion, when the amounts of antibody and antigen are very similar, it may not be possible to detect free antigen or free antibody. This may give a false negative result when testing for the infection. This time is referred to as the window period. Serology (testing for antibodies) is used to determine if specific antibodies are in an organism's blood. Serostatus is a term denoting the presence or absence of particular antibodies in an individual's blood. Before seroconversion, the blood test is seronegative for the antibody; after seroconversion, the blood test is seropositive for the antibody. The word 'seroconversion' is often used in reference to blood testing for anti-HIV antibodies. In particular, \\"seroconverted\\" has been used to refer to the process of having \\"become HIV positive\\". Seroreversion is the opposite of seroconversion. This is when the tests can no longer detect antibodies in a patient's serum. Background The immune system maintains an immunological memory of infectious pathogens to facilitate early detection and to confer protective immunity against a rechallenge. This explains why many childhood diseases never recur in adulthood (and when they do, it generally indicates immunosuppression). It generally takes several days for B cells to begin producing antibodies. In the initial (primary infection) phase of the infection, immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies are produced and as these levels drop (and become undetectable) immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels rise and remain detectable. Immunoglobulin class switching often results in IgM-generating B-cells switching to IgG-generating B-cells. Upon reinfection, IgM antibodies usually do not rise again but IgG levels will increase. Thus an elevated IgM titre indicates recent primary infection, while the presence of IgG suggests past infection or immunization. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19) often does not follow the usual pattern, however, with IgM sometimes occurring after IgG, together with IgG or not occurring at all. Generally, however, median IgM detection occurs 5 days after symptom onset, whereas IgG is detected a median 14 days after symptom onset.

In 1754 he introduced the concept of a base into chemistry as a substance which reacts with an acid to form a salt). He is known as l'A√Æn√© (the elder) to distinguish him from his younger brother, Hilaire Rouelle, who was also a chemist and known as the discoverer of urea. He started a public course in his laboratory in 1738 where he taught many students among whom were Denis Diderot, Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier, Joseph Proust and Antoine-Augustin Parmentier. He was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1749. Why bases for neutral salts were called bases The modern meaning of the word \\"base\\" and its general introduction into the chemical vocabulary are usually attributed to the French chemist, Guillaume-Fran√ßois Rouelle (1703‚Äì1770), who used the term \\"Base\\" in a memoir on salts written in 1754 (see The Origin of the Term \\"Base\\" by William B. Jensen). In this paper, which was an extension of an earlier memoir on the same subject written in 1744, Rouelle pointed out that the number of known salts had increased significantly during the 17th and early 18th centuries. This was due not only to the preparation of new salts, but also to an increasing ability to distinguish between sodium and potassium compounds, and to a generalization of the concept so as to include many substances, such as the alums and vitriols (i.e., sulfates), that had been previously excluded. In order to incorporate this extended concept of salt formation, Rouelle explicitly defined a neutral salt as the product formed by the union of an acid with any substance, be it a water-soluble alkali, a volatile alkali, an absorbent earth, a metal, or an oil, capable of serving as \\"a base\\" for the salt \\"by giving it a concrete or solid form\\".

Nanumea is with a population of 512 people (2017 census). Geography Located along one edge of the so-called Polynesian triangle, Nanumea lies just south of the Gilbert Islands, which are Micronesian in language and culture. Nanumea is a classic atoll, a series of low islets sitting on a coral reef shelf surrounding a lagoon. About long by wide in overall size, the dry land area is about . The Nanumea Conservation Area covers about of the central lagoon and consists of about 10% of the reef area of the atoll, including marine habitats and 2 islets. A survey of the conservation zone was conducted in 2010. The largest villages are Haumaefa with 187 people (2012) and Lolua with 187 people (2012). The junior school is Kaumaile Primary School. There are scattered households across the lagoon from Nanumea village at Matagi and on Motu Foliki, and on the southeastern tip of Lakena islet. The two largest islets, comprising over 90% of the dry land area of the atoll, are Nanumea and Lakena. In addition there are three much smaller islets, Motu Foliki, Lafogaki and Te Afua-a- Taepoa spread around the encircling reef flat. The pulaka pits are located on Lakena as the Nanumeans want the main island of Nanumea to remain mosquito free. Pulaka is grown in large pits of composted soil below the water table. In March 2015 Nanumea suffered damage to houses, crops and infrastructure as the result of storm surges caused by Cyclone Pam. Language and cultural links Nanumeans are Polynesians. The Nanumean dialect of the Tuvaluan language is closely related to other west Polynesian languages, including the Tongan language, Tokelauan, Samoan, and the languages of the Polynesian outliers. Although the eight Tuvalu communities have distinctive accents and some distinctive vocabulary, the dialects of Tuvalu are mutually intelligible to Tuvalu speakers with the exception of the language of Nui atoll, whose inhabitants speak a dialect of the Gilbertese language (with the exception of small children, most Tuvaluans from Nui also speak Tuvaluan). With this exception, Tuvaluan is universally understood and spoken in Tuvalu. English is also spoken, especially in Tuvalu's capital, and is one of the official languages of the central government. History Canoe carving on Nanumea The rich mythical history of Nanumea describes a settlement led by an explorer/adventurer and warrior from the south named Tefolaha. Some accounts say Tefolaha and his crew came from Tonga, others name Samoa, but whether these names refer to today's Tonga and Samoa is not certain. Tefolaha, traditional accounts say, found the island of Nanumea populated by two women, Pai and Vau, whom it was believed had formed it from baskets of sand. Tefolaha wagered with them for the island and eventually won it through trickery, whereupon Pai and Vau departed. Tefolaha's sons and daughters are today the founding ancestors of leading families and the seven chiefly lineages of Nanumea. Today's population also traces descent from crew members who arrived with Tefolaha, and from later visitors from the far distant and more recent past. Nanumean traditions describe the islets, Motu Foliki, Lafogaki and Te Afua-a-Taepoa, as being formed when sand spilled from the baskets of two women, Pai and Vau, when they were forced off Nanumea by Tefolaha. The legendary, miraculous spear Kaumaile came with the hero Tefolaha to Nanumea. He fought with a long weapon on the islands of Samoa and Tonga. As Tefolaha died, \\"Kaumaile\\" went to his heirs, then to his heirs and on and on - 23 generations. The wood from the spear was radiocarbon dated to 880 years BP or AD 1070.http://www.nanumea.net/PDF%20files%20used%20in%20NEA%20website/Kaumaile%20Radiocarbon%20Dating%20Results,%202pp%20combined.pdf The wood is from the species Casuarina equisetifolia.http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/suedsee-speer- hamburger-forscher-bestimmt-holzart-a-971945.html The first recorded sighting of Nanumea by Europeans was by Spanish naval officer Francisco Mourelle de la R√∫a who sailed past it on 5 May 1781 with frigate La Princesa, when attempting a southern crossing of the Pacific from the Philippines to New Spain.

This passage improved access to Nanumea. B-24 Liberator aircraft of 30th Bombardment Group flew from Nanumea Airfield. After the war the airfield was dismantled and the land returned to its owners, however as the coral base was compacted to make the runway the land now provides poor ground for growing coconuts. Governance and connection to other Nanumean communities Nanumea's local government consists of a chiefly council (Falekaupule) representing the seven chiefly lines which trace descent from the founder, Tefolaha, or from other key settlers, and an elected high chief (Pulefenua). The island also elects and sends two representatives to the Tuvalu national parliament based in the capital, Funafuti. While Nanumea atoll remains the homeland for all Nanumeans, there are increasingly large populations of Nanumean residents in the capital, Funafuti, in New Zealand (especially Auckland and Wellington), and in Australia and other Pacific locations. These expatriate populations are well- organized, have active elected leadership councils, and keep in close touch with doings in Nanumea itself. General election, 2019 Maatia Toafa and Satini Manuella were not returned to parliament at the 2019 general election. Ampelosa Manoa Tehulu and Timi Melei were elected to represent Nanumea. Identity Nanumea street scene (2008) Nanumean identity and pride is demonstrated in many ways, from the distinctive intonation pattern and vocabulary of its version of Tuvaluan to celebrations including its unique Po o Tefolaha, part of a long holiday covering Christmas, New Year and some weeks beyond. These \\"Big Days\\" (Po Lahi) celebrations, marked with noon feasts in the island's community hall, the aahiga or maneapa, feature a marathon round of the competitive ball game Ano, pitting the two village sides, Haumaefa and Lolua, against each other. On 8 January each year, the island's conversion to Christianity over a century ago is commemorated in the Po o Tefolaha, Tefolaha's Day. Po Lahi is celebrated in Nanumea itself and by many Nanumean communities overseas, including those in Funafuti, Fiji, Auckland, Wellington, Tarawa, Australia and other locations. A widely recognized symbol of Nanumean identity and unity is the fighting spear, \\"Kaumaile.\\"More about the Kaumaile Said to have been brought with him by the island's founder, Tefolaha, Kaumaile was used to defeat invaders to Nanumea, most notably by Lapi to defeat a giant, Tuulaapoupou. Recent carbon dating tests have shown that the Kaumaile spear is over 800 years old.Nanumea Website Prominent local people Lady Naama Maheu Latasi (died 16 March 2012) was the first woman to be elected to the Parliament of Tuvalu, was elected from the constituency of Nanumea. Maatia Toafa (born 1 May 1954) was the Prime Minister of Tuvalu 2004‚Äì2006 and continues to represent Nanumea in the Parliament of Tuvalu. On 5 August 2013 Maatia Toafa was appointed the Minister of Finance and Economic Development in the government led by Enele Sopoaga. Willy Telavi (born 28 January 1954) was first elected to parliament in 2006 and was appointed Home Affairs Minister in the Government of Apisai Ielemia. He was re-elected in 2010 and became the Prime Minister of Tuvalu on 24 December 2010. His term of prime minister ended on 2 August 2013. He resigned from Parliament in August 2014.

Thad Taylor's production of Sir John Oldcastle (1986) Sir John Oldcastle is an Elizabethan play about John Oldcastle, a controversial 14th-/15th-century rebel and Lollard who was seen by some of Shakespeare's contemporaries as a proto-Protestant martyr. Publication Title page of Sir John Oldcastle Q1 (1600) The play was originally published anonymously in 1600 (Q1), printed by Valentine Simmes for the bookseller Thomas Pavier. In 1619, a new edition (Q2) carried an attribution to William Shakespeare.The 1619 edition of the play was part of William Jaggard's so-called False Folio. The diary of Philip Henslowe records that the play was written by Anthony Munday, Michael Drayton, Richard Hathwaye and Robert Wilson. (An entry in Henslowe's Diary records a later payment to Drayton for a second part to the play, which has not survived; because of this fact, the extant play has sometimes been called Sir John Oldcastle, Part I or 1 Sir John Oldcastle.) In 1664, the play was one of the seven dramas added to the second impression of the Shakespeare Third Folio by publisher Philip Chetwinde. Historical figure Like other subjects of Elizabethan history plays, Sir John Oldcastle was an actual person, a soldier and Lollard dissenter who was hanged and burned for heresy and treason in 1417‚Äîthus earning himself a place in the seminal text of the Protestant Reformation in Tudor England, John Foxe's Book of Martyrs. Oldcastle was also a minor character in the early Elizabethan history play the Famous Victories of Henry V (c. 1586?), which is generally thought to have been one of Shakespeare's sources for his plays on Henry IV and Henry V. Shakespeare's Oldcastle The genesis of Sir John Oldcastle is crucially linked to the fact that when Shakespeare's Henry IV plays premiered on stage in 1597‚Äì98, the character Sir John Falstaff was called Sir John Oldcastle. This is indicated by abundant external and internal evidence. The change of names, from \\"Oldcastle\\" to \\"Falstaff\\", is mentioned in seventeenth-century works by Richard James (Epistle to Sir Harry Bourchier, c. 1625) and Thomas Fuller (Worthies of England, 1662). It is also indicated in details in the early texts of Shakespeare's plays. In the quarto text of Henry IV, Part 2 (1600), one of Falstaff's speech prefixes in Act I, Scene ii is mistakenly left uncorrected, \\"Old.\\" instead of \\"Falst.\\" In III,ii,25‚Äì26 of the same play, Falstaff is said to have been a \\"page to Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk\\"‚Äîwhich was true of the historical Oldcastle. In Henry IV, Part 1, I,ii,42, Prince Hal calls Falstaff \\"my old lad of the castle\\". Iambic pentameter verse lines in both parts are irregular when using the name \\"Falstaff\\", but correct with \\"Oldcastle\\". Finally, there is the blatant disclaimer at the close of Henry IV, Part 2 that disassociates the two figures: \\"for Oldcastle died [a] martyr, and this is not the man\\" (Epilogue, 29‚Äì32). There is even a hint that Falstaff was originally Oldcastle in The Merry Wives of Windsor too. When the First Folio and quarto texts of that play are compared, it appears that the joke in V,v,85‚Äì90 is that Oldcastle/Falstaff incriminates himself by calling out the first letter of his name, \\"O, O, O!,\\" when his fingertips are singed with candles‚Äîwhich of course works for \\"Oldcastle\\" but not \\"Falstaff.\\" There is also the \\"castle\\" reference in IV,v,6 of the same play.Scoufos, Shakespeare's Typological Satire, p. 191. The name Falstaff was derived from Sir John Fastolf, who was also a historical person‚Äîallegedly a greedy and grasping individual, who had a (probably undeserved) reputation for cowardice at the Battle of Patay in 1429. Fastolf, however, died without descendants, making him safe for a playwright's use. He had already appeared as a cowardly knight in Henry VI, part 1. The Lords Cobham The name change and the Epilogue disclaimer were required, it is generally thought, because of political pressure: the historical Oldcastle was not only a Protestant martyr, but a nobleman with powerful living descendants in Elizabethan England. These were the Lords Cobham: William Brooke, 10th Baron Cobham (died 6 March 1597), was Warden of the Cinque Ports (1558‚Äì97), Knight of the Order of the Garter (1584), and member of the Privy Council (1586‚Äì97); his son Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham, was granted the paternal post of Warden of the Cinque Ports upon his father's death, and made a Knight of the Order of the Garter in 1599. Even more so, Frances Brooke, the 10th Baron's wife and 11th Baron's mother, was a close personal favorite of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth I (an Elizabethan could not have been more or better connected than the Cobhams). The elder Lord Cobham even had a strong negative impact upon the lives of Shakespeare and his contemporaries in the theater. The company of actors formed by Shakespeare, Richard Burbage, Will Kempe and the others in 1594 enjoyed the patronage of Henry Carey, first Lord Hunsdon, then serving as Lord Chamberlain; they were, famously, the Lord Chamberlain's Men. When Carey died on 22 July 1596, the post of Lord Chamberlain was given to William Brooke, Lord Cobham, who definitely was not a friend to the players, and who withdrew what official protection they had enjoyed. The players were left to the mercies of the local officials of the City of London, who had long wanted to drive the companies of actors out of the City. Thomas Nashe, in a contemporary letter, complained that the actors were \\"piteously persecuted by the Lord Mayor and the aldermen\\" during this period. This did not last; when Cobham died less than a year later, the post of Lord Chamberlain went to Henry Carey's son George, second Lord Hunsdon, and the actors regained their previous patronage.Halliday, Shakespeare Companion, p. 107; Scoufos, p.99. Soon after the premier of Shakespeare's Oldcastle/Falstaff in 1597‚Äì98, literary and dramatic works began to appear that defended the reputation of the historical Oldcastle; scholars argue that the muse that inspired these works was Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham. In 1601 a narrative poem, The Mirror of Martyrs, by one John Weever, was published; it praises Oldcastle as a \\"valiant captain and most godly martyr.\\" And two years earlier, in 1599, the play Sir John Oldcastle was performed by the Admiral's Men, the main theatrical rivals of Shakespeare's company. Curiously, this effort to redeem the Oldcastle name was at best only partially successful; allusions to the Falstaff character under the name of Oldcastle continued to appear in succeeding years‚Äîin Nathan Field's play Amends for Ladies (1618) and in the anonymous pamphlets The Meeting of Gallants at an Ordinary (1604) and The Wandering Jew (c. 1628), among other works.Scoufos, pp. 36‚Äì40. Politics Sir John Oldcastle treats its subject matter in ways acceptable to the values and biases of its audience, and the interests of Elizabethan officialdom (inevitably; if it did anything else it would never have escaped censorship). Oldcastle is a religious but not a political dissenter; his quarrel is with the Roman Catholic Church, and he remains loyal to the Crown and to Henry V personally (II,iii). The villain of the piece is the Bishop of Rochester, aided by his summoner Clun. The same cast of rebels and conspirators is active in this play (II,ii, III,ii, etc.) as in Henry V, but Oldcastle keeps scrupulously separate from them. The play offers a comic character, Sir John of Wrotham, a pale imitation of Falstaff, who interacts with a disguised Henry V (III,iv) much as in Shakespeare's plays. The later scenes are devoted to Rochester's pursuit of Oldcastle and his wife, and their escapes; the play ends on a temporary positive note, with the Oldcastles evading imprisonment. (Presumably, the lost second half of the play would have had the inevitable grimmer ending of Oldcastle's grisly death.) Notes References * Dominik, Mark.

History James Prescott Joule first published in December 1840, an abstract in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, suggesting that heat could be generated by an electrical current. Joule immersed a length of wire in a fixed mass of water and measured the temperature rise due to a known current flowing through the wire for a 30 minute period. By varying the current and the length of the wire he deduced that the heat produced was proportional to the square of the current multiplied by the electrical resistance of the immersed wire. In 1841 and 1842, subsequent experiments showed that the amount of heat generated was proportional to the chemical energy used in the voltaic pile that generated the template This led Joule to reject the caloric theory (at that time the dominant theory) in favor of the mechanical theory of heat (according to which heat is another form of energy). Resistive heating was independently studied by Heinrich Lenz in 1842. The SI unit of energy was subsequently named the joule and given the symbol J. The commonly known unit of power, the watt, is equivalent to one joule per second. Microscopic description Joule heating is caused by interactions between charge carriers (usually electrons) and the body of the conductor (usually atomic ions). A voltage difference between two points of a conductor creates an electric field that accelerates charge carriers in the direction of the electric field, giving them kinetic energy. When the charged particles collide with ions in the conductor, the particles are scattered; their direction of motion becomes random rather than aligned with the electric field, which constitutes thermal motion. Thus, energy from the electrical field is converted into thermal energy. Power loss and noise Joule heating is referred to as ohmic heating or resistive heating because of its relationship to Ohm's Law. It forms the basis for the large number of practical applications involving electric heating. However, in applications where heating is an unwanted by-product of current use (e.g., load losses in electrical transformers) the diversion of energy is often referred to as resistive loss. The use of high voltages in electric power transmission systems is specifically designed to reduce such losses in cabling by operating with commensurately lower currents. The ring circuits, or ring mains, used in UK homes are another example, where power is delivered to outlets at lower currents (per wire, by using two paths in parallel), thus reducing Joule heating in the wires. Joule heating does not occur in superconducting materials, as these materials have zero electrical resistance in the superconducting state. Resistors create electrical noise, called Johnson‚ÄìNyquist noise. There is an intimate relationship between Johnson‚ÄìNyquist noise and Joule heating, explained by the fluctuation- dissipation theorem. Formulas =Direct current= The most fundamental formula for Joule heating is the generalized power equation: :P=I(V_{A}-V_{B}) where * P is the power (energy per unit time) converted from electrical energy to thermal energy, * I is the current travelling through the resistor or other element, * V_{A}-V_{B} is the voltage drop across the element. The explanation of this formula (P=IV) is:Electric power systems: a conceptual introduction by Alexandra von Meier, p67, Google books link :(Energy dissipated per unit time) = (Charge passing through resistor per unit time) √ó (Energy dissipated per charge passing through resistor) Assuming the element behaves as a perfect resistor and that the power is completely converted into heat, the formula can be re-written by substituting Ohm's law, V = I \\\\cdot R , into the generalized power equation: :P=IV=I^2R=V^2/R where R is the resistance. =Alternating current= When current varies, as it does in AC circuits, :P(t)=U(t)I(t) where t is time and P is the instantaneous power being converted from electrical energy to heat. Far more often, the average power is of more interest than the instantaneous power: :P_{\\\\rm avg}=U_\\\\text{rms}I_\\\\text{rms}=I_\\\\text{rms}^2R=U_\\\\text{rms}^2/R where \\"avg\\" denotes average (mean) over one or more cycles, and \\"rms\\" denotes root mean square. These formulas are valid for an ideal resistor, with zero reactance. If the reactance is nonzero, the formulas are modified: :P_{\\\\rm avg} = U_\\\\text{rms}I_\\\\text{rms}\\\\cos\\\\phi = I_\\\\text{rms}^2 \\\\operatorname{Re}(Z) = U_\\\\text{rms}^2 \\\\operatorname{Re}(Y^*) where \\\\phi is phase difference between current and voltage, \\\\operatorname{Re} means real part, Z is the complex impedance, and Y* is the complex conjugate of the admittance (equal to 1/Z*). For more details in the reactive case, see AC power‚àÜ0} =Differential form= Joule heating can also be calculated at a particular location in space. The differential form of the Joule heating equation gives the power per unit volume. :\\\\mathrm{d}P/\\\\mathrm{d}V=\\\\mathbf{J} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{E} Here, \\\\mathbf{J} is the current density, and \\\\mathbf{E} is the electric field. For a material with a conductivity \\\\sigma, \\\\mathbf{J}=\\\\sigma \\\\mathbf{E} and therefore :\\\\mathrm{d}P/\\\\mathrm{d}V=\\\\mathbf{J} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{E}=\\\\mathbf{J} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{J}\\\\rho = J^2/\\\\sigma where \\\\rho=1/\\\\sigma is the resistivity. This directly resembles the \\"I^2R\\" term of the macroscopic form. In the harmonic case, where all field quantities vary with the angular frequency \\\\omega as e^{-\\\\mathrm{i} \\\\omega t}, complex valued phasors \\\\hat\\\\mathbf{J} and \\\\hat\\\\mathbf{E} are usually introduced for the current density and the electric field intensity, respectively. The Joule heating then reads :\\\\mathrm{d}P/\\\\mathrm{d}V= \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\hat\\\\mathbf{J} \\\\cdot \\\\hat\\\\mathbf{E}^*=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\hat\\\\mathbf{J} \\\\cdot \\\\hat\\\\mathbf{J}^*\\\\rho = \\\\frac{1}{2}J^2/\\\\sigma, where \\\\bullet^* denotes the complex conjugate. High- voltage alternating current transmission of electricity Overhead power lines transfer electrical energy from electricity producers to consumers. Those power lines have a nonzero resistance and therefore are subject to Joule heating, which causes transmission losses. The split of power between transmission losses (Joule heating in transmission lines) and load (useful energy delivered to the consumer) can be approximated by a voltage divider. In order to minimize transmission losses, the resistance of the lines has to be as small as possible compared to the load (resistance of consumer appliances). Line resistance is minimized by the use of copper conductors, but the resistance and power supply specifications of consumer appliances are fixed. Usually, a transformer is placed between the lines and consumption. When a high-voltage, low-intensity current in the primary circuit (before the transformer) is converted into a low-voltage, high-intensity current in the secondary circuit (after the transformer), the equivalent resistance of the secondary circuit becomes higher and transmission losses are reduced in proportion. During the war of currents, AC installations could use transformers to reduce line losses by Joule heating, at the cost of higher voltage in the transmission lines, compared to DC installations. Applications Joule-heating or resistive-heating is used in multiple devices and industrial process. The part which converts electricity into heat by Joule heating is called a heating element. There are many practical uses of Joule heating: * An incandescent light bulb glows when the filament is heated by Joule heating, due to thermal radiation (also called blackbody radiation). * Electric fuses are used as a safety, breaking the circuit by melting if enough current flows to melt them. * Electronic cigarettes vaporize propylene glycol and vegetable glycerine by Joule heating. * Multiple heating devices use Joule heating, such as electric stoves, electric heaters, soldering irons, cartridge heaters. * Some food processing equipment may make use of Joule heating: running current through food material (which behave as an electrical resistor) causes heat release inside the food. The alternating electrical current coupled with the resistance of the food causes the generation of heat. A higher resistance increases the heat generated. Ohmic heating allows for fast and uniform heating of food products, which keeps the high quality in foods. Products with particulates heat up faster in Ohmic heating (as compared to conventional heat processing) due to higher resistance. = Food processing = Joule heating (Ohmic heating) is a flash pasteurization (also called \\"high-temperature short-time\\" (HTST)) aseptic process that runs an alternating current of 50‚Äì60 Hz through food. Heat is generated through the electrical resistance of the food. As the product heats up, electrical conductivity increases linearly. A higher electrical current frequency is best as it reduces oxidation and metallic contamination. This heating method is best for foods that contain particulates suspended in a weak salt-containing medium due to their high resistance properties. Ohmic heating allows for a maintained quality of foods due to the uniform heating that decreases deterioration and over-processing of food. Heating efficiency As a heating technology, Joule heating has a coefficient of performance of 1.0, meaning that every joule of electrical energy supplied produces one joule of heat. In contrast, a heat pump can have a coefficient of more than 1.0 since it moves additional thermal energy from the environment to the heated item. The definition of the efficiency of a heating process requires defining the boundaries of the system to be considered. When heating a building, the overall efficiency is different when considering heating effect per unit of electric energy delivered on the customer's side of the meter, compared to the overall efficiency when also considering the losses in the power plant and transmission of power.

Astronaut experience Harris first became interested in being an astronaut watching the Apollo 11 mission on TV in 1969. Selected by NASA in January 1990, Harris became an astronaut in July 1991, and qualified for assignment as a mission specialist on future Space Shuttle flight crews. He served as the crew representative for Shuttle Software in the Astronaut Office Operations Development Branch. Harris was assigned as a mission specialist on STS-55, Spacelab D-2, in August 1991. He flew on board Columbia for ten days, (26 April 1993 - 6 May 1993); on the mission the Shuttle reached one year of accumulated flight time. Harris was part of the payload crew of Spacelab D-2, conducting a variety of research in physical and life sciences. During this flight, Harris logged over 239 hours and 4,164,183 miles in space. His second mission was as the Payload Commander on STS-63 ( February 2, 1995 - February 11, 1995), the first flight of the new joint Russian-American Space Program. Mission highlights included the first rendezvous (but not docking) with the Russian space station Mir and retrieval of Spartan 204 satellite. During the flight, Harris became the first African-American to walk in space, while fellow astronaut Michael Foale became the first British-born spacewalker. (It was also on this flight that Eileen Collins became the first female Shuttle pilot.) On this mission, Harris logged 198 hours, 29 minutes in space, completed 129 orbits, and traveled over 2.9 million miles.

This tractate is one of five contained within Codex V of the Nag Hammadi library.  Content  Adam in his 700th year tells Seth how he learned a word of knowledge of the eternal God from Eve and that he and Eve were indeed more powerful than their supposed creator. But that knowledge was lost in the fall when the subcreator - the demiurge - separated Adam and Eve. Adam relates how three mysterious strangers brought about Seth's begetting and so a preservation of this knowledge. Adam then prophesizes at length attempts of the subcreator god to destroy mankind, including the prophecy of the great Deluge and of attempted destruction by fire but an Illuminator will come in the end. When the Illuminator comes, thirteen kingdoms proclaim thirteen different standard but conflicting birth legends about the Illuminator; only the \\"generation without a king,\\" however, proclaims the truth.

Discovery Arrowhead Mountain Spring Water takes its name from a natural mark in the San Bernardino Mountains that is shaped like a giant arrowhead. The arrowhead is naturally barren; it is not manicured in any way. Native American legend says the formation was burned into the mountain by the fall of an arrow from Heaven, showing the way to the healing hot springs. Nearby cold springs on Strawberry Creek in the San Bernardino National Forest are the original source and namesake of Arrowhead water. The first documented reference to Arrowhead springs (Agua Caliente) was in records of priests stationed at Mission San Gabriel Arc√°ngel, around 1820. David Noble Smith was the founder of the first sanitarium facilities at Arrowhead Springs in 1863, which were used to treat patients with tuberculosis and numerous other ailments. By the 1880s, the Arrowhead waters were famous for their supposed curing powers. By the early 20th century, the hot springs were a popular resort for tourism and vacationing.  History  In 1909, The Arrowhead Springs Company was formed and the company's water products were marketed in Southern California. The water was transported from Arrowhead Springs, north of San Bernardino, California, to Los Angeles in glass-lined railroad tank cars. In 1917, the bottling operations moved to a new plant in Los Angeles. In 1929, the Arrowhead Springs Company merged with the company that marketed Puritas water, and began co-marketing the Puritas products with Arrowhead water. Puritas water products were first introduced in Los Angeles in 1894. The Arrowhead and Puritas brands were bottled in the same plants and co- marketed until the 1970s. Arrowhead Springs marketed the brands in separate containers that sometimes carried the Arrowhead or Puritas names alone, but containers were often labeled \\"Arrowhead and Puritas.\\" The Arrowhead Beverage Company was the bottler for many different brands of water and soft drinks including seltzer, fruit-flavored soda, and ginger ale. In 1932, another important development for the company happened in the Los Angeles area, as it was named the official water refreshment of that year's Olympic Games, held at the City of the Stars. Arrowhead water returned to the Olympic Games again in 1984, when the games were again held in Los Angeles. In 1993, Arrowhead water bought the naming rights for the Arrowhead Pond in Anaheim. 1.5 Liter Bottle of Arrowhead. The bottle is similar to fellow Nestl√© brands Deer Park, Poland Spring, and Nestl√© Pure Life. The Nestl√© era In 1987, Arrowhead waters was bought by Nestl√©. Soon after, the presence of Arrowhead water bottles in supermarkets across the Western United States grew considerably. In 1996, a bottle was introduced by the company. By the early 2000s, the company had introduced waters with different flavors to the market. It's Better Up Here! is a trademarked tagline for the Arrowhead Water brand. In 2006, Aquapod was released in this brand. In December, 2017, the California Water Resources Control Board notified Nestl√© that an investigation had concluded that the company does not have proper rights to about three-quarters of the water it withdraws for bottling, including water from the San Bernardino National Forest.

Gameplay Block Out (Sega Mega Drive version) The player's perspective is that of looking down into a three-dimensional rectangular pit. Polycube blocks of various shapes appear, one at a time, and fall slowly toward the bottom of the pit. The player can use three buttons to rotate the block around any of the three coordinate axes, and can also maneuver the block horizontally and vertically with a joystick. Once any part of a block comes to rest on the floor of the pit or in contact with an already-placed cube, it freezes in place and can no longer be moved. The player can press a button on the joystick to quickly drop a block. Once a solid layer of cubes is formed with no gaps (a \\"face\\"), it disappears and all cubes above it drop toward the bottom of the pit to fill the space. Completing multiple faces with a single block awards higher scores, and the player earns a \\"Block Out\\" bonus for completely emptying the pit. A set number of faces must be completed in order to end each round. As the game progresses, the blocks begin to drop faster, the dimensions of the pit change from round to round, and differently-shaped blocks begin to appear. A bonus stage is played after every fifth round, in which the player has 30 seconds to form as many faces as possible in a 2x2 pit. The game ends if the blocks stack up to the top of the pit, with the exception of the bonus stages; in the latter case, the stage ends immediately and the player advances to the next round. The game allows head-to-head competition between two players, each of whom has their own pit and blocks. When one player completes a face, all the cubes in the opponent's pit are raised by one level. To win a round, a player must either be the first to complete a set number of faces or must force their opponent's cubes to stack up to the top of the pit. Ports and sequel Despite the other known console ports of Blockout, there were also two for NES: the first is an official unreleased prototype developed in 1990 by Technos Japan Corp. under the name \\"Block Out\\", while the second is an unauthorized clone programmed by Hwang Shinwei and published by both himself and RCM Group in 1989/1990 (titled 3D Block). Blockout also saw a port on Virtual Boy entitled 3D Tetris (March 22, 1996), though the game suffers greatly from the lack of colors beyond red and black. Around 2007blockout II - Downloads on sourceforge a modernized, authorized continuation/remakeBlockout II on reloaded.org named \\"Blockout II\\"blockout2 on blockout.net was released with a license from Kadon Enterprises, Inc., to use the trademarked \\"Blockout\\" name.The Blockout story on gamepuzzles.com (Kadon Enterprises) \\"Jean-Luc Pons, a self-declared addicted Blockout player in France, has created an improved C++ clone of the original Blockout version and offers Blockout II as an open source project for other addicted players.

Tom Henricks left government service in November 1997 to pursue a career in business. He held the position of President of McGraw-Hill's Aviation Week, based in New York City until his departure in 2010 to pursue other opportunities. Space flight experience STS-44 Atlantis launched the night of November 24, 1991. The primary mission objective was the deployment of a Defense Support Program (DSP) satellite with an Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) rocket booster. The mission was concluded after 110 orbits of the Earth returning to a landing on the lakebed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on December 1, 1991. STS-55, the German D-2 Spacelab mission, was launched on April 26, 1993, aboard Columbia, and landed 10 days later on May 6, 1993, at Edwards AFB California. During the ambitious mission 89 experiments were performed in many disciplines such as materials processing, life sciences, robotics, technology, astronomy, and Earth mapping. STS-70 launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on July 13, 1995, and returned there July 22, 1995. During 142 orbits of the Earth, the crew performed a variety of experiments in addition to deploying the sixth and final NASA Tracking and Data Relay Satellite. STS-70, with an \\"all-Ohio\\" crew, was the first mission controlled from the new combined control center. STS-78 launched June 20, 1996 and landed July 7, 1996, becoming the longest Space Shuttle mission to date (later that year the STS-80 mission broke its record by 19 hours.) The 16-day mission included studies sponsored by 10 nations and five space agencies, and was the first mission to combine both a full microgravity studies agenda and a comprehensive life science investigation. The Life and Microgravity Spacelab mission served as a model for future studies on board the International Space Station. References External links *Spacefacts biography of Terence T.

The intermediate station, or node in a networking context, verifies the integrity of the message before forwarding it. In general, this technique is used in networks with intermittent connectivity, especially in the wilderness or environments requiring high mobility. It may also be preferable in situations when there are long delays in transmission and variable and high error rates, or if a direct, end-to-end connection is not available.  Modern store and forward networking  * Store and forward originates with delay-tolerant networks. No real-time services are available for these kinds of networks. * Logistical Networking is a scalable form of store and forward networking that exposes network-embedded buffers on intermediate nodes and allows flexible creation of services by higher-level managers including caching, point-to-multipoint communication (or multicast), content delivery and many other stateful distributed services.Beck, M.; Moore, T.; Plank, J.; Swany, M.:\\"Logistical Networking\\", Active Middleware Services, pp. 141-154. Springer US, 2000 Real time services can be created using logistical networking when data transfer connectivity permits. A store-and-forward switching center is a message switching center in which a message is accepted from the originating user, i.e., sender, when it is offered, held in a physical storage, and forwarded to the destination user, i.e., receiver, in accordance with the priority placed upon the message by the originating user and the availability of an outgoing channel. Store and forward switching centers are usually implemented in mobile service stations where the messages that are sent from the sender is first sent to these centers. If the destination address isn't available, then the center stores this message and tries sending it later. This improves the probability of the message to be delivered. In the other case, if the destination is available at that time, then the message is immediately sent.  Manually operated relay  Store and forward networks predate the use of computers. Point-to-point teleprinter equipment was used to send messages which were stored at the receiving end on punched paper tape at a relay center. A human operator at the center removed the message tape from the receiving machine, read the addressing information, and then sent it toward its destination on appropriate outbound point-to-point teleprinter link. If the outbound link was in use, the operator placed the message in tape in a physical queue, usually consisting of a set of clips or hooks. A major relay center in the mid 1900s might have dozens of inbound and outbound teleprinters, scores of operators, and thousands of messages in the queues during peak periods. Operators referred to these centers as \\"torn-tape relay centers,\\" a reference to removing the received message from the inbound teleprinter by tearing the paper tape to separate one message from the next. The U.S. military term for such a center was \\"Non-Automated Relay Center\\" (NARC).  Automatic relay  In 1948, Western Union introduced Plan 55-A, the first automatic electromechanical store and forward message switching system. All message storage was performed by paper tape punches paired with paper tape readers, with a bin in between. Email It is very common for an email system to accept a message, store it and then forward it on elsewhere. Although fully open mail relays are no longer common, not only does simple server-based forwarding work this way, but also many email filtering and automated electronic mailing lists services. UUCP Prior to the deployment of the Internet, computers were connected via a variety of point-to-point techniques, with many smaller computers using dial-up connections. The UUCP store-and-forward protocols allowed a message (typically e-mail) to move across the collection of computers and eventually reach its destination. Late in the 20th century, store and forward techniques evolved into packet switching which replaced it for most purposes. FidoNet FidoNet was an email store-and-forward system for bulletin board systems that peaked at 45,000 systems with millions of users across the world. The system was highly efficient, using the latest file compression and file transfer systems to aggressively drive down the cost of transmission on what was largely a hobby network. The system was later modified to support public messages (forums) called EchoMail, which grew to about 8 MB a day, compressed.

Experience Hilmers entered active duty with the United States Marine Corps in July 1972. On completing The Basic School and Naval Flight Officer School, he was assigned to VMA(AW)-121 at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina, flying the A-6 Intruder as a bombardier- navigator. In 1975, he became an air liaison officer with the 1st Battalion, 2nd Marines, stationed with the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in 1978 and was later assigned to the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing at Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan. He was stationed with the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, California, at the time of his selection by NASA. NASA experience Hilmers was selected a NASA astronaut in July 1980 and completed the initial training period in August 1981. In 1983 he was selected as a member of the launch-ready standby crew. His early NASA assignments have included work on rocket upper stages such as PAM, IUS, and Centaur, as well as Shuttle software verification at the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL). In addition, he was the Astronaut Office training coordinator, worked on various Department of Defense payloads, served as a spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) at Mission Control for STS-41-D, STS-41-G, STS-51-A, STS-51-C and STS-51-D, worked Space Station issues for the Astronaut Office, and served as head of the Mission Development Branch within the Astronaut Office. In May 1985 he was named to the crew of STS-61-F, which was to deploy the Ulysses spacecraft on an interplanetary trajectory using a Centaur upper stage. This mission was to have flown in May 1986, but the Shuttle Centaur project was terminated in July 1986, and Hilmers then worked in the areas of ascent abort development, payload safety, and Shuttle on-board software. During 1987 he was involved in training for STS-26 and in flight software development. He later became head of the Mission Development branch in the astronaut office. A veteran of four space flights, he has logged over 493 hours in space. He served as a mission specialist on STS-51-J (October 3‚Äì7, 1985), STS-26 (September 29 to October 3, 1988), STS-36 (February 28 to March 4, 1990), and STS-42 (January 22‚Äì30, 1992). Hilmers retired from NASA and the United States Marine Corps in October 1992, and went on to complete medical school and residency in the combined Internal Medicine/Pediatrics program at Baylor College of Medicine. He currently holds the rank of Professor in the departments of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, the Center for Space Medicine, and Baylor Global Initiatives at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. In addition to his teaching and clinical duties, he is involved in research in global health and malnutrition in many countries. He spends much of his spare time providing humanitarian medical care locally in Houston and in developing nations, including disaster relief efforts in Iraq, Peru, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Haiti, and in Liberia during the Ebola outbreak in 2014. Space flight experience STS-51-J Atlantis, a classified Department of Defense mission, launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on October 3, 1985. This was the maiden voyage of the Orbiter Atlantis. Hilmers had prime responsibility for a number of on-orbit activities during the mission. After 98 hours of orbital operations, Atlantis landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on October 7, 1985. STS-26 Discovery, the first mission to be flown after the Challenger accident, was launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on September 29, 1988. During the four-day mission, the crew successfully deployed the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS-C), which was subsequently carried to orbit by the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) rocket. They also operated eleven mid- deck experiments. Discovery completed 64 orbits of the Earth before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on October 3, 1988. STS-36 Atlantis launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on February 28, 1990. This mission carried Department of Defense payloads and a number of secondary payloads. After 72 orbits of the Earth, the STS-36 mission concluded with a lakebed landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on March 4, 1990, after traveling 1.87 million miles. STS-42 Discovery launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on January 22, 1992. Fifty-five major experiments conducted in the International Microgravity Laboratory-1 module were provided by investigators from eleven countries, and represented a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines. During 128 orbits of the Earth, the STS-42 crew accomplished the mission's primary objective of investigating the effects of microgravity on materials processing and life sciences. In this unique laboratory in space, crew members worked around-the-clock in two shifts. Experiments investigated the microgravity effects on the growth of protein and semiconductor crystals. Biological experiments on the effects of zero gravity on plants, tissues, bacteria, insects and human vestibular response were also conducted. This eight-day mission culminated in a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on January 30, 1992. References External links *Spacefacts biography of David C.

The Brooklyn Museum is an art museum located in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. At , the museum is New York City's third largest in physical size and holds an art collection with roughly 1.5 million works. Located near the Prospect Heights, Crown Heights, Flatbush, and Park Slope neighborhoods of Brooklyn and founded in 1895, the Beaux-Arts building, designed by McKim, Mead and White, was planned to be the largest art museum in the world. The museum initially struggled to maintain its building and collection, only to be revitalized in the late 20th century, thanks to major renovations. Significant areas of the collection include antiquities, specifically their collection of Egyptian antiquities spanning over 3,000 years. European, African, Oceanic, and Japanese art make for notable antiquities collections as well. American art is heavily represented, starting at the Colonial period. Artists represented in the collection include Mark Rothko, Edward Hopper, Norman Rockwell, Winslow Homer, Edgar Degas, Georgia O'Keeffe, and Max Weber. The museum also has a \\"Memorial Sculpture Garden\\" which features salvaged architectural elements from throughout New York City. History The roots of the Brooklyn Museum extend back to the 1823 founding by Augustus Graham of the Brooklyn Apprentices' Library in Brooklyn Heights. The Library moved into the Brooklyn Lyceum building on Washington Street in 1841. Two years later the institutions merged to form the Brooklyn Institute, which offered exhibitions of painting and sculpture and lectures on diverse subjects. In 1890, under its director Franklin Hooper, Institute leaders reorganized as the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences and began planning the Brooklyn Museum. The museum remained a subdivision of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, along with the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, and the Brooklyn Children's Museum until the 1970s when all became independent. Opened in 1897, the Brooklyn Museum building is a steel frame structure clad in masonry, designed in the neoclassical revival style by the architectural firm of McKim, Mead, and White and built by the Carlin Construction Company. The initial design for the Brooklyn Museum was four times as large as the built version; the final design reflects a compromise to the specifications of the New York City government. Daniel Chester French, the sculptor of the statue of Abraham Lincoln in the Lincoln Memorial, was the principal designer of the pediment sculptures and the monolithic figures along the cornice. The figures were created by 11 sculptors and carved by the Piccirilli Brothers. French also designed the two allegorical figures Brooklyn and Manhattan currently flanking the museum's entrance, created in 1916 for the Brooklyn approach to the Manhattan Bridge and relocated to the museum in 1963. Early 20th century postcard By 1920, the New York City Subway reached the museum with a subway station; this greatly improved access to the once-isolated museum from Manhattan and other outer boroughs. The Brooklyn Institute's director Franklin Hooper was the museum's first director, succeeded by William Henry Fox who served from 1914 to 1934. He was followed by Philip Newell Youtz (1934‚Äì1938), Laurance Page Roberts (1939‚Äì1946), Isabel Spaulding Roberts (1943‚Äì1946), Charles Nagel, Jr. (1946‚Äì1955), and Edgar Craig Schenck (1955‚Äì1959). Thomas S. Buechner became the museum's director in 1960, making him one of the youngest directors in the country. Buechner oversaw a major transformation in the way the museum displayed art and brought some one thousand works that had languished in the museum's store rooms and put them on display. Buechner played a pivotal role in rescuing the Daniel Chester French sculptures from destruction due to an expansion project at the Manhattan Bridge in the 1960s. Duncan F. Cameron held the post from 1971 to 1973, with Michael Botwinick succeeding him (1974‚Äì1982) and Linda S. Ferber acting director for part of 1983 until Robert T. Buck became director in 1983 and served until 1996. The Brooklyn Museum changed its name to Brooklyn Museum of Art in 1997, shortly before the start of Arnold L. Lehman's term as director. On March 12, 2004, the museum announced that it would revert to its previous name. In April 2004, the museum opened the James Polshek-designed entrance pavilion on the Eastern Parkway facade. In September 2014, Lehman announced that he was planning to retire around June 2015. In May 2015, Creative Time president and artistic director Anne Pasternak was named the museum's next director; she assumed the position on September 1, 2015. Funding The Brooklyn Museum, along with numerous other New York institutions, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the American Museum of Natural History, and the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, is part of the Cultural Institutions Group (CIG). Member institutions occupy land or buildings owned by the City of New York and derive part of their yearly funding from the City. The Brooklyn Museum also supplements its earned income with funding from Federal and State governments, as well as with donations by individuals and organizations. In 1999, the museum hosted the Charles Saatchi exhibition Sensation, resulting in a court battleBrooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences v. City of New York, 64 F.Supp.2d 184 (E.D.N.Y. Nov 01, 1999) over New York City's municipal funding of institutions exhibiting controversial art, eventually decided in favor of the museum on First Amendment grounds. In 2005, the museum was among 406 New York City arts and social service institutions to receive part of a $20 million grant from the Carnegie Corporation, in turn funded by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. Major benefactors include Frank Lusk Babbott. The museum is the site of the annual Brooklyn Artists Ball which has included celebrity hosts such as Sarah Jessica Parker and Liv Tyler. Controversially, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and its negative impact on museum revenue, the museum raised operating costs by deaccessioning. The October 2020 sale consists of 12 Old Masters, including works of Lucas Cranach the Elder, Gustave Courbet, and Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot. Though usually prohibited by the Association of Art Museum Directors, the association has allowed such sales to proceed for a two-year window through 2022. Art and exhibitions The Brooklyn Museum exhibits collections that seek to embody the artistic heritage of world cultures. The museum is well known for its expansive collections of Egyptian and African art, in addition to 17th-, 18th-, 19th-, and 20th-century paintings, sculpture, and decorative arts throughout a wide range of schools. In 2002, the museum received the work The Dinner Party, by feminist artist Judy Chicago, as a gift from The Elizabeth A. Sackler Foundation. Its permanent exhibition began in 2007, as a centerpiece for the museum's Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art. In 2004, the Brooklyn Museum featured Manifest Destiny, an oil-on-wood mural by Alexis Rockman that was commissioned by the museum as a centerpiece for the second-floor Mezzanine Gallery and marked the opening of the museum's renovated Grand Lobby and plaza. Other exhibitions have showcased the works of various contemporary artists including Patrick Kelly, Chuck Close, Denis Peterson, Ron Mueck, Takashi Murakami, Mat Benote, Kiki Smith, Jim Dine, Robert Rauschenberg, Ching Ho Cheng, Sylvia Sleigh and William Wegman, and a 2004 survey show of work by Brooklyn artists, Open House: Working in Brooklyn. In 2008, curator Edna Russman announced that a third of the Coptic art held in the museum's collection‚Äîsecond-largest in North America‚Äîis fake. Of 30 works of art, Russman believes 10 are faked. The fake artworks will be displayed in an exhibition starting in 2009. Collections =Egyptian, Classical, and Ancient Near Eastern Art= The Brooklyn Museum has been building a collection of Egyptian artifacts since the beginning of the twentieth century, incorporating both collections purchased from others, such as that of American Egyptologist Charles Edwin Wilbour, whose heirs also donated his library to become the museum's Wilbour Library of Egyptology, and objects obtained during museum-sponsored archeological excavations. The Egyptian collection includes objects ranging from statuary, such as the well-known \\"Bird Lady\\" terra cotta figure, to papyrus documents (among others the Brooklyn Papyrus). The Egyptian, Classical, and Ancient Near Eastern collections are housed in a series of galleries in the museum. Egyptian artifacts can be found in the long-term exhibit, Egypt Reborn: Art for Eternity, as well as in the Martha A. and Robert S. Rubin Galleries. Near Eastern artifacts are located in the Hagop Kevorkian Gallery.

In 1855, the museum officially designated a collection of American Art, with the first work commissioned for the collection being a landscape painting by Asher B. Durand. Items in the American Art collection include portraits, pastels, sculptures, and prints; all items in the collection date to between c. 1720 and c. 1945. Represented in the American Art collection are works by artists such as William Edmondson (Angel, date unknown), John Singer Sargent's Paul C√©sar Helleu sketching his wife Alice Gu√©rin (ca. 1889); Georgia O'Keeffe's Dark Tree Trunks (ca. 1946), and Winslow Homer's Eight Bells (ca. 1887). Among the most famous works in the collection are Gilbert Stuart's portrait of George Washington and Edward Hicks's The Peaceable Kingdom. The museum also holds a collection by Emil Fuchs. Works from the American Art collection can be found in various areas of the museum, including in the Steinberg Family Sculpture Garden and in the exhibit, American Identities: A New Look, which is contained within the museum's Visible Storage ‚ñ™ Study Center. In total, there are approximately 2,000 American Art objects held in storage.

The collection was expanded in 1922 with items originating largely in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In 1923 the museum hosted one of the first exhibitions of African art in the United States. With more than 5,000 items in its collection, the Brooklyn Museum boasts one of the largest collections of African art in any American art museum. Although the title of the collection suggests that it includes art from all of the African continent, works from Africa are sub- categorized among a number of collections. Sub-Saharan art from West and Central Africa are collected under the banner of African Art, while North African and Egyptian art works are grouped with the Islamic and Egyptian art collections, respectively. The African art collection covers 2,500 years of human history and includes sculpture, jewellery, masks, and religious artifacts from more than 100 African cultures. Noteworthy items in this collection include a carved ndop figure of a Kuba king, believed to be among the oldest extant ndop carvings, and a Lulua mother-and-child figure. In 2018, the museum drew criticism from groups including Decolonize This Place for its hiring of a white woman as Consulting Curator of African Arts.

Art in this collection is sourced to numerous Pacific and Indian Ocean islands including Hawaii and New Zealand, as well as less-populous islands such as Rapa Nui and Vanuatu. Many of the Marquesan items in the collection were acquired by the museum from famed Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl. Art objects in this collection are crafted from a wide variety of materials. The museum lists \\"coconut fiber, feathers, shells, clay, bone, human hair, wood, moss, and spider webs\\" as among the materials used to make artworks that include masks, tapa cloths, sculpture, and jewellery. =Arts of the Islamic World= The museum also has art objects and historical texts produced by Muslim artists or about Muslim figures and cultures.

Sackler Center for Feminist Art= The museum's center for feminist art opened in 2007; it is dedicated to preserving the history of the movement since the late 20th century, as well as raising awareness of feminist contributions to art, and informing the future of this area of artistic dialogue. Along with an exhibition space and library, the center features a gallery housing a masterwork by Judy Chicago, a large installation called The Dinner Party (1974-1979). =European art= The Brooklyn Museum has among others late Gothic and Early Italian Renaissance paintings by Lorenzo di Niccolo (\\"Scenes from the life of Saint Lawrence\\"), Sano di Pietro, Nardo di Cione, Lorenzo Monaco, Donato de' Bardi (\\"Saint Jerome\\"), Giovanni Bellini. It has Dutch paintings by Frans Hals, Gerard Dou, and Thomas de Keyser as well as others. It has 19th-century French paintings by Charles Daubigny, Narcisse Virgilio D√≠az, Eug√®ne Boudin (\\"Port, Le Havre\\"), Berthe Morisot, Edgar Degas, Gustave Caillebotte (\\"Railway Bridge at Argenteuil\\"), Claude Monet (\\"Doges Palace, Venice\\"), the French sculptor Alfred Barye, Camille Pissarro, and Paul C√©zanne as well as many others.

The collection began in 1823 and is housed in facilities that underwent renovations in 1965, 1984 and 2014. Programs In 2000, the Brooklyn Museum started the Museum Apprentice Program in which the museum hires teenage high schoolers to give tours in the museum's galleries during the summer, assist with the museum's weekend family programs throughout the year, participate in talks with museum curators, serve as a teen advisory board to the museum, and help plan teen events. The first Saturday of each month, the Brooklyn Museum stays open until 11pm. General admission is waived from 5 to 11pm, although some ticketed exhibitions may require an entrance fee. Regular first Saturday activities include educational family-oriented activities such as collection-based art workshops, gallery tours, lectures, live performances dance parties. The museum has posted many pieces to a digital collection online which features a user-based tagging system that allows the public to tag and curate sets of objects online, as well as solicit additional scholarship contributions. The Museum Education Fellowship Program is a ten-month position in which Fellows acquire theoretical and practical skills to lead K-12 school group visits with a focus on various topics from the collection. School Youth and Family Fellows teach Gallery Studio Programs and School Partnerships while Adult and Public Programs Fellows curate and organize Thursday night as well as First Saturday Programming. The museum has also received attention for its recent ASK App in which visitors can interface with staff and educators regarding works in the collection through a mobile application downloadable through the Apple and Google application stores. \\"Populism\\" James Tissot, The Disciples Having Left Their Hiding Place Watch from Afar in Agony, c. 1886-1894 Attendance at the Brooklyn Museum has been in decline in recent years, from a high \\"decades ago\\" of nearly one million visitors per year to more recent figures of 585,000 (1998) and 326,000 (2009). The New York Times attributed this drop partially to the policies instituted by then-current director Arnold Lehman, who has chosen to focus the museum's energy on \\"populism\\", with exhibits on topics such as \\"Star Wars movies and hip-hop music\\" rather than on more classical art topics. Lehman had also brought more controversial exhibits, such as a 1999 show that included Chris Ofili's infamous dung-decorated The Holy Virgin Mary, to the museum. According to the Times: > The quality of their exhibitions has lessened\\", said Robert Storr, the dean > of the Yale University School of Art and a Brooklynite. \\"Star Wars shows the > worst kind of populism. I don't think they really understand where they are. > The middle of the art world is now in Brooklyn; it's an increasingly > sophisticated audience and always was one. On the other hand, Lehman points out that the demographics of museum attendees are showing a new level of diversity. According to The New York Times, \\"the average age [of museum attendees in a 2008 survey] was 35, a large portion of the visitors (40 percent) came from Brooklyn, and more than 40 percent identified themselves as people of color.\\" Lehman asserts that the museum's interest is in being welcoming and attractive to all potential museum attendees, rather than simply amassing large numbers of them.

His most recent spaceflight was in November 2009, STS-129 on Atlantis again; this time he was designated Commander. In total, he has logged 36 days in space. Education In 1980 he graduated from North Ridgeville High School, North Ridgeville, Ohio. In 1984 he received a Bachelor of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering from the United States Naval Academy. From January 1993 to August 1994 he attended the University of Tennessee Space Institute. He is a member of the U.S. Naval Academy Alumni Association. Awards and honors Hobaugh has received several awards and honors, including those listed below. * U.S. Naval Academy Distinguished Graduate * Joe Foss Award for Advanced Jet Training * U.S. Naval Test Pilot School Distinguished Graduate * Strike/Flight Air Medal * Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal * Combat Action Ribbon * Navy Unit Commendation Military career Hobaugh received his commission as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps upon graduation from the U.S. Naval Academy in May 1984. He graduated from The Basic School in December 1984. After a six- month temporary assignment at the Naval Air Systems Command, he reported to Naval Aviation Training Command and was designated a Naval Aviator in February 1987. He then reported to VMAT-203 for initial AV-8B Harrier training. Upon completion of this training, he was assigned to VMA-331 and made overseas deployments to Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan, and flew combat missions in the Persian Gulf during Operation Desert Storm embarked aboard the . While assigned to VMA-331, he attended Marine Aviation Warfare and Tactics Instructor Course and was subsequently assigned as the Squadron Weapons and Tactics Instructor. Hobaugh was selected for U.S. Naval Test Pilot School and began the course in June 1991. After graduation in June 1992, he was assigned to the Strike Aircraft Test Directorate as an AV-8 Project Officer and as the ASTOVL/JAST/JSF Program Officer. While there, he flew the AV-8B, YAV-8B (VSRA) and A-7E. In July 1994, he went back to the Naval Test Pilot School as an instructor in the Systems Department, where he flew the F-18, T-2 Buckeye, U-6A and gliders. Hobaugh was assigned to the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School when he was selected for the astronaut program. In September 2010 he retired from the U.S. Marine Corps. Prior to the launch of STS-118, several reporters asked Hobaugh the meaning of his call-sign, \\"Scorch\\". Hobaugh has yet to explain it, saying he probably won't; he feels it sounds better if you don't know the origin of the name. He did admit that it is related to his days of flying Harrier jets in the Marines, but would say no more than that. Hobaugh has logged over 5,000 flight hours in more than 40 different aircraft and has over 200 V/STOL shipboard landings. NASA career Selected by NASA in April 1996, Hobaugh reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1996. He completed two years of training and evaluation, and was qualified for flight assignment as a pilot. Hobaugh was initially assigned technical duties in the Astronaut Office Spacecraft Systems/Operations Branch. Projects included Landing and Rollout, evaluator in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL), Advanced Projects, Multifunction Electronics Display Enhancements, Advanced and Upgrade, Rendezvous and Close Proximity Operations and Visiting Vehicles prior to his first flight assignment. Most recently, he served as Capsule Communicator, working in the Mission Control Center as the voice to the crew. Hobaugh was the reentry and landing CAPCOM for the STS-107 mission, on which the Space Shuttle Columbia was destroyed on reentry. He spoke the words \\"Columbia, Houston. UHF Comm Check\\" several times after Mission Control had lost contact with Columbia. =STS-104= Hobaugh flew as the pilot of STS-104 (July 12‚Äì24, 2001). This mission was the tenth mission to the International Space Station (ISS). During the 13-day flight the crew conducted joint operations with the Expedition 2 crew and performed three spacewalks to install the Quest Joint Airlock and to outfit it with four high-pressure gas tanks. The mission was accomplished in 200 Earth orbits, traveling 5.3 million miles in 306 hours and 35 minutes. =STS-118= He flew as pilot on STS-118 in August 2007 for 13 days. =STS-129= Hobaugh served as commander on the STS-129 mission aboard for 10 days in November 2009. Civilian career Hobaugh was hired by FedEx in 2011 and is currently flying as captain on the Boeing 777. Personal life Hobaugh is married to the former Corinna Lynn Leaman of East Petersburg, Pennsylvania; they have four children. He enjoys weight lifting, volleyball, boating, water skiing, snow skiing, soccer, bicycling, running, rowing and triathlon. His parents, Jimmie and Virginia Hobaugh, reside in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. His wife's parents, Jerry and Dottie Leaman, reside in East Petersburg, Pennsylvania.

Chief Warrant Officer 4 Thomas John Hennen (born August 17, 1952) is a United States Army warrant officer and NASA payload specialist astronaut who flew aboard Space Shuttle mission STS-44 as a payload specialist. Personal Hennen was born on August 17, 1952, in Albany, Georgia, and was raised all over the world. He now lives in Houston, Texas. Tom is married to the former Sherri Wise of Houston. Together, they have six children, Kristopher, Jessie, Karl, Kyle, Kendall, and Karli and one grandchild, Mila Michelle. He enjoys playing basketball, bowling, dancing, snorkeling, scuba diving, sky diving, traveling, and listening to music. His father, Chief Master Sergeant Carl H. Hennen (USAF), and his mother, Antoinette L. Hennen, are both deceased. Education Hennen graduated from Groveport-Madison High School in Groveport, Ohio in 1970. He attended Urbana College in Urbana, Ohio from 1970-1972 on both an academic and athletic scholarship. Military career Hennen was the first Warrant Officer within the U.S. Army and Department of Defense to have been selected as a member of a Space Shuttle flight crew. Hennen served over 24 years in the imagery intelligence field. He received extensive technical training and experience as an operational imagery analyst at both the national and tactical intelligence levels; experience as an instructor; training, force, and combat developer; extensive material development and acquisition management experience--all of which combined to make him one of the most qualified imagery intelligence technicians within the Department of Defense. From 1973 to 1975, he was assigned to the 163rd Military Intelligence Battalion, Fort Hood, Texas. During this assignment he participated in the planning, development, and conduct of major operational and force development tests and evaluations in direct support of U.S. Army and III Corps combat requirements. A small sample of these tests included: the evaluation of the effectiveness of various firing methodologies of the AH-1 Cobra attack helicopter; the testing and evaluation of new camouflage netting, uniforms, and painted vehicles, now in use throughout the Army; the initial U.S. Army Remotely piloted vehicle testing; phosphorus smoke tests; antenna mast tests; and heat loss/energy conservations tests. During 1976 through 1978, Hennen was assigned to the 203rd Military Intelligence Detachment. While there he served as Operations NCO and the chief of both the Tactical and Strategic Exploitation Divisions, providing imagery collection, exploitation, and intelligence support to the 1st Cavalry Division, the 2nd Armored Division, the 6th Armored Cavalry Regiment, and Headquarters III Corps. Hennen was assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence Center, Fort Huachuca, Arizona, from 1981 through 1986. He was the project officer for the Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) Tactical Exploitation of National Space Capabilities Program (TENCAP), responsible for developing all training requirements, concept, and doctrine. His efforts culminated in the production of multimillion-dollar training programs, supporting the fielding of a variety of new systems, operating at both the tactical and national intelligence levels. During this assignment, Hennen was appointed as Department of the Army IMINT subject matter expert. He developed and managed a major project for the Office of the Secretary of Defense; he authored the U.S. Army Radar Training Plan; participated in the development of the TENCAP Systems Management Model; was selected as a member of a Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) team that developed the Joint Space Intelligence and Operations Course; and represented the Army on the DIA Intelligence Training Equipment Subcommittee. In 1986, Hennen was selected by the Commanding General of the U.S. Army Intelligence Center to represent him within the U.S. Army Space Program Office (ASPO) in Washington, D.C., for those matters pertaining to TENCAP requirements, concept development, and the doctrinal and operational employment of TENCAP systems. Additionally, he participated in various Army, DOD, and National Intelligence Community working groups and subcommittees involved in TENCAP program activities. Hennen was personally responsible for managing the development and successful fielding of a state-of-the-art IMINT system to both the European and Pacific Theaters of Operations. Chief Hennen's efforts at ASPO were instrumental in the efficient evolution of 5 major TENCAP systems with a Life Cycle Cost in excess of $2 billion US dollars, providing critical and timely intelligence in support of the requirements of the tactical commander on the extended battlefield.  Astronaut career  Hennen was selected as a payload specialist candidate in September 1988 and moved back to the \\"Home of Military Intelligence\\", Fort Huachuca, Arizona, during March 1989 to begin Terra Scout payload operations training. During August 1989 he was selected as the primary payload specialist for the Terra Scout experiment manifested on STS-44, and reported to NASA in 1990 to begin Payload Specialist and Space Shuttle Crew Training. Hennen became the first Warrant Officer in space, flying aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-44), which launched from Kennedy Space Center Pad 39A at 6:44 PM (EST), November 24, 1991. He orbited the Earth 109 times, traveling 2.9 million miles (4.7 million km), before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California on December 1, 1991. Hennen retired from the U.S. Army in December 1995. He is the co-founder and currently serves as the Executive Director of the Atlantis Foundation, a non- profit organization that is both an advocate and a service provider for people with developmental disabilities. Awards and honors Hennen has been awarded many special honors, including the Legion of Merit, Meritorious Service Medal with two oak leaf clusters, Defense Superior Service Medal, Army Commendation Medal, Army Achievement Medal with oak leaf cluster, NASA Space Flight Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal; and the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award with oak leaf cluster. Hennen was selected on numerous occasions as Soldier and Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) of the Quarter/Year by the various commands and agencies to which he was assigned during his enlisted career.

For instance, in the case of a manufactured product, environmental impacts are assessed from raw material extraction and processing (cradle), through the product's manufacture, distribution and use, to the recycling or final disposal of the materials composing it (grave). An LCA study involves a thorough inventory of the energy and materials that are required across the industry value chain of the product, process or service, and calculates the corresponding emissions to the environment. LCA thus assesses cumulative potential environmental impacts. The aim is to document and improve the overall environmental profile of the product. Widely recognized procedures for conducting LCAs are included in the 14000 series of environmental management standards of the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO), in particular, in ISO 14040 and ISO 14044. Criticisms have been leveled against the LCA approach, both in general and with regard to specific cases, e.g., in the consistency of the methodology, particularly with regard to system boundaries, and the susceptibility of particular LCAs to practitioner bias with regard to the decisions that they seek to inform. Definition, synonyms, goals, and purpose Life-cycle assessment (LCA) is sometimes referred to synonymously as life-cycle analysis in the scholarly and agency report literatures.. It is also sometimes referred to as \\"cradle-to- grave analysis\\". As stated by the National Risk Management Research Laboratory of the EPA, \\"LCA is a technique to assess the environmental aspects and potential impacts associated with a product, process, or service, by: * Compiling an inventory of relevant energy and material inputs and environmental releases * Evaluating the potential environmental impacts associated with identified inputs and releases * Interpreting the results to help you make a more informed decision\\". Hence, it is a technique to assess environmental impacts associated with all the stages of a product's life from raw material extraction through materials processing, manufacture, distribution, use, repair and maintenance, and disposal or recycling. Designers use this process to help critique their products. The goal of LCA is to compare the full range of environmental effects assignable to products and services by quantifying all inputs and outputs of material flows and assessing how these material flows affect the environment. This information is used to improve processes, support policy and provide a sound basis for informed decisions. The term life-cycle refers to the notion that a fair, holistic assessment requires the assessment of raw-material production, manufacture, distribution, use and disposal including all intervening transportation steps necessary or caused by the product's existence. There are two main types of LCA. Attributional LCAs seek to attribute the burdens associated with the production and use of a product, or with a specific service or process, at a point in time, typically in the recent past. Consequential LCAs seek to identify the environmental consequences of a decision or a proposed change in a system under study, and thus are oriented to the future and require that market and economic implications must be taken into account. A third type of LCA, termed \\"social LCA\\" is also under developmentGuidelines for Social Life Cycle Assessment of Products , United Nations Environment Programme, 2009. This third type is a distinct approach to that is intended to assess potential social implications and impacts. Social Life Cycle Assessment (SLCA) is a useful tool for companies to identify and assess potential social impacts along the lifecycle of a product or service on various stakeholders (for example: workers, local communities, consumers). SLCA is framed by the UNEP/SETAC‚Äôs Guidelines for social life cycle assessment of products published in 2009 in Quebec. The tool builds on the ISO 26000:2010 Guidelines for Social Responsibility and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Guidelines. Some widely recognized procedures for LCA are included in the ISO 14000 series of environmental management standards, in particular, ISO 14040 and 14044.E.g., see For the a PDF of the 1997 version, see this Stanford University course reading.E.g., see ISO 14044 replaced earlier versions of ISO 14041 to ISO 14043. Greenhouse gas (GHG) product life cycle assessments can also comply with specifications such as Publicly Available Specification (PAS) 2050 and the GHG Protocol Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard.\\"PAS 2050:2011 Specification for the assessment of the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of goods and services\\".

Main ISO phases of LCA According to standards in the ISO 14040 and 14044, an LCA is carried out in four distinct phases, as illustrated in the figure shown at the above right (at opening of the article). The phases are often interdependent, in that the results of one phase will inform how other phases are completed. =Goal and scope= An LCA starts with an explicit statement of the goal and scope of the study, which sets out the context of the study and explains how and to whom the results are to be communicated. This is a key step and the ISO standards require that the goal and scope of an LCA be clearly defined and consistent with the intended application. The goal and scope document, therefore, includes technical details that guide subsequent work: * the functional unit, which defines precisely what is being studied, quantifies the service delivered by the system, provides a reference to which the inputs and outputs can be related, and provides a basis for comparing/analysing alternative goods or services. * the system boundaries, which delimit which processes should be included in the analysis of a system, including whether the system produces any co-products that must be accounted for by system expansion or allocation. * any assumptions and limitations; *data quality requirements, which specify the kinds of data that will be included and what restrictions (date range, completeness, county or region of study, etc.) will be applied. * the allocation methods, which are used to partition an environmental load of a process when several products or functions share the same process. Allocation is commonly dealt with in one of three ways: system expansion, substitution, and partition. Choice of allocation method for co-products can significantly impact results of an LCA * the impact categories, which might include such categories as human toxicity, smog, global warming, and eutrophication. =Inventory= This is an example of a Life-cycle inventory (LCI) diagram Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) analysis involves creating an inventory of flows from and to nature for a product system. Inventory flows include inputs of water, energy, and raw materials, and releases to air, land, and water. To develop the inventory, a flow model of the technical system is constructed using data on inputs and outputs. The flow model is typically illustrated with a flow chart that includes the activities that are going to be assessed in the relevant supply chain and gives a clear picture of the technical system boundaries. The input and output data needed for the construction of the model are collected for all activities within the system boundary, including from the supply chain (referred to as inputs from the technosphere). The data must be related to the functional unit defined in the goal and scope definition. Data can be presented in tables and some interpretations can be made already at this stage. The results of the inventory is an LCI which provides information about all inputs and outputs in the form of elementary flow to and from the environment from all the unit processes involved in the study. Inventory flows can number in the hundreds depending on the system boundary. For product LCAs at either the generic (i.e., representative industry averages) or brand-specific level, that data is typically collected through survey questionnaires. At an industry level, care has to be taken to ensure that questionnaires are completed by a representative sample of producers, leaning toward neither the best nor the worst, and fully representing any regional differences due to energy use, material sourcing or other factors. The questionnaires cover the full range of inputs and outputs, typically aiming to account for 99% of the mass of a product, 99% of the energy used in its production and any environmentally sensitive flows, even if they fall within the 1% level of inputs. One area where data access is likely to be difficult is flows from the technosphere. The technosphere is more simply defined as the human-made world. Considered by geologists as secondary resources, these resources are in theory 100% recyclable; however, in a practical sense, the primary goal is salvage. For an LCI, these technosphere products (supply chain products) are those that have been produced by human and unfortunately those completing a questionnaire about a process which uses a human-made product as a means to an end will be unable to specify how much of a given input they use. Typically, they will not have access to data concerning inputs and outputs for previous production processes of the product. The entity undertaking the LCA must then turn to secondary sources if it does not already have that data from its own previous studies. National databases or data sets that come with LCA-practitioner tools, or that can be readily accessed, are the usual sources for that information. Care must then be taken to ensure that the secondary data source properly reflects regional or national conditions. LCI methods include \\"process LCAs\\",, economic input‚Äìoutput LCA (EIOLCA), and hybrid approaches. =Impact assessment= Inventory analysis is followed by a life-cyle impact assessment (LCIA). This phase of LCA is aimed at evaluating the significance of potential environmental impacts based on the life-cycle impact flow results. Classical LCIAs consist of the following mandatory elements: * selection of impact categories, category indicators, and characterization models; * the classification stage, where the inventory parameters are sorted and assigned to specific impact categories; and * impact measurement, where the categorized LCI flows are characterized, using one of many possible LCIA methodologies, into common equivalence units that are then summed to provide an overall impact category total. In many LCAs, characterization concludes the LCIA analysis, it is the last compulsory stage according to ISO 14044. However, in addition to the above mandatory LCIA steps, other optional LCIA elements‚Äìnormalization, grouping, and weighting‚Äìmay be conducted depending on the goal and scope of the LCA study. In normalization, the results of the impact categories from the study are usually compared with the total impacts in the region of interest, e.g., the United States. Grouping consists of sorting and possibly ranking the impact categories. During weighting, the different environmental impacts are weighted relative to each other so that they can then be summed to get a single number for the total environmental impact. ISO 14044 generally advises against weighting, stating that \\"weighting, shall not be used in LCA studies intended to be used in comparative assertions intended to be disclosed to the public\\". This advice is often ignored, resulting in comparisons that can reflect a high degree of subjectivity as a result of weighting. Life cycle impacts can also be categorized under the several phases of the development, production, use, and disposal of a product. Broadly speaking, these impacts can be divided into first impacts, use impacts, and end of life impacts. First impacts include extraction of raw materials, manufacturing (conversion of raw materials into a product), transportation of the product to a market or site, construction/installation, and the beginning of the use or occupancy. Use impacts include physical impacts of operating the product or facility (such as energy, water, etc.), and any maintenance, renovation, or repairs that are required to continue to use the product or facility. End of life impacts include demolition and processing of waste or recyclable materials. =Interpretation= Life-cycle interpretation is a systematic technique to identify, quantify, check, and evaluate information from the results of the life cycle inventory and/or the life cycle impact assessment. The results from the inventory analysis and impact assessment are summarized during the interpretation phase. The outcome of the interpretation phase is a set of conclusions and recommendations for the study. According to ISO 14040, the interpretation should include: * identification of significant issues based on the results of the LCI and LCIA phases of an LCA; * evaluation of the study considering completeness, sensitivity and consistency checks; and * conclusions, limitations and recommendations. A key purpose of performing life cycle interpretation is to determine the level of confidence in the final results and communicate them in a fair, complete, and accurate manner. Interpreting the results of an LCA is not as simple as \\"3 is better than 2, therefore Alternative A is the best choice\\". Interpretation begins with understanding the accuracy of the results, and ensuring they meet the goal of the study. This is accomplished by identifying the data elements that contribute significantly to each impact category, evaluating the sensitivity of these significant data elements, assessing the completeness and consistency of the study, and drawing conclusions and recommendations based on a clear understanding of how the LCA was conducted and the results were developed. Specifically, as voiced by M.A. Curran, the goal of the LCA interpretation phase is to identify the alternative that has the least cradle-to-grave environmental negative impact on land, sea, and air resources. LCA uses At the time of a survey of LCA practitioners in 2006, LCA was being used to support business strategy and R&D; (18% each, of total applications surveyed); other uses included LCA as an input to product or process design (15%), its use in education (13%), and its use for labeling or product declarations (11%). It has been suggested that LCA will be continuously integrated into building practices through the development and implementation of appropriate tools‚Äîe.g., the European ENSLIC Building project guidelines‚Äîthat guide practitioners in applying LCI data methods to planning, design, and construction. Major corporations all over the world are either undertaking LCA in house or commissioning studies, while governments support the development of national databases to support LCA. Of particular note is the growing use of LCA for ISO Type III labels called Environmental Product Declarations, defined as \\"quantified environmental data for a product with pre-set categories of parameters based on the ISO 14040 series of standards, but not excluding additional environmental information\\". Third-party certification plays a major role in today's industry, and third-party certified LCA-based labels provide an increasingly important basis for assessing the relative environmental merits of competing products. In particular, such independent certification is described as indicating a company's dedication to providing clients with safe and environmentally friendly products. LCA also has major roles in environmental impact assessment, integrated waste management and pollution studies. Important recent studies applying LCA include: * A study evaluating the LCA of a laboratory scale plant for oxygen enriched air production coupled with its economic evaluation from an eco-design standpoint. * An assessment of the environmental impacts of pavement maintenance, repair, and rehabilitation activities. Data analysis A life cycle analysis is only as accurate and valid as is its basis set of data. There are two fundamental types of LCA data‚Äìunit process data, and environmental input-output (EIO) data. Unit process data are derived from direct surveys of companies or plants producing the product of interest, carried out at a unit process level defined by the system boundaries for the study. EIO data are based on national economic input-output data. Data validity is an ongoing concern for life cycle analyses. If LCA conclusions are to be valid, data used in the LCA inventory must accurate and valid, and so, with regard to validity, recent. Moreover, when comparing a pair of LCAs for different products, processes, or services, it is crucial that data of equivalent quality are available for the pair being compared. If one of the pair, e.g., a product, has a much higher availability of accurate and valid data, it cannot be justly compared to another product which has lower availability of such data. With regard to the timeliness of data, it has been noted that data validity can be at odds with the time that data-gathering takes. Due to globalization and the pace of research and development, new materials and manufacturing methods are continually being introduced to the market, making it both important and difficult to identify and apply up-to-date information. For instance, in the consumer electronics sector, products such as cell phones may be redesigned as often as every 9 to 12 months, creating a need for rapid, ongoing data collection.If a product and its component production processes are not significantly changed since the last date of LCA data collection, data validity is no more of a current issue that for the previous LCA. As noted above, the inventory in the LCA usually considers a number of stages including: materials extraction, processing and manufacturing, product use, and product disposal. If the most environmentally harmful of these stages can be determined, then impact on the environment can be efficiently reduced by focusing on making changes for that particular phase. For example, the most energy-intensive stage in the LCA of an aircraft or automobile product is during its use, as a result of fuel consumption during the product lifetime. An effective ways to increase fuel efficiency is to decrease vehicle weight; hence, aircraft and automobile manufacturers can decrease environmental impact through replacement of heavier materials with lighter ones (e.g., aluminium or carbon fiber-reinforced elements), all specifications and other costs being equal.Reduction of impact occurring during the use phase must then be more than enough to balance other impacts, e.g., from additional raw materials or increased manufacturing cost. Data sources used in LCAs are typically large databases. It is not appropriate to compare two options if different data sources have been used to source the data. Common data sources include: Calculations for impact can then be done by hand, but it is more usual to streamline the process by using software. This can range from a simple spreadsheet, where the user enters the data manually to a fully automated program, where the user is not aware of the source data. Variants =Cradle-to-grave= Cradle-to-grave is the full Life Cycle Assessment from resource extraction ('cradle') to use phase and disposal phase ('grave'). For example, trees produce paper, which can be recycled into low- energy production cellulose (fiberised paper) insulation, then used as an energy-saving device in the ceiling of a home for 40 years, saving 2,000 times the fossil-fuel energy used in its production. After 40 years the cellulose fibers are replaced and the old fibers are disposed of, possibly incinerated. All inputs and outputs are considered for all the phases of the life cycle. =Cradle-to-gate= Cradle-to-gate is an assessment of a partial product life cycle from resource extraction (cradle) to the factory gate (i.e., before it is transported to the consumer). The use phase and disposal phase of the product are omitted in this case. Cradle-to-gate assessments are sometimes the basis for environmental product declarations (EPD) termed business-to-business EPDs. One of the significant uses of the cradle-to-gate approach compiles the life cycle inventory (LCI) using cradle-to-gate. This allows the LCA to collect all of the impacts leading up to resources being purchased by the facility. They can then add the steps involved in their transport to plant and manufacture process to more easily produce their own cradle-to-gate values for their products. =Cradle-to-cradle or closed loop production= Cradle-to- cradle is a specific kind of cradle-to-grave assessment, where the end-of-life disposal step for the product is a recycling process. It is a method used to minimize the environmental impact of products by employing sustainable production, operation, and disposal practices and aims to incorporate social responsibility into product development. From the recycling process originate new, identical products (e.g., asphalt pavement from discarded asphalt pavement, glass bottles from collected glass bottles), or different products (e.g., glass wool insulation from collected glass bottles). Allocation of burden for products in open loop production systems presents considerable challenges for LCA. Various methods, such as the avoided burden approach have been proposed to deal with the issues involved. =Gate-to-gate= Gate-to- gate is a partial LCA looking at only one value-added process in the entire production chain. Gate-to-gate modules may also later be linked in their appropriate production chain to form a complete cradle-to-gate evaluation. =Well-to-wheel= Well-to-wheel is the specific LCA used for transport fuels and vehicles. The analysis is often broken down into stages entitled \\"well-to- station\\", or \\"well-to-tank\\", and \\"station-to-wheel\\" or \\"tank-to-wheel\\", or \\"plug-to-wheel\\". The first stage, which incorporates the feedstock or fuel production and processing and fuel delivery or energy transmission, and is called the \\"upstream\\" stage, while the stage that deals with vehicle operation itself is sometimes called the \\"downstream\\" stage. The well-to-wheel analysis is commonly used to assess total energy consumption, or the energy conversion efficiency and emissions impact of marine vessels, aircraft and motor vehicles, including their carbon footprint, and the fuels used in each of these transport modes.

WtW analysis is useful for reflecting the different efficiencies and emissions of energy technologies and fuels at both the upstream and downstream stages, giving a more complete picture of real emissions. The well-to-wheel variant has a significant input on a model developed by the Argonne National Laboratory. The Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation (GREET) model was developed to evaluate the impacts of new fuels and vehicle technologies. The model evaluates the impacts of fuel use using a well-to-wheel evaluation while a traditional cradle-to-grave approach is used to determine the impacts from the vehicle itself. The model reports energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, and six additional pollutants: volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NOx), particulate matter with size smaller than 10 micrometre (PM10), particulate matter with size smaller than 2.5 micrometre (PM2.5), and sulfur oxides (SOx). Quantitative values of greenhouse gas emissions calculated with the WTW or with the LCA method can differ, since the LCA is considering more emission sources. In example, while assessing the GHG emissions of a battery electric vehicle in comparison with a conventional internal combustion engine vehicle, the WTW (accounting only the GHG for manufacturing the fuels) finds out that an electric vehicle can save the 50‚Äì60% of GHG, while an hybrid LCA-WTW method, considering also the GHG due to the manufacturing and the end of life of the battery gives GHG emission savings 10-13% lower, compared to the WTW. =Economic input‚Äìoutput life cycle assessment= Economic input‚Äìoutput LCA (EIOLCA) involves use of aggregate sector-level data on how much environmental impact can be attributed to each sector of the economy and how much each sector purchases from other sectors.Hendrickson, C. T., Lave, L. B., and Matthews, H. S. (2005). Environmental Life Cycle Assessment of Goods and Services: An Input‚ÄìOutput Approach, Resources for the Future Press . Such analysis can account for long chains (for example, building an automobile requires energy, but producing energy requires vehicles, and building those vehicles requires energy, etc.), which somewhat alleviates the scoping problem of process LCA; however, EIOLCA relies on sector-level averages that may or may not be representative of the specific subset of the sector relevant to a particular product and therefore is not suitable for evaluating the environmental impacts of products. Additionally the translation of economic quantities into environmental impacts is not validated. =Ecologically based LCA= While a conventional LCA uses many of the same approaches and strategies as an Eco-LCA, the latter considers a much broader range of ecological impacts. It was designed to provide a guide to wise management of human activities by understanding the direct and indirect impacts on ecological resources and surrounding ecosystems. Developed by Ohio State University Center for resilience, Eco-LCA is a methodology that quantitatively takes into account regulating and supporting services during the life cycle of economic goods and products. In this approach services are categorized in four main groups: supporting, regulating, provisioning and cultural services. = Exergy-based LCA = Exergy of a system is the maximum useful work possible during a process that brings the system into equilibrium with a heat reservoir. Wall clearly states the relation between exergy analysis and resource accounting. This intuition confirmed by DeWulf and Sciubba lead to Exergo-economic accounting and to methods specifically dedicated to LCA such as Exergetic material input per unit of service (EMIPS). The concept of material input per unit of service (MIPS) is quantified in terms of the second law of thermodynamics, allowing the calculation of both resource input and service output in exergy terms. This exergetic material input per unit of service (EMIPS) has been elaborated for transport technology. The service not only takes into account the total mass to be transported and the total distance, but also the mass per single transport and the delivery time. Life cycle energy analysis Life cycle energy analysis (LCEA) is an approach in which all energy inputs to a product are accounted for, not only direct energy inputs during manufacture, but also all energy inputs needed to produce components, materials and services needed for the manufacturing process. An earlier term for the approach was energy analysis. With LCEA, the total life cycle energy input is established. =Energy production= It is recognized that much energy is lost in the production of energy commodities themselves, such as nuclear energy, photovoltaic electricity or high-quality petroleum products. Net energy content is the energy content of the product minus energy input used during extraction and conversion, directly or indirectly. A controversial early result of LCEA claimed that manufacturing solar cells requires more energy than can be recovered in using the solar cell . The result was refuted.David MacKay Sustainable Energy 24 February 2010 p. 41 Currently, energy payback time of photovoltaic solar panels range from a few months to several years. Another new concept that flows from life cycle assessments is energy cannibalism. Energy cannibalism refers to an effect where rapid growth of an entire energy-intensive industry creates a need for energy that uses (or cannibalizes) the energy of existing power plants. Thus during rapid growth the industry as a whole produces no energy because new energy is used to fuel the embodied energy of future power plants. Work has been undertaken in the UK to determine the life cycle energy (alongside full LCA) impacts of a number of renewable technologies. =Energy recovery= If materials are incinerated during the disposal process, the energy released during burning can be harnessed and used for electricity production. This provides a low-impact energy source, especially when compared with coal and natural gasDamgaard, A, et al. Life-cycle-assessment of the historical development of air pollution control and energy recovery in waste incineration. Waste Management 30 (2010) 1244‚Äì1250. While incineration produces more greenhouse gas emissions than landfills, the waste plants are well-fitted with regulated pollution control equipment to minimize this negative impact. A recent study comparing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from landfills (without energy recovery) against incineration (with energy recovery) found incineration to be superior in all cases except for when landfill gas is recovered for electricity production.Liamsanguan, C., Gheewala, S.H., LCA: A decision support tool for environmental assessment of MSW management systems. Jour. of Environ. Mgmt. 87 (2009) 132‚Äì138. =Criticism= Energy efficiency is arguably only one consideration in deciding which alternative process to employ, and should not be elevated as the only criterion for determining environmental acceptability. For example, a simple energy analysis does not take into account the renewability of energy flows or the toxicity of waste products. Incorporating \\"dynamic LCAs\\", e.g., with regard to renewable energy technologies‚Äîwhich use sensitivity analyses to project future improvements in renewable systems and their share of the power grid‚Äîmay help mitigate this criticism. In recent years, the literature on life cycle assessment of energy technology has begun to reflect the interactions between the current electrical grid and future energy technology. Some papers have focused on energy life cycle,J.M. Pearce, \\"Optimizing Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Strategies to Suppress Energy Cannibalism\\" 2nd Climate Change Technology Conference Proceedings, p. 48, 2009 while others have focused on carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases. The essential critique given by these sources is that when considering energy technology, the growing nature of the power grid must be taken into consideration. If this is not done, a given class energy technology may emit more CO2 over its lifetime than it initially thought it would mitigate, with this most well documented in wind energy's case. A problem that energy analysis method cannot resolve is that different energy forms‚Äîheat, electricity, chemical energy etc.‚Äîhave different quality and value as a consequence of the two main laws of thermodynamics. According to the first law of thermodynamics, all energy inputs should be accounted with equal weight, whereas by the second law, diverse energy forms should be accounted for using different values. The conflict may be resolved in one of several ways: the value differences between the energy inputs might be ignored, a value ratio may be arbitrarily assigned (e.g., that an input joule of electricity is 2.6-times more valuable than a joule of heat or fuel), the analysis may be supplemented by economic/cost analysis, or exergy, a thermodynamic measure of the quality of energy, may be used as the metric for the LCA (instead of energy). Critiques Life cycle assessment is a powerful tool for analyzing commensurable aspects of quantifiable systems. Not every factor, however, can be reduced to a number and inserted into a model. Rigid system boundaries make accounting for changes in the system difficult. This is sometimes referred to as the boundary critique to systems thinking. The accuracy and availability of data can also contribute to inaccuracy. For instance, data from generic processes may be based on averages, unrepresentative sampling, or outdated results.Malin, Nadav, Life-cycle assessment for buildings: Seeking the Holy Grail. Building Green, 2010. Additionally, social implications of products are generally lacking in LCAs. Comparative life-cycle analysis is often used to determine a better process or product to use. However, because of aspects like differing system boundaries, different statistical information, different product uses, etc., these studies can easily be swayed in favor of one product or process over another in one study and the opposite in another study based on varying parameters and different available data.Linda Gaines and Frank Stodolsky Life-Cycle Analysis: Uses and Pitfalls. Argonne National Laboratory. Transportation Technology R&D; Center There are guidelines to help reduce such conflicts in results but the method still provides a lot of room for the researcher to decide what is important, how the product is typically manufactured, and how it is typically used.

Background Hughes-Fulford was born in Mineral Wells, Texas. She graduated from Mineral Wells High School, in 1962, then received her Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry and Biology from Tarleton State University in 1968, and her Ph.D. from Texas Woman's University in 1972. She is widowed and has one daughter named Tori. She is a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, American Society for Gravitational Science and Biology, American Society for Bone and Mineral Research, American Society for Cell Biology, American Society of Hematology and the Association of Space Explorers. Academic experience Hughes-Fulford entered college at the age of 16 and earned her B.Sc. degree in chemistry and biology from Tarleton State University in 1968. In 1968, Dr. Hughes-Fulford began her graduate work studying plasma chemistry at Texas Woman's University as a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellow from 1968 to 1971. She was an American Association of University Women Fellow from 1970 to 1971, and a MacArthur Foundation Fellow from 1971 to 1972. Upon completing her doctorate degree at TWU in 1972, Dr. Hughes-Fulford joined the faculty of Southwestern Medical School, University of Texas at Dallas as a postdoctoral fellow with Marvin D. Siperstein where her research focused on regulation of cholesterol metabolism. Dr. Hughes-Fulford has contributed over 120 papers and abstracts on bone and cancer growth regulation and on the effect of spaceflight on the immune system at the cell molecular and systems biology level. Since then, she was named the Federal Employee of the Year for the Western Region in 1985, International Zontian in 1992 and Marin County Woman of the Year in 1994. She was a major in the US Army Reserve Medical Corps until 1995. Selected as a payload specialist by NASA in January 1983, Hughes-Fulford flew in June 1991 aboard STS-40 Spacelab Life Sciences (SLS 1), the first Spacelab mission dedicated to biomedical studies. The SLS-1 mission flew over 3.2 million miles in 146 orbits and its crew completed over 18 experiments during a nine-day period, bringing back more medical data than any previous NASA flight. Mission duration was 218 hours, 14 minutes and 20 seconds, or 9 days, 2 hours, 14 minutes, and 20 seconds. Hughes-Fulford is a Professor at the University of California Medical Center at San Francisco where she continues her research. As the Director of the Hughes-Fulford Laboratory and Scientific Advisor to the Under Secretary of Veteran's Affairs, she studies the control of human prostate cancer growth with VA grants and the regulation of bone and lymphocyte activation with NASA grants. She was the Principal Investigator (PI) on a series of SpaceHab/Biorack experiments, which examined the regulation of osteoblast (bone cell) growth. These experiments flew on STS-76, in March 1996, STS-81 in January 1997, and STS-84 in May 1997. These studies examined the root causes of osteoporosis that occurs in astronauts during spaceflight. She found changes in anabolic signal transduction in microgravity. Later, in collaboration with Dr. Augusto Cogoli of Zurich, Switzerland, she examined changes in T-cell gene induction in spaceflight in a joint NASA/ESA International Space Station experiment that launched on the Soyuz TMA-9. The previous Leukin experiment with Dr. Cogoli was lost on the STS-107 mission. This study (Leukin) examines the mechanism of action causing the decrease in T-cell activation in microgravity, a medical problem that was first found in returning Apollo astronauts. Isolated T-cells will be activated in spaceflight on Biopack hardware; the altered activation will be examined by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) analysis of induced genes. Further studies of gene regulation and signal transduction in spaceflight were approved in January 2002 for Shuttle/ISS experiments examining protein kinase C (PKC) signal activation. She flew her most recent experiments to ISS on SpaceX in collaboration with the ISS International Laboratory, the European Space Agency and the National Institutes of Health. In those studies, she found one bases for changes in the immune system in spaceflight many of her publications are available at her lab website.

While this technique is rarely needed for solving ordinary chess problems, there is a whole subgenre of chess problems in which it is an important part; such problems are known as retros. Retros may ask, for example, for a mate in two, but the main puzzle is in explaining the history of the position. This may be important to determine, for example, if castling is disallowed or an en passant pawn capture is possible. Other problems may ask specific questions relating to the history of the position such as \\"is the bishop on c1 promoted?\\". This is essentially a matter of logical reasoning, with high appeal for puzzle enthusiasts. Sometimes it is necessary to determine if a particular position is legal, with \\"legal\\" meaning that it could be reached by a series of legal moves, no matter how bad. Another important branch of retrograde analysis problems is proof game problems. Example An example of a retrograde analysis problem is shown on the left. The solver must deduce White's last move. It is not immediately apparent how the white king could have moved, since every adjacent square puts White in a seemingly impossible double check; on further examination it becomes apparent that if the white king moved from f5, then Black could have delivered the double check by playing f4xg3, capturing the white pawn on g4 en passant. Therefore, on the previous move, white must have played pawn g2-g4. But what did Black move before that? The white king on f5 was under check by the bishop on h3 and there was a white pawn on g2. The only possibility is that Black moved a knight from g4 to e5 with discovered check. Therefore, White's last move was king on f5 takes knight on e5. (The entire sequence of moves is 1...Ng4-e5+ (possibly capturing something on e5) 2.g2-g4 f4xg3+ e.p. 3.Kf5xe5.) In this example the fact that Black can deliver mate in several different ways is irrelevant; likewise the fact that White could legally have captured the black queen by gxf3 on an earlier move is irrelevant. The solver is required only to deduce a legal sequence of moves which lead to the position, regardless of any considerations of chess strategy. Castling and en passant conventions In retrograde analysis problems, as well as in standard chess problems, castling is assumed to be legal unless it can be proved otherwise. An en passant capture, on the other hand, is permitted only if it can be proved that the last move was a double step of the pawn to be captured. These two conventions lead to features unique to retrograde analysis problems. =Partial retrograde analysis (PRA)= Some problems use a method called \\"partial retrograde analysis\\" (PRA). In these, the history of a position cannot be determined with certainty, but each of the alternative histories demands a different solution. In Article 16 of the Codex for Chess Composition, the PRA convention is formally defined as follows: > \\"Where the rights to castle and/or to capture en-passant are mutually > dependent, the solution consists of several mutually exclusive parts. All > possible combinations of move rights, taking into account the castling > convention and the en-passant convention, form these mutually exclusive > parts.\\" The problem to the left by W. Langstaff (from Chess Amateur 1922) is a relatively simple example; it is a mate in two. It is impossible to determine what move Black played last, but it is clear that he must have either moved the king or rook, or else played g7-g5 (g6-g5 is impossible, since the pawn would have been giving check). Therefore, either Black cannot castle, or White can capture on g6 en passant. It is impossible to determine exactly what Black's last move actually was, so the solution has two lines: :1.Ke6 and 2.Rd8# (if Black moved the king or rook) :1.hxg6 e.p. (threat: 2.Rd8#) 1...O-O 2.h7# (if Black played g7-g5) =The retro strategy convention (RS)= Sometimes it is possible to prove that only one of two castling moves is legal, but it is impossible to determine which one. In this case, whichever castling move is executed first is deemed to be legal. The Codex defines the retro strategy (RS) convention as follows: > \\"If in the case of mutual dependency of castling rights a solution is not > possible according to the PRA convention, then the Retro-Strategy (RS) > convention should be applied: whichever castling is executed first is deemed > to be permissible.\\"Castling and En-passant capture in the Codex 2009, > janko.at In the problem on the left, if the rook on f3 is a promoted piece, then it is possible to prove that Black cannot castle. White on the other hand can castle, since it cannot be proved that it is illegal. If the rook on f3 is not a promoted piece, then one of White's two rooks originally came from a1, in which case the white king has moved and White cannot castle; Black on the other hand can castle since it cannot be proved that it is illegal. Put another way, either White can castle, or Black can castle, but not both. If Black can castle, then the problem has no solution, so White must castle in order to prove that Black cannot castle. The solution is therefore 1.O-O (\\"preventing\\" Black from castling by proving that the rook on f3 is promoted) followed by 2.Rf8#. Note that if White were to play 1.Rhf1, Black would be permitted to castle, and there would be no mate. =The a posteriori (AP) convention= This is perhaps the most controversial of the retrograde analysis conventions; if it is employed, the problem is usually marked as \\"AP\\". Sometimes it is possible to prove that if castling is possible, then the previous move must have been a double step of a pawn, making an en passant capture legal. In this case, the en passant capture is made, then its legality is proved a posteriori; this is accomplished by castling. In some such problems, Black's defence consists of trying to prevent White from castling, rendering the initial en passant capture illegal. Nenad Petroviƒá composed several problems in this vein; the example given on the left was discussed extensively in Tim Krabb√©'s book Chess Curiosities. Black has made 6 captures; to account for his pawn formation, all 6 captures must have been made with pawns; the capturing pawns must have started on b7, c7, d7 and e7. White has made 4 captures; again all of these captures must have been made with pawns. 3 of these captures must have been made with the pawn on e6, which started on b2. Which of the pawns on f5 and f7 started on g2? Only one of these pawns made a capture; Black's original f-pawn has not made a capture and is still on the f-file, so the pawn on f7 cannot be the original f-pawn; it must have started on g2, and the pawn on f5 must have started on f2. The capture must have been made on f7, after Black played f7-f6 but before Black moved the g-pawn. The sequence was as follows: White's pawns advanced to f5 and g6; Black made a capture exf4; at some point Black played f7-f6; White made a capture gxf7; Black played g7-g5 (or g7-g6 and g6-g5). What was White's last move? If the king or rook moved, then White cannot castle. It has been established that the f5 pawn started on f2, so the only way White could have moved a pawn is if the last move was gxf7, to which Black has immediately replied ...g7-g5. If this is in fact the case, then White can play 1.fxg6 (en passant). It has thus been proved that if White can castle, then 1.fxg6 ep is legal. The solution as originally given was 1.fxg6 ep (intending to prove its legality a posteriori by castling) 1...Bc5 (preventing castling and threatening ...Bf2+, which would force a king move and delegitimize the en passant capture) 2.e3 fxe3 3.O-O (sacrificing a rook in order to legitimize the en passant capture; if 3.d4 Bb4+ forces a king move and prevents castling) ...e2+ 4.Kg2 exf1=Q+ 5.Kxf1 and White has a won position. This composition was highly controversial when first published, due in part to the \\"non-chess\\" motivations behind the moves 1...Bc5, 2.e3 and 3.O-O, and provoked heated debate in chess problemist circles. Amid the controversy, it was overlooked that the win is not clear in the final position, and in fact Black could have won with 3...exd2+! (instead of 3...e2+) 4.Kg2 e3.

Atholl is a special Mormaerdom, because a King of Atholl is reported from the Pictish period. The only other two Pictish kingdoms to be known from contemporary sources are Fortriu and Circinn. Indeed, the early 13th century document known to modern scholars as the de Situ Albanie repeats the claim that Atholl was an ancient Pictish kingdom. In the 11th century, the famous Cr√≠n√°n of Dunkeld may have performed the role of Mormaer. Royal connections continued with M√°el Muire, who was the son of King Donnchad I, and the younger brother of M√°el Coluim III mac Donnchada. Matad was perhaps the most famous of the Mormaers, fathering Harald Maddadsson, a notorious rebel of the Scottish King and perhaps the first Gael to rule Orkney as Earl of Orkney. The line of M√°el Muire and Cr√≠n√°n came to an end when Forbhlaith, the daughter of Mormaer Henry married David de Hastings. The latter marriage produced a daughter, Ada, who married into the Strathbogie family, a semi-Normanized Gaelic family with Fife origins.

He was a test cosmonaut of the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center (TsPK). Gidzenko has flown into space three times and has lived on board the Mir and the International Space Station. He has also conducted two career spacewalks. Although he retired on July 15, 2001, he continued his employment by a special contract until Soyuz TM-34 concluded. Since 2004 to May 2009, Gidzenko was the Director of the 3rd department within the TsPK. Since May 2009 he serves as the Deputy Chief of Cosmonaut Training Center TsPK.  Personal  Gidzenko was born on March 26, 1962, Elanets, Mykolaiv Oblast, Ukraine (then in the Soviet Union). Gidzenko is married to Olga Vladimirovna Shapovalova. They have two sons, Sergei, born in 1986 and Alexander, born in 1988. His father, Pavel Vasilyevich Gidzenko, and mother, Galina Mikhailovna Gidzenko, live in Berezovka-2, Odessa area. Gidzenko's hobbies include football, swimming, reading of literature, photography, and walks in forests. Education Gidzenko graduated from the Higher Military Pilot School in Kharkiv in 1983. Gidzenko graduated from the Moscow State University of Geodesy and Cartography (MIIGAiK) in 1994 specializing in geodesy and cartography. Experience Upon graduation from the pilot school in 1983, Gidzenko served as a pilot and as a senior pilot in the RAir Force units of the Odessa military district. He was a 3rd class military pilot. Gidzenko was trained to fly three types of aircraft and has logged a total flying time of 850 hours. He is also a parachute- landing training instructor and has made 170 jumps. Cosmonaut career Gidzenko on board the Zvezda Service Module of the ISS communicates with ground controllers. From December 1987 to June 1989, Gidzenko attended basic space training as a test cosmonaut candidate. Since September 1989 he attended advanced training as a test cosmonaut candidate. From March to October 1994 he trained for a space flight as a back-up crew commander (17th Primary Expedition/Euro-Mir-94 Program). From November 1994 to August 1995 he attended training for a space flight aboard the Soyuz TM transport vehicle/Mir orbital complex as the Expedition 20 Primary Crew Commander (Euro-Mir-95 Program). = Mir EO-20 (Euromir 95) = Yuri Gidzenko served aboard Mir as the commander of the long duration Mir EO-20 (Euromir 95) expedition from September 3, 1995 to February 29, 1996, and logged 179 days in space. One of the crewmembers on this mission was the ESA astronaut, Thomas Reiter. The Soyuz TM-22 carrying Gidzenko, cosmonaut Sergei Avdeyev and Reiter lifted off from the Baikonour cosmodrome on September 3, 1995 at 9:00 UTC. After a two-day autonomous flight the Soyuz spacecraft docked automatically with the Mir space station's -X docking port on September 5. The three member crew became the 20th Mir resident crew. During the first week after docking, Euromir 95 crew and the resident Mir EO-19 crew of cosmonauts Anatoly Solovyev and Nikolai Budarin conducted joint work. Gidzenko and his crewmembers used this time to get familiarize with the status of the onboard systems and experiments. The scientific objectives of Euromir 95 were to study effects of microgravity on the human body, to experiment with the development on new materials in a space environment, to capture samples of cosmic dust and man-made particles in low Earth orbit, and to test new space equipment. During the next months joint Russian-German research work were performed on board the Mir in the fields of life sciences (18 experiments), astrophysics (5 experiments), materials science (8 experiments) and technology (10 experiments). The crew also performed common work with the crew of STS-74. They cooperated in medical experiments and environmental investigations designed as part of International Space Station (ISS) Phase I research. During Euromir 95, an unmanned cargo spacecraft, Progress M-29 visited the Mir on October 10. Progress M-29 brought about 2.5 tons of fresh supplies and equipment for the Mir EO-20 crew. On October 17, 1995 Russian and ESA officials decided to add another 44 days to the originally planned 135 days of the mission duration. On December 20, Progress M-30 docked at the Kvant port of Mir. It delivered 2300 kg of fuel, crew supplies, and research and medical equipment for use on the extended Euromir 95 mission On February 29, 1996, Gidzenko returned to Earth on board the Soyuz TM-22 capsule which landed at 10:42 UTC, 105 km northeast of Arkalyk. = Expedition 1 = Yuri Gidzenko, Expedition 1 flight engineer aboard the Multipurpose Logistics Module (MPLM), Leonardo. From November 2000 to March 2001, Gidzenko was part of the first permanent ISS resident crew, the Expedition 1. He along with cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev and NASA astronaut William Shepherd was launched into space on board the Soyuz TM-31 spacecraft which lifted off from the Baikonour cosmodrome on October 31, 2000 at 07:52:47 UTC. Gidzenko served as the Soyuz commander. After two days of solo flight, on November 2, the Soyuz spacecraft docked with the aft port the Zvezda Service Module at 09:21 UTC. Gidzenko joined the Expedition 1 crew as a flight engineer. The crew were on board the ISS for over four months. They helped with assembly tasks as new elements, including the U.S. Destiny Laboratory, were added to the orbiting outpost. In their first weeks on board, Gidzenko, Shepherd and Krikalev activated critical life support systems and unpacked Station components, clothing, laptop computers, office equipment, cables and electrical gear left behind for them by previous Shuttle crews which conducted logistic supply flights to the new complex over the past two years. Expedition 1 crew hosted three visiting Shuttle crews, STS-97, STS-98 and STS-102. The crew unloaded two unmanned Russian Progress resupply vehicles. On March, 2001, Expedition 1 crewmembers returned to Earth aboard the at the completion of the STS-102. Discovery landed at the Kennedy Space Center's Runway 15, on March 21 at 02:33:06 EST. On board Soyuz/shuttle and ISS, Gidzenko logged 140 days in space. = Soyuz TM-34/Soyuz TM-33 = Soyuz 4 Taxi Commander Gidzenko enters the Zarya's pressurized adapter on the ISS. He was Launched on April 25, 2002 on the Soyuz TM-34 (Soyuz 4 Taxi Crew) mission along with ESA astronaut Roberto Vittori and South African Space Tourist Mark Shuttleworth. The Soyuz TM-34 lifted off from the Baikonour cosmodrome at 06:26:35 UTC. Gidzenko served as the Soyuz commander for the flight. After two days of solo flight, the Soyuz docked with the nadir port of the Zarya module at 07:55 UTC. Once there at the ISS, Gidzenko, Vittori and Shuttleworth conducted joint operations with the ISS resident Expedition 4 crew, performed educational and science activities and exchanged seat liners from the Soyuz TM-34 to the old Soyuz TM-33. On May 5, Gidzenko returned to Earth on board the Soyuz TM-33 spacecraft. Soyuz TM-33 undocked from the Pirs Docking Compartment and landed 26 km south east of Arkalyk at 03:51:53 UTC. On board Soyuz TM-33/TM-34 and the ISS, Gidzenko logged 9 days in space. = Spacewalks = Gidzenko has performed two career spacewalks during his stay on board the Mir space station. On December 8, 1995 Gizenko performed his first career spacewalk. He and cosmonaut Avedeyev began the spacewalk at 19:23 UTC. The two spacewalkers reconfigured the docking unit at the front of the Mir base block to prepare it for arrival of the Priroda module. From inside the depressurized docking unit, the two cosmonauts moved the Konus docking unit from the +Z to the -Z docking port, where the Priroda module was docked. The spacewalk lasted 37 minutes. On February 8, 1996 Gidzenko performed his second career spacewalk. He and ESA astronaut Thomas Reiter began the spacewalk at 14:03 UTC. At the beginning, they moved a maneuvering unit stored inside the Kvant 2 airlock and attached it to the exterior of the module. The spacewalkers then climbed out the Kvant 2 hatch and again used the Strela boom to maneuver to the forward end of Spektr, where they retrieved the two cassettes they had deployed in October, 1995. They installed a new cassette in the facility and, with Adeyev's assistance from inside the station, verified that it would operate. Although originally scheduled to last about 5 hours and 30 minutes, the spacewalking activity was shortened to 3 hours and 6 minutes by an aborted task on a Kristall antenna. The Russian officials canceled the antenna work when the cosmonauts were unable to loosen the bolts on a joint of the antenna.

He was also the official artist for the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. Life and work Terence Cuneo was born in London, the son of Cyrus Cincinato Cuneo (1879-1916) and Nell Marion Tenison (1881-1964), artists who met while studying with Whistler in Paris. Cyrus Cuneo's elder brother Rinaldo Cuneo was also an acclaimed painter in San Francisco, as was his youngest brother Egisto Cuneo. Terence Cuneo studied at Sutton Valence School in Kent, Chelsea Polytechnic and the Slade School of Art, before working as an illustrator for magazines, books and periodicals. In 1936 he started working in oils, continuing with his illustration work. During World War II he served as a sapper in the Royal Engineers but also completed a small number of commissions for the War Artists' Advisory Committee, providing illustrations of tank and aircraft factories. He served and became good friends with fellow artist Cyril Parfitt.Also during the War, Cuneo was commissioned by the Foreign Office to produce anti-Nazi drawings and cartoons and an exhibition of his war works was held at the Palaquin Fine Arts gallery in 1942. Cuneo's depiction of a Second World War invasion scene After the war, Cuneo was commissioned to produce a series of works illustrating railways, bridges and locomotives. A significant point in his career was his appointment as official artist for the Coronation of Elizabeth II, which brought his name before the public worldwide. He received more commissions from industry, which included depicting manufacturing, mineral extraction and road building, including the M1. He was most famous for his paintings of engineering subjects, particularly locomotives and the railway as a whole. But in fact Cuneo painted over a wide range, from big game in Africa to landscapes. Further success was achieved in his regimental commissions, battle scenes and incidents as well as portraits (including H.M. the Queen, and Field Marshal Montgomery). From 1954 his works included a small mouse, sometimes lifelike, sometimes cartoonish. These became his trademark after 1956.Antiques Roadshow Series 32; 15. Brooklands, broadcast 17 Jan 2009 They can be difficult to detect, and many people enjoy scouring his paintings to find one. Even some of his portraits of the famous contain a mouse. His work has been used in a variety of manners, from book jackets and model railway catalogues to posters and jigsaws and even Royal Mail postage stamps. His paintings have appeared on both Great Britain and Isle of Man stamps. His work can also be found in many museums, officers messes, and galleries, including Guildhall Art Gallery, Newarke Houses Museum, Lloyd's of London and the Royal Institution. Cuneo was awarded the OBE and was a CVO. A 1.5 times life size bronze memorial statue of Cuneo, by Philip Jackson, stood in the main concourse at Waterloo station in London for many years, but has now been relocated to Brompton Barracks, Chatham. It was commissioned by the Terence Cuneo Memorial Trust (established March 2002) to create a permanent memorial to the artist, together with an annual prize at the Slade School of Art, given by the Trust. In tribute to Cuneo's trademark, the statue includes a mouse peering from under a book by the artist's feet, and another carved into the statue's plinth near the ground. The official handover of the statue and its dowry to the Institution of Royal Engineers took place on 12 July 2017 with Carole Cuneo (representing the Statue Memorial Trust), Colonel Nigel Montagu (representing the Institution of Royal Engineers) and Chris Wheeler (Chairman of the Cuneo Society) each giving short speeches.

The phrase \\"two, six, heave\\" is relatively modern, variations not appearing in print until 1911 (as \\"wan [one] - two - six - pull\\")https://books.google.ca/books?id=XlFHAQAAMAAJ&focus;=searchwithinvolume&q;=blazers, and again in 1925 as \\"one, two... six - heave!\\".https://books.google.ca/books?id=KtyfAAAAMAAJ&focus;=searchwithinvolume&q;=six+heave. The phrase was not considered a specifically nautical or naval term until 1951 (appearing as \\"one, two, six, heave!\\").https://books.google.ca/books?id=slQuAQAAIAAJ&focus;=searchwithinvolume&q;=+two+six+ The exact phrase \\"two... six... heave\\" without the leading \\"one\\" first appeared in 1952, referring to its use in railway construction in Sumatran prisoner-of-war camps in 1942. https://books.google.ca/books?id=TlBNAQAAIAAJ&focus;=searchwithinvolume&q;=heave The year 1968 marked the first use of the exact phrase \\"two, six - heave\\" as a nautical or naval term.https://books.google.ca/books?id=Gk0pAQAAIAAJ&focus;=searchwithinvolume&q;=heave Remarkably, the subject of the 1968 article was a number of theories about the origin of \\"two, six, heave\\". It also contains the first appearance of the popular unconfirmed theory that the phrase originated from Royal Navy gunners numbered 2 and 6, who supposedly, on this command, hauled the gun back for reloading. More familiar numeric ordering, \\"one, two, three, heave\\", has been in continuous use since as early as 1836.https://books.google.ca/books?id=fylhAAAAcAAJ&pg;=PA196 A variation from The Lost Ship, 1840, is described thus: \\" ‚ÄúSteady lads, steady...wait till I give you the words ‚Äî one, two, three, and then at the third, pull all together... Now then - one, two, three - pull\\" \\".https://books.google.ca/books?id=HncyAQAAMAAJ&focus;=searchwithinvolume&q;=steady It is widely believed to derive from the orders used in firing shipboard cannons in the British Royal Navy. The team of six men had numbered roles. After loading, it was the task of the men numbered two and six to heave (in a coordinated fashion) the cannon out the gunport for firing, using simple effort for a light cannon or a tackle apiece for larger ones. There are a number of problems with this source (i) Two men would be insufficient to haul out a gun, which could weigh in excess of two and a half tons (ii) numbers two and six would be on the same side of the gun (even numbers being on one side and odd numbers on the other) (iii) there is no reference to the phrase in any literature prior to the first world war, making it highly unlikely that it was in use before this time. In Britain it has a broader meaning and is often used in any situation where a coordinated pulling effort is required, often where maritime people are involved, but almost as frequently where 'civilians' are working together. As used by sailors, the person at the front of the team will typically call out the \\"two, six\\" part of the chant. During this phase all members move their hands up the line ready to pull. This is followed, in its natural rhythm, by the \\"heave\\", called out by the whole team together. At this moment, the team simultaneously lean back on the line, and use their leg muscles to exert a powerful pull upon it. This coordination takes some practice to achieve, but the difference in applied power between a raw group pulling as individuals and a practiced team hauling together is very significant. There is not a single tempo or cadence for the chant, since this will depend on the task in hand. For example, hauling in the upper topsail halyard will require a long, heavy pull; if the team is not to be exhausted halfway through then the leader must ensure that the pace is slow enough to be maintained throughout the job. Hauling in a clewline, by contrast, is relatively quick and easy, so the chant can be quite rapid. It is also not always necessary to use this method of hauling for the whole of a task; often, the first part of the job can be achieved with simple hand-over-hand pulling, switching over to a coordinated heave for the final tensioning. After a line on a ship has been hauled taut, it will usually be secured to a belaying pin. People in the square rigged sailing community have proposed the idea that it could be a shortening of the French ‚Äútout de suite‚Äù, often anglicised colloquially to \\"toot sweet\\", which means 'immediately'. There's also been conjecture that it was originally the French, \\"toutes six houle\\" (all six heave) but what \\"six\\" is unclear as there's no evidence it was orders to a gun crew.

He was a member of the powerful House of Bell√™me. Robert became notorious for his alleged cruelty. The chronicler Orderic Vitalis calls him \\"Grasping and cruel, an implacable persecutor of the Church of God and the poor ... unequalled for his iniquity in the whole Christian era.\\" The stories of his brutality may have inspired the legend of Robert the Devil. Early life Robert was the oldest surviving son of Roger of Montgomery, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury and Mabel de Bell√™me, born probably between 1052 and 1056.George Edward Cokayne, The Complete Peerage; or, a History of the House of Lords and all its Members from the Earliest Times, Vol XI, ed. Geoffrey H. White (London: The St. Catherine Press, Ltd., 1949), p. 689 In 1070 after the death of his great-uncle Yves Bishop of S√©es his parents brought him to Bell√™me, which at that time became his mother's inheritance, and as the oldest surviving son it would eventually be his.His older brother Roger died young, before 1060‚Äì62 when Robert attested a charter for St. Aubin of Angers. See: Cokayne, The Complete Peerage, Vol XI (1949), p. 690 & note (b). This placed Robert in line to obtain his parents' inheritances in Normandy, where the law distinguished between acquisitions and inheritances. Acquisitions were those lands obtained by conquest or purchase while a parent's (typically father's) Norman ancestral lands were heritable by the eldest son. This was later codified in the Leges Henrici Primi which stated: \\"The Ancestral fee of the father is to go to the first-born son; but he may give his purchases or later acquisitions to whomsoever he prefers\\". For a time after the Conquest this took the form of the eldest son, now Robert, inheriting the Norman lands of his ancestors while the second son, Hugh, was given the English honors his father had acquired.

Geoffrey H. White (London: The St. Catherine Press, Ltd., 1949), p. 690 In 1073 when the Conqueror invaded Maine, Robert was knighted by William at the siege of Fresnai castle.Ordericus Vitalis, The Ecclesiastical History of England and Normandy, Vol. II, trans. Thomas Forester (London: Henry G. Bohn, 1854), p. 75 By now probably of age and independent of his father he took part in the 1077 revolt of the young Robert Curthose against Duke William.Robert de Bell√™me was typical of his generation, the sons of William's companions who had earned their great honors and titles at the battle of Hastings in 1066. This newer generation did not share the values and attitudes of their fathers but rather had different experiences altogether. They had inherited their wealth and status, not earned it. Yet this next generation expected royal favor and patronage without attending court or serving the king in any capacity. They often rebelled when they felt they were not being treated with the dignity and respect they deserved. See: Charlotte A. Newman, The Anglo-Norman Nobility in the Reign of Henry I, The Second Generation (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1988), pp. 17‚Äì18; also: William M. Aird, Robert \`Curthose', Duke of Normandy (C. 1050‚Äì1134) (Woodbridge: Boydell Press, 2011), pp. 69‚Äì70, 83. When Robert's mother, Mabel, was killed , Robert inherited her vast estates.J. F. A. Mason, 'Roger de Montgomery and His Sons (1067‚Äì1102)', Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, 5th series vol. 13 (1963) p. 13 But at this point Duke William took the added precaution of garrisoning the Bell√™me castles with his own soldiers, which was his ducal right.C. Warren Hollister, Henry I (New Haven; London: Yale University Press, 2003), p. 65 On hearing the news of William the Conqueror's death in 1087, Robert's first act was to expel the ducal garrisons from all his castles. Rebellion of 1088 At the end of 1087 Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy was told of a plot to place him on the throne of England in his brother William II's place, a plot that Duke Robert enthusiastically approved and supported.William M. Aird, Robert 'Curthose', Duke of Normandy (C. 1050‚Äì1134) (Woodbridge: The Boydell Press, 2008), p. 110 Robert de Bell√™me, his brother Hugh de Montgomery and a third brother, either Roger or Arnulf, participated in this rebellion.Victoria Chandler, 'The Last of the Montgomerys: Roger the Poitevin and Arnulf', Historical Research, Vol. 62, No. 147 (February 1989), p. 3 & n. 7 The main conspirators, however, were Odo of Bayeux, Eustace III, Count of Boulogne, Robert de Mowbray, Geoffrey de Montbray, Earl Roger de Montgomery and other disaffected Magnates. The next year in the Rebellion of 1088, beginning at Easter the rebels burned and wasted the king's properties and those of his followers.The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, trans. James Ingram (Middlesex: Echo Library, 2007), p. 137 At some point Roger of Montgomery detached himself from supporting Robert Curthose through negotiations with the king.Neil Strevett, 'The Antlo-Norman Civil War of 1101 Reconsidered', Anglo-Norman Studies, XXVL, Proceedings of the Battle Conference 2003, ed. John Gillingham (Woodbridge: The Boydell Press, 2004), p. 160 Finally Robert de Bell√™me was among the rebels who found themselves defending Rochester Castle.Frank Barlow, William Rufus (Berkeley; Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1983), p. 81 When William Rufus blockaded the town and built two counter-castles, the garrison began negotiating for surrender under honourable terms, being allowed to keep their lands and serve the king. This Rufus refused; he was furious and had initially wanted the traitors hanged 'or by some other form of execution utterly removed from the face of the earth.'Karen Bosnos, 'Treason and Pilitics in Anglo-Norman Histories', Feud, Violence and Practice: Essays in Medieval Studies in Honor of Stephen D. White ed. Belle S. Tuten (Burlington, VT; Farnham, Surrey: Ashgate Publishing, 2010), p. 299 Roger of Montgomery and other great barons interceded with the King, Earl Roger on behalf of his sons, until finally in July a semi-honorable surrender was negotiated between the king and the rebels. Rufus, albeit reluctantly, guaranteed the rebels life and limb and gave them safe conduct.William M. Aird, Robert 'Curthose', Duke of Normandy (C. 1050‚Äì1134) (Woodbridge: The Boydell Press, 2008), p. 115 Return to Normandy Coincidentally Robert sailed back to Normandy in the company of Count Henry (later king Henry I), who had not been part of the conspiracy against his brother William Rufus.C. Warren Hollister, Henry I ( New Haven; London: Yale University Press, 2003), pp. 62‚Äì3 However well they got along on the voyage, they were destined to become bitter enemies. One thing more they shared in common was the extreme resentment by Odo, Bishop of Bayeux who, banished from England, had returned to Normandy ahead of Henry and Robert. Henry at just 20 years of age was now Odo's overlord, which Odo strongly resented, and Robert de Bell√™me was a powerful and dangerous disruptive force in Normandy now free to do as he would. Odo, who held great sway over Duke Robert, convinced him that both Henry and his travel companion Robert de Bell√™me were now conspiring with William Rufus against the duke. Both Henry and Robert were seized as they disembarked and, both placed in the Bishop's custody, were imprisoned; Henry at Bayeux and Robert at Neuilly-ll'Ev√™que, now Neuilly-la-For√™t. On hearing his son was imprisoned Roger de Montgomery, Earl of Shrewsbury immediately went to Normandy and put all his castles in a state of readiness against the duke.Ordericus Vitalis, The Ecclesiastical History of England and Normandy, Vol. II, trans. Thomas Forester (London: Henry G. Bohn, 1854), p. 452 At this point the Montgomery family was in a state of rebellion against Robert Curthose.Kathleen Thompson, 'Robert of Bell√™me Reconsidered', Anglo-Norman Studies XIII; Proceedings of the Battle Conference 1990, ed. Marjorie Chibnall (Woodbridge: The Boydell Press, 1991), p. 270 Bishop Odo now instigated Duke Robert to take all the castles of Robert de Bell√™me by force and the duke gathered an army and proceeded against them. Duke Robert first attacked Ballon and after losses on both sides, the castle surrendered.Ordericus Vitalis, The Ecclesiastical History of England and Normandy, Vol. II, trans. Thomas Forester (London: Henry G. Bohn, 1854), p. 455 Moving on to the castle of Saint-C√©neri where the family of Robert de Bell√™me was residing, Robert Quarrel had been told by Earl Roger to resist the duke at all costs and this was done until the provisions eventually failed.Ordericus Vitalis, The Ecclesiastical History of England and Normandy, Vol. II, trans. Thomas Forester (London: Henry G. Bohn, 1854), p. 456 Duke Robert was so enraged at such resistance he blinded Robert Quarrel and mutilated the castle defenders. At this point the duke lost interest in attempting to capture any more of Robert de Bell√™me's castles, he dissolved the forces and returned to Rouen. Earl Roger sent peace envoys to the duke and convinced him to release his son Robert which the fickle duke finally did.Ordericus Vitalis, The Ecclesiastical History of England and Normandy, Vol. II, trans. Thomas Forester (London: Henry G. Bohn, 1854), p. 457 The price of his son's release, however, was the castle of Saint-C√©neri which Duke Robert gave to Robert Giroie as castellan. The Giroies had long held the castle until, as punishment for their rebellion in the 1060s, William the Conqueror gave this castle and other Giroie lands to Roger de Montgomery, who as a member of the Bell√™me family was also considered their nemesis. By 1090 Robert was back in Robert Curthose's good graces, Orderic Vitalis calling him a \\"principal councilor\\" to duke Robert.Ordericus Vitalis, The Ecclesiastical History of England and Normandy, Vol. II, trans. Thomas Forester (London: Henry G. Bohn, 1854), p. 476 He supported Curthose in putting down a revolt by the citizens of Rouen, in 1090,J. F. A.

Thomas Forester (London: Henry G. Bohn, 1854), pp. 502‚Äì3 According to Robert of Torigni in 1092 the inhabitants of Domfront, long a Bell√™me-Montgomery stronghold, invited Henry, the duke's younger brother to take possession of Domfront.C. Warren Hollister, Henry I (New Haven; London: Yale University Press, 2003), pp. 86‚Äì7 & n. 250 Apparently they had grown weary of Robert's oppressive and abusive style of lordship. No explanation was offered for what happened to Robert de Bell√™me's garrison contingent or who exactly facilitated the bloodless takeover. In addition Robert de Bell√™me had requested that same year to hold Bell√™me of the French crown instead of the Duke of Normandy. In 1094 Robert's father, earl Roger, died.Detlev Schwennicke, Europ√§ische Stammtafeln: Stammtafeln zur Geschichte der Europ√§ischen Staaten, Neue Folge, Band III Teilband 4 (Marburg, Germany: J. A. Stargardt, 1989), Tafel 637 Robert's younger brother Hugh of Montgomery, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury inherited the English lands and titles, while Robert inherited his father's Norman properties, which included good part of central and southern Normandy, in part adjacent to the Bell√™me territories he had already inherited from his mother.George Edward Cokayne, The Complete Peerage; or, a History of the House of Lords and all its Members from the Earliest Times, Vol XI, ed.

Robert Bell√™me regained the favour of Rufus and both he and his brothers were in his service on several occasions. In 1098 he captured Elias I, Count of Maine for Rufus, a significant feat.J. F. A. Mason, 'Roger de Montgomery and His Sons (1067‚Äì1102)', Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, 5th series vol. 13 (1963) p. 20 In 1098 Robert's younger brother Hugh died, and Robert inherited, on payment of ¬£3,000 in relief, the English properties that had been their father's, including the Rape of Arundel and the Earldom of Shrewsbury.C. Warren Hollister, Henry I (New Haven & London: Yale University Press, 2003), p. 155 Robert had also acquired the countship of Ponthieu jure uxoris and the honour of Tickhill; all of which combined made him the wealthiest magnate in both England and Normandy. In August 1100 at the death of Rufus, Henry I seized the English throne before his brother Robert Curthose could claim it.Neil Strevett, 'The Antlo-Norman Civil War of 1101 Reconsidered', Anglo-Norman Studies, XXVL. Proceedings of the Battle Conference 2003, ed. John Gillingham (Woodbridge: The Boydell Press, 2004), p. 161 While Robert rushed to England to pay homage to Henry, he and his brothers must have seen this as the end of royal favour for the Montgomery's.J. F. A. Mason, 'Roger de Montgomery and His Sons (1067‚Äì1102)', Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, 5th series vol. 13 (1963) pp. 20‚Äì21 Anglo-Norman Civil War 1101 Duke Robert returned from the First Crusade in triumph.Steven Runciman, The First Crusade (Cambridge; New York: Cambridge University Press, 2000), p. 190 According to Orderic, Curthose was being encouraged to attack Henry by his barons but he remained indecisive until Ranulf Flambard, having escaped from the Tower of London, fled to Normandy where he appears to have influenced Duke Robert to go ahead with his invasion of England and depose his brother Henry.David Crouch, The Normans; The History of a Dynasty (London; New York: Hambledon Continuum, 2007), p. 170 Robert de Bell√™me was one of the great magnates who joined Robert Curthose's 1101 invasion of England, along with his brothers Roger the Poitevin and Arnulf of Montgomery and his nephew William, Count of Mortain.C. Warren Hollister, 'The Anglo-Norman Civil War: 1101', The English Historical Review, Vol. 88, No. 347 (Apr. 1973), pp. 317‚Äì8 This invasion, however, which aimed to depose Henry I, ended bloodlessly in the Treaty of Alton which called for amnesty for the participants but allowed traitors to be punished.C. Warren Hollister, 'The Anglo-Norman Civil War: 1101', The English Historical Review, Vol. 88, No. 347 (Apr. 1973), pp. 331, It quickly became evident that Henry I had no intentions of abiding by the treaty of Alton; 'Soothe them with promises' advised Robert Count of Meulan just before the battle, then they can be 'driven into exile'.C. Warren Hollister, 'The Anglo-Norman Civil War: 1101', The English Historical Review, Vol. 88, No. 347 (Apr. 1973), pp. 332, Henry I took a year compiling charges against Robert and his brothers and Robert's unlicensed castle building and specifically Bridgnorth Castle may have been the last straw for Henry.J. F. A. Mason, 'Roger de Montgomery and His Sons (1067‚Äì1102)', Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, 5th series vol. 13 (1963) p. 22 Henry had a series of charges drawn up against Robert in 1102, and when Robert refused to answer for them, gathered his forces and besieged and captured Robert's English castles.David Crouch, The Normans; The History of a Dynasty (London; New York: Hambledon Continuum, 2007), p. 175 Robert lost his English lands and titles (as did his brothers), was banished from England, and returned to Normandy.George Edward Cokayne, The Complete Peerage; or, a History of the House of Lords and all its Members from the Earliest Times, Vol XI, ed. Geoffrey H. White (London: The St. Catherine Press, Ltd., 1949), p. 693 In 1105 he was warring with Rotrou III, Count of Perche over a large portion of his Bell√™me lands and lost. That same year he attacked a force of Henry's supporters, then went to England before Christmas to attempt make peace with King Henry but he returned to Normandy empty handed. Battle of Tinchebrai and after In 1106 Robert was one of Curthose's commanders at the Battle of Tinchebrai commanding the rear division and, when the battle turned in Henry's favour, he and most of those with him avoided capture by fleeing the field. With Normandy now under Henry's rule, Robert de Bell√™me submitted and was allowed to retain his Norman fiefs and his office as viscount of the Hi√©mois.Kathleen Thompson, 'Robert of Bell√™me Reconsidered', Anglo-Norman Studies XIII; Proceedings of the Battle Conference 1990, Ed. Marjorie Chibnall (The Boydell Press, Woodbridge, 1991), p. 277 But Henry was still wary of Robert and placed his followers in key positions in Normandy.Kathleen Thompson, 'Robert of Bell√™me Reconsidered', Anglo-Norman Studies XIII; Proceedings of the Battle Conference 1990, Ed. Marjorie Chibnall (The Boydell Press, Woodbridge, 1991), p. 278 In the rebellion of 1110‚Äì12 barons on the frontier of Normandy were disgruntled over Henry's policies and especially his attempt to take custody of William Clito, son of Robert Curthose. According to Orderic, Robert played a central role in this rebellion after the death of Elias I, Count of Maine in July 1110. In 1112 Robert was sent as an envoy of the French king to Henry I at his court at Bonneville to negotiate the release of Robert Curthose, whereas Henry seized Robert and imprisoned him.Kathleen Thompson, 'Orderic Vitalis and Robert of Bell√™me', Journal of Medieval History, Vol. 20 (1994), p. 138 Apparently Henry had charges already prepared; failing to attend Henry at his court after being summoned three times, of failing to render accounts, and of acting against his lord's interests.Judith A. Green, Henry I: King of England and Duke of Normandy (Cambridge University Press, New York, 2006), p. 125 Technically Robert may have been guilty but arguably it was not safe for him to attend Henry, he may have regarded the revenues as gifts and it is also arguable whether the charge of acting against Henry's interests warranted the severity of the punishment. In addition Robert was under the king's protection as an emissary sent to negotiate Robert Curthose's release.C.W, Hollister, 'War and diplomacy in the Anglo-norman world; The reign of Henry I', Anglo-Norman Studies VI: Proceedings of the Battle Conference 1983, Ed. R. Allen Brown (The Boydell Press, Woodbridge, 1984), p. 81. This gave the act international implications but at the time Louis VI of France and Henry I were intriguing against each other so the breach of protocol went unpunished. But with Robert's imprisonment the rebellion against Henry collapsed. Robert spent the rest of his life as a prisoner; the exact date of his death is not known.J. F. A. Mason, 'Roger de Montgomery and His Sons (1067‚Äì1102)', Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, 5th series vol. 13 (1963) p. 24 Historical portrayal  Orderic Vitalis portrays Robert de Bell√™me as a villain, especially when compared to Henry I, whose misdemeanours the chronicler felt were excusable. Orderic calls Robert \\"Grasping and cruel, an implacable persecutor of the Church of God and the poor... unequalled for his iniquity in the whole Christian era.\\" To quote David C. Douglas \\"Ordericus, if credulous, was neither malicious nor a liar; and these accounts concerned people of whom he had special knowledge\\" [referring to the Bell√™me-Montgomery family]. But, he may have been strongly biased against Robert de Bell√™me and his treatment of that magnate belies a moral interpretation of his actions. The basis for Orderic's animosity towards Robert and his de Bell√™me predecessors was the longstanding and bitter feud between the Giroie family, patrons of Orderic's Abbey of Saint-Evroul, and the de Bell√™me family.William Talvas (de Bell√™me), Robert's grandfather, had blinded and mutilated William fitz Giroie (for more on the feud between the Bell√™mes and the Giroies see the article William I Talvas). He did at times appropriate church properties and was not a major donor to any ecclesiastical house. But Robert's attitudes toward the church are typical of many of his contemporaries; certainly no worse than the secular rulers and other magnates of his day. The assessment of William II Rufus by R.W. Southern could well apply to Robert de Bell√™me as well: \\"His life was given over to military designs, and to the raising of money to make them possible; for everything that did not minister to those ends he showed a supreme contempt\\". According to William Hunt in the Dictionary of National Biography, various stories of his brutality were circulated after his death, possibly inspiring the legend of Robert the Devil, a sadistically cruel Norman knight fathered by Satan himself. In Maine \\"his abiding works are pointed to as the works of Robert the Devil, a surname that has been transferred from him to the father of the Conqueror.\\" Family and children Robert married Agnes of Ponthieu, before 9 Sep 1087, and they had one child:George Edward Cokayne, The Complete Peerage; or, A History of the House of Lords and all its Members from the Earliest Times, Vol XI, Ed. Geoffrey H. White (London: The St. Catherine Press, Ltd., 1949), p. 695 * William III of Ponthieu, who via his mother inherited the county of Ponthieu. Fictional references Robert appears as the principal antagonist throughout George Shipway's The Palladin (1973), a fictionalized account of the life of Walter Tirel. Robert appears as the primary antagonist \\"Robert of Belesme\\" in the period romance novels Lady of Fire (1987) and Fire and Steel (1988) by Anita Mills, which take place during the rise of Henry I of England and the events during and after the Battle of Tinchebray, respectively.

In 2002, Shuttleworth became the first South African to travel to space as a space tourist, and indeed the first African from an independent country to travel to space. He lives on the Isle of Man and holds dual citizenship from South Africa and the United Kingdom. According to the Sunday Times Rich List in 2020, Shuttleworth is worth an estimated ¬£500 million. Early life Born in Welkom in South Africa's Orange Free State to a surgeon and a nursery-school teacher, Shuttleworth attended school at Western Province Preparatory School (where he eventually became Head Boy in 1986), followed by one term at Rondebosch Boys' High School, and then at Bishops/Diocesan College, where he was Head Boy in 1991. Shuttleworth obtained a Bachelor of Business Science degree in Finance and Information Systems at the University of Cape Town, where he lived in Smuts Hall. As a student, he became involved in the installation of the first residential Internet connections at the university. Work In 1995, Shuttleworth founded Thawte Consulting, a company which specialized in digital certificates and Internet security. In December 1999, Shuttleworth sold Thawte to VeriSign, earning Shuttleworth R3.5 billion ( million, equivalent to $ million in ). In September 2000, Shuttleworth formed HBD Venture Capital (Here be Dragons), a business incubator and venture capital provider now managed by Knife Capital. In March 2004 he formed Canonical Ltd., for the promotion and commercial support of free software projects, especially the Ubuntu operating system. In December 2009, Shuttleworth stepped down as the CEO of Canonical Ltd, Jane Silber took Canonical CEO position. Shuttleworth resumed the position of CEO of Canonical in July 2017 at the end of Silber's tenure. Linux and FOSS In the 1990s, Shuttleworth participated as one of the developers of the Debian operating system. In 2001, he formed the Shuttleworth Foundation, a nonprofit organisation dedicated to social innovation which also funds educational, free, and open source software projects in South Africa, such as the Freedom Toaster. In 2004, he returned to the free software world by funding the development of Ubuntu, a Linux distribution based on Debian, through his company Canonical Ltd. In 2005, he founded the Ubuntu Foundation and made an initial investment of 10 million dollars. In the Ubuntu project, Shuttleworth is often referred to with the tongue-in-cheek title \\"Self-Appointed Benevolent Dictator for Life\\" (SABDFL). To come up with a list of names of people to hire for the project, Shuttleworth took six months of Debian mailing list archives with him while travelling to Antarctica aboard the icebreaker Kapitan Khlebnikov in early 2004.Linux Format, Jeff Waugh (LXF 87). In September 2005, he purchased a 65% stake of Impi Linux. On 15 October 2006, it was announced that Mark Shuttleworth became the first patron of KDE, the highest level of sponsorship available. This relationship ended in 2012, together with financial support for Kubuntu, the Ubuntu variant with KDE as main desktop. On 17 December 2009, Mark announced that, effective March 2010, he would step down as CEO of Canonical to focus energy on product design, partnership, and customers. Jane Silber, COO at Canonical since 2004, took on the job of CEO at Canonical. In September 2010, he received an honorary degree from the Open University for this work. On 9 November 2012, Shuttleworth and Kenneth Rogoff took part in a debate opposite Garry Kasparov and Peter Thiel at the Oxford Union, entitled \\"The Innovation Enigma\\". On 25 October 2013, Shuttleworth and Ubuntu were awarded the Austrian anti-privacy Big Brother Award for sending local Ubuntu Unity Dash searches to Canonical servers by default. A year earlier, in 2012, Shuttleworth had defended the anonymisation method used. He later reversed the decision, and no current Ubuntu version does this. Spaceflight Shuttleworth on board the International Space Station Shuttleworth gained worldwide fame on 25 April 2002, as the second self-funded space tourist and the first-ever South African in space.Shuttleworth is the first citizen of an independent African country to go into space. Patrick Baudry, an earlier astronaut, was also born in Africa; however, since Baudry's native Cameroon was a French colony at the time of his birth, he is considered a French citizen. Shuttleworth also had British citizenship at the time of his flight. Flying through Space Adventures, he launched aboard the Russian Soyuz TM-34 mission as a spaceflight participant, paying approximately for the voyage. Two days later, the Soyuz spacecraft arrived at the International Space Station, where he spent eight days participating in experiments related to AIDS and genome research. On 5 May 2002, he returned to Earth on Soyuz TM-33. In order to participate in the flight, Shuttleworth had to undergo one year of training and preparation, including seven months spent in Star City, Russia. When he was in space, he spoke to Thabo Mbeki, then president of South Africa, on video link as part of the Freedom Day celebrations to mark the end of apartheid. While in space he also had a radio conversation with Nelson Mandela and a 14-year-old South African girl, Michelle Foster, who asked him to marry her. He politely dodged the question, stating that he was \\"very honoured at the question\\" before changing the subject.Space.com, Nelson Mandela Chats with Shuttleworth, 2 May 2002.

Legal clash with the South African Reserve Bank Upon moving R2.5 billion in capital from South Africa to the Isle of Man, the South African Reserve Bank imposed a R250 million levy in order to release his assets. Shuttleworth appealed and, after a lengthy legal battle, on 18 June 2015 the Constitutional Court of South Africa reversed and set aside the findings of the lower courts, ruling that the dominant purpose of an exit charge was to regulate conduct rather than to raise revenue.

The park is the site of a water- powered grist mill that was built in 1846 is one of only two water-driven mills remaining west of the Mississippi River. History The mill was established in 1846 by Dr. Edward Turner Bale on property in Rancho Carne Humana land grant. Bale lived near the site until his death in 1849. The gristmill and granary were built with local materials, Douglas firs and coast redwoods. Some timbers were cut to length with the bark left on, while others were roughed out with hand tools. The timbers were notched and held in place with wooden pegs as well as nails and screws. The foundation of the structure is native stone. The mill was powered by a waterwheel, with water diverted from Mill Creek nearby. A ditch carried the water from a millpond to a wooden flume, which brought the water to the top of the waterwheel. The first wheel did not provide enough power during dry summers and was replaced by a larger one, similar to the one at the mill today. The mill was once the center of social activity as Napa Valley settlers gathered to have their corn and wheat ground into meal or flour. Farmers brought grain to the mill where it was placed into the boot of an elevator to be mechanically transported upstairs where it was cleaned by various types of equipment. The slow turning of the old grind stones and the dampness of the mill's site gave the meal a special quality for making cornbread, yellowbread, shortening bread and spoonbread. As old timers put it, \\"When meal comes to you that way, like the heated underside of a settin' hen, it bakes bread that makes city bread taste like cardboard.\\" Theodore Benedict Lyman bought the mill and surrounding land in 1871 and passed ownership on to his son, William Whittingham Lyman. The mill remained in operation until 1879. Restoration After William Lyman's death, it appears his wife, the former Mrs. Sarah A. Nowland deeded the property to Native Sons of the Golden West, and through them the mill was restored during a period in the late 1960s and early 1970s through efforts of the Native Son Parlors of Napa County, under the leadership of past Grand President Bismarck Bruck, a grandson of Dr. Bale. The mill and its 36-foot water wheel are protected as a state historic landmark and have been partially restored. A trail connects the historic park to Bothe-Napa Valley State Park. Additionally, the park includes the site of the first church in the Napa Valley as well as the Pioneer Cemetery. Visitors can hike from the mill on the historic trail to Bothe-Napa Valley State Park, which features extensive picnic facilities and a number of trails. The round trip hike from Bale Grist Mill State Historic Park to Bothe-Napa Valley State Park is approximately two miles. In 2011 during the California budget crisis, the mill and adjacent park were among those targeted to be closed due to lack of funding. The Napa Valley State Park Association petitioned the state to operate the park in order to avoid closure. Milling demonstrations and tours of the historic mill are offered on weekends. Legislation was passed in 2014 to allow sale of flour produced at the mill to the public starting January 1, 2016 in order to help defray maintenance costs and preserve the mill.

He had already been created Baron Paston and Viscount Yarmouth in the Peerage of England in 1673. He was the son of William Paston, who had been created a Baronet, of Oxnead in the County of Norfolk, in the Baronetage of England in 1641. Lord Yarmouth was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He notably served as Treasurer of the Household between 1687 and 1689. He had no surviving male issue and the titles became extinct on his death in 1732. The second creation came in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1740 in favour of Amalie von Wallmoden, mistress of George II. She was made Baroness Yarmouth at the same time, also in the Peerage of England. The titles were for life only. Lady Yarmouth was the last Royal mistress to be awarded a peerage. She died in 1765. The third creation came in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1793 in favour of Francis Seymour-Conway, 1st Earl of Hertford. He was made Marquess of Hertford at the same time.

He is best remembered as the predominant commentator on ITV's coverage of British professional wrestling from 1955-1988. Early life  Despite a transatlantic accent which led many to believe he was Canadian, he was born in Cairo, Egypt, the son of the finance minister in the colonial government. He grew up at Haslemere in Surrey and was educated at Charterhouse. He attended the Embassy School of Acting in London and appeared in rep. On the outbreak of war in 1939, he joined the Royal Air Force, serving in Bomber Command as a radio operator and front gunner. He acquired his accent mixing with Canadian airmen. Sports commentator After the end of the war he returned to acting before commentating on tennis and football. He made his television wrestling commentary debut on the ITV network in November 1955, a job he kept for 33 years. At its peak in the 1970s, ITV's wrestling coverage, on World of Sport, could command up to 12 million between the football half-time and full-time results (4‚Äì4.40pm) on Saturdays. Although fans of ITV's wrestling coverage reportedly included the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Queen Mother and Margaret Thatcher, enthusiasm was not shared by ITV's Head of Sport, Greg Dyke, and in 1988 he dropped the sport, a blow from which it never recovered. Presenter  Kent Walton was a disc jockey on Radio Luxembourg, and for a time presented several tv music shows:- Honey Hit Parade, and then Cool for Cats from 1956 to 1961, then Discs A Gogo for TWW Television from 1961 to 1965. In the early sixties, he also acted as a judge on Thank Your Lucky Stars on ITV. Producer In the early 1970s he was involved with British sexploitation movies and is credited as a producer of such films as Clinic Exclusive, aka Clinic Xclusive, aka With These Hands (1971) (as \\"Elton Hawke\\"). He used other pseudonyms to keep this part of his life from his fans, but it was revealed in a 1975 episode of the TV documentary series Man Alive.

The main edition of the programme is aired at 20:00 (08:00 pm) on Das Erste. It is also simulcast on several ARD-affiliated networks, including NDR Fernsehen, RBB Fernsehen, SWR Fernsehen, WDR Fernsehen, hr-fernsehen, 3sat, Phoenix, EinsPlus, and ARD-alpha. It also broadcasts for most of the day on tagesschau24. In addition, recorded Tagesschau newscasts can also be seen via YouTube internationally.  History  Tagesschau (literally \\"Day's Show\\", or loosely \\"(Re)view of the Day\\"; a play on the term Wochenschau, the weekly newsreel formerly shown in cinemas) is both the oldest and the most watched news program on German television. The first edition was transmitted on Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk (North-Western German Broadcasting) on 26 December 1952. Initially broadcast three times a week, the programme expanded in 1956 to air Monday to Saturday, with Sunday editions beginning in 1961. The nightly 8-pm edition of Tagesschau is watched by up to 10 million viewers, equivalent to a 33% audience reach. Currently, the bulletin is produced by NDR (Northern German Broadcasting) through ARD-aktuell (the ARD's news department) from its studios in Hamburg. The main 15-minute bulletin is broadcast at 20:00 CET or CEST (08:00 pm CET or CEST) each evening with shorter bulletins broadcast throughout the day. The end of the 20:00 bulletin, at 20:15, marks the beginning of prime time on German television. An attempt by commercial station Sat.1 in the late 1990s to begin their prime time schedule at 20:00 was so unsuccessful that it was discontinued after only a few weeks. In 1978, the late edition of Tagesschau was replaced by Tagesthemen (Subjects of the Day or \\"Themes of the Day\\"), a half-hour programme featuring more in-depth reports, analysis, and commentary. The programme continues to air at 22:15 each evening. A late-night, magazine-style programme, Nachtmagazin (Night Magazine), airs at around 00:30. A weekly review programme entitled Wochenspiegel (Mirror of the Week) was produced by the Tagesschau production team and aired on Sundays around lunch time. The program aired its last episode on 24 August 2014 in a major reshuffle. The program's trademark continues to be the eight o'clock chime followed by a recorded announcement, spoken by Claudia Urbschat-Mingues, \\"Hier ist das Erste Deutsche Fernsehen mit der Tagesschau\\" (\\"This is First German Television with the Tagesschau\\"). The Tagesschau theme music has remained the same since 1956, although the arrangement has been modernized several times, most recently in 2014 by Hans Zimmer. On 25 July 1988 the Tagesschau was on the brink of being cancelled due to a warning strike organized by the broadcasting union RFFU. This blackout would have been for the first (and only) time in its history, but the Rundschau from Bavaria, produced by Bayerisches Fernsehen (Bavarian Television) in Munich, helped out as a substitute program. Tagesschau aired its 20,000th broadcast on 31 December 2010.

Media studies and criticism =Plurality of perspectives lacking= The long-term study of the Otto Brenner Stiftung by Hans-J√ºrgen Arlt and Wolfgang Storz from March 2010 on \\"Business Journalism during the crisis - The mass media handling of the financial market policy\\" analyzed working methods of the news broadcasts from 1999 to fall 2009, especially in news formats like Tagesschau and Tagesthemen. The study arrives at the conclusion that these formats failed during the crisis, due to the editorial team's lack of different perspectives, focusing solely on representatives of the German government, banks, some scientists and their points of view. \\"This narrowing of perspective leads to severe losses of reality which is to be considered as serious journalistic misconduct\\". = Bias in covering the Ukraine-Crisis 2013/2014 = In September 2014, following a critical review from the editorial council (Programmbeirat), ARD-aktuell stated: \\"Criticism of our news-coverage respecting the Ukraine has caused an echo on a hitherto unprecedented scale\\"., Kai Gniffke: Zwischenbilanz: Der Ukraine-Konflikt in der Tagesschau, ARD-aktuell vom 29.

Public broadcaster ZDF had carried the story. Tagesschaus reasons for not reporting it were subjected to criticism, Stern magazine wrote that they had given an \\"absurd\\" explanation for their \\"ignorance\\". Two days later, ARD magazine Tagesthemen started to report about the case after public pressure. When chancellor Angela Merkel was questioned about the case during the programme, she stated: \\"If the fact should prove true that an Afghan refugee is responsible, then we should absolutely condemn this, exactly as in the case of any other murderer, and we should clearly name this.\\" ARD announced their intent to engage a \\"quality manager\\" henceforth to deal with the growing public criticism of their decisions.

It is located in the Solano County city of Benicia, west of downtown Benicia and borders Vallejo's Glen Cove neighborhood. The park covers of marsh, grassy hillsides and rocky beaches along the narrowest portion of the Carquinez Strait. Southampton Creek and the tidal marsh front Southampton Bay, where the combined waters of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers approach San Pablo Bay, the northern portion of San Francisco Bay. History Don Jos√© de Ca√±izares ‚Äî diarist on the 1769 overland Portola expedition and who sailed with Don Juan Manuel de Ayala on the San Carlos, the first ship to enter San Francisco Bay on August 5, 1775 ‚Äî named the cove north and west of Benicia Puerto de las Asunta (Assumption Harbor in Spanish) because he discovered it on that feast day in 1775. The cove is noted as \\"J\\" on Ca√±izares' famous 1781 Map of San Francisco Bay. The present name, Southampton Bay, is for the Navy frigate Southampton, which Commodore Thomas ap Catesby Jones sailed, along with a small fleet, to the cove in 1849. The sandstone point at Benicia SRA has been known as Rocky Point, Quarry Point and now Dillon Point. Stonecutter Patrick Dillon came to California from Tipperary, Ireland, during the 1849 California Gold Rush, settling in Benicia in 1851. General Vallejo leased Dillon the tidal flat at Southampton Bay and Rocky Point peninsula for a sandstone quarry. When the sandstone played out, the Dillon family and subsequent owners raised sheep and grapes until the State acquired the property in 1967. Habitat and wildlife Great blue heron at Dillon Point, Benicia SRA 2009 The Southampton Bay Wetland Natural Preserve makes up 70% of the park. The Southampton mudflat formed eroded upriver silt and clay deposits exceeds thick. The principal habitats here are brackish marsh, saltwater marsh and freshwater marsh. This rare and endangered wetland ecosystem is covered with marsh plants such as salt grass (Distichlis spicata), pickleweed (Batis maritima), coyote bush (Baccharis pilularis) and soft bird's-beak (Cordylanthus mollis). Bird‚Äôs-beak is an endangered gray- green annual herb in the snapdragon family. Park mammals include the federally endangered northern salt marsh harvest mice (Reithrodontomys raviventris halicoetes). Other mammals living in the park are coyote (Canis latrans), river otter (Lontra canadensis), muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) and California golden beaver (Castor canadensis subauratus). The beaver probably migrated from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta in 2007. Historically, before the California Fur Rush of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the Delta probably held the largest concentration of beaver in North America. It was California's early fur trade, more than any other single factor, that opened up the West, and the San Francisco Bay Area in particular, to world trade. In 1840, explorer Captain Thomas Farnham wrote that \\"There is probably no spot of equal extent in the whole continent of America which contains so many of these muchsought animals.\\" Benicia SRA has been designated an Important Bird Area, providing habitat for endangered California clapper rails (Rallus longirostris obsoletus) and black rails (Laterallus jamaicensis). Other uncommon species include Virginia rails (Rallus limicola), Suisun song sparrows (Melospiza melodia maxillaris) and salt marsh common yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas sinuosa). On their journey along the Pacific Flyway, many waterfowl winter in the park. Recreation Cyclists, runners, walkers and roller skaters enjoy the park's 2.5 miles (4 km) of road and bike paths. The Hike and Bike Trail‚Äîtwo parallel, paved, accessible trails‚Äîbegins at the Military West entrance and runs 0.75 miles to the main park entrance, joining Dillon Point Road for 1.5 miles. The trail system is part of the Bay Area Ridge Trail and San Francisco Bay Trail. Most popular is the 1.5-mile-long walk out to Dillon Point on the park road. Picnicking is available at the group picnic area, one mile into the park. The Forrest Deaner Native Plants Botanic Garden is located at the end of the picnic area, offering displays of and information about plants native to the Bay Area. From the top of Dillon Point, you can trace the route of the Carquinez Strait Scenic Loop Trail, a 50-mile route that will, when finished, ring the strait. Dillon's Point offers prime shore fishing for white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), starry flounder (Platichthys stellatus) and striped bass (Morone saxatilis).

Green Gables served as the setting for the Anne of Green Gables novels by Lucy Maud Montgomery. Green Gables is recognized as a Federal Historic Building by the government of Canada, and is situated on the L.M. Montgomery's Cavendish National Historic Site of Canada. The National Historic Site itself is situated on Prince Edward Island National Park. The building was initially erected by the MacNeil family during the 1830s, relatives of Montgomery who was born nearby the homestead. Interest for the Green Gables property grew in the decades after Montgomery published her novels; resulting in Green Gables purchase by the government of Canada in 1936. The government initially operated the home as a historic house that depicted 19th century farming life on Prince Edward Island. However, by the 1970s, plans were undertaken to refurbish the building to resemble Green Gables as depicted in Montgomery's novels. Since 1985, Green Gables, and the larger National Historic Site operate as a museum on Lucy Maud Montgomery and her novels. History Green Gables was initially owned by the MacNeil family, relatives of Lucy Maud Montgomery, the author of Anne of Green Gables. The building was initially built by the family during the 1830s, and was expanded during the 1870s and in 1921; the latter expansion resulting in the building's present L-shape. In 1908, Montgomery published Anne of Green Gables, with Green Gables serving as the home for the titular character Anne Shirley. Interest in the home grew after the publication of Anne of Green Gables, and the release of a movie based on the novels in 1934. With Green Gables vacant during the 1930s, the government of Canada purchased the property in 1936; as a part of a larger effort to develop Prince Edward Island National Park. In 1938, plans were made to develop Green Gables into a clubhouse for the adjacent golf course; although these plans were abandoned after public backlash against the proposal. After Montgomery's death in 1942, her body was transported from Ontario to Prince Edward Island, with a funeral ceremony held at Green Gables. \\"Anne's Room,\\" is one of several rooms in farmhouse made to resemble the setting in Montgomery's novels During the 1950s, the home was furnished with period-appropriate furniture and was used as a historic house. During the 1970s, the building was refurnished and remodelled to resemble the Green Gables as depicted in Montgomery's novels. In the same decade, the building was expanded again; before it underwent significant restorations in 1985, after Parks Canada decided to switch the furnishing in the home to reflect how Green Gables was depicted in Montgomery's novels. On 10 July 1985, Green Gables was officially designated as a Federal Heritage Building as an example of 19th century architecture in the province, and for the home's importance to the literary community. The larger property, including the ruins of Montgomery's homestead were designated as the L.M. Montgomery's Cavendish National Historic Site of Canada in 2004. In 2017, the government unveiled a million restoration plan to restore the Green Gables building, in addition to building a new interpretive centre. On 29 August 2020, an interpretive centre built north of the Green Gables homestead was opened to the public; with Hisako, Princess Takamado in attendance for the interpretive centre's grand opening. Property Lovers' Lane is one of several trails situated on the property that surrounds Green Gables Green Gables is situated on the L.M. Montgomery's Cavendish National Historic Site of Canada, a large property that also includes Montgomery's homestead, greenspaces that served as inspiration for Montgomery's novel, and several trails including Haunted Woods, Lovers' Lane, and Balsam Hollow. The larger property was designated as a National Historic Site of Canada on 12 October 2004. The property itself is situated within Prince Edward Island National Park. The National Historic Site is largely divided into two areas, Montgomery's home and Green Gables. The former served as the home for the author of Anne of Green Gables and consists of the ruins of her home and other farm buildings from the late-19th century. Green Gables is situated to the west of Montgomery's home; with the lands surrounding Green Gables also including a historic schoolhouse, farm buildings, and trails. In 2019, an interpretive centre built north of Green Gables was opened to the public, and houses exhibitions on Montgomery and her novels, particularly Anne of Green Gables. Designed by Root Architecture, the centre includes exhibition spaces, gift shop, and offices. The interpretive centre surrounds a courtyard. Timber framing and panels is used throughout the interpretive centre. =Green Gables= White-painted shingles are used throughout the building, with green being the only other major colour found on the building's exterior. Green Gables is a one-and-a-half storey L-shaped home clad in white-painted shingles throughout; with the only other colour present on the building being the green-gabled rooftop and its window shutters. The green gable and shutters were painted onto the building shortly after the federal government purchased it in 1936, in an effort to make the building more \\"suitable,\\" for its opening. There are six windows on the two floors of the building, each with shutters. The includes five bedrooms, a dining room, sewing room, and a parlour. Although wood is used throughout the home, the building's chimneys are made of brick.

It was established in 1985. Registrants of .us domains must be U.S. citizens, residents, or organizations, or a foreign entity with a presence in the United States. Most registrants in the U.S. have registered for .com, .net, .org and other gTLDs, instead of .us, which has primarily been used by state and local governments, even though private entities may also register .us domains. History On February 15, 1985, .us was created as the Internet's first ccTLD. Its original administrator was Jon Postel of the Information Sciences Institute (ISI) at the University of Southern California (USC). He administered .us under a subcontract that the ISI and USC had from SRI International (which held the .us and the gTLD contract with the United States Department of Defense) and later Network Solutions (which held the .us and the gTLD contract with the National Science Foundation). Postel and his colleague Ann Westine Cooper codified the .us ccTLD's policies in December 1992 as RFC 1386 and revised them the following June in RFC 1480. Registrants could only register third-level domains or higher in a geographic and organizational hierarchy. From June 1993 to June 1997, Postel delegated the vast majority of the geographic subdomains under .us to various public and private entities. .us registrants could register with the delegated manager for the specific zone they wished to register in, but not directly with the .us administrator. In July 1997, Postel instituted a \\"50/500 rule\\" that limited each delegated manager to 500 localities maximum, 50 in a given state. In June 1998, Postel raised the possibility of covering IANA operating costs by charging locality name registrars, who would pass the costs along to individual registrants. In September 1998, the United States Postal Service proposed funding the operations in order to assume control of .us, as part of a plan to diversify away from postage revenue. On October 1, 1998, the NSF transferred oversight of the .us domain to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) of the United States Department of Commerce.Requesting comments on draft statement of work regarding .us Postel died that month, leaving his domain administration responsibilities with ISI. In December 2000, these responsibilities were transferred to Network Solutions, which had recently been acquired by Verisign.Amendment 21 to the NSI Cooperative AgreementTHE GLOBALISATION OF REGULATION AND ITS IMPACT ON THE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM : DOMAIN NAMES AND A NEW REGULATORY ECONOMY by ELIZABETH A WILLIAMS On October 26, 2001, Neustar was awarded the contract to administer .us. On April 24, 2002, second-level domains under .us became available for registration. One of the first .us domain hacks, icio.us, was registered on May 3, 2002, for the creation of the subdomain del.icio.us.Whois query for the domain names \\"DELICIO.US\\" and \\"ICIO.US\\". Whois database last updated March 29, 2015. Accessed March 29, 2015. A moratorium was placed on additional delegations of locality-based namespaces, and Neustar became the default delegate for undelegated localities.Manheim, Karl M. and Solum, Lawrence B., \\"An Economic Analysis of Domain Name Policy\\" (2004). University of San Diego Law and Economics Research Paper Series. 1. http://digital.sandiego.edu/lwps_econ/art1 Neustar's contract was renewed by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) in 2007 and most recently in 2014. On March 31st, 2019, The .US registry made it clear that under its Acceptable Use Policy it would not allow the sale of opioids through the .US top level domain.https://www.about.us/blog/tackling-the- opioid-crisis-by-cutting-off-online-sales-in-the-ustld  Locality namespace  The .us ccTLD is historically organized under a complex locality namespace hierarchy. Until second-level registrations were introduced in 2002, .us permitted only fourth-level domain registrations of the form ...us, with some exceptions for government entities. Registrants of locality-based domains must meet the same criteria as in the rest of the .us ccTLD. Though the locality namespace is most commonly used for government entities, it is also open to registrations by private businesses and individuals. Since 2002, second-level domain registrations have eclipsed those in the locality namespace, and many local governments have transitioned to .org and other TLDs. In the 2010s, the first top-level domains for U.S. cities became available as paid alternatives to third-level locality domains, including .nyc as an alternative to .new- york.ny.us. Many locality-based zones of .us are delegated to various public and private entities known as delegated managers. Domains in these zones are registered through the delegated manager, rather than through Neustar. As the delegated managers are expected to receive requests directly from registrants, few if any domain name registrars serve this space, possibly contributing to its lower visibility and utilization. RFC 1480 describes the rationale for the locality namespace's deep hierarchy and local delegation: This hierarchical system has proven unappealing to companies that operate nationally or globally. As of October 31, 2013, 12,979 domains were registered under the locality namespace, of which 3,653 were managed by about 1,300 delegated managers while 9,326 were managed by Neustar as the de facto manager. According to a 2013 survey of 539 delegated managers, 282 were state or local government agencies, while 98 were private individuals and 85 were commercial Internet service providers. Nearly 90% of the respondents offer domain registrations for free. The .au and .ca ccTLDs have also established third- and fourth-level locality namespaces, though the .ca locality namespace is no longer open to registrations. The .cn ccTLD maintains a third-level locality namespace in general use. =States and territories = A two-letter second- level domain is formally reserved for each U.S. state, federal territory, and the District of Columbia. Each domain corresponds to a USPS abbreviation. For example, .ny.us is reserved for websites affiliated with New York, while .va.us is for those affiliated with Virginia. Second-level domains are also reserved for five U.S. territories: .as.us for American Samoa, .gu.us for Guam, .mp.us for the Northern Mariana Islands, .pr.us for Puerto Rico, and .vi.us for the U.S. Virgin Islands. However, these domains go unused because each territory has its own ccTLD per ISO 3166-1 alpha-2: respectively, .as, .gu, .mp, .pr, and .vi. A state's main government portal is usually found at the third-level domain state..us, which is reserved for this purpose. However, some state administrations prefer .gov domains: for example, California's government portal is located at both and , while redirects to Massachusetts's portal at . Fully spelled-out names of states are also reserved under .us, so the State of Ohio's website was at one point available at in addition to the usual , with the former remaining as a redirect. Other than for state governments, no third-level domain registrations are permitted under state or territory second-level domains. A few additional names are reserved at the second level for government agencies that are not subordinate to a state government: * fed.us for agencies of the U.S. federal government (which in practice generally use .gov) ** Example: (United States Forest Service) * isa.us for interstate authorities created by interstate compacts ** Example: (Interstate Mining Compact Commission) * nsn.us for Native Sovereign Nations (which may also use -nsn.gov) ** Example: (Mohegan Tribe) * dni.us for distributed national institutes ** Example: (Conference of Chief Justices, part of the National Center for State Courts) =Locality domains= A large number of third-level domains are reserved for localities within states. Each fourth-level domain registration under this namespace follows the format ...us, where is a state's two-letter postal abbreviation and is a hyphenated name that corresponds to a ZIP code or appears in a well-known atlas. Two values of are formally reserved across the entire locality namespace for city and county governments: * ci...us for city governments ** Example: (Davenport, Iowa) * co...us for county governments ** Example: (Adams County, Idaho) Delegated managers often reserve additional names for different kinds of local governments: * borough...us for borough governments ** Example: (Shippensburg, Pennsylvania) * city...us for city governments ** Example: (Cleveland, Ohio) * county...us for county governments * parish...us for parish governments (unused) * town...us for town governments ** Example: (Windermere, Florida) * twp...us or township...us for township governments ** Examples: (Russell Township, Geauga County, Ohio), (Stroud Township, Monroe County, Pennsylvania) * vil...us or village...us for village governments ** Examples: (Stockbridge, Michigan), (Fairport, New York) In some cases, a local government that serves as the delegated manager for its own locality may locate its website directly under the , omitting the . For example, the website of the City of Brunswick, Ohio, is located at rather than www.ci.brunswick.oh.us, and the website of Delhi Township, Hamilton County, Ohio, is located at instead of www.twp.delhi.oh.us. Private organizations and individuals may register fourth-level domains parallel to these government domains, for example: * (a family in San Jose, California) =Affinity namespaces= Directly beneath the .us zone, several affinity namespaces are reserved for specific purposes: * state: state government agencies (.state..us) ** Example: (Governor of Alaska) * dst: government agencies in administrative districts (.dst..us) ** Example: (a water district in California) * cog: councils of governments, that is, federations of cities or counties (.cog..us) ** Example: (Texoma Council of Governments) * k12: public elementary and/or secondary unified school districts (.k12..us), or individual schools (.k12..us) ** Examples: (San Francisco Unified School District), (Pioneer Career and Technology Center) ** pvt.k12: private elementary or secondary schools (.pvt.k12..us or ..pvt.k12..us) *** Examples: (Firelands Montessori Academy), (a private K-12 school in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cleveland in Ohio) * cc: community colleges (.cc..us) ** Example: (Clackamas Community College) * tec: technical and vocational schools (.tec..us) ** Example: (Alexandria Technical and Community College) * lib: public libraries (.lib..us) ** Example: (Monroe County District Library) * mus: museums (.mus..us) ** Example: (a local historical museum) * gen: general independent entities (clubs or other groups not fitting into the above categories) (.gen..us) ** Examples: (an amateur radio association in Minnesota), (Texas Regional Hostmaster, the .tx.us delegated manager) Some of these affinity namespaces have been supplanted by more convenient sponsored top-level domains. The first sTLD, .museum, became available in October 2001 as an alternative to the .mus namespace. Since April 2003, the .edu top-level domain has been available as an alternative for community colleges, technical and vocational schools, and other tertiary educational institutions that might have previously used the .cc or .tec affinity namespaces. Although the Kentucky Department of Education operates the .k12.ky.us namespace for Kentucky school districts, most districts instead use subdomains of the less formal domain kyschools.us, which the department operates in a similar manner. For example, Gallatin county schools have a website at , while Paducah Public Schools are located at and the McCracken County Public Schools use as a redirect to . Kids.us The Dot Kids Implementation and Efficiency Act of 2002 () established a .kids.us second- level domain. The general public could register third-level domains under .kids.us for educational content that met strict requirements, including conformance to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and adherence to Children's Advertising Review Unit standards. Webpages were prohibited from linking outside the .kids.us namespace. On July 27, 2012, in response to declining usage and a petition by Neustar the previous year, the NTIA suspended .kids.us registrations. By that time, 651 domains were registered under .kids.us, and only six registrants were operating active websites.  Restrictions on use of .us domains  Under .us nexus requirements, .us domains may be registered only by the following qualified entities: * Any United States citizen or resident, * Any United States entity, such as organizations or corporations, * Any foreign entity or organization with a bona fide presence in the United States To ensure that these requirements are met, Neustar frequently conducts \\"spot checks\\" on registrant information. To prevent anonymous registrations that do not meet these requirements, in 2005 the National Telecommunications and Information Administration ruled that registrants of .us domains may not secure private domain name registration via anonymizing proxies, and that their contact information must be made public. Registrants are required to provide complete contact information without omissions. Under the locality namespace, delegated managers may impose additional requirements. For example, the Texas Regional Hostmaster restricts each of its delegated localities to organizations that have a mailing address in that locality.

The park is dedicated to California‚Äôs third capitol building, where the California State Legislature convened from February 3, 1853 to February 24, 1854, when they voted to move the state capital to Sacramento. It is the only pre-Sacramento capitol that remaines. The park includes the Fischer-Hanlon House, an early Benicia building that was moved to the property and converted into a home in 1858, after the legislature departed. Benicia Capitol State Historic Park just off the city's main street also includes a carriage house, workers' quarters and sculptured gardens. History Following large complaints by state legislators of inadequate furniture and sleeping quarters in Vallejo, California in early-1853, the Legislature, with the consent of Governor John Bigler, relocated the state capital to nearby Benicia that same year. The Legislature would convene in the Benicia City Hall for a little more than a year, when again complaints over poor weather conditions, inadequate and uncomfortable sleeping quarters, and \\"the insecure condition of the public archives\\" arose in January 1854. After a proposal by Sacramento to use the Sacramento County Courthouse free of charge as a capital building, the Assembly and Senate passed an enabling act, voiding all previous legislation, to move the state capital to its new location upriver in Sacramento. On February 25, 1854, Governor Bigler signed the act into law, moving the capital to its current location. The Legislature and governor climbed aboard the steamship Wilson G. Hunt to take up its new quarters.\\"Arrival of the State Officers, State Archives, and Members of the State Legislature.\\" Sacramento Union. 1854-03-01. \\"So much opposed to the removal were the good people of Benicia,\\" the Sacramento Union reported, \\"that the owners of the wharves, it is stated, refused to permit the steamer ... to land to take on the legislative furniture, unless she would pay $500.\\" This request was refused and the furniture was shipped from a different wharf.\\"First Session of the Legislature at Sacramento -- Benicia.\\" Sacramento Union. 1854-03-02. The Greek Revival-Palladian building was listed as a California State Historic Landmark on January 11, 1935. The National Register of Historic Places placed the Benicia capitol on the federal list on February 12, 1971. Present day The original building has been restored with reconstructed period furnishings and exhibits. The interior includes a reconstruction of the building's original floor with ponderosa pine. The desks, four of which are from the 1850s or earlier, are furnished with a candlestick, a 19th-century newspaper, a quill pen, blotting sand, a spitoon, and a top hat. The historic park is located at 115 West G Street in Benicia, a city in the northern San Francisco Bay Area between San Pablo Bay and Suisun Bay.

He painted primarily religious works, but also mythological and allegorical subjects. Active in Rome, Naples, and his native Bologna, he became the dominant figure in the Bolognese School that emerged under the influence of the Carracci. Biography Born in Bologna into a family of musicians, Guido Reni was the only child of Daniele Reni and Ginevra Pozzi.Spear, Richard E. \\"Reni, Guido\\". Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. At the age of nine, he was apprenticed to the Bolognese studio of Denis Calvaert. Soon after, he was joined in that studio by Albani and Domenichino. He may also have trained with a painter by the name of Ferrantini. When Reni was about twenty years old, the three Calvaert pupils migrated to the rising rival studio, named Accademia degli Incamminati (Academy of the \\"newly embarked\\", or progressives), led by Ludovico Carracci. They went on to form the nucleus of a prolific and successful school of Bolognese painters who followed Lodovico's cousin Annibale Carracci to Rome. Reni completed commissions for his first altarpieces while in the Carracci academy. He left the academy by 1598, after an argument with Ludovico Carracci over unpaid work. Around this time he made his first prints, a series commemorating Pope Clement VIII's visit to Bologna in 1598. =Work in Rome= By late 1601, Reni and Albani had moved to RomeGuido Reni: A Review Reviewed, Stephen D. Pepper; Richard E. Spear. The Burlington Magazine (1990)132(10): p219‚Äì223. to work with the teams led by Annibale Carracci in fresco decoration of the Farnese Palace. During 1601‚Äì1604, his main patron was Cardinal Paolo Emilio Sfondrati. By 1604‚Äì1605, he received an independent commission for an altarpiece of the Crucifixion of St. Peter. After returning briefly to Bologna, he went back to Rome to become one of the premier painters during the papacy of Paul V (Borghese); between 1607‚Äì1614, he was one of the painters most patronized by the Borghese family. Bacchus and Ariadne, circa 1619‚Äì1620, Los Angeles County Museum of Art Reni's frescoed ceiling of the large central hall of the Casino dell'Aurora, located in the grounds of the Palazzo Pallavicini-Rospigliosi, is often considered his fresco masterpiece. The building was originally a pavilion commissioned by Cardinal Scipione Borghese; the rear portion overlooks the Piazza Montecavallo and Palazzo del Quirinale. The massive fresco is framed in quadri riportati and depicts Apollo in his Chariot preceded by Dawn (Aurora) bringing light to the world. The work is restrained in classicism, copying poses from Roman sarcophagi, and showing far more simplicity and restraint than Carracci's riotous Triumph of Bacchus and Ariadne in the Farnese. In this painting Reni allies himself more with the sterner Cavaliere d'Arpino, Lanfranco, and Albani \\"School\\" of mytho-historic painting, and less with the more crowded frescoes characteristic of Pietro da Cortona. There is little concession to perspective, and the vibrantly colored style is antithetical to the tenebrism of Caravaggio's followers. Documents show that Reni was paid 247 scudi and 54 baiocchi upon completion of his work on 24 September 1616. In 1630, the Barberini family of Pope Urban VIII commissioned from Reni a painting of the Archangel Michael for the church of Santa Maria della Concezione dei Cappuccini.Harris, Ann Sutherland (2005). Seventeenth-century Art and Architecture. Laurence King Publishing. p. 71. . The painting, completed in 1636, gave rise to an old legend that Reni had represented Satan‚Äîcrushed under St Michael's foot‚Äîwith the facial features of Cardinal Giovanni Battista Pamphilj in revenge for a slight. St Michael Archangel, 1636. The Archangel Michael trampling Satan wears a late-Roman military cloak and cuirass. Held in Santa Maria della Concezione dei Cappuccini, Rome. Reni also frescoed the Paoline Chapel of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome as well as the Aldobrandini wings of the Vatican. According to rumor, the pontifical chapel of Montecavallo (Chapel of the Annunciation) was assigned to Reni to paint. However, because he felt underpaid by the papal ministers, the artist left Rome once again for Bologna, leaving the role of the preeminent artist in Rome to Domenichino. =Work in Naples and return to Bologna= Saint Joseph and the Christ Child, 1640 Joseph and Potiphar's Wife, c.1630 Returning to Bologna more or less permanently after 1614, Reni established a successful and prolific studio there. He was commissioned to decorate the cupola of the chapel of Saint Dominic in Bologna's Basilica of San Domenico between 1613 and 1615, resulting in the radiant fresco Saint Dominic in Glory, a masterpiece that can stand comparison with the exquisite Arca di San Domenico below it. He also contributed to the decoration of the Rosary Chapel in the same church, with a Resurrection; and in 1611 he had already painted for San Domenico a superb Massacre of the Innocents, now in the Pinacoteca Nazionale di Bologna, which became an important reference for the French Neoclassic style, as well as a model for details in Picasso's Guernica. In 1614‚Äì15 he painted The Israelites Gathering Manna for a chapel in the cathedral of Ravenna. Leaving Bologna briefly in 1618, Reni traveled to Naples to complete a commission to paint a ceiling in a chapel of the cathedral of San Gennaro.Pepper, S. (ed.) Guido Reni, 1575-1642, Los Angeles & Bologna: 1988. However, in Naples, other prominent local painters, including Corenzio, Caracciolo and Ribera, were vehemently resistant to competitors, and according to rumor, conspired to poison or otherwise harm Reni (as may have befallen Domenichino in Naples after him). Reni, who had a great fear of being poisoned (and of witchcraft), chose not to outstay his welcome. After leaving Rome, Reni alternately painted in different styles, but displayed less eclectic tastes than many of Carracci's trainees. For example, his altarpiece for Samson Victorious formulates stylized poses, like those characteristic of Mannerism.The victorious Samson (Wikicommons) In contrast, his Crucifixion and his Atlanta and Hipomenes depict dramatic diagonal movement coupled with the effects of light and shade that portray the more Baroque influence of Caravaggio. His turbulent yet realistic Massacre of the Innocents (Pinacoteca, Bologna) is painted in a manner reminiscent of a late Raphael. In 1625, Prince W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sigismund Vasa of Poland visited the artist's workshop in Bologna during his visit to Western Europe. The close rapport between the painter and the Polish prince resulted in the acquisition of drawings and paintings. In 1630, Reni painted the Pallion del Voto with images of Saints Ignatius of Loyola and Francis Xavier, painted during the plague of 1630 that afflicted Bologna. By the 1630s, Reni's painting style became looser, less impastoed, and dominated by lighter colors. A compulsive gambler, Reni was often in financial distress despite the steady demand for his paintings. According to his biographer Carlo Cesare Malvasia, Reni's need to recoup gambling losses resulted in rushed execution and multiple copies of his works produced by his workshop. Among the paintings of his last years are many unfinished works. Reni's themes are mostly biblical and mythological. He painted few portraits; those of Sixtus V, and Cardinal Bernardino Spada are among the most noteworthy, along with one of his mother (in the Pinacoteca Nazionale di Bologna) and a few self-portraits from both his youth and his old age. (The so‚Äëcalled \\"Beatrice Cenci\\", formerly ascribed to Reni and praised by generations of admirers, is now regarded as a doubtful attribution. Beatrice Cenci was executed in Rome before Reni ever lived there and so could not have sat for the portrait.) Many etchings are attributed to Guido Reni, some after his own paintings and some after other masters. They are spirited, in a light style of delicate lines and dots. Reni's technique was used by the Bolognese school and was the standard for Italian printmakers of his time. Reni died in Bologna in 1642. He was buried there in the Rosary Chapel of the Basilica of San Domenico; the painter Elisabetta Sirani, whose father had been Reni's pupil and who was considered by some to be the artistic reincarnation of Reni, was later interred in the same tomb. Pupils and legacy Reni was the most famous Italian artist of his generation. Through his many pupils, he had wide-ranging influence on later Baroque. In the center of Bologna he established two studios, teeming with nearly 200 pupils. His most distinguished pupil was Simone Cantarini, named Il Pesarese, who painted the portrait of his master now in the Bolognese Gallery. Reni's other Bolognese pupils included Antonio Randa (early on in his career considered the best pupil of Reni, until he tried to kill his master), Vincenzo Gotti,Orlandi, p. 425. Emilio Savonanzi,Orlandi, p. 136. Sebastiano Brunetti,Orlandi, p. 398. Tommaso Campana,Orlandi, p. 416. Domenico Maria Canuti,Orlandi, p. 128. Bartolomeo Marescotti,Orlandi, p. 83. Giovanni Maria Tamburino,Orlandi, p. 249. and Pietro Gallinari (Pierino del Signor Guido).

Beyond Italy, Reni's influence was important in the style of many Spanish Baroque artists, such as Jusepe de Ribera and Murillo. But his work was particularly appreciated in France‚ÄîStendhal believed Reni must have had \\"a French soul\\"‚Äîand influenced generations of French artists such as Le Sueur, Le Brun, Vien, and Greuze; as well as on later French Neoclassic painters. In the 19th century, Reni's reputation declined as a result of changing taste‚Äîepitomized by John Ruskin's censorious judgment that the artist's work was sentimental and false.Kimmelman, Michael, \\"Renewed Luster for a Baroque Master, The New York Times, 20 March 1989. Retrieved 28 May 2017. A revival of interest in Reni has occurred since 1954, when an important retrospective exhibition of his work was mounted in Bologna.

Hughes Helicopters also developed the Model 369 as a civilian helicopter, and the Hughes Model 500, currently produced by MD Helicopters as the MD 500. Development In 1960, the United States Army issued Technical Specification 153 for a Light Observation Helicopter (LOH) capable of fulfilling various roles: personnel transport, escort and attack missions, casualty evacuation and observation. Twelve companies took part in the competition and Hughes Tool Company's Aircraft Division submitted the Model 369. Two designs, those submitted by Fairchild-Hiller and Bell, were selected as finalists by the Army-Navy design competition board, but the U.S. Army later included the helicopter from Hughes as well. OH-6 helicopter in flight The first Model 369 prototype flew on 27 February 1963. Originally designated as the YHO-6A according to the Army's designation system, the aircraft was redesignated as the YOH-6A in 1962 when the Department of Defense created a Joint designation system for all aircraft. Five prototypes were built, fitted with a Allison T63-A-5A, and delivered to the U.S. Army at Fort Rucker, Alabama to compete against the other ten prototype aircraft submitted by Bell and Fairchild-Hiller. During the course of the competition, the Bell submission, the YOH-4, was eliminated as being underpowered (it used the T63-A-5). The bidding for the LOH contract came down to Fairchild-Hiller and Hughes. Hughes won the competition, and the Army awarded a contract for production in May 1965, with an initial order for 714 that was later increased to 1,300 with an option on another 114. Hughes's price was $19,860 per airframe, less engine, while Hiller's price was $29,415 per airframe, less engine.Hearings on military posture and H.R. 13456, p. 7832. The Hiller design (designated OH-5A) had a boosted control system, while the Hughes design did not. This would account for some of the price difference. Hughes is reported to have told Jack Real that he lost over $100 million in building 1,370 airframes.Cefaratt 2002, p. 77.Real, Jack. \\"The Real Story.\\" Vertiflite, Fall/Winter 1999, pp. 36‚Äì39. It was reported that Howard Hughes had directed his company to submit a bid at a price below the actual production cost of the helicopter in order to secure this order, resulting in substantial losses on the U.S. Army deal, with the anticipation that an extended production cycle would eventually prove financially viable. In 1968 Hughes submitted a bid to build a further 2,700 airframes. Stanley Hiller complained to the U.S. Army that Hughes had used unethical procedures; therefore, the Army opened the contract for rebidding by all parties. Hiller did not participate in the rebidding, but Bell did, with their redesigned Model 206. After a competitive fly-off, the Army asked for sealed bids. Hughes bid $56,550 per airframe, while Bell bid $54,200. Reportedly, Hughes had consulted at the last moment with his confidant Jack Real, who recommended a bid of $53,550. Hughes, without telling him, added $3,000 to the bid and thus lost the contract. =Japanese OH-6= In Japan, 387 OH-6/Hughes 369s were produced under license by Kawasaki Heavy Industries and used by the Japanese Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF), Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF), the Japanese Coast Guard, and civilian operators. Beginning in 2001, the JGSDF OH-6s were being replaced by the Kawasaki OH-1 observation helicopter. Operational history =Entry into service= In 1964 the U.S. Department of Defense issued a memorandum directing that all U.S. Army fixed-wing aircraft be transferred to the U.S. Air Force, while the U.S. Army made the transition to rotor-wing aircraft. The U.S. Army's fixed-wing airplane, the O-1 Bird Dog, which was utilized for artillery observation and reconnaissance, would be replaced by the OH-6A helicopter.Adcock 1998, p. 32. The aircraft entered service in 1966, arriving in the Vietnam War thereafter. The pilots dubbed the new helicopter Loach, a word created by pronunciation of the acronym of the program that spawned the aircraft, LOH (light observation helicopter). =World records= Shortly after production began, the OH-6 began to demonstrate what kind of an impact it would have on the world of helicopters. The OH-6 set 23 world records for helicopters in 1966 for speed, endurance and time to climb.\\"History of Rotorcraft World Records, List of records established by the 'YOH-6A'.\\" F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale (FAI).

The aircraft, dubbed 500P (penetrator) by Hughes, began as an ARPA project, codenamed \\"Mainstreet\\", in 1968. Development included test and training flights in Culver City, California (Hughes Airport) and at Area 51 in 1971. In order to reduce their acoustic signature, the helicopters (N351X and N352X) received a four-blade 'scissors' style tail rotor (later incorporated into the Hughes-designed AH-64 Apache), a fifth rotor blade and reshaped rotor tips, a modified exhaust system and various performance-boosts. Deployed to a secret base in southern Laos (PS-44) in June 1972, one of the helicopters was heavily damaged during a training mission late in the summer. The remaining helicopter deployed a wiretap near Vinh, Vietnam on the night of 5‚Äì6 December 1972, which provided the United States with useful information during the Linebacker II campaign and Paris Peace Talks. Shortly thereafter, the aircraft were returned to the U.S., dismantled and quietly found new homes as the now-standard 500s. 964 out of the 1,422 OH-6As built for the US Army were destroyed in Vietnam, mostly from hostile ground fire. =160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment= Following the April 1980 failure of Operation Eagle Claw (the attempted rescue of American hostages in Tehran), it was determined that the military lacked aircraft and crews who were trained and prepared to perform special operations missions. To remedy this shortcoming, the Army began developing a special aviation task force to prepare for the next attempt to rescue the hostages: Operation Honey Badger. Task Force 160 The architects of the task force identified the need for a small helicopter to land in the most restrictive locations and that was also easily transported on Air Force transport aircraft. They chose the OH-6A scout helicopter to fill that role, and it became known as the Little Bird compared to the other aircraft in the task force, the MH-60 and the MH-47. As a separate part of the project, armed OH-6As were being developed at Fort Rucker, Alabama.Durant and Hartov 2006, pp. 48‚Äì49. The pilots selected to fly the OH-6A helicopters came from the 229th Attack Helicopter Battalion and were sent to the Mississippi Army National Guard's Army Aviation Support Facility (AASF) at Gulfport, Mississippi, for two weeks of qualification training in the aircraft. When the training was completed, C-141 aircraft transported the aircraft and crews to Fort Huachuca, Arizona, for two weeks of mission training. The mission training consisted of loading onto C-130 transport aircraft which would then transport them to forward staging areas over routes as long as . The armed OH-6 aircraft from Fort Rucker joined the training program in the fall of 1980.Durant and Hartov 2006, p. 56. Operation Honey Badger was canceled after the hostages were released on 20 January 1981, and for a short while, it looked as if the task force would be disbanded and the personnel returned to their former units. But the Army decided that it would be more prudent to keep the unit in order to be prepared for future contingencies. The task force, which had been designated as Task Force 158, was soon formed into the 160th Aviation Battalion. The OH-6A helicopters used for transporting personnel became the MH-6 aircraft of the Light Assault Company and the armed OH-6As became the AH-6 aircraft of the Light Attack Company. On 1 October 1986, to help meet the increasing demands for support, the 1-245th Aviation Battalion from the Oklahoma National Guard, which had 25 AH-6 and 23 UH-1 helicopters, was placed under the operational control of the 160th. The 1-245th AVN BN enlisted were sent to the Mississippi Army National Guard's Army Aviation Support Facility (AASF) at Gulfport, Mississippi, for two weeks of qualification training in the aircraft. The following two-week mission was to Yuma for night operation training. The AH/MH little birds were lifted by, 1 C-5, 2 C-130 along with all support kits for the Battalion. Crews trained side by side with the 160th for all operational concepts. The 1-245 modified infantry night vision goggles and worked to develop the necessary skills for rapid deployment with little birds and C-130's.Durant and Hartov 2006, p. 57.

One of several motorcycle manufacturers in Birmingham, Velocette was a small, family-owned firm, selling almost as many hand-built motorcycles during its lifetime, as the mass-produced machines of the giant BSA and Norton concerns. Renowned for the quality of its products, the company was \\"always in the picture\\" in international motorcycle racing, from the mid-1920s through the 1950s, culminating in two World Championship titles (1949-1950 350 cc) and its legendary and still-unbeaten (for single-cylinder, 500 cc machines) 24 hours at over 100 mph (161 km/h) record. Veloce, while small, was a great technical innovator and many of its patented designs are commonplace on motorcycles today, including the positive-stop foot shift and swinging arm rear suspension with hydraulic dampers. The business suffered a gradual commercial decline during the late 1960s, eventually closing in February 1971. Foundation The company was founded by John Goodman (born Johannes G√ºtgemann and later known as John Taylor before formally changing his name to Goodman) and William Gue, as \\"Taylor, Gue Ltd.\\" in 1905. Its first motorcycle was the Veloce. Later that year, John Taylor set up Veloce Limited, to produce cycles and related products and services. Veloce Ltd initially produced four-stroke motorcycles, first with Belgian \\"Kelecom\\" engines, then an F-head design of their own, with an integral two-speed gearbox. Velocette two-strokes 1913 Velocette Model A The first two-stroke, built in 1913, was called a Velocette. When The 'K' series reverted to Veloce, the buying public overlooked them, having become used to the Velocette name and associating it with quality products. The Velocette name was reprised, and used for all subsequent models. John was joined in 1916 by his sons Percy and Eugene Goodman. Between 1913 and 1925, Veloce produced expensive, high-quality two- stroke motorcycles of (nominally) 250 cc, which gained an excellent reputation and were entered in competitions such as the Isle of Man TT, with some success. The single-cylinder machines had many advanced features, such as a throttle-controlled oil pump, which set them apart from other manufacturers' products. (The introduction of this device was claimed erroneously, much later, by Suzuki). The factory gradually developed this machine from the \\"A\\" series and variants (A, AC2 - coil ignition, two-speed gearbox, AC3 ‚Äì three- speed gearbox, etc.), then the \\"H\\" series, the model U and variants, culminating in the model GTP in 1930, which was produced until 1946. The GTP was a reliable lightweight motorcycle with good steering and power delivery. Velocette 'K' series In the early 1920s, Veloce realized that in order to grow as a company, it needed a new machine of advanced specification and developed an overhead camshaft (OHC) 350 cc engine, which became known as the 'K' series, introduced in 1925. After a year of teething troubles with this new design, Veloce entered slightly modified 'K' models into racing events such as the Isle of Man TT and Brooklands races, and the reliability and sweet running qualities of their new engine led to a long string of racing successes, and the introduction of a production racing model, the KTT, built between 1928 and 1949. The 1929 KTT was the first production motorcycle to feature positive-stop, foot-actuated gearchange. The roadster models developed from this initial model K were the Velocette KSS (super sports), KTS (touring sports), KTP (twin exhaust ports), KN (normal), and a few variations. A notable change in engine design was introduced in 1935, the 'KSS Mk2' with a fully enclosed aluminium cylinder head. The OHC engine series continued for roadsters until 1948, when the final KSS Mk.2 versions were produced, with rigid frames and Dowty air-sprung telescopic forks. Accurate valve timing was accomplished through the pioneering use of stroboscopic lamps. The 'K' series showed an excellent turn of speed and reliability and soon the factory developed racing models to compete in the Isle of Man TT. { Velocette KSS Mk II Velocette KTT Mk VIII 350 cc OHC Racer 1948 } Velocette 'M' series 1936 Velocette MAC Sport In 1933, the company decided to introduce a new line of overhead valve (OHV) machines, in order to cut production costs and make a more affordable motorcycle. The K series was expensive to produce, requiring selective hand assembly of the shaft-and-bevel camshaft drive; it was determined that a simpler OHV design would be quicker to build and require less skilled labour to assemble. The first of these new machines was the MOV, using a 250 cc engine of 'square' dimensions (68 mm bore and 68 mm stroke). It was an immediate sales success, having lively performance for the time (), and proved a reliable machine with excellent road manners. From this machine, by lengthening the stroke of the crankshaft, the Velocette MAC 350 cc was introduced in 1934. It proved even more popular than the MOV, and became a real money spinner for the company, bringing much needed capital into the firm. In 1935 an entirely new machine was introduced, based on the two previous OHV models, the Velocette MSS of 500 cc. A new, heavier frame was utilized with the intention that the machine could serve as a sidecar hauler. This new frame was developed from the mkV KTT racing machine, and was shared with the KSS MKII of 1936-1948\\\\. The MSS also proved very popular and profitable for Veloce. A 350 cc version of the MOV was the basis for the company's World War II military motorcycles. Post war 1953 Velocette LE After the Second World War, the company sought to capture what it saw as a developing need for personal transport and created the LE model (for \\"Little Engine\\"). This was a 149 cc water-cooled flat-twin with side valves, a pressed steel frame, telescopic forks and a swingarm. Velocette's Director, Eugene Goodman, planned an innovative and radical design that would appeal to a new market that needed cheap, clean and reliable transport. Designer Charles Udall developed the Velocette LE as a \\"conceived-as-a-whole\\" design, with engine, gearbox, drive shaft and bevel box in a single unit to do a specific job. It was sophisticated and expensive. It proved less successful than the firm had hoped and, although it became Veloce's best selling model ever, the high tooling costs for this all-new machine were barely recouped. It did see widespread adoption by British police forces for urban patrol. At the time Metropolitan Police Officers on foot patrol were required to salute inspectors. With the introduction of the motorcycle patrols this became dangerous, requiring the officer to take his hand off the handle bars, and so the rider was to allowed to show his respect with a smart nod. It has been suggested that this is how Velocette LEs became known as \\"Noddy Bikes\\". However, Noddy (the popular cartoon character created by British children's author Enid Blyton) who famously had frequent run-ins with the Policeman Mr. Plod, is also credited with being the origin. The market for sporting machines was still strong, and Velocette continued to produce the 348cc KTT for racing. At the 1947 Isle of Man TT the company won the first four places in the Junior race. In 1949 they were the first FIM 350cc World Champions, a feat which they repeated in 1950. In 1967 Neil Kelly won the first Isle of Man Production TT in the 500cc class on a Velocette Thruxton, with another Thruxton in second place.History of Velocette Classic Motor History Later models The 1954 499 cc Velocette MSS proved a successful export to the American desert racing scene, prompting the development of scrambler and enduro versions of the bike, the 349 cc Viper and 499 cc Venom, both introduced in 1956. A 1958 review in The Motor Cycle, an English weekly paper, called the Viper \\"a remarkably fine motorcycle, all round performance well above the average\\" and declared it capable of speeds over . In 1961 a Velocette Venom became the first motorcycle to cover over in a 24-hour period, at the banked, oval, Montlhery circuit in France with a team of eight riders including Veloce director Bertie Goodman and 'MotorCycling' staff writer Bruce Main-Smith, averaging . The Velocette Venom 1961 This record for up to 500cc capacity machines still stands to the present day. The machine still exists; although badly damaged in the disastrous fire at the National Motorcycle Museum in Birmingham, it was restored by Velocette Owners Club president Ivan Rhodes with assistance from club members. 1961 Velocette Viceroy In 1960, Velocette introduced the Viceroy, a very unusual 250 cc opposed twin two-stroke scooter. Unique to the Viceroy was the front-mounted twin-cylinder engine, and the fuel tank mounted under the front legshield. The engine itself was extremely compact, and connected to the rear-mounted clutch and transmission by a drive shaft from the engine-mounted flywheel. With electric start, 12-volt electrics, a very low centre of gravity, power over and a reported comfortable cruising speed of , performance, handling and features of the Viceroy were first class. The scooter came as market forces and rider preferences were changing, and the Viceroy was not a sales success. The late 1960s were the last years of production for Velocette motorcycles, production for the Velocette Viper and Vogue ending in 1968, \\"Special\\", Scrambler and Endurance in 1969, and MSS Venom and Velocette Thruxton in 1970. Veloce Ltd. closed in February 1971. Commercial failure The business had struggled since 1956, with government changes to hire purchase legislation and fuel rationing during the Suez Crisis. Major losses incurred on the Viceroy scooter development from 1956 to marketing in 1960, followed by costs incurred by overstocking of redundant parts and the loss of capital due to development costs invested in another new-model doomed to failure ‚Äì the Velocette Vogue, an updated LE with a full fibreglass touring body. Sales were quoted as \\"a few hundred over five years\\", and development costs were never recovered either by Veloce or Avon, the bodywork manufacturer.Shaping the Future, Part 2.

The business commercially failed in the late 1960s, although profits from spare-part sales after acquisition of the Royal Enfield spares operation in 1967 defrayed operational costs to such an extent that the company as a whole survived for another three years. The workforce was sacked in February 1971, with C C Cooper, a local metals-recovery dealer, buying most of the machinery and continuing to produce limited spare parts by a small team of engineers.

Its original meaning regarded duty in a broader sense than the related concept of fealty. Both derive from the Latin word fidƒìlis, meaning \\"faithful or loyal\\". In the City of London financial markets it has traditionally been used in the sense encompassed in the motto \\"My word is my bond\\".  Audio and electronics In audio, \\"fidelity\\" denotes how accurately a copy reproduces its source. In the 1950s, the terms \\"high fidelity\\" or \\"hi- fi\\" were popularized for equipment and recordings which exhibited more accurate sound reproduction. For example, a worn gramophone record will have a lower fidelity than one in good condition, and a recording made by a low budget record company in the early 20th century is likely to have significantly less audio fidelity than a good modern recording. Similarly in electronics, fidelity refers to the correspondence of the output signal to the input signal, rather than sound quality, as in the popular internet connection technology \\"Wi-Fi\\". The term \\"lo-fi\\" has existed since at least the 1950s, shortly after the acceptance of \\"hi-fi\\", but its definition evolved continuously between the 1970s and 2000s. In the 1976 edition of the Oxford Dictionary, lo-fi was added under the definition of \\"sound production less good in quality than 'hi-fi,'\\" and in the glossary of the 1977 book The Tuning of the World, was defined as \\"unfavourable signal-to-noise ratio.\\" in 2003, the Oxford Dictionary added a second definition for the term‚Äî\\"a genre of rock music characterized by minimal production, giving a raw and unsophisticated sound\\". A third was added in 2008: \\"unpolished, amateurish, or technologically unsophisticated, esp. as a deliberate aesthetic choice.\\"  Scientific modelling and simulation In the fields of scientific modelling and simulation, fidelity refers to the degree to which a model or simulation reproduces the state and behaviour of a real world object, feature or condition. Fidelity is therefore a measure of the realism of a model or simulation. Simulation fidelity has also been described in the past as \\"degree of similarity\\". In quantum mechanics and optics, the fidelity of a field is calculated as an overlap integral of the field of interest with a reference or target field. Program evaluation In the field of program evaluation, the term fidelity denotes how closely a set of procedures were implemented as they were supposed to have been. For example, it is difficult to draw conclusions from a study about formative assessment in school classrooms if the teachers are not able or willing to follow the procedures they received in training.

A frugivore is an animal that thrives mostly on raw fruits, succulent fruit-like vegetables, roots, shoots, nuts and seeds. Approximately 20% of mammalian herbivores eat fruit. Frugivores are highly dependent on the abundance and nutritional composition of fruits. Frugivores can benefit or hinder fruit- producing plants by either dispersing or destroying their seeds through digestion. When both the fruit-producing plant and the frugivore benefit by fruit-eating behavior the interaction is called mutualism. Frugivore seed dispersal Seed dispersal is important for plants because it allows their progeny to move away from their parents over time. The advantages of seed dispersal may have led to the evolution of fleshy fruits, which entice animals to consume them and move the plant's seeds from place to place. While many fruit-producing plant species would not disperse far without frugivores, their seeds can usually germinate even if they fall to the ground directly below their parent. Many types of animals are seed dispersers. Mammal and bird species represent the majority of seed-dispersing species. However, frugivorous tortoises, lizards, amphibians, and even fish also disperse seeds. For example, cassowaries are a keystone species because they spread fruit through digestion, many of the seeds of which will not grow unless they have been digested by the animal. While frugivores and fruit-producing plant species are present worldwide, there is some evidence that tropical forests have more frugivore seed dispersers than the temperate zones. =Ecological significance= Frugivore seed dispersal is a common phenomenon in many ecosystems. However, it is not a highly specific type of plant‚Äìanimal interaction. For example, a single species of frugivorous bird may disperse fruits from several species of plants, or a few species of bird may disperse seeds of one plant species. This lack of specialization could be because fruit availability varies by season and year, which tends to discourage frugivore animals from focusing on just one plant species. Furthermore, different seed dispersers tend to disperse seeds to different habitats, at different abundances, and distances, depending on their behavior and numbers. =Plant adaptations to attract dispersers= There are a number of fruit characteristics that seem to be adaptive characteristics to attract frugivores. Many animal-dispersed fruits advertise their palatability to animals with bright colors and attractive smells (mimetic fruits). Fruit pulp is generally rich in water and carbohydrates and low in protein and lipids. However, the exact nutritional composition of fruits varies widely. The seeds of animal-dispersed fruits are often adapted to survive digestion by frugivores. For example, seeds can become more permeable to water after passage through an animal's gut. This leads to higher germination rates. Some mistletoe seeds even germinate inside the disperser's intestine. Frugivore adaptations for fruit consumption Many seed-dispersing animals have specialized digestive systems to process fruits, which leave seeds intact. Some bird species have shorter intestines to rapidly pass seeds from fruits, while some frugivorous bat species have longer intestines. Some seed- dispersing frugivores have short gut-retention times, and others can alter intestinal enzyme composition when eating different types of fruits. Plant mechanisms to delay or deter frugivory Since plants invest considerable energy into fruit production, many have evolved to encourage mutualist frugivores to consume their fruit for seed dispersal. Some have also evolved mechanisms to decrease consumption of fruits when unripe and from non-seed- dispersing predators. Predators and parasites of fruit include seed predators, insects, and microbial frugivores. Plants have developed both chemical and physical adaptations: Physical deterrents: *Cryptic coloration (e.g. green fruits blend in with the plant leaves) *Unpalatable textures (e.g. thick skins made of anti-nutritive substances) *Resins and saps (e.g. prevent animals from swallowing) *Repellent substances, hard outer coats, spines, thorns Chemical deterrents: *Chemical deterrents in plants are called secondary metabolites. Secondary metabolites are compounds produced by the plant that are not essential for the primary processes, such as growth and reproduction. Toxins might have evolved to prevent consumption by animals that disperse seeds into unsuitable habitats, to prevent too many fruits from being eaten per feeding bout by preventing too many seeds being deposited in one site, or to prevent digestion of the seeds in the gut of the animal. Secondary chemical defenses are divided into three categories: nitrogen-based, carbon-based terpenes, and carbon-based phenolics. Examples of secondary chemical defenses in fruit: *Capsaicin is a carbon-based phenolic compound only found in plant genus Capsicum (chili and bell peppers). Capsaicin is responsible for the pungent, hot \\"flavor\\" of peppers and inhibits growth of microbes and invertebrates. *Cyanogenic glycosides are nitrogen-based compounds and are found in 130 plant families, but not necessarily in the fruit of all the plants. It is specifically found in the red berries of the genus Ilex (holly, an evergreen woody plant). It can inhibit electron transport, cellular respiration, induce vomiting, diarrhea, and mild narcosis in animals. *Emodin is a carbon-based phenolic compound in plants like rhubarb. Emodin can be cathartic or act as a laxative in humans, kills dipteran larvae, inhibits growth of bacteria and fungi, and deters consumption by birds and mice. * Starch is a polysaccharide that is slowly converted to fructose as the fruit ripens. Frugivorous animals Birds are a main focus of frugivory research. An article by Bette A. Loiselle and John G. Blake, \\"Potential Consequences of Extinction of Frugivorous Birds for Shrubs of a Tropical Wet Forest\\", discusses the important role frugivorous birds have on ecosystems. The conclusions of their research indicate how the extinction of seed-dispersing species could negatively affect seed removal, seed viability, and plant establishment. The article highlights the importance that seed-dispersing birds have on the deposition of plant species. Examples of seed-dispersing birds are the hornbill, the toucan, the aracari, the cotinga (ex. Guianan cock-of-the-rock), and some species of parrots. Frugivores are common in the temperate zone, but mostly found in the tropics. Many frugivorous birds feed mainly on fruits until nesting season, when they incorporate protein-rich insects into their diet. Facultatively-baccivorous birds may also eat bitter berries, such as juniper, in months when alternative foods are scarce. In North America, red mulberry (Morus rubra) fruits are widely sought after by birds in spring and early summer; as many as 31 species of birds recorded visiting a fruiting tree in Arkansas. Prior to 1980, most reports of avian frugivory were made in the tropics. From 1979‚Äì1981, a number of studies recognized the importance of fruits to fall temperate assemblages of passerine migrants. The earliest of these field studies were conducted in the fall of 1974 in upstate New York by Robert Rybczynski & Donald K. Riker and separately by John W. Baird in New Jersey, each documenting ingestion of fruits in stands of fruit-bearing shrubs by mixed species assemblages dominated by migrant white-throated sparrows. Mammals are considered frugivorous if the seed is dispersed and able to establish. One example of a mammalian frugivore is the maned wolf, or Chrysocyon brachyurus, which is found in South America. A study by Jos√© Carlos Motta-Junior and Karina Martins found that the maned wolf is probably an important seed disperser. The researchers found that 22.5‚Äì54.3% of the diet was fruit. 65% of the diet of orangutans consists of fruit. Orangutans primarily eat fruit, along with young leaves, bark, flowers, honey, insects, and vines. One of their preferred foods is the fruit of the durian tree, which tastes somewhat like sweet custard. Orangutans discard the skin, eat the flesh, and spit out the seeds. Other examples of mammalian frugivores include fruit bats and the gray-bellied night monkey, also known as the owl monkey: > \\"Owl monkeys are frugivores and supplement their diet with flowers, insects, > nectar, and leaves (Wright 1989; 1994). They prefer small, ripe fruit when > available and in order to find these, they forage in large-crown trees > (larger than ten meters [32.8 ft]) (Wright 1986). Seasonal availability of > fruit varies across environments. Aotus species in tropical forests eat more > fruit throughout the year because it is more readily available compared to > the dry forests where fruit is limited in the dry season and owl monkeys are > more dependent on leaves.\\" Conservation Since seed dispersal allows plant species to disperse to other areas, the loss of frugivores could change plant communities and lead to the local loss of particular plant species. Since frugivore seed dispersal is so important in the tropics, many researchers have studied the loss of frugivores and related it to changed plant population dynamics. Several studies have noted that even the loss of only large frugivores, such as monkeys, could have a negative effect, since they are responsible for certain types of long-distance seed dispersal that is not seen with other frugivore types, like birds. However, plant species whose seeds are dispersed by animals may be less vulnerable to fragmentation than other plant species. Frugivores can also benefit from the invasion of exotic fruit-producing species and can be vectors of exotic invasion by dispersing non-native seeds.

He was an early member of the Bourbaki group, and is known for his work on the differential geometry of smooth fiber bundles, notably the Ehresmann connection, the concept of jet bundles, and his seminar on category theory. Life Ehresmann was born in Strasbourg to a family which spoke the Alsatian language; his father was a gardener. He attended school in Strasbourg, then in 1924 went to university at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure (ENS) in Paris. On graduating in 1927 he did one year of military service, and taught at a French school at Rabat in Morocco. He studied further at the University of G√∂ttingen during the years 1930‚Äì31, and at Princeton University in 1932‚Äì34. He completed his Ph.D. thesis entitled Sur la topologie de certains espaces homog√®nes (On the topology of certain homogeneous spaces) at ENS in 1934 under the supervision of √âlie Cartan, and became a researcher with the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS). From 1935 to 1937 he contributed to the seminar of Gaston Julia, which was a forerunner of the Bourbaki seminar. Ehresmann was a lecturer at the French University of Strasbourg in 1939, when the German occupation of France irrupted and the whole faculty was evacuated to Clermont-Ferrand. When Germany withdrew in 1945, he returned to Strasbourg. From 1955 he was Professor of Topology in Paris. His post was initially at the Sorbonne, but after the reorganization of Parisian universities in 1969 he moved to Paris Diderot University (Paris 7). He also held visiting chairs at Yale University, Princeton University, in Brazil (S√£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro), Buenos Aires, Mexico City, Montreal, and the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Bombay; and was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by the University of Bologna. He was President of the Soci√©t√© Math√©matique de France in 1965. He retired in 1975. After retirement and until 1978 he gave lectures at the University of Picardy at Amiens, to which he moved because his second wife, Andr√©e Charles-Ehresmann, was a professor of mathematics there. He died at Amiens in 1979.  Mathematical work  Ehresmann first investigated the topology and homology of manifolds associated with classical Lie groups, such as Grassmann manifolds and other homogeneous spaces. He developed the concept of fiber bundle, building on work by Herbert Seifert and Hassler Whitney. Norman Steenrod was working in the same direction in the USA, but Ehresmann was particularly interested in differentiable (smooth) fiber bundles, and in differential-geometric aspects of these. He was a pioneer of differential topology. By 1957, having become a leading proponent of categorical methods, he founded the mathematical journal Cahiers de Topologie et G√©om√©trie Diff√©rentielle Cat√©goriques. Jean Dieudonn√© described Ehresmann's personality as \\"... distinguished by forthrightness, simplicity, and total absence of conceit or careerism. As a teacher he was outstanding, not so much for the brilliance of his lectures as for the inspiration and tireless guidance he generously gave to his research students ... \\" He had 76 PhD students, including Georges Reeb, Wu Wenjun (Âê¥Êñá‰øä), Andr√© Haefliger, Valentin Po√©naru, and Daniel Tanr√©. His first student was Jacques Feldbau.According to Mich√®le Audin. His publications include the books 1965 Cat√©gories et structures (Dunod, Paris, 1965) and Alg√®bre (1969). His collected works, edited by his wife, appeared in seven volumes in 1980‚Äì1983 (four volumes published by Imprimerie Evrard, Amiens, and the rest in the journal Cahiers de Topologie et G√©om√©trie Diff√©rentielle Cat√©goriques which he had founded).

The largest of those projects is the S√£o Luiz do Tapaj√≥s Dam, whose environmental licensing process has been suspended - not yet cancelled - by IBAMA due to its expected impacts on indigenous and river communities. It would flood a part of the area of the Sawr√© Muybu Indigenous Territory. Another is the planned 2,338 MW Jatob√° Hydroelectric Power Plant. A third dam, the controversial Chacor√£o Dam, would flood a large area of the Munduruku Indigenous Territory. The dams are part of a plan to convert the Tapajos into a waterway for barges to take soybeans from Mato Grosso to the Amazon River ports. A continuous chain of dams, with locks, would eliminate today's rapids and waterfalls.

Bidwell died. Annie continued to live there until her death in 1918. John Bidwell began construction of the mansion on his 26,000 acres (110 km¬≤) Rancho del Arroyo Chico in 1865, during his courtship of Annie Ellicott Kennedy. After their marriage in 1868, the three story, 26 room Victorian house became the social and cultural center of the upper Sacramento Valley. Now a museum and State Historic Park, it is California Historical Landmark #329 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The mansion was a $60,000 project, and was finished in May 1868.Chico: A 20th Century Pictoral History When constructed, Bidwell Mansion featured modern plumbing, gas lighting and water systems. The three-story brick structure is built in an informally romantic version of the Italianate style. It also has aspects of the Italian Villa and Octagon house types present. The building's exterior is finished with a pink tinted plaster. The first floor of the Bidwell Mansion is accessible via a ramp from the exterior of the Mansion. The interior of the entire mansion can be seen during an hour-long tour that starts on the hour most days of the week. A video is available in the visitor center for those who can not climb the 50 stairs to the 2nd and 3rd floors of the mansion. The Bidwell Mansion Visitor Center is completely accessible. There is a gift shop, museum, theater, and comfortable lobby. There are also restrooms and water. Trivia * Some of the interior scenes from The Thin Man were shot inside the mansion. * From 1925-1935, Bidwell Mansion was once again transformed into another entity when it served as a dormitory for Chico State Teachers College students. It is mentioned by local historians that the students studied and dressed in the rooms, but actually slept outside on the surrounding verandas. The mansion was later dubbed \\"Bidwell Hall\\" and housed the Art and Home Economics departments.

Samuel Foote acquired the lease in 1747, and in 1766 he gained a royal patent to play legitimate drama (meaning spoken drama, as opposed to opera, concerts or plays with music) in the summer months. The original building was a little further north in the same street. It has been at its current location since 1821, when it was redesigned by John Nash. It is a Grade I listed building, with a seating capacity of 888. The freehold of the theatre is owned by the Crown Estate.H M Land Registry registration NGL853225 The Haymarket has been the site of a significant innovation in theatre. In 1873, it was the venue for the first scheduled matin√©e performance, establishing a custom soon followed in theatres everywhere. Its managers have included Benjamin Nottingham Webster, John Baldwin Buckstone, Squire Bancroft, Cyril Maude, Herbert Beerbohm Tree, and John Sleeper Clarke, brother-in-law of John Wilkes Booth, who quit America after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Famous actors who d√©buted at the theatre included Robert William Elliston (1774‚Äì1831) and John Liston (1776‚Äì1846). History of the theatre =Origins and early years= Haymarket Theatre, ca. 1900 The First Haymarket Theatre or Little Theatre was built in 1720 by John Potter, carpenter, on the site of The King's Head Inn in the Haymarket and a shop in Suffolk Street kept by Isaac Bliburgh, a gunsmith, and known by the sign of the Cannon and Musket. It was the third public theatre opened in the West End. The theatre cost ¬£1000 to build, with a further ¬£500 expended on decorations, scenery and costumes. It opened on 29 December 1720, with a French play La Fille a la Morte, ou le Badeaut de Paris performed by a company later known as 'The French Comedians of His Grace the Duke of Montague'.Survey of London, p.98 Potter's speculation was known as The New French Theatre.'The Haymarket', Old and New London: Volume 4 (1878), pp. 216‚Äì26, accessed 31 March 2007 The theatre's first major success was a 1729 production of a play by Samuel Johnson of Cheshire, Hurlothrumbo, or The Supernatural, which ran for 30 nights ‚Äì not as long as John Gay's The Beggar's Opera (62 performances), but still a long run for the time.See the introduction here for some discussion of the play. In 1730, the theatre was taken over by an English company, and its name changed to the 'Little Theatre in the Haymarket'. Among the actors who appeared there before 1737 when the theatre was closed under the Licensing Act 1737 were Aaron Hill, Theophilus Cibber, and Henry Fielding. In the eight to ten years before the Act was passed, the Haymarket was an alternative to John Rich's Theatre Royal, Covent Garden and the opera-dominated Drury Lane Theatre. Fielding himself was responsible for the instigation of the Act, having produced a play called The Historical Register that parodied prime minister Robert Walpole, as the caricature, Quidam. Poet Laureate Colley Cibber, the first actor-manager In particular, it was an alternative to the pantomime and special-effects dominated stages, and it presented opposition (Tory party) satire. Henry Fielding staged his plays at the Haymarket, and so did Henry Carey. Hurlothrumbo was just one of his plays in that series of anti-Walpolean satires, followed by Tom Thumb. Another, in 1734, was his mock-opera, The Dragon of Wantley, with music by John Frederick Lampe. This work punctured the vacuous operatic conventions and pointed a satirical barb at Walpole and his taxation policies. The piece was a huge success, with a record-setting run of 69 performances in its first season. The work debuted at the Haymarket Theatre, where its coded attack on Walpole would have been clear, but its long run occurred after it moved to Covent Garden, which had a much greater capacity for staging. The burlesque itself is very brief on the page, as it relied extensively on absurd theatrics, dances, and other non-textual entertainments. The Musical Entertainer from 1739 contains engravings showing how the staging was performed.Gillespie, Norman. \\"Henry Carey\\", in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians. vol. 15, p. 128. Carey continued with Pasquin and others. Additionally, refugees from Drury Lane's and Covent Garden's internal struggles would show up at the Haymarket, and thus Charlotte Charke would act there in a parody of her father, Colley Cibber, one of the owners and managers of Drury Lane. The Theatrical Licensing Act, however, put an end to the anti-ministry satires, and it all but entirely shut down the theatre. From 1741 to 1747, Charles Macklin, Cibber, Samuel Foote, and others sometimes produced plays there either by use of a temporary licence or by subterfuge; one advertisement runs, \\"At Cibber's Academy in the Haymarket, will be a Concert, after which, will be exhibited (gratis) a Rehearsal, in the form of a Play, called Romeo and Juliet.\\" In 1749 a hoaxer billed as The Bottle Conjuror was advertised to appear at the theatre. The conjuror's publicity claimed that, while on stage, he would place his body inside an empty wine bottle, in full view of the audience. When the advertised act failed to appear on stage, the audience rioted and gutted the theatre. Although the identity of the hoax's perpetrator is unknown, several authors consider John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu, to have been responsible.Ryan, Richard Ryan and Fran√ßois Joseph Talma. Dramatic Table Talk or, Scenes, Situations, & Adventures, Serious & Comic in Theatrical History and Biography, Vol III. John Knight & Henry Lacey (1830), p. 69, Google Books =London's third patent theatre= Samuel Foote In 1754, John Potter, who had been rated (i.e. paid property tax) for the theatre since its opening, was succeeded by John Whitehead. In 1758 Theophilus Cibber obtained from William Howard, then the Lord Chamberlain, a general licence under which Foote tried to establish the Haymarket as a regular theatre. With the aid of the Duke of York he procured a royal licence to exhibit plays during four months in each year from May to September during his lifetime. He also bought the lease of the theatre from Potter's executors and, having added to the site by purchasing adjoining property, he enlarged and improved the building which he opened on 14 May 1767, as the Theatre Royal, the third patent theatre in London.Survey of London, p.99 Several successful seasons followed, with Foote producing numerous plays at the theatre, but Foote finally got himself into difficulties by his custom of caricaturing well-known persons on the stage and this, combined with increasing ill-health, resulted in his selling both the theatre and patent to George Colman, Sr. on 16 January 1777. During the season of 1793‚Äì94 when Drury Lane Theatre was being rebuilt, the Haymarket was opened under the Drury Lane Patent. The season was notable for a 'Dreadful Accident' which occurred on 3 February 1794, 'when Twenty Persons unfortunately lost their lives, and a great Number were dreadfully bruised owing to a great Crowd pressing to see his Majesty, who was that Evening present at the Performance.' Amongst the dead were John Charles Brooke, Somerset Herald and Benjamin Pingo York Herald. Colman died in 1794, and the theatre descended to his son. George Colman Jr., though successful both as playwright and manager, dissipated his gains by his extravagance. For a time he lived in a room at the back of the theatre and he was finally forced to sell shares in the latter to his brother-in-law, David Morris. Monetary difficulties increased and for a while Colman managed the theatre from the King's Bench Prison, where he was confined for debt. All the buildings on the east of the Haymarket from the theatre southward were rebuilt circa 1820 in connection with John Nash's schemes for the improvement of the neighbourhood. Nash persuaded the proprietors of the theatre to rebuild on a site a little south of the old one so that the portico should close the vista from Charles Street. The main front feature of Nash's elevation in the Haymarket was (and is) a pedimented portico of six Corinthian columns which extends in depth to the edge of the pavement and includes the whole frontage. It is sometimes stated that Nash rebuilt the theatre entirely, but there is evidence that he incorporated a house in Little Suffolk Street with the theatre, removed two shops which were in front, in the Haymarket, built a portico, increased the number of avenues and added a second gallery to the existing auditorium. A lease dated 10 June 1821, was granted to David Edward Morris. The theatre was opened on 4 July 1821, with The Rivals. Benjamin Nottingham Webster became the theatre's manager from 1837 to 1853. He and his successor, John Baldwin Buckstone, established the theatre as a great comedy house, and the theatre hosted most of the great actors of the period. The illusionist Ching Lau Lauro performed here on 25 July 1827.\\"Theatre Royal, Haymarket\\", The Times, Wednesday, 25 July 1827; p. 2; Issue 13340 =The latter half of the 19th century= Scene from 300px In 1862, the theatre was host to a 400-night run of Our American Cousin, with Edward Sothern as Lord Dundreary. The play's success brought the word \\"dreary\\" into common use. Robertson's David Garrick was a hit in 1864, also with Sothern in the title role. Sothern also starred in H. J. Byron's An English Gentleman at the theatre in 1871.The Times, 2 May 1871, p. 12 W. S. Gilbert premiered seven of his plays at the Haymarket. The first was his early burlesque, Robinson Crusoe; or, The Injun Bride and the Injured Wife (1867, written with Byron, Tom Hood, H. S. Leigh and Arthur Sketchley). Gilbert followed this with a number of his blank verse \\"fairy comedies\\", the first of which was The Palace of Truth (1870), produced by Buckstone. These starred William Hunter Kendal and his wife Madge Robertson Kendal and also included Pygmalion and Galatea (1871), and The Wicked World (1873). Gilbert also produced here his dramas, Charity (1874), Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith (1876), and his most famous play outside of his Savoy Operas, Engaged, an 1877 farce.Ainger, p. 134 Buckstone's ghost has reportedly often been seen at the theatre, particularly during comedies and \\"when he appreciates things\\" playing there.Adams, Stephen. \\"Patrick Stewart saw ghost performing Waiting for Godot\\", The Daily Telegraph, 25 August 2009 In 2009, The Daily Telegraph reported that the actor Patrick Stewart saw the ghost standing in the wings during a performance of Waiting for Godot at the Haymarket. In May 1875, Arthur Sullivan's The Zoo transferred to the Haymarket.Bond, Ian. \\"The Zoo: Introduction\\", the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 18 August 2011, accessed 1 September 2020 250px In 1879 the house was taken over by the Bancrofts, who re-opened the theatre with a revival of Edward Bulwer-Lytton's Money, followed by Victorien Sardou's Odette (for which they engaged Madame Helena Modjeska) and Fedora, and Arthur Wing Pinero's Lords and Commons, with other revivals of previous successes. The auditorium had been reconstructed, and the stage enclosed in a complete picture frame proscenium, the first in London. The abolition of the pit by the introduction of stalls seating divided by plain iron arms caused the opening night play, Money, on 31 January 1880, to be delayed for half an hour while the audience in the galleries expressed their anger. Mr. Bancroft, in the character of Sir Frederick Blount, vainly endeavoured to pacify them, until he bluntly asked whether the play should proceed and thus obtained silence. The Bancrofts gave up management of the theatre in 1885. The next season opened in September 1985. Herbert Beerbohm Tree became manager of the theatre and, in 1887, transferred The Red Lamp there from the Comedy Theatre; by then he had installed electric light in the theatre. Under Tree's management, Oscar Wilde premiered his comedy A Woman of No Importance in April 1893. In January 1895 Wilde's An Ideal Husband was first performed at the theatre. Tree's next notable hit was George du Maurier's Trilby, later in 1895. This ran for over 260 performances and made such profits that Tree was able to build Her Majesty's Theatre and establish RADA. In 1896 Cyril Maude and Frederick Harrison became lessees, opening with Under the Red Robe, an adaptation of Stanley Wyman's novel. In 1897 The Little Minister by J. M. Barrie ran for 320 performances.Foulkes, Richard. Lewis Carroll and the Victorian Stage: Theatricals in a Quiet Life, Routledge (2017), p. 211, =The 20th century= 1900 to 1950 The Haymarket's managers Frederick Harrison (who was sole lessee) and Cyril Maude remained through the first year of the 20th century. In 1904, the auditorium was redesigned in Louis XVI style by C. Stanley Peach.English Heritage listing details, accessed 28 April 2007 The following year, Maude acquired the Playhouse Theatre by Charing Cross Station, leaving Harrison in sole control. In 1909, Herbert Trench produced Maurice Maeterlinck's The Blue Bird. Productions from then to the end of World War I included Bunty Pulls the Strings (1911), a Scottish comedy by Graham Moffat, which ran for 617 performances with Jimmy Finlayson in the lead; Ibsen's Ghosts (1914); Elegant Edward, with Henry Daniell as P.

His presentations included 632 performances of The First Mrs Fraser, by St. John Ervine, starring Marie Tempest in 1929. In 1939, under Watson's management, work began on excavating a stalls bar, but it was not completed until 1941 owing to the outbreak of World War II.

It is notable for the Jedwabne pogrom of 10 July 1941, during the World War II German occupation of Poland.  History  Jedwabne synagogue destroyed in a 1913 accidental fire First mentioned in 1455 records, on 17 July 1736 Jedwabne received city rights from Poland's King August III, including the privilege of holding weekly Sunday markets and five country fairs a year. A wooden Catholic church with two steeples was built in 1737‚Äì1738, and a synagogue around 1770. The Jedwabne synagogue was a fine example of the unique Polish Jewish architectural tradition of wooden synagogues.Maria and Kazimierz Piechotka, Heaven's Gate: Wooden Synagogues in the Territory of the Former Plish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Institute of Art, Polish Academy of Sciences, Wydawnnictwo Krupski I S-ka, Warsaw, 2004, pp. 231-32. At the end of the 18th century, new textile factories opened. In 1851 there were as many as 17 weaving establishments employing 36 workers in the town. In terms of its cloth production, Jedwabne was already the eleventh-largest manufacturing centre in the Kingdom of Poland. By 1862, 11 mechanical and 13 manual weaving machines had been installed at Jedwabne. The town's cloth production fell into decline only after the January Uprising of 1863, due to Russian repression against Polish and Jewish entrepreneurs. The town was the center of a large Jewish community with a population in 1900 of 1,941.JewishGen.org =Soviet occupation= Following the Soviet invasion of eastern Poland in World War II in fulfillment of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, between 1939 and 1941 the Soviet NKVD conducted anti-Polish repression. It was preceded by a successful Soviet attack against a Polish partisan unit stationed in the Kobielne Wilderness. In 1940 the town had 3,985 residents: 3,670 Poles, 250 Jews, and 65 Belarusians. D.

The NKVD arrested a number of Poles and their families and deported them to Siberia. The NKVD arrested and killed Parson Ryszard Marian Szumowski. =German occupation= Jedwabne pogrom In September 1939 following the Invasion of Poland, Jedwabne was briefly occupied by German troops who deported some 300 men to labor camps prior to transferring the area to the Soviets. On 23 June 1941, as part of Operation Barbarossa, German troops reoccupied Jedwabne. Jewish refugees from Wizna and Radzi≈Ç√≥w, where on 7 July Jews were burned alive in a barn, took refuge in Jedwabne.The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos, 1933‚Äì1945, Geoffrey P. Megargee, Martin C. Dean, and Mel Hecker, Volume II, part A, pp. 899-902. Memorial in Jedwabne On 10 July 1941, the town's Jews were forced to assemble in the town square; the Germans played a passive role in the subsequent violence. A group of Polish men humiliated and killed some of the assembled Jews. Some 50 to 70 Jews were forced to tear down the statue of Lenin and place the pieces in a barn, after which they were beaten to death. The Polish men then marched the rest of the Jews into the barn and set it alight. Casualty estimates vary; a forensic investigation in 2002 set the number at 340 dead, while other estimates range as high as 2,000. Accounts differ as well as to the number of survivors of the massacre (between 125 and 302). Some 12 of the Polish perpetrators were convicted in 1949, receiving prison sentences of eight to fifteen years. Following the massacre, some of the surviving Jews were interned in the Jedwabne ghetto; one to three months later, the ghetto was dissolved and the inmates expelled to the ≈Åom≈ºa Ghetto. From there, on 2 November 1942, they were transferred to the Zambr√≥w transit camp; and from there, in January 1943, to the Auschwitz extermination camp. Some Jedwabne Jews managed to flee the ghetto liquidations, and some of them survived the war. In the early 20th century, many Jedwabne residents had emigrated to the United States. Landing and settling in New York City, they built the synagogue Congregation Anshe Yedwabne at 242 Henry Street in the Lower East Side.Yedwabne Yizkor Book, Radzilow Economy Jedwabne is the administrative and economic centre for the surrounding gmina, which has an agricultural character. It offers educational and healthcare services for the community, as well as administrative support, business infrastructure, and investment financing. The town is flanked by the Biebrza National Park, the biggest complex of natural marshes in Central Europe; it is inhabited by moose as well as other animals and bird species, attracting numerous tourists. The Biebrza river nearby is surrounded by campgrounds for fishing, hiking, and mountain biking.

He worked mainly in abstract algebra, but made important contributions to number theory. He was the founder of modular representation theory. Education and career Alfred Brauer was Richard's brother and seven years older. They were born to a Jewish family. Both were interested in science and mathematics, but Alfred was injured in combat in World War I. As a boy, Richard dreamt of becoming an inventor, and in February 1919 enrolled in Technische Hochschule Berlin-Charlottenburg. He soon transferred to University of Berlin. Except for the summer of 1920 when he studied at University of Freiburg, he studied in Berlin, being awarded his Ph.D. on 16 March 1926. Issai Schur conducted a seminar and posed a problem in 1921 that Alfred and Richard worked on together, and published a result. The problem also was solved by Heinz Hopf at the same time. Richard wrote his thesis under Schur, providing an algebraic approach to irreducible, continuous, finite-dimensional representations of real orthogonal (rotation) groups. Ilse Karger also studied mathematics at the University of Berlin; she and Richard were married 17 September 1925. Their sons George Ulrich (born 1927) and Fred Gunther (born 1932) also became mathematicians. Brauer began his teaching career in K√∂nigsberg (now Kaliningrad) working as Konrad Knopp‚Äôs assistant. Brauer expounded central division algebras over a perfect field while in K√∂nigsberg; the isomorphism classes of such algebras form the elements of the Brauer group he introduced. When the Nazi Party took over in 1933, the Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced Foreign Scholars took action to help Brauer and other Jewish scientists. Brauer was offered an assistant professorship at University of Kentucky. Richard accepted the offer, and by the end of 1933 he was in Lexington, Kentucky, teaching in English. Ilse followed the next year with George and Fred; brother Alfred made it to the United States in 1939, but their sister Alice was killed in the Holocaust. Hermann Weyl invited Richard to assist him at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study in 1934. Richard and Nathan Jacobson edited Weyl's lectures Structure and Representation of Continuous Groups. Through the influence of Emmy Noether, Richard was invited to University of Toronto to take up a faculty position. With his graduate student Cecil J. Nesbitt he developed modular representation theory, published in 1937. Robert Steinberg, Stephen Arthur Jennings, and Ralph Stanton were also Brauer‚Äôs students in Toronto. Brauer also conducted international research with Tadasi Nakayama on representations of algebras. In 1941 University of Wisconsin hosted visiting professor Brauer. The following year he visited the Institute for Advanced Study and Bloomington, Indiana where Emil Artin was teaching. In 1948 Richard and Ilse moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan where he and Robert M. Thrall contributed to the program in modern algebra at University of Michigan. With his graduate student K. A. Fowler, Brauer proved the Brauer‚ÄìFowler theorem. Donald John Lewis was another of his students at University of Michigan. In 1952 Brauer joined the faculty of Harvard University. Before retiring in 1971 he taught aspiring mathematicians such as Donald Passman and I. Martin Isaacs. The Brauers frequently traveled to see their friends such as Reinhold Baer, Werner Wolfgang Rogosinski, and Carl Ludwig Siegel. Mathematical work Several theorems bear his name, including Brauer's induction theorem, which has applications in number theory as well as finite group theory, and its corollary Brauer's characterization of characters, which is central to the theory of group characters. The Brauer-Fowler theorem, published in 1956, later provided significant impetus towards the classification of finite simple groups, for it implied that there could only be finitely many finite simple groups for which the centralizer of an involution (element of order 2) had a specified structure. Brauer applied modular representation theory to obtain subtle information about group characters, particularly via his three main theorems. These methods were particularly useful in the classification of finite simple groups with low rank Sylow 2-subgroups. The Brauer-Suzuki theorem showed that no finite simple group could have a generalized quaternion Sylow 2-subgroup, and the Alperin-Brauer-Gorenstein theorem classified finite groups with wreathed or quasidihedral Sylow 2-subgroups. The methods developed by Brauer were also instrumental in contributions by others to the classification program: for example, the Gorenstein‚ÄìWalter theorem, classifying finite groups with a dihedral Sylow 2-subgroup, and Glauberman's Z* theorem. The theory of a block with a cyclic defect group, first worked out by Brauer in the case when the principal block has defect group of order p, and later worked out in full generality by E. C. Dade, also had several applications to group theory, for example to finite groups of matrices over the complex numbers in small dimension. The Brauer tree is a combinatorial object associated to a block with cyclic defect group which encodes much information about the structure of the block. In 1970, he was awarded the National Medal of Science. Hypercomplex numbers Eduard Study had written an article on hypercomplex numbers for Klein's encyclopedia in 1898. This article was expanded for the French language edition by Henri Cartan in 1908. By the 1930s there was evident need to update Study‚Äôs article, and Richard Brauer was commissioned to write on the topic for the project. As it turned out, when Brauer had his manuscript prepared in Toronto in 1936, though it was accepted for publication, politics and war intervened. Nevertheless, Brauer kept his manuscript through the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, and in 1979 it was published by Okayama University in Japan. It also appeared posthumously as paper #22 in the first volume of his Collected Papers. His title was \\"Algebra der hyperkomplexen Zahlensysteme (Algebren)\\". Unlike the articles by Study and Cartan, which were exploratory, Brauer‚Äôs article reads as a modern abstract algebra text with its universal coverage. Consider his introduction: :In the beginning of the 19th century, the usual complex numbers and their introduction through computations with number-pairs or points in the plane, became a general tool of mathematicians. Naturally the question arose whether or not a similar \\"hypercomplex\\" number can be defined using points of n-dimensional space. As it turns out, such extension of the system of real numbers requires the concession of some of the usual axioms (Weierstrass 1863). The selection of rules of computation, which cannot be avoided in hypercomplex numbers, naturally allows some choice. Yet in any cases set out, the resulting number systems allow a unique theory with regard to their structural properties and their classification. Further, one desires that these theories stand in close connection with other areas of mathematics, wherewith the possibility of their applications is given. While still in K√∂nigsberg in 1929, Brauer published an article in Mathematische Zeitschrift \\"√úber Systeme hyperkomplexer Zahlen\\" which was primarily concerned with integral domains (Nullteilerfrei systeme) and the field theory which he used later in Toronto.

Biography  Carmichael was born in Goodwater, Alabama. He attended Lineville College, briefly, and he earned his bachelor's degree in 1898, while he was studying towards his Ph.D. degree at Princeton University. Carmichael completed the requirements for his Ph.D. in mathematics in 1911. Carmichael's Ph.D. research in mathematics was done under the guidance of the noted American mathematician G. David Birkhoff, and it is considered to be the first significant American contribution to the knowledge of differential equations in mathematics. Carmichael next taught at Indiana University from 1911 to 1915. Then he moved on to the University of Illinois, where he remained from 1915 until his retirement in 1947. Carmichael is known for his research in what are now called the Carmichael numbers (a subset of Fermat pseudoprimes, numbers satisfying properties of primes described by Fermat's Little Theorem although they are not primes), Carmichael's totient function conjecture, Carmichael's theorem, and the Carmichael function, all significant in number theory and in the study of the prime numbers. He found the smallest Carmichael number, 561, and over 50 years later, it was proven that there are infinitely many of them. Carmichael also described the Steiner system S(5,8,24) in his 1931 paper Tactical Configurations of Rank 2 and his 1937 book Introduction to the Theory of Groups of Finite Order, but the structure is often named after Ernst Witt, who rediscovered it in 1938.

The following year, he got a mathematics chair at the University of Palermo, which he kept until 1891. He settled in Rome, where he stayed as a professor at the Sapienza University until his accidental death, while trying to rescue his youngest son Manlio from drowning.

He introduced fundamental concepts of differential geometry, opening the way for the development of tensor calculus, which would later provide the mathematical basis for general relativity. Life Christoffel was born on 10 November 1829 in Montjoie (now Monschau) in Prussia in a family of cloth merchants. He was initially educated at home in languages and mathematics, then attended the Jesuit Gymnasium and the Friedrich-Wilhelms Gymnasium in Cologne. In 1850 he went to the University of Berlin, where he studied mathematics with Gustav Dirichlet (which had a strong influence over him) among others, as well as attending courses in physics and chemistry. He received his doctorate in Berlin in 1856 for a thesis on the motion of electricity in homogeneous bodies written under the supervision of Martin Ohm, Ernst Kummer and Heinrich Gustav Magnus. After receiving his doctorate, Christoffel returned to Montjoie where he spent the following three years in isolation from the academic community. However, he continued to study mathematics (especially mathematical physics) from books by Bernhard Riemann, Dirichlet and Augustin-Louis Cauchy. He also continued his research, publishing two papers in differential geometry. In 1859 Christoffel returned to Berlin, earning his habilitation and becoming a Privatdozent at the University of Berlin. In 1862 he was appointed to a chair at the Polytechnic School in Z√ºrich left vacant by Dedekind. He organised a new institute of mathematics at the young institution (it had been established only seven years earlier) that was highly appreciated. He also continued to publish research, and in 1868 he was elected a corresponding member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences and of the Istituto Lombardo in Milan. In 1869 Christoffel returned to Berlin as a professor at the Gewerbeakademie (now part of the Technical University of Berlin), with Hermann Schwarz succeeding him in Z√ºrich. However, strong competition from the close proximity to the University of Berlin meant that the Gewerbeakademie could not attract enough students to sustain advanced mathematical courses and Christoffel left Berlin again after three years. In 1872 Christoffel became a professor at the University of Strasbourg, a centuries-old institution that was being reorganized into a modern university after Prussia's annexation of Alsace-Lorraine in the Franco-Prussian War. Christoffel, together with his colleague Theodor Reye, built a reputable mathematics department at Strasbourg. He continued to publish research and had several doctoral students including Rikitaro Fujisawa, Ludwig Maurer and Paul Epstein. Christoffel retired from the University of Strasbourg in 1894, being succeeded by Heinrich Weber. After retirement he continued to work and publish, with the last treatise finished just before his death and published posthumously. Christoffel died on 15 March 1900 in Strasbourg. He never married and left no family. Work =Differential geometry= Christoffel is mainly remembered for his seminal contributions to differential geometry. In a famous 1869 paper on the equivalence problem for differential forms in n variables, published in Crelle's Journal, he introduced the fundamental technique later called covariant differentiation and used it to define the Riemann‚ÄìChristoffel tensor (the most common method used to express the curvature of Riemannian manifolds). In the same paper he introduced the Christoffel symbols \\\\Gamma_{kij} and \\\\Gamma^{k}_{ij} which express the components of the Levi-Civita connection with respect to a system of local coordinates. Christoffel's ideas were generalized and greatly developed by Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro and his student Tullio Levi-Civita, who turned them into the concept of tensors and the absolute differential calculus. The absolute differential calculus, later named tensor calculus, forms the mathematical basis of the general theory of relativity. =Complex analysis= Christoffel contributed to complex analysis, where the Schwarz‚ÄìChristoffel mapping is the first nontrivial constructive application of the Riemann mapping theorem. The Schwarz‚ÄìChristoffel mapping has many applications to the theory of elliptic functions and to areas of physics. In the field of elliptic functions he also published results concerning abelian integrals and theta functions. =Numerical analysis= Christoffel generalized the Gaussian quadrature method for integration and, in connection to this, he also introduced the Christoffel‚ÄìDarboux formula for Legendre polynomials (he later also published the formula for general orthogonal polynomials). =Other research= Christoffel also worked on potential theory and the theory of differential equations, however much of his research in these areas went unnoticed. He published two papers on the propagation of discontinuities in the solutions of partial differential equations which represent pioneering work in the theory of shock waves. He also studied physics and published research in optics, however his contributions here quickly lost their utility with the abandonment of the concept of the luminiferous aether. Honours Christoffel was elected as a corresponding member of several academies: * Prussian Academy of Sciences (1868) * Istituto Lombardo (1868) * G√∂ttingen Academy of Sciences (1869) Christoffel was also awarded two distinctions for his activity by the Kingdom of Prussia: * Order of the Red Eagle 3rd Class with bow (Schleife) (1893) * Order of the Crown 2nd Class (1895) Selected publications Notes References * P.L.

A simple polygon that is not convex is called concave,. non-convex or reentrant..

Young people mingle at the Bo√Æte 2005 nightclub in Niamey city centre, 2005. Traditional pottery from Boubon, a village close to the capital Niamey. The culture of Niger is marked by variation, evidence of the cultural crossroads which French colonialism formed into a unified state from the beginning of the 20th century. What is now Niger was created from four distinct cultural areas in the pre-colonial era: the Djerma dominated Niger River valley in the southwest; the northern periphery of Hausaland, made mostly of those states which had resisted the Sokoto Caliphate, and ranged along the long southern border with Nigeria; the Lake Chad basin and Kaouar in the far east, populated by Kanuri farmers and Toubou pastoralists who had once been part of the Kanem- Bornu Empire; and the Tuareg nomads of the A√Ør Mountains and Saharan desert in the vast north. Each of these communities, along with smaller ethnic groups like the pastoral Wodaabe Fula, brought their own cultural traditions to the new state of Niger. In religion, Islam, spread from North Africa beginning in the 10th century, has greatly shaped the mores of the people of Niger. Since Independence, greater interest has been in the country's cultural heritage, particularly with respect to traditional architecture, hand crafts, dances and music. Music of Niger includes the guitar music of the Tuaregs of Agadez as performed by Group Inerane, Group Bombino and others.  National culture  While successive post-BA governments have tried to forge a shared national culture, this has been slow forming, in part because the major Nigerien communities have their own cultural histories, and in part because Nigerian ethnic groups such as the Hausa, Tuareg and Kanuri are but part of larger ethnic communities which cross borders introduced under colonialism. Until the 1990s, government and politics was inordinately dominated by Niamey and the Djerma people of the surrounding region. The French had promoted Djerma royalty under their rule. After having first placed their capital in the powerful pre-colonial Hausa state at Zinder, the French moved their administration to what was a small village at Niamey, in part from fear of pan-Hausa power or British imperial designs on southern Niger. This governmental focus on the southwest continued after independence, with political representation reverting to a tiny traditional and educated elite.See Finn Fuglestad. A History of Niger: 1850-1954. Fuglestad argues that continuity was more important than change in the colonial period, and that Niger was never effectively governed by the French. When independence came, Fluglestad says this came from the pressure of outside forces (other colonies, world events) not the pressure of a modern political class, which in the 1950s simply did not exist in Niger. Despite this, only the Tuareg and Toubou pastoralists in the sparsely populated north and east have generated movements for autonomy, culminating in rebellions in 1963, the 1990s, and 2007. Islam, practiced by almost the entire population forms an important link between Nigerien communities, as does a shared post-independence history, national symbols, and festivals. See also: National symbols of Niger and Public holidays in Niger  Arts  = Festivals =  Religion  Islam is the dominant religion in Niger, and is practiced by more than 99% of the population.International Religious Freedom Report 2007: Niger. United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor (September 14, 2007). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Approximately 95% of Muslims are Sunni; 5% are Shi'a. There are small Christian, Bah√° º√≠, and Animist communities, the first largely a remnant of French colonial influence. Animist beliefs include both animist based festivals and traditions (such as the Bori cult), practiced by some syncretic Muslim communities, as opposed to several small communities who maintain their pre-Islamic religion. These include the Hausa speaking Maouri/Azna community in Dogondoutci in the south-southwest, the Kanuri speaking Manga near Zinder, and some tiny Boudouma and Songhay communities in the southwest.Samuel Decalo (1979) pp. 156-7, 193-4.  Languages  While French has been the cross cultural language of choice since independence, there are eight other official languages spoken in Niger, which include Hausa, Zarma/Songhai, Tamajeq, Fulfulde, Kanuri, Arabic, Gurmantche, and Toubou. Hausa, which almost half the population speak, has come to rival French as most used across communities. Literature  Cuisine   Sport  While traditional sports like horse racing, camel racing, and sorro wrestling survive, world sports like football dominate in urban areas. In the 1972 Summer Olympics, boxer Issake Dabore won a bronze medal, and Niger has sent athletes to all Summer Olympic Games held since 1964, except for 1976 and 1980.

Dryopteris ,Sunset Western Garden Book, 1995:606‚Äì607 commonly called the wood ferns, male ferns (referring in particular to Dryopteris filix-mas), or buckler ferns, is a fern genus in the family Dryopteridaceae, subfamily Dryopteridoideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). There are about 300-400 species in the genus. The species are distributed in Asia, the Americas, Europe, Africa, and the Pacific islands, with the highest diversity in eastern Asia. It is placed in the family Dryopteridaceae, subfamily Dryopteridoideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). Many of the species have stout, slowly creeping rootstocks that form a crown, with a vase-like ring of fronds. The sori are round, with a peltate indusium. The stipes have prominent scales. Hybridization and polyploidy are well-known phenomena in this group, with many species formed via these processes. The North American Dryopteris hybrid complex is a well-known example of speciation via allopolyploid hybridization. Selected species The genus has a large number of species. The PPG I classification suggested there were about 400 species; , the Checklist of Ferns and Lycophytes of the World listed 328 species and 83 hybrids. Some genera sunk into Dryopteris, such as Dryopsis, Stenolepia and Nothoperanema, are distinguished by other sources. *Dryopteris abbreviata *Dryopteris aemula ‚Äì hay-scented buckler fern *Dryopteris affinis ‚Äì scaly male fern *Dryopteris alpestris *Dryopteris amurensis *Dryopteris apicisora *Dryopteris arguta ‚Äì coastal wood fern *Dryopteris azorica *Dryopteris backeri *Dryopteris barbigera *Dryopteris bissetiana *Dryopteris blandfordii *Dryopteris bodinieri *Dryopteris borreri *Dryopteris cambrensis ‚Äì narrow male fern *Dryopteris campyloptera ‚Äì mountain wood fern *Dryopteris canaliculata *Dryopteris carthusiana ‚Äì narrow buckler fern *Dryopteris caucasica *Dryopteris caudifrons *Dryopteris celsa ‚Äì log fern *Dryopteris championii *Dryopteris changii *Dryopteris chapaensis *Dryopteris chinensis *Dryopteris chrysocoma *Dryopteris cinnamomea ‚Äì cinnamon wood fern *Dryopteris clintoniana ‚Äì Clinton's wood fern *Dryopteris confertipinna *Dryopteris cordipinna *Dryopteris corleyi *Dryopteris costalisora *Dryopteris crassirhizoma *Dryopteris crinalis *Dryopteris crispifolia *Dryopteris cristata ‚Äì crested buckler fern *Dryopteris cyatheoides *Dryopteris cycadina *Dryopteris cyclopeltiformis *Dryopteris decipiens *Dryopteris dehuaensis *Dryopteris dickinsii *Dryopteris dilatata ‚Äì broad buckler fern *Dryopteris discrita *Dryopteris enneaphylla *Dryopteris erythrosa *Dryopteris erythrosora ‚Äì autumn fern *Dryopteris expansa ‚Äì northern buckler fern *Dryopteris fibrilosa *Dryopteris fibrilosissima *Dryopteris filix-mas ‚Äì male fern *Dryopteris floridana *Dryopteris formosana *Dryopteris fragrans ‚Äì fragrant buckler fern, fragrant wood fern *Dryopteris fructuosa *Dryopteris fuscipes *Dryopteris gamblei *Dryopteris goerigiana *Dryopteris goldieana ‚Äì Goldie's wood fern *Dryopteris gongboensis *Dryopteris guanchica *Dryopteris gushanica *Dryopteris gushiangensis *Dryopteris gymnophylla *Dryopteris gymnosora *Dryopteris hasseltii *Dryopteris hendersoni *Dryopteris hirtipes *Dryopteris huanganshanensis *Dryopteris hupehensis *Dryopteris hwangii *Dryopteris hypophlebia *Dryopteris immixta *Dryopteris inaequalis *Dryopteris incisolobata *Dryopteris integriloba *Dryopteris integripinnula *Dryopteris intermedia ‚Äì intermediate wood fern *Dryopteris junlianensis *Dryopteris juxtaposita *Dryopteris kinkiensis *Dryopteris labordei *Dryopteris lacera *Dryopteris lancipinnula *Dryopteris lepidopoda *Dryopteris lepidorachis *Dryopteris liyangensis *Dryopteris ludoviciana ‚Äì southern wood fern *Dryopteris macropholis *Dryopteris manshurica *Dryopteris marginalis ‚Äì marginal wood fern *Dryopteris matsumurae *Dryopteris minjiangensis *Dryopteris monticola *Dryopteris montigena *Dryopteris nanpingensis *Dryopteris neolepidopoda *Dryopteris nigropaleacea *Dryopteris nigrosquamosa *Dryopteris nyalamensis *Dryopteris nyingchiensis *Dryopteris odontoloma *Dryopteris oreades ‚Äì mountain male fern *Dryopteris pacifica *Dryopteris pallida *Dryopteris paludicda *Dryopteris panda *Dryopteris parasparsa *Dryopteris pedata *Dryopteris peninsulae *Dryopteris podophylla *Dryopteris polita *Dryopteris prosa *Dryopteris pseudo-sikkimensis *Dryopteris pseudoatrata *Dryopteris pseudodontoloma *Dryopteris pseudofibrillosa *Dryopteris pseudomarginata *Dryopteris pseudouniformis *Dryopteris pulcherrima *Dryopteris qandoensis *Dryopteris quatanensis *Dryopteris reflexosquamata *Dryopteris remota ‚Äì scaly buckler fern *Dryopteris rigida *Dryopteris rosthornii *Dryopteris sacrosancta *Dryopteris saxifraga *Dryopteris scottii *Dryopteris semipinnata *Dryopteris sericea *Dryopteris serrato-dentata *Dryopteris shensicola *Dryopteris shibipedis *Dryopteris sichotensis *Dryopteris sieboldii *Dryopteris sikkimensis *Dryopteris silaensis *Dryopteris sino-sparsa *Dryopteris sinoerythrosora *Dryopteris sinofibrillosa *Dryopteris sordidipes *Dryopteris sparsa *Dryopteris squamifera *Dryopteris squamiseta *Dryopteris stenolepis *Dryopteris subatrata *Dryopteris subbarbigera *Dryopteris subexaltata *Dryopteris sublacera *Dryopteris sublaeta *Dryopteris submarginata *Dryopteris submontana ‚Äì rigid buckler fern *Dryopteris subtriangularis *Dryopteris tarningensis *Dryopteris tenuicula *Dryopteris tenuissima *Dryopteris thibetica *Dryopteris tieluensis *Dryopteris tokyoensis ‚Äì Tokyo wood fern *Dryopteris tsangpoensis *Dryopteris tyrrhena *Dryopteris uniformis *Dryopteris varia *Dryopteris venosa *Dryopteris villarii *Dryopteris wallichiana ‚Äì alpine wood fern *Dryopteris wenchuanensis *Dryopteris wuyishanensis *Dryopteris yigongensis *Dryopteris yungtzeensis *Dryopteris zayuensis File:Dryopteris goldiana.jpgDryopteris goldieana, Goldie's fern File:Dryopteris sieboldii - Atlanta Botanical Garden.JPGDryopteris sieboldii Ecology Dryopteris species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Batrachedra sophroniella (which feeds exclusively on D. cyatheoides) and Sthenopiseauratus. Cultivation and uses Many Dryopteris species are widely used as garden ornamental plants, especially D. affinis, D. erythrosora, and D. filix-mas, with numerous cultivars. Dryopteris filix-mas was throughout much of recent human history widely used as a vermifuge, and was the only fern listed in the U.S. Pharmacopoeia. Traditional use in Scandinavia against red mite (Dermanyssus gallinae) infestation is to place fronds in nesting boxes under nesting material and under floor covering material.

They are known colloquially as the wood ferns. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), the family is placed in the suborder Polypodiineae. Alternatively, it may be treated as the subfamily Dryopteridoideae of a very broadly defined family Polypodiaceae sensu lato. The family contains about 1700 species and has a cosmopolitan distribution. Species may be terrestrial, epipetric, hemiepiphytic, or epiphytic. Many are cultivated as ornamental plants. The largest genera are Elaphoglossum (600+), Polystichum (260), Dryopteris (225), and Ctenitis (150). These four genera contain about 70% of the species. Dryopteridaceae diverged from the other families in eupolypods I about 100 million years ago.  Description  The rhizomes are often stout, creeping, ascending, or erect, and sometimes scandent or climbing, with nonclathrate scales at apices. Fronds are usually monomorphic, less often dimorphic, or sometimes scaly or glandular, but less commonly hairy. Petioles have numerous round, vascular bundles arranged in a ring, or rarely as few as three; the adaxial bundles are largest. Veins are pinnate or forking, free to variously anastomosing; the areoles occur with or without included veinlets; sori are usually round, acrostichoid (covering the entire abaxial surface of the lamina) in a few lineages; usually indusiate, or sometimes exindusiate. Indusia, when present, are round-reniform or peltate. Sporangia have three-rowed, short to long stalks; spores arereniform, monolete, perine or winged. Taxonomy = History = In 1990, Karl U. Kramer and coauthors defined the Dryopteridaceae broadly to include the present family, as well as the Woodsiaceae sensu lato, Onocleaceae, and most of Tectariaceae. Molecular phylogenetic studies found Kramer's version of the Dryopteridaceae to be polyphyletic, and it was split up by Smith and others in 2006. The inclusion of Didymochlaena, Hypodematium, and Leucostegia in the Dryopteridaceae is doubtful. If these three are excluded, then the family is strongly supported as monophyletic in cladistic analyses. Some authors have already treated these genera as outside of the Dryopteridaceae. In 2007, a phylogenetic study of DNA sequences showed that Pleocnemia should be transferred from the Tectariaceae to the Dryopteridaceae. In 2010, in a paper on bolbitidoid ferns, Arthrobotrya was resurrected from Teratophyllum. Later that year, Mickelia was described as a new genus. Some species have been removed from the genus Oenotrichia because they do not belong there or even in the family Dennstaedtiaceae where Oenotrichia sensu stricto is placed. These species probably belong in the Dryopteridaceae, but have not yet been given a generic name. In 2012, a phylogenetic study of Dryopteris and its relatives included Acrophorus, Acrorumohra, Diacalpe, Dryopsis, Nothoperanema, and Peranema within that genus. The Flora of China treatment of the family, published in 2013, used phylogenetic results to sink Lithostegia and Phanerophlebiopsis into Arachniodes. The Dryopteridaceae Herter, under the classification system of Christenhusz and Chase (2014), were submerged as subfamily Dryopteridoideae Link, one of eight subfamilies constituting family Polypodiaceae. This family corresponds to the clade eupolypods I. The Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I) retained the family. =Phylogeny= The following cladogram for the suborder Polypodiineae (eupolypods I), based on the consensus cladogram in the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), shows a likely phylogenetic relationship between Dryopteridaceae and the other families of the clade. = Subdivision = The PPG I classification divides the family into three subfamilies, listed below. * Subfamily Polybotryoideae H.M.Liu & X.C.Zhang ** Cyclodium C.Presl ** Maxonia C.Chr. ** Olfersia Raddi ** Polybotrya Humb. & Bonpl. ex Willd. ** Polystichopsis (J.Sm.)

Aenigmopteris has at times been suggested to belong to this family, on the grounds of its morphological similarity to Ctenitis, but molecular phylogeny has led to its submersion within Tectaria (Tectariaceae). Dryopolystichum has been placed in Lomariopsidaceae.

Molding or moulding (see spelling differences) is the process of manufacturing by shaping liquid or pliable raw material using a rigid frame called a mold or matrix. This itself may have been made using a pattern or model of the final object. A mold or mould is a hollowed-out block that is filled with a liquid or pliable material such as plastic, glass, metal, or ceramic raw material. The liquid hardens or sets inside the mold, adopting its shape. A mold is the counterpart to a cast. The very common bi-valve molding process uses two molds, one for each half of the object. Articulated molds have multiple pieces that come together to form the complete mold, and then disassemble to release the finished casting; they are expensive, but necessary when the casting shape has complex overhangs. Piece- molding uses a number of different molds, each creating a section of a complicated object. This is generally only used for larger and more valuable objects. A manufacturer who makes molds is called a moldmaker. A release agent is typically used to make removal of the hardened/set substance from the mold more easily effected. Typical uses for molded plastics include molded furniture, molded household goods, molded cases, and structural materials.  Types  There are several types of molding methods. These include: * Casting, the oldest term, covering a wide range of materials, especially metals * Blow molding * Powder metallurgy plus sintering * Compression molding * Extrusion molding * Injection molding * Laminating ** Reaction injection molding * Matrix molding * Rotational molding (or Rotomolding) * Spin casting * Transfer molding * Thermoforming ** Vacuum forming, a simplified version of thermoforming * FRP moulding ** Hand lay up moulding ** Resin transfer moulding ** Vacuum bag moulding ** Bladder moulding ** Spray up molding ** Reaction injection molding  Gallery  File:Injection molding die side A.JPG\\"A\\" side of die for 25% glass-filled acetal with 2 side pulls File:Injection molding die with insert.JPGClose up of removable insert in \\"A\\" side File:Injection molding die B side.JPG\\"B\\" side of die with side pull actuators File:Injection molding die insert.JPGInsert removed from die  See also  *Forming *Pressing  References  zh:Ê®°Â°ë ","title":"Molding (process)"},{"id":"605214","text":"BBYO (formerly B'nai B'rith Youth Organization Inc.) is a Jewish teen movement, organized as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization and headquartered in Washington, D.C. The organization is intended to build the identity of Jewish teens and offer leadership development programs. On June 19, 2001, the movement split from B'nai B'rith International, which had been its parent organization, to become incorporated as B'nai B'rith Youth Organization Inc. BBYO is organized into local fraternity- and sorority-like chapters. Male chapters are known as AZA chapters and their members are known as Alephs, and female chapters as BBG chapters, their members known as BBGs. AZA and BBG were independent organizations (beginning in 1924 and 1944 respectively) before becoming brother and sister organizations under B'nai B'rith. In some communities, there are co-ed BBYO chapters which borrow traditions from both organizations.  Organizational model  The organization is active in more than 40 regions, in Europe, South Africa, Australia and North America. BBYO has more than 25,000 members and over 250,000 alumni, as well as about 800 volunteer advisors. BBYO connects Jewish youth with their cultural Jewish roots. By using modern technologies and offering innovative possibilities, the organization reaches many young people. History =Early days of BBYO= AZA's original advisor, Nathan Mnookin, soon left Omaha for his hometown of Kansas City, where he started a similar group with the same name. The Omaha group selected a new advisor, Sam Beber, who soon laid out his plans for an international youth movement based on the local AZA model. In 1924, the Aleph Tzadik Aleph for Young Men, now an international Jewish fraternity, was formed according to Kubo's plan, with the Omaha and Kansas City chapters receiving the first two charters. Four chapters were in attendance at the first convention in June 1924, and ten at the second convention the following summer. By 1925, AZA had expanded east with dozens of chapters across the country. At Beber's urging, B'nai B'rith took up the issue of officially adopting AZA as its junior auxiliary at their national convention in 1925. Supported by Henry Monsky, who himself was vying for the B'nai B'rith presidency, the convention adopted a committee report affirming its approval of the organization under B'nai B'rith's jurisdiction. Immediately following the convention, B'nai B'rith Executive Committee met and officially adopted AZA, which then became known as the Aleph Zadik Aleph of B'nai B'rith. =BBYO's beginnings= In 1944, after a few past failed attempts to begin a Jewish youth group for young women, B'nai B'rith Girls (BBG) became officially recognized and adopted by B'nai B'rith. Anita Perlman is credited with the development of BBG as Sam Beber is credited with the AZA. For the first time, AZA and BBG were united under a single organization, officially cementing their relationship and brother and sister organizations. Combined, the two youth movements were called the B'nai B'rith Youth Organization, and BBYO was born. =From past to present with BBYO= Although the organization has changed greatly behind-the-scenes over the years, its original tenets still remain true: dedication to Jewish life, a pluralistic approach, commitment to community service and social action, and a youth leadership model. BBYO continues to be open to all teenagers that identify themselves as Jews, without exception. Members participate in meeting rituals and sing pep songs that date back to the organization's earliest days. The organization continues to maintain and contribute to its International Service Fund, initiated at the very first international convention. Although the number of professional staff has increased dramatically, BBYO continues to maintain democratic youth leadership at the every level. Just as the organization changed greatly in its first few years, starting as a local youth group to being adopted as the official youth auxiliary of the world's largest Jewish organization, it likewise has undergone drastic changes in recent years. After more than 75 years of a general prosperity, B'nai B'rith began a massive restructuring at the turn of the 21st century in response to the changing face of North American Jewry. As a result, what was then the B'nai B'rith Youth Organization split from B'nai B'rith and, on June 19, 2001, it was incorporated as B'nai B'rith Youth Organization Inc., a separate nonprofit organization. The new organization received substantial funding from the Charles and Lynn Schusterman Family Foundation, and it was chaired by Lynn Schusterman. Traditionally, BBYO was a conglomeration of many largely independent regions. This was the result of the modification of B'nai B'rith's long-standing \\"district\\" model. As new forms of communication have brought the members and staff of BBYO in closer contact, and as the differences between geographic regions continue to deteriorate, BBYO has become much more of a top-down organization, with standardized marketing materials and directives. BBYO has reached into the online market with its b-linked.org website, into the middle school market with its BBYO Connect programs, and into the adult market with its Friends & Alumni Network.

Although it initially started as a dance group, they turned to an all-female band. Zone has been categorized in a new genre called \\"bandol\\" (a portmanteau of the words band and idol). The band was started and managed by Studio RunTime and released their first single, \\"Good Days\\", under the major record label Sony Records, on February 7, 2001. The group has officially ended on March 2, 2013. Their most famous song is \\"Secret Base (Kimi ga Kureta Mono)\\", released on August 8, 2001. The single sold about 744,000 copies on Japanese Oricon charts.  History  Zone started off with eight members in 1997, then reduced to six and finally to four ‚Äì Miyu Nagase, Mizuho Saito, Maiko Sakae, and Takayo Ookoshi ‚Äì by the time they released their first indie disc in 1999. Tadayuki Ominami, a representative of Sony Records, noticed that the crowd reaction to the group's debut concert was particularly enthusiastic. Initially, Zone was solely focused on singing and dancing. Ominami watched a live video of the band playing with instruments at the KomeKome Klub and felt that, due to the overabundance of dance groups, Zone had the makings of a breakthrough act, provided they could play their instruments as well as sing and dance. In late 2003, Takayo Ookoshi announced her departure from Zone to pursue her studies and was replaced by Tomoka Nishimura, one of the two original members cut from the band when they scaled from six members to four. Between 1999 and 2005, Zone released seventeen hit singles, three full-length CDs, and three DVDs, appeared in commercials, and had their own television special, in addition to attending high school. They all graduated. Zone officially disbanded on April 1, 2005, after playing their final concert at Nippon Budokan. On April 13, their greatest hits album E: Complete A Side Singles was released. The album debuted at number 1 with first-week sales of about 98,000 copies, becoming their first number-one album on Japanese Oricon charts. In February 2011, Miyu, Maiko, and Tomoka announced they would be reuniting (without Mizuho) in honor of the 10th anniversary of \\"Secret Base.\\" The group released Zone Tribute in August and made several concert appearances. In November, Tomoka announced she would be leaving the band because of health reasons. Miyu and Maiko continued as a duo, and released \\"Treasure of the Heart\\" in June 2012. In February 2013, Miyu's contract with RunTime Music Agency was dissolved due to the company claiming 'immoral behaviour' and 'frequent non-fulfillment of duties'. On March 2, Maiko posted on the official website for RunTime Entertainment that she would be ending ZONE.

In 1935 she donated the painting to the All Saints' Episcopal Church in West Newbury, Massachusetts. The painting hung over the choir stalls in an enormous gilt frame for several years until it was taken down and stored in a closet, and then in the rectory's attic. In 1999, it was discovered that the painting was not an imitation, but was The Madonna and Child by del Sarto. The painting was then sold at auction by Sotheby's for $1,102,500. The Clara B.

In its 35-year history, the show primarily featured performances by R&B;, soul, dance/pop, and hip hop artists, although funk, jazz, disco, and gospel artists also appeared. The series was created by Don Cornelius, who also served as its first host and executive producer. Production was suspended following the 2005‚Äì2006 season, with a rerun package (known as The Best of Soul Train) airing for two years subsequently. As a nod to Soul Train's longevity, the show's opening sequence during later seasons contained a claim that it was the \\"longest-running first- run, nationally syndicated program in American television history,\\" with over 1,100 episodes produced from the show's debut through the 2005‚Äì2006 season. Despite the production hiatus, Soul Train held that superlative until 2016, when Entertainment Tonight surpassed it completing its 35th season. Among non- news programs, Wheel of Fortune surpassed that mark in 2018. History =Chicago origins= The origins of Soul Train can be traced to 1965 when WCIU-TV, an upstart UHF station in Chicago, began airing two youth-oriented dance programs: Kiddie-a-Go-Go and Red Hot and Blues. These programs‚Äîspecifically the latter, which featured a predominantly African Americans group of in-studio dancers‚Äîwould set the stage for what was to come to the station several years later. Don Cornelius, a news reader and backup disc jockey at Chicago radio station WVON, was hired by WCIU in 1967 as a news and sports reporter. Cornelius also was promoting and emceeing a touring series of concerts featuring local talent (sometimes called \\"record hops\\") at Chicago-area high schools, calling his traveling caravan of shows \\"The Soul Train\\". WCIU-TV took notice of Cornelius's outside work and in 1970, allowed him the opportunity to bring his road show to television. After securing a sponsorship deal with the Chicago-based retailer Sears, Roebuck & Co., Soul Train premiered on WCIU-TV on August 17, 1970, as a live show airing weekday afternoons. Beginning as a low-budget affair, in black and white, the first episode of the program featured Jerry Butler, The Chi-Lites, and the The Emotions as guests. Cornelius was assisted by Clinton Ghent, a local professional dancer who appeared on early episodes before moving behind the scenes as a producer and secondary host. =Move to syndication= Soul Train host Don Cornelius (second from right) with The Staple Singers in 1974. The program's immediate success attracted the attention of another locally based firm‚Äîthe Johnson Products Company (manufacturers of the Afro Sheen line of hair-care products)‚Äîand they later agreed to co-sponsor the program's expansion into national syndication. Cornelius and Soul Trains syndicator targeted 25 markets outside of Chicago to carry the show, but stations in only seven other cities‚ÄîAtlanta, Birmingham, Cleveland, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia‚Äîpurchased the program, which began airing on a weekly basis on October 2, 1971. By the end of the first season, Soul Train was on in the other eighteen markets.Chapman, Aida. \\"Soul Train: A Billboard Spotlight.'\\" Billboard, September 28, 1974. Accessed December 17, 2018. At the time, there were no other commercial television programs being produced by black people for a black audience; the only nationally available show by blacks for blacks at the time was the public television series Soul!Ford Foundation Annual Report 1970, p. 55 of 102 . Accessed online 20 April 2008. When the program moved into syndication, its home base was also shifted to Los Angeles, where it remained for the duration of its run. Soul Train was part of a national trend toward syndicated music-oriented programs targeted at niche audiences; two other network series (Hee Haw for country music, and The Lawrence Welk Show for traditional music) also entered syndication in 1971 and would go on to have long runs. Though Don Cornelius moved his operations west, a local version of Soul Train continued in Chicago; Cornelius hosted both the local Chicago and Los Angeles‚Äìbased national programs simultaneously but soon focused his attention solely on the national edition. He continued to oversee production in Chicago, where Clinton Ghent hosted episodes on WCIU-TV until 1976, followed by three years of once-weekly reruns. The syndicated version was picked up in the Chicago market by CBS-owned-and-operated station WBBM-TV at its launch; the program moved to WGN-TV in 1977 and remained there for the rest of its Chicago run. Don Cornelius hosted every national episode of Soul Train during this era except for one: comedian Richard Pryor guest hosted the final episode of the 1974-75 season. In 1985, Chicago-based Tribune Entertainment (WGN's syndication wing) took over Soul Train's syndication contract; the series would continue distribution through Tribune for the rest of its original run. =Later years= Don Cornelius ended his run as host at the end of the show's 22nd season in 1993, though he remained the show's main creative force from behind the scenes. The following fall, Soul Train began using guest hosts weekly until comedian Mystro Clark began a two-year stint as permanent host in 1997. Clark was replaced by actor Shemar Moore in 2000. In 2003, Moore was succeeded by actor Dorian Gregory, who hosted through 2006. Soul Train pulled into its last stop when production of first-run episodes was suspended at the conclusion of the 2005‚Äì06 season, the show's 35th. Instead, for two seasons starting in 2006‚Äì07, the program aired archived episodes (all from between 1973 and 1988) under the title The Best of Soul Train.Soul Train - Don Cornelius Productions, Inc. This was because in later years, Nielsen ratings dropped to below 1.0; most of the stations that aired Soul Train by that point were either Fox affiliates or independent station that would later become WB or UPN affiliates, and, in the process, some of the stations which had been airing Soul Train on Saturday afternoons started rescheduling the program to overnight time slots. The future of Soul Train was uncertain with the announced closing of Tribune Entertainment in December 2007, which left Don Cornelius Productions to seek a new distributor for the program. Cornelius soon secured a deal with Trifecta Entertainment & Media. =Attempted revivals and new ownership= When Don Cornelius Productions still owned the program, clips of the show's performances and interviews were kept away from online video sites such as YouTube owing to copyright infringement claims. Cornelius also frowned upon the unauthorized distribution of Soul Train episodes through the sale of third-party VHS or DVD compilations. In May 2008, Cornelius sold the rights to the Soul Train library to MadVision Entertainment, whose principal partners came from the entertainment and publishing fields. The price and terms of the deal were not disclosed. However, by the start of the 2008‚Äì09 television season, the Tribune Broadcasting-owned stations (including national carrier WGN America) that had been the linchpin of the show's syndication efforts dropped the program, and many others followed suit. Soul Trains website acknowledged that the program had ceased distribution on September 22, 2008. Following the purchase by MadVision, the Soul Train archives were exposed to new forms of distribution. In April 2009, MadVision launched a Soul Train channel on YouTube. Three months later, the company entered into a licensing agreement with Time Life to distribute Soul Train DVD sets.\\"Soul Train - Heads Up: The Hippest Trip In America Comes to DVD Soon!\\" TV Shows on DVD. MadVision then came to terms with ViacomCBS-owned BET to relaunch the Soul Train Music Awards for BET's spin-off channel, Centric, in November 2009. Centric would broadcast archived episodes of the program. Archived episodes can also be seen on Bounce TV. MadVision sold the rights to Soul Train to a consortium led by basketball player Magic Johnson and backed by private equity firm InterMedia Partners in 2011. The Johnson-InterMedia consortium planned on a potential film project Cornelius had briefly mentioned prior to selling the franchise, as well as producing potential stage adaptations and a cruise. As part of the sale, Johnson's Aspire TV channel also began airing reruns of the series. Cornelius continued to appear for Soul Train documentaries and ceremonies up until his death by suicide in February 2012. In 2013, the cruise-based revival, called the Soul Train Cruise, began taking place. The cruise is presented by Centric. All rights and trademarks to the Soul Train brand including the show's extensive library, the annual cruise event, and the award shows are under the ownership of ViacomCBS after its BET Networks division acquired the franchise in 2016. =Influence= Some commentators have called Soul Train a \\"black American Bandstand,\\" another long-running program with which Soul Train shares some similarities. Cornelius acknowledged Bandstand as a model for his program; as the years advanced and Soul Train evolved into a tradition in its own right, he tended to bristle at the Bandstand comparisons.In episode 338 of the series, which aired in October 1980, guest performer Rick James begins cavorting with audience members only to have Cornelius stop him and tell him \\"This ain't Bandstand!\\" In 1973, Dick Clark, host and producer of Bandstand, launched Soul Unlimited ‚Äî controversial for its pronounced racial overtures ‚Äî to compete directly with Soul Train. Cornelius, with help from Jesse Jackson, openly accused Clark of trying to undermine TV's only Black-owned show. Agreeing, ABC canceled it after a few episodes. Clark later agreed to work with Cornelius on a series of network specials featuring R&B; and soul artists. Cornelius was relatively conservative in his musical tastes and was admittedly not a fan of the emerging hip hop genre, believing that the genre did not reflect positively on African-American culture (one of his stated goals for the series). Even though Cornelius would feature rap artists on Soul Train frequently during the 1980s, he publicly would admit (to the artists' faces such as Kurtis Blow) that the genre was one that he did not understand; as rap continued to move further toward hardcore hip hop, Cornelius would admit to be frightened by the antics of groups such as Public Enemy. Rosie Perez testified in the 2010 VH1 documentary Soul Train: The Hippest Trip in America that Cornelius also disliked seeing the show's dancers perform sexually suggestive \\"East Coast\\" dance moves. Cornelius admittedly had rap artists on the show only because the genre was becoming popular among his African-American audience, though the decision alienated middle-aged, more affluent African Americans like himself. This disconnect (which was openly mocked in an In Living Color sketch where Cornelius and the show were lampooned as extremely old and out of touch) eventually led to Cornelius's stepping down as host in the early 1990s and the show's losing its influence.See the 2010 documentary Soul Train: The Hippest Trip in America. Questlove, drummer for hip-hop band The Roots and a fan of the program, authored , which was published in 2013. Program elements Within the structure of the program, there were two enduring elements. The first was the \\"Soul Train Scramble Board\\", where two dancers are given 60 seconds to unscramble a set of letters that form the name of that show's performer or a notable person in African American history. In describing the person's renown, the host concluded their description with the phrase \\"...whose name you should know\\". Cornelius openly admitted after the series ended its run that the game was usually set up so everybody won in an effort not to cause embarrassment for the show or African Americans in general. = Soul Train line = There was also the popular \\"Soul Train Line\\" (a variant of the 1950s fad then known as The Stroll), in which all the dancers form two lines with a space in the middle for dancers to strut down and dance in consecutive order. Originally, this consisted of a couple‚Äîwith men on one side and women on the other. In later years, men and women had their own individual lineups. Sometimes, new dance styles or moves were featured or introduced by particular dancers. In addition, there was an in-studio group of dancers who danced along to the music as it was being performed. Rosie Perez, Damita Jo Freeman, Darnell Williams, Cheryl Song, Louie \\"Ski\\" Carr, Alfie Lewis, Pat Davis (\\"Madam Butterfly\\"), Alise Mekhail, Andrea N. Miles, Carmen Electra, Nick Cannon, MC Hammer, Jermaine Stewart, Heather Hunter, Fred Berry, Laurieann Gibson, Pebbles, and NFL legend Walter Payton were among those who got noticed dancing on the program over the years. Two former dancers, Jody Watley and Jeffrey Daniel, enjoyed years of success as members of the R&B; group Shalamar after they were chosen by Soul Train talent booker/record promoter Dick Griffey and Cornelius to replace the group's original session singers in 1978. = Guest stars = Each musical guest usually performed twice on each program; after their first number, they were joined by the program host onstage for a brief interview. From time to time, stand-up comedians, such as Tom Dreesen (whom Don Cornelius knew from his time in Chicago) and Franklyn Ajaye (known in the 1970s for being a star of the hit movie Car Wash), would be featured on the program to perform a brief comedy routine. Soul Train was also known for two popular catchphrases, referring to itself as the \\"Hippest trip in America\\" at the beginning of the show and closing the program with \\"...and you can bet your last money, it's all gonna be a stone gas, honey. I'm Don Cornelius, and as always in parting, we wish you love, peace...and SOUL!\\" UK version In 1985, Cornelius gave permission for a version of the show in the United Kingdom. The UK version, hosted by former Soul Train dancer and member of Shalamar Jeffrey Daniel, was titled 620 Soul Train and ran for one series. Spinoffs In 1987, Soul Train launched the Soul Train Music Awards, which honors the top performances in R&B;, hip hop, and gospel music (and, in its earlier years, jazz music) from the previous year. Soul Train then produced the short-lived Soul Train Comedy Awards in 1993, which discontinued that same year. Soul Train later created two additional annual specials: The Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards, first airing in 1995, celebrated top achievements by female performers; and the Soul Train Christmas Starfest, which premiered in 1998, featured holiday music performed by a variety of R&B; and gospel artists. Award categories for the Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards presented to female recipients included: *R&B;/Soul Album of the Year, Solo *Best R&B;/Soul Album of the Year, Group or Duo *R&B;/Soul Song of the Year *Best R&B;/Soul Single, Solo *Best R&B;/Soul Single, Group or Duo *Best R&B;/Soul or Rap New Artist *Best Jazz Album *Best Gospel Album *Best R&B;/Soul or Rap Music Video Special awards given were The Aretha Franklin Award for Entertainer of the Year, and The Lena Horne Award for Outstanding Career Achievements. The Lady of Soul Awards and Christmas Starfest programs last aired in 2005. In April 2008, Don Cornelius announced that year's Soul Train Music Awards ceremony had been canceled. Cornelius cited 2007-08 Writers Guild of America strike by the Writers Guild of America as one of the reasons, though a main factor may have been the uncertainty surrounding Soul Train's future. Cornelius also announced that a motion picture based on the program was in development. Subsequent owners of the franchise have followed their own agenda for the program, which included a revival of the Soul Train Music Awards in 2009. Theme music Soul Train used various original and current music for theme songs during its run, including * 1971‚Äì1973: \\"Soul Train (Hot Potato)\\", by King Curtis (Curtis Ousley) and later redone by The Rimshots as \\"Soul Train, Parts 1 & 2\\". [The original 1962 version, which was used on the show, was recorded nine years before the show was named \\"Hot Potatoes (Piping Hot)\\"] * 1973‚Äì1975: \\"TSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia)\\", composed by Gamble and Huff and recorded by MFSB with vocals by The Three Degrees. Released as a single, this song became a pop and R&B; radio hit in 1974 and the show's best-known theme. * 1975‚Äì1976: \\"Soul Train '75\\", by The Soul Train Gang, which was later released as a single for the newly formed SOLAR Records * 1976‚Äì1978: \\"Soul Train '76 (Get On Board)\\", by The Soul Train Gang * 1978‚Äì1980: \\"Soul Train Theme '79\\", produced by the Hollywood Disco Jazz Band with vocals by the Waters * 1980‚Äì1983: \\"Up On Soul Train\\", first by the Waters and later by The Whispers, whose version appears in their 1980 album Imagination. * 1983‚Äì1987: \\"Soul Train's a Comin'\\", by R&B; artist O'BryanO'Bryan Soul Train's A Comin' (Remix) - 1983 - Song - MP3 Stream on IMEEM Music. * 1987‚Äì1993: \\"TSOP '87\\", a remake of the original \\"TSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia),\\" composed and produced by George Duke * 1989‚Äì1993: \\"TSOP '89\\", a remixed version of \\"TSOP '87\\", by George Duke * 1993‚Äì1999: \\"Soul Train '93\\" (Know You Like to Dance)\\", by Naughty by Nature with a saxophone solo by Everette Harp * 2000‚Äì2006: \\"TSOP 2000\\", with rap vocals by Samson and music by Dr. Freeze, and again featuring an Everette Harp saxophone solo. However, a portion of \\"Know You Like to Dance\\" was still used in the show's second-half opening segment during this period, though in earlier episodes, a portion of \\"TSOP 2000\\" was played.

In interval complementation a complement is the interval which, when added to the original interval, spans an octave in total. For example, a major 3rd is the complement of a minor 6th. The complement of any interval is also known as its inverse or inversion. Note that the octave and the unison are each other's complements and that the tritone is its own complement (though the latter is \\"re-spelt\\" as either an augmented fourth or a diminished fifth, depending on the context). In the aggregate complementation of twelve-tone music and serialism the complement of one set of notes from the chromatic scale contains all the other notes of the scale. For example, A-B-C-D-E-F-G is complemented by B-C-E-F-A. Note that musical set theory broadens the definition of both senses somewhat. Interval complementation =Rule of nine= The rule of nine is a simple way to work out which intervals complement each other. Taking the names of the intervals as cardinal numbers (fourth etc. becomes four), we have for example 4 + 5 = 9. Hence the fourth and the fifth complement each other. Where we are using more generic names (such as semitone and tritone) this rule cannot be applied. However, octave and unison are not generic but specifically refer to notes with the same name, hence 8 + 1 = 9. Perfect intervals complement (different) perfect intervals, major intervals complement minor intervals, augmented intervals complement diminished intervals, and double diminished intervals complement double augmented intervals. =Rule of twelve= Integer interval complementation: 5 + 7 = 0 mod 12 Using integer notation and modulo 12 (in which the numbers \\"wrap around\\" at 12, 12 and its multiples therefore being defined as 0), any two intervals which add up to 0 (mod 12) are complements (mod 12). In this case the unison, 0, is its own complement, while for other intervals the complements are the same as above (for instance a perfect fifth, or 7, is the complement of the perfect fourth, or 5, 7 + 5 = 12 = 0 mod 12). Thus the #Sum of complementation is 12 (= 0 mod 12). =Set theory= In musical set theory or atonal theory, complement is used in both the sense above (in which the perfect fourth is the complement of the perfect fifth, 5+7=12), and in the additive inverse sense of the same melodic interval in the opposite direction ‚Äì e.g. a falling 5th is the complement of a rising 5th. Aggregate complementation Literal pc complementation: the pitch or pitches not in the set on the left are contained in the set on the right and vice versa Side-slipping complementation: C7 chord/Lydian dominant scale (chord- scale system) and complement . In twelve-tone music and serialism complementation (in full, literal pitch class complementation) is the separation of pitch-class collections into complementary sets, each containing pitch classes absent from the otherWhittall, Arnold. 2008.

Thomas Street Christensen, editor. . To provide, \\"a simple explanation...: the complement of a pitch-class set consists, in the literal sense, of all the notes remaining in the twelve-note chromatic that are not in that set.\\"Pasler, Jann (1986). Confronting Stravinsky: Man, Musician, and Modernist, p.97. . In the twelve-tone technique this is often the separation of the total chromatic of twelve pitch classes into two hexachords of six pitch classes each. In rows with the property of combinatoriality, two twelve- note tone rows (or two permutations of one tone row) are used simultaneously, thereby creating, \\"two aggregates, between the first hexachords of each, and the second hexachords of each, respectively.\\" In other words, the first and second hexachord of each series will always combine to include all twelve notes of the chromatic scale, known as an aggregate, as will the first two hexachords of the appropriately selected permutations and the second two hexachords. Hexachordal complementation is the use of the potential for pairs of hexachords to each contain six different pitch classes and thereby complete an aggregate.Whittall 2008, p.273. Combinatorial tone rows from Moses und Aron by Arnold Schoenberg pairing complementary hexachords from P-0/I-3Whittall, 103 =Sum of complementation= For example, given the transpositionally related sets: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 ‚àí 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 0  11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 The difference is always 11. The first set may be called P0 (see tone row), in which case the second set would be P1. In contrast, \\"where transpositionally related sets show the same difference for every pair of corresponding pitch classes, inversionally related sets show the same sum.\\"Perle, George (1996). Twelve-Tone Tonality, p.4. . For example, given the inversionally related sets (P0 and I11): 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 +11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0  11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 The sum is always 11. Thus for P0 and I11 the sum of complementation is 11. =Abstract complement= In set theory the traditional concept of complementation may be distinguished as literal pitch class complement, \\"where the relation obtains between specific pitch-class sets\\", while, due to the definition of equivalent sets, the concept may be broadened to include \\"not only the literal pc complement of that set but also any transposed or inverted-and-transposed form of the literal complement,\\"Schmalfeldt, Janet (1983).

As a further example take the chromatic sets 7-1 and 5-1. If the pitch-classes of 7-1 span C‚ÄìF and those of 5-1 span G‚ÄìB then they are literal complements. However, if 5-1 spans C‚ÄìE, C‚ÄìF, or D‚ÄìF, then it is an abstract complement of 7-1. As these examples make clear, once sets or pitch- class sets are labeled, \\"the complement relation is easily recognized by the identical ordinal number in pairs of sets of complementary cardinalities\\".

It is in size, has 5,200 seats and a natural grass field. From home plate to centre field the distance is ; from home plate to left and right field down the lines, it is . Labatt Park is the \\"oldest continually operating baseball grounds in the world\\", with a history dating back to 1877. Since December 31, 1936, Labatt Park has been owned by the City of London. On September 7, 2011, Baseball Canada announced that historic Labatt Memorial Park in London, Ontario, had won its six-week-long, favourite ballpark contest, winning the final round where it went head-to-head with Port Arthur Stadium in Thunder Bay, Ontario. During the two-week-long, final round of online voting, where more than 19,000 votes were cast, Labatt Park won with 63 per cent of the vote. However, Fuller Field in Clinton, Massachusetts made it into the Guinness Book of World Records in September 2007 as the \\"world's oldest continually used baseball diamond/ field\\", dating back to 1878‚Äîa year after Tecumseh Park-Labatt Park opened in 1877‚Äîas Fuller Field's home plate and bases have purportedly remained in the same location since 1878, whereas home plate at Labatt Park has been moved (within the same field) from its original location in 1877. In September 2008, however, Labatt Park replaced Clinton, Massachusetts' Fuller Field in the 2009 Guinness Book of World Records (page 191) as the \\"World's Oldest Baseball Diamond.\\" Although it has flip flopped in the past, as of January 4, 2016, Guinness's online record for the World's Oldest Baseball Field/Diamond now states Labatt Park, London, Ontario. World's Oldest Baseball Field On May 30, 1994, the park was designated by London City Council under Part IV of the Ontario Heritage Act as an historic site via by- Law No. L.S.P.-3237-544, with the ceremonial plaque unveiling at the front gates of the park occurring on July 1 (Canada Day), 1994, prior to a doubleheader between the London Majors and Toronto Maple Leafs of the Intercounty Baseball League. The park's designation occurred after a six- month-long lobbying effort spearheaded by the volunteer, non-profit organization, The Friends of Labatt Park, which has undertaken a number of initiatives during the past 24 years to enhance and promote the ballpark, its history and ambience. A possible new stadium for the Montreal Expos was proposed (to replace the aging Montreal Olympic Stadium which the Expos had called home since the 1970s), also to be named Labatt Park. However, plans for the new stadium were shelved when the necessary public funding could not be secured. Commons area at the riverforks According to Seneca College's Professor Bill Humber, a noted Canadian baseball historian and author, the site of today's Labatt Park was likely used for recreational games when it was a grassy commons area at the riverforks, prior to becoming Tecumseh Park in 1877. Baseball's roots are in the immediate area around London. The game of baseball, a derivative of the British game of rounders, had probably arrived in the area from nearby Beachville, Ontario, where the world's first recorded baseball game was played in 1838. (See Baseball Before We Knew It and Origins of baseball for other possible origins). London Tecumsehs The founding of the London Tecumsehs Baseball Club in 1868 ultimately led to the creation of Tecumseh Park in 1877. According to the London Advertiser of May 4, 1877, the first game at the new baseball park was held on May 3, 1877, with a contest between the London Tecumsehs and its junior team, the London Atlantics. The Tecumsehs won 5-1. To wit: \\"The first regular game of baseball of the season was played yesterday afternoon in the presence of fully a thousand people. The new grounds are the most complete of every respect of any of the kind in Canada, and but few American cities have a convenient playing field.\\" On May 4, 1877, the Tecumsehs met the Hartfords of Brooklyn in their first International league game. Phil Powers, the Tecumsehs' star catcher, was out with a broken finger. The London nine were defeated 6-2. On May 24, 1877, before 8,000 fans, the National League champion Boston Red Stockings played the London Tecumsehs of the fledgling International Association. With its star pitcher and later Chicago White Stocking stalwart, Fred Goldsmith. Boston narrowly defeated London, 7-6. Created by London china merchant W. J. Reid, Tecumseh Park was named after the Shawnee Chief Tecumseh who fought alongside the British during the War of 1812 and who died in the Battle of the Thames near Chatham, Ontario, in October 1813. Jacob Englehart, the Cleveland-born oil tycoon, a future vice president of Imperial Oil and the Tecumseh's president/principal owner, moved the team to Tecumseh Park in 1877. Englehart soon began looking for professional players from the U.S., later signing four Americans: * first-baseman/manager George \\"Juice\\" Latham * pitcher Fred Goldsmith of New Haven, Connecticut (believed by many to be the co-inventor of the curveball along with Candy Cummings of Ware, Massachusetts) * catcher Phil Powers and * infielder/outfielder Joe Hornung (nicknamed \\"Dutchy\\" and \\"Ubbo Ubbo\\") from Carthage, New York. Goldsmith's first complete game with the Tecumsehs occurred on May 24, 1876, when London played Guelph Maple Leafs before 6,000 spectators at the old Fair Grounds (southeast corner of Wellington and Pall Mall streets in London), a contest that London won 8-7 in 10 innings, largely due to Goldsmith's \\"scientific pitching\\", using his innovative \\"skew ball.\\" After the Tecumsehs, Goldsmith went on to pitch for the Troy, New York Trojans in 1879, National League's Chicago White Stockings from 1880 to 1884 and the American Association's Baltimore Orioles, also in 1884. In addition to Englehart, the Tecumsehs' back-room movers and shakers consisted of London newspaperman Harry Gorman; Ed Moore, manager of the Tecumseh House; Richard Meredith, a future chief justice of the Supreme Court of Ontario; William Southam, who was to found Southam News and to add an egalitarian touch, Jim Jury, a custodian at the collegiate institute. The following year in 1877, the Tecumsehs played in the International Association, a rival of the National League. That year, the Tecumsehs defeated the National League's Boston Red Stockings in an exhibition game at Tecumseh Park and later in the season they defeated the Pittsburgh Allegheny 5-2 to win the International Association pennant. More than 6,000 people attended London's pennant-winning game in a park built to seat 600. After the season, the Tecumsehs were offered membership in the National League, but declined. The Tecusmsehs subsequently folded on August 22, 1878, due to financial difficulties compounded by a questionable game lost by the Tecumsehs and the International Association floundered a few years later. Both were resurrected in 1888 and 1889. Among its more notable stars in 1888 was outfielder Patsy Donovan who went on to an outstanding career in Major League Baseball as both a player and a manager. The Tecumsehs also played at the park pre- and post-1920, with Charlie (Mechanical Man) Gehringer playing with the 1921‚Äì1924 Tecumsehs before he went on to a stellar career with the Detroit Tigers. Gehringer was subsequently inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. American baseball historians Bill Weiss and Marshall Wright have placed the 1920 London Tecumsehs on the list of the Top 100 Minor League Baseball Teams of all-time‚Äîcoming in at #52, with a record of 86 wins and 32 losses. On September 15, 1920, with Ty Cobb in the lineup, the Detroit Tigers defeated the London Tecumsehs 5-4 before 3,000 people at Tecumseh Park in exhibition baseball. Reserved seating for the game was $1. The 1920 Tecumsehs clinched the first-place pennant with 15 games to play and London led the Michigan-Ontario league in attendance, with an astonishing 100,686 people watching them play. On May 9, 1921, under manager George (Mooney) Gibson, the Pittsburgh Pirates beat the London Tecumsehs 8-7 at Tecumseh Park before 3,500 people in an exhibition baseball game. Before the game, Gibson and his team were presented with a silver loving cup by the London Kiwanis Club. Gibson thrilled the locals by catching the opening inning with his 1909 World Series-winning battery mate Babe Adams and singling and scoring a run in his lone at-bat. London Mayor Syd Little entertained the team that evening at his home. On September 14, 1921, the Tecumsehs won the Michigan-Ontario Baseball League championship, 1-0 over Bay City, Michigan, before 1,000 people at Tecumseh Park. London scored its lone run in the first inning when third baseman Doc Shay, playing his first game of the series because of illness, tripled and scores on a sacrifice fly. In three games of the series, London pitcher Frank Herbst of London allowed six hits and only one run in 33 innings. London advanced against Ludington, Michigan, champions of the Central League. On September 28, 1921, London won the best-of-seven series against Ludington 4-3, taking Game 7 10-7 at Grand Rapids, Mich. The Tecumsehs were down 3-1 in the series. A few days later, London manager Buzz Wetzel was presented with a gold watch to commemorate the win. The normally reserved Wetzel spoke, saying, \\"I tried to do what was right and give you the best I had and I honestly believe that the fans here have a right to be proud of their baseball team.\\" On May 23, 1923, Washington's pitching ace Walter Johnson was in uniform but did not pitch as the Washington Senators defeated the Tecumsehs 13-9 in an exhibition baseball game at Tecumseh Park. George (Mooney) Gibson George Gibson baseball card, 1911 One of the early stars to emerge from Tecumseh Park was London West resident, George Gibson, a young bricklayer-homebuilder turned catcher who enjoyed a lengthy playing career with the Pittsburgh Pirates, winning the World Series in 1909 by beating Ty Cobb's Detroit Tigers. When he arrived back at the train station in his hometown on October 27, 1909, there were more than 5,000 cheering fans to greet him. London, at the time, had approximately 35,000 residents. Gibson played in the Major Leagues until 1918, 12 years with the Pirates and two years with the New York Giants, appearing in 1,213 games. Gibson first signed a pro contract in 1903 and joined the Pittsburgh Pirates two years later. He had a strong throwing arm and led National League catchers in fielding percentage several times. Known as a developer of young pitchers, Gibson later managed the Toronto Maple Leafs of the AAA International League in 1919, the Pirates (1920-1922, 1932-1934) and the Chicago Cubs (1925). He was named Canada's baseball player of the half century and in 1958 was the first baseball player elected to the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame. He was subsequently inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame & Museum in 1987 and was one of the inaugural 10 inductees into the London Sports Hall of Fame in 2001. Thames River flood of 1883 Tecumseh Park was damaged by a flood of the Thames River on July 11, 1883 which destroyed the original grandstands, located near today's outfield foul ball lines. Originally, home plate was located in today's left-centre field. The new replacement grandstand (1883‚Äì1937) was built facing east toward downtown London, with home plate moved to approximately the same location as it is today. Beginning in 1892 the park was used for amateur and professional bicycle races, attracting such international stars as Harley Davidson (the Canadian Wheelman, a late-19th century cycling magazine was started and published in London). Baseball continued to be played there as well, with three more incarnations of the Tecumsehs in the International Association (1888‚Äì1889), the International League (1890), and the Canadian League (1898‚Äìcirca 1915), with the London Alerts, also of the Canadian League, playing in 1897 and 1899. Meanwhile, in 1895 the park was the site of the first-ever motion picture display in London, organized by the London Bicycle Club. The London Cockneys played in the Class D International League in 1908 and the Class C Canadian League in 1911, while another Tecumsehs club played in the Class C and Class B Leagues from 1912 to 1915. It was during this period that Earle Neale played baseball at Labatt Park before he started his career in the Big Leagues with the Cincinnati Reds in 1916, later becoming an award-winning and innovative football coach in American pro football. The Tecumsehs played in the Class B Michigan‚ÄìOntario League from 1919 to 1924, and during the early 1920s, the team included future Major League second-base star Charlie Gehringer. Gehringer and the Tecumsehs defeated the Boston Red Sox in an exhibition game, also in 1921. A second London team, the Indians, played in the Michigan‚ÄìOntario League in 1925. The Tecumsehs also played in the Class D Ontario League in 1930. In 1940 and 1941, the London Pirates played in the Pennsylvania‚ÄìOntario‚ÄìNew York League, more commonly known as the PONY League. It was during this period that lights were installed at Labatt Park to permit night baseball. The 1941 Pirates team included pitcher Russ Getsinger and future Major Leaguers such as Jim Jordan and Vic Barnhart. Vic's brother Bob Barnhart was also a teammate on the 1941 London Pirates. Vic's father Clyde Barnhart was a star with the Pittsburgh Pirates throughout the 1920s including the 1925 and 1927 World Series teams. Negro Leagues and other players During the first half of the 20th Century, Labatt Park (Tecumseh Park until December 31, 1936) was regularly visited by numerous barnstorming Negro teams from the U.S., plus a much-celebrated visit by legendary African-American pitcher Satchel Paige on June 30, 1954, when Paige was barnstorming with a baseball version of the Harlem Globetrotters. Paige pitched the last three innings of an exhibition game against another legendary barnstorming ream‚ÄîThe House of David baseball team, who all sported beards and long hair and travelled with their own generator-powered lights (before Labatt Park installed lights in the 1940s), which featured noted baseball clown, Frank (Bobo) Nickerson. As of October 1, 1923, The London Colored Stars, a Negro baseball team, had won 15 of 19 games and announced they \\"are looking for more engagements.\\" Additionally, numerous former players with the Negro Leagues played in the Senior Intercounty Baseball League after the Negro Leagues gradually folded after Jackie Robinson broke the \\"colour barrier\\" in 1947, including pitcher Ted Alexander of the Kansas City Monarchs and the Homestead Grays (1950-51 London Majors); Wilmer Fields (Brantford Red Sox); Jimmy Wilkes (retired jersey #5 for the Brantford Red Sox, later became a City league umpire after a decade with Brantford); Gentry (Geep) Jessup (Galt Terriers); Larry Cunningham (Galt Terriers, Hamilton Cardinals); Ed Steele (Galt) and Shanty Clifford (Galt and Brantford); Luther Clifford; Max Manning; Lester Lockett; Bob Thurman and Stanley Glenn (St. Thomas Elgins); all made numerous appearances at Labatt Park in the 1950s. The late Wilmer (The Great) Fields is a former president of the Negro Leagues Baseball Association (NLBPA), while Stanley (Doc) Glenn is currently the president of the NLBPA. Bryce's 1876 and 1877 Baseball Guides This is the world's oldest baseball grounds still in existence. Front cover to Bryce's Base Ball Guide 1876, published in London, Ont. Baseball socks for sale in Bryce's Base Ball Guide 1876 A treasure-trove of information about early Canadian/Ontario \\"base ball\\" surfaced in 2002 when Library and Archives Canada purchased (for $10,000 from an Ottawa, Ontario, bookseller) Bryce's Base Ball Guide 1876 and Bryce's Base Ball Guide 1877, two hand-coloured, 75-page booklets published by William Bryce of London, Ontario, which originally sold for a dime. The two, four-inch (102 mm) by seven-inch guides are considered to be the first significant publications on Canadian baseball. Bryce, a Scottish-born bookseller, news agent and sporting goods distributor in London, had a small stake in the Tecumsehs, considered by many to be the finest ball team in the entire Dominion of Canada. During U.S. President George W. Bush's visit to the Library and Archives Canada building on November 30, 2004, he showed a special interest in these two early Canadian base ball books which were laid out for his perusal. See here Tecumseh Park becomes Labatt Park According to the 1926 Geodetic Survey of Canada (and the subsequent detailed maps printed in 1928), there was a structure situated near what is now the main entrance to the ballpark at 25 Wilson Avenue (at the time, the two entrances to the ballpark were off of Dundas Street‚Äînow Riverside Drive‚Äîincluding an art deco entranceway that was demolished in the early 1980s). According to Mooney Gibson's nephew, George Lambourn, a noted baseball historian in his own right, the residence at 27 Wilson Avenue was the home of the park's cranky caretaker, Jakey Butts, which was destroyed by the Thames River flood of 1937. This devastating flood damaged the park again, necessitating the construction of the park's third grandstand (1937‚Äì2001) and a new clubhouse, with the local Labatt Brewing Company donating $10,000 to renovate the park, as well as deeding the park itself to the City of London on December 31, 1936, with the written provisions that the park remain a public athletic park in perpetuity and that it be renamed \\"The John Labatt Memorial Athletic Park.\\" From a sociological-historical perspective, it could be argued that the name change from Tecumseh Park to Labatt Memorial Park highlights the dramatic shift from 19th-Century colonial Canada (where the Shawnee Chief Tecumseh was immortalized throughout Canada for aiding the British in the War of 1812) to more modern times where businesses such as the Labatt Brewing Company exercised considerable influence on the cultural fabric of the day. At the end of August during the 1950s, Labatt Park annually hosted athletes from across the city's playgrounds competing in a variety of sports during a two- to three-day event, called the \\"Junior Olympiad.\\" (A P.U.C. Playground Supervisor's Reunion was held on June 24, 2006, at the City-owned Thames Valley Golf Course.) Frank Colman and Tom Burgess Other London notables to graduate to the Major Leagues from Labatt Park during the 1940s are Tom (Tim) Burgess (1927‚Äì2008) and Frank Colman (1918-1983). In 1936, Frank Colman started out at Labatt Park with the London Winery of the Senior Intercounty Baseball League, winning the Most Valuable Player award, batting title and Intercounty Baseball League championship. Colman was 25 when he broke into the major leagues as a right fielder with the Pittsburgh Pirates, playing with them from 1942 through 1946, before he moved to New York to play with the Yankees. He played with the Yankees in 1946 and 1947, where he roomed with Yankee catcher Yogi Berra. He finished his six-year major league career with 571 at-bats, 15 home runs and 106 RBIs. Colman returned to London in 1954 after playing in the minor leagues and being the player/coach of the Toronto Maple Leafs of the AAA International League from 1951‚Äì1953. He bought the London Majors and, as player/ owner, won the Intercounty League title in 1956 and the Great Lakes championship in 1957 before returning to the Intercounty League in 1958 and selling the team in 1959. Colman is also a co-founder of the Eager Beaver Baseball Association (EBBA) in London which has provided competitive league play for thousands of youngsters since its founding in 1955. In 1984, a year after Colman's death, the EBBA's all-star day in mid- July was renamed \\"Frank Colman Day.\\" Colman was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame & Museum in 1999 and the London Sports Hall of Fame in 2005. In a letter to the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 1999, Yogi Berra wrote that he visited Colman at his home in Canada on several occasions. \\"I've made a lot of friends in baseball through the years, but I'll always remember Frank as one of the most decent and genuine people that I ever met\\", Berra wrote. \\"I was proud that he was my friend.\\" Tom Burgess first signed a pro contract with St. Louis in 1946 and played right field and first base for the St. Louis Cardinals from 1954 to 1961 and right field and first base for the Los Angeles Angels from 1962-1963\\\\. \\"[Former P.U.C. recreation director] Bill Farquharson gave me the opportunity from the playground days and I worked my way up to the big leagues where I made a living for 44 years.\\"‚ÄîTom (Tim) Burgess, November 28, 2005 Since 1968, Burgess has been involved in Major League Baseball in a variety of managing, coaching and instructor capacities with several organizations, including the St. Louis Cardinals from 1968 to 1975, the New York Mets from 1976 to 1977, the Texas Rangers from 1980 to 1984, the Detroit Tigers from 1985 to 1987, the Kansas City Royals from 1987 to 1995. From 1996 to the present day, Burgess has been an instructor with both Baseball Canada and the Ontario Baseball Association. He was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame & Museum in 1992 and the London Sports Hall of Fame in 2003. London Supremes and London Army Team During World War II (1942 onward), the park was the home field for several women's baseball, softball and fastball teams, including the London Supremes who played in the Michigan-Ontario Women's Fastball League into the 1950s. In 1943 and 1944, the London Army Team won the Canadian Sandlot title. Shortly after World War II Labatt Park was the home of the London Majors, which won the Canadian Sandlot Congress in 1947 and the Can-Am Baseball Congress championship in 1948, beating the Fort Wayne, Indiana, General Electrics in a best-of-seven-game series at Labatt Park, as well as winning the Canadian, Ontario and Intercounty titles. Denny McLain and Fergie Jenkins In 1974, after Cy Young Award-winning pitcher Denny McLain had retired from the major leagues (two years earlier), McLain played a season for the London Majors, restricting himself to home games at Labatt Park. Due to arm problems, however, McLain only pitched nine innings for the Majors, but did play in 14 games at either shortstop, first base and catcher and batted .380, including hitting two homers in one game in London. After Cy Young Award-winning pitcher Fergie Jenkins pitched his final major league game on September 26, 1983, London Majors' owner-player Arden Eddie convinced Jenkins to pitch for the Majors in 1984-85, commuting from his home near Chatham, Ontario. The Canadian-born Jenkins is one of the few MLB players to have been inducted into both the Baseball Hall of Fame & Museum in Cooperstown, New York and the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame & Museum in St. Marys, Ontario, Canada. Tigers, Werewolves and Monarchs Professional baseball declined in London after the war, with mostly amateur teams playing at Labatt Park in the following decades, until 1989 when an AA Eastern League affiliate of the Detroit Tigers was established by investors/ Board of Directors, President Dan Ross, Vice President Mike Tucker, Vice President and General Manager Bob Gilson, Vice President and Assistant General Manager General Manager Bill Wilkinson and Vice President Brian Costello. Immediately prior to the London Tigers' inaugural season at Labatt Park in 1989, numerous improvements were completed at the park costing approximately $1-million for new lights, new dressing rooms and dug outs, additional seating, field and entrance upgrades, food concession enhancements and a new -by-19-foot electronic scoreboard (partially sponsored by Labatt Breweries). Previously, the scoreboard was changed manually. In 1990, Labatt Park and its head groundkeeper Mike Regan, won the prestigious \\"Beam Clay Award\\" as the best natural-grass field in North America. Broadcasting the Tigers' games on TV London with veteran local sportscaster Pete James were former Tiger greats Mickey Lolich and later, Denny McLain. The 1990 London Tigers won the Eastern League title under manager Chris Chambliss (one of the Tigers' players was Travis Fryman), but the Tom Runnells-managed Tigers relocated to Trenton, New Jersey after the 1993 season, citing declining attendance. On January 20, 1990, In Houston, Texas, Labatt Park was named the \\"Beam Clay Baseball Diamond of the Year\\" for \\"excellence and professionalism in maintaining an outstanding professional baseball diamond\\"‚Äîdue to the outstanding groundskeeping work of City of London employee/supervisor, Mike Regan and his assistant Rob Garrett. The park was considered for the filming of the 1992 movie A League of Their Own starring Madonna and Geena Davis, but filming could not fit around the home schedule of the Double A London Tigers of the Eastern League. The London Werewolves of the fledgling Frontier League played at the park from 1999 to 2001, winning the Frontier League championship in 1999; Werewolves pitcher Brett Gray tossed 25 strikeouts on June 3, 2000 (home opener), against the Chillicothe (Ohio) Paints. The game's scorecard and Brett Gray's jersey were donated to the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame & Museum in St. Marys, Ontario, by Werewolves' General Manager John Kuhn. In 2000, former MLB star Ron LeFlore was hired as the manager of the Cook County Cheetahs of the Frontier League, visiting Labatt Park several times during the season. In 2001 after the circa-1937 main grandstand was demolished and a new, $1.97-million, wheelchair-accessible main grandstand was built (the park's fourth) and a new \\"pop-up\\" underground irrigation system was installed, the park was used as the chief baseball venue for the Canada Summer Games. In 2003 the park was also home to the London Monarchs of the short-lived Canadian Baseball League, which folded mid-season due to financial difficulties. The team's manager was former Major Leaguer Willie Wilson and featured such stars as first-baseman Francisco Cabrera and pitcher Amaury Telemaco. The league's inaugural game and homeopener for the London Monarchs was held at Labatt Park on May 21, 2003, and was televised nationally on The Score. It also featured a fly-over by the Canadian Snowbirds flying team. League Commissioner Fergie Jenkins was also in attendance. Beehive of activity Along with bicycle racing, Labatt Park has in the past been used for soccer, fastball, softball, high-school and men's football, track and field, wrestling, boxing, winter skating, political rallies, showjumping, civic receptions, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Musical Ride and a 21-gun salute to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II during her visit to London's Victoria Park on June 26, 1997. Currently, the park is home to the London Majors of the Intercounty League and the London Badgers junior team, as well as several other youth and adult baseball teams. The UWO Mustangs Baseball Club managed by former London Majors/AA London Tigers/AAA Toldedo Mud Hens pitcher Mike Lumley is using the park during the 2006 Ontario University Athletics (OUA) baseball season (in 2005, the Mustangs won the OUA baseball title at Labatt Park for the first time, beating Brock University) Badgers in the final best-of-three championship series. The Western Mustangs repeated as OUA champs in 2006, beating Brock two games to nothing (7-4, 5-0) at Labatt Park on October 21. It should also be noted that Ted Giannoulas, aka \\"The Famous Chicken\\" sports mascot, was born and raised in London, Ontario, and during the years 1965 to 1967 worked part-time at Labatt Park during baseball games changing the old manual scoreboard in right field for 25 cents a game. Roy McKay Clubhouse, home to the London Majors In 1996, the \\"Reasons for Designation\\" for the park under the Ontario Heritage Act were amended to include the circa-1937, tongue-and-groove clapboard clubhouse of the London Majors, renamed the \\"Roy McKay Clubhouse\\" on August 1, 1996 (McKay was born on August 1), by Majors' longtime player/owner Arden Eddie in honour of former pitcher, manager and coach Roy McKay who died on Christmas Day in 1995, six months after falling on the porch of his Waterloo Street home. Subsequently, a large commemorative rock and bronze plaque honouring Roy McKay, jersey #16, was installed at the front of the clubhouse. See a photo of the Roy McKay Clubhouse here. \\"I would like to be remembered for being a devoted son and brother, a loving husband, a great father and a damn good friend.\\"‚ÄîRoy McKay, 1933‚Äì1995 Norm Aldridge at Labatt Park in May 1998 during the fundraising ballgame, The Rumble at the Riverforks. Aldridge, trainer with the 1948 Majors, also has a baseball diamond named after him in northeast London, Ontario -- Norm Aldridge Field. PHOTO: Herb Walsh. To help raise money for a new cedar-shingle roof on the historic clubhouse, a ballgame dubbed \\"The Rumble at the Riverforks\\" was played at the park on May 31, 1998, featuring members of London city council, members of the local media and the London Majors' oldtimers. The game was organized by The Friends of Labatt Park, SCENE magazine and the London Majors. On June 18, 2005, veteran Intercounty Baseball League umpire Joe Serratore was married to bride Bren Ferguson at home plate before 200 friends and family members, with United Church minister Reverend Susan Eagle (who, at the time, was a member of London city council) officiating. The home-plate wedding ceremony is believed to be a first for the ballpark.  Labatt Park Reunion, 2005 On Saturday, July 23, 2005, the City of London in conjunction with the London Sports Council, the London Sports Oldtimers Association, the London Majors Baseball Club and The Friends of Labatt Park, organized a special, day- long event at the park to commemorate the city's 150th anniversary as an incorporated municipality (more than 10,000 residents) and the park's 128-year-old history. The event featured an open baseball clinic for youngsters run by the London Majors, vintage ball games, displays of park/ baseball memorabilia and a Majors' oldtimers' reunion. In 2006, London photo- historian Stephen Harding spent two days photographing the interior and exterior of the Roy McKay Clubhouse and presented his photos/ report to the City's heritage planner as City staff formulate plans to make additional repairs to the 70-year-old structure.  Got Milk? commercials spoof MLB steroid use In late September 2005, the San Francisco advertising firm of Goodby, Silverstein & Partners filmed a series of five, 30-second Got Milk? TV-commercials at Labatt Park, that subsequently ran during post-season play of Major League Baseball (MLB), starting on October 11. The commercials, which spoofed the ongoing steroid scandal in MLB had players \\"caught\\" using a \\"performance-enhancing substance\\"‚Äîmilk. The commercials were titled \\"Caught\\", \\"Batting Practice\\", \\"Tabloid\\", \\"Never Poured\\" and \\"Manager.\\" The commercial \\"Never Poured\\" was shortlisted at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival. From the get- go, MLB demanded that the commercials be taken off the air, but the popular commercials were subsequently re-released in December 2007 and ran through January 2008. The humorous commercials continued to run during the 2005 World Series, won in 4 straight games by Chicago. An on-line poll on a Houston, Texas-based Web site revealed that 75% of more than 23,000 poll respondents found the commercials to be funny and wanted them left on the air. Roadway Express's 2006‚Äì2007 baseball calendar Labatt Park is one of three featured baseball parks in the 16-month (September 2006 to December 2007) Roadway Express baseball calendar; Labatt Park is featured in the month of October 2007 \\"Times of Greatness\\" baseball calendar published by Roadway Express, based in Akron, Ohio. The print run of the calendars is 150,000. Roadway Express is also the sponsor of the \\"Times of Greatness\\" interactive, -long museum travelling coast to coast in the U.S. and Canada every year, showcasing Negro League history and artifacts. Roadway Express is also a sponsor of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City, Missouri. Bob Paige, a longtime driver for Roadway Express, is the son of Hall-of-Fame pitcher, Satchel Paige, who made a much-publicized visit to Labatt Park on June 30, 1954.

On July 1 (Canada Day), 2006, London held its second annual Baseball Day, organized by the City of London, The Friends of Labatt Park, Fanshawe Pioneer Village, the London Majors Baseball Club, the London Oldtimers' Sports Association, the London and District Baseball Association and the London Sports Council. The day featured an open, drop-in baseball clinic with the London Majors, historical displays in the Roy McKay Clubhouse, a 1923 Wurlitzer Military Band Organ (restored and owned and operated by Ken Vinen of Aylmer, Ontario), a vintage base ball game between Fanshawe Pioneer Village's London Tecumsehs and Bruce Huff's Thames River Ratz (the Ratz won 15-3), a pitch, hit and run competition and a doubleheader between the London Majors and the Toronto Maple Leafs of the Intercounty Baseball League (London won both games, 9-1 and 3-2). The scheduled fireworks (courtesy of the City of London) after the game over the adjacent riverforks were cancelled due to high winds. Instead, they were set off the following night on July 2.

The station is owned by Nexstar Media Group. The station's studios are located on the 18th floor of 303 East Wacker Drive in the Chicago Loop, while its transmitter is located in Elk Grove Village. Since around 1990, WGN has maintained a news/talk format. WGN does not broadcast in HD. WGN is the only radio station owned by Nexstar Media Group, which primarily owns television stations; it had been one of the flagship properties of Tribune Media, through its Tribune Broadcasting subsidiary, prior to its 2019 merger with Nexstar, and was co-owned with the Chicago Tribune, whose \\"World's Greatest Newspaper\\" slogan served as the basis for the WGN call sign, from 1924 to 2014. WGN is a clear channel Class A station operating with the maximum AM power in the United States of 50,000 watts, using a non-directional antenna. During daytime hours Illinois' mostly flat land and near-perfect ground conductivity gives WGN at least secondary coverage to almost two-thirds of Illinois (as far south as Springfield) as well as large slices of Wisconsin, Indiana, Michigan and Iowa. Under the right conditions, it can be heard as far as Windsor, Ontario, around 250 miles (400 km) away. During nighttime hours, it is audible over most of the eastern two-thirds of North America with a good radio, but is strongest in the central United States and Canada. The station also streams its programming on its website. WGN is responsible for the activation of the Chicago metropolitan area Emergency Alert System when hazardous weather alerts, disaster area declarations, and child abductions are issued. In addition to WGN-AM's live online stream the station also operates two online talk-oriented internet-online stream, when no program airs a continuous off-the-air audio loop is heard. Programming In addition to its talk programming (consisting of both topical and sports shows), WGN Radio broadcasts local news headlines, weather forecasts supplied by WGN-TV, traffic reports and sports headlines every half-hour on weekdays from 5:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. and every hour on nights and weekends. Also during weekdays, the radio station simulcasts the 4:00 a.m. hour of the WGN Morning News, as well as the WGN News at Ten and GN Sports: Game Night. Business topics are covered on the Wintrust Business Lunch with John Williams. WGN is one of the scant few news/talk radio stations in the country that broadcasts only locally produced talk shows, with a Sunday morning religious block featuring the only outside program on the station, The Lutheran Hour, as their sole syndicated program. It is the only all local talk station in Chicago, with WIND, WCPT and WLS all carrying several nationally syndicated talk shows on their schedules. WGN serves as the flagship radio outlet for Chicago White Sox baseball, Chicago Blackhawks hockey and Northwestern University football and men's basketball telecasts. WGN was best known for its long association with the Chicago Cubs from 1925 to 2014‚Äîthe last 56 years of that period as the exclusive flagship station. Following the 2014 season, Cubs radio broadcasts moved to CBS-owned WBBM. In 2018, WGN became the flagship station for Chicago's other MLB team, the White Sox. WGN was also the longtime Chicago outlet for Paul Harvey until his death on February 28, 2009. Shortly after Nexstar took control, the station began to broadcast national NFL play-by-play on Sunday afternoons from Compass Media Networks. The station continues to utilize ABC News Radio for national news as the network's Chicago affiliate, even after the network was taken in-house at the start of 2015 after several years of ownership by Citadel Broadcasting/Cumulus Media at the start of 2015. On September 1, 2020, WGN Radio dropped ABC News Radio in favor of being an \\"audio news hub\\" for NewsNation, the nightly primetime newscast of WGN America. History =WDAP= WGN was first licensed, with the sequentially issued call letters WDAP, on May 19, 1922 to Mid West Radio Central, Inc. in Chicago,\\"New Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, June 1, 1922, page 2. which was headed by Thorne Donnelley and Elliott Jenkins. The station was originally located at the Wrigley Building, although it moved to the Drake Hotel the following July.WGN: A Pictorial History, WGN, Inc., 1961, pages 9-16. In mid-1923 ownership was transferred to the Board of Trade,\\"Alterations and Corrections\\", Radio Service Bulletin, July 2, 1923, page 10. and the next year the Whitestone Company, managers of the Drake Hotel, took control.\\"Alterations and Corrections\\", Radio Service Bulletin, June 2, 1924, page 7. =WGN= The Chicago Tribune purchased WDAP, and on June 1, 1924 renamed it WGN.\\"Alterations and Corrections\\", Radio Service Bulletin, August 1, 1924, page 6. The distinctive call letters came from \\"World's Greatest Newspaper\\", a slogan used since 1911.The \\"World's Greatest Newspaper\\" slogan was first used in a February 1909 feature commemorating the 100th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's birth, which served as the motto from August 29, 1911 until December 31, 1976 (). This was the second Tribune-affiliated radio station to hold the WGN call letters. The original WGN began operating on the evening of March 29, 1924, after the newspaper took over programming of the former WJAZ.\\"W-G-N, Tribune Radio, Starts Tonight', Chicago Daily Tribune, March 29, 1924, pages 1, 11. Zenith had decided to move WJAZ to a suburban transmitter site. It sold the original WJAZ to the Edgewater Beach Hotel management, which changed the call letters to WEBH: (\\"Alterations and Corrections\\", Radio Service Bulletin, June 2, 1924, page 7). WEBH was eventually deleted in November 1928 when it was consolidated with KYW (\\"Strike out all particulars\\" Radio Service Bulletin, November 30, 1928, page 12.) The WGN call sign had been assigned to a Great Lakes vessel, SS Carl D. Bradley, however the ship's skipper (and namesake) agreed to relinquish it in order to free it for adoption by the newspaper, and the ship's call letters were changed to KFSI. Early programming was noted for its creativity and innovation. It included live music, political debates, comedy routines, and some of radio's first sporting event broadcasts, including the 1924 Indianapolis 500, and a live broadcast of the 1925 Scopes Trial from Dayton, Tennessee. In 1926, WGN broadcast Sam & Henry, a daily serial with comic elements created and performed by Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll. After a dispute with the station in 1927, Gosden and Correll took the program's concept and announcer Bill Hay across town to WMAQ and created the first syndicated radio show, Amos 'n' Andy. By the fall of 1928, the owners of the Tribune company and its sister publication, Liberty magazine, controlled two stations in addition to WGN in the Chicago area: WLIB and WTAS. On September 1, 1928 the Federal Radio Commission (FRC) ruled that this was two stations too many, and ordered that their operations be consolidated.Annual Report of the Federal Radio Commission For the Year Ended June 30, 1928, page 162. WTAS was deleted,\\"Strike out all particulars\\", Radio Service Bulletin, November 30, 1928, page 12. and the other two stations were merged with a dual call letter assignment of WGN-WLIB, although the latter call sign would be rarely if ever used. On May 15, 1933, after the FRC requested that stations using only one of their assigned call letters drop those that were no longer in regular use, WLIB was eliminated and the station reverted to just WGN.\\"Double Call Letters Are Being Eliminated\\", Washington (D.C.) Evening Star, June 25, 1933, Part 4, page 6. WGN's main studio in the Tribune Tower, c. 1930s -1940s. It could seat 600 people. On November 1, 1931, WGN's network affiliation changed from NBC to CBS as a result of NBC's purchase of a half- interest in WMAQ, which then became Chicago's NBC station. During this period, Count Cutelli installed one of the most advanced sound effects system to date into the WGN studios, the same system used in Hollywood films. On 1934, WGN served as a founding member of the Mutual Broadcasting System. On April 5, 1948, sister station WGN-TV Channel 9 signed on the air. In 1939, Carole Mathews, the \\"Miss Chicago\\" of 1938, launched her own WGN radio program Breakfast Time with Carole Mathews. She soon left for Hollywood, where she starred in films and television programs in a career that ended in 1968. After McCormick succumbed from pneumonia-related complications on April 1, 1955, ownership of WGN-TV-AM, the Chicago Tribune and the News Syndicate Company properties would transfer to the McCormick-Patterson Trust, assigned to the Robert R. McCormick Tribune Foundation in the names of the non-familial heirs of McCormick (whose two marriages never produced any children) and familial heirs of Patterson. (The trust was dissolved in January 1975, with a majority of the trust's former beneficiaries, including descendants of the McCormick and Patterson families, owning stock in the restructured Tribune Company entity ‚Äì which assumed oversight of all properties previously overseen by the trust ‚Äì afterward.) Officer Baldy and the WGN traffic copter in 1959. In November 1958, WGN became the first radio station in Chicago to broadcast helicopter traffic reports featuring Police Officer Leonard Baldy. Flying Officer Baldy was killed in a helicopter crash, while on duty, on May 2, 1960. Eleven years later, WGN suffered another helicopter-related tragedy when Flying Officer Irv Hayden and his pilot were killed on August 10, 1971, after their helicopter struck a utility pole in the Chicago suburb of Bellwood. In 1961, the WGN radio and television stations moved to a studio facility on West Bradley Place in the North Center neighborhood, a move undertaken for civil defense concerns in order to provide the station a safe base to broadcast in case of a hostile attack targeting downtown Chicago. WGN radio moved back to North Michigan Avenue in 1986, relocating its operations to a studio in the Pioneer Court extension (WGN-TV remained at the Bradley Place facility, where that station operates to this day). The former WGN annex onto Tribune Tower is now used as a retail space containing Dylan's Candy Bar. Over many decades, WGN was a \\"full service\\" radio station. The station played small amounts of music during the mornings and afternoon hours, moderate amounts of music on weekends during the day, aired midday and evening talk shows, and sports among other features. The station aired middle of the road (MOR) music until the 1970s, when its switched to more of an adult contemporary-type sound. Music programming was phased out during the 1980s, and by 1990, the station's lineup mainly consisted of talk shows. Some former well-known personalities on WGN include longtime morning hosts Wally Phillips, Bob Collins, Spike O'Dell, Paul Harvey and Roy Leonard. Orion Samuelson has been the station's farm reporter since 1960. Late-night hosts over the years have included Franklyn MacCormack, Ed \\"Chicago Eddie\\" Schwartz, Don Vogel and the husband-and-wife team of Steve King and Johnnie Putman. The Sousa Archives and Center for American Music at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign holds the WGN Radio Station Studio Orchestra Music Library and Records, 1925‚Äì1956, which consists of scripts, programs, production notes, correspondence, music library rental records, sheet music manuscripts, and music scores with annotations that document the WGN Studio Symphonic Orchestra from 1925 to 1956. = Events in the 21st century = WGN continues to recover from the controversial rule of former Tribune head Randy Michaels, who resigned under pressure in 2010 amid allegations of inappropriate and sexist behavior in the workplace, and former WGN Program Director Kevin Metheny. Industry observers described Metheny's tenure as one that nearly destroyed the venerable WGN, with staff moves that included replacing a popular evening host with radio rookie Jim Laski, a convicted felon. Metheny and Laski were both fired weeks after Michaels was forced to resign by a Tribune Board of Directors facing spiraling losses at the hands of Michaels' management style. In 2005, Tom Langmyer was appointed as vice president and general manager of WGN. On April 30, 2008, the station entered into a three-year deal to broadcast Chicago Blackhawks hockey games through the 2010‚Äì2011 season. On April 1, 2007, Chicago-based real estate investor Sam Zell announced plans to purchase the Tribune Company in an $8.2-billion leveraged buyout that gave Tribune employees stock and effective ownership of the company. The transaction and concurring privatization of the company was completed upon termination of Tribune stock at the close of trading on December 20, 2007. Prior to the sale's closure, WGN-TV was one of two commercial television stations in the Chicago market, not counting network-owned stations, to have never been involved in an ownership transaction (along with WCIU-TV, which has been owned by Weigel Broadcasting since its February 1964 sign-on). On December 8, 2008, Tribune filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, citing a debt load of around $13 billion ‚Äì making it the largest media bankruptcy in American corporate history ‚Äì that it accrued from the Zell buyout and related privatization costs as well as a sharp downturn in revenue from newspaper advertising. After a protracted four- year process, on December 31, 2012, Tribune formally exited from bankruptcy under the control of its senior debt holders, Oaktree Capital Management, JPMorgan Chase and Angelo, Gordon & Co.. On July 10, 2013, Tribune announced plans to split off its broadcasting and newspaper interests into two separate companies. WGN-TV and WGN Radio would remain with the original entity, which was renamed Tribune Media and was restructured to focus on the company's broadcasting, digital and real estate properties; the newspaper division ‚Äì which, in addition to the Chicago Tribune, included publications such as the Los Angeles Times, the South Florida Sun-Sentinel and the Baltimore Sun ‚Äì was spun off into the standalone entity Tribune Publishing (known as Tronc from June 2016 until the company reverted to its former name in October 2018). The split was completed on August 4, 2014, ending the Tribunes joint ownership with WGN-TV and WGN Radio after 66 and 94 years, respectively. However, WGN-TV continues to maintain a content partnership with the Tribune. In October 2008, WGN-TV began to provide forecasts for WGN radio (prepared by Tom Skilling and other members of the sister television station's weather staff), after it ended a ten-year forecast partnership with The Weather Channel. That year, morning host Spike O'Dell retired from radio; WGN then moved the station's midday host at the time, John Williams to the morning slot. Williams' former timeslot, 1-4 p.m. was left vacant for several months, with the station's other radio hosts filling in on a rotating basis ‚Äì including weekend host Nick Digilio, and Bob Sirott, who formerly hosted \\"The Noon Show\\" on the same station, in addition to a weekend program that is pre-recorded with his wife, Marianne Murciano (Sirott was also a prominent news anchor at NBC owned-and- operated station WMAQ-TV, channel 5, and later at Fox-owned WFLD, channel 32). In March 2009, longtime Chicago radio host Garry Meier was given an audition for the 1-4 p.m. slot. Meier hosted four shows, which is believed to have caused a surge in interest among younger people, who traditionally rarely listened to WGN. Chicago media message boards exploded with traffic and posts, many excited over a possible permanent Meier presence on the station. After the four Meier auditions, Jerry Springer was given a four-day stint as \\"guest host\\", followed by Rita Cosby a few weeks later. On April 2, 2009, WGN announced that Meier would join the station full-time as host of a program in the 1-4 p.m. slot (airing most weekdays when the program is not pre-empted by Chicago Cubs broadcasts); his first official show occurred that same day. On May 22, 2009, WGN announced the cancellation of The Kathy and Judy Show effective after that day's broadcast. The final show was largely a retrospective of the program's 20 years on WGN radio; this occurred shortly after the replacement of much of the station's weekend lineup. On June 15, 2009, the station announced that Greg Jarrett would become its new morning- drive host starting on June 22, with John Williams being shifted to Kathy and Judys former late morning timeslot. In June 2010, WGN announced the hiring of longtime Cincinnati-based host Mike McConnell from WLW for the late morning (8:30 a.m.-12:30 p.m.) slot, shifting Williams back to his original midday time slot (now from 12:30-3:00 p.m.) on August 9, 2010. Coinciding with the hire of Jarrett, WGN dropped its \\"News/Talk 720\\" brand and began identifying itself simply as \\"Chicago's WGN Radio 720.\\" This new identity was implemented in all station promos, and used by all on-air talent. On August 13, 2010, the station's branding changed again to \\"News 720 WGN.\\" In November, after the firing of controversial program director Kevin Metheny, Tom Langmyer instructed staff to identify the station as \\"720 WGN.\\" Weekend hosts Jerry Agar and the \\"News Junkie\\" Sean Wasson left the station, in a shift towards more general and less controversial talk programming. On December 2, 2011, WGN announced that Jonathon Brandmeier was named the new morning drive time host, effective December 9. With Brandmeier's addition to WGN radio's weekday lineup, the morning drive timeslot shifted to 5:30-9 a.m., followed by Mike McConnell from 9 a.m.-12 p.m., John Williams from 12-3 p.m., and Garry Meier from 3-7 p.m. News anchor Steve Bertrand moved to mornings with Brandmeier and Jim Gudas shifted to the midday/afternoon slot. Former morning host Greg Jarrett was released from the station. Overnight hosts Steve King and Johnnie Putman left WGN on December 9 after a week-long series of live \\"Farewell Celebration\\" shows. Bill Leff took over the midnight to 5:30 a.m. slot on December 12. 2011. In 2012, John Williams announced his departure from the station upon the December 31 expiration of his contract (leaving on December 21, 2012), in order to concentrate exclusively on his program on WCCO in Minneapolis instead of splitting time between stations. In October 2012, then back into Tribune Tower in October 2012. On December 17, 2012, WGN Radio executives announced that the long-running program \\"Extension 720\\", hosted by Dr. Milton J. Rosenberg, would end its 39-year run three days later on December 20. In June 2013, Tribune Broadcasting CEO Larry Wert hired Jimmy DeCastro as WGN radio's president and general manager. In addition, Bob Sirott and Marianne Murciano's program moved to the weekday lineup and Steve Cochran was announced to be returning to WGN. The changes are an attempt to shift WGN closer to the programming format it had prior to Kevin Metheney and Randy Michaels' tenure with WGN and Tribune, while placing more emphasis on new media; this included the move of Mike McConnell's program to the station's secondary Internet radio station WGN Plus (formerly WGN-2) until the remainder of his contract was bought out around October 10, 2013, the move of Jonathon Brandmeier's morning show to a new station branded \\"The G\\" (which has since launched as an additional Internet-only station but is planned to eventually move to an FM frequency to be acquired by Tribune) in favor of Cochran, and increased synergy with WGN-TV (including the replacement of WGN radio's \\"Voice of Chicago\\" slogan with WGN-TV's longtime slogan, \\"Chicago's Very Own\\"). On May 21, WGN Radio announced that their schedule would change again effective May 27, 2014, which includes the return of John Williams to the airwaves of WGN Radio that he will pretty much do the show live from Minneapolis, while still doing his afternoon show on WCCO 830. His time slot announced was 10:00 A.M to 12:00 P.M, which moved then mid morning hosts Bill Leff and Wendy Snyder to the afternoon drive from 3:00-7:00 p.m. Garry Meier would be moved to WGN.FM, with Steve Cochran's morning show getting expended by 1 hour, and Bob Sirott and Marianne Murciano still having their 12:00-3:00 p.m. show. On June 5, 2014, the Chicago Cubs announced that radio broadcasts of its games would move from WGN to WBBM for the 2015 season under a seven-year deal. The deal ends the team's 90-year association with WGN. On November 20, 2014, Chicago media blogger Robert Feder reported that WGN management planned to end operation of both WGWG-LP and internet station WGN.FM on December 31, 2014. Jonathan Brandmeier and Garry Meier were released and their programs canceled immediately, with repeat shows airing through the end of December. While Brandmeier was reportedly not under contract with Tribune Media at the time of his release, Meier's contract with Tribune continued through September 2015. On December 31, 2014, the WGN.FM website was redirected to the WGN Plus website, where Tribune offers various digital media content. WGWG-LP began an interim simulcast of WGN radio at 10 p.m. on December 31, 2014. The Chicago Tribune reported that the simulcast would continue through January 2015, after which Chicago-based Weigel Broadcasting was expected to assume operation of 87.7 FM; Weigel eventually began programming what is now WRME-LP on February 23, 2015. On October 5, 2016, Jimmy DeCastro announced he was planning to leave WGN Radio at the end of the month. He told Robert Feder \\"I've done everything I can to respect and build on the legacy of this amazing place, and I believe I accomplished everything I set out to do.\\" At the time of his leaving he had spent 3 years serving as the President and General Manager of WGN Radio. His last day at WGN Radio was October 31. He said he plans to focus on The Content Factory, his Evanston-based national syndication and new media company, and to expand into the area of sports representation. Larry Wert has said he has not decided on naming a successor to DeCastro, so for now the sales and programming operations will report directly to Wert. On July 25, 2017, it was reported that WGN would leave Tribune Tower in 2018 and relocate to a new studio and office across the Chicago River. The station began using its new studios on Wacker Drive for news reports in May 2018, with the final show originating from Tribune Tower on June 18, 2018. On February 14, 2018, WGN was named the new flagship station of the Chicago White Sox, who were left without a station after Cumulus Media voided their contract to air on WLS as part of their Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. The agreement is for three years. Tribune Media was acquired by Nexstar Media Group for $4.1 billion in September 2019, marking the first time since 1924 that WGN radio would not be owned by any iteration of the Tribune Company. The sale made WGN the only radio property owned by Nexstar, which primarily owns television stations; in an interview with Crain's Chicago Business in December 2018, shortly after the deal was announced, Nexstar CEO Perry Sook stated that he \\"doesn‚Äôt have an allergic reaction to radio\\" and that there were no immediate plans to sell WGN radio, adding that he did not expect Nexstar to acquire additional radio stations. Under Nexstar, several changes were made to the station's lineup, management, and branding. Bob Sirott was hired to replace Steve Cochran during morning drive hours, longtime mid-day duo Bill Leff and Wendy Snyder were ousted, and at a later date, evening host Justin Kaufmann was let go as well. These staffing changes were made over the course of months after Sean Compton began to oversee radio operations as Nexstar's Executive Vice President of WGN America, WGN Radio & Director of Content Acquisition. Morning producer Mary Boyle was appointed General Manager of the station after former Station Manager Todd Manley was terminated on the first day of Nextar's takeover. Veteran Chicago News Anchor Bill Kurtis was replaced in his role as voiceover talent by New York based voiceover artist Steve Kamer. Similarly, new radio jingles from JAM Creative Productions and sister company PAMS of Dallas were introduced to the station. Cuts from JAM jingle packages Top News, Talktrax, Talking Points, Non-Stop Power, You'll Like Our Style, Follow The Leader, and First Step are regularly featured in station identifications, sounders, and promotions. Nexstar also dropped their affiliation with ABC News Radio and instead is supplying national news updates for WGN America's national newscast, NewsNation with WGN newscasters and audio from Nexstar-owned television stations. =Notable current on-air personalities= * Bob Sirott ‚Äì morning drive host * John Williams - midday host 9AM-1PM https://wgnradio.com/john-williams/ * Anna Davlantes - midday host 1PM-3PM https://wgnradio.com/anna-davlantes/ * John Records Landecker - evening host 7PM-10PM (Starting September, 28, 2020) =Notable former on-air personalities= * Jonathon Brandmeier * Garry Meier * Marianne Murciano * Dave Hoekstra ‚Äì Nocturnal Journal host * Ji Suk Yi ‚Äì Monday-Friday Evening Host host now Digital anchor for NewsNation (WGN America). * Roe Conn ‚Äì afternoon drive host * Nick Digilio ‚Äì Former Sunday-Thursday overnight host 11PM-4AM and fill-in References External links * WGN Radio ‚Äì official website ** WGN Radio schedule * (covering 1927-1981) GN Nexstar Media Group News and talk radio stations in the United States Radio stations established in 1922 Chicago Bears broadcasters Chicago Blackhawks broadcasters Chicago Cubs broadcasters Chicago White Sox broadcasters Chicago Stags Mutual Broadcasting System American radio stations with a three-letter call sign ","title":"WGN (AM)"},{"id":"605275","text":"The Battle of Longewala (4‚Äì7 December 1971) was one of the first major engagements in the western sector during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, fought between assaulting Pakistani forces and Indian defenders at the Indian border post of Longewala, in the Thar Desert of Rajasthan state in India.The battle was fought between 120 Indian soldiers accompanied by 4 Hunter fighter aircraft and 2000-3000 Pakistani soldiers accompanied by 30-40 tanks. A (reinforced) Company of the Indian Army's 23rd Battalion, Punjab Regiment, commanded by Major Kuldip Singh Chandpuri, was left with the choice of either attempting to hold out until reinforced, or fleeing on foot from a Pakistani mechanised infantry force. Choosing the former, Chandpuri ensured that all his assets were correctly deployed, and made the most use of his strong defensive position, as well as weaknesses created by errors in enemy tactics. He was also fortunate in that an Indian Air Force forward air controller was able to secure and direct aircraft in support of the post's defence until reinforcements arrived six hours later. The Pakistani commanders made several questionable decisions, including a failure of their strategic intelligence to foresee availability of Indian strike aircraft in the Longewala area, exercising operational mobility with little or no route reconnaissance, and conducting a tactical frontal assault with no engineer reconnaissance.https://theprint.in/opinion/the-1971-battle-of-longewala-a- night-of-confusion-sam-manekshaws-order-pakistans-folly/329321/ This led to the Pakistani brigade group being left extremely vulnerable to air attack, vehicles becoming bogged in terrain not suitable for the movement of armoured vehicles as they tried to deploy off a single track, these being more susceptible to enemy fire by using external fuel storage in tactical combat, attempting to execute a night attack over unfamiliar terrain, and infantry being surprised by obstacles to troop movement causing confusion and stalling the attack during the crucial hours of darkness, when the assaulting infantry still had a measure of concealment from Indian small arms and infantry support weapon fire.  Background  The main thrust of the Indian Army during the 1971 war was directed towards the eastern theatre, with the western sector envisaged as a holding operation to prevent the Pakistan Army from achieving any success that would allow the President of Pakistan, Yahya Khan, any bargaining tool to trade against the captured territories in the east. By the last week of November 1971, the Indian Army had launched offensive manoeuvres at Atgram against Pakistani border posts and communications centres along the eastern border. The Mukti Bahini also launched an offensive on Jessore at this time. It was clear to Islamabad by this time that open conflict was inevitable, and that East Pakistan was indefensible in the long run. Yahya Khan chose at this point to try to protect Pakistan's integrity and to hold India by Ayub Khan's strategy ‚Äì \\"The defence of East Pakistan lies in the West\\".Failure in Command: Lessons from Pakistan's Indian Wars, 1947‚Äì1999. Faruqui A. Defense Analysis Vol.17, No. 1, 1 April 2001  Prelude  = The Western sector = Khan's policy made the assumption that an open conflict with India would not last long due to international pressure, and that since East Pakistan was undefendable, the war-effort should be concentrated on occupying as large an area of Indian territory as possible as a bargaining tool at the negotiating table. To this end, Gen Tikka Khan had proposed an offensive into India, and the PAF's \\"overriding priority was to give maximum support to this offensive\\". The initial plans for the offensive called for at least a temporary cover of air dominance by the PAF under which Khan's troops could conduct a lightning campaign deep into Western India before digging in and consolidating their positions. To support Khan's troops, the PAF had launched pre-emptive strikes on the evening of 3 December that led to the formal commencement of hostilities. In the western theatre, the town of Rahim Yar Khan, close to the international border, formed a critical communication centre for Khan's forces and, situated on the Sindh ‚Äî Punjab railway, remained a vulnerable link in Khan's logistics. The fall of Rahim Yar Khan to Indian forces would cut off the rail as well as road link between Sindh and Punjab, starving Khan's forces of fuel and ammunition delivered to Karachi. Indian battle plans called for a strike across the international border with the 12th Indian division towards Islamgarh through Sarkari Tala, subsequently advancing through Baghla to secure Rahim Yar Khan, which would not only destabilise the Pakistani defences in the Punjab, but also in the Jammu & Kashmir Sector, allowing the planned Indian offensive in the Shakargarh sector to sweep the Pakistani forces trapped there. Pakistan, which envisaged the Punjab as an operational centre, had a strong intelligence network in the area and planned to counter its own comparatively weak strength on the ground with a pre- emptive strike through Kishangarh towards the divisional headquarters south of Ramgarh. Pakistani intelligence was able to infiltrate the operations area posing as local people and pass on information. However, these sources failed to pass on information on the Longewala post which, originally a BSF post, was now held by a company of the Punjab Regiment. Longewala formed a strategic point en route to capturing vast tracts of land and also a pivotal theatre of war in engaging India on the western front. = Tactical plan = Pakistan's tactical plan was based on the assumption that an attack in the area would help Pakistan's 1st Armoured Divisions task in the Sri Ganganagar area. Pakistan High command also felt that it was important to protect the North- South road link which they felt was vulnerable as it was close to the border. A Combined Arms Plan was decided upon. This involved two Infantry Brigades and two Armoured Regiments. A separate division, the 18 Division, was formed for this purpose. 18 Division Operation Orders required one Infantry Brigade (206) with an Armoured Regiment (38 Cavalry) to capture and establish a firm base at Longewala, a junction on the Indian road system and 51st Infantry Brigade and the 22nd Cavalry (Pakistan Army Armoured Corps) to operate beyond Longewala to capture Jaisalmer.Correspondence from Lt. Col. (Retd) H.K. Afridi Defence Journal, Karachi. feb-mar99 URL accessed on 22 September 2006 The Pakistani plan was to reach Longewala, Ramgarh and Jaisalmer. The plan was far-fetched from the start, if only because it called for a night attack to be conducted over terrain that was not preceded by route or engineer reconnaissance, and the armoured troops were therefore unaware of the ground surface that could not support rapid movement towards the objective. As the day unfolded, Longewala would stand out as one of the biggest losses in a battle for Pakistan despite overwhelming superiority before commencement of the battle, largely due to the vehicles becoming bogged down in soft sand. = Indian defensive planning = On the Indian side, the post was held by A Company, 23rd Battalion, Punjab Regiment, led by Maj. Kuldip Singh Chandpuri, the defences occupying a high sand dune which dominated the area that was largely intractable to vehicles. The post was surrounded by a barbed wire fence of three stands. The rest of the battalion was located at Sadhewala, 17 km north- east of the Longewala post. Chandpuri commanded an infantry company reinforced by a section each of MMGs and L16 81mm mortar, and one Jeep-mounted RCL. His two other recoilless rifle teams of the anti-tank section were under training at the battalion headquarters. Major Chandpuri also had under his command a four-man team of the camel Border Security Force division.Shorey A. Sainik Samachar. Vol.52, No.4, 16‚Äì 28February 2005 The Longewala post had no armoured vehicles, but artillery support was available from a battery of 170 Field Regiment (Veer Rajput) tasked in direct support to the battalion, and 168 Field Regiment which had been deployed to the area in secrecy just a day earlier. The direct support battery was attached to 168 Field Regiment and served as its \\"Sierra\\" Battery. Immediately after PAF strikes on Indian airfields on 3 December, Chandpuri dispatched a 20-man strong patrol under 2Lt. Dharam Veer Bhan to Boundary Pillar (BP) 638, on the international border. This patrol was to play an important part in detecting the advances of Pakistani forces.  Battle  One of the three HAL Marut used by the IAF against Pakistani armour at Longewala During the night of the 4th, 2Lt. Dharam Veer Bhan's platoon, while on a patrol, detected noises across the border that suggested a large number of armoured vehicles approaching.p.177, Nayar These were soon confirmed by reports ‚Äî from the Army's Air Observation Post aircraft flown by Maj. Atma Singh ‚Äî in the area of a 20 km long armoured column on the track leading to the post advancing in the general direction of the Longewala post.p.239, Rao Directing 2Lt. Dharam Veer Bhan's patrol to trail the advancing armoured column, Chandpuri got in touch with battalion headquarters requesting urgent reinforcements and armour and artillery support. Battalion HQ gave him the choice of staying put, and containing the attack as much as possible, or carrying out a tactical retreat of the company to Ramgarh, as reinforcements would not be available for at least six hours. Considering that Chandpuri's command had no transportation, and was facing a mobile enemy, he decided to maintain the defensive position of the post where his troops at least had the benefit of prepared defensive works, rather than conducting a withdrawal at night that was a far riskier option. The Pakistani forces began their attack at 12:30 am.p.83, Imprint As the offensive approached the lone outpost, Pakistani artillery opened up across the border with medium artillery guns, killing five of the ten camels from the BSF detachment. As the column of 45 tanks neared the post, Indian defences, lacking the time to lay a prepared minefield, laid a hasty anti-tank minefield as the enemy advanced, one infantryman being killed in the process.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/Years-later-Longewala- reminds-the-do-or-die-battle/articleshow/27554710.cmsp.42, Sharma The Indian infantry held their fire until the leading Pakistani tanks had approached to 15‚Äì30 metres before firing their PIATs. They accounted for the first two tanks on the track with their Jeep-mounted 106 mm M40 recoilless rifle, with one of its crew being killed during the engagement.There is a suggestion that there were two RCL-armed Jeeps at the post This weapon proved quite effective because it was able to engage the thinner top armour of the Pakistani tanks from its elevated position, firing at often stationary, bogged down vehicles. In all, the post defenders claimed 12 tanks destroyed or damaged. The initial Pakistani attack stalled almost immediately when the infantry discovered the barbed wire which was unseen in the night, and interpreted it to signify a minefield. Firing for the Indian RCL crews was made easier by the flames of fires when the spare fuel tanks on the Pakistani tanks, intended to supplement their internal capacity for the advance to Jaisalmer, exploded, at once providing ample light for Indians located on higher ground, and creating a dense acrid smoke screen at ground level for the Pakistani infantry, adding to the confusion. Two hours were lost as Pakistani sappers were brought up, only to discover there was no minefield. However, at this time Pakistani infantry were required to make another attack, from a different direction, but in the dawn light. The Pakistani advance then attempted to surround the post two hours later by vehicles getting off the road, but many vehicles, particularly armoured personnel carriers and tanks, in trying to soften up the Indian defenders before attacking, became bogged down in the soft sand of the area surrounding the post. Throughout the engagement, Maj. Chandpuri continued to direct the supporting artillery fire. Although massively outnumbering the Indian defenders, and having surrounded them, the Pakistani troops were unable to advance over open terrain on a full-moon night, under small arms and mortar fire from the outpost. This encouraged the Indians not to give up their strong defensive position, frustrating the Pakistani commanders. As dawn arrived, the Pakistan forces had still not taken the post, and were now having to do so in full daylight. In the morning, the Indian Air Force was finally able to direct some HAL HF-24 Maruts and Hawker Hunter aircraft to assist the post; they were not outfitted with night vision equipment, and so were delayed from conducting combat missions until dawn.p.100, Nordeen With daylight, however, the IAF was able to operate effectively, with the strike aircraft being guided to the targets by the airborne Forward Air Controller (FAC) Maj. Atma Singh in a HAL Krishak.An IAF pilot's account of the battle , Suresh The Indian aircraft attacked the Pakistani ground troops with the 16 Matra T-10 rockets and 30 mm cannon fire on each aircraft. Without support from the Pakistan Air Force, which was busy elsewhere, the tanks and other armoured vehicles were easy targets for the IAF's Hunters. The range of the 12.7 mm anti-aircraft heavy machine guns mounted on the tanks was limited and therefore ineffective against the Indian jets. Indian air attacks were made easier by the nature of the barren terrain. Many IAF officers later described the attack as a 'turkey shoot' signifying the lopsidedness. By noon the next day, the assault ended completely, having cost Pakistan 22 tanks claimed destroyed by aircraft fire, 12 by ground anti-tank fire, and some captured after being abandoned, with a total of 100 vehicles claimed to have been destroyed or damaged in the desert around the post. The Pakistani attack was first halted, and then Pakistani forces were forced to withdraw when Indian tanks from the division's cavalry regiment, the 20th Lancers, commanded by Col. Bawa Guruvachan Singh, along with the 17th battalion, Rajputana Rifles, launched their counter-offensive to end the six-hour engagement. Longewala had proved to be one of the defining moments in the war.  Aftermath  The battle of Longewala saw heavy Pakistani losses and few Indian casualties. Since the Indians were able to use the defenders' advantage, they managed to inflict heavy losses on the Pakistanis. Indian casualties in the battle were two soldiers along with one of their jeep mounted recoilless rifles knocked out. Pakistani losses were 200 soldiers killed. The Pakistanis suffered the loss of 34 tanks destroyed or abandoned, and lost 500 additional vehicles. The judicial commission set up at the end of war recommended the commander of 18 Division, Maj. Gen. Mustafa, to be tried for negligence during the war. Notwithstanding the Indian victory, there were intelligence and strategic failures on both sides. India's intelligence failed to provide warning of such a large armoured force in the western sector. Moreover, the defending post was not heavily armed to neutralise the enemy. Finally, they did not push home the advantage by destroying the fleeing Pakistani tanks while the IAF had them on the run. They did, however destroy or capture some 36 tanks, remaining one of the largest disproportionate tank casualties for one side in a single battle after World War II. Invading Pakistan troops meanwhile, had underestimated the Longewala post's defensive capability due to the difficulty of approach over sand, conducting the attack at night and in full-moon light, against stiff resistance encountered there from a well prepared defensive position located on a dominant height. Attacking with virtually no air cover, they took too long to close for an assault on the position, and failed to anticipate availability of Indian close air support. Given that Pakistan's Sherman tanks and T-59/Type 59 Chinese tanks were slow on the sandy Thar desert, some military analysts have opined that the attack may have been poorly planned and executed given the terrain. Some Pakistani tanks suffered engine failures due to overheating in trying to extricate themselves, and were abandoned. The open desert battleground provided little to no cover for the tanks and infantry from air attacks. The plan to capture Longewala may have been good in conception, but failed due to lack of air cover. As a result, two tank regiments failed to take Longewala. MVC. For his part, the Indian company commander, Maj. (later Brig.) Kuldip Singh Chandpuri, was decorated with India's second highest gallantry award, the Maha Vir Chakra. Several other awards were earned by members of the defending company, and the battalion's commander. On the other hand, the Pakistani divisional commander was dismissed from service. However, the commander of the Pakistani 51 Brigade who mounted the daring attack and crossed into Indian territory was later awarded Pakistan's high award of the Sitara-e-Imtiaz. British media reported the defence of Longewala. James Hatter compared the Battle of Longewala as to Battle of Thermopylae in his article Taking on the enemy at Longewala describing it as the deciding moment of the 1971 war. Similarly, Field Marshal R.M. Carver, the British Chief of the Imperial General Staff, visited Longewala a few weeks after the war to learn the details of the battle from Maj. Chandpuri. In the early twenty-first century the battle was the subject of disagreement, some officers of the time ascribing all the combat success to the air force. This led to Kuldip Singh Chandpuri suing for a token amount of one rupee.  In popular culture  The Battle of Longewala was depicted in the 1997 Bollywood film Border, which was directed by J.P. Dutta and starred Sunny Deol as Maj. Kuldip Singh Chandpuri, Jackie Shroff as Wg. Cdr. M.S. Bawa, Sunil Shetty as Capt. Bhairon Singh (BSF), and Akshaye Khanna as 2Lt. Dharam Veer Bhan.p.17, Alter The main criticism of the movie was that it showed Indian forces being in a terrible position before any sort of help came from the Indian Air Force. The movie also exaggerates the casualties of Indian soldiers for dramatic purposes. This was not the case in the real incident as Indian forces had defended a position on a height that commanded the area, and were able to defend it effectively due to tactical mistakes made by the Pakistani commanders. This resulted in only two sepoys being killed before combat ceased. Indian troops were later able to capture damaged or abandoned Pakistani tanks.p.17-18, Alter  See also  * Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 * Timeline of the Bangladesh Liberation War * Military plans of the Bangladesh Liberation War * Mitro Bahini order of battle * Pakistan Army order of battle, December 1971 * Evolution of Pakistan Eastern Command plan * 1971 Bangladesh genocide * Operation Searchlight * Indo-Pakistani wars and conflicts * Military history of India * List of military disasters * List of wars involving India  Citations and notes   References  * Indivisible Air Power, Strategic Analysis, Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, 1984, v.8, 1185‚Äì1202 * Imprint, Justified Press, 1972, v.12:7‚Äì12 (Oct 1972 ‚Äì Mar 11973) * Alter, Stephen, Amritsar to Lahore: A Journey Across the India- Pakistan Border, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2000 * Nordeen, Lon O., Air Warfare in the Missile Age, Smithsonian Institution Press, 1985 * Suresh, Kukke, Wg.

The same year, Matheson played guitar for the role of Luke Shand, a youthful rocker helping to invigorate an old band in the film Still Crazy. He continued with a leading role in the British hit Tube Tales, which led to his first commercialized film, Bodywork, starring as a market trader framed for murder, with Beth Winslet, Charlotte Coleman, and Clive Russell. In 2000 he starred in Canone Inverso set in the 1930s, as Jeno Varga, a young man who falls in love with a pianist; he learnt the violin for this role.

Matheson admitted that he had occasionally taken jobs that weren't his first choice in order to make ends meet. Time constraints when filming were a problem, \\"you miss process; process is where results and creative things happen and you discover.

He acknowledged that he was occasionally nervous when performing, wishing that he could be in control of himself, adding that in acting one has to ‚Äúlet go‚Äù and that ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt guarantee what happens‚Äù. He also found that the best actors have difficulties with a poor script: \\"My dad once asked me: ‚ÄòWhat is the most difficult thing about being an actor?‚Äô and I told him that it‚Äôs all about trying to make bad writing work.

The OS-tan are the moe anthropomorphism/personification of several operating systems by heterogeneous amateur Japanese artists. The OS- tan are typically depicted as women, with the OS-tan representative of Microsoft Windows operating systems usually depicted as sisters of varying ages. The -tan element in the term is a hypocoristic suffix from Japanese. Though initially appearing only in fan work, the OS-tan proved popular enough that Microsoft branches in Singapore and Taiwan used the OS-tan concept as the basis for ad campaigns for Internet Explorer and Microsoft Silverlight, respectively. History The concept of the OS-tan is reported to have begun as a personification of the common perception of Windows Me (Released in 2000 by Microsoft as the 9x counterpart to Windows 2000) as unstable and prone to frequent crashes. Discussions on Futaba Channel likened this to the stereotype of a fickle, troublesome girl and as this personification expanded Me-tan was created and followed by the other characters. One of the early works to predominantly feature the OS-tan was an interactive Flash animation showing a possible intro to an imaginary anime show known as Trouble Windows. A fansub of this was eventually created and is partly responsible for the spread of the OS-tan to English language imageboards. The OS-tan is not an original concept and are pre-dated by Toy's iMac Girl, who was featured on a series of desktops released between August 1998 and March 1999. Commercial products Ohzora Publishing produced one book based on OS-tan characters, titled . It includes illustrations by over 25 contributors. It also includes 95-tan, ME-tan, XP-tan figures, titled OS Girl 95, OS Girl me, OS Girl XP respectively, but include a molded space for 2k-tan (named OS Girl 2K). ME-tan, 2K-tan, XP-tan were designed by GUHICO of Stranger Workshop, while 95-tan was designed by Fujisaki Shiro from H.B.Company. Parthenon Production Limited, company had commercialized Pink Company's OS-tan products. MALINO from Deja Vu ArtWorks produced the Me Document and Shared Folder! trilogy, which were sold in digital format. Japanese version of Windows 7 Ultimate DSP Edition includes the unofficial Nanami Madobe mascot. This inspired Microsoft Taiwan to launch an official mascot for Microsoft Silverlight, Hikaru. This was followed up by giving Hikaru \\"sisters\\", Lei, Aoi, and Yu. A special package of the Japanese Windows 7 Ultimate DSP Edition, called the Touch Mouse Artist Edition or Touch Mouse Limited Edition Artist Series, came with an animated tutorial Windows theme (with custom sounds and three desktop backgrounds) featuring Madobe Nanami. In 2009, an Ubuntu-based comic titled Ubunchu! was serialized in Kantan Ubuntu!, a spinoff from Weekly ASCII magazine. It was authored by Hiroshi Seo, with English version translated by Fumihito Yoshida, Hajime Mizuno, Martin Owens, Arturo Silva, and Anton Ekblad. Tan suffix The Japanese suffix is a mispronunciation of , an informal, intimate, and diminutive honorific suffix for a person, used for friends, family, and pets. In this case, the mispronunciation is used intentionally to achieve the contrived cute or charming effect that is commonly associated with its use by young children and is also sometimes added to the names of non-mascot characters. The personifications as a whole are commonly simply called mascots or mascot characters, and as such the -tan suffix itself means nothing outside its role as an honorific and its implications of cuteness. Normal suffixes, including -san, -chan, and -kun are also used in the name of some OS-tan, depending on the character and the speaker's preference; or the suffix may be omitted entirely. New Generation OS-tans =Windows 10= The name of the Windows 10 mascot was officially introduced as T≈çko (or Touko) Madobe on 31 July 2015. As confirmed on the character's official Facebook page, her name is a homonym for one of the readings for the Japanese word for 'ten': . Her name was chosen by fans through an online poll. According to her fictional profile, her origins are the Madobe family and she is set 100 years in the future. She likes online gaming and supporting others. Her personal traits are being an excellent student, and expanding her knowledge on technology. Her manager often worries since she‚Äôs a bit spontaneous. She also enjoys cheering on people who are working hard and doing their best. She has a part-time job at the Akibano Custom Computer Company where she is a rookie. This level of back story is rather unusual for OS-tan. =Windows 8.1= The Japanese Windows 8.1 Pro DSP edition Madobe Family version by Windows Navi+ (Techno-Alliance Corp.) is a limited (1000 units) version of Windows 8.1 Pro 32/64-bit edition with three types of Madobe family picture password wallpapers, Madobe character voices (Nanami, Y≈´, Ai, Claudia), Madobe family complete edition Windows theme pack, previously unpublished Madobe family designs, Final Pasocom Data Hikkoshi 9+ licence key, Skype three-month free trial, historical Windows logo stickers (XP, Vista, 7, 8). Other editions include a Memorial Pack version without voice, theme pack, stickers (6191 units); a 64-bit Windows Memorial Pack version with a Sculpt Mobile Mouse with Nanami decor (810 units). These editions were available for preorder on 2013-10-04 with release date on 2013-10-18. As part of the market launch, a Facebook draw of 8 followers took place when follower count reaches 80001; and total Twitter follower count for Y≈´ and Ai reach 8001, where winners receive Y≈´- and Ai-themed prizes. Additional types of Windows 8.1 Pro DSP edition Madobe family theme packs were also sold by Ark (TowerHill), ZOA Corporation, Tsukumo (Project White), Dospara, Buy More (Unit.com), Big Camera (Sofmap), and PC One. These versions include two types of wallpapers (Christmas, New Year), theme pack with system voices. =Windows 8= The Japanese Windows 8 Pro DSP editions were released in Madobe Y≈´ (or Yuu, ) and Madobe Ai () editions by Windows Navi+ (Techno- Alliance Corp.). Both versions (4,000 units per character, thus 8,000 total) include a Microsoft Wedge touch mouse with the Windows 8 logo, character- specific Windows theme (three theme pack wallpapers, event sounds in the respective character's voice), picture password images. In addition, Limited Akihabara Editions (444 units per character, 888 total), sold in Tokyo's Akihabara shopping district, include Madobe Ai/Y≈´ edition of Microsoft Wedge Touch Mouse, an alternate character-specific event sound samples and theme pack and an alternate wallpaper for its respective character. Nipponbashi versions (500 units per character), sold in Nipponbashi in Osaka, include Microsoft Wedge touch mouse (with Ai and Y≈´ decal), three theme pack wall papers (two common and one character-specific), and Y≈´ or Ai event sounds. The Nipponbashi packages include different art. The 32/64-bit version availability depends on retailer. Asuka Nishi voices the short-haired Y≈´, while Nao Tamura voices the long-haired Ai. The Windows 8 Can Edition from Unitcom (available for the first 2,888 copies) included notepad, T-shirt, two-way mouse pad, pocket media case, smart phone stand cleaning, two-way PC cleaner, Y≈´ and Ai badges, and a freeze blanket. The extended fictional Madobe family tree detailed that Y≈´ is the older sister, and their parents are Eiichi () from the Netsu (Ê†πÊ¥•) family and Shii () from the Madobe family. Y≈´ and Ai were said to have a birthdate of 18 November 1996 (Windows CE's release date) with age 15, with height of 152 cm. This conflicts with other back-story materials suggesting that Ai is the younger sister. MasatakaP and Electrocutica produced a Windows 8 music video titled \\"Through the Window\\", featuring Madobe characters Nanami, Y≈´ (in silhouette), and Claudia. The video was presented as the opening to Microsoft's keynote on the second day of Windows Developer Days in Japan. In 2012 and 2013, Windows Navi+ (Techno-Alliance Corp.) also created separate Twitter accounts for Ai and Y≈´, respectively. Two theme songs for Y≈´ and Ai ‚Äì \\"Mir8cle Days\\" () and \\"Donna Mirai Demo\\" () were unveiled on 15 June 2013, and sold as a CD bundled with Windows 8 Pro DSP Edition, sold at TwinBox Akihabara. =Windows 7= Akiba PC reported that the first 7777 copies of Japanese Windows 7 Ultimate DSP editions include special wallpaper and sound sets for a character called , voiced by Nana Mizuki. The character was designed by Wakaba. The premium set includes a Windows 7 theme featuring 3 Nanami wallpapers, 19 event sound sets, CD with 5 extra Nanami sounds. Regular DSP edition includes a digest Windows 7 theme including a Nanami wallpaper, an event sound set; the preorder users can also download an extra Nanami wallpaper and 6 event sound sets. This makes it the first OS-tan marketed by the company producing the operating system. In addition, the character also got its own Twitter account. During the initial sales event of the Windows 7 DSP edition, the official profile of the character has also been revealed. It shows Madobe Nanami was born in 1992-04-06 (release date of Windows 3.1) 17 years of age(at the time of release), who lives in Chiyoda, Tokyo. Nanami is among an extended family of 16 members, and she has elder brother named Goichi (Âêæ‰∏Ä), elder sister named Mutsumi („ÇÄ„Å§„Åø), mother named Mikaho (Áæé‰Ω≥Á©ó) from Madobe (Á™ìËæ∫) family, father named Kyuuachi (Á©∂ÂÖ´) from Shirato (ÁôΩÊà∏) family. Nanami and her cousin Claudia Madobe („ÇØ„É≠„Éº„Éâ(Ëîµ‰∫∫)) later appeared in Microsoft's Cloud Girl comic strip. Original OS-tans =Windows Vista= Windows Vista's most distinguishing characteristic is usually her horn-shaped pigtails (some variants have up to four pigtails) and heterochromatic eyes. Silver or white hair appears to be the most frequent, although light blue and black are also seen. A common costume design was a white and red sailor fuku and stockings. Since the release of more details about Vista's interface, her look has changed slightly. A black maid's outfit is now emerging in popularity (which matches the new default Vista color scheme), as well as a circular Windows logo hair clip, identical to the new Start Menu button in Vista. There also seems to be a more finalized version who has a hair color similar to that of Vista wallpapers, with a range from light blue, to yellow, to green. She also wears a type of long coat (which only covers her left and right sides) which are transparent to imitate that of the Aero glass effect. =Windows XP= XP- tan is a dark-haired girl with ribbons in her hair and an \\"XP\\" hair ornament typically worn on the left side. As Windows XP is criticized for bloating a system and being very pretty without being as useful, XP-tan is commonly depicted wearing tight clothing with big breasts. Additionally, as a reference to the memory usage of Windows XP, she is often seen eating or holding an empty rice bowl labeled \\"Memory\\". Some variants include a version for XP Home known as \\"Homeko\\" who has green hair which she wears in a short ponytail with two large XP-shaped hairclips that cover her ears, as well as a less common variation representing Windows XP Media Center Edition. The outfits worn by the two main variants are based on the loading lines at the Windows splash screen during startup. =Windows 2000= Although a few variants exist, the most common operating system represented is Windows 2000 Professional. She is typically drawn as an intelligent, professional, reserved looking woman with short blue hair, glasses, and hair clips that resemble cat ears flanking a small white bonnet or ruffle, similar to a maid's bonnet, that shows the Windows logo. Her outfit resembles a swimsuit suggesting the Windows logo colors worn with long blue coat, alluding to the popular opinion that Windows 2000 is the most stable and dependable of the Windows operating systems. Due to the greater stability of Win2K compared with WinME, which was released near 2000, 2K-tan is often described as the guardian of ME-tan. The particular shade of blue used in most drawings is similar to the default Windows 2000 desktop color. =Windows ME= The design of ME-tan, the personification of Windows Me, is very much in line with the Japanese concept of kawaii or cuteness. Her design has changed little from the artist's original designs and is depicted with green hair in long pigtails wearing a maid outfit with a \\"!\\" badge on the front reminiscent of the Windows Me Active Desktop Recovery screen, often shown after rebooting from a system crash in Me. While she is considered to be a hard worker, webcomics often depict her failing at anything she tries to do, often literally crashing and irritating her sisters. When she is not frozen or out of control, she tends to do things showing a lack of common sense or knowledge, such as putting a soda can into a microwave oven or defending herself by swinging a Welsh onion. =Windows 98 and 98SE= While many variations exist the most common depiction of the Windows 98 operating systems is a pair of young girls. The OS-tan representative of the original release of Windows 98 is shown in a white and blue uniform that includes the Windows logo as part of a neck tie, navy blue hair, and a \\"98\\" hair clip. The Windows 98 Second Edition OS-tan is similar in appearance, but wears a green sailor school uniform with the letters \\"SE\\" on the front. Two early representations that are also seen are a pair of stick-limbed Pocky boxes with a face and version number drawn in crayon. This is a reference to Vulcan 300, a character from the Zatch Bell! anime series. These early representations are still used as a mecha piloted by the girls, dolls carried by the girls, or sometimes even as hiding places for them. =Windows 95= As Windows 95 is considered to be the oldest of the modern 32-bit Windows operating systems, it is usually represented as a traditional lady from the early modern era of Japan. She is typically depicted as a gentle-looking brown haired woman in a kimono, with a hair ribbon showing the four Windows colors. Her outfit is a traditional kimono and a hakama of Japan and she wears thick sandals, or geta, on her feet. These were a woman college student's typical clothes as seen in the earliest period during the course of the modernization in Japan (from the Meiji period to the Taish≈ç period) and is a reference to the modernization of Windows in comparison to the modernization of Japan. Additionally, the pattern of her kimono is based on the file \\"hana256.bmp\\", which was used as a desktop wallpaper pattern in the Japanese version of Windows. She is typically depicted as engaged in drinking tea, serving meals or doing other housework. One recurring theme in stories is her unfamiliarity with newer, post Win-95 technologies, such as USB devices (even though the OSR 2.x supported it) and broadband internet connections. She is also occasionally depicted wielding a katana in an aggressive manner, symbolizing that it was with her generation of operating systems that Microsoft finally achieved full dominance of the personal computer market. =Windows 3.1= Windows 3.1 is a short girl with long silver hair, a long light purple dress, and a large purple bow on her head. She is often seen carrying a small, black cat on her head as well. She acts as a servant, or a maid of some sort, who serves and tends to DOS-tan. This is a reference to the fact that Windows 3.1 is not a full operating system, but rather just a GUI for MS-DOS. =Mac OS X= Mac OS X Leopard-tan The Mac OS X girl is often portrayed as a catgirl, following with the Apple \\"wild cat\\" naming tradition (every Mac OS X release until OS X Mavericks had a codename like Jaguar, Panther, Tiger, Snow Leopard, etc.). Otherwise, she is shown as an older variation of the Mac OS 9 girl, wearing a white coat and wearing an AirPort wireless hub fashioned as a hat. She is occasionally shown holding a publication of some sort, as Macs are often used for desktop publishing. =Linux= Linux-tan Originally seen as a bearded penguin (a reference to Tux, the penguin mascot of the Linux kernel), an image of a girl with a helmet and flippers was chosen as a human alternative. Her helmet (most likely a metaphor for the Linux kernel's oft-claimed excellent security) usually has horns on it, likely a reference to the GNU software which comprises the common system programs present in nearly all Linux distributions. The gear teeth on the helmet are a reference to KDE, a common desktop environment used with GNU/Linux. The foot symbol on her shirt is a reference to GNOME, another common desktop environment. She is often seen with a spear that has flags attached representing the GRUB, LILO and GCC tools for Linux. =MSX-DOS= The MSX-DOS girl is often portrayed as a young but grey- haired girl carrying a large cartridge-shaped bag with an MSX-DOS logo on it. There is even a short game featuring this OS-tan as player character. The bag this OS-tan is often shown holding is cartridge-shaped, likely because MSXDOS2 required an cartridge with an extra 64 KB of ROM in order to work. =American -tan= Some Americanized versions of Windows related OS-tan, named XP-USA, Me-USA, and 2K-USA, were published in the Ohzora's FanBook in a comic strip named \\"Trouble Windows in USA\\", by Saint Muscle. =Supporting characters= Opera Because of heavy associations between operating systems and their supporting programs, such as anti-virus clients and Web browsers, many supporting characters have been created to personify the idiosyncrasies of these applications. Some examples are: * Amazon Kindle: Kindle-kun * Chromium: Chrome-tan * DOS: DOS-tan * Internet Explorer/Microsoft Edge: Inori Aizawa (IE-tan) * McAfee: Miss McAfee * Mozilla Firefox: Firefox-tan; Foxkeh'' * Norton Utilities: Dr. Norton * Opera: Opera-tan * Silverlight: Hikaru Aizawa * Microsoft Azure: Claudia Madobe Critical reception Wired News rated OS-tan among the \\"Lamest Technology Mascots Ever\\", yet \\"strangely compelling\\".

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 15, 1990.\\"The Crepes of Wrath\\" The Simpsons.com. Retrieved on August 29, 2008 It was written by George Meyer, Sam Simon, John Swartzwelder and Jon Vitti, and directed by Wes Archer and Milton Gray.The Crepes of Wrath BBC.co.uk. Retrieved on August 29, 2008 Bart is sent to France on a student exchange trip, where his hosts treat him like a slave. Meanwhile, an Albanian student takes Bart's place in the Simpson family, and shows great interest in Homer's work at the nuclear power plant. The episode received generally positive reviews from critics. In 1997, David Bauder from TV Guide named it the greatest episode of The Simpsons, and the 17th-greatest episode of any television series. Plot After Homer trips over Bart's skateboard and falls down the stairs, he is confined to the couch for several days with an injured back. As punishment, Marge makes Bart clean his room, where he discovers an old cherry bomb. At school the next day, he flushes it down a toilet in the boys' restroom while Principal Skinner's mother, Agnes, is using the adjacent girls' restroom. The resulting explosion blows her off the toilet seat and enrages Principal Skinner. Skinner proposes to Homer and Marge that Bart be deported by enrolling him in the school foreign exchange program. When Bart sees a picture of a lovely French ch√¢teau, he agrees to go there, much to Homer and Skinner's delight. The Simpsons host a student from Albania named Adil Hoxha. When Bart arrives at Ch√¢teau Maison, he finds a dilapidated farmhouse at a run-down vineyard. His hosts are two unscrupulous, abusive winemakers, C√©sar and his nephew Ugolin, who treat him like a slave. Bart is starved while being made to carry buckets of water, pick and crush grapes, sleep on the floor, and test wine contaminated with antifreeze. Adil arrives in Springfield and impresses Marge and Homer with his polite manners and help with household chores. They are unaware that Adil is actually an Albanian spy sent to obtain blueprints of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant's reactor. Homer unwittingly takes him on a tour of the plant and thinks nothing when Adil takes many photographs, which he transmits to Albania with a fax machine hidden in Bart's tree house. When Bart's captors send him to town to buy a case of antifreeze, he asks a gendarme for help, but the man does not speak a word of English. Bart walks away, knocking himself for his inability to pick up the native language, when he suddenly begins speaking French. Realizing That he is now fluent, he tells the gendarme about the cruelty that he has suffered at the hands of the winemakers, and about their efforts to sell adulterated wine (with this crime being treated worse by the gendarme than Bart's actual exploitation). The men are swiftly arrested and Bart is hailed as a hero for exposing their scheme to sell adulterated wine. In Springfield, Adil is caught spying by the FBI and deported to Albania in exchange for the return of an American spy captured there. Bart returns home with gifts for his family. Homer has difficulty opening a wine bottle but is pleased to hear Bart speak French, unaware that Bart has called him a buffoon. Production \\"The Crepes of Wrath\\" was the first episode of The Simpsons for which George Meyer was credited as a writer, and he wrote it together with Sam Simon, John Swartzwelder and Jon Vitti. The episode was inspired by the French movie Manon of the Spring. The writers were trying to figure out which country the foreign exchange student should come from when they decided on Albania. They had not seen many uses of the country on television and decided to make the episode a tribute to actor John Belushi, who has Albanian roots. The writers did not know much about the country and could not think of a good name for the boy, so they gave him the surname Hoxha after the former leader of Albania, Enver Hoxha. They used real Albanian in the scene where Adil says goodbye to his family, and they tried to get the actual language right at Sam Simon's instigation. They also used real French in the scenes of Bart in France. The writers did some research on a certain airport in France for the shots of Bart at the airport in Paris. Principal Skinner's mother, Agnes Skinner, made her first appearance on The Simpsons in this episode, although her voice was a bit different from what the viewers became used to in the later episodes of the show. √âdouard Manet's painting D√©jeuner sur l'herbe is referenced in the episode. C√©sar and Ugolin are named after the peasants from the 1986 French language films Jean de Florette and Manon des Sources. Bart's French gift to Maggie is a reference to Le Ballon Rouge, a short French children's film. On the way to the chateau, Bart and Ugolin cycle past scenes depicted in several famous paintings, notably Bassin aux nymph√©as by Claude Monet, Champ de bl√© aux corbeaux by Vincent van Gogh, Le r√™ve by Henri Rousseau and D√©jeuner sur l'herbe by √âdouard Manet. It has been acknowledged that a similar scandal involving the use of anti-freeze in wine emerged from Austria and West Germany during the 1985 diethylene glycol wine scandalhttps://www.simpsonsarchive.com/episodes/7G13.htmlhttp://nowiknow.com/wine- and-antifreeze/ Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"The Crepes of Wrath\\" finished 29th for the week with a Nielsen rating of 15.9, the second highest rated show on Fox. \\"The Crepes of Wrath\\" received generally positive reviews from critics. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, said the episode was a \\"Tour de Force\\" and that this was \\"perhaps the first episode to make the viewer's jaw drop at the audacity and invention of the series' makers\\". In a DVD review of the first season, David B. Grelck rated this episode a (of 5), adding: \\"while the laughs are a bit dry in this episode, the over-the-top plot is indicative of zaniness to come\\". Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review that \\"it's clear that the writers had started to find their groove by the time this episode was produced. From start to finish, 'Crepes' offered a solid experience, as the show began to feature more style and subtlety.\\" Scott Collura at Hollywood Video praised the episode in a review, saying \\"it is one of the best of the first season.\\" In 1997, David Bauder from TV Guide named this episode the greatest episode of The Simpsons, and the 17th greatest episode of any television show of all time.TV Guide 100 Greatest TV Episodes The Augusta Chronicle.

Broader, it can also be found in other parts of Scandinavia. Etymology The word Karsk is derived from the Old Norse adjective karskr, meaning healthy, vigorous or agile. Origin The precise origin of Karsk is unknown, however it appears to have been a popular drink in the Swedish Bohusl√§n district in the early 1800s. By the latter half of the century, its popularity spread across Norway. It was and still is especially popular in rural areas, although city-folk also enjoy it. It is firmly embedded as a part of the culture in Tr√∏ndelag, and according to former Norwegian Minister of Culture Trond Giske \\"Everyone who has grown up in Tr√∏ndelag, has had Karsk at some point\\". Variations In English-speaking countries, the variant with vodka instead of moonshine is sometimes called Russian coffee, though Russian coffee can also refer to a variant served with whipped cream. In Norway, the term karsk is predominantly used in the mid- region of the country (Tr√∏ndelag, roughly corresponding to the county of Tr√∏ndelag), while it may be referred to with other terms in other parts of the country. For instance, it may also be referred to as kaffedoktor (\\"Coffee doctor\\") or knikt (Hedmark dialect for knekt (jack/knave)); both these are for instance popular designations in the counties of Hedmark and Oppland. In Northern Norway it may also be referred to as rotar, though some would use these terms (kaffedoktor and rotar) exclusively about a variety where sugar is added with the coffee. In Sweden it is called kask, kaffekask (\\"strong coffee\\") or kaffeg√∂k and is mainly drunk in the central and northern parts. Even the Southeastern dialect of Finnish has an expression for the beverage, there called kaffepl√∂r√∂ or kaffebl√∂r√∂. In Denmark this type of drink is usually called a kaffepunch and traditionally consists of nothing but coffee with schnapps. Preparation The mixing ratio varies according to the strength of spirit that has been selected and the personal preferences of taste. If you use the \\"96%\\" moonshine, one usually tends to be more generous on the coffee than on booze. With normal 60% \\"polsprit\\" (legally bought spirits from Vinmonopolet) it is custom to mix up to half and half. A traditional \\"recipe\\" is to put a coin in the bottom of the cup, pour the coffee until it is no longer visible, and mixing with alcohol until it reappears. The recipe is often claimed to be a hoax, as the coin will not reappear in a cylindrical coffee cup. This phenomenon is explained by the Beer‚ÄìLambert law stating that the absorption of light is proportional to the concentration. As such in order for the recipe to work one will need a cup with a significantly wider top than bottom which will allow for the concentration to decrease faster than the column of liquid increases. Coffee used in karsk is often weaker than regular coffee, and at rural celebrations in the Tr√∏ndelag region, it has been customary to serve half cups with \\"thin coffee\\", since it is expected that most people carry a flask of moonshine with them, to add to the cup. If the Karsk becomes too strong, it is possible to decrease the alcohol content, inflame the surface of the alcohol-fume with a lighter or match. The hotter the coffee, the easier the alcohol will burn. Cold karsk will not ignite until the concentration exceeds 60-70%. The Karsk will also taste subjectively stronger the hotter it is. It is recommended to taste towards a desired concentration by increasing the amount of ethanol gradually, since the burning alcohol will be lost.

It is a title often used interchangeably with the title of lawyer. The word counsel can also mean advice given outside of the context of the legal profession. UK and Ireland The legal system in England uses the term counsel as an approximate synonym for a barrister-at-law, but not for a solicitor, and may apply it to mean either a single person who pleads a cause, or collectively, the body of barristers engaged in a case. The difference between \\"Barrister\\" and \\"Counsel\\" is subtle. \\"Barrister\\" is a professional title awarded by one of the four Inns of Court, and is used in a barrister's private, academic or professional capacity. \\"Counsel\\" is used to refer to a barrister who is instructed on a particular case. It is customary to use the third person when addressing a barrister instructed on a case: \\"Counsel is asked to advise\\" rather than \\"You are asked to advise\\". The legal term counsellor, or more fully, counsellor-at- law, became practically obsolete in England, but continued in use locally in Ireland, as an equivalent to barrister, where a Senior Counsel (S.C.) is equivalent to the English Queen's Counsel (Q.C.) After they have graduated from University with a law degree, they become a 'junior counsel', their work normally is completing most of the paperwork in cases (such as drafting legal documents). After about 10 to 15 years of practising as a junior counsel, a barrister may apply to become a senior counsel. This is sometimes called \\"taking silk\\" this because the senior counsel's gown was traditionally made of silk. A senior counsel may have the letters SC after his/her name. North America In the United States of America, the term counselor-at-law designates, specifically, an attorney admitted to practice in all courts of law; but as the United States legal system makes no formal division of the legal profession into two classes, as in the United Kingdom, most US citizens use the term loosely in the same sense as lawyer, meaning one who is versed in (or practicing) law. In the United States and Canada, many large and midsize law firms have lawyers with the job title of \\"counsel\\", \\"special counsel\\" or \\"of counsel\\". These lawyers are employees of the firm like associates, although some firms have an independent contractor relationship with them. But unlike associates, and more like partners, they generally have their own clients, manage their own files, and may supervise associates. Non-legal usage The word \\"counsel\\" also means advice given by a professional (psychology and social sciences, religious, academic, etc.) regarding the judgment or conduct of another.

The Venerable is used as a style or epithet in several Christian churches. It is also the common English-language translation of a number of Buddhist titles, and is used as a word of praise in some cases. Christianity =Catholic= In the Catholic Church, after a deceased Catholic has been declared a Servant of God by a bishop and proposed for beatification by the Pope, such a servant of God may next be declared venerable (\\"heroic in virtue\\") during the investigation and process leading to possible canonization as a saint. A declaration that a person is venerable, however, is not a pronouncement of their definitely being in Heaven. The pronouncement means it is considered likely that they are in heaven, but it is possible the person could still be undergoing purgation (\\"purgatory\\"). Before a person is considered to be venerable, that person must be declared as such by a proclamation, approved by the Pope, of having lived a life that was \\"heroic in virtue\\", the virtues being the theological virtues of faith, hope, and charity and the cardinal virtues of prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance. The next steps are beatification, which normally requires a miracle by the intercession of the candidate, from which point the person is referred to as The Blessed. The blessed declaration very strongly implies the person is in heaven experiencing the beatific vision, but it is not actually infallible. Finally, the canonization process is consummated when the person intercedes in a miracle (normally, this is their second intercession) and the person is declared a saint. Exceptions to this pathway of canonization do exist. The declaration of sainthood is definitive (infallible) only to the extent that the Catholic Church claims the person died in the state of grace and already enjoys beatific vision. For example, Popes Pius XII and John Paul II were both declared venerable by Pope Benedict XVI in December 2009, and John Paul II was declared a saint in 2014. Other examples of Venerables are Bishop Fulton J. Sheen, Princess Louise of France, Francis Libermann, and Mother Mary Potter. The 7th/8th century English monk St Bede was referred to as venerable soon after his death and is still very often called \\"the Venerable Bede\\" despite having been canonized in 1899. This is also the honorific used for hermits of the Carthusian Order, in place of the usual term of \\"Reverend\\". =Anglican= In the Anglican Communion, \\"The Venerable\\" (abbreviated as \\"the Ven.\\") is the style usually given to an archdeacon.\\"List of Abbreviations\\", Crockford's Clerical Directory website. =Eastern Orthodoxy= In the Orthodox Church the term \\"Venerable\\" is commonly used as the English-language translation of the title given to monastic saints (Greek: Hosios, Church Slavonic: Prepodobni; both Greek and Church Slavonic forms are masculinum). A monastic saint who was martyred for the Orthodox faith is referred to as \\"Venerable Martyr\\". In the 20th century, some English-language Orthodox sources began to use the term \\"Venerable\\" to refer to a righteous person who was a candidate for glorification (canonization), most famously in the case of Saint John of Shanghai and San Francisco; however, this has not altered the original usage of this term in reference to monastic saints. Buddhism Ven. Galboda Gnanissara Thera. Most Venerable Balangoda Ananda Maitreya Thero. In Buddhism, the Western style of Venerable (also abbreviated as Ven.) is given to ordained Buddhist monks and nuns and also to novices (≈örƒÅma·πáeras).

Background Born at Great Footston in County Meath, he was the son of Richard Blackburne of Great Footstown and nephew of Anthony Blackburne, Deputy Lieutenant and High Sheriff of Meath. His mother, Elizabeth, was the daughter of Francis Hopkins (1724-1778) of Gillstown, Co. Meath and Darvistown, Co. Westmeath, a first cousin of Sir Francis Hopkins M.P., 1st Baronet of Athboy, Co. Meath; they were two of the great-grandsons of Ezekiel Hopkins, Bishop of Derry during the Siege of Derry, by his second wife, Araminta, daughter of John Robartes, 1st Earl of Radnor. Blackburne was educated in Dublin at the school of Rev. William White before entering Trinity College Dublin in 1798, later winning a scholarship, gold medal (1803) and other distinctions. He finally graduated in 1806 (M.A.) and was a member of the Old Historical Society. Judicial career He was called to the Irish Bar in 1805 and practised with great success on the home circuit. Blackburne was nominated a King's Counsel in 1822 and administered the Insurrection Act in Limerick for two years, effectually restoring order in the district. In 1826 he became the King's Third Serjeant-at-law and in 1830 was advanced to the Second Serjeant. A year later, he was appointed Attorney-General for Ireland in the Whig administration of Earl Grey 'though known to be a tory ... with a view to the Irish administration having a broad political base' and on this occasion was sworn of the Privy Council of Ireland. He held the post as Attorney-General until 1834; he was readmitted in 1841 and after serving for a year, became Master of the Rolls in Ireland. As Attorney General he clashed with Daniel O'Connell when he insisted, against O'Connell's wishes, on the appointment of Abraham Brewster as Law Adviser to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (in effect, a deputy to Brewster himself). Blackburne's statement that he \\"would not tolerate a refusal to ratify the appointment\\", is an indication of the influence which could then be wielded by a strong Attorney General. In 1845, he was chosen Chief Justice of the Court of Queen's Bench. Blackburne was appointed Lord Chancellor of Ireland in February 1852, but was replaced in October. After a break of four years, he became a Lord Justice of Appeal. In 1858 'he was invited by Lord Derby again to become lord chancellor, but he declined on account of his advanced age and failing health. He changed his mind, however, and decided to accept Derby's offer but was told that the position had been offered to and accepted by Joseph Napier.' He was bitterly disappointed, referring to the decision as \\"a harsh and cruel blow\\". In 1866, he began a second term as Lord Chancellor, which ended with his death in the next year. Blackburne prosecuted Daniel O'Connell and presided at the trial of William Smith O'Brien. From 1851, he was vice-chancellor of the University of Dublin. A devoted member of the Church of Ireland, he opposed any measure hostile to its interests, arguing that an attack on the Church. was an attack on the Union itself. Family In 1809, he married Jane, daughter of William Martley of Ballyfallen, Co. Meath and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Rothwell of Berford, Co. Meath. They were the parents of three sons and three daughters. Blackburne bought Rathfarnham Castle in 1852, where his family continued to reside for three generations.

The history of Montreal, located in the province of Quebec, Canada, spans about 8,000 years. At the time of European contact, the area was inhabited by the St. Lawrence Iroquoians, a discrete and distinct group of Iroquoian-speaking indigenous people. They spoke Laurentian. Jacques Cartier became the first European to reach the area now known as Montreal in 1535 when he entered the village of Hochelaga on the Island of Montreal while in search of a passage to Asia during the Age of Exploration. Seventy years later, Samuel de Champlain unsuccessfully tried to create a fur trading post but the Mohawk of the Iroquois defended what they had been using as their hunting grounds. A fortress named Ville Marie was built in 1642 as part of a project to create a French colonial empire. Ville Marie became a centre for the fur trade and French expansion into New France until 1760, when it was surrendered to the British army, following the Montreal Campaign. British immigration expanded the city. The city's golden era of fur trading began with the advent of the locally owned North West Company. Montreal officially became a city in 1832. The city's growth was spurred by the opening of the Lachine Canal and Montreal was the capital of the United Province of Canada from 1844 to 1849. Growth continued and by 1860 Montreal was the largest city in British North America and the undisputed economic and cultural centre of Canada. Annexation of neighbouring towns between 1883 and 1918 changed Montreal back to a mostly Francophone city. The Great Depression in Canada brought unemployment to the city, but this waned in the mid-1930s, and skyscrapers began to be built. World War II brought protests against conscription and caused the Conscription Crisis of 1944. Montreal's population surpassed one million in the early 1950s. A new metro system was added, Montreal's harbour was expanded, and the St. Lawrence Seaway was opened during this time. More skyscrapers were built along with museums. Montreal's international status was cemented by Expo 67 and the 1976 Summer Olympics. A major league baseball team, the Expos, played in Montreal from 1969 to 2004 when the team relocated to Washington, DC. Historically, business and finance in Montreal were under the control of Anglophones. With the rise of Quebec nationalism in the 1970s, many institutions relocated their headquarters to Toronto. Pre-contact Map of Hochelaga in 1535. Hochelaga was the first indigenous settlement in Montreal to make contact with Europeans. The area known today as Montreal had been inhabited by indigenous peoples for some 8,000 years, while the oldest known artifact found in Montreal proper is about 4,000 years old. By about 1000 A.D., nomadic Iroquoian and other peoples around the Great Lakes began to adopt the cultivation of maize and more settled lifestyles. Some settled along the fertile St. Lawrence River, where fishing and hunting in nearby forests supported a full diet. By the 14th century, the people had built fortified villages similar to those described by Cartier on his later visit. Historians and anthropologists have had many theories about the people encountered by Cartier, as well as the reasons for their disappearance from the valley about 1580. Since the 1950s, archaeological and linguistic comparative studies have established many facts about the people. They are now called the St. Lawrence Iroquoians and recognized by scholars as distinct from other Iroquoian- language people, such as the Huron or Iroquois of the Haudenosaunee, although sharing some cultural characteristics. Their language has been called Laurentian, a distinct branch of the family. Montreal during the French colonial period The first European to reach the area was Jacques Cartier on October 2, 1535. Cartier visited the villages of Hochelaga (on Montreal Island) and Stadacona (near modern Quebec City), and noted others in the valley which he did not name. He recorded about 200 words of the people's language. Jacques Cartier at Hochelaga. Cartier was the first European to arrive in the area, arriving in 1535. Seventy years after Cartier, explorer Samuel de Champlain travelled to Hochelaga, but the village no longer existed, nor was there sign of any human habitation in the valley. At times historians theorized that the people migrated west to the Great Lakes (or were pushed out by conflict with other tribes, including the Huron), or suffered infectious disease. Since the 1950s, other theories have been proposed. The Mohawk had most to gain by moving up from New York into the Tadoussac area, at the confluence of the Saguenay and St. Lawrence rivers, which was controlled by local Montagnais. Champlain decided to establish a fur trading post at Place Royal on the Island of Montreal, but the Mohawk, based mostly in present-day New York, successfully defended what had by then become their hunting grounds and paths for their war parties. It was not until 1639 that the French created a permanent settlement on the Island of Montreal, started by tax collector J√©r√¥me le Royer de la Dauversi√®re. Under the authority of the Roman Catholic Soci√©t√© Notre-Dame de Montr√©al, missionaries Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve, Jeanne Mance and a few French colonists set up a mission named Ville Marie on May 17, 1642 as part of a project to create a colony dedicated to the Virgin Mary. In 1644, Jeanne Mance founded the H√¥tel-Dieu, the first hospital in North America north of Mexico.Google books accessed December 23, 2007 Depiction of the first church in Fort Ville-Marie in the 1640s. The settlement was established in 1642 under the authority of Soci√©t√© Notre-Dame de Montr√©al. Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve was governor of the colony and on January 4, 1648, he granted Pierre Gadois (who was in his fifties) the first concession of land - some . In 1650, Grou family, the lineage of historian Lionel Groulx, arrived from Rouen, France, and established a land holding known as Coul√©e Grou which is today encompassed by the borough Rivi√®re-des-Prairies‚ÄìPointe- aux-Trembles. In November 1653, another 140 Frenchmen arrived to enlarge the settlement. By 1651, Ville-Marie had been reduced to less than 50 inhabitants by repeated attacks by the Mohawk. Maisonneuve returned to France that year to recruit 100 men to bolster the failing colony. He had already decided that should he fail to recruit these settlers, he would abandon Ville-Marie and move everyone back downriver to Quebec City. (Even 10 years after its founding, the people of Quebec City still thought of Montreal as \\"une folle entreprise\\" - a crazy undertaking.) These recruits arrived on 16 November 1653 and essentially guaranteed the evolution of Ville Marie and of all New France. In 1653 Marguerite Bourgeoys arrived to serve as a teacher. She founded Montreal's first school that year, as well as the Congr√©gation de Notre-Dame, which became mostly a teaching order. In 1663, the Sulpician seminary became the new Seigneur of the island. The first water well was dug in 1658 by settler Jacques Archambault, on the orders of Maisonneuve. war with the Iroquois threatened its survival. Ville Marie would become a centre for the fur trade and the town was fortified in 1725. The French and Iroquois Wars threatened the survival of Ville-Marie until a peace treaty (see the Great Peace of Montreal) was signed at Montreal in 1701. With the Great Peace, Montreal and the surrounding seigneuries (Terrebonne, Lachenaie, Boucherville, Lachine, Longueuil, ...) could develop without the fear of Iroquois raids. Though Quebec was the capital and thus the centre of government activity, Montreal also served a key administrative function in New France. Along with Quebec and Trois-Rivi√®res, Montreal was considered a district of the colony.Yves F. Zoltvany, The Government of New France: Royal, Clerical, or Class Rule? (Scarborough: Prentice-Hall of Canada, 1971), 4. Before the cour de la jurisdiction royale was established in 1693, the seminary of St Sulpice had administered justice.Robert Stanley Weir, The Administration of the Old Regime in Canada (Montreal: L.E. and A.F. Waters, 1897), 68. Montreal also had a local governor who represented the governor general and a commissaire de la marine who acted as the intendant's representative.Zoltvany, 4-5. While most government positions were appointed, Montreal and the other districts did have some element of democracy, if only briefly. Syndics were elected representatives who attended meetings of the council of Quebec and the Sovereign Council. However, the syndics had little authority and could only raise the concerns of their district's residents. This office existed from 1647 until it was eliminated in the 1670s due to government fears over the potential formation of political factions; in lieu of syndics, citizens brought their issues to the commissaire de la marine.Zoltvany 5. Because of their importance to Montreal and New France, merchants were allowed to establish chambers of commerce called bourses and meet regularly to discuss their concerns. A bourse would have collectively chosen a representative to address these issues with the governor and commissaire de la marine.Weir, 86. =Population of Montreal= The Population of the Island of the Montreal during French rule consisted of both native peoples and the French. When the first census was conducted in the colony in 1666, the French population was 659 with an estimated native population of 1000.Louise Dech√™ne, Habitants and Merchants in Seventeenth-Century Montreal, trans, Liana Vardi, (Montreal: McGill-Queen‚Äôs University Press, 1992), 7 According to the sources, this was the only point when the native population was higher than the French population on the Island of Montreal. By 1716, the French population had grown to 4,409 people while the native population was 1,177.Dech√™ne, Habitants and Merchants, 7 The French Population of Montreal began slowly through migration. In 1642 a party of 50 Frenchmen representing the Societe de Notre Dame de Montreal pour la conversion des Sauvages de la Nouvelle France set foot on the island that the Compagnie des Cent Associes donated.Dech√™ne, Habitants and Merchants, 16 The initial settlement had 150 individuals in the first ten years; few remained for long because the site of Montreal was vulnerable to Iroquois attacks. Migration to Montreal increased thereafter; between 1653 and 1659, 200 persons arrived. Eventually approximately 1200 to 1500 migrants settled on the island of Montreal between 1642 and 1714; 75% remained and half of them came before 1670. Migrants came from different regions of France: 65 percent of the migrants were rural; 25 percent of the migrants were from the largest cities of France; 10 percent from smaller urban communities.Dech√™ne, Habitants and Merchants, 46 Development plan for the settlement, 1687‚Äì1723. During this period, Montreal saw a drastic change in its demographic. These migrants came from different groups the largest of which were indentured servants, they were half of the males, excluding those still in service that potentially could go home. By 1681, indentured labour had seen its heyday in both the colony and in Montreal, only religious communities and the richest supported engages who performed agricultural labour.Dech√™ne, Habitants and Merchants, 26 Another prominent group of French migrants was soldiers who accounted for a fifth of all migrants.Dech√™ne, Habitants and Merchants, 25 Soldiers who came in the early part of the colony's history became the notable residents of Ville-Marie, and eventually Montreal.Dech√™ne, Habitants and Merchants, 19 Migrants from a miscellaneous background, who paid their own way to the colony, were an additional fifth of the migrants to Montreal. Women also came to the colony, ¬æ of all women were single, and looking for a husband, these were truly permanent residents since single women and whole families did not intend to return to France.Dech√™ne, Habitants and Merchants, 17 The thirty-one girls who arrived in Montreal with the 1653 and 1659 married within the year, some within weeks of landing.Dech√™ne, Habitants and Merchants, 36 Between 1646 and 1717, 178 French girls were married on the Island of Montreal, 20 percent of the overall permanent settlers. During this period the merchant population was relatively small, a hundred came. This was because Quebec City was the primary place for merchants to migrate to; all the merchants who came to Montreal were related to a resident or another merchant.Dech√™ne, Habitants and Merchants, 44 During the 17th century there were drastic changes in the demographics of Montreal. In 1666, 56 percent of the population were newcomers to Montreal; by 1681, 66% of Montreal was native-born.Dech√™ne, Habitants and Merchants, 47 There was a male to female sex ratio of 163:100 in 1666, by 1681 it was 133:100. Although, the population of Montreal was still dominated by males, the female population grew. The rural proportion represented two-thirds in the first 40 years. However, by 1715-1730 the urban proportion was about 45 percent.Dech√™ne, Habitants and Merchants, 62 Data from 1681 to 1739 show that the point of equilibrium was reached around 1695, with males accounting for 51.6 percent of the population. This percent of the population was maintained until 1710, through migration that was predominantly male. The infant mortality rates in Montreal grew from 9.8% in 1676 to 18.0% to 1706‚Äì1715.Dech√™ne, Habitants and Merchants, 60 Illegitimacy rate for Montreal was 1.87 percent higher than the rest of colony due to the status of the Montreal as a garrison town; some unwed mothers from the countryside would abandon their children in the town.Dech√™ne, Habitants and Merchants, 57 Despite some differences in the pattern of population in comparison to the rest of the colony, Montreal's population developed at approximately the same rhythm as that of the whole colony. In the 18th century, the population grew at an even rate of 2.5 percent per annum until 1725 when the growth rate decreased to 0.7 percent per annum.Dech√™ne, Habitants and Merchants, 61 =Economy of Montreal= Map of the Great Lakes area west of Montreal. Because of rapids west of Montreal, portages were required to travel further inland, making Montreal a key distribution point for trade. In the 17th century, Montreal acted as a point of trans-shipment and a stopover on the passage to the interior.Dech√™ne, Habitants and Merchants, 66 Due to the rapids upriver from Montreal, free sailing through the Saint-Laurence ended in Montreal. Portages inland were then taken. This effectively made Montreal a major distribution centre rather than a mere trading post. Pelts and merchandise were stocked for distribution inland and out. Montreal lacked moorings in the 17th century, forcing trans-Atlantic vessels with larger capacity to unload at Quebec. Goods from Quebec had to be transported by river between the two towns until the construction of a road in 1735. Montreal remained subservient to Quebec due to its isolation. Trade between Montreal and France remained indirect. Not long after its establishment, Montreal provided for its own subsistence.Dech√™ne, Habitants and Merchants, 78 However, the colony was still dependent on France for a range of finished products, iron, and salt. Montreal's principal import, before the end of the 17th century, was finished fabric. The seigneurs of Montreal who owned large flock organized the manufacture and sale of their wool to compensate for the imports. To the contrary, in the early 18th century, for peasants who kept their own sheep and grew flax, production was limited to their own needs. This led to few weavers and a left no more than 5% of textiles sold in Montreal to be manufactured locally. Louise Dechene states: \\"There was no market-oriented production of fabrics and, understandably no import of raw materials.\\" Guns, shot, bullets, and powder represented 15% of imported cargo.Dech√™ne, Habitants and Merchants, 80 The presence of guns meant that colonies retained the services of blacksmiths, or arquebusiers, to repair guns, manufacture bullets, and perform other duties to relieve dependence on imports.Dech√™ne, Habitants and Merchants, 81 4-5% of imports were kettles. The kettle at this time took the form of an \\"easily transportable large copper cauldron\\". Knives, scissors, and awls had to be imported. Local production of these items did not begin until approximately 1660. By 1720, all iron tools could be purchased exclusively from colonial blacksmiths. Small stocks of glassware, porcelain, and china were imported as well. Soon after the founding of the Montreal, when the population numbered 8, the Company of One Hundred Associates gave the city's trading rights up to the colonial merchants. The colonial merchants at Montreal formed the \\"Communaute des Habitants\\". Both Indians and Coureurs de Bois supplied furs.Dech√™ne, Habitants and Merchants, 74 The company remained profitable until the Iroquois Wars, where it slipped into semi-bankruptcy. In 1664, The Communaute des Habitants\\" at Montreal was taken over by the French West India Company. The \\"compagnie de la colonie\\" (as the French West India Company were referred to) had significant scale of operations and capital.Guy Fregault, La Compagnie de la Colonie, 30:(Universite d‚ÄôOttawa: Ottawa, 1960),1 While the Iroquois Wars did limit trade for a time the Natives were still a lot of trade to be had with them. For example, the Island of Montreal did not have a large native population, but 80,000 natives lived within an 800-kilometre radius of Montreal.Dech√™ne, Habitants and Merchants, 4 fur trade in 1662. The fur trade with the natives and the coureur des bois was a vital part of the settlement's early economy. These natives would come to Montreal on occasion to participate in economic activity. One of these occasions happened every August, as Montreal welcomed hundreds of member of various nations to an annual fur fair which dwindled after 1680; as many as 500 to 1000 natives would attend to get better prices than the voyageurs would offer, and the governor would meet them for a ceremony. They would stay outside of town until late September.Dech√™ne, Habitants and Merchants, 10 There were also some natives who lived on the island and in the settlement of Montreal as permanent residents. There were a couple missions founded in Montreal for natives, such as the 1671 La Montagne Mission by the Sulpicians and the Jesuit at Sault- Saint-Louis (Kahnawake).Dech√™ne, Habitants and Merchants, 6 The mission population rose in the 18th century through natural increase and some newcomers; between 1735 and 1752, Kahnawake contained about 1000 people, as did Lac-des-duex-Montagnes. Montreal had some natives residing within the settlement, even if it was temporary, the Jesuits recorded 76 baptisms in 1643 of native children, and this continued to be recorded until 1653.Dech√™ne, Habitants and Merchants, 5 Despite the presence of natives in the settlement of Montreal there seems to be very little intermixing with only seven registered mixed marriages in Montreal, though the number of actually mixed marriages was probably slightly higher.Dech√™ne, Habitants and Merchants, 9 Native slaves were also a reality in Montreal, there were about 50 or so slaves recorded on the island of Montreal in 1716. Therefore, the presence of Natives was definitely necessary for trade, but the Natives were never really integrated into the city of Montreal itself. Very little information exists on how the colony of Montreal obtained foodstuffs before 1663.Dech√™ne, Habitants and Merchants, 188 The town of Montreal was too small to act as an important internal market. Though habitants came to Montreal to sell their goods (such as eggs, chickens, vegetables, and other goods), it was never a regional distribution centre for grain.Dech√™ne, Habitants and Merchants, 192 Furthermore, despite a surplus of unsold wheat at the colony, flour and lard were still regularly imported to feed French troops during the seventeenth century. The ineffective use of the wheat surplus remained a contentious issue for the habitants in Montreal and the royalty in France.Dech√™ne, Habitants and Merchants, 192-193 An intendant explained that: \\"The habitants do not grow hemp because they get nothing for it. Wool is plentiful, but there is no market. They have enough to ensure their subsistence, but since they are all in the same position, the cannot make any money, and this prevents them from meeting other needs and keeps them so poor in winter that we have been told that there are men and women who wander about practically naked.\\"Dech√™ne, Habitants and Merchants, 193 In the eighteenth century, Montreal was central to the illegal trade of furs.Jean Lunn, The Illegal Fur Trade Out of New France 1713-60 (McGill University: Montreal, 1939) 61 The illegal fur trade can be defined as the \\"export of furs to any destination other than France\\".Lunn, Illegal Fur Trade, 66 French merchants carried furs were carried down the Richelieu River to English, Dutch, and the converted Jesuit Iroquois at Albany. The contraband was buried outside the walls of Montreal at the request of merchants in order to avoid more loyal French eyes.Lunn, Illegal Fur Trade, 61 Furs were traded illegally between Quebec and Albany, however these instances were less extensive than the illegal trade between Quebec and France or Boston.Lunn, Illegal Fur Trade, 64 Some estimates place the furs being illegally traded from Montreal to roughly half or two-thirds of total fur-production at the beginning of the 1700s.Lunn, Illegal Fur Trade, 65 Later in the century, records appear to be silent. The presence of English supplies amongst the Iroquois during the period, among other reasons, is given as proof of a continued existence of the illegal fur trade between colonies. =The design of Montreal= The organization and building of towns in New France attempted to continue the history of France and had similar designs to the homes and buildings of France. Originally with the lack of stone and the plentiful number of lumber cites like Montreal were almost completely made with wooden buildings designed in the French style.Morisset, Lucie K., and Luc Noppen. \\"Architectural History: The French Colonial R√©gime.\\" The Canadian Encyclopedia. Historica-Dominion Institute, 2012. Feb. 2013. These buildings completely relied on the use of classic French building techniques and many of the craftsmen refused to use anything other than sawn and squared lumber. This caused the natives such as the Iroquoians to view the building methods of the colonists as odd as almost all of their building was done with unfinished materials such as branches, bark and tree trunks. The buildings in the city of Montreal remained wooden until the year 1664 when Louis XIV declared the colony an officially recognized province. Saint-Sulpice Seminary in 1839. Completed in 1687, the seminary is the oldest standing building in Montreal. This declaration led to the introduction of ‚Äòking‚Äôs engineers‚Äô to New France and to Montreal. This led to actual city layout planning and a shift to stone buildings as well. The government of Montreal helped plan the layout of the city; several aspects of the design of the city in the French colonial period are still present. The Sulpicians, who became the seigneurs of Montreal in 1663, perhaps played the largest role in the early formation of the city.\\"The Old Seminary and Notre-Dame Basilica,\\" Old Montreal, last modified September 2001, http://www.vieux.montreal.qc.ca/tour/etape17/eng/17fena.htm. The Sulpicians helped design Montreal's chequerboard city plan decided upon in 1671 and with the help of the king's engineers the establishment of stone buildings also began.Robert, Jean-Claude. Atlas Historique De Montr√©al. Montr√©al, Qu√©bec: Art Global, 1994. For example, Father Superior of the Sulpicians Dollier de Casson and surveyor B√©nigne Basset originally planned Rue Notre Dame to be the main street of Montreal in 1672.\\"Central Rue Notre- Dame West,\\" Old Montreal, last modified September 2001, http://www.vieux.montreal.qc.ca/tour/etape18/eng/18fena.htm. The designers themselves were all similar to the Father Superior not architects by profession and so the engineers worked closely with the religious order to design and build Montreal. Casson for example also designed the Old Sulpician Seminary, the oldest standing building in Montreal and home to the oldest gardens in North America, in 1684.\\"The Old Seminary and Notre-Dame Basilica.\\" The lack of architects led to the lack of classical metropolitan form common in France and so many buildings had more basic designs. The workers did improve however and as stonemasons became more skilled and stone more available stone buildings became more common. Stonemasons became the men in charge when in came to building as their resource was of the highest demand and what ever could be done without stone was, this had some unfortunate side effects though as fires in Montreal became common. When more stone was used, the issue arose of cracking as the cold and heat expansion stressed the stone this led to the discovery of a basic plan, which worked for the environment and uniformity in buildings. The roofs in Montreal were designed to be of a sharp pitch and they were topped not with slate, which common in France, but were uncommon in Montreal, and they used cedar shingles and the cheaper method of Canadian-style sheet metal roofing. The Ch√¢teau Ramezay, which was built in 1705 as the residence for then-Governor Claude de Ramezay was built with these building styles.\\"Rue Notre-Dame East,\\" Old Montreal, last modified September 2001, http://www.vieux.montreal.qc.ca/tour/etape2/eng/2text5a.htm. Canadian- specific architecture in Montreal began to evolve and form after the fire ordinances in 1721, as wood was removed as much as possible from dwellings and left buildings almost completely stone. This also eliminated the common wooden fashionable extras and designs common in France. This caused only churches truly to have any form of decoration on them and caused many of the colonial buildings to be plain. This lack of artistic expression to demonstrate wealth caused many of the wealthy simply to build larger buildings to demonstrate their greatness. This caused a large boom in the demand for stone and an increase in the size of Montreal.Morisset, Lucie K., and Luc Noppen. \\"Architectural History: The French Colonial R√©gime.\\" The Canadian Encyclopedia. Historica-Dominion Institute, 2012. Web. Feb. 2013. =French military history of Montreal= Depiction of Fort Ville-Marie in 1645. Fort Ville-Marie was the first European fortified settlement established the area. In 1645, a fort was established on the island of Montreal and this was the beginning of Montreal's military history. The fort was key and effective in repelling the raids of the Iroquois and would become a station for soldiers for years to come.Atherton, William H. Montreal, 1535-1914. (Montreal: S.J. Clarke,, 1914), 92 After the arrival of Maisonneuve in the Second Foundation in 1653, Montreal became a front for activity throughout New France and a key launching point for expeditions into the frontier.Atherton, Montreal, 111 Montreal did not become reinforced however until after the establishment of New France as a province and the welcoming of the ‚Äòking‚Äôs engineers‚Äô who came with the military reinforcements. Many of the expeditions who went out to explore Ontario and the Ohio River Valley would start in Montreal, but much of the time in the beginning they would not make it far or they would be forced to return by hostile native forces.Atherton, Montreal, 124 During the early 1700s, many military expeditions left from Montreal to finally deal with the Hostile natives and to strengthen alliances with the Native allies. This led to one of the most significant events to occur in Montreal during this period was the Great Peace of 1701. The conference took place in August and was between the French and representatives of thirty-nine different Aboriginal nations. For the conference an estimated 2000-3000 people (including roughly 1300 native delegates) entered a theatre south of Pointe-√†-Calli√®re to listen to speeches given by French leaders and native chiefs.Gilles Havard, Montreal, 1701: Planting the Tree of Peace (Montreal: Recherches Am√©rindiennes au Qu√©bec, 2001), 42-43. The French engaged in many Aboriginal gestures of peace, including the burying of hatchets, the exchange of wampum belts, and the use of peace pipes.Havard, 44. While the French signed their names using their alphabet, the Aboriginal leaders notably used totem symbols to sign the treaty.Havard, 47 Map of the fortified walls of Montreal in 1752. Walls surrounding the city were erected in 1737 in order to protect it. The Great Peace resulted in an end to the Iroquois Wars and, according to historian Gilles Havard, \\"ostensibly (brought) peace to the vast territory extending from Acadia in the East to the Mississippi in the west, and from James Bay in the north to Missouri in the south\\".Havard, 11 The French had hoped to form a military frontier with their Native allies along the borders on New France against the advancing British colonies. The military thus established many forts along the ‚Äòborders‚Äô down the Ohio Valley into New Orleans.Atherton, Montreal, 315 Many of these such as Detroit relied on Montreal to reinforce them with supplies and military men furthering Montreal's military involvement and development. Due to the importance of Montreal to New France the city walls, a double wall 6.4 metres tall and over three kilometres long was erected in 1737 (after twenty years of construction) to protect the city. Only some of the base of the wall remains today.\\"Champ-de-Mars,\\" Old Montreal, last modified September 2001, http://www.vieux.montreal.qc.ca/tour/etape1/eng/1text2a.htm. This helped make Montreal the most militarily capable town in New France, and so when the seven years war started Montreal was declared the military headquarters for operations in the North American Theatre.Atherton, Montreal, 391 As the military headquarters, the number of military men in Montreal began to increase and the town itself was further expanded and stressed Montreal for supplies. French authorities surrender the city of Montreal to the British in 1760. In 1757 the number of soldiers and natives stationed in Montreal had gotten so great that Pierre de Rigaud de Vaudreuil the Governor of New France realized they needed to take action on a campaign or the army and the town would begin to suffer from starvation. This led to the great campaign of 1757 and with his large force of native allies and the bronzed soldiery of France General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm moved the large force out of Montreal and left a garrison in its place, relieving the pressure on the city to supply the military slightly.Atherton, Montreal, 404 Montcalm was very successful in his military efforts keeping spirits in Montreal high and the people hopeful. After his victory at Carillon, Montcalm returned to Montreal; having just defeated 16,000 British forces Montcalm seemed to be in a good position.Atherton, Montreal,419 This would prove false, because of Montcalm's lack of troops in comparison to the British. Learning of an invasion coming over the Saint Laurence, Montcalm took his forces to reinforce Quebec City.Atherton, Montreal, 428 Montcalm would die there and Quebec City would be lost, which caused a major shock in Montreal as it now seemed they were doomed and though the city was also briefly established as the capital, but with three British armies headed for it, the town would not last long. In September 1760, the French forces finally capitulated to the British and the French colonial rule ended in Montreal. British rule and the American Revolution Ethan Allen marched through the streets of Montreal after his attempt to take the city in 1775. A few months later, the city would be briefly occupied by American rebels. Ville-Marie remained a French settlement until 1760, when Pierre de Rigaud, marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnial surrendered it to the British army under Jeffery Amherst after a two month campaign. With Great Britain's victory in the Seven Years' War, the Treaty of Paris in 1763 marked its end, with the French being forced to cede Canada and all its dependencies to the other nation.\\"His Most Christian Majesty cedes and guaranties to his said Britannick Majesty, in full right, Canada, with all its dependencies, as well as the island of Cape Breton, and all the other islands and coasts in the gulph and river of St. Lawrence, and in general, every thing that depends on the said countries, lands, islands, and coasts, with the sovereignty, property, possession, and all rights acquired by treaty, or otherwise, which the Most Christian King and the Crown of France have had till now over the said countries, lands, islands, places, coasts, and their inhabitants\\" ‚Äì Treaty of Paris, 1763 As a British colony, and with immigration no longer limited to members of the Roman Catholic religion, the city began to grow from British immigration. American Revolutionists under General Richard Montgomery briefly captured the city during the 1775 invasion of Canada but left when it became obvious they could not hold Canada. Often having suffered loss of property and personal attacks during hostilities, thousands of English- speaking Loyalists migrated to Canada from the American colonies during and after the American Revolution. In 1782, John Molson estimated the population of the city at 6,000. The government provided most with land, settling them in what became Upper Canada (Ontario) to the west, as well as Nova Scotia and New Brunswick to the east. The first Protestant church in Montreal was St. Gabriel's, established by a Presbyterian missionary in 1792. With 19th-century immigration, more and more English-speaking merchants and residents continued to arrive in what had by then become known as Montreal. Soon the main language of commerce in the city was English. The golden era of fur trading began in the city with the advent of the locally owned North West Company, the main rival to the primarily British Hudson's Bay Company. The first machine shop in Montreal, owned by one George Platt, was in operation before 1809. The census of 1821 numbered 18,767 residents. The town's population was majority Francophones until around the 1830s. From the 1830s, to about 1865, it was inhabited by a majority of Anglophones, most of recent immigration from the British Isles or other parts of British North America. Fire destroyed one quarter of the town on May 18, 1765. =Scottish contributions= Scottish immigrants constructed Montreal's first bridge across the Saint Lawrence River and founded many of the city's great industries, including Morgan's, the first department store in Canada, incorporated within the Hudson's Bay Company in the 1970s; the Bank of Montreal; Redpath Sugar; and both of Canada's national railroads. The city boomed as railways were built to New England, Toronto, and the west, and factories were established along the Lachine Canal. Many buildings from this time period are concentrated in the area known today as Old Montreal. Noted for their philanthropic work, Scots established and funded numerous Montreal institutions, such as McGill University, the Literary and Historical Society of Quebec, the High School of Montreal, and the Royal Victoria Hospital. The City of Montreal Political protests in 1849 led to the burning of the Parliament Buildings in Montreal. Montreal was incorporated as a city in 1832. The city's growth was spurred by the opening of the Lachine Canal, which permitted ships to pass by the unnavigable Lachine Rapids south of the island. As the capital of the United Province of Canada from 1844 to 1849, Montreal attracted more English-speaking immigrants: Late Loyalists, Irish, Scottish, and English. The population of Montreal grew from 40,000 in 1841 to 57,000 a decade later. Riots led by Tories led to the burning of the Provincial Parliament. Rather than rebuild, the government chose Toronto as the new capital of the colony. In Montreal the Anglophone community continued to build McGill, one of Canada's first universities, and the wealthy continued to build large mansions at the foot of Mount Royal as the suburbs expanded. Long before the Royal Military College of Canada was established in 1876, there were proposals for military colleges in Canada. Staffed by British Regulars, adult male students underwent a 3-month-long military course in Montreal in 1865 at the School of Military Instruction in Montreal. Established by Militia General Order in 1865, the school enabled Officers of Militia or Candidates for Commission or promotion in the Militia to learn Military duties, drill and discipline, to command a Company at Battalion Drill, to Drill a Company at Company Drill, the internal economy of a Company and the duties of a Company's Officer. The school was retained at Confederation, in 1867. In 1868, The School of Artillery was formed in Montreal.Richard Preston 'Canada's RMC: A History of the Royal Military College of Canada' published by the RMC Club by U of Toronto Press. =American Civil War= Montr√©al's status as a major inland port with direct connections to Britain and France made it a valuable asset for both sides of the American Civil War. While Confederate troops secured arms and supplies from the friendly British, Union soldiers and agents spied on their activity while similarly arranging for weapons shipments from France. John Wilkes Booth spent some time in Montr√©al prior to assassinating President Lincoln, and in one case was said to have drunkenly gallivanted throughout the city telling anyone who would listen of his plan to kill Lincoln. Almost all took him to be a fool. After the War, President of the Confederacy Jefferson Davis stayed at a manor house located at the current site of The Bay on Sainte-Catherine's Street West; a plaque commemorating the site was installed on the West wall of the building, on Union Avenue, in 1957 by the United Daughters of the Confederacy. The plaque was removed in 2017. =Industrialization= View of Lachine Canal in 1852. Bypassing the rapids west of the city, the canal linked Montreal with other continental markets, spurring its industrialization. The Lachine Canal and major new businesses linked the established port of Montreal with continental markets and led to rapid industrialization during the mid-19th century. The economic boom attracted French Canadian labourers from the surrounding countryside to factories in satellite cities such as Saint- Henri and Maisonneuve. Irish immigrants settled in tough working-class neighbourhoods such as Pointe-Saint-Charles and Griffintown, making English and French linguistic groups roughly equal in size. The growing city also attracted immigrants from Italy, and Eastern Europe. In 1852, Montreal had 58,000 inhabitants and by 1860, Montreal was the largest city in British North America, and it was the undisputed economic and cultural centre of Canada. From 1861 to the Great Depression of 1930, Montreal developed in what some historians call its Golden Age. Saint Jacques Street became the most important economic centre of the Dominion of Canada. The Canadian Pacific Railway made its headquarters there in 1880, and the Canadian National Railway in 1919. At the time of its construction in 1928, the new head office of the Royal Bank of Canada at 360 St. James Street was the tallest building in the British Empire. With the annexation of neighbouring towns between 1883 and 1918, Montreal became a mostly Francophone city again. The tradition of alternating between a francophone and an anglophone mayor began, lasting until 1914. Montreal shared control of the Canadian securities market with Toronto from the 1850s to the 1970s causing a persistent rivalry between the two. The financiers were Anglophones. However both cities were overshadowed by London and later New York, for they had easy access to these much larger financial centres.Ranald C. Michie, \\"The Canadian Securities Market, 1850‚Äì1914,\\" Business History Review (1988), 62#1 pp 35‚Äì73. 39p 1914‚Äì1939  An anti-conscription rally in Montreal, 1917. French-Canadian opposition towards conscription in the latter years of World War I led to the Conscription Crisis of 1917. Montrealers volunteered to serve in the army in the early days of World War I, but most French Montrealers opposed mandatory conscription and enlistment fell off. After the war, the Prohibition movement in the United States turned Montreal into a destination for Americans looking for alcohol. Americans went to Montreal for its drinking, gambling, and prostitution, unrivalled in North America at this time, which earned the city the nickname \\"Sin City\\". Montreal had a population of 618,000 in 1921, growing to 903,000 in 1941. The twenties saw many changes in the city and the introduction of new technologies continued to have a prominent impact. The introduction of the car in large numbers began to transform the nature of the city. The world's first commercial radio station, XWA began broadcasting in 1920. A huge mooring mast for dirigibles was constructed in St. Hubert in anticipation of trans-Atlantic lighter-than-air passenger service, but only one craft, the R-100, visited in 1930 and the service never developed. However, Montreal became the eastern hub of the Trans-Canada Airway in 1939. Film production became a part of the city activity. Associated Screen News of Canada in Montreal produced two notable newsreel series, \\"Kinograms\\" in the twenties and \\"Canadian Cameo\\" from 1932 to 1953. The making of documentary films grew tremendously during World War II with the creation of the National Film Board of Canada, in Montreal, in 1939. By 1945 it was one of the major film production studios in the world with a staff of nearly 800 and over 500 films to its credit including the very popular, \\"The World in Action\\" and \\"Canada Carries On\\", series of monthly propaganda films. Other developments in the cultural field included the founding of Universit√© de Montr√©al in 1919 and the Montreal Symphony Orchestra in 1934. The Montreal Forum, built in 1924 became the home ice rink of the fabled Montreal Canadiens hockey team. Dr. Wilder Penfield, with a grant from the US Rockefeller Foundation founded the Montreal Neurological Institute at the Royal Victoria Hospital (Montreal), in 1934 to study and treat epilepsy and other neurological diseases. Research into the design of nuclear weapons was conducted at the Montreal Laboratory of the National Research Council of Canada during World War II. =Great Depression= A Montreal soup kitchen in 1931. Like the rest of Canada, unemployment in Montreal was high during the Great Depression. Unemployment was high during the Great Depression in Canada in the 1930s. Canada began to recover from the Great Depression in the mid-1930s, and real estate developers began to build skyscrapers, changing Montreal's skyline. The Sun Life Building, built in 1931, was for a time the tallest building in the British Commonwealth. During World War II its vaults were used as the hiding place for the gold bullion of the Bank of England and the British Crown Jewels. With so many men unemployed women had to scrimp on spending to meet the reduced family budget. About a fourth of the workforce were women, but most women were housewives. Denyse Baillargeon uses oral histories to discover how Montreal housewives handled shortages of money and resources during the depression years. Often they updated strategies their mothers used when they were growing up in poor families. Cheap foods were used, such as soups, beans and noodles. They purchased the cheapest cuts of meat‚Äîsometimes even horse meat and recycled the Sunday roast into sandwiches and soups. They sewed and patched clothing, traded with their neighbours for outgrown items, and kept the house colder. New furniture and appliances were postponed until better days. These strategies, Baillargeon finds, show that women's domestic labour‚Äîcooking, cleaning, budgeting, shopping, childcare‚Äîwas essential to the economic maintenance of the family and offered room for economies. Most of her informants also worked outside the home, or took boarders, did laundry for trade or cash, and did sewing for neighbours in exchange for something they could offer. Extended families used mutual aid‚Äîextra food, spare rooms, repair-work, cash loans‚Äîto help cousins and in- laws.Denyse Baillargeon, Making Do: Women, Family and Home in Montreal during the Great Depression (Wilfrid Laurier U. Press, 1999) pp 70, 108, 136‚Äì38, 159. Half of the Catholic women defied Church teachings and used contraception to postpone births‚Äîthe number of births nationwide fell from 250,000 in 1930 to about 228,000 and did not recover until 1940. =Second World War= Canada declared war on Germany in September 1939, and the result was an economic boom that ended the last traces of depression. Mayor Camillien Houde protested against conscription. He urged Montrealers to ignore the federal government's registry of all men and women because he believed it would lead to conscription. The federal government at Ottawa, considering Houde's actions treasonable, incarcerated him in a prison camp in Petawawa, Ontario, for over four years, from 1940 until 1944. That year the government instituted conscription in order to expand the armed forces to confront the Axis Powers. (see Conscription Crisis of 1944). The Quiet Revolution and the modernization of Montreal Lighting of the Olympic Torch inside Montreal's Olympic Stadium. The city hosted the 1976 Summer Olympics. By the beginning of the 1960s, a new political movement was rising in Quebec. The newly elected Liberal government of Jean Lesage made reforms that helped francophone Quebecers gain more influence in politics and in the economy, thus changing the city. More francophones began to own businesses as Montreal became the centre of French culture in North America. From 1962 to 1964, four of Montreal's ten tallest buildings were completed: Tour de la Bourse, Place Ville-Marie, the CIBC Building and CIL House. Montreal gained an increased international status due to the World's Fair of 1967, known as Expo 67, for which innovative construction such as Habitat was completed. During the 1960s, mayor Jean Drapeau carried upgraded infrastructure throughout the city, such as the construction of the Montreal Metro, while the provincial government built much of what is today's highway system. Like many other North American cities during these years, Montreal had developed so rapidly that its infrastructure was lagging behind its needs. In 1969, a police strike resulted in 16 hours of unrest, known as the Murray Hill riot.http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/politics/civil- unrest/general-27/montreals-night-of-terror.html Police were motivated to strike because of difficult working conditions caused by disarming separatist- planted bombs and patrolling frequent protests and wanting higher pay. The National Assembly of Quebec passed an emergency law forcing the police back to work. By the time order was restored, 108 people had been arrested. The 1976 Summer Olympics, officially known as the \\"Games of the XXI Olympiad\\", held in Montreal, was the first Olympics in Canada. The Games helped introduce Quebec and Canada to the rest of the world. The entire province of Quebec prepared for the games and associated activities, generating a resurgence of interest in amateur athletics across the province. The spirit of Qu√©bec nationalism helped motivate the organizers; however, the city went $1 billion into debt.Patrick Allen, \\"Les Jeux Olympiques: Icebergs ou Rampes de Lancements?,\\" [The Olympic Games: Icebergs or launching pads?] Action Nationale (1976) 65#5 pp 271-323Paul Charles Howell, The Montreal Olympics: An Insider's View of Organizing a Self-financing Games (Montr√©al: McGill-Queens University Press, 2009) Quebec Independence Movement  At the end of the 1960s, the independence movement in Quebec was in full swing due to a constitutional debate between the Ottawa and Quebec governments. Radical groups formed, most notably the Front de lib√©ration du Qu√©bec (FLQ). In October 1970, members of the FLQ's \\"Liberation Cell\\" kidnapped and murdered Pierre Laporte, a minister in the National Assembly, and also kidnapped James Cross, a British diplomat, who was later released. The Prime Minister of Canada, Pierre Trudeau, ordered the military occupation of Montreal and invoked the War Measures Act, giving unprecedented peacetime powers to police. The social unrest and related events became known as the October Crisis of 1970. Sovereignty was addressed through the ballot box. The Parti Qu√©b√©cois held two referendums on the question, in 1980 and in 1995. During those decades, about 300,000 English-speaking Quebecers left Quebec. The uncertain political climate caused substantial social and economic impacts, as a significant number of Montrealers, mostly Anglophone, took their businesses and migrated to other provinces. The extent of the transition was greater than the norm for major urban centres. With the passage of Bill 101 in 1977, the government gave primacy to French as the only official language for all levels of government in Quebec, the main language of business and culture, and the exclusive language for public signage and business communication. In the rest of Canada, the government adopted a bilingual policy, producing all government materials in both French and English. The success of the separatist Parti Qu√©b√©cois caused uncertainty over Quebec's economic future, leading to an exodus of corporate headquarters to Toronto and Calgary. In recent years, Quebecois Independence has had a surge of popularity as the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois, the leading Quebecois separatist party, won 7.7% of the vote in the 2019 election which is a 63% increase from the 2015 election. Economic recovery During the 1980s and early 1990s, Montreal experienced a slower rate of economic growth than many other major Canadian cities. By the late 1990s, however, Montreal's economic climate had improved, as new firms and institutions began to fill the traditional business and financial niches. As the city celebrated its 350th anniversary in 1992, construction began on two new skyscrapers: 1000 de La Gaucheti√®re and 1250 Ren√©-L√©vesque. Montreal's improving economic conditions allowed further enhancements of the city infrastructure, with the expansion of the metro system, construction of new skyscrapers, and the development of new highways, including the start of a ring road around the island. The city attracted several international organisations that moved their secretariats into Montreal's Quartier International: International Air Transport Association (IATA), International Council of Societies of Industrial Design (Icsid), International Council of Graphic Design Associations (Icograda), International Bureau for Children's Rights (IBCR), International Centre for the Prevention of Crime (ICPC) and the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS). With developments such as Centre de Commerce Mondial (World Trade Centre), Quartier International, Square Cartier, and proposed revitalization of the harbourfront, Montreal is regaining its international position as a world- class city. Merger and demerger The municipalities of the Island of Montreal prior to the 2002 merger of all municipalities on the island. The concept of having one municipal government for the island of Montreal was first proposed by Jean Drapeau in the 1960s. The idea was strongly opposed in many suburbs, although Rivi√®re-des-Prairies, Saraguay (Saraguay) and Ville Saint Michel, now the Saint-Michel neighbourhood) were annexed to Montreal between 1963 and 1968. Pointe-aux-Trembles was annexed in 1982. In 2001, the provincial government announced a plan to merge major cities with their suburbs. As of January 1, 2002, the entire Island of Montreal, home to 1.8 million people, as well as the several outlying islands that were also part of the Montreal Urban Community, were merged into a new \\"megacity\\". Some 27 suburbs as well as the former city were folded into several boroughs, named after their former cities or (in the case of parts of the former Montreal) districts. During the 2003 provincial elections, the winning Liberal Party had promised to submit the mergers to referendums. On June 20, 2004, a number of the former cities voted to demerge from Montreal and regain their municipal status, although not with all the powers they once had. The following voted to demerge: Baie-d'Urf√©, Beaconsfield, C√¥te Saint-Luc, Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Dorval, the uninhabited L'√éle-Dorval, Hampstead, Kirkland, Montr√©al-Est, Montreal West, Mount Royal, Pointe-Claire, Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Senneville, and Westmount. The demergers were effective on January 1, 2006. Anjou, LaSalle, L'√éle-Bizard, Pierrefonds, Roxboro, Sainte-Genevi√®ve, and Saint-Laurent had majority votes in favour of demerger, but their turnout of voters was insufficient to meet the requirements for the decision, so those former municipalities remained part of Montreal. No referendum was held in Lachine, Montr√©al-Nord, Outremont, Saint Leonard, or Verdun - nor in any of the boroughs that were part of the former city of Montreal. The Island of Montreal and its municipalities after several communities were reestablished as independent communities in 2006. The Island of Montreal now has 16 municipalities (the city of Montreal proper plus 15 independent municipalities). The post-demerger city of Montreal (divided into 19 boroughs) has a territory of and a population of 1,583,590 inhabitants (based on 2001 census figures). Compared with the pre-merger city of Montreal, this is a net increase of 96.8% in land area, and 52.3% in population. The city of Montreal has nearly as many inhabitants as the former unified city of Montreal (the recreated suburban municipalities are less densely populated than the core city), but population growth is expected to be slower for some time. Analysts note that the overwhelming majority of industrial sites are located in the territory of the post-demerger city of Montreal. The current city of Montreal is about half the size of the post-1998 merger city of Toronto (both in terms of land area and population). The 15 recreated suburban municipalities have fewer government powers than they did before the merger. A joint board covering the entire Island of Montreal, in which the city of Montreal has the upper hand, retains many powers. Despite the demerger referendums held in 2004, controversy continues as some politicians note the cost of demerging. Several studies show that the recreated municipalities will incur substantial financial costs, which will require them to increase taxes (an unanticipated result for the generally wealthier English-speaking municipalities that had voted for demerger). Proponents of the demergers contest the results of such studies. They note that reports from other merged municipalities across the country that show that, contrary to their primary raison d'√™tre, the fiscal and societal costs of mega-municipalities far exceed any projected benefit. Origin of the name During the early 18th century, the name of the island came to be used as the name of the town. Two 1744 maps by Nicolas Bellin identified the island as Isle de Montr√©al and the town as Ville-Marie; but a 1726 map refers to the town as \\"la ville de Montr√©al\\". The name Ville-Marie soon fell into disuse. Today it is used to refer to the Montreal borough that includes downtown. In the modern Mohawk language, Montreal is called Tiohti√†:ke. In Algonquin, it is called Moniang.Geonames See also * History of Quebec * List of historic places in Montreal * List of National Historic Sites of Canada in Montreal * Timeline of Montreal history Notes Further reading =In English = * Atherton, William H.

Owned by Entercom, it is a 50,000 watt Class A clear-channel station with a non- directional signal. The KMOX studios and offices are on Olive Street at Tucker Boulevard in the Park Pacific Building in St. Louis. KMOX refers to itself as \\"NewsRadio 1120 - The Voice of St. Louis.\\" It is considered the first U.S. station to program all talk shows around the clock. KMOX's transmitter is located off Route 162 in Pontoon Beach, Illinois. With a good radio, KMOX's nighttime signal can be heard in most of the Central United States and into Mexico and Canada. Its daytime signal provides at least secondary coverage to most of Eastern Missouri, and much of Southern Illinois. KMOX broadcasts in the HD Radio format. The station is also heard on the KEZK's HD3 subchannel. Along with WSDZ, KMOX is responsible for the activation of the Greater St. Louis Emergency Alert System for hazardous weather, disaster declarations, etc., and is the EAS primary entry point for eastern Missouri and southern Illinois. Programming KMOX airs a talk radio format with blocks of news every morning and in weekday afternoon drive time. Middays it carries the nationally syndicated Rush Limbaugh Show with local talk hosts Charlie Brennan heard in late mornings and Mark Reardon in early afternoons. In the evening, the station airs sports. At night, local host Ryan Wrecker is heard, followed by two syndicated shows, \\"Our American Stories with Lee Habeeb\\" and \\"America in the Morning.\\" On weekend mornings, all-news blocks start the schedule, followed by programs on money, health, car repair, home improvement and old time radio dramas and comedies. Some weekend shows are paid brokered programming. KMOX is the flagship station of the St. Louis Cardinals Baseball team, and was the flagship station for the St. Louis Blues Hockey team through the 2018‚Äì2019 season. KMOX has a large team of local newscasters and reporters, and airs CBS Radio News at the beginning of most hours. KMOX also has an agreement to share news gathering and weather information with KMOV, the CBS Network affiliate for St. Louis. At one time, KMOX and KMOV (formerly KMOX-TV) were sister stations, both owned by CBS. History =Early years= KMOX was started in the early 1920s by a group of businessmen who formed a company known as \\"The Voice of St. Louis, Inc.\\" According to the station's official website, the KMOX call sign was assigned by the Federal Radio Commission (a forerunner of the Federal Communications Commission). The station's owners wanted KVSL, for \\"Voice of St. Louis.\\" The owners also applied for KMO, with MO the abbreviation for Missouri, but those call letters had been in use by another station since 1922, KMO (now KKMO) in Tacoma, Washington. KMOX signed on the air on December 24, 1925. The \\"X\\" was added because the starting date was Christmas Eve, or \\"X\\"mas Eve. A local legend states the call letters mean Kirkwood, Missouri On Xmas. In 1927, the station gave prominent coverage to the Charles Lindbergh flight across the Atlantic, in his plane, The Spirit of St. Louis. That same year, KMOX became one of the first 16 stations in the CBS Radio Network. Radio Digest, September 1927, quoted in: McLeod, Elizabeth (September 20, 2002). CBS‚ÄîIn the Beginning, History of American Broadcasting. Retrieved on 2007-01-01. The other stations were WOR in Newark; WADC in Akron, Ohio; WAIU in Columbus, Ohio; WCAO in Baltimore; WCAU in Philadelphia; WEAN in Providence; WFBL in Syracuse; WGHP in Detroit; WJAS in Pittsburgh; WKRC in Cincinnati; WMAK in Buffalo-Lockport; WMAQ in Chicago; WNAC in Boston; WOWO in Fort Wayne, Indiana; and KOIL in Council Bluffs, Iowa. Two years later, CBS bought KMOX, and began the process of getting approval to build a 50,000-watt transmitter tower. When completed, it gave the now-clear-channel station a signal that could be heard at night through much of the U.S. In the early days of radio, KMOX broadcasts had been picked up in Scotland, New Zealand, the Arctic Circle and South Africa. In 1933, KMOX covered the first post-Prohibition case of Budweiser beer leaving the Anheuser-Busch St. Louis brewery for the White House, a story carried nationally by CBS. Through the \\"Golden Age of Radio,\\" KMOX carried the CBS schedule of dramas, comedies, news, sports, soap operas, game shows and big band broadcasts. The studios and offices were housed in the Merchandise Mart Building on Washington Street.Broadcasting Yearbook 1935 page 40 =TV and FM Stations= CBS had planned to have a corporate-owned and operated television station in St. Louis, to pair with KMOX 1120. In 1957, the network originally won an FCC construction permit to build a new station on Channel 11, the last remaining commercial VHF channel in St. Louis.\\"FCC acts to clear key market V's.\\" Broadcasting ‚Äì Telecasting, January 21, 1957, pp. 35-37. But after being approached with an offer, CBS decided in August of that year to instead buy the existing KWK-TV for $4 million.\\"CBS buys KWK-TV for $4 million.\\" Broadcasting ‚Äì Telecasting, September 30, 1957, pg. 48. KWK-TV was owned by a group including the publisher of the St. Louis Globe-Democrat. CBS took control of Channel 4's operations that March, and changed its call letters to KMOX-TV, sharing the call sign with AM 1120.\\"CBS-TV takes over KWK-TV.\\" Broadcasting ‚Äì Telecasting, March 3, 1958, pg. 10. The original Viacom (not the current one) purchased Channel 4 from CBS in 1986, and because of an FCC law in place then that prohibited TV and radio stations in the same market, but with different ownership from sharing the same callsign, it subsequently amended its call sign to KMOV. KMOX added an FM station on February 12, 1962.Broadcasting Yearbook 1961-1962 page B-98 It broadcast at 103.3 MHz and mostly simulcast the AM station. By the late 1960s, KMOX-FM was separately programmed, airing an easy listening sound, later going to Top 40 as KHTR in 1982 and is currently classic hits KLOU, owned by iHeartMedia, Inc. In July 1968, CBS opened a new studio and office facility in downtown St. Louis to house KMOX-AM-FM-TV, which until that point had been operating from separate locations. The radio stations had been headquartered near Forest Park.\\"D'Arcy's new office reflects spirit of St. Louis.\\" Broadcasting, July 15, 1968, pg. 26. KMOX-TV moved from Cole Street into the new facility, known as One Memorial Drive, and remains there to the present day. =Talk radio pioneer= As network programming shifted from radio to television in the 1950s, KMOX scheduled a full service format of talk shows, news and middle of the road music. In 1955, Robert Hyland Jr. became KMOX's general manager, a role he held for nearly forty years. It was Hyland who leveraged KMOX's relationship with the Cardinals, signing many lucrative advertising contracts with local businesses. Hyland made the decision in 1960 to eliminate the station's afternoon music programming, the last of the non-talk shows. That made KMOX the first full-time talk radio station in the country, helping keep KMOX dominance in the St. Louis radio market for many decades. On February 29, 1960, Jack Buck hosted the first \\"At Your Service\\" program, which included an interview with former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. That program, like the sports and talk shows that soon followed, pioneered a format for radio featuring news maker interviews, guest appearances, and calls from listeners. After Hyland died in 1992, Rod Zimmerman was named general manager. He departed in 1998 to manage CBS station WBBM Radio in Chicago. KMOX picked up Costas Coast to Coast in 1994. Also, in July of that year Bob Costas began hosting a sports call-in show on the station. Karen Carroll was general manager from 1998 until 2003, when Tom Langmyer was promoted to the top position. Langmyer left in 2005 to become vice president/general manager of WGN Radio in Chicago. Dave Ervin managed the station from 2005 to 2008. Becky Domyan, who also oversees sister stations KEZK and KYKY is the station's current Market Manager & Sr. Vice President for Entercom. KMOX started broadcasting in HD Radio in May 2006. For many years, KMOX broadcast using C-QUAM's AM Stereo technology, but stereo transmissions ended in the spring of 2000. On January 30, 2012, Jon Grayson's \\"Overnight America,\\" based at KMOX, and also airing on CBS stations WCCO Minneapolis and KDKA Pittsburgh, became a nationally syndicated program with several dozen stations airing it across the country. The syndication was discontinued in 2017, but the show continues to air late nights on KMOX. =Entercom ownership= On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th. The Entercom acquisition ended KMOX's 88 years of CBS ownership. KMOX held the distinction of holding the record for consecutive number one Arbitron ratings books in the United States. The station was consistently the top rated radio station in St. Louis since the ratings service began in 1972 until 2010, when WARH took over the top spot in the Arbs. KMOX remains the top rated AM station, consistently in the top ten in the Nielsen ratings for St. Louis. KMOX has carried the Rush Limbaugh show weekdays 11am-2pm for several decades. The program is sometimes pre-empted by St. Louis Cardinals' afternoon baseball games. Limbaugh is one of the few non-local shows broadcast on the station. It is syndicated by Premiere Networks, a subsidiary of iHeartMedia. KMOX also carries two non- local shows overnight, \\"Our American Stories with Lee Habeeb\\" and \\"America in the Morning.\\" Habeeb is a programmer with the Salem Radio Network. America in the Morning is supplied by Westwood One, a subsidiary of Cumulus Media. For the past 21 years, KMOX has hosted a holiday radio program, in which KMOX personalities perform an old-time radio show in front of a live audience. =Sports= Buck and Shannon announcing Cardinals game at Busch, 1992 KMOX has had a long history of broadcasting sports. In 1926, it aired the Cardinals-Yankees World Series, and starting the next season the station began airing St. Louis Cardinals' games. During the 1930s and 1940s, KMOX was one of several St. Louis stations broadcasting both the Cardinals and St. Louis Browns baseball games. KMOX lost broadcasting rights in 1948 when a new Cardinals radio network was formed by the team, but by the 1950s, it became the flagship station of that network (in part due to its clear channel status). KMOX's most famous sports broadcaster was Jack Buck, who was the station's year-round sports director during the years he was also calling baseball and football for the CBS radio and television networks. Another famous announcer was Harry Caray, who did play-by-play for Cardinals' baseball from 1945 through 1969. Bob Costas did play-by-play on KMOX for the Spirits of St. Louis of the American Basketball Association from 1974 until the ABA-NBA merger in June 1976. At times, the station's emphasis had shifted away from broadcasting St. Louis professional sports teams. In 2000, the St. Louis Blues hockey team moved to KTRS after having been on KMOX for all but three of the team's 33 seasons (1967‚Äì2000), but the games returned starting in the 2006‚Äì07 season. The St. Louis Blues moved to WXOS starting in the 2019‚Äì2020 season. In 2006, the Cardinals' broadcasts moved to KTRS after 52 seasons on KMOX (1954‚Äì2005) after the team purchased controlling interest in KTRS. On September 1, 2010, the Cardinals announced the return of broadcasts to KMOX, starting in the 2011 baseball season.Cardinals returning to KMOX next season (Sept. 1, 2010) KMOX aired the University of Missouri Tigers Football and basketball games for many years. Starting in the Fall 2011, the Tigers moved their basketball, football, and news & talk programs to 550 KTRS. The station continues to host sports programming such as \\"Sports Open Line,\\" heard Monday through Friday nights, beginning at 6 p.m. Chris Hrabe is the main host. \\"Sports on a Sunday Morning\\" airs from 10 a.m. to noon on Sundays.

He served as Lord Chancellor of Ireland from 1868 to 1874 and again from 1880 to 1881. Background and education O'Hagan was born in Belfast, the son of Edward O'Hagan, a merchant, and his wife Mary Bell, daughter of Captain Thomas Bell. He was educated at Royal Belfast Academical Institution, being in his day the only Catholic in the school. In 1836 hhe was called to the Irish Bar. Career Between 1838 and 1841 O'Hagan was the editor of The Newry Examiner. In 1840 he moved to Dublin, where he appeared for the repeal party in many political trials, becoming an Irish Queen's Counsel in 1849. His advocacy of a continuance of the Union with Great Britain, and his appointment as Solicitor- General for Ireland in 1860 and Attorney-General for Ireland in the following year, lost him the support of the Nationalist party, but he was returned to Parliament as Liberal Member of Parliament for Tralee in 1863. In 1865 he was appointed a judge of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland), and in 1868 became Lord Chancellor of Ireland in William Ewart Gladstone's first administration. O'Hagan was the first Roman Catholic to hold the chancellorship since the reign of James II, an Act of Parliament admitting Roman Catholics to the position having been passed in 1867. In 1870 he was created Baron O'Hagan, of Tullahogue in the County of Tyrone, and held office until the resignation of the ministry in 1874. In 1880 he again became Lord Chancellor on Gladstone's return to office, but resigned in 1881. His tenure as Lord Chancellor saw several major legislative reforms in Ireland, of which the most notable was the First Irish Land Act 1870, providing for compensation for tenants in the event of eviction. His first term as Chancellor was also notable for his continual clashes with the other judge of appeal, Jonathan Christian, a bitter-tongued man with a deep contempt for most of his judicial colleagues, including O'Hagan, who he regarded as lazy and unqualified. Christian even published a letter in The Times attacking O'Hagan and his highly regarded Scottish colleague Lord Blackburn, who had voted to reverse one of his judgments. O'Hagan for his part seems to have regarded Christian as little more than a nuisance, but on taking up office for his second term did not hide his relief that Christian had retired. On his retirement from office Lord O'Hagan was in 1882 appointed a Knight of St Patrick, having become Vice Chancellor of the Royal University of Ireland the previous year. He was president of the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland between 1867 and 1870. Sec Personal life Lord O'Hagan married firstly in 1836 Mary Teeling, daughter of Charles Hamilton Teeling of Belfast. They had a son Charles who died young, and two daughters, Frances and Madeline. Mary died in 1868. Lady O'Hagan, n√©e Alice Mary Towneley, photographed 11 August 1902. He married secondly in 1871 Alice Towneley, daughter and co-heiress of Colonel Charles Towneley of Towneley Park, Burnley, Lancashire, and Lady Caroline Molyneux, daughter of The 2nd Earl of Sefton. They had two sons, Thomas and Maurice, each of whom in turn inherited the title and changed the family name to Towneley-O'Hagan, and two daughters, Kathleen (who lived to be almost 100) and Mary, who married General Sir Charles Monro, 1st Baronet. Alice inherited the family home, Towneley Park, from her father, but found it too expensive to keep up and sold it to Burnley Corporation in 1901. She died on 20 November 1921. Sir Charles Monroe, 1st Baronet, who married Lord O'Hagan's daughter Mary Lord O'Hagan died at Hereford House, London, in February 1885, aged 72, and was buried in Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin. He was succeeded in the barony by his eldest son, Thomas (1878‚Äì1900), and then by another son, Maurice Herbert Towneley (b. 1882). The Liberal Unionist editor of the Belfast Northern Whig, Thomas Macknight, who had been a personal friend of O'Hagan, states in his memoir ULSTER AS IT IS (London, 1896) that he believed O'Hagan would have opposed William Ewart Gladstone's conversion to Irish Home Rule had he not died when he did. O'Hagan's sister Mary (1823‚Äì1876) was Abbess of the Poor Clare convent at Newry and later at Kenmare. Her biography was written by her protege MF Cusack (1839‚Äì1899), \\"the Nun of Kenmare\\".

Other names are either Urartian (Haldita- in the Bƒ´sot≈´n inscription) or obscure and unknown in literate times in Armenia (Araxa- in the Bƒ´sot≈´n inscription).\\" Classification Urartian was an ergative, agglutinative language, which belongs to neither the Afroasiatic nor the Indo- European families but to the Hurro-Urartian family (whose only other known member is Hurrian).The Oxford Encyclopedia of Archaeology in the Near East - Page 292 by Eric M. Meyers, American Schools of Oriental Research It survives in many inscriptions found in the area of the Urartu kingdom, written in the Assyrian cuneiform script. There have been claimsJeffrey J. Klein, Urartian Hieroglyphic Inscriptions from Altintepe, Anatolian Studies, Vol. 24, (1974), 77-94 of a separate autochthonous script of \\"Urartian hieroglyphs\\" but they remain unsubstantiated. Urartian is closely related to Hurrian, a somewhat better documented language attested for an earlier, non-overlapping period, approximately from 2000 BCE to 1200 BCE (written by native speakers until about 1350 BCE). The two languages must have developed quite independently from approximately 2000 BCE onwards.Wilhelm 1982: 5 Although Urartian is not a direct continuation of any of the attested dialects of Hurrian,Academic American Encyclopedia - Page 198 many of its features are best explained as innovative developments with respect to Hurrian as it is known from the preceding millennium. The closeness holds especially true of the so-called Old Hurrian dialect, known above all from Hurro-Hittite bilingual texts. The external connections of the Hurro-Urartian languages are disputed. There exist various proposals for a genetic relationship to other language families (e.g. Northeast Caucasian languages, Indo European languages, or Kartvelian languages), but none of these are generally accepted. Indo-European (namely Armenian and Anatolian, as well as Iranian and possibly Paleo-Balkan) etymologies have been proposed for many Urartian personal and topographic names, such as the names of kings Arame and Argishti, regions such as Diauehi and Uelikulqi, and cities such as Arzashkun, as well as some Urartian vocabulary.Ivanov, Vyacheslav V. \\"Comparative Notes on Hurro-Urartian, Northern Caucasian and Indo-European.\\" UCLA Indo-European Studies 1 (1999): 147-264 http://www.pies.ucla.edu/IESV/1/VVI_Horse.pdfPetrosyan, Armen \\"The Armenian Elements in the Language and Onomastics of Urartu\\" Aramazd Vol V. Issue 1 (2010): 133-140 . Decipherment The German scholar Friedrich Eduard Schulz, who discovered the Urartian inscriptions of the Lake Van region in 1826, made copies of several cuneiform inscriptions at Tushpa, but made no attempt at decipherment. Schulz's drawings, published posthumously only in 1840 in the Journal Asiatique,Schulz, Fr. Ed., \\"M√©moire sur le lac du Van et ses environs, Journal Asiatique ser. 3 vol. 9 (1840): 257-323 + 8 plates. were crucial in forwarding the decipherment of Mesopotamian cuneiform by Edward Hincks.Hincks, Edward. \\"On the Inscriptions at Van.\\" Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society 9 (1847): 387-449. After the decipherment of Assyrian cuneiform in the 1850s, Schulz's drawings became the basis of deciphering the Urartian language. It soon became clear that it was unrelated to any known language, and attempts at decipherment based on known languages of the region failed. The script was finally deciphered in 1882 by A. H. Sayce. The oldest of these inscriptions is from the time of Sarduri I of Urartu, whose title was 'King of the Four Quarters'.John Noonan, Van! at saudiaramcoworld.com Decipherment only made progress after World War I, with the discovery of Urartian-Assyrian bilingual inscriptions at Keli≈°in and Topzaw√§.A. G√∂tze 1930, 1935J. Friedrich 1933 In 1963, a grammar of Urartian was published by G. A. Melikishvili in Russian, appearing in German translation in 1971. In the 1970s, the genetic relation with Hurrian was established by I. M. Diakonoff.  Corpus  stone inscription on display at the Erebuni Museum in Yerevan. The inscription reads: For the God Khaldi, the lord, Argishti, son of Menua, built this temple and this mighty fortress. I proclaimed it Irbuni (Erebuni) for the glory of the countries of Biai (=Urartu) and for holding the Lului (=enemy) countries in awe. By the greatness of God Khaldi, this is Argishti, son of Menua, the mighty king, the king of the countries of Biai, ruler of the city of Tushpa The oldest recorded texts originate from the reign of Sarduri I, from the late 9th century BCE.Urartu - Page 65 by Boris Borisovich Piotrovskiƒ≠ Texts were produced until the fall of the realm of Urartu approximately 200 years later. Approximately two hundred inscriptions written in the Urartian language, which adopted and modified the cuneiform script, have been discovered to date.The international standard Bible encyclopedia - Page 234 by Geoffrey William Bromiley Writing = Cuneiform = Urartian cuneiform is a standardized simplification of Neo-Assyrian cuneiform. Unlike in Assyrian, each sign only expresses a single sound value. The sign gi has the special function of expressing a hiatus, e.g. u-gi-i≈°-ti for Uƒ´≈°di. A variant script with non-overlapping wedges was in use for rock inscriptions. =Hieroglyphs= Urartian was also rarely written in the \\"Anatolian hieroglyphs\\" used for the Luwian language. Evidence for this is restricted to Altƒ±ntepe. There are suggestions that besides the Luwian hieroglyphic inscriptions, Urartu also had a native hieroglyphic script. The inscription corpus is too sparse to substantiate the hypothesis. It remains unclear whether the symbols in question form a coherent writing system, or represent just a multiplicity of uncoordinated expressions of proto-writing or ad-hoc drawings.Paul Zimansky, Urartian Material Culture As State Assemblage: An Anomaly in the Archaeology of Empire. Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research, No. 299/300, The Archaeology of Empire in Ancient Anatolia (Aug. - Nov., 1995), pp. 103-115 What can be identified with a certain confidence are two symbols or \\"hieroglyphs\\" found on vessels, representing certain units of measurement: 100x33px for aqarqi and 100x33px for ·π≠erusi. This is known because some vessels were labelled both in cuneiform and with these symbols.Mirjo Salvini: Geschichte und Kultur der Urart√§er. Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, Darmstadt 1995. Phonology Urartian had at least the following consonants, conventionally transcribed below: Labial stops: p, b Dental stops: t, d, ·π≠ Velar stops: k, g, q Sibilants: s, z, ·π£, ≈° Gutturals: , ·∏´ Sonorants: m, n, l, r There were presumably also the semivowels /w/ and /y/. As usual with ancient languages, the exact nature and pronunciation of the consonants are uncertain. As the table shows, the stops and the sibilants all display a three-way distinction between voiced, voiceless and \\"emphatic\\" consonants, but it cannot be ascertained what was special about the third groups of consonants, which were rendered with the Akkadian cuneiform signs for the Semitic emphatics. Perhaps they were glottalized or aspirated. The pronunciation of the sibilants is debatable, as it is for Akkadian; some may actually have been affricates. The script distinguishes the vowels a, e, i and u. It is unclear whether there was an /o/ as well. There may have been phonemic vowel length, but it is not consistently expressed in the script. Word-finally, the distinction between e and i is not maintained, so many scholars transcribe the graphically vacillating vowel as a schwa: …ô, while some preserve a non-reduced vowel (usually opting for i). The full form of the vowel appears when suffixes are added to the word and the vowel is no longer in the last syllable: Argi≈°t…ô \\"Argi≈°ti\\" - Argi≈°te≈°…ô \\"by Argi≈°ti (ergative case)\\". This vowel reduction also suggests that stress was commonly on the next-to-the-last syllable. In the morphonology, various morpheme combinations trigger syncope: *ar-it-u-m…ô ‚Üí artum…ô, *zaditum…ô ‚Üí zatum…ô, *ebani-ne-l…ô ‚Üí ebanel…ô, *turul(e)y…ô ‚Üí tul(e)y…ô. Morphology =Nominal morphology= The morphemes which may occur in a noun follow a strict order: stem - article - possessive suffix - number and case suffix - suffixes received through Suffixaufnahme. All nouns appear to end in a so-called thematic vowel - most frequently -i or -e, but -a and -u also occur. They may also end in a derivational suffix. Notable derivational suffixes are -·∏´…ô, forming adjectives of belonging (e.g. Abiliane-·∏´…ô \\"of the tribe Abiliani\\", Argi≈°te-·∏´…ô \\"son of Argi≈°ti\\") and -≈°…ô, forming abstract nouns (e.g. alsui-≈°…ô \\"greatness\\", ardi-≈°…ô \\"order\\", arniu-≈°…ô \\"deed\\"). The forms of the so-called \\"article\\" are -n…ô (non- reduced form -ne-) for the singular, -ne-l…ô for the plural in the absolutive case and -na- for the other forms of the plural. They are referred to as \\"anaphoric suffixes\\" and can be compared to definite articles, although their use does not always seem to match that description exactly. They also obligatorily precede agreement suffixes added through Suffixaufnahme: e.g. Argi≈°te-≈°…ô Menua-·∏´i-ne-≈°…ô \\"Argi≈°ti (ergative), son of Menua (ergative)\\". The plural form can also serve as a general plural marker in non-absolutive cases: arniu≈°i-na-n…ô \\"by the deeds\\".Wilhelm, Gernot. 2008. Hurrian. In Woodard, Roger D. (ed.) The Ancient Languages of Asia Minor. P.112 The well-attested possessive suffixes are the ones of the first person singular -uk…ô (in non- reduced form sometimes -uka-) and -i(y…ô) (in non-reduced form sometimes -iya-): e.g. ebani-uka-n…ô \\"from my country\\", ebani-y…ô \\"his country\\". The plural is expressed, above all, through the use of the plural \\"article\\" (-ne- l…ô in the absolutive case, -na- preceding the case suffix in the oblique cases), but some of the case suffixes also differ in form between the singular and the plural. Therefore, separate plural version of the case suffixes are indicated below separately. The nature of the absolutive and ergative cases is as in other ergative languages (more details in the section Syntax below). Absolutive: sing. -√ò, plur. -l…ô Ergative: -≈°(…ô) Genitive: sing. -i, plur. -w…ô Dative: sing. -…ô, plur. -w…ô Directive: sing. -ed…ô, plur. (archaic) -≈°-t…ô Comitative: -ran…ô Ablative-instrumental: -n…ô Ablative: sing. -dan…ô, plur. -≈°-tan…ô Locative: -a Since the \\"complete\\" plural forms also include the plural definite article, they appear as -ne-l…ô, -na-≈°…ô, -na-w…ô, na-(e)d…ô or na-≈°-t…ô, etc.. A phenomenon typical of Urartian is Suffixaufnahme - a process in which dependent modifiers of a noun (including genitive case modifiers) agree with the head noun by absorbing its case suffixes. The copied suffixes must be preceded by the article (also agreeing in number with the head). Examples: ·∏™aldi-i-na-w…ô ≈°e≈°ti-na-w…ô \\"for the gates (dative) of [god] ·∏™aldi (dative)\\", Argi≈°te-≈°…ô Menua-·∏´i-ne-≈°…ô \\"Argi≈°ti (ergative), son of Menua (ergative)\\". The known personal pronouns are those of the first and third person singular. The first person singular has two different forms for the absolutive case: i≈°tid…ô as the absolutive subject of an intransitive verb, and ≈°uk…ô as the absolutive object of a transitive verb. The ergative form is ie≈°…ô. Judging from correspondences with Hurrian, ≈°u- should be the base for the \\"regular\\" case forms. An enclitic dative case suffix for the first person singular is attested as -m…ô. The third person singular has the absolutive form man…ô. As for possessive pronouns, besides the possessive suffixes (1st singular -uka- and 3rd singular -iya) that were adduced above, Urartian also makes use of possessive adjectives formed with the suffix -(u)s…ô: 1st singular ≈°us…ô, 3rd singular mas…ô. The encoding of pronominal ergative and absolutive participants in a verb action is treated in the section on Verbal morphology below. Demonstrative pronouns are i-n…ô (plural base i-, followed by article and case forms) and ina-n…ô (plural base ina-, followed by article and case forms). A relative pronoun is al…ô. =Verbal morphology= The paradigm of the verb is only partially known. As with the noun, the morphemes that a verb may contain come in a certain sequence that can be formalized as a \\"verb chain\\": root - root complements (of unclear meaning) - ergative third person plural suffix - valency markers (intransitive/transitive) - other person suffixes (expressing mostly the absolutive subject/object). It is not clear if and how tense or aspect were signalled. The valency markers are -a- (rarely -i-) for intransitivity and -u- for transitivity: for example nun-a-d…ô \\"I came\\" vs ≈°idi≈°t-u-n…ô \\"he built\\". A verb that is usually transitive can be converted to intransitivity with the suffix -ul- before the intransitive valency marker: a≈°-ul-a-b…ô \\"was occupied\\" (vs a≈°-u-b…ô \\"I put in [a garrison]\\").Wilhelm, Gernot. 2008. Hurrian. In Woodard, Roger D. (ed.) The Ancient Languages of Asia Minor. P.115 The person suffixes express the persons of the absolutive subject/object and the ergative subject. When both of these are present, a single suffix may expresses a unique combination of persons. The ascertained endings are as follows (the ellipsis marks the place of the valency vowel): _Intransitive verbs:_ 1st person singular: -d…ô 3rd person singular: -b…ô 3rd person plural: -l…ô _Transitive verbs:_ 1st person singular (ergative) - 3rd person singular (absolutive): -b…ô 1st person singular (ergative) - 3rd person plural (absolutive): -b…ô / -l…ô 3rd person singular (ergative) - 3rd person singular (absolutive): -n…ô 3rd person singular (ergative) - 3rd person plural (absolutive): -a-l…ô 3rd person plural (ergative) - 3rd person singular (absolutive): -it-‚Ä¶-n…ô 3rd person plural (ergative) - 3rd person plural (absolutive): -it-‚Ä¶-l…ô Examples: u≈°t-a-d…ô \\"I marched forth\\"; nun-a-b…ô \\"he came\\"; a≈°-u-b…ô \\"I put-it in\\"; ≈°idi≈°t-u-n…ô \\"he built-it\\"; ar-u-m…ô \\"he gave [it] to me\\", kuy-it-u-n…ô \\"they dedicated-it\\". As the paradigm shows, the person suffixes added after the valency vowel express mostly the person of absolutive subject/object, both in intransitive and in transitive verbs. However, the picture is complicated by the fact that the absolutive third person singular is expressed by a different suffix depending on whether the ergative subject is in the first or third person. An additional detail is that when the first-person singular dative suffix -m…ô is added, the third-person singular absolutive suffix -n…ô is dropped. It should also be noted that the encoding of the person of the absolutive subject/object is present, even though it is also explicitly mentioned in the sentence: e.g. argi≈°te-≈°…ô in…ô ar…ô ≈°u-n…ô \\"Argi≈°ti established(-it) this granary\\". An exceptional verb is man- \\"to be\\", in that it has a transitive valency vowel, and takes no absolutive suffix for the third person singular: man-u \\"it was\\" vs man-u-l…ô \\"they were\\". The imperative is formed by the addition of the suffix -…ô to the root: e.g. ar-…ô \\"give!\\". The jussive or third person imperative is formed by the addition of the suffix -in in the slot of the valency vowel, whereas the persons are marked in the usual way, following an epenthetic vowel -[i]-:e.g. ar-in-[i]-n…ô \\"may he give it\\", ·∏´a-it-in-n…ô \\"may they take it\\". The modal suffix -l-, added between the valency vowel and the person suffixes, participates in the construction of several modal forms. An optative form, also regularly used in clauses introduced with a≈°…ô \\"when\\", is constructed by -l- followed by -…ô (-i in non- reduced form) - the following absolutive person suffix is optional, and the ergative subject is apparently not signalled at all: e.g. qapqar-u-l-i-n…ô \\"I wanted to besiege-it [the city]\\", urp-u-l-i-n…ô or urp-u-l-…ô \\"he shall slaughter\\". A conditional is expressed by a graphically similar form, which is, however, interpreted by Wilhelm (2008) as -l- followed by -(e)y…ô:Wilhelm, Gernot. 2008. Hurrian. In Woodard, Roger D. (ed.) The Ancient Languages of Asia Minor. P.118 an example of its use is alu-≈°…ô tu-l-(e)y…ô \\"whoever destroys it\\". Finally, a desiderative, which may express the wish of either the speaker or the agent, is expressed by -l- followed by a suffix -an…ô; in addition, the valency marker is replaced by -i-: e.g. ard-i-l-an…ô \\"I want him to give ‚Ä¶\\", ·∏´a-i-l-an…ô \\"it wants to take/conquer ‚Ä¶\\". Negation is expressed by the particle ui, preceding the verb. A prohibitative particle, also preceding the verb, is mi. mi is also the conjunction \\"but\\", whereas e'…ô is \\"and (also)\\", and un…ô is \\"or\\". Participles from intransitive verbs are formed with the suffix -ur…ô, added to the root, and have an active meaning (e.g. u≈°t-u-r…ô \\"who has marched forth\\"). Participles from transitive verbs are formed with the suffix -aur…ô, and have a passive meaning (e.g. ≈°idaur…ô \\"which is built\\"). It is possible that -um…ô is the ending of an infinitive or a verb noun, although that is not entirely clear. Syntax Urartian is an ergative language, meaning that the subject of an intransitive verb and the object of a transitive verb are expressed identically, with the so-called absolutive case, whereas the subject of a transitive verb is expressed with a special ergative case. Examples are: Argi≈°t…ô nun-a-bi \\"Argi≈°ti came\\" vs Argi≈°te-≈°…ô ar…ô ≈°u-n…ô \\"Argi≈°ti established a granary\\". Within the limited number of known forms, no exceptions from the ergative pattern are known. The word order is usually verb-final, and, more specifically, SOV (where S refers to the ergative agent), but the rule is not rigid and components are occasionally re-arranged for expressive purposes. For example, names of gods are often placed first, even though they are in oblique cases: ·∏™aldi-…ô ewri-…ô in…ô E2 Argi≈°te-≈°…ô Menua·∏´ini-≈°…ô ≈°idi≈°t-u-n…ô \\"For ·∏™aldi the lord Argi≈°ti, son of Menua, built this temple.\\" Verbs can be placed sentence-initially in vivid narratives: u≈°t-a-d…ô Mana-id…ô eban…ô at-u-b…ô \\"Forth I marched towards Mana, and I consumed the land.\\" Wilhelm, Gernot. 2008. Hurrian. In Woodard, Roger D. (ed.) The Ancient Languages of Asia Minor. P.120 Nominal modifiers usually follow their heads (erel…ô taray…ô \\"great king\\"), but deictic pronouns such as in…ô precede them, and genitives may either precede or follow them. Urartian generally uses postpositions (e.g. ed(i)-i-n…ô \\"for\\", ed(i)-i-a - both originally case forms of edi \\"person, body\\" - pei \\"under\\", etc..) which govern certain cases (often ablative-instrumental). There is only one attested preposition, par…ô \\"to(wards)\\". Subordinate clauses are introduced by particles such as iu \\"when\\", a≈°…ô \\"when\\", al…ô \\"that which\\".

The campus is situated on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi River and downtown Dubuque. Clarke is known regionally as the \\"College for the Arts\\", and offers a broad undergraduate curriculum in 19 academic departments with over 40 majors and programs. The university also provides graduate master's and doctoral degrees in select areas of study and has a general enrollment of approximately 1,200 students. History Postcard showing the campus before the fire What is now known as Clarke University was established in 1843 as St. Mary's Female Academy by Irish emigrant Mother Mary Frances Clarke, the founder of the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary. It was one of the first such schools for women built west of the Mississippi River. In 1881, St. Mary's moved to its present location atop Dubuque's Seminary Hill (Clarke Drive) and was renamed Mount St. Joseph Academy and College. The college became a liberal arts school in 1901, and the first bachelor's degree was awarded in 1904. In 1910, Mt. St. Joseph was chartered by the state of Iowa, becoming a four-year college by 1913. The North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools accredited Mount St. Joseph in 1918. The academy portion of the school closed in 1928 and the college was renamed Clarke College to honor Mother Mary Frances Clarke and her vision for the college written in 1884 to her community of sisters, almost all of whom were instructors: \\"Let us‚Ä¶keep our schools progressive with the times in which we live‚Ä¶In teaching, we must‚Ä¶endeavor to make [students] think.\\" In 1964, Clarke began a graduate program, with the first master's degrees awarded in 1967. The college was the first small college in the United States to offer a program in Computer Science, also in 1964. Although Clarke College had been an all-female school since its founding, it became a coeducational institution in early 1979. On May 17, 1984, the school experienced a disastrous fire that destroyed four of its main buildings, including the Sacred Heart Chapel. The next day, students hung a large banner reading \\"Clarke Lives!\\" on the campus to show solidarity following the disaster. Soon after, the school launched a major reconstruction project to replace the destroyed buildings. By 1986, a new library, music performance hall, chapel, bookstore, administrative offices, and central atrium were dedicated. The massive, glass-enclosed Wahlert Atrium built following the fire has since become the main symbol of the school. Joanne Burrows, (SC) began her term as president on July 1, 2006, replacing the long-serving Sister Catherine Dunn, BVM. On May 12, 2010, she announced that the college would be renamed Clarke University. She was succeeded by Thom Chesney in 2019. Campus Clarke sits on an intimate campus located atop a prominent hill in Dubuque. The college consists of 16 buildings, an athletic field, and features large, grassy knolls along the south and east sides of campus for areas of study and recreation. The grounds are bounded by West Locust Street on the south, Clarke Crest Court on the north, Clarke Crest Drive on the east, and North Grandview Avenue on the west. Clarke Drive is the \\"main street\\" through the campus, bisecting it into \\"north\\" and \\"south\\" sides. Of Clarke's 16 buildings, 15 are located along Clarke Drive, making it a very walkable campus. =Notable buildings= Wahlert Atrium The Wahlert Atrium is the main building of the campus and is depicted in much of the graphic art associated with the college. It was built in 1986, following the fire which destroyed four main buildings on the south end of the campus. It is made of glass and steel, with inner rooms framed by brick walls. From the Atrium, one can access any of the other buildings on the south side of the campus. The Atrium holds classrooms for art and music, as well as the Jansen Music Hall (recital hall on campus), the library, Sacred Heart Chapel, administrative offices, and the switchboard. Catherine Byrne Hall Catherine Byrne Hall is the main hall of classrooms for the university. Many faculty offices are located in this hall, including a number of those faculty teaching in the fields of mathematics, sciences, and business. In addition to a number of classrooms, there are a number of rooms designated for laboratory teaching in the physics, chemistry, and biology fields. There is a cadaver laboratory in the basement, as well as a planetarium on the top floor. Catherine Byrne Hall is generally regarded as only one of two major halls that is colloquially mentioned by its initials. Eliza Kelly Hall Eliza Kelly Hall is one of the three remaining buildings on the campus that have survived from the origination of the college to the present day. It houses offices of faculty that teach in the music, art, drama and musical theatre, and communication departments. There are also a number of practice rooms for music students to use at their convenience. Colloquially, students refer to the hall as \\"Eliza Kelly\\". In Dubuque, Clarke was known as the \\"College for the Arts\\", although the university announced in December 2018 that Drama and Musical Theater would not longer be offered as a major, and that the BFA was being discontinued. Despite this, the faculty of the Visual and Performing Arts Department remains impressive. The art faculty consists of Eric Wold (graphic design), Louise Kames (printmaking), Jessica Rebik (painting/drawing), and Jessica Teckemeyer (sculpture/ceramics). The faculty of the drama and musical theatre programs include Ellen Gabrielleschi (designer), Nick Halder (director, theatre history and literature), and Joe Klinebriel (director, actor, voice and movement). Mary Benedict Hall Mary Benedict Hall is the female underclass dormitory of the university. A number of upperclass women also live here, at their discretion. It is a five- floor building with a basement that holds a hallway linking it to the rest of the southern side of campus. In addition to student dormitories, there is a recreational center in the basement (known as the \\"Lions Den\\"), and apartments for visitors on the ground floor of the building. Most of the students refer to the building colloquially as \\"Mary Ben.\\" Mary Frances Hall Mary Frances Hall Mary Frances Hall is the co-ed upperclass dormitory of the university. It is reserved for juniors and seniors who maintain a grade point average (GPA) of 2.5 or better. It is one of two buildings in the college where students may possess alcohol, and then only students over 21 may have it legally in their rooms. It is one of the three \\"original\\" buildings still remaining from the origination of the college. It is a four-story building with a central complex extending into western and eastern wings. The first and second floors are reserved for female students, with the third floor reserved for male students. The fourth floor is used for storage, and is generally thought to be haunted. The legend that floats about campus is of a nun hanging herself in her room with the blood oozing onto the floor, which reappears each time the floor has been cleaned. Also, there had been an etching on the window that is sometimes visible from the outside which reads, \\"Help Me\\". When fewer students occupy this building, paranormal activity increases. Mary Frances Hall is colloquially called \\"Mary Fran\\". Mary Josita Hall Mary Josita Hall is the male underclass dormitory of the university. It is four stories tall, with a basement hallway linking it to Mary Benedict Hall. There are also some campus offices in the basement of Mary Josita Hall, including the main security office and the main Residence Life office. The main dining hall is also located in the basement of the building. The first floor is reserved for offices of faculty that teach in the humanities, philosophy, social sciences, political sciences, and history departments. The configuration of the next three stories has varied from year to year based upon enrollment and students electing to live on campus, but generally the majority of residents in Mary Josita Hall are male. Robert & Ruth Kehl Center The Kehl Center is the main athletic and social area of the university. There are two main sections of the center ‚Äì the arena area and surrounding offices, and the \\"Student Activity Center\\" which includes the student union and some student life offices. The arena area of the Kehl Center includes an indoor track, a competition basketball court (with three intramural basketball courts overlapping the main court), two racquetball courts (one filled with cardio equipment), one newly designed weight room, and locker room facilities. In the Student Activity Center, there is a game room, the Whitlow Bookstore, the Crusader Cafe (an alternative to the main dining hall set up in the fashion of a fast-food grill), the Mail Center, and a stage for entertainment. The Kehl Center Arena was constructed in 1997, with the SAC being added on to the main building in 2000. Terence Donaghoe Hall Terence Donaghoe Hall is the main hall for theatre productions at the college. The drama department generally produces four mainstage productions each year (two per semester). It is a proscenium stage design with a main floor and balcony seating. The theater has a capacity of approximately 600 people. Terence Donaghoe Hall is the third \\"original\\" building to have survived to present day.  Athletics  Clarke University teams participate as a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). A name change in 2017 due to negative connotations of \\"Crusaders\\" resulted in the new nickname Clarke Pride; the name refers to the term for a pack of lions. The Pride are a member of the Heart of America Athletic Conference, which they joined in 2016 after the collapse of the Midwest Collegiate Conference. Clarke was also a member of the Northern Illinois-Iowa Conference of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III from 1996 to 2006. Men's sports include football, lacrosse, baseball, basketball, bowling, cross country, golf, soccer, track & field and volleyball; while women's sports include basketball, lacrosse, bowling, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, track & field and volleyball.

If a species has a notochord at any stage of its life cycle, it is, by definition, a chordate. The notochord lies along the anteroposterior (\\"front to back\\") axis, is usually closer to the dorsal than the ventral surface of the animal, and is composed of cells derived from the mesoderm. The most commonly cited functions of the notochord are: as a midline tissue that provides directional signals to surrounding tissue during development, as a site of muscle attachment, and as a vertebral precursor. In Lancelets the notochord persists throughout life as the main structural support of the body. In Tunicates the notochord is present only in the larval stage, being completely absent in the adult animal. In vertebrates the notochord develops into the vertebral column, becoming vertebra and the intervertebral disc the center of which retains a structure similar to the original notochord.  Structure  The notochord is a long, rodlike structure that develops dorsal to the gut and ventral to the neural tube. The notochord is composed primarily of a core of glycoproteins, encased in a sheath of collagen fibers wound into two opposing helices. The glycoproteins are stored in vacuolated, turgid cells. The angle between these fibers determines whether increased pressure in the core will result in shortening and thickening versus lengthening and thinning. Contraction of these muscle fibers result in a side-to-side motion resembling swimming. The stiffened notochord prevents movement through telescoping motion, such as that of an earthworm. Role in signaling & development The notochord plays a key role in signaling and coordinating development. Embryos of modern vertebrates form transient notochord structures during gastrulation. The notochord is found ventral to the neural tube. Notogenesis is the development of the notochord by epiblasts that form the floor of the amnion cavity. The progenitor notochord is derived from cells migrating from the primitive node and pit. The notochord forms during gastrulation and soon after induces the formation of the neural plate (neurulation), synchronizing the development of the neural tube. On the ventral aspect of the neural groove an axial thickening of the endoderm takes place. (In bipedal chordates, e.g. humans, this surface is properly referred to as the anterior surface). This thickening appears as a furrow (the chordal furrow) the margins of which anastomose (come into contact), and so convert it into a solid rod of polygonal-shaped cells (the notochord) which is then separated from the endoderm. In vertebrates, it extends throughout the entire length of the future vertebral column, and reaches as far as the anterior end of the midbrain, where it ends in a hook-like extremity in the region of the future dorsum sellae of the sphenoid bone. Initially, it exists between the neural tube and the endoderm of the yolk-sac; soon, the notochord becomes separated from them by the mesoderm, which grows medially and surrounds it. From the mesoderm surrounding the neural tube and notochord, the skull, vertebral column, and the membranes of the brain and medulla spinalis are developed. A postembryonic vestige of the notochord is found in the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs. Isolated notochordal remnants may escape their lineage-specific destination in the nucleus pulposus and instead attach to the outer surfaces of the vertebral bodies, from which notochordal cells largely regress. = In amphibians and fish = During development of amphibians and fish, the notochord induces development of the hypochord through secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor. The hypochord is a transient structure ventral to the notochord, and is primarily responsible for correct development of the dorsal aorta. = In humans = By the age of 4, all notochord residue is replaced by a population of chondrocyte-like cells of unclear origin. Persistence of notochordal cells within the vertebra may cause a pathologic condition: persistent notochordal canal. If the notochord and the nasopharynx do not separate properly during embryonic development, a depression (Tornwaldt bursa) or Tornwaldt cyst may form. The cells are the likely precursors to a rare cancer called chordoma.  Neurology  Research into the notochord has played a key role in understanding the development of the central nervous system. By transplanting and expressing a second notochord near the dorsal neural tube, 180 degrees opposite of the normal notochord location, one can induce the formation of motor neurons in the dorsal tube. Motor neuron formation generally occurs in the ventral neural tube, while the dorsal tube generally forms sensory cells. The notochord secretes a protein called sonic hedgehog (SHH), a key morphogen regulating organogenesis and having a critical role in signaling the development of motor neurons. The secretion of SHH by the notochord establishes the ventral pole of the dorsal- ventral axis in the developing embryo. Evolution in chordates spotted African lungfish showing the notochord The notochord is the defining feature (synapomorphy) of chordates, and was present throughout life in many of the earliest chordates. Although the stomochord of hemichordates was once thought to be homologous, it is now viewed as a convergence. Pikaia appears to have a proto-notochord, and notochords are present in several basal chordates such as Haikouella, Haikouichthys, and Myllokunmingia, all from the Cambrian. The Ordovician oceans included many diverse species of Agnatha and early Gnathostomata which possessed notochords, either with attached bony elements or without, most notably the conodonts, placoderms, and ostracoderms. Even after the evolution of the vertebral column in chondrichthyes and osteichthyes, these taxa remained common and are well represented in the fossils record. Several species (see list below) have reverted to the primitive state, retaining the notochord into adulthood, though the reasons for this are not well understood. Scenarios for the evolutionary origin of the notochord were comprehensively reviewed by Annona, Holland, and D'Aniello (2015). They point out that, although many of these ideas have not been well supported by advances in molecular phylogenetics and developmental genetics, two of them have actually been revived under the stimulus of modern molecular approaches (the first proposes that the notochord evolved de novo in chordates, and the second derives it from a homologous structure, the axochord, that was present in annelid-like ancestors of the chordates). Deciding between these two scenarios (or possibly another yet to be proposed) should be facilitated by much more thorough studies of gene regulatory networks in a wide spectrum of animals. = Post-embryonic retention = In most vertebrates, the notochord develops into secondary structures. In other chordates, the notochord is retained as an essential anatomical structure. The evolution of the notochord within the phylum Chordata is considered in detail by Holland and Somorjai (2020). < The following organisms retain a post- embryonic notochord: *Acipenseriformes (paddlefish and sturgeon) *Lancelet (Amphioxus) *Tunicate (larval stage only) *Hagfish *Lamprey *Coelacanth *African lungfish *Tadpoles *Ostracoderms (extinct) = Within Amphioxus = The notochord of the lancelet protrudes beyond the anterior end of the neural tube. This projection serves a second purpose in allowing the animal to burrow within the sediment of shallow waters. There, amphioxus is a filter feeder and spends most of its life partially submerged within the sediment.

Bands that have cited Paradise Lost as an influence, or have covered them, include My Dying Bride, Anathema, The Gathering, Amorphis, Cradle of Filth, Katatonia, Moonspell, Lacuna Coil, HIM, Nightwish and many others. As of 2005, Paradise Lost have sold over two million albums worldwide. Their line-up has remained stable for such a long-standing heavy metal band, consisting of singer Nick Holmes, guitarists Greg Mackintosh and Aaron Aedy, and bassist Steve Edmondson. Holmes and Mackintosh are the principal composers, with almost all of the band's songs credited to them. During the years, the band has only changed drummers. History =Early years and Peaceville (1988‚Äì1991)= After their formation in 1988, Paradise Lost released three cassette demos, Paradise Lost, Frozen Illusion, and Plains of Desolation, before being signed to Peaceville Records in 1989. They recorded their debut album, Lost Paradise, at Academy Music Studio in December of that year. The album was released in February 1990.[ Paradise Lost Biography, at allmusic.com] In November 1990, Paradise Lost returned to Academy Music Studio to record their second album, Gothic, which was released in March 1991. The band began to move away from the death/doom sound of their previous releases by adding keyboards and female vocal accompaniments. =Music for Nations (1992‚Äì1998)= Paradise Lost performing live, 1991. Paradise Lost left Peaceville and were signed to the Music for Nations label and released Shades of God in July 1992. The band's musical approach continued to evolve with this album as evidenced by the addition of quieter passages in the song's compositions, the softening of vocalist Nick Holmes's death grunt, and Gregor Mackintosh's incorporation of acoustic guitar to his sound. The album contained the song \\"As I Die\\", later released as a single/EP. In summer 1993, the band recorded their fourth album, Icon, released in September of the same year. The band continued to develop their sound away from their doom roots and more towards the dynamics and sound of \\"As I Die\\" from their previous album. On Icon, Nick Holmes abandoned his death grunt and started using a \\"James Hetfield-style bark.\\" It was after this album, in December 1994, that original member Matthew Archer quit and was replaced by drummer Lee Morris. The band entered the studio in January 1995 to record their fifth and most successful album, Draconian Times, which was released in June 1995. Mackintosh says about Draconian Times, \\"that it's the album by which everything else we do gets judged. Rightly so, as it‚Äôs the backbone of our career and sound.\\" The album charted in the Top 20 album chart in a number of countries including the UK and Germany. Following the success of Draconian Times, and after four years of continuous touring, the band began to get bored with their signature sound and started to experiment with Depeche Mode-esque synth-pop and electronica. This new direction shaped their next album One Second, released in 1997, and was most epitomised by the lead single, Say Just Words. The album was one of the band's most successful releases, particularly in Northern Europe, cracking the German, Swedish, and Finnish top ten charts. =EMI (1999‚Äì2001)= The band moved to EMI Electrola in Germany for its next album, Host, released in 1999, on which they continued to experiment with new sounds, appearing to shed their metal roots. While this album continued to alienate their traditional fanbase in places like the UK, it was their highest charting album in Germany, entering at number 4 on the Album Chart. On the next album, 2001's Believe in Nothing, Paradise Lost continued this synth direction but adding rock elements to the music, forcibly by EMI at the time. Due to the loss of creative control, Mackintosh said that the album \\"doesn't really exist for him.\\" =GUN Records (2002‚Äì2005)= In May 2002, the band signed to GUN Records, and on the album that followed, Symbol of Life, the metallic roots of the band began to resurface; the band decided to work with producer Rhys Fulber to reestablish their metal sound.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wllwAjKfwA The album included guest musicians Devin Townsend, Jamie Muhoberac, and Lee Dorrian. In March 2004, Lee Morris left the band due to \\"personal and musical differences\\" and was replaced by Jeff Singer. Paradise Lost released their tenth, eponymous album in 2005, also on GUN Records. =Century Media (2006‚Äì2016)= Paradise Lost at Kavarna Rock Fest in Bulgaria in 2011 The eleventh album, In Requiem, was released in the spring of 2007 on Century Media; it was generally well- accepted and highly rated by both critics and fans, pleased to see the band returning to their heavier, gothic metal sound similar to that of earlier albums like Draconian Times. The full-length was preceded by a single, \\"The Enemy\\" and on the single, Singer was finally listed as a permanent band member. In a recent video interview, Mackintosh and Holmes revealed that Singer had already auditioned for the band when Archer left, but they chose Morris instead because Singer \\"had a pink drumkit.\\"Prod vid√©o metal et production ind√©pendante In November 2007, Century Media released the DVD Over The Madness, which documents the impact Paradise Lost has had on gothic metal and provides insight into the mindset and workings of Paradise Lost.

It was one of the first commercial full-3D games of its kind. A sequel to Earth 2150, Earth 2160, was published in August 2005. The game also has two stand-alone expansion packs: Earth 2150: The Moon Project, and Earth 2150: Lost Souls. Story It is the 22nd century, after years of war and famine of unfathomable level, the world is returning to normal. 12 states of the previous United States have joined to form the United Civilized States (UCS). While in Asia, a new empire was being created under the Iron Fist of the Khans, these Mongol descendants gave themselves a name meant to conjure up an association with a glorious former age: the Eurasian Dynasty (ED). The UCS now relied upon robots for all their needs, even their military is controlled by machines. GOLAN, the leader of the UCS military forces had recently been altered by order of the current President, leading to a number of glitches throughout the system. One of these caused it to underestimate the Eurasian Dynasty's defensive capacities, causing it to initiate the movement of a large force to occupy the British Isles. This mistake resulted in another violent war, lasting almost a decade. However, GOLAN managed to gain the upper hand against the battle-hardened Khans and so the ED resorted to the usage of advanced atomic weaponry. The ED attacked an encampment of UCS forces at the North Pole with a massive strike involving newly developed and untested atomic weaponry in an attempt to put a decisive end to the hostilities. The catastrophic resulting explosions pushed the Earth out of regular orbit and towards the Sun. Aware that the Earth's orbit has become unstable, a third faction living peacefully on the moon known as the Lunar Corporation (LC) joins the war in an attempt to defeat or reconcile both sides for the common wealth. The objective of the game is to collect enough resources to build an Evacuation Ship, allowing the player's people to journey to Mars and escape the looming apocalypse - foreshadowing Earth 2160. Factions Earth 2150 consists of 3 unique factions. United Civilized States: This faction is a demarchy that controls North and South America. The name implies that the United States of America gradually expanded its borders to include the entire continent. The United Civilized States (UCS) is a highly technologically based faction and have come to use robots to replace people in as many positions as possible. The UCS scientists created, under the supervision of President Jonathan Swamp, NEO and GOLAN; a huge step in technological advances, GOLAN was essentially leader of the UCS military, while NEO was interested in politics. It was a machine capable of matching and potentially far surpassing any organic general. It controlled the entire UCS army including all the military robots. These bipedal robots, or mecha, are just as effective as a human-piloted vehicle. The UCS has a robotic theme to its structures and vehicles. They have exclusive access to powerful weapons such as grenade launchers, shadow generators, and plasma cannons. Other technologies include reverse-engineered anti-gravity propulsion systems from a crashed UFO, and modified 105 and 120mm cannons stolen from the ED. UCS vehicles include Tiger, Panther, Jaguar and Spider Mechs, Gargoyle, Bat and Dragon aircraft. UCS units are typically slow and expensive but durable and pack high firepower. Eurasian Dynasty: Essentially a new Mongol Empire based in Russia, the Eurasian Dynasty (ED) use primitive (by 22nd Century standards) technology such as tanks and helicopters. As such, the ED has the most basic methods of power generation and needlessly complicated resource-gathering. Basic ED units are armed with machine guns, 105 mm cannons, and rocket launchers, while more advanced vehicles can be equipped with laser & ion cannons (developed in response to the UCS' habit of AIs) as well as nuclear missiles. The ED has an industrial, Soviet-reminiscent theme to the design of its structures and vehicles. Some vehicles are the Pamir (reverse-engineered M1A2 Abrams tanks with a one-man crew), Kruszchev and Volga tanks, Ural \\"defense tanks\\" (actually, large, dual- hardpoint tanks), Cossack, Grozny, Thor and Khan helicopters, as well as the most powerful navy. ED units are typically individually weak but cheap and able to be produced in large numbers. Lunar Corporation: The Lunar Corporation (LC) is a matriarchy faction of space colonists who colonized the Moon and cut themselves off from Earth soon after the 3rd World War. Normally a pacifist faction, the matriarchal LC are forced to head to Earth in order to secure minerals to build their Evacuation Ship (due to the Moon's general lack of accessible resources, in real life as well as in the game). The Lunar Corporation is by far the most advanced of the three factions, utilizing solar power as well as antigravity vehicles (explained, in the game, as a result of researching extraterrestrial technologies). Because of this, they do not build trenches or dig tunnels like the UCS and ED. Also, instead of constructing buildings like the other two factions, the Lunar Corporation is able to transport them from orbit to the battlefield. In combat, they use exotic weapons such as electro-cannons and sonic weapons (originally a mining equipment). LC units are typically fast and technologically advanced, but fragile. In the single-player campaign, the forces of the LC are further bolstered by the solitary alien craft known as the Fang, a gift from the UCS in exchange for an alliance. Although losing this one-of-a-kind unit means instant failure, the Fang's weapon is capable of easily decimating any opponent it comes across‚Äîthat is, until its ammo runs out. Reception In the German market, Earth 2150 debuted in 22nd place on Media Control's computer game sales rankings for November 1999. It took 25th and 23rd in the first and second halves of December, respectively, before dropping to 27th in January 2000 and 44th in February. The game's sales in the German region had surpassed 60,000 units by May, a performance that publisher Topware Interactive considered acceptable, according to PC Players Udo Hoffman. However, he noted that the game had been overshadowed by competitors Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun and Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, and remarked, \\"In retrospect, the date of publication was poorly chosen.\\" David Fioretti of the German retailer PC Fun cited the game's numerous bugs and Topware's reputation as a \\"cheap brand\\" as further reasons for its failure to achieve hit status. Earth 2150 was a commercial failure in the United States. CNET Gamecenter's Mark Asher reported in early September 2000 that the game had sold 23,163 units and earned revenues of $873,855 in the country. He felt that this performance \\"can't be classified as a hit\\", and with journalist Tom Chick explained that it \\"didn't even hit PC Data's charts\\".

Such a motion is proposed by a party who is dissatisfied with the end result of a case. Motions may be made at any time after entry of judgment, and in some circumstances years after the case has been closed by the courts. Generally the motion cannot be based on grounds which were previously considered when deciding a motion for new trial or on an appeal of the judgment, thus the motion can only be granted in unusual circumstances, such as when the judgment was procured by fraud which could not have been discovered at the time of the trial, or if the court entering the judgment lacked the jurisdiction to do so. Motions to set aside judgments entered in civil cases in the United States district courts are governed by Rule 60 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The rule is quite straightforward; its court room application is mostly exactly as stated. Motions to set aside judgment in criminal cases are rare: in U.S. jurisprudence the writ of habeas corpus is the usual method of attacking a criminal conviction after the right of appeal has been exhausted.

He attended an Orthodox parochial school, and from 1913 Tbilisi Theological Seminary. In 1918 Peradze graduated near the top of his class, and afterwards studied at the Tbilisi State University until 1921. In the years 1919‚Äì21 he also served in the army. He fought against the Bolsheviks in defense of the Democratic Republic of Georgia.

Grigol Peradze went into exile in Germany in November the same year. However, he would retain the fallen government‚Äôs passport for the rest of his life. Unlike many who left after the Soviet takeover, Peradze had actually secured legal permission to leave the country through the efforts of one of his former professors. Despite this, he was twice refused permission to return to Georgia in 1921 and 1927. Upon the last rejection he wrote ‚Äúdo not know why. I do not belong to political parties. I have not worked against the Soviet government. My goal was always and is the service of our science and culture. Thus, he became effectively a stateless person, traveling on a Nansen Passport.http://www.golubinski.ru/russia/borovoy/–ì—Ä–∏–≥–æ—Ä–∏–π%20(–ü–µ—Ä–∞–¥–∑–µ%20–ì—Ä–∏–≥–æ–ª%20–†–∞–º–∞–Ω–æ–∑–æ–≤–∏—á).htmhttps://www.przewodnik- katolicki.pl/Archiwum/2018/Przewodnik-Katolicki-45-2018/Wiara-i- Kosciol/Gruzinski-Kolbehttps://burusi.wordpress.com/2009/09/12/grigol- pheradze/ After annexation of Georgia, he was threatened with imprisonment, so the Church sent Grigoli to the village of Mankhi in Kakheti as a teacher.http://tbiliselebi.ge/index.php?newsid=268452128 In ordinary times Peradze would have studied in Russia; this route was now closed to him, and other talented students; the Georgian Church sought to send students to come to Germany. At a local council of the church held at Gelati in 1921, it was decided to send Peradze to continue further studies abroad. He was encouraged by his mentor, Cornelius Kekelidze, and the head of the Georgian Orthodox Church, Catholicos-Patriarch Ambrose. This was done with the help of German Kartvelologist Arthur Leist and the head of the Oriental mission in Potsdam, Johannes Lepsius, through the German ambassador to Georgia.http://www.golubinski.ru/russia/borovoy/–ì—Ä–∏–≥–æ—Ä–∏–π%20(–ü–µ—Ä–∞–¥–∑–µ%20–ì—Ä–∏–≥–æ–ª%20–†–∞–º–∞–Ω–æ–∑–æ–≤–∏—á).htm Grigol was able to study in Berlin and later Bonn.matiane.wordpress.com/2009/10/22/chemi-patriarki-grigol-feradz/amp/ In 1926 he graduated from the University of Bonn (Germany). In December 1927 he received a PhD degree in history (the title of his PhD thesis was History of the Georgian Monasticism from its creation until 1064).Ibid. From 1927 to 1932 Peradze was an associate professor at the University of Bonn. From 1933 to 1942 he was a professor of patrology at the Faculty of Orthodox Theology of Warsaw University, in Poland. In the spring of 1927 Peradze spent time researching manuscripts in the British Museum and the Bodlean Library at Oxford.http://www.kosciol.pl/article.php/20041230232911240/print Around Christmas in 1930 Peradze became seriously ill, and pledged that he would devote himself to God if he recovered.http://tbiliselebi.ge/index.php?newsid=268452128 On April 18, 1931, Peradze was tonsured a monk at Holy Wisdom Greek Orthodox Cathedral in London, followed the next day by being named a hierodiakon. Five weeks later, on May 24, he was ordained a priest at St. Stephen‚Äôs Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Paris. In 1931 he became the first regular priest of the Georgian St. Nino Orthodox church in Paris, which had been established by laymen in 1929, where he celebrated his first liturgy on May 31.KulminacjƒÖ d≈Çugotrwa≈Çej walki wewnƒôtrznej sta≈Ça siƒô ciƒô≈ºka choroba w okresie ≈õwiƒÖt Bo≈ºego Narodzenia 1930 r.

During this time, Peradze lived in a small apartment in Warsaw's Praga District at 22 Brukowej St. (today Okrzei St.), where he kept his large collection of Georgian antiquities.http://ngp.pl/str/tekst3394.html The invasion of Poland by German troops in 1939 made Peradze's position precarious. For him being in solidarity with Jews in peril went without saying; and he helped wherever he could. Nor did he hesitate to visit the imprisoned Polish metropolitan Dionysios. These activities were viewed with growing suspicion by the Nazi occupiers, and Peradze's fruitful ecclesiastic and scientific activities were brought to an end in 1942 when, on May 4, he was arrested by the German Gestapo.Lukas Vischer: A Georgian Saint: Grigol Peradze (1899-1942) On December 6, 1942, Peradze was killed in the Nazi concentration camp of Auschwitz (O≈õwiƒôcim) when he took the blame for the murder of a German officer to spare his fellow prisoners, or, according to another report, when he entered a gas chamber in the place of a Jewish prisoner who had a large family.Archpriest Zakaria Machitadze, Lives of the Georgian Saints, trans.

The Feast Day for St. Priest Martyr Grigol is December 6 (or November 23, Old Style). In 2013, he was posthumously awarded the title and Order of National Hero of Georgia.

While they may be studied for various reasons, martial arts share a single objective: to physically defeat other persons and to defend oneself or others from physical threat. In addition, some martial arts are linked to beliefs such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Daoism, Confucianism or Shinto while others follow a particular code of honor. Many arts are also practised competitively, most commonly as combat sports, but may also take the form of dance.  Types of martial arts  Boxing is a sport where two participants of similar weight attack each other with their fists in a series of one to three-minute intervals called \\"rounds\\". Modern boxing began in 1867 with the Marquess of Queensberry rules.

It is located along the waterfront of Upper New York Bay, roughly bounded on the north by Tompkinsville at Grant Street, on the south by Clifton at Vanderbilt Avenue, and on the west by St. Paul's Avenue and Van Duzer Street, which form the border with the community of Grymes Hill. Stapleton is one of the older waterfront neighborhoods of the borough, built in the 1830s on land once owned by the Vanderbilt family. It was a long-time commercial center of the island, but has struggled to revive after several decades of neglect following the 1964 construction of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, which shifted the commercial development of the island to its interior. Stapleton is part of Staten Island Community District 1 and its ZIP Codes are 10304 and 10301. Stapleton is patrolled by the 120th Precinct of the New York City Police Department.  History  = 19th century = Business Section, Stapleton, mid-20th century The neighborhood was the site of the farm where Cornelius Vanderbilt grew up, at the location of the present-day Paramount Theater building on Bay Street (the theater itself having closed in the early 1980s). In the early 19th century it became the commercial center of Southfield Township. In 1832 William J. Staples, a merchant from Manhattan for whom the neighborhood is named, as well as Minthorne Tompkins, the son of Vice President Daniel D. Tompkins, acquired land from the Vanderbilts and laid out the streets. Staples and Tompkins started a ferry service from the neighborhood waterfront to Manhattan and began advertising their new village in 1836. Seaman's Retreat, a hospital for sailors entering New York Harbor, opened in 1832 and later became Bayley Seton Hospital, the largest employer in the neighborhood until the Sisters of Charity, an order of Roman Catholic nuns which operated the facility, closed it in 2004. (The property is sometimes reckoned as being in Clifton, Stapleton's neighbor to the south.) It was also for many years the site of a United States Public Health Service hospital. The neighborhood was the location of several springs which led to the establishment of several German-American breweries in the middle 19th century. The last brewery closed in 1963. In 1884, Stapleton was incorporated as the village of Edgewater. The old Village Hall still stands, located in Tappen Park. In 1884, the Staten Island Railway extended its track from the neighborhood northward to St. George, with a stop at Stapleton station. Direct ferry service from the neighborhood to Manhattan was halted two years later in 1886. = 20th century = Between 1929 and 1931, Stapleton had its own NFL pro football team, the Staten Island Stapletons. In their last two years they were known as the Staten Island Stapes. This professional American football team was founded in 1915 and played in the National Football League from 1929 to 1932. Jack Shapiro, who was a blocking back for the Stapletons, was the shortest player in NFL history. In 1963, I.S.49, which sits across from the Stapleton Houses, opened. The Houses, a housing project sponsored by the State of New York, had opened two years earlier; at eight stories high, its buildings are the tallest within any such project on Staten Island, and is the largest New York City Housing Authority project in the borough.

From 1937 to 1942 several of the piers were used as the first Foreign Trade Zone in the United States. From 1942 to 1945, they became the Staten Island Terminal facility of the Army's New York Port of Embarkation. The U.S. Coast Guard operated their Section Base 2 there from the early 1920's until 1967, when they moved to Governors Island. After World War II, the piers once again became a foreign trade zone, but their use declined and most of the piers were demolished by the 1970s. The last, used for fishing, was removed when the U.S. Navy proposed to build a base in Stapleton in the 1980s. In 1983, Secretary of the Navy John Lehman selected Stapleton to be the homeport for a naval unit headed by the battleship , as part of the dispersal of the navy during a military build up ordered by President Ronald Reagan. This proposal became highly controversial throughout Staten Island when analysis of the proposal showed a net loss of civilian jobs on Staten Island (mainly due to expected job-seekers among naval dependents, but also due to a loss of businesses forced out by the naval presence). It was also controversial because of the belief that the Tomahawk cruise missiles aboard the Iowa and an accompanying Aegis cruiser would, in at least some cases, be carrying nuclear warheads. Following years of debate, which slowed development of the base, the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union led to a major cutback in military spending, and the still incomplete base was cancelled in 1993. Shortly thereafter, a plan was floated to build a race-track on the site, to be primarily used by NASCAR. The plan was quickly forgotten. Also headquartered at the site is one of three fireboats, FDNY Marine company 9. The site is now also used as part of the annual Fleet Week in New York City. After sitting empty for a couple of years, the base site was used by a bagel manufacturer briefly. Then a proposal was made to have a movie studio occupy a portion of the site. For never-explained reasons the city administration opposed this, and finally some of the civil courts took over a small part of the site, leaving most unused while various proposals were made for housing, parkland, and an educational complex, among others. On October 26, 2006, the New York City Council approved a massive redevelopment plan for the site. It will be transformed into a new community with 350 housing units, restaurants, parks, a recreation center and farmers' market. The City Council pushed the project through its final regulatory hurdle when it approved the $66 million blueprint for the former Navy base.NYC.gov Waterfront redevelopment, October 2006 The city will use the money and an additional $1.1 million state grant to create streets, utilities and a mile-long waterfront esplanade while soliciting proposals from private developers to build on six sites‚Äîthree residential and three commercial‚Äîacross the base. City officials have said infrastructure work could begin in early 2007 with a projected completion date of 2009. Demolition of the old Navy buildings began in late 2011.Home Port's Future Rolling Ahead NY1 On October 29, 2012, Hurricane Sandy threw the tanker John B. Caddell ashore on a vacant part of Front Street. Demographics For census purposes, the New York City government classifies Stapleton as part of a larger neighborhood tabulation area called Stapleton-Rosebank.New York City Neighborhood Tabulation Areas*, 2010, Population Division - New York City Department of City Planning, February 2012. Accessed June 16, 2016. Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Stapleton-Rosebank was 26,453, a change of 2,405 (9.1%) from the 24,048 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .Table PL-P5 NTA: Total Population and Persons Per Acre - New York City Neighborhood Tabulation Areas*, 2010, Population Division - New York City Department of City Planning, February 2012. Accessed June 16, 2016. The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 37.5% (9,910) White, 19.3% (5,097) African American, 0.3% (72) Native American, 9.7% (2,565) Asian, 0% (12) Pacific Islander, 0.4% (102) from other races, and 1.6% (427) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 31.3% (8,268) of the population.Table PL-P3A NTA: Total Population by Mutually Exclusive Race and Hispanic Origin - New York City Neighborhood Tabulation Areas*, 2010, Population Division - New York City Department of City Planning, March 29, 2011. Accessed June 14, 2016. The entirety of Community District 1, which comprises Stapleton and other neighborhoods on the North Shore, had 181,484 inhabitants as of NYC Health's 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 79.0 years. This is lower than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are youth and middle-aged adults: 24% are between the ages of between 0‚Äì17, 27% between 25‚Äì44, and 26% between 45‚Äì64. The ratio of college- aged and elderly residents was lower, at 10% and 13% respectively. As of 2017, the median household income in Community District 1 was $48,018, though the median income in Stapleton individually was $58,373. In 2018, an estimated 21% of Stapleton and the North Shore residents lived in poverty, compared to 17% in all of Staten Island and 20% in all of New York City. One in fourteen residents (7%) were unemployed, compared to 6% in Staten Island and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 51% in Stapleton and the North Shore, compared to the boroughwide and citywide rates of 49% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Stapleton and the North Shore are considered high-income relative to the rest of the city and not gentrifying. =Culture= The portions of the neighborhood around the Stapleton Houses have been predominantly Black for a while (though there has always been a noticeable White and Hispanic presence), while the areas further away have been a little bit more diverse. The overall neighborhood has seen a decrease in the White population, which reflects the overall trend of Whites moving back towards the city center (as well as those moving to newer suburbs further out). The local school, P.S. 14 (which has since become P.S. 78 due to P.S. 14's failing as a school) has seen a large increase in the Hispanic population, with the 2011‚Äì2012 school year being the first one in which Hispanics have made up the majority of the student body. This is reflective of the overall increase in the Hispanic population in the area. Community A Victorian home in Stapleton. Stapleton, like much of the North Shore, has two major coexisting cultural spheres: that based in the old, standalone homes that have been in the area since the Victorian era, and that based in the public housing projects. As such, it is just as common to find Spanish bodegas and vibrant street art as winding roads, used book stores, and coffee shops. Popular places for the performance of local music include The Full Cup, located on Van Duzer Street, and the Bay Street Saloon and Dock Street, both of which operate on Bay Street. In October 1980, the Paramount Theater began hosting acts such as The B-52s, the Talking Heads, Squeeze, the Dead Kennedys, Burning Spear and the Ramones, but it ceased functioning as a concert hall by the late 1980s. Other former venues include Beer Goggles and Martini Red, which is now known as The Hop Shoppe. The NYC Arts Cypher is located on Broad Street, and occasionally hosts hip-hop concerts, which distinguishes it from most other local venues, which cater mainly to rock and alternative bands. In recent years, the extreme sports scene has boomed on Staten Island. In July 2012, 5050 Skatepark was opened on Front Street across from the Homeport. 5050 Skatepark is New York City's only indoor skatepark, and one of the few skateparks open to BMX bikes, skateboarder, scooters, and rollerblades. The neighborhood also has a diverse selection of restaurants, including an American-style diner, a Gastropub, as well as Sri Lankan, Mexican, and Italian eateries. Chain restaurants also have a presence, including Subway and McDonald's. = Points of interest = In 1801, the local Union American Methodist Episcopal church was founded in the neighborhood. It still stands at 43 Tompkins Avenue and has a very active congregation, most of whom are descendants of former slaves on Staten Island. The church is the oldest African-American church in the borough and one of four which predate the 20th century. Edgewater Village Hall and Tappen Park, the old village hall of Stapleton, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. In addition to the Edgewater Village Hall and Tappen Park, the Boardman‚ÄìMitchell House, Houses at 364 and 390 Van Duzer Street, and St. Paul's Memorial Church and Rectory are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Police and crime Stapleton and the North Shore are patrolled by the 120th Precinct of the NYPD, located at 78 Richmond Terrace. The 120th Precinct ranked 12th safest out of 69 patrol areas for per-capita crime in 2010. , with a non-fatal assault rate of 94 per 100,000 people, Stapleton and the North Shore's rate of violent crimes per capita is more than that of the city as a whole. The incarceration rate of 719 per 100,000 people is higher than that of the city as a whole. The 120th Precinct has a lower crime rate than in the 1990s, with crimes across all categories having decreased by 85.4% between 1990 and 2018. The precinct reported 10 murders, 34 rapes, 147 robberies, 274 felony assaults, 152 burglaries, 304 grand larcenies, and 61 grand larcenies auto in 2018. Fire safety Stapleton is served by the New York City Fire Department (FDNY)'s Engine Co. 153/Ladder Co. 77, located at 74 Broad Street. Health , preterm births and births to teenage mothers are more common in Stapleton and the North Shore than in other places citywide. In Stapleton and the North Shore, there were 96 preterm births per 1,000 live births (compared to 87 per 1,000 citywide), and 22.6 births to teenage mothers per 1,000 live births (compared to 19.3 per 1,000 citywide). Stapleton and the North Shore have a relatively average population of residents who are uninsured. In 2018, this population of uninsured residents was estimated to be 12%, the same as the citywide rate of 12%. The concentration of fine particulate matter, the deadliest type of air pollutant, in Stapleton and the North Shore is , less than the city average. Sixteen percent of Stapleton and the North Shore residents are smokers, which is higher than the city average of 14% of residents being smokers. In Stapleton and the North Shore, 24% of residents are obese, 9% are diabetic, and 26% have high blood pressure‚Äîcompared to the citywide averages of 24%, 11%, and 28% respectively. In addition, 21% of children are obese, compared to the citywide average of 20%. Eighty-seven percent of residents eat some fruits and vegetables every day, which is the same as the city's average of 87%. In 2018, 77% of residents described their health as \\"good,\\" \\"very good,\\" or \\"excellent,\\" equal to the city's average of 78%. For every supermarket in Stapleton and the North Shore, there are 28 bodegas. The nearest major hospitals are Richmond University Medical Center in West New Brighton and Staten Island University Hospital in Dongan Hills. Post office and ZIP Codes Stapleton is located within the ZIP Code 10304 south of Clinton Street and 10301 north of Clinton Street. The United States Postal Service operates the Stapleton Station post office at 160 Tompkins Avenue.  Education  Stapleton and the North Shore generally have a lower rate of college-educated residents than the rest of the city . While 37% of residents age 25 and older have a college education or higher, 15% have less than a high school education and 48% are high school graduates or have some college education. By contrast, 39% of Staten Island residents and 43% of city residents have a college education or higher. The percentage of Stapleton and the North Shore students excelling in math rose from 49% in 2000 to 65% in 2011, though reading achievement declined from 55% to 51% during the same time period. Stapleton and the North Shore's rate of elementary school student absenteeism is slightly higher than the rest of New York City. In Stapleton and the North Shore, 25% of elementary school students missed twenty or more days per school year, more than the citywide average of 20%. Additionally, 73% of high school students in Stapleton and the North Shore graduate on time, about the same as the citywide average of 75%. =Schools= Dreyfus Intermediate School The New York City Department of Education operates the following public schools in Stapleton: * IS 49 Bertha A Dreyfus (grades 6-8) * PS 65 the Academy of Innovative Learning (grades PK-5) The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York operates Staten Island Catholic schools. Immaculate Conception School in Stapleton closed in 2013. The archdiocese stated that the number of students was too low and that the school could not receive enough income. It had 216 students in 2013. =Library= New York Public Library, Stapleton branch The New York Public Library (NYPL)'s Stapleton branch is located at 132 Canal Street at Wright Street. The Carrere & Hastings-designed Carnegie library was built in 1907. It underwent significant renovations and remodeling from 2011 to 2013, including the addition of a building. A minor controversy arose over the discrepancy of architectural styles between the modernist black-glass addition and the original structure. Transportation Due to its proximity to the Staten Island Ferry, Stapleton is well served by public transportation. The Staten Island Railway has a station of the same name at Prospect Street and Bay Street. Stapleton is also served by the local buses. Express bus service to and from Manhattan is provided by the route. Notable residents *Dennis Coles, a.k.a.

History Behavioral neuroscience as a scientific discipline emerged from a variety of scientific and philosophical traditions in the 18th and 19th centuries. In philosophy, people like Ren√© Descartes proposed physical models to explain animal as well as human behavior. Descartes suggested that the pineal gland, a midline unpaired structure in the brain of many organisms, was the point of contact between mind and body. Descartes also elaborated on a theory in which the pneumatics of bodily fluids could explain reflexes and other motor behavior. This theory was inspired by moving statues in a garden in Paris. Electrical stimulation and lesions can also show the affect of motor behavior of humans. They can record the electrical activity of actions, hormones, chemicals and effects drugs have in the body system all which affect ones daily behavior. William James Other philosophers also helped give birth to psychology. One of the earliest textbooks in the new field, The Principles of Psychology by William James, argues that the scientific study of psychology should be grounded in an understanding of biology. The emergence of psychology and behavioral neuroscience as legitimate sciences can be traced from the emergence of physiology from anatomy, particularly neuroanatomy. Physiologists conducted experiments on living organisms, a practice that was distrusted by the dominant anatomists of the 18th and 19th centuries. The influential work of Claude Bernard, Charles Bell, and William Harvey helped to convince the scientific community that reliable data could be obtained from living subjects. Even before the 18th and 19th century, behavioral neuroscience was beginning to take form as far back as 1700 B.C. The question that seems to continually arise is: what is the connection between the mind and body? The debate is formally referred to as the mind-body problem. There are two major schools of thought that attempt to resolve the mind‚Äìbody problem; monism and dualism. Plato and Aristotle are two of several philosophers who participated in this debate. Plato believed that the brain was where all mental thought and processes happened. In contrast, Aristotle believed the brain served the purpose of cooling down the emotions derived from the heart. The mind-body problem was a stepping stone toward attempting to understand the connection between the mind and body. Another debate arose about localization of function or functional specialization versus equipotentiality which played a significant role in the development in behavioral neuroscience. As a result of localization of function research, many famous people found within psychology have come to various different conclusions. Wilder Penfield was able to develop a map of the cerebral cortex through studying epileptic patients along with Rassmussen. Research on localization of function has led behavioral neuroscientists to a better understanding of which parts of the brain control behavior. This is best exemplified through the case study of Phineas Gage. The term \\"psychobiology\\" has been used in a variety of contexts, emphasizing the importance of biology, which is the discipline that studies organic, neural and cellular modifications in behavior, plasticity in neuroscience, and biological diseases in all aspects, in addition, biology focuses and analyzes behavior and all the subjects it is concerned about, from a scientific point of view. In this context, psychology helps as a complementary, but important discipline in the neurobiological sciences. The role of psychology in this questions is that of a social tool that backs up the main or strongest biological science. The term \\"psychobiology\\" was first used in its modern sense by Knight Dunlap in his book An Outline of Psychobiology (1914). Dunlap also was the founder and editor-in-chief of the journal Psychobiology. In the announcement of that journal, Dunlap writes that the journal will publish research \\"...bearing on the interconnection of mental and physiological functions\\", which describes the field of behavioral neuroscience even in its modern sense. Relationship to other fields of psychology and biology In many cases, humans may serve as experimental subjects in behavioral neuroscience experiments; however, a great deal of the experimental literature in behavioral neuroscience comes from the study of non-human species, most frequently rats, mice, and monkeys. As a result, a critical assumption in behavioral neuroscience is that organisms share biological and behavioral similarities, enough to permit extrapolations across species. This allies behavioral neuroscience closely with comparative psychology, evolutionary psychology, evolutionary biology, and neurobiology. Behavioral neuroscience also has paradigmatic and methodological similarities to neuropsychology, which relies heavily on the study of the behavior of humans with nervous system dysfunction (i.e., a non-experimentally based biological manipulation). Synonyms for behavioral neuroscience include biopsychology, biological psychology, and psychobiology.S. Marc Breedlove, Mark Rosenzweig and Neil V. Watson (2007). Biological Psychology: An Introduction to Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience 6e. Sinauer Associates. Physiological psychology is a subfield of behavioral neuroscience, with an appropriately narrower definition  Research methods  The distinguishing characteristic of a behavioral neuroscience experiment is that either the independent variable of the experiment is biological, or some dependent variable is biological. In other words, the nervous system of the organism under study is permanently or temporarily altered, or some aspect of the nervous system is measured (usually to be related to a behavioral variable). =Disabling or decreasing neural function= * Lesions ‚Äì A classic method in which a brain-region of interest is naturally or intentionally destroyed to observe any resulting changes such as degraded or enhanced performance on some behavioral measure. Lesions can be placed with relatively high accuracy \\"Thanks to a variety of brain 'atlases' which provide a map of brain regions in 3-dimensional \\"stereotactic coordinates.The part of the picture emphasized shows the lesion in the brain. This type of lesion can be removed through surgery. **Surgical lesions ‚Äì Neural tissue is destroyed by removing it surgically. ** Electrolytic lesions ‚Äì Neural tissue is destroyed through the application of electrical shock trauma. ** Chemical lesions ‚Äì Neural tissue is destroyed by the infusion of a neurotoxin. ** Temporary lesions ‚Äì Neural tissue is temporarily disabled by cooling or by the use of anesthetics such as tetrodotoxin. * Transcranial magnetic stimulation ‚Äì A new technique usually used with human subjects in which a magnetic coil applied to the scalp causes unsystematic electrical activity in nearby cortical neurons which can be experimentally analyzed as a functional lesion. * Synthetic ligand injection ‚Äì A receptor activated solely by a synthetic ligand (RASSL) or Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD), permits spatial and temporal control of G protein signaling in vivo. These systems utilize G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) engineered to respond exclusively to synthetic small molecules ligands, like clozapine N-oxide (CNO), and not to their natural ligand(s). RASSL's represent a GPCR-based chemogenetic tool. These synthetic ligands upon activation can decrease neural function by G-protein activation. This can with Potassium attenuating neural activity. * Psychopharmacological manipulations ‚Äì A chemical receptor antagonist induces neural activity by interfering with neurotransmission. Antagonists can be delivered systemically (such as by intravenous injection) or locally (intracerebrally) during a surgical procedure into the ventricles or into specific brain structures. For example, NMDA antagonist AP5 has been shown to inhibit the initiation of long term potentiation of excitatory synaptic transmission (in rodent fear conditioning) which is believed to be a vital mechanism in learning and memory. * Optogenetic inhibition ‚Äì A light activated inhibitory protein is expressed in cells of interest. Powerful millisecond timescale neuronal inhibition is instigated upon stimulation by the appropriate frequency of light delivered via fiber optics or implanted LEDs in the case of vertebrates, or via external illumination for small, sufficiently translucent invertebrates. Bacterial Halorhodopsins or Proton pumps are the two classes of proteins used for inhibitory optogenetics, achieving inhibition by increasing cytoplasmic levels of halides () or decreasing the cytoplasmic concentration of protons, respectively.Chow, B. Y. et al. \\"High-performance genetically targetable optical neural silencing by light-driven proton pumps.\\" Nature. Vol 463. 7 January 2010 = Enhancing neural function = * Electrical stimulation ‚Äì A classic method in which neural activity is enhanced by application of a small electric current (too small to cause significant cell death). * Psychopharmacological manipulations ‚Äì A chemical receptor agonist facilitates neural activity by enhancing or replacing endogenous neurotransmitters. Agonists can be delivered systemically (such as by intravenous injection) or locally (intracerebrally) during a surgical procedure. * Synthetic Ligand Injection ‚Äì Likewise, Gq-DREADDs can be used to modulate cellular function by innervation of brain regions such as Hippocampus. This innervation results in the amplification of Œ≥-rhythms, which increases motor activity. * Transcranial magnetic stimulation ‚Äì In some cases (for example, studies of motor cortex), this technique can be analyzed as having a stimulatory effect (rather than as a functional lesion). * Optogenetic excitation ‚Äì A light activated excitatory protein is expressed in select cells. Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), a light activated cation channel, was the first bacterial opsin shown to excite neurons in response to light, though a number of new excitatory optogenetic tools have now been generated by improving and imparting novel properties to ChR2 = Measuring neural activity = * Optical techniques ‚Äì Optical methods for recording neuronal activity rely on methods that modify the optical properties of neurons in response to the cellular events associated with action potentials or neurotransmitter release. **Voltage sensitive dyes (VSDs) were among the earliest method for optically detecting neuronal activity. VSDs commonly changed their fluorescent properties in response to a voltage change across the neuron's membrane, rendering membrane sub-threshold and supra- threshold (action potentials) electrical activity detectable. Genetically encoded voltage sensitive fluorescent proteins have also been developed. ** Calcium imaging relies on dyes or genetically encoded proteins that fluoresce upon binding to the calcium that is transiently present during an action potential. ** Synapto-pHluorin is a technique that relies on a fusion protein that combines a synaptic vesicle membrane protein and a pH sensitive fluorescent protein. Upon synaptic vesicle release, the chimeric protein is exposed to the higher pH of the synaptic cleft, causing a measurable change in fluorescence. * Single-unit recording ‚Äì A method whereby an electrode is introduced into the brain of a living animal to detect electrical activity that is generated by the neurons adjacent to the electrode tip. Normally this is performed with sedated animals but sometimes it is performed on awake animals engaged in a behavioral event, such as a thirsty rat whisking a particular sandpaper grade previously paired with water in order to measure the corresponding patterns of neuronal firing at the decision point. * Multielectrode recording ‚Äì The use of a bundle of fine electrodes to record the simultaneous activity of up to hundreds of neurons. * fMRI ‚Äì Functional magnetic resonance imaging, a technique most frequently applied on human subjects, in which changes in cerebral blood flow can be detected in an MRI apparatus and are taken to indicate relative activity of larger scale brain regions (i.e., on the order of hundreds of thousands of neurons). *PET brain scans can show chemical differences in the brain between addicts and non- addicts. You can see the normal images in the top row come from non addict while people who have addicting disorders have scans that look more abnormal.PET - Positron Emission Tomography detects particles called photons using a 3-D nuclear medicine examination. These particles are emitted by injections of radioisotopes such as fluorine. PET imaging reveal the pathological processes which predict anatomic changes making it important for detecting, diagnosing and characterising many pathologies * Electroencephalography ‚Äì Or EEG; and the derivative technique of event-related potentials, in which scalp electrodes monitor the average activity of neurons in the cortex (again, used most frequently with human subjects). This technique uses different types of electrodes for recording systems such as needle electrodes and saline-based electrodes. EEG allows for the investigation of mental disorders, sleep disorders and physiology. It can monitor brain development and cognitive engagement.Sanei, S., & Chambers, J. A. (2013). EEG signal processing. John Wiley & Sons. * Functional neuroanatomy ‚Äì A more complex counterpart of phrenology. The expression of some anatomical marker is taken to reflect neural activity. For example, the expression of immediate early genes is thought to be caused by vigorous neural activity. Likewise, the injection of 2-deoxyglucose prior to some behavioral task can be followed by anatomical localization of that chemical; it is taken up by neurons that are electrically active. * MEG ‚Äì Magnetoencephalography shows the functioning of the human brain through the measurement of electromagnetic activity. Measuring the magnetic fields created by the electric current flowing within the neurons identifies brain activity associated with various human functions in real time, with millimeter spatial accuracy. Clinicians can noninvasively obtain data to help them assess neurological disorders and plan surgical treatments. = Genetic techniques = * QTL mapping ‚Äì The influence of a gene in some behavior can be statistically inferred by studying inbred strains of some species, most commonly mice. The recent sequencing of the genome of many species, most notably mice, has facilitated this technique. * Selective breeding ‚Äì Organisms, often mice, may be bred selectively among inbred strains to create a recombinant congenic strain. This might be done to isolate an experimentally interesting stretch of DNA derived from one strain on the background genome of another strain to allow stronger inferences about the role of that stretch of DNA. * Genetic engineering ‚Äì The genome may also be experimentally-manipulated; for example, knockout mice can be engineered to lack a particular gene, or a gene may be expressed in a strain which does not normally do so (the 'transgenic'). Advanced techniques may also permit the expression or suppression of a gene to occur by injection of some regulating chemical.  Other research methods  Computational models - Using a computer to formulate real-world problems to develop solutions.Otago, U. o., n/d. Computational Modelling. [Online] Available at: http://www.otago.ac.nz/courses/otago032670.pdf Although this method is often focused in computer science, it has begun to move towards other areas of study. For example, psychology is one of these areas. Computational models allow researchers in psychology to enhance their understanding of the functions and developments in nervous systems. Examples of methods include the modelling of neurons, networks and brain systems and theoretical analysis.Churchland, P. S., & Sejnowski, T. J. (2016). The computational brain. MIT press. Computational methods have a wide variety of roles including clarifying experiments, hypothesis testing and generating new insights. These techniques play an increasing role in the advancement of biological psychology. = Limitations and advantages = Different manipulations have advantages and limitations. Neural tissue destroyed as a primary consequence of a surgery, electric shock or neurotoxin can confound the results so that the physical trauma masks changes in the fundamental neurophysiological processes of interest. For example, when using an electrolytic probe to create a purposeful lesion in a distinct region of the rat brain, surrounding tissue can be affected: so, a change in behavior exhibited by the experimental group post-surgery is to some degree a result of damage to surrounding neural tissue, rather than by a lesion of a distinct brain region. Most genetic manipulation techniques are also considered permanent. Temporary lesions can be achieved with advanced in genetic manipulations, for example, certain genes can now be switched on and off with diet. Pharmacological manipulations also allow blocking of certain neurotransmitters temporarily as the function returns to its previous state after the drug has been metabolized.  Topic areas  In general, behavioral neuroscientists study similar themes and issues as academic psychologists, though limited by the need to use nonhuman animals. As a result, the bulk of literature in behavioral neuroscience deals with mental processes and behaviors that are shared across different animal models such as: *Sensation and perception *Motivated behavior (hunger, thirst, sex) *Control of movement *Learning and memory *Sleep and biological rhythms *Emotion However, with increasing technical sophistication and with the development of more precise noninvasive methods that can be applied to human subjects, behavioral neuroscientists are beginning to contribute to other classical topic areas of psychology, philosophy, and linguistics, such as: *Language *Reasoning and decision making *Consciousness Behavioral neuroscience has also had a strong history of contributing to the understanding of medical disorders, including those that fall under the purview of clinical psychology and biological psychopathology (also known as abnormal psychology). Although animal models do not exist for all mental illnesses, the field has contributed important therapeutic data on a variety of conditions, including: *Parkinson's disease, a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that often impairs the sufferer's motor skills and speech. *Huntington's disease, a rare inherited neurological disorder whose most obvious symptoms are abnormal body movements and a lack of coordination. It also affects a number of mental abilities and some aspects of personality. *Alzheimer's disease, a neurodegenerative disease that, in its most common form, is found in people over the age of 65 and is characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration, together with declining activities of daily living and by neuropsychiatric symptoms or behavioral changes. *Clinical depression, a common psychiatric disorder, characterized by a persistent lowering of mood, loss of interest in usual activities and diminished ability to experience pleasure. *Schizophrenia, a psychiatric diagnosis that describes a mental illness characterized by impairments in the perception or expression of reality, most commonly manifesting as auditory hallucinations, paranoid or bizarre delusions or disorganized speech and thinking in the context of significant social or occupational dysfunction. *Autism, a brain development disorder that impairs social interaction and communication, and causes restricted and repetitive behavior, all starting before a child is three years old. *Anxiety, a physiological state characterized by cognitive, somatic, emotional, and behavioral components. These components combine to create the feelings that are typically recognized as fear, apprehension, or worry. *Drug abuse, including alcoholism.

Roosevelt in Heuvelton near Ogdensburg, New York on August 17, 1940. It outlined a permanent plan for mutual defense overseas between the United States and Canada and established the Permanent Joint Board of Defense. History and Rationale Although Canada and the United States had long been economic partners, Canada had always considered Great Britain as its primary military partner. While Canada had been granted independence in its foreign policy from Britain in 1931, Canada's membership in the Commonwealth of Nations, the strength of the British Empire, and the historic and cultural ties between them made a military alliance with the United States seem unnecessary. Most Canadians believed that Britain could provide for all of Canada's defence needs. Canada had declared war on Nazi Germany shortly after the Second World War began in early September 1939 but the United States remained neutral. By mid-1940, the situation in Europe had grown dire; Germany's military successes had led to the occupation of most of Europe, and most importantly, France, which surrendered in June 1940. With Germany in control or allied with nearly all of continental Europe, it began to develop plans for an invasion of the British Isles. Germany's seemingly unstoppable military, its submarine campaign against British merchant shipping, and its neutrality pact with the Soviet Union, convinced many, including American President Franklin Roosevelt, that Britain itself would soon be invaded or forced to surrender. By July 1940, Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, along with a growing number of Canadians, was becoming increasingly concerned that Britain would fall and that Canada, with its small population and abundant natural resources, would become Germany's next target. In addition to transferring its gold reserves to Canada at the beginning of the war, the British government had also prepared a contingency plan (which was largely kept secret to avoid hurting morale) to evacuate the Royal family, the government and as many critical military and scientific personnel to Canada as possible if the British Isles fell to Germany. These factors only increased concerns that Germany would eventually target Canada for its next conquest. Both Canada and the United States recognized this threat. Subsequently, it was the United States that initiated preliminary military discussions that became formative in July 1940. On August 18, Roosevelt and King met inland from the border town of Ogdensburg, New York. Roosevelt outlined his plan to create a joint board to oversee the defence of both nations, not just for the duration of the current crisis, but as a permanent body. King immediately agreed, and the Permanent Joint Board on Defence was created. Most Canadians supported this agreement, which was soon known as the Ogdensburg Agreement, as they deemed it necessary not only for security purposes but also to improve relations with the United States (it was also hoped that the agreement would help pull the United States into the war). However, some Canadians, most notably former Conservative prime minister Arthur Meighen were furious - they argued that by signing this agreement, Canada was not only abandoning Britain but was effectively placing itself under the control of the United States. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was also angry, stating that \\"all these transactions will be judged [at the end of the war] in a mood different to that prevailing while the issue still hangs in the balance.\\" King's government recognized these concerns; Canadian negotiators resolutely refused to give the United States control of Canada's forces, and rejected proposals to integrate much of the country's defences into Washington's Northeast and Northwest Defence Commands. King's approach satisfied most Canadians - although co- operation with the United States was essential, it did not mean abandoning Canada's national interests.Canada and the World: A History - 1939 - 1945: The World at War , Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada (DFAIT). Since World War II The agreement inaugurated closer Canadian- United States military co-operation and established the Permanent Joint Board of Defence, which remains as the senior advisory body on continental security and which is composed of two national sections made up of diplomatic and military representatives. For seven decades its meetings have served as a window on Canada-U.S.A. Defence relations. Canadian-U.S.A. military cooperation was further enhanced by the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949 but the Board continued to serve in an important capacity for bilateral military relations and coordination. Initially, it was argued that Ogdensburg Agreement involved Canada abandoning Britain in favour of the United States on matters of defence. However, the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949 (which linked Canada and the United States into a collective security agreement with Britain and Western Europe) helped to alleviate these concerns. The Board has examined virtually every important joint defence measure undertaken since the end of World War II, including construction of the (DEW-line) Canadian slang -- Distant Early Warning Line of radars, the creation of the North American Aerospace Defence Command (NORAD) in 1958. The bi-national operation of total North America Defence. North American Air Defense Modernization program in 1985. To this day, The Ogdensburg Agreement stands paramount in all background military operations between the United States and Canada. The DEW-Line has been dismantled due to Satellite Improvement Technology and now relies on innovation driven by the Internet. Many outposts still physically stand, like in Sudbury Ontario, but have been cut in service and are nothing but dead historical monuments.

The vigorous genius of the earlier golden day had left no sons. Emily Dickinson is the heir of Emerson's spirit, and Sarah Jewett the daughter of Hawthorne's style.\\" F.O. Matthiessen, Sarah Orne Jewett, public.coe.edu, Retrieved December 19, 2013 Early life Sarah Orne Jewett was born in South Berwick, Maine. Her family had been residents of New England for many generations.Her mother's family, the Gilmans, were among the most prominent settlers of Exeter, New Hampshire. Sarah's great-grandfather, James Orne, was descended from the Orne family of Dover, New Hampshire, who were among the first settlers of Dover. The Jewetts had emigrated from Yorkshire to Boston in 1638 and later founded Rowley, Massachusetts. From there they moved on to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, just after the Revolutionary War. Jewett's father, Theodore Herman Jewett, was a doctor specializing in \\"obstetrics and diseases of women and children,\\" and Jewett often accompanied him on his rounds, becoming acquainted with the sights and sounds of her native land and its people.Richard Cary, Sarah Orne Jewett (New Haven, CT: Twayne, 1962), 21. Her mother was Caroline Frances (Perry).https://www.historicnewengland.org/explore/collections- access/capobject/?refd=MS014.01.06 As treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, a condition that developed in her early childhood, Jewett was sent on frequent walks and through them also developed a love of nature.For instance, one stroll she found \\"neighborly with the hop-toads and with a joyful robin who was sitting on a corner of the barn, and I became very intimate with a great poppy which had made every arrangement to bloom as soon as the sun came up.\\" Fields, ed. Letters of Sarah Orne Jewett, 45. In later life, Jewett often visited Boston, where she was acquainted with many of the most influential literary figures of her day; but she always returned to South Berwick, small seaports near which were the inspiration for the towns of \\"Deephaven\\" and \\"Dunnet Landing\\" in her stories.The Country of the Pointed Firs at The Sarah Orne Jewett Text Project. Jewett was educated at Miss Olive Rayne's school and then at Berwick Academy, graduating in 1866.\\"Two Unidentified Newspaper Pieces on Olive Raynes\\" at The Sarah Orne Jewett Text Project. She supplemented her education with reading in her extensive family library. Jewett was \\"never overtly religious\\", but after she joined the Episcopal church in 1871, she explored less conventional religious ideas. For example, her friendship with Harvard law professor Theophilus Parsons stimulated an interest in the teachings of Emanuel Swedenborg, an eighteenth-century Swedish scientist and theologian, who believed that the Divine \\"was present in innumerable, joined forms ‚Äî a concept underlying Jewett's belief in individual responsibility.\\"Margaret A.

Career Sarah Orne Jewett reading. At age 19, Jewett published her first important story in the Atlantic Monthly, and her reputation grew throughout the 1870s and 1880s. Her literary importance arises from her careful, if subdued, vignettes of country life that reflect a contemporary interest in local color rather than in plot.Cary, 17-18, 52, 94. Jewett possessed a keen descriptive gift that William Dean Howells called \\"an uncommon feeling for talk ‚Äî I hear your people.\\" Jewett made her reputation with the novella The Country of the Pointed Firs (1896).Cary, 29. Jewett wrote to a teenage reader: \\"I cannot tell you just where Dunnet Landing is except that it must be somewhere 'along shore' between the regions of Tenants Harbor and Boothbay, or it might be farther to the eastward in a country that I know less well.\\" Sarah Orne Jewett Text Project. A Country Doctor (1884), a novel reflecting her father and her early ambitions for a medical career, and A White Heron (1886), a collection of short stories are among her finest work.Cary, 12, 29. Some of Jewett's poetry was collected in Verses (1916), and she also wrote three children's books. Willa Cather described Jewett as a significant influence on her development as a writer,Oxford Companion to American Literature, 382 and \\"feminist critics have since championed her writing for its rich account of women's lives and voices.\\" In 1901 Bowdoin College conferred an honorary doctorate of literature on Jewett, the first woman to be granted an honorary degree by Bowdoin. Later life Sarah Orne Jewett.Jewett never married, but she established a close friendship with writer Annie Adams Fields (1834‚Äì1915) and her husband, publisher James Thomas Fields, editor of the Atlantic Monthly. After the sudden death of James Fields in 1881, Jewett and Annie Fields lived together for the rest of Jewett's life in what was then termed a \\"Boston marriage\\". Some modern scholars have speculated that the two were lovers.See, for instance, Dottie Webb,\\"Sarah Orne Jewett and Annie Adams Fields: Boston Marriage and Cultural Nexus,\\" There is a more cautious appraisal on the website of the Sarah Orne Jewett Text Project. Fields was fifteen years older than Jewett, but they had similar tastes in \\"reading, writing, and the arts.\\" Richard Cary, Sarah Orne Jewett (New Haven, CT: Twayne, 1962), 25.

It was developed at the University of California, Berkeley, designed by Thomas Anderson, and is used by numerous schools around the world. Originally written in C++ for MIPS, Nachos runs as a user-process on a host operating system. A MIPS simulator executes the code for any user programs running on top of the Nachos operating system. Ports of the Nachos code exist for a variety of architectures. In addition to the Nachos code, a number of assignments are provided with the Nachos system. The goal of Nachos is to introduce students to concepts in operating system design and implementation by requiring them to implement significant pieces of functionality within the Nachos system. In Nachos' case, Operating System simulator simply means that you can run an OS (a guest OS) on top of another one (the host OS), similar to Bochs/VMware. It features emulation for: * A CPU (a MIPS CPU) * A hard drive * An interrupt controller, timer, and misc. other components which are there to run the Nachos user space applications. That means that you can write programs for Nachos, compile them with a real compiler (an old gcc compiler that produces code for MIPS) and run them. The Nachos kernel instead is compiled to the platform of the Host OS and thus runs natively on the Host OS' CPU. Nachos version 3.4 has been the stable, commonly used version of Nachos for many years. Nachos version 4.0 has existed as a beta since approximately 1996. Implementation Nachos has various modules implementing the functionality of a basic operating system. The wrapper functions for various system calls of the OS kernel are generally implemented in a manner similar to that of the UNIX system calls . Various parts of the OS are instantiated as objects using the native code. For example, a class \`Machine\`is used as the master class of the simulated machine. It contains various objects, such as \`FileSystem\`, \`Processor\`, \`Timer\`, etc. which are defined to simulate various hardware aspects. =Major components= NachOS Machine - Nachos simulates a machine that roughly approximates the MIPS architecture. The machine has registers, memory and a cpu. The Nachos/MIPS machine is implemented by the Machine object, an instance of which is created when Nachos starts up. It contains methods like Run, ReadRegister, WriteRegister, etc. It also defines an interrupt object to handle interrupts. Timer and statistics are also implemented in this. NachOS Threads - In NachOS a thread class has been defined. A thread has an associated state with it which maybe ready, running, blocked or just created. The thread object has various methods like PutThreadToSleep, YieldCPU, ThreadFork, ThreadStackAllocate, etc. Each thread runs at a virtual address space. NachOS UserPrograms - Nachos runs user programs in their own private address space. Nachos can run any MIPS binary, assuming that it restricts itself to only making system calls that Nachos understands. In Unix, \\"a.out\\" files are stored in \\"coff\\" format. Nachos requires that executables be in the simpler \\"Noff\\" format. To convert binaries of one format to the other, use the coff2noff program. Successors As Nachos has not been in active development for a number of years, and possesses a number of recognized flaws (particularly with regards to portability: Nachos relies on MIPS assembly code, and requires porting to run on x86 architecture), successor projects have been initiated. In 2004, Stanford University created Pintos, a Nachos-inspired system written in C and designed to run on actual x86 hardware. In 2000, Dan Hettena at UC Berkeley ported Nachos to Java as Nachos 5.0j, in an effort to make Nachos more portable, more accessible to undergraduates, and less susceptible to subtle bugs in student code that had in earlier versions often dominated student project development time. Another Java-based version was created by Professor Peter Druschel at Rice University. It was later adapted by Professor Eugene Stark at Stony Brook University in 2003 and applied in the Operating System course. At Graz University of Technology (Austria), a system called SWEB (\\"Schon wieder ein Betriebssystem\\") has been implemented and is used to teach operating system principles.

Blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, cranberries, serviceberries, ferns, mosses, cattails, and mushrooms also grow here, as well as many more shrubs and wildflowers. White-tailed deer are numerous and are hit by motorists on roads in northern Wisconsin year-round. Black bears, foxes, raccoons, rabbits, beavers, river otters, squirrels, chipmunks, pheasants, grouse and wild turkeys are popular game in the woods. Elk and wolves have been reintroduced and there have been sightings of moose and pine marten. Bird species include northern cardinal, blue jay, Canada jay, common raven, boreal and black-capped chickadees, black-backed and pileated woodpeckers, red-winged blackbirds, owls, ducks, common loons, bald eagles, evening grosbeaks, red and white- winged crossbills and many species of thrushes, sparrows and warblers. Brook trout, rainbow trout, and brown trout are found in many miles of excellent streams. Walleye, small and largemouth bass, crappie, northern pike, and many species of panfish make the area's lakes famous for freshwater fishing. A record making muskellunge, Wisconsin's state fish, was caught in these waters. The beauty, heritage, and recreational opportunities of these forests draw thousands of tourists to the Chequamegon‚ÄìNicolet area every year. These national forests are best known for recreation, including camping, hiking, fishing, cross country skiing, and snowmobiling. The Chequamegon National Forest was also home to one of the two extremely low frequency antennae in the United States.

Founded in the early 19th century as a Church-sponsored beneficent Sisterhood for female African slaves and former slaves, it became one of the oldest and most respected worship groups for Candombl√©, the major African-based religion in Brazil. Presently reduced to about thirty members (from 200 or so at its height), most of them over fifty, it still attracts worshipers every year, especially at its August festival. History The history of the Irmandade da Boa Morte (\\"Sisterhood of the Good Death\\"), a religious confraternity devoted to the Assumption of the Virgin, is part of the history of mass importation of blacks from the African coast to the cane- growing catchment area around the port of Salvador, Bahia, known as the Rec√¥ncavo Baiano. Iberian adventurers built several towns in this area, one of them being Cachoeira, which was the second most important economic center in Bahia for three centuries.http://celebratingwomen.com/cw_pagesv2/NYTArticle.html =Origin of confraternities= Confraternities proliferated during the 19th century, when the country was independent but still lived under the regime of slavery. For each profession, race and nation -- because the African slaves and their descendants came from different places with different cultures -- a separate irmandade was founded. There were confraternities for the rich, poor, musicians, blacks, whites, etc. There were almost none for women and in the male confraternities women entered as dependents to ensure they would receive benefits from the corporation after the death of their husbands. For the confraternity to operate, says historian Jo√£o Jos√© Reis, a church had to welcome it and its statutes had to be approved by an ecclesiastical authority. In a patriarchal society marked by racial and ethnic differences, the confraternity is made up exclusively of black women, which gives this Afro- Catholic manifestation -- as some consider it -- a certain fame. It is known both as an expression of Brazilian baroque Catholicism, with its distinctive street processions, and for its tendency to include in religious festivals profane rituals punctuated by a lot of samba and banqueting. Besides the gender and race of the confraternity's members, their status as former slaves and descendants of slaves is an important social characteristic without which it would be difficult to understand many aspects of the confraternity's religious commitments. The former slaves have demonstrated enormous adroitness in worshiping in the religion of those in power without letting go of their ancestral beliefs, as well as in the ways they defend the interests of their followers and represent them socially and politically. =Date of foundation= No one really knows in what year the Sisterhood of the Good Death was founded. Odorico speculates that the organized devotion began in 1820 in the Church of Ros√°rio in Barroquinha, a borough of Salvador; and that G√™ges (blacks of the Ewe and Fon ethnicities) who moved from there to Cachoeira were responsible for organizing it. Others speak of that period too, but disagree about the nation of the pioneers, saying they were freed Ketus (ethnic Yorubas). It seems that the membership of the confraternity had a variety of ethnic origins and that they numbered more than a hundred in the first years. Historically, the year 1820 makes sense. Since early in the nineteenth century, progress had been afoot in the Rec√¥ncavo and new agricultural and industrial techniques were introduced there. While the sugar economy was experiencing difficulties, tobacco gained new strength when it attracted the interest of German capital following the political independence of Brazil. The opening of motorized shipping lines strengthened the breeze of economic renewal, stimulating the integration of the Rec√¥ncavo with the provincial capital and increasing trade. This in turn encouraged the formation of strong links between black slaves in many cities, especially Salvador and Cachoeira. Jeferson Bacelar notes that the 1820s, especially the first three years of the decade, were marked by a process of agitation and excitement among the people of Bahia, many of whom - regardless of social class - were involved in a struggle for Independence that was marked by a strong anti- Portuguese spirit and armed skirmishes. The easing of tension between masters and slaves elicited by this momentary ‚Äúunity‚Äù contributed to the permanent removal of blacks to the cities of the Rec√¥ncavo, where slaveowners were very interested in solving the conflict and, to defend their interests, armed the slaves and used them against the Portuguese. This exceptional state of affairs resulted in a large number of religious and civil initiatives by the slaves, among them, perhaps, the Irmandade da Boa Morte. Ant√¥nio Moraes Ribeiro's research associates the confraternity's emergence from the slave quarters with the abolitionist atmosphere after the brutally crushed revolt of Muslim slaves in Bahia in 1835. Perhaps that is the origin of the clearly Islamic touch to the confraternity's very beautiful traditional clothes. As Raul Lody notes, the costume's impressiveness is heightened by the use of a turban. Ant√¥nio Moraes believes that one of the probable leaders of the Islamic Revolt, Luiza Mahim, was personally involved in the founding of the confraternity after her flight from Salvador to the Rec√¥ncavo. =From Church to Church= Luiz Cl√°udio Nascimento, an historian from Cachoeira, says that the first liturgies of the black Sisterhood were held in the Church of the Third Order of Carmo, traditionally used by the local elites. Later the sisters moved to the Church of Santa B√°rbara in the Santa Casa de Miseric√≥rdia hospital, where there are images of Our Lady of Glory and Our Lady of the Good Death. From there they moved to the Church of Amparo (which was demolished in 1946 and replaced by a middle class housing project). They left that church for the Parish Church (Igreja Matriz), and then went to the Church of Ajuda. Many confraternities built their own churches. This was the case of the Church of Ros√°rio in Barroquinha. The Sisterhood of Good Death maintained close contact with this church and its confraternity. =Social role= The religious confraternities of the 19th century -- like the secular ones such as the Society for the Protection of the Handicapped, a case studied by the anthropologist Julio Braga -- did more than revere Catholic saints and the orix√°s, or Afro- Brazilian divinities, of their members. While they outwardly met ecclesiastical and legal requirements, they become exclusive guilds that worked behind the scenes for the interests of their members. As respected organizations of solidarity, they were at the same time living expressions of inter-ethnic exchange and an ambiguous instrument of social control, whose participants were creative \\"managers\\". The confraternity always made its members contribute. One-off membership and annual fees, alms collected and other forms of income were used for a variety of purposes: purchases of freedom from slavery, festivals, religious obligations, payments for masses, charity, clothing. In the case of Boa Morte, whose members were relatively poor and almost all elderly--from 50 to 70 years old--the funds raised during members' lifetimes were always meant to pay for a decent funeral, whose preparations, given the dual religious activities of its members, required both rigor and understanding, besides being a nest-egg for the burial. Candombl√© In time the Sisterhood has lessened its connection to the Catholic Church and has become a landmark of Candombl√©, the main African-based religion of Brazil. Candombl√© is a spiritist religion, that worships a complex pantheon of deities or guardian spirits, the Orix√°s. At Candombl√© rituals, the Orix√°s are invoked and \\"incorporate\\" in the officiating priests. Due to their secret nature the inner rites of the Sisterhood, linked to the worship of the Orix√°s, have still not been the object of an ethnographic interpretation. What has been studied is the exterior part of the worship, which uses almost entirely Catholic symbols, appropriated by Afro-Brazilian religion. The high point of the Sisterhood's activities is the Festival of Our Lady of the Good Death, held every year in Cachoeira. =Origins of the Festival= The Sisterhood's Festival brings together elements of Candombl√© worship with an ancient Christian festival, the Assumption of the Virgin, whose origins are in the Orient. The festival reached Rome in the 7th century, spread through the Catholic world over the next two centuries, and was eventually brought from Portugal to Brazil, where it was known as the festival of Our Lady of August. Devotion to the Good Death was just as common in colonial and imperial Brazil as the confraternities. It has always been a popular cult. In the Church of Our Lady of Ros√°rio in Barroquinha it became stronger and more consistent. There was considerable G√™ge-Nag√¥ presence there and the celebrations described by writers like Silva Campos were similar to contemporary practices in Cachoeira. One of the most respected candombl√© centers in Bahia originated there; founded in the 18th century, the Casa Branca center in Engenho Velho da Federa√ß√£o in Salvador has been studied by Renato da Silveira. =Peculiar interpretation= The Sisterhood's version of the Festival became a popular devotion with racial features as the Sisterhood gathered mainly black and mixed-race women, and acquired a unique interpretation with its own characteristics. For that reason the group has always caused conflict with church authorities. Candombl√© lent elements of its belief system to a practice that was originally Catholic, as well as socio-historical components of the hard reality of slavery, of a captivity that made martyrs of those in the diaspora. Veneration of Our Lady of the Good Death came to have social significance as it allowed slaves to gather, maintain their religiosity in a hostile environment and shape a corporate instrument for defending and valuing of individuals. It became, for all of these reasons, an unrivaled means of celebrating life. =The Festivities= At the beginning of August a long schedule of public events brings people from everywhere to Cachoeira, to what Moraes Ribeiro considers the most representative living document of Brazilian, baroque, Ibero-African religiosity. Suppers, parades, masses, processions, samba-de-roda (a traditional form of playing and dancing the samba in a circle) put the confraternity in the center of events in this provincial city and, ultimately, in the main newspapers and news networks of the capital. The festival's calendar includes the confession of members in the parish church; a cortege representing the death of Our Lady; a vigil followed by a supper of bread, wines and seafood in obedience to religious customs forbidding the consumption of palm oil and meat on the day of Oxal√°, the creator of the universe; and the burial procession of Our Lady of the Good Death, during which the sisters wear their ceremonial clothing. The celebration of the Assumption of Our Lady of Glory by a mass in the mother church, followed by a procession, gives way to the contagious fun of the people of Cachoeira, which breaks out in full color, food, music and dancing over as many days as the donations and annual reserves allow. Hierarchy and worship Like all confraternities of Bahia, the Boa Morte has an internal hierarchy that administers the everyday devotions of its members. The leadership is made up of four sisters, responsible for organizing the public festival in August. They are replaced each year. At the top, in the most prominent position of the Irmandade da Boa Morte, is the Perpetual Judge, who is the eldest member. There follow the posts of Attorney General, Provider, Treasurer and Scribe; the first is at the head of religious and profane activities. =Novitiate= Novices must be attached to a candombl√© center in the area--usually G√™ge, Ketu or Nag√¥-Bat√°--and must profess religious syncretism. They go through an initiation that has a preparatory phase of three years during which they are known as \\"sisters of the purse\\" and their vocation is tested. Once they are accepted they can take positions of leadership and rise in the confraternity's hierarchy every three years. They all share the tasks of cooking, collecting funds, organizing ceremonial suppers, processions and the funerals of members according to religious precepts and unwritten statutory regulations. Elections are held each year. Votes are cast with grains of corn and beans; the former indicates a nay and the latter a favorable vote. As application of hierarchical differences and the rules regarding each position, all the sisters are on the same footing as servants of Our Lady. Besides being sisters in their devotion to her, they are sometimes sisters in candombl√© and are almost always \\"relatives\\"--Africans and their descendants in Brazil broadened the concept of kinship to include all those who are of the same nation. Syncretism and cultural interchange African ancestry was reworked within Bahian religious institutions and the lay confraternities end up serving this process of cultural intercourse. The belief system has absorbed the values of the dominant culture in a functional and creative way so that, in the name of life, complex processes of syncretism and cultural appropriation take place. One example is the descent of Our Lady herself to the confraternity every seven years to direct the celebrations in person through the Attorney-General and celebrate among the living the relativity of death. Other examples are found in the symbols of clothing and food, where there is constant reference to the links between this world (Aiy√™) and the other (Orun).

() Pandiatonicism is a musical technique of using the diatonic (as opposed to the chromatic) scale without the limitations of functional tonality. Music using this technique is pandiatonic. The term \\"pandiatonicism\\" was coined by Nicolas Slonimsky in the second edition of Music since 1900 to describe chord formations of any number up to all seven degrees of the diatonic scale, \\"used freely in democratic equality\\" . Triads with added notes such as the sixth, seventh, or second (added tone chords) are the most common (; ), while the, \\"most elementary form,\\" is a nonharmonic bass . According to Slonimsky's definition, > Pan-diatonicism sanctions the simultaneous use of any or all seven tones of > the diatonic scale, with the bass determining the harmony. The chord- > building remains tertian, with the seventh, ninth, or thirteenth chords > being treated as consonances functionally equivalent to the fundamental > triad. (The eleventh chord is shunned in tonic harmony because of its > quartal connotations.) Pan-diatonicism, as consolidation of tonality, is the > favorite technique of NEO-CLASSICISM . Pandiatonic music typically uses the diatonic notes freely in dissonant combinations without conventional resolutions and/or without standard chord progressions, but always with a strong sense of tonality due to the absence of chromatics. \\"Pandiatonicism possesses both tonal and modal aspects, with a distinct preference for major keys\\" . Characteristic examples include the opening of Sergei Prokofiev's Piano Concerto No. 3, Alfredo Casella's Valse diatonique, and Igor Stravinsky's Pulcinella . \\"The functional importance of the primary triads...remains undiminished in pandiatonic harmony\\" . An opposed point of view holds that pandiatonicism does not project a clear and stable tonic . Pandiatonicism is also referred to as \\"white-note music\\" , though in fact occasional accidentals may be present. Other composers who employed the technique are Maurice Ravel, Paul Hindemith, Darius Milhaud, Aaron Copland, and Roy Harris . Pandiatonicism is also employed in jazz (e.g., added sixth ninth chord) and in Henry Cowell's tone clusters.. Slonimsky later came to regard pandiatonicism as a diatonic counterpart of Arnold Schoenberg's twelve- tone technique, whereby melodies may be made up of seven different notes of the diatonic scale, and then be inverted, retrograded, or both. According to this system, \\"strict pandiatonic counterpoint\\" may use progressions of seven different notes in each voice, with no vertical duplication . The term has been criticized as one of many by which, \\"Stravinsky's music, everywhere and at once, is made to represent or encompass every conceivable technique\\" , and that has, \\"become so vague a concept that it has very little meaning or use\\" . Pandiatonic music is usually defined by what it is not, \\"by the absence of traditional elements\\" : chromatic, atonal, twelve-tone, functional, clear tonic, and/or traditional dissonance resolutions . \\"It has been applied...to diatonic music lacking harmonic consistency [or]...centricity\\" . Slonimsky himself, while making fun of the definition, quotes a professor saying pandiatonicism is, \\"C-major that sounds like hell\\" . Examples of pandiatonicism include the harmonies Aaron Copland used in his populist work, Appalachian Spring , and the minimalist music by Steve Reich, Philip Glass, and the later works of John Adams (; ).

Taking a \\"good\\" look at free radicals in the aging process. Trends In Cell Biology. 2011;21(10) 569-76. A free radical is any atom or molecule that has a single unpaired electron in an outer shell.Erbas M, Sekerci H. IMPORTANCE OF FREE RADICALS AND OCCURRING DURING FOOD PROCESSING. SERBEST RAD√èKALLER√èN ONEM√è VE GIDA √èSLEME SIRASINDA OLUSUMU. 2011;36(6) 349-56. While a few free radicals such as melanin are not chemically reactive, most biologically relevant free radicals are highly reactive. For most biological structures, free radical damage is closely associated with oxidative damage. Antioxidants are reducing agents, and limit oxidative damage to biological structures by passivating them from free radicals. Strictly speaking, the free radical theory is only concerned with free radicals such as superoxide ( O2‚àí ), but it has since been expanded to encompass oxidative damage from other reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), or peroxynitrite (OONO‚àí). Denham Harman first proposed the free radical theory of aging in the 1950s, and in the 1970s extended the idea to implicate mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species. In some model organisms, such as yeast and Drosophila, there is evidence that reducing oxidative damage can extend lifespan. However, in mice, only 1 of the 18 genetic alterations (SOD-1 deletion) that block antioxidant defences, shortened lifespan. Similarly, in roundworms (Caenorhabditis elegans), blocking the production of the naturally occurring antioxidant superoxide dismutase has recently been shown to increase lifespan. Whether reducing oxidative damage below normal levels is sufficient to extend lifespan remains an open and controversial question.  Background  The free radical theory of aging was conceived by Denham Harman in the 1950s, when prevailing scientific opinion held that free radicals were too unstable to exist in biological systems. This was also before anyone invoked free radicals as a cause of degenerative diseases. Two sources inspired Harman: 1) the rate of living theory, which holds that lifespan is an inverse function of metabolic rate which in turn is proportional to oxygen consumption, and 2) Rebbeca Gershman's observation that hyperbaric oxygen toxicity and radiation toxicity could be explained by the same underlying phenomenon: oxygen free radicals. Noting that radiation causes \\"mutation, cancer and aging\\", Harman argued that oxygen free radicals produced during normal respiration would cause cumulative damage which would eventually lead to organismal loss of functionality, and ultimately death. In later years, the free radical theory was expanded to include not only aging per se, but also age-related diseases. Free radical damage within cells has been linked to a range of disorders including cancer, arthritis, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and diabetes.Clancy D, Birdsall J. Flies, worms and the Free Radical Theory of ageing. Ageing Research Reviews. (0). There has been some evidence to suggest that free radicals and some reactive nitrogen species trigger and increase cell death mechanisms within the body such as apoptosis and in extreme cases necrosis. In 1972, Harman modified his original theory. In its current form, this theory proposes that reactive oxygen species that are produced in the mitochondria, causes damage to certain macromolecules including lipids, proteins and most importantly mitochondrial DNA. This damage then causes mutations which lead to an increase of ROS production and greatly enhance the accumulation of free radicals within cells. This mitochondrial theory has been more widely accepted that it could play a major role in contributing to the aging process. Since Harman first proposed the free radical theory of aging, there have been continual modifications and extensions to his original theory. Processes In chemistry, a free radical is any atom, molecule, or ion with an unpaired valence electron Free radicals are atoms or molecules containing unpaired electrons. Electrons normally exist in pairs in specific orbitals in atoms or molecules.Orchin M, Macomber RS, Pinhas A, Wilson RM, editors. The Vocabulary and Concepts of Organic Chemistry. 2 ed: John Wiley & Sons; 2005. Free radicals, which contain only a single electron in any orbital, are usually unstable toward losing or picking up an extra electron, so that all electrons in the atom or molecule will be paired. Note that the unpaired electron does not imply charge - free radicals can be positively charged, negatively charged, or neutral. Damage occurs when the free radical encounters another molecule and seeks to find another electron to pair its unpaired electron. The free radical often pulls an electron off a neighboring molecule, causing the affected molecule to become a free radical itself. The new free radical can then pull an electron off the next molecule, and a chemical chain reaction of radical production occurs. The free radicals produced in such reactions often terminate by removing an electron from a molecule which becomes changed or cannot function without it, especially in biology. Such an event causes damage to the molecule, and thus to the cell that contains it (since the molecule often becomes dysfunctional). The chain reaction caused by free radicals can lead to cross-linking of atomic structures. In cases where the free radical- induced chain reaction involves base pair molecules in a strand of DNA, the DNA can become cross-linked. DNA cross-linking can in turn lead to various effects of aging, especially cancer.Dizdaroglu M, Jaruga P. Mechanisms of free radical-induced damage to DNA. Free Radical Research. [Article]. 2012;46(4) 382-419. Other cross-linking can occur between fat and protein molecules, which leads to wrinkles.Pageon H, Asselineau D. An in Vitro Approach to the Chronological Aging of Skin by Glycation of the Collagen: The Biological Effect of Glycation on the Reconstructed Skin Model\\" Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences 2005;1043(1) 529-32. Free radicals can oxidize LDL, and this is a key event in the formation of plaque in arteries, leading to heart disease and stroke.Bamm VV, Tsemakhovich VA, Shaklai N. Oxidation of low- density lipoprotein by hemoglobin‚Äìhemichrome. The International Journal of Biochemistry & Cell Biology. 2003;35(3) 349-58. These are examples of how the free-radical theory of aging has been used to neatly \\"explain\\" the origin of many chronic diseases.C. Richter, JW Park, BN Ames \\"Normal oxidative damage to mitochondrial and nuclear DNA is extensive\\" \\"PNAS\\", 1988. Free radicals that are thought to be involved in the process of aging include superoxide and nitric oxide. Specifically, an increase in superoxide affects aging whereas a decrease in nitric oxide formation, or its bioavailability, does the same. Antioxidants are helpful in reducing and preventing damage from free radical reactions because of their ability to donate electrons which neutralize the radical without forming another. Ascorbic acid, for example, can lose an electron to a free radical and remain stable itself by passing its unstable electron around the antioxidant molecule.Bagchi D. et al \\"Oxygen free radical scavenging abilities of vitamins C and E, and a grape seed proanthocyanidin extract in vitro\\" \\"Research Communications in Molecular Pathology and Pharmacology\\" 1997. This has led to the hypothesis that large amounts of antioxidants,Biesalski H. Free radical theory of aging. Current Opinion in Clinical Nutrition and Metabolic Care. 2002 January 2002;5(1) 5 -10. with their ability to decrease the numbers of free radicals, might lessen the radical damage causing chronic diseases, and even radical damage responsible for aging.  Evidence  Numerous studies have demonstrated a role for free radicals in the aging process and thus tentatively support the free radical theory of aging. Studies have shown a significant increase in superoxide radical (SOR) formation and lipid peroxidation in aging rats. Chung et al. suggest ROS production increases with age and indicated the conversion of XDH to XOD may be an important contributing factor. This was supported by a study that showed superoxide production by xanthine oxidase and NO synthase in mesenteric arteries was higher in older rats than young ones. Hamilton et al. examined the similarities in impaired endothelial function in hypertension and aging in humans and found a significant overproduction of superoxide in both. This finding is supported by a 2007 study which found that endothelial oxidative stress develops with aging in healthy men and is related to reductions in endothelium-dependent dilation. Furthermore, a study using cultured smooth muscle cells displayed increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells derived from older mice. These findings were supported by a second study using Leydig cells isolated from the testes of young and old rats. The Choksi et al. experiment with Ames dwarf (DW) mice suggests the lower levels of endogenous ROS production in DW mice may be a factor in their resistance to oxidative stress and long life. Lener et al. suggest Nox4 activity increases oxidative damage in human umbilical vein endothelial cells via superoxide overproduction. Furthermore, Rodriguez-Manas et al. found endothelial dysfunction in human vessels is due to the collective effect of vascular inflammation and oxidative stress. Sasaki et al. reported superoxide-dependent chemiluminescence was inversely proportionate to maximum lifespan in mice, Wistar rats, and pigeons. They suggest ROS signalling may be a determinant in the aging process. In humans, Mendoza-Nunez et al. propose an age of 60 years or older may be linked with increased oxidative stress.Mendoza-N√∫√±ez VM, Ruiz- Ramos M, S√°nchez-Rodr√≠guez MA, Retana-Ugalde R, Mu√±oz-S√°nchez JL. Aging- related oxidative stress in healthy humans. The Tohoku Journal of Experimental Medicine. 2007;213(3) 261-8. Miyazawa found mitochondrial superoxide anion production can lead to organ atrophy and dysfunction via mitochondrial- mediated apoptosis. In addition, they suggest mitochondrial superoxide anion plays an essential part in aging.Miyazawa M, Ishii T, Yasuda K, Noda S, Onouchi H, Hartman PS, et al. Lund et al. demonstrated the role of endogenous extracellular superoxide dismutase in protecting against endothelial dysfunction during the aging process using mice.  Modifications of the free radical theory of aging  One of the main criticisms of the free radical theory of aging is directed at the suggestion that free radicals are responsible for the damage of biomolecules, thus being a major reason for cellular senescence and organismal aging. Several modifications have been proposed to integrate current research into the overall theory. = Mitochondrial theory of aging = Major sources of Reactive oxygen species in living systems Mitochondrial theory of aging was first proposed in 1978,Lobachev A.N.Lobachev A.N. and shortly thereafter the Mitochondrial free radical theory of aging was introduced in 1980.Miquel J, Economos AC, Fleming J, et al. The theory implicates the mitochondria as the chief target of radical damage, since there is a known chemical mechanism by which mitochondria can produce Reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial components such as mtDNA are not as well protected as nuclear DNA, and by studies comparing damage to nuclear and mtDNA that demonstrate higher levels of radical damage on the mitochondrial molecules. Electrons may escape from metabolic processes in the mitochondria like the Electron transport chain, and these electrons may in turn react with water to form ROS such as the superoxide radical, or via an indirect route the hydroxyl radical. These radicals then damage the mitochondria's DNA and proteins, and these damage components in turn are more liable to produce ROS byproducts. Thus a positive feedback loop of oxidative stress is established that, over time, can lead to the deterioration of cells and later organs and the entire body. This theory has been widely debated and it is still unclear how ROS induced mtDNA mutations develop. Conte et al. suggest iron-substituted zinc fingers may generate free radicals due to the zinc finger proximity to DNA and thus lead to DNA damage. Afanas'ev suggests the superoxide dismutation activity of CuZnSOD demonstrates an important link between life span and free radicals.Afanas'ev I. Signaling and Damaging Functions of Free Radicals in Aging-Free Radical Theory, Hormesis, and TOR. Aging And Disease. 2010;1(2) 75-88. The link between CuZnSOD and life span was demonstrated by Perez et al. who indicated mice life span was affected by the deletion of the Sod1 gene which encodes CuZnSOD. Contrary to the usually observed association between mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) and a decline in longevity, Yee et al. recently observed increased longevity mediated by mtROS signaling in an apoptosis pathway. This serves to support the possibility that observed correlations between ROS damage and aging are not necessarily indicative of the causal involvement of ROS in the aging process but are more likely due to their modulating signal transduction pathways that are part of cellular responses to the aging process. =Epigenetic oxidative redox shift (EORS) theory of aging= Brewer proposed a theory which integrates the free radical theory of aging with the insulin signalling effects in aging. Brewer's theory suggests \\"sedentary behaviour associated with age triggers an oxidized redox shift and impaired mitochondrial function\\". This mitochondrial impairment leads to more sedentary behaviour and accelerated aging. =Metabolic stability theory of aging= The metabolic stability theory of aging suggests it is the cells ability to maintain stable concentration of ROS which is the primary determinant of lifespan. This theory criticizes the free radical theory because it ignores that ROS are specific signalling molecules which are necessary for maintaining normal cell functions. = Mitohormesis = Oxidative stress may promote life expectancy of Caenorhabditis elegans by inducing a secondary response to initially increased levels of reactive oxygen species. In mammals, the question of the net effect of reactive oxygen species on aging is even less clear. Recent epidemiological findings support the process of mitohormesis in humans, and even suggest that the intake of exogenous antioxidants may increase disease prevalence in humans (according to the theory, because they prevent the stimulation of the organism's natural response to the oxidant compounds which not only neutralizes them but provides other benefits as well).. See also the letter to JAMA by Philip Taylor and Sanford Dawsey and the reply by the authors of the original paper. = Effects of calorie restriction = Studies have demonstrated that calorie restriction displays positive effects on the lifespan of organisms even though it is accompanied by increases in oxidative stress. Many studies suggest this may be due to anti-oxidative action, oxidative stress suppression, or oxidative stress resistanceUngvari Z, Parrado-Fernandez C, Csiszar A, de Cabo R. Mechanisms underlying caloric restriction and lifespan regulation: implications for vascular aging\\" Circulation Research 2008;102(5) 519-28. which occurs in calorie restriction. Fontana et al. suggest calorie restriction influenced numerous signal pathways through the reduction of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1).Fontana L, Partridge L, Longo VD. Extending healthy life span--from yeast to humans. Science (New York, NY). 2010;328(5976) 321-6. Additionally they suggest antioxidant SOD and catalase are involved in the inhibition of this nutrient signalling pathway. The increase in life expectancy observed during some calorie restriction studies which can occur with lack of decreases or even increases in O2 consumption is often inferred as opposing the mitochondrial free radical theory of aging.Barja G. Mitochondrial oxygen consumption and reactive oxygen species production are independently modulated: implications for aging studies. Rejuvenation Research. 2007;10(2) 215-24. However, Barja showed significant decreases in mitochondrial oxygen radical production (per unit of O2 consumed) occur during dietary restriction, aerobic exercise, chronic exercise, and hyperthyroidism. Additionally, mitochondrial oxygen radical generation is lower in long-lived birds than in short-lived mammals of comparable body size and metabolic rate. Thus, mitochondrial ROS production must be regulated independently of O2 consumption in a variety of species, tissues and physiologic states. Challenges to the free radical theory of aging =Naked Mole-rat= The naked mole-rat is a long-lived (32 years) rodent. As reviewed by Lewis et al., (2013), levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the naked mole rat are similar to that of another rodent, the relatively short-lived mouse (4 years). They concluded that it is not oxidative stress that modulates health-span and longevity in these rodents, but rather other cytoprotective mechanisms that allow animals to deal with high levels of oxidative damage and stress. In the naked mole-rat, a likely important cytoprotective mechanism that could provide longevity assurance is elevated expression of DNA repair genes involved in several key DNA repair pathways. (See DNA damage theory of aging.) Compared with the mouse, the naked mole rat had significantly higher expression levels of genes essential for the DNA repair pathways of DNA mismatch repair, non-homologous end joining and base excision repair. =Birds= Among birds, parrots live about 5-times longer than quail. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in heart, skeletal muscle, liver and intact erythrocytes was found to be similar in parrots and quail and showed no correspondence with longevity difference. These findings were concluded to cast doubt on the robustness of the oxidative stress theory of aging.

It is used to carry flowers for the burial service, or sometimes to carry the coffin under a bed of flowers. Built on the same commercial chassis as a hearse, the flower car has half- height rear bodywork on the rear similar to a pickup truck bed. The bed contains a liner to hold the flowers, normally built of stainless steel to resist rust. Some flower cars have a raised, flat tonneau cover across the bed at the top, upon which the flowers sit; the center portion sometimes is designed to raise and lower, hydraulically or by hand. If the flower car is designed to carry a casket, it will be stored under the tonneau cover in the space beneath, behind the opening rear gate. In the early years of the automobile, open-topped luxury cars were used for this purpose, but as enclosed vehicles became the norm, specially built vehicles began to be used for this purpose from approximately the 1930s onward. Not every funeral provider owned a flower car; they were a luxury item offered as an extra-cost option for extravagant funerals. The quantities built were low; it is estimated that fewer than a dozen were built each year by each coachbuilder in the funeral market. Flower cars are still manufactured, but in ever decreasing numbers.

The Salzkammergut (; Central Bavarian: ) is a resort area located in Austria, stretching from the city of Salzburg eastwards along the Alpine Foreland and the Northern Limestone Alps to the peaks of the Dachstein Mountains. The main river of the region is the Traun, a right tributary of the Danube. The name translates to 'salt demesne', being a German word for territories held by princes of the Holy Roman Empire, in early modern Austria specifically territories of the Habsburg Monarchy. The salt mines of Salzkammergut were administered by the Imperial in Gmunden from 1745 to 1850. Parts of the region were designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997.Homepage of the Permanent Delegation to UNESCO in Austria - Description Hallstatt-Dachstein / Salzkammergut Cultural Landscape Geography The lands on the shore of the Traun River comprise numerous glacial lakes and raised bogs, and the Salzkammergut Mountains and the adjacent Dachstein Mountains, the Totes Gebirge and the Upper Austrian Prealps with prominent Mt. Traunstein in the east. The towering mountain slopes are characterized by bright limestone (karst) and flysch rocks.

The historical term referred not to a region but to specific possessions (salt mines) of the Habsburg Monarchy within the region. Since 2002, however, there has been a well-defined , marketed by , a company with seat in Bad Ischl As defined by this company, Salzkammergut as a region of the tourism industry includes 58 municipalities in three Austrian states, the majority within Upper Austria (Gmunden and V√∂cklabruck districts), besides smaller portions of Styria and Salzburg. divides the Salzkammergut region into ten sub-regions, as follows: * : Bad Aussee, Styria * : Wolfgangsee, Salzburg * : Fuschlsee, Salzburg * : Hallst√§tter See, Bad Goisern, Hallstatt, Obertraun and Gosau, Upper Austria * : Traunsee, Upper Austria * : Attersee, Upper Austria * : Mondsee (town), Mondsee, Irrsee, Upper Austria * : Bad Ischl, Upper Austria * : Attergau, Upper Austria * : Almtal, Upper Austria History Archaeological findings in the area date back to the Neolithic era, especially the stilt houses of the Mondsee group culture, who settled the region from about 3800 BC onwards. The Germanic name hall of several settlements refers to the region's numerous salt mines, which had been in use at least since the days of the Celtic Hallstatt culture, centered at the mining town of Hallstatt. These operations were continued by the Romans, after the area had been incorporated into the Noricum province in 15 BC. A Roman settlement and salt evaporation pond at Hallstatt is documented about 100, affected by several Germanic invasions after the Marcomannic Wars, until the province was finally evacuated at the behest of the Italian king Odoacer in 488. From about 530, Bavarii tribes settled the region from the west, they met with Alpine Slavs who had moved northwards through the Enns Valley and across the Dachstein Mountains. From 900 salt trade is again documented along the Traun River, when the area was part of the Traungau region of the German stem duchy of Bavaria, held by the comital dynasty of the Otakars, who from 1056 also ruled over the neighbouring March of Styria. While most of the Traungau fell to the Babenberg duchy of Austria upon the deposition of the Bavarian duke Henry the Lion in 1180, the southeastern Ausseerland remained with the newly established Duchy of Styria, which nevertheless from 1192 was held in personal union by the Austrian Babenbergs. In 1278 King Rudolph I of Germany, a scion of the Swabian House of Habsburg, finally seized both duchies from King Ottokar II of Bohemia, whom he defeated in the Battle on the Marchfeld. Rudolph's son King Albert I of Germany defended his hegemony against the rivaling Prince-Archbishops of Salzburg in the west and in 1298 made the lands of Ischl a present to his wife Countess Elisabeth of Gorizia-Tyrol. Emperor Maximilian I added to the territory the estates of Mondsee Abbey in 1506. The Habsburg officials resided at Wildenstein Castle near Ischl and the surrounding estates were designated a Kammergut, as first documented in a 1656 deed. In the 17th century, Ischl and Hallstatt were considered separate Kammerg√ºter. Theodoro Tscherning, Das von den T√ºrken lang gequ√§lte ... K√∂nigreich Hungarn (1687), p. 23.- The salt mines at were immediate domains of the Habsburg King of the Romans and mining part of his princely regalia. The salt mines were administered by the financial aulic chamber at Vienna, represented by the salt chamber (Salzamt) in Gmunden, established in the 15th century. The Salzkammer in Gmunden was made Salzoberamt by a decree of empress Maria Theresia of 22 May 1745. The term Salzkammergut dates to this period, during which the Gmunden Salzoberamt was the administrative seat of all salt mines in the region,Ignaz De Luca Geogprahisches Handbuch (1791), p. 480 names Gmunden as situated on the margin of Salzkammeramt but denies the \\"erroneous assumption\\" that Gmunden is part of the Salzkammergut proper. \\"Die Stadt hat mit dem Salzkammergut nichts anders gemein, als dasz in derselben das Salzoberamt mit den dazu geh√∂rigen Aemtern, als: dem Obersalzversilberamt, Groszkussenhandelamt, Hofkastenamt, Hofbauamt, und der Salzaufsch√ºtt, gelegen ist.\\" with subordinate offices at Ischl, Ebensee am Traunsee, Stadl, Lambach, Wels, Zizlau, Enghagen, Mauthausen and Linz.Kurt Jakob Verweseramt (Lexikon-Salzwirtschaft, Stiftung Seeau) The Salz√§mter were dissolved in the 19th century. Emperor Franz Joseph I in 1850 transformed the Gmunden Salzoberamt into the k.k. Salinen- und Forstdirektion , the predecessor of the modern Salinen Austria AG (a joint-stock company since 1979, fully privatised in 1997). Economy During the time of Emperor Franz Joseph I, the Salzkammergut area was a hub of cultured life. The Emperor spent his summer holidays in Bad Ischl in the Kaiservilla, from which he governed his empire in the warmer months. This was also where he signed the declaration of war with Serbia that started World War I. There used to be a salt mining industry but it is today relatively minor contributor to the local economy. More important is the forest industry. Industrial sites include Ebensee, Gmunden, Laakirchen and Steyrerm√ºhl. The Salzkammergut also profits from its tradition of small businesses and trade companies, many of which originated due to the salt mining. The unemployment rate was approximately 4.8% in 2005, compared to an overall figure of 7.3% for Austria. A well-known narrow-gauge railway, the Salzkammergut-Lokalbahn formerly ran from Salzburg to Bad Ischl, but it closed in 1957.http://www.salzkammergut.at A standard gauge railroad continues to run through the region, as well as the Schafbergbahn rack railway in St. Wolfgang. Recreational facilities include swimming and water sports at the many lakes, mountaineering, cycling and horse riding holidays, winter sports and cultural events. The region owes its reputation as a recreational area not only to its landscape and climate but also to its many spas. It remains a major tourist area despite its age.

Revisionism differed from other types of Zionism primarily in its territorial maximalism. Revisionists had a vision of occupying the full territory, and insisted upon the Jewish right to sovereignty over the whole of Eretz Yisrael, which they equated to the whole territory covered by the League of Nations Mandate for Palestine, including Transjordan. It was the chief ideological competitor to the dominant socialist Labor Zionism. In 1935, after the Zionist Executive rejected Jabotinsky's political program and refused to state that \\"the aim of Zionism was the establishment of a Jewish state\\", Jabotinsky resigned from the World Zionist Organization. He founded the New Zionist Organization (NZO), known in Hebrew as Tzakh, to conduct independent political activity for free immigration and the establishment of a Jewish State.. In its early years under Jabotinsky's leadership, Revisionist Zionism was focused on gaining support from Britain for settlement. Later, Revisionist groups independent of Jabotinsky's direction conducted campaigns of Zionist political violence against the British to drive them out of Mandatory Palestine to establish a Jewish state. Revisionist Zionism has strongly influenced right-wing Israeli parties, principally the Herut and its successor, the Likud. History The British Mandate for Palestine included both Palestine and the Transjordan, the modern-day territories of Israel, the West Bank, Gaza and Jordan. The Mandate allowed Britain to restrict Jewish settlement everywhere in the Mandate including in Transjordan, east of the River Jordan. Revisionist Zionism was based on a vision of \\"political Zionism\\", which Jabotinsky regarded as following the legacy of Theodor Herzl, the founder of modern political Zionism. His main demand was the creation of Greater Israel on both sides of the Jordan River, and was against the partition of Palestine, such as suggested by the Peel Commission, with Arabs. The 1921 British establishment of Transjordan (the modern-day state of Jordan) adversely affected this goal, and was a great setback for the movement. Before Israel achieved statehood in 1948, Revisionist Zionism became known for its advocacy of more belligerent, assertive postures and actions against both British and Arab control of the region. Revisionism's foremost political objective was to establish and maintain the territorial integrity of the historical land of Israel; its representatives wanted to establish a Jewish state with a Jewish majority on both sides of the River Jordan. Jewish statehood was always a major ideological goal for Revisionism, but it was not to be gained at the price of partitioning Eretz Yisrael. Jabotinsky and his followers in Betar, the New Zionist Organization (NZO) and Hatzohar consistently rejected proposals to partition Palestine into an Arab state and a Jewish state. Menachem Begin, who came to embody Revisionist Zionism after the 1940 death of Jabotinsky, opposed the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine. Revisionists regarded the subsequent partition of Palestine following the 1949 Armistice Agreements as illegitimate.. During the first two decades after the Israeli Declaration of Independence in May 1948, the main revisionist party, Herut (founded in June 1948), remained in opposition. The party slowly began to revise its ideology in an effort to change this situation and to gain political power. While Begin maintained the Revisionist claim to Jewish sovereignty over all of Eretz Israel, by the late 1950s, control over the East Bank of the Jordan ceased to be integral to Revisionist ideology. Following Herut's merger with the Liberal Party in 1965, references to the ideal of Jewish sovereignty over \\"both banks of the Jordan\\" appeared less and less frequently. By the 1970s, the legitimacy of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan was no longer questioned. In 1994 the complete practical abandonment of the \\"both banks\\" principle was apparent when an overwhelming majority of Likud Knesset Members (MKs) voted in favour of the Israel‚ÄìJordan Treaty of Peace.. The day the Six-Day War started in June 1967, the Revisionists, as part of the Gahal faction, joined the national unity government under Prime Minister Levi Eshkol. Begin served in the cabinet of Israel for the first time. Ben-Gurion's Rafi party also joined.. The war brought to an end Labour Party's previous efforts to undercut Revisionism because on the eve of the war, the dominant party, Mapai, believed it had to include the Revisionist opposition in an emergency national-unity government. This action helped legitimize the views of the opposition. It also showed that the dominant party no longer felt that it could monopolize power.. This unity arrangement lasted until August 1970, when Begin and Gahal left Golda Meir's government. Some sources indicate the resignation was due to disagreements over the Rogers Plan and its \\"in-place\\" cease-fire with Egypt along the Suez Canal; other sources, including William B. Quandt, note that Begin left the unity government because the Labour Party, by formally accepting UN 242 in mid-1970, had accepted \\"peace for withdrawal\\" on all fronts. On August 5, 1970, Begin himself explained his resignation before the Knesset, saying: > \\"As far as we are concerned, what do the words 'withdrawal from territories > administered since 1967 by Israel' mean other than Judea and Samaria.[sic] > Not all the territories; but by all opinion, most of them.\\". Compare: Following Israel's capture of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Six-Day War, Revisionism's territorial aspirations concentrated on these territories. These areas were far more central to ancient Jewish history than the East Bank of the Jordan and most of the areas within Israel's post-1949 borders. In 1968 Begin defined the \\"eternal patrimony of our ancestors\\" as \\"Jerusalem, Hebron, Bethlehem, Judea, [and] Shechem [Nablus]\\" in the West Bank. In 1973 Herut's election platform called for the annexation of the West Bank and Gaza. When Menachem Begin became leader of the broad Likud coalition (1973) and soon afterwards Prime Minister (in office: 1977‚Äì1983), he considerably modified Herut's expansive territorial aims. The party's aspiration to unite all of mandatory Palestine under Jewish rule was scaled down. Instead, Begin spoke of the historic unity of Israel in the West Bank, even hinting that he would make territorial concessions in the Sinai as part of a complete peace settlement.. Ze'ev Jabotinsky, founder of Revisionist Zionism When Begin finally came to power in the 1977 election, his overriding concern as Prime Minister (1977‚Äì1983) was to maintain Israeli control over the West Bank and Gaza... In 1981 he declared to a group of Jewish settlers: \\"I, Menachem, the son of Ze'ev and Hasia Begin, do solemnly swear that as long as I serve the nation as Prime Minister we will not leave any part of Judea, Samaria, [or] the Gaza Strip.\\"; cited in Rynhold and Waxman, Ideological change and Israel's disengagement from Gaza One of the main mechanisms for accomplishing this objective was the establishment of Jewish settlements. Under Labour governments, between 1967 and 1977, the Jewish population of the territories reached 3,200 ; Labour's limited settlement activity was predicated upon making a future territorial compromise when the majority of the territory would be returned to Arab control. By contrast, the Likud's settlement plan aimed to settle 750,000 Jews all over the territories in order to prevent a territorial compromise. As a result, by 1984, there were about 44,000 settlers outside East Jerusalem. =Begin's foreign policy= In the diplomatic arena, Begin pursued his core ideological objective in a relatively pragmatic manner. He held back from annexing the West Bank and Gaza, recognizing that this was not feasible in the short term, due to international opposition. He signed the Camp David Accords (1978) with Egypt that referred to the \\"legitimate rights of the Palestinians\\" (although Begin insisted that the Hebrew version referred only to \\"the Arabs of Eretz Yisrael\\" and not to \\"Palestinians\\"). Begin also promoted the idea of autonomy for the Palestinians, albeit only a \\"personal\\" autonomy that would not give them control over any territory. But his uncompromising stance in the negotiations over Palestinian autonomy from 1979 to 1981 led to the resignations of the more moderate Moshe Dayan and Ezer Weizman, Foreign and Defense Ministers, respectively, both of whom left the Likud government. According to Weizman, the significant concessions Begin made to the Egyptians in the Camp David Accords and the Egypt‚ÄìIsrael Peace Treaty of the following year were motivated, in part, by his ideological commitment to the eventual annexation of the territories. By removing the most powerful Arab state from the conflict, reducing international (mainly American) pressure for Israeli concessions on the issue of the territories, and prolonging inconclusive talks on Palestinian autonomy, Begin was buying time for his government's settlement activities in the territories. Begin continued to vow that territory which was part of historic Eretz Israel in the West Bank and Gaza would never be returned. His adamant stand on the territory became an obstacle to extending the 1979 peace treaty. The Revisionist ideological stand concerning the territories has continued, although it has moderated somewhat and become more \\"pragmatic\\" in the years since, as discussed below. Jabotinsky and Revisionist Zionism After World War I, Jabotinsky was elected to the first legislative assembly in the Yishuv, and in 1921 he was elected to the Executive Council of the Zionist Organization (known as the World Zionist Organization after 1960). He quit the latter group in 1923, thanks mainly to differences of opinion with its chairman, Chaim Weizmann. In 1925, Jabotinsky formed the Revisionist Zionist Alliance, in the World Zionist Congress to advocate his views, which included increased cooperation with Britain on transforming the entire Mandate for Palestine territory, including Palestine itself and Transjordan, on opposite sides of the Jordan River, into a sovereign Jewish state, loyal to the British Empire. To this end, Jabotinsky advocated for mass Jewish immigration from Europe and the creation of a second Jewish Legion to guard a nascent Jewish state at inception. A staunch anglophile, Jabotinsky wished to convince Britain that a Jewish state would be in the best interest of the British Empire, perhaps even an autonomous extension of it in the Middle East. When, in 1935, the Zionist Organization failed to accept Jabotinsky's program, he and his followers seceded to form the New Zionist Organization. The NZO rejoined the ZO in 1946. The Zionist Organization was roughly composed of General Zionists, who were in the majority, followers of Jabotinsky, who came in a close second, and Labour Zionists, led by David Ben-Gurion, who comprised a minority yet had much influence where it mattered, in the Yishuv. Despite its strong representation in the Zionist Organization, Revisionist Zionism had a small presence in the Yishuv, in contrast to Labour Zionism, which was dominant among kibbutzim and workers, and hence the settlement enterprise. General Zionism was dominant among the middle class, which later aligned itself with the Revisionists. In the Jewish Diaspora, Revisionism was most established in Poland, where its base of operations was organized in various political parties and Zionist Youth groups, such as Betar. Note: Chariton and Lazar were never co-authors of Wdowi≈Ñski's memoir. Wdowi≈Ñski is considered the \\"single author.\\" By the late 1930s, Revisionist Zionism was divided into three distinct ideological streams: the \\"Centrists\\", the Irgun, and the \\"Messianists\\". Jabotinsky later argued for a need to establish a base in the Yishuv, and developed a vision to guide the Revisionist movement and the new Jewish society on the economic and social policy centered around the ideal of the Jewish middle class in Europe. Jabotinsky believed that basing the movement on a philosophy contrasting with the socialist-oriented Labour Zionists would attract the support of the General Zionists. In line with this thinking, the Revisionists transplanted into the Yishuv their own youth movement, Betar. They also set up a paramilitary group, [Irgun, a labour union, the National Labor Federation in Eretz-Israel, and their own health services. The latter were intended to counteract the increasing hegemony of Labour Zionism over community services via the Histadrut and address the refusal of the Histadrut to make its services available to Revisionist Party members. Irgun Tsvai Leumi The Irgun (short for Irgun Tsvai Leumi, Hebrew for \\"National Military Organization\\" ) had its roots initially in the Betar youth movement in Poland, which Jabotinsky founded. By the 1940s, they had transplanted many of its members from Europe and the United States to Palestine. The movement, now acting autonomously from the Hatzohar leadership in Poland, decided to organize locally, as its small membership was increasingly overshadowed by Labour Zionists, who were predominantly focused on settling the land. While Jabotinsky continued to lobby the British Empire, the Irgun, under the leadership of people such as David Raziel and later Menachem Begin, fought politically against the Labour Zionists and militarily against the British for the establishment of a Jewish state, independent of any orders from Jabotinsky. Acting often in conflict (but at times, also in coordination) with rival clandestine militias such as the Haganah and the Lehi (or Stern Group), the Irgun's efforts would feature prominently in the armed struggles against British and Arab forces alike in the 1930s and 1940s, and ultimately become decisive in the closing events of the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. After 1948, members of the Irgun were variously demobilised, or incorporated directly into the nascent Israeli Defense Forces; and on the political front, Irgunist ideology found a new vehicle of expression in the Herut (or \\"Freedom\\") Party. Lehi Flag of the Lehi movement. German covering letter attached to the January 1941 offer by Lehi. The offer was to \\"actively take part in the war on Germany's side\\" in return for German support for \\"the establishment of the historic Jewish state on a national and totalitarian basis\\". The movement called Lehi and nicknamed the \\"Stern Gang\\" by the British, was led by Avraham \\"Yair\\" Stern, until his death. Stern did not join the Revisionist Zionist party in university but instead joined another group called Hulda. He formed Lehi in 1940 as an offshoot from Irgun, which was initially named Irgun Zvai Leumi be-Yisrael (National Military Organization in Israel or NMO). Following Stern's death in 1942‚Äîshot by a British police officer‚Äîand the arrest of many of its members, the group went into eclipse until it was reformed as \\"Lehi\\" under a triumvirate of Israel Eldad, Natan Yellin-Mor, and Yitzhak Shamir. Lehi was guided also by spiritual leader Uri Zvi Greenberg. The Lehi, in particular their members in prison, were encouraged in their struggle by Rabbi Aryeh Levin, a greatly respected Jewish sage of the time. Shamir became the Prime Minister of Israel forty years later. Irgun‚Äîand, to a lesser extent, Lehi‚Äîwere influenced by the romantic nationalism of Italian nationalist Giuseppe Garibaldi. The movement's activities were independent of any diaspora leadership, but were backed by several figures in the diaspora. While the Irgun stopped its activities against the British during World War II, at least until 1944, Lehi continued guerrilla warfare against the British authorities. It considered the British rule of Mandatory Palestine to be an illegal occupation, and concentrated its attacks mainly against British targets (unlike the other underground movements, which were also involved in fighting against Arab paramilitary groups). In 1940, Lehi proposed intervening in the Second World War on the side of Nazi Germany to attain their help in expelling Britain from Mandate Palestine and to offer their assistance in \\"evacuating\\" the Jews of Europe. Late in 1940, Lehi representative Naftali Lubenchik was sent to Beirut where he met the German official Werner Otto von Hentig (see Lehi (group)#Contact with Nazi Germany). Lehi prisoners captured by the British generally refused to present a defence when brought to trial in British courts. They would only read out statements in which they declared that the court, representing an occupying force, had no jurisdiction over them. For the same reason, Lehi prisoners refused to plead for amnesty, even when it was clear that this would have spared them from the death penalty. In two cases, Lehi men killed themselves in prison to deprive the British of the ability to hang them. Tensions between the Irgun and Lehi simmered until the two groups forged an alliance during the 1947‚Äì1949 Palestine war.  Ideology  Ideologically, Revisionism advocated the creation of a Jewish state on both sides of the Jordan River, that is, a state which would include the present- day Israel, as well as West Bank, Gaza and all or part of the modern state of Jordan. Nevertheless, the terms of the Mandate allowed the mandatory authority, Britain, to restrict Jewish settlement in parts of the mandate territory. In 1922, before the Mandate officially came into effect in 1923, Transjordan was excluded from the terms regarding Jewish settlement. In the Churchill White Paper of 1922, the British Government had made clear that the intent expressed by the Balfour Declaration was that a Jewish National Home should be created 'in' Palestine, not that the whole of Palestine would become a Jewish National Home. All three Revisionist streams, including Centrists who advocated a British-style liberal democracy, and the two more militant streams, which would become Irgun and Lehi, supported Jewish settlement on both sides of the Jordan River; in most cases, they differed only on how this should be achieved. (Some supporters within Labor Zionism, such as Mapai's Ben-Gurion also accepted this interpretation for the Jewish homeland.) Jabotinsky wanted to gain the help of Britain in this endeavour, while Lehi and the Irgun, following Jabotinsky's death, wanted to conquer both sides of the river independently of the British. The Irgun stream of Revisionism opposed power-sharing with Arabs. In 1937, Jabotinsky rejected the conclusion of the Peel Commission, which proposed a partition of Palestine between Jews and Arabs; it was however accepted by the Labor Zionists. On the topic of \\"transfer\\" (expulsion of the Arabs), Jabotinsky's statements were ambiguous. In some writings he supported the notion, but only as an act of self-defense, in others he argued that Arabs should be included in the liberal democratic society that he was advocating, and in others still, he completely disregarded the potency of Arab resistance to Jewish settlement, and stated that settlement should continue, and the Arabs be ignored. =Fascist views within the movement= Up to 1933, a small portion of members from the national- messianist wing of Revisionism were inspired by the fascist movement of Benito Mussolini. Abba Ahimeir was attracted to fascism for its staunch anti- communism and its focus on rebuilding the glory of the past, which national- messianists such as Uri Zvi Greenberg felt had much connection to their view of what the Revisionist movement should be. Abba Ahimeir's ideology was based in Oswald Spengler's monumental study on the decline of the West, but his Zionist orientation caused him to adapt its ultimate conclusions. Achimeir's basic assumption was that liberal bourgeois European culture was degenerate, and deeply eroded from within by an excess of liberalism and individualism. Socialism and communism were portrayed as \\"overcivilized\\" ideologies. Fascism on the other hand, like Zionism, was a return to the roots of the national culture and the historical past. According to Achimeir, Italian Fascism was not anti-Semitic or anti-Zionist, whereas communist ideology and praxis were intrinsically so. He also developed a favourable attitude toward fascist praxis and its psycho-politics, such as the principle of the all-powerful leader, the use of propaganda to generate a spirit of heroism and duty to the homeland, and the cultivation of youthful vitality (as manifested in the fascist youth movements). Ahimeir joined the Revisionist movement in 1930, but before joining he wrote a regular column entitled \\"From the Notebook of a Fascist\\" in the unaffiliated but pro-Revisionist magazine Doar Hayom. He crafted his pro-fascistic views in these columns, and also wrote an article in 1928 titled \\"On the Arrival of Our Duce\\" to celebrate Jabotinsky's visit to Palestine, and propose a new direction for the Revisionist movement, more in line with Achimeir's views.. When Ahimeir was on trial in 1932 for having disrupted a public lecture at Hebrew University, his lawyer, Zvi Eliahu Cohen, argued \\"Were it not for Hitler's anti-Semitism, we would not oppose his ideology. Hitler saved Germany.\\" Tom Segev has remarked, \\"This was not an unconsidered outburst.\\" An editorial in the Revisionist newspaper Hazit Haam praised Cohen's \\"brilliant speech.\\" It continued, that \\"Social Democrats of all stripes believe that Hitler's movement is an empty shell (but) we believe that there is both a shell and a kernel. The anti-Semitic shell is to be discarded, but not the anti-Marxist kernel. The Revisionists would fight the Nazis only to the extent that they were anti-Semites.\\" In 1933, when Hitler came to power, the newspaper, whose editors were Revisionist Party members, praised Nazism as a German national liberation movement and said that Hitler had saved Germany from Communism. Jabotinsky responded by threatening to have the newspaper's editors expelled if they repeated such \\"kow-towing\\" to Hitler.. However, this did not categorize the view's of most Revisionist Zionists. =Irgun to Likud= The Irgun largely followed the Centrists' ideals but with a much more hawkish outlook toward Britain's involvement in the Mandate, and an ardently nationalist vision of society and government. After the establishment of the State of Israel, it was the Irgun wing of the Revisionist Party that formed Herut, which in turn eventually formed the Gahal party when the Herut and Liberal parties formed a united list called Gush Herut Liberalim (or the Herut-Liberal Bloc). In 1973 the new Likud Party was formed by a group of parties dominated by the Revisionist Herut/Gahal. After the 1977 Knesset elections it became the dominant party in a governing coalition, and remains an important force in Israeli politics until today. In the 2006 elections, the Likud lost many of its seats to the Kadima party. The Likud bounced back in Israel's 2009 Knesset elections, garnering 27 seats, although still less than Kadima's 28 seats. In spite of this right-of-center parties who favored a Likud-led coalition, comprised the majority; Likud was chosen to form the coalition. The party re-emerged as the strongest party in the Knesset in the 2013 elections and leads the government today. In the years since the 1977 election, particularly in the last decade, Likud has undergone a number of splits to its right, including the 1998 departure of Benny Begin, son of Herut founder Menachem Begin (he rejoined Likud in 2008), and in 2005 experienced a split to its left with the departure of Ariel Sharon and his followers to form Kadima. While the initial core group of Likud leaders such as Israeli Prime Ministers Begin and Yitzhak Shamir came from Likud's Herut faction, later leaders, such as Benjamin Netanyahu (whose father was Jabotinsky's secretary) and Ariel Sharon, have come from or moved to the \\"pragmatic\\" Revisionist wing.

Overburden is distinct from tailings, the material that remains after economically valuable components have been extracted from the generally finely milled ore. Overburden is removed during surface mining, but is typically not contaminated with toxic components. Overburden may also be used to restore an exhausted mining site to a semblance of its appearance before mining began.Kogel, Jessica Elzea (editor) (2006) Industrial minerals & rocks: commodities, markets, and uses (7th edition) Society for Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration (U.S.), Littleton, Colorado, page 379, Interburden is material that lies between two areas of economic interest, such as the material separating coal seams within strata.United States Bureau of Mines (1980) Selective Interburden Handling Techniques National Technical Information Service, Springfield, Virginia, Peng, Syd S. (1986) Coal Mine Ground Control (2nd edition), Wiley, New York, page 303, Analogous uses Overburden is also used for all soil and ancillary material above the bedrock horizon in a given area. By analogy, overburden is also used to describe the soil and other material that lies above a specific geologic feature, such as a buried astrobleme, or above an unexcavated site of archeological interest. In particle physics, the overburden of an underground laboratory may be important to shield the facility from cosmic radiation that can interfere with experiments. In arboriculture, the word is also used for the soil over the top of the roots of a tree collected from the wild.

The species has been introduced to many parts of the world and feral populations have become established. This species was formerly included in the genus Streptopelia with other turtle- doves, but studies suggest that they differ from typical members of that genus. This dove is long tailed buff brown with a white-spotted black collar patch on the back and sides of the neck. The tail tips are white and the wing coverts have light buff spots. There are considerable plumage variations across populations within its wide range. The species is found in light forests and gardens as well as in urban areas. They fly from the ground with an explosive flutter and will sometimes glide down to a perch. It is also called the mountain dove, pearl-necked dove, lace-necked dove, and spotted turtle-dove. Taxonomy S. c. chinensis (Hong Kong) The spotted dove was formally described in 1786 by the Austrian naturalist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli and given the binomial name Columba chinensis. This species was formerly included in the genus Streptopelia. A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2001 found the genus was paraphyletic with respect to Columba. To create monophyletic genera the spotted dove as well as the closely related laughing dove were moved to the resurrected genus Spilopelia that had been introduced by the Swedish zoologist Carl Sundevall in 1873. Sundevall had designated Columba tigrina as the type species, a taxon that is now considered a subspecies of the spotted dove. Although the title page in dated 1872, the part containing pages 100 and 186 was published in 1873. Several subspecies have been proposed for the plumage and size variation seen in different geographic populations. The nominate form is from China (Canton), which is also the origin of the introduced population in Hawaii. Subspecies formosa from Taiwan has been considered as doubtful and indistinguishable from the nominate population. The population in India suratensis (type locality Surat) and ceylonensis from Sri Lanka have fine rufous or buff spots on the back. There is a size reduction trend with specimens from southern India being smaller, and ceylonensis may merely be a part of this cline. The lesser and median wing-coverts are also spotted at the tip in buff. This spotting is lacking on populations further north and east of India, such as tigrina, which also differ greatly in vocalizations from the Indian forms. The population from Hainan Island is placed in hainana. Others like vacillans (=chinensis) and forresti (= tigrina) and edwardi (from Chabua = suratensis) have been considered invalid. Five subspecies are recognised: * S. c. suratensis (Gmelin, JF, 1789) ‚Äì Pakistan, India, Nepal and Bhutan * S. c. ceylonensis (Reichenbach, 1851) ‚Äì Sri Lanka (has shorter wings than suratensis) * S. c. tigrina (Temminck, 1809) ‚Äì Bangladesh and northeast India through Indochina to Philippines and the Sunda Islands * S. c. chinensis (Scopoli, 1786) ‚Äì northeast Myanmar to central and east China, Taiwan * S. c. hainana (Hartert, 1910) ‚Äì Hainan (off southeast China) The subspecies S. c. suratensis and S. c. ceylonensis differ significantly from the other subspecies in both plumage and vocalization. This has led some ornithologists to treat S. c. suratensis as a separate species, the western spotted dove. Description The bifid neck feathers The ground colour of this long and slim dove is rosy buff below shading into grey on the head and belly. There is a half collar on the back and sides of the neck made of black feathers that bifurcate and have white spots at the two tips. The median coverts have brown feathers tipped with rufous spots in the Indian and Sri Lankan subspecies which are divided at the tip by a widening grey shaft streak. The wing feathers are dark brown with grey edges. The centre of the abdomen and vent are white. The outer tail feathers are tipped in white and become visible when the bird takes off. Sexes are similar, but juveniles are duller than adults and do not acquire the neck spots until they are mature. The length ranges from 28 to 32 centimetres (11.2 to 12.8 inches). Abnormal plumages such as leucism can sometimes occur in the wild. Streptopelia chinensis-flying.jpgFlying over Bang Pa-In Palace, Thailand Distribution and habitat The spotted dove in its native range in Asia is found across a range of habitats including woodland, scrub, farmland and habitation. In India it tends to be found in the moister regions, with the laughing dove (S. senegalensis) being commoner in the drier areas. These doves are mostly found on the ground where they forage for seeds and grain or on low vegetation. The species has become established in many areas outside its native range. These areas include Hawaii, southern California, Mauritius,Roger Safford and Frank Hawkins, \\"The Birds of Africa: Volume VIII: The Malagasy Region: Madagascar, Seychelles, Comoros, Mascarenes\\", A&C; Black, 2013. Australia and New Zealand.Barrie Heather and Hugh Robertson, \\"The Field Guide to the Birds of New Zealand\\", Viking, 1996. In Australia, they were introduced in Melbourne in the 1860s and has since spread, often replacing native doves. They are now found in streets, parks, gardens, agricultural areas and tropical scrubs in diverse locations in southern and eastern Australia from Eyre Peninsula in South Australia to Cape York in Queensland. The original populations appear to be chinensis and tigrina in varying proportions. Behaviour and ecology S. c. suratensis with a hatchling and egg at nest Spotted doves move around in pairs or small groups as they forage on the ground for grass seeds, grains, fallen fruits and seeds of other plants. They may however take insects occasionally and have been recorded feeding on winged termites. The flight is quick with regular beats and an occasional sharp flick of the wings. A display flight involves taking off at a steep angle with a loud clapping of the wing and then slowly gliding down with the tail spread out. The breeding season is spread out in warm regions but tends to be in summer in the temperate ranges. In Hawaii, they breed all year round, as do all three other introduced species of doves. Males coo, bow and make aerial displays in courtship. In southern Australia, they breed mostly from September to January, and in the north in autumn. They nest mainly in low vegetation, building a flimsy cup of twigs in which two whitish eggs are laid. Nests are sometimes placed on the ground or on buildings and other structures. Both parents take part in building the nest, incubating and feeding the young. The eggs hatch after about 13 days and fledge after a fortnight. More than one brood may be raised. The vocalizations of the spotted dove include cooing softly with a Krookruk-krukroo... kroo kroo kroo with the number of terminal kroos varying in the Indian population and absent in tigrina, chinensis and other populations to the east. The species has been extending its range in many parts of the world. Populations may sometimes rise and fall rapidly, within a span of about five years. In the Philippines, the species may be outcompeting Streptopelia bitorquata. Their habit of flushing into the air when disturbed makes them a hazard on airfields, often colliding with aircraft and sometimes causing damage.

Word clock is so named because it clocks each audio sample. Samples are represented in data words. S/PDIF, AES/EBU, ADAT, and TDIF are some of the formats that use a word clock. Various audio over Ethernet systems use communication protocols to distribute word clock. The device which generates the word clock is the only master clock source for all the slave audio devices. Comparison to timecode Word clock should not be confused with timecode; word clock is used entirely to keep a perfectly timed and constant bitrate to avoid timing errors that can cause data transmission errors. Timecode is metadata about the media data being transmitted. Time code can be used as an initial phase reference for jam sync using the word clock as the frequency reference. Over coax cable Professional digital audio equipment may have a word clock input or output to synchronize timing between multiple devices. Although the electrical characteristics of the word clock signal have not been completely standardized, some characteristics should always apply. Items that should remain consistent are TTL level, a 75ohm output impedance, 75ohm cables and a 75ohm terminating resistor at the end of a chain or cable. Proper termination of the word clock signal with a 75ohm resistor is important. It prevents the clock signal from reflecting back into the cable and causing false detection of extra 1's and 0's. Some digital equipment includes a switchable terminator, some include a hardwired terminator and others have no terminator at all. The unfortunate part is that some equipment manuals do not indicate whether a hardwired terminator is included or not.Section 9.1.3 of Ardour manual The chain connection from the source (master) to the receivers (slaves) may increase jitter. Using clock distributing devices for parallel transmission is a better way. The length and quality of coaxial cables are important. Over AES3 The AES11 standard defines a means for carrying a word clock over an AES3 connection. In this context, the word clock is known as a Digital Audio Reference Signal (DARS). In annex B, the AES11 standard also describes common practice in transmitting and receiving a plain word clock signal. This is not an attempt to standardize it, the annex is informative only.

Overview Tokelau allows any individual to register domain names. Users and small businesses may register any number of domain names free of charge (with some restrictions). In addition to the name itself, users can opt to forward their web traffic using HTML frames and their email traffic, with a maximum of 250 addresses per user log in, or use full DNS, either via their own or third-party servers, or by using Dot TK's servers. There are content restrictions for free domains, banning sites containing sexual content, drug use, hate speech, firearms, and spam or copyright infringement. Dot TK requires free domains to have a regular traffic of visitors, and if a domain's redirect target does not work (even temporarily) the domain is taken offline. If a domain violates any of these terms, it is replaced by a Sedo advertisement page, and no advance warning is given. Dot TK also provides .tk websites with the option to join a network called TiKinet, a close-knit network that links sites to each other based on keywords called TiKilinks. The network is expected to increase traffic to the websites, many of which are personal sites and blogs operated by individuals who otherwise would have no way to advertise their sites. To be able to get a \\"special\\" .tk domain name the user must buy it. This includes trademark domain names for most Fortune 500 companies and common dictionary terms. Paid domain names cost US$19.90 for the first two years. Potentially valuable names with fewer than 4 characters are similarly unavailable for free registration, and must generally be purchased at a premium price of over $1000. Dot TK launched a new service called TweaK for Twitter users in April 2010, offering a URL shortening service that uses less space than many others, and for Facebook where the user can rename Facebook account pages with a .tk name. This has since been replaced by Random Domains, from Freenom. In 2016, Nominet released a world map where each country was resized according to the popularity of its top-level domain. The .tk domain ranked first worldwide with 31,311,498 registered domain names (China (.cn) ranked 2nd with 16,810,737 registered domain names). The revenues from the .tk top-level domain business represent about 1/6 of the island's annual income. Abuse In 2006, McAfee conducted a survey in which they claim out of the 95 percent most trafficked web sites, .tk domains were twice as likely as the global average to be used for \\"unwanted behaviours\\", including scams such as phishing and spam. However, in 2008 McAfee reported that the threat of scams like phishing and spam was significantly reduced with .tk and that other top level domains such as .com and .net were much more used in such scams. A 2011 report by the Anti Phishing Working Group blamed Tokelau's bad reputation on the registry Dot TK. It acquired the right to operate the top level domain and is responsible for the current free registration system. .tk domains logged 2533 of 11768 (~21.5%) total phishing attacks in the second half of 2010 Internet-wide.

It was first registered in July 1985, seven months after the original generic top-level domains such as .com and the first country code after .us. , it is the fifth most popular top-level domain worldwide (after .com, .cn, .de and .net), with over 10 million registrations. .uk has used OpenDNSSEC since March 2010. History In October 1984, RFC 920 set out the creation of ccTLDs using country codes derived from the corresponding two-letter code in the ISO 3166-1 list. \\"GB\\" is the UK's ISO 3166 country code. However, the UK academic network Name Registration Scheme, JANET NRS, had defined \\"UK\\" as the top-level domain a few months before the compilation of the ISO-derived list. Consequently, . uk was chosen and registered on 24 July 1985. .gb was reserved but never widely used and it is no longer possible to register domains under that ccTLD. As with other ccTLDs in the early days it was originally delegated by Jon Postel to a \\"trusted person\\" to manage. Andrew McDowell at UCL was assigned .uk, the first country code delegation. In time, he passed it to Willie Black at the UK Education and Research Networking Association (UKERNA). Originally, domain requests were emailed, manually screened by and then forwarded to the UK Naming Committee before being processed by UKERNA. Membership of this committee was restricted to a group of high-end ISPs who were part of a formal peering arrangement. The Naming Committee was organised as a mailing list to which all proposed names were circulated. The members would consider the proposals under a ruleset that insisted that all domain names should be very close if not identical to a registered business name of the registrant. Members of the Naming Committee could object to any name, and if at least a small number of objections were received, the name was refused. By the mid-1990s the growth of the Internet, and particularly the advent of the World Wide Web was pushing requests for domain name registrations up to levels that were not manageable by a group of part-time voluntary managers. Oliver Smith of Demon Internet forced the issue by providing the committee with a series of automated tools, called the \\"automaton\\", which formalised and automated the naming process end to end. This allowed many more registrations to be processed far more reliably and rapidly, and inspired individuals such as Ivan Pope to explore more entrepreneurial approaches to registration. Various plans were put forward for the possible management of the domain, mostly Internet service providers seeking to stake a claim, each of which were naturally unacceptable to the rest of the committee. In response to this Black, as the .uk Name, stepped up with a bold proposal for a not-for-profit commercial entity to deal with the .uk domain properly. Commercial interests initially balked at this, but with widespread support Nominet UK was formed in 1996 to be the .uk Network Information Centre, a role which it continues to this day. The general form of the rules (i.e. which domains can be registered and whether to allow second level domains) was set by the Naming Committee. Nominet has not made major changes to the rules, although it has introduced a new second level domain .me.uk for individuals. Until 10 June 2014 it was not possible to register a domain name directly under .uk (such as internet.uk); it was only possible as a third-level domain (such as internet.co.uk). However, some domains delegated before the creation of Nominet UK were in existence even before 10 June 2014, for example mod.uk (Ministry of Defence), parliament.uk (Parliament), bl.uk and british-library.uk (the British Library), nls.uk (the National Library of Scotland), nhs.uk (The National Health Service), and jet.uk (UKAEA as operator of the Joint European Torus experimental fusion tokamak). Currently the rights to the .uk domain name are owned by Nominet UK. It is possible to directly register a domain name with Nominet UK, but it is faster and cheaper to do it via a Nominet-accredited domain registrar. .uk right of registration New registrations directly under .uk have been accepted by Nominet since 10 June 2014 08:00 BST, however there was a reservation period for existing customers who already had a .co.uk, .org.uk, .me.uk, .net.uk, .ltd.uk or .plc.uk domain to claim the corresponding .uk domain, which ran until 06:00 BST on 25 June 2019. If a domain was registered before 23:59 UTC on 28 October 2013 the user had the rights to the equivalent .uk domain (providing there was no other corresponding .co.uk, .org.uk, me.uk, .ltd.uk, .plc.uk or .net.uk registered). For example, if 'your-company.co.uk' was held since 2 October 2013, the registrant of 'your-company.co.uk' had the reserved right of registering 'your-company.uk', up until 06:00 BST on 25 June 2019. 123-reg and NamesCo both created such domains for their customers for free but then began demanding payment in September 2019. Second-level domains =Active= * .ac.uk - academic (tertiary education, further education colleges, research establishments (such as the British Antarctic Survey) and learned societies) * .co.uk - commercial entities and purposes * .gov.uk - government (central, devolved and local) *.ltd.uk - limited companies * .me.uk - personal names * .mod.uk and .mil.uk - armed forces and Ministry of Defence establishments and systems * .net.uk - ISPs and network companies (unlike .net, use is restricted to these users) *.nhs.uk - NHS organisations and trusts *.nic.uk - network use only (Nominet UK) * .org.uk - not-for-profit entities *.parliament.uk - Parliament of the United Kingdom and the devolved national parliaments and assemblies * .plc.uk - public limited companies *.police.uk ‚Äì police forces in the UK and law enforcement organisations. *.sch.uk - local education authorities, schools, primary and secondary education, community education .co.uk, .ltd.uk, .me.uk, .net.uk, .nic.uk, .org.uk, .plc.uk and .sch.uk are managed by Nominet UK and except for .nic.uk are available for registration by the public (though they all carry various degrees of restrictions). Other second-level domains are managed by various government agencies, and generally more strongly controlled. =Inactive= * .govt.uk - former government domain, now deleted and replaced by .gov.uk * .orgn.uk - former non-profit organisations domain, now deleted and replaced by .org.uk * .lea.uk - local education authorities; since fallen out of use. * .mil.uk - the Ministry of Defence have always used .mod.uk for their external domain, but use .mil.uk on their private network. .mil.uk exists only as a CNAME for .mod.uk in the .uk zone file. =Rejected= * .cym.uk - A second-level domain for Wales; it did not have support of the Welsh Internet community, with a .cym domain being proposed, though later rejected. Top-level domains of .cymru and .wales have since been delegated to the root in 2014. * .scot.uk - A second level domain for Scotland; it was rejected by Nominet. A top-level domain of .scot has since been delegated to the root in 2014. * .sco.uk - A second level domain for Scotland. * .soc.uk - proposed for Social and Society use. Allocation of domain names Allocations are on a strict first-come, first-served basis to qualified applicants. There are no territorial restrictions: applicants need not have any connection to the UK other than those outlined below for .ltd.uk and other restricted domains. .co.uk is by far the most used of the domains, followed by .org.uk then .me.uk. .plc.uk and .ltd.uk are only rarely used. The number of new registrations for each of the different .uk domains on a month by month basis can be seen on the Nominet UK website.www.nominet.org.uk/intelligence/statistics/registration/ The intended restriction of .co.uk to companies is purely nominal; in practice it is open to any and all applicants. Likewise, whilst .org.uk is for organisations, there are no restrictions on registering domains. While .me.uk originally had no restrictions on registrants it has since been tightened up to require registrants to be natural persons (i.e. not companies, etc.). However, registrants in .ltd.uk must be, and remain, private limited companies incorporated under the UK Companies Acts. In addition, names can only be registered if they correspond (in accordance with the algorithm in the rules of registration) with the exact company name, as recorded at the companies registry at Companies House. The same conditions apply for public limited companies which wish to use a .plc.uk domain name. Neither of these domains is widely used. .net.uk is more open, but the Nominet regulations still mean that a registrant must be an ISP, or a similar body, and that the domain is not used for providing services to end-users. .nic.uk, however, is limited solely to domains operated by Nominet. .ac.uk domains are intended for the use of higher education institutions and further education colleges, and are also used by some academic support bodies such as the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service public research establishments, and learned societies such as the Royal Society. Primary and secondary education uses .sch.uk. sch.uk Unusually, .sch.uk domains are allocated at the fourth level, with the third level being taken up by the name of the local authority (LA, previously LEA or local education authority) e.g. schoolname.leaname.sch.uk.

In medieval practice of hocket, a single melody is shared between two (or occasionally more) voices such that alternately one voice sounds while the other rests. History In European music, hocket or hoquet was used primarily in vocal and choral music of the 13th and early 14th centuries. It was a predominant characteristic of music of the Notre Dame school, during the ars antiqua, in which it was found in sacred vocal music and string compositions. In the 14th century, this compositional device was most often found in secular vocal music. Although the term is in reference to this secular music of the 13th and 14th centuries in France, the technique under other names could be heard in different types of music across the world as early as the 11th century. As alternating or trading melodies between instruments had well been developed earlier in time to eventually influence the medieval usage of the technique. In seculum Example of hocket (In seculum d'Amiens longum), French, late 13th century. Observe the quick alternation of sung notes and rests between the upper two voices. While this example is textless, the hocket was usually done on a vowel sound. The term originated in reference to medieval French motets, though the technique remains in common use in contemporary music (Louis Andriessen's Hoketus), popular music (funk, stereo panning, the work of Robert Fripp and Adrian Belew in King Crimson), Indonesian gamelan music (interlocking patterns shared between two instruments‚Äîcalled imbal in Java and kotekan in Bali), Andean siku music (two panpipe sets sharing the full number of pitches), Ukrainian and Russian kuvytsi (panpipe) ensembles, Lithuanian skuduƒçiai (panpipe) ensembles, handbell music (tunes being distributed between two or more players), rara street processions in Haiti, as well as in the gaga in the Dominican Republic and many African cultures such as the Ba-Benz√©l√© (featured on Herbie Hancock's \\"Watermelon Man,\\" see Pygmy music), Mbuti, Basarwa (Khoisan), the Gumuz tribe from the Blue Nile Province (Sudan), and Gogo (Tanzania). It is also evident in drum and bugle corps drumline music, colloquially known as \\"split parts\\" or simply \\"splits\\". The use of hocketing is in reference to a broken melody line between two or more instruments or vocals, many contemporary artists freely integrate hocketing techniques with other composition devices such as alternating melodies, trading multiple melodic sections, or translating them between instruments or switching intervals of melody, or composing interlocking melodies shared between instruments. Hocket technique typically implied sharing a vocal on the vowels or having a sequence of notes spliced between instruments or vocals with certain notes in the melody being the moments of exchange. Interlocking notes are not a phenomenon in music unique to hocketing, alternating melody techniques have many uses through composition such as enabling certain vocals or instruments to become more audible than others, or effectively combining into a sequential chord, or by splitting the vocals or instruments between audio sources. While hoquet is an antiquated term and in contemporary practice is usually used alongside other melodic compositional devices and experimentation, it has found use in funk, and stereo panning, among other modern techniques typically used in similar style, and in multiple track recordings is often used artificially while editing arrangements of the song. The group Dirty Projectors have used hocketing and other antiquated techniques prominently as an element of their music, experimenting with instruments as well as vocals in the style of hocketing or melodic intervals, particularly with interlocking or alternating melodies, though not all these techniques are explicitly the \\"hoquet\\" method. The group's frontman Dave Longstreth has expressed his interest and surprise in the medieval origins of the experimental techniques in use by the band. Etymology The term comes from the French word hoquet (in Old French also hocquet, hoket, or ocquet) meaning \\"a shock, sudden interruption, hitch, hiccup,\\"The Oxford English Dictionary defines Hocket thus: ‚Äú(in medieval music) an interruption of a voice-part (usually of two or more parts alternately) by rests, so as to produce a broken or spasmodic effect; used as a contrapuntal device.‚Äù and similar onomatopeic words in Celtic, Breton, Dutch and other languages. The words were Latinized as hoquetus, (h)oketus, and (h)ochetus. Earlier etymologies tried to show derivation from Arabic, but they are no longer favored.

In Balinese music you can also hear metallophones, gongs and xylophones. Characteristics Balinese gamelan Balinese musicians. More than 50 people must be dancing during the music. Balinese music can be compared to Javanese music, especially that of the pre-Islamic period. During that time, Javanese tonal systems were imported to Bali. Balinese gamelan, a form of Indonesian classical music, is louder, swifter and more aggressive than Javanese music. Balinese gamelan also features more archaic instrumentation than modern Javanese gamelans. Balinese instruments include bronze and bamboo xylophones. Gongs and a number of gong chimes, are used, such as the solo instrument trompong, and a variety of percussion instruments like cymbals, bells, drums and the anklung (a bamboo rattle). There are two sizes of bamboo flutes, both used in theatrical music, and a rebab (two-stringed spike fiddle). Modern forms of Balinese gamelan include kebyar, an energetic style played by clubs, which generally compose their own music.

It was built to supply irrigation water to the lands near Mission San Francisco de la Espada, today part of San Antonio Missions National Historical Park. The acequia is still in use today and is an Historic Civil Engineering Landmark and a National Historic Landmark. Irrigation system Mission Espada's acequia (irrigation) system can still be seen today. The main ditch, or acequia madre, continues to carry water to the mission and its former farmlands. This water is still used by residents living on these neighboring lands. The initial survival of a new mission depended upon the planting and harvesting of crops. In south central Texas, intermittent rainfall and the need for a reliable water source made the design and installation of an acequia system a high priority. Irrigation was so important to Spanish colonial settlers that they measured cropland in suertes -the amount of land that could be watered in one day. The use of acequias was originally brought to the arid regions of Spain by the Romans and the Moors. When Franciscan missionaries arrived in the desert Southwest they found the system worked well in the hot, dry environment. In some areas, like New Mexico, it blended in easily with the irrigation system already in use by the Puebloan Native Americans. In order to distribute water to the missions along the San Antonio River, Franciscan missionaries oversaw the construction of seven gravity-flow ditches, dams, and at least one aqueduct‚Äîa network that irrigated approximately of land. The acequia not only conducted potable water and irrigation, but also powered a mill. Mission Espada has survived from its beginnings to the present day as a community center that still supports a Catholic parish and religious education, however a school originally opened by the Sisters of the Incarnate Word and Blessed Sacrament was closed in 1967.

Clinical neuropsychologists use this knowledge in the assessment, diagnosis, treatment, and or rehabilitation of patients across the lifespan with neurological, medical, neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions, as well as other cognitive and learning disorders. The branch of neuropsychology associated with children and young people is pediatric neuropsychology. Clinical neuropsychology is a specialized form of clinical psychology. Strict rules are in place to maintain evidence as a focal point of treatment and research within clinical neuropsychology. The assessment and rehabilitation of neuropsychopathologies is the focus for a clinical neuropsychologist. A clinical neuropsychologist must be able to determine whether a symptom(s) may be caused by an injury to the head through interviewing a patient in order to determine what actions should be taken to best help the patient. Another duty of a clinical neuropsychologist is to find cerebral abnormalities and possible correlations. Evidence based practice in both research and treatment is paramount to appropriate clinical neuropsychological practice. Assessment is primarily by way of neuropsychological tests, but also includes patient history, qualitative observation and may draw on findings from neuroimaging and other diagnostic medical procedures. Clinical neuropsychology requires an in-depth knowledge of: neuroanatomy, neurobiology, psychopharmacology and neuropathology. History During the late 1800s, brain‚Äìbehavior relationships were interpreted by European physicians who observed and identified behavioural syndromes that were related with focal brain dysfunction. Clinical neuropsychology is a fairly new practice in comparison to other specialty fields in psychology with history going back to the 1960s. The specialty focus of clinical neuropsychology evolved slowly into a more defined whole as interest grew. Threads from neurology, clinical psychology, psychiatry, cognitive psychology, and psychometrics all have been woven together to create the intricate tapestry of clinical neuropsychology, a practice which is very much so still evolving. The history of clinical neuropsychology is long and complicated due to its ties to so many older practices. Researchers like Thomas Willis (1621‚Äì1675) who has been credited with creating neurology, John Hughlings Jackson (1835‚Äì1911) who theorized that cognitive processes occurred in specific parts of the brain, Paul Broca (1824‚Äì1880) and Karl Wernicke (1848‚Äì1905) who studied the human brain in relation to psychopathology, Jean Martin Charcot (1825‚Äì1893) who apprenticed Sigmund Freud (1856‚Äì1939) who created the psychoanalytic theory all contributed to clinical medicine which later contributed to clinical neuropsychology. The field of psychometrics contributed to clinical neuropsychology through individuals such as Francis Galton (1822‚Äì1911) who collected quantitative data on physical and sensory characteristics, Karl Pearson (1857‚Äì1936) who established the statistics which psychology now relies on, Wilhelm Wundt (1832‚Äì1920) who created the first psychology lab, his student Charles Spearman (1863‚Äì1945) who furthered statistics through discoveries like factor analysis, Alfred Binet (1857‚Äì1911) and his apprentice Theodore Simon (1872‚Äì1961) who together made the Binet- Simon scale of intellectual development, and Jean Piaget (1896‚Äì1980) who studied child development. Studies in intelligence testing made by Lewis Terman (1877‚Äì1956) who updated the Binet-Simon scale to the Stanford-Binet intelligence scale, Henry Goddard (1866‚Äì1957) who developed different classification scales, and Robert Yerkes (1876‚Äì1956) who was in charge of the Army Alpha and Beta tests also all contributed to where clinical neuropsychology is today. Clinical neuropsychology focuses on the brain and goes back to the beginning of the 20th century. As a clinician a clinical neuropsychologist offers their services by addressing three steps; assessment, diagnosis, and treatment. The term clinical neuropsychologist was first made by Sir William Osler on April 16, 1913. While clinical neuropsychology was not a focus until the 20th century evidence of brain and behavior treatment and studies are seen as far back as the neolithic area when trephination, a crude surgery in which a piece of the skull is removed, has been observed in skulls. As a profession, clinical neuropsychology is a subspecialty beneath clinical psychology. During World War I (1914‚Äì1918) the early term shell shock was first observed in soldiers who survived the war. This was the beginning of efforts to understand traumatic events and how they affected people. During the Great Depression (1929‚Äì1941) further stressors caused shell shock like symptoms to emerge. In World War II (1939‚Äì1945) the term shell shock was changed to battle fatigue and clinical neuropsychology became even more involved with attempting to solve the puzzle of peoples' continued signs of trauma and distress. The Veterans Administration or VA was created in 1930 which increased the call for clinical neuropsychologists and by extension the need for training. The Korean (1950‚Äì1953) and Vietnam Wars (1960‚Äì1973) further solidified the need for treatment by trained clinical neuropsychologists. In 1985 the term post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD was coined and the understanding that traumatic events of all kinds could cause PTSD started to evolve. The relationship between human behavior and the brain is the focus of clinical neuropsychology as defined by Meir in 1974. There are two subdivisions of clinical neuropsychology which draw much focus; organic and environmental natures. Ralph M. Reitan, Arthur L. Benton, and A.R. Luria are all past neuropsychologists whom believed and studied the organic nature of clinical neuropsychology. On the other side, environmental nature of clinical neuropsychology did not appear until more recently and is characterized by treatments such as behavior therapy. The relationship between physical brain abnormalities and the presentation of psychopathology is not completely understood, but this is one of the questions which clinical neuropsychologists hope to answer in time. In 1861 the debate over human potentiality versus localization began. The two sides argued over how human behavior presented in the brain. Paul Broca postulated that cognitive problems could be caused by physical damage to specific parts of the brain based on a case study of his in which he found a lesion on the brain of a deceased patient who had presented the symptom of being unable to speak, that portion of the brain is now known as Broca's Area. In 1874 Carl Wernicke also made a similar observation in a case study involving a patient with a brain lesion whom was unable to comprehend speech, the part of the brain with the lesion is now deemed Wernicke's Area. Both Broca and Wernicke believed and studied the theory of localization. On the other hand, equal potentiality theorists believed that brain function was not based on a single piece of the brain but rather on the brain as a whole. Marie J.P Flourens conducted animal studies in which he found that the amount of brain tissue damaged directly affected the amount that behavior ability was altered or damaged. Kurt Goldstein observed the same idea as Flourens except in veterans who had fought in World War I. In the end, despite all of the disagreement, neither theory completely explains the human brains complexity. Thomas Hughlings Jackson created a theory which was thought to be a possible solution. Jackson believed that both potentiality and localization were in part correct and that behavior was made by multiple parts of the brain working collectively to cause behaviors, and Luria (1966‚Äì1973) furthered Jackson's theory. The job When considering where a clinical neuropsychologist works, hospitals are a common place for practitioners to end up. There are three main variations in which a clinical neuropsychologist may work at a hospital; as an employee, consultant, or independent practitioner. As a clinical neuropsychologist working as an employee of a hospital the individual may receive a salary, benefits, and sign a contract for employment. In the case of an employee of a hospital the hospital is in charge of legal and financial responsibilities. The second option of working as a consultant implies that the clinical neuropsychologist is part of a private practice or is a member of a physicians group. In this scenario, the clinical neuropsychologist may work in the hospital like the employee of the hospital but all financial and legal responsibilities go through the group which the clinical neuropsychologist is a part of. The third option is an independent practitioner whom works alone and may even have their office outside of the hospital or rent a room in the hospital. In the third case, the clinical neuropsychologist is completely on their own and in charge of their own financial and legal responsibilities. =Assessment= Assessments are used in clinical neuropsychology to find brain psychopathologies of the cognitive, behavioral, and emotional variety. Physical evidence is not always readily visible so clinical neuropsychologists must rely on assessments to tell them the extent of the damage. The cognitive strengths and weaknesses of the patient are assessed to help narrow down the possible causes of the brain pathology. A clinical neuropsychologist is expected to help educate the patient on what is happening to them so that the patient can understand how to work with their own cognitive deficits and strengths. An assessment should accomplish many goals such as; gage consequences of impairments to quality of life, compile symptoms and the change in symptoms over time, and assess cognitive strengths and weaknesses. Accumulation of the knowledge earned from the assessment is then dedicated to developing a treatment plan based on the patient's individual needs. An assessment can also help the clinical neuropsychologist gage the impact of medications and neurosurgery on a patient. Behavioral neurology and neuropsychology tools can be standardized or psychometric tests and observational data collected on the patient to help build an understanding of the patient and what is happening with them. There are essential prerequisites which must be present in a patient in order for the assessment to be effective; concentration, comprehension, and motivation and effort. Lezak lists six primary reasons neuropsychological assessments are carried out: diagnosis, patient care and its planning, treatment planning, treatment evaluation, research and forensic neuropsychology. To conduct a comprehensive assessment will typically take several hours and may need to be conducted over more than a single visit. Even the use of a screening battery covering several cognitive domains may take 1.5‚Äì2 hours. At the commencement of the assessment it is important to establish a good rapport with the patient and ensure they understand the nature and aims of the assessment. Neuropsychological assessment can be carried out from two basic perspectives, depending on the purpose of assessment. These methods are normative or individual. Normative assessment, involves the comparison of the patient‚Äôs performance against a representative population. This method may be appropriate in investigation of an adult onset brain insult such as traumatic brain injury or stroke. Individual assessment may involve serial assessment, to establish whether declines beyond those which are expected to occur with normal aging, as with dementia or another neurodegenerative condition. Assessment can be further subdivided into sub-sections: =History taking= Neuropsychological assessments usually commence with a clinical interview as a means of collecting a history, which is relevant to the interpretation of any later neuropsychological tests. In addition, this interview provides qualitative information about the patient‚Äôs ability to act in a socially apt manner, organise and communicate information effectively and provide an indication as to the patient‚Äôs mood, insight and motivation. It is only within the context of a patient‚Äôs history that an accurate interpretation of their test data and thus a diagnosis can be made. The clinical interview should take place in a quiet area free from distractions. Important elements of a history include demographic information, description of presenting problem, medical history (including any childhood or developmental problems, psychiatric and psychological history), educational and occupational history (and if any legal history and military history.) =Selection of neuropsychological tests= It is not uncommon for patients to be anxious about being tested; explaining that tests are designed so that they will challenge everyone and that no one is expected to answer all questions correctly may be helpful. An important consideration of any neuropsychological assessment is a basic coverage of all major cognitive functions. The most efficient way to achieve this is the administration of a battery of tests covering: attention, visual perception and reasoning, learning and memory, verbal function, construction, concept formation, executive function, motor abilities and emotional status. Beyond this basic battery, choices of neuropsychological tests to be administered are mainly made on the basis of which cognitive functions need to be evaluated in order to fulfill the assessment objectives. =Report writing= Following a neuropsychological assessment it is important to complete a comprehensive report based on the assessment conducted. The report is for other clinicians, as well as the patient and their family so it is important to avoid jargon or the use of language which has different clinical and lay meanings (e.g. intellectually disabled as the correct clinical term for an IQ below 70, but offensive in lay language). The report should cover background to the referral, relevant history, reasons for assessment, neuropsychologists observations of patient‚Äôs behaviour, test administered and results for cognitive domains tested, any additional findings (e.g. questionnaires for mood) and finish the report with a summary and recommendations. In the summary it is important to comment on what the profile of results indicates regarding the referral question. The recommendations section contains practical information to assist the patient and family, or improve the management of the patient‚Äôs condition. Educational requirements of different countries The educational requirements for becoming a clinical neuropsychologist differ between countries. In some countries it may be necessary to complete a clinical psychology degree, before specialising with further studies in clinical neuropsychology. While some countries offer clinical neuropsychology courses to students who have completed 4 years of psychology studies. All clinical neuropsychologists require a postgraduate qualification, whether it be a Masters or Doctorate (Ph.D, Psy.D. or D.Psych). =Australia= To become a clinical neuropsychologist in Australia requires the completion of a 3-year Australian Psychology Accreditation Council (APAC) approved undergraduate degree in psychology, a 1-year psychology honours, followed by a 2-year Masters or 3-year Doctorate of Psychology (D.Psych) in clinical neuropsychology. These courses involve coursework (lectures, tutorials, practicals etc.), supervised practice placements and the completion of a research thesis. Masters and D.Psych courses involve the same amount of coursework units, but differ in the amount of supervised placements undertaken and length of research thesis. Masters courses require a minimum of 1,000 hours (125 days) and D.Psych courses require a minimum of 1,500 hours (200 days), it is mandatory that these placements expose students to acute neurology/neurosurgery, rehabilitation, psychiatric, geriatric and paediatric populations. =Canada= To become a clinical neuropsychologist in Canada requires the completion of a 4-year honours degree in psychology and a 4-year doctoral degree in clinical neuropsychology. Often a 2-year master's degree is required before commencing the doctoral degree. The doctoral degree involves coursework and practical experience (practicum and internship). Practicum is between 600 and 1,000 hours of practical application of skills acquired in the program. At least 300 hours must be supervised, face-to-face client contact. The practicum is intended to prepare students for the internship/residency. Internships/residencies are a year long experience in which the student functions as a neuropsychologist, under supervision. Currently, there are 3 CPA-accredited Clinical Neuropsychology internships/residencies in Canada,http://www.cpa.ca/accreditation/cpaaccreditedprograms/ although other unaccredited ones exist. Prior to commencing the internship students must have completed all doctoral coursework, received approval for their thesis proposal (if not completed the thesis) and the 600 hours of practicum. =United Kingdom= To become a clinical neuropsychologist in the UK, requires prior qualification as a clinical or educational psychologist as recognised by the Health Professions Council, followed by further postgraduate study in clinical neuropsychology. In its entirety, education to become a clinical neuropsychologist in the UK consists of the completion of a 3-year British Psychological Society accredited undergraduate degree in psychology, 3-year Doctorate in clinical (usually D.Clin.Psy.) or educational psychology (D.Ed.Psy.), followed by a 1-year Masters (MSc) or 9-month Postgraduate Diploma (PgDip) in Clinical Neuropsychology. The British Psychological Division of Counselling Psychology are also currently offering training to its members in order to ensure that they can apply to be registered Neuropsychologists also. =United States= In order to become a clinical neuropsychologist in the US and be compliant with Houston Conference Guidelines, the completion of a 4-year undergraduate degree in psychology and a 4 to 5-year doctoral degree (Psy.D. or Ph.D.) must be completed. After the completion of the doctoral coursework, training and dissertation, students must complete a 1-year internship, followed by an additional 2 years of supervised residency. The doctoral degree, internship and residency must all be undertaken at American Psychological Association approved institutions. After the completion of all training, students must apply to become licensed in their state to practice psychology. The American Board of Clinical Neuropsychology, The American Board of Professional Neuropsychology, and The American Board of Pediatric Neuropsychology all award board certification to neuropsychologists that demonstrate competency in specific areas of neuropsychology, by reviewing the neuropsychologist's training, experience, submitted case samples, and successfully completing both written and oral examinations. Although these requirements are standard according to Houston Conference Guidelines, even these guidelines have stated that the completion of all of these requirements is still aspirational, and other ways of achieving clinical neuropsychologist status are possible.

(2011). Government of Canada. As of 2005, she holds more than 20 degrees and continues to work in her nineties. Her current work explores the interaction between the brain's left and right hemispheres. Milner has been called the founder of neuropsychology, and has proven to be an essential key in its development. She received the Balzan Prize for Cognitive Neuroscience, in 2009, and the Kavli Prize in Neuroscience, together with John O'Keefe, and Marcus E. Raichle, in 2014. She turned 100 in July 2018 and at the time was still overseeing the work of researchers. Early life Brenda Langford (later Milner by marriage) was born on July 15, 1918, in Manchester, England. Milner's father Samuel Langford was a musical critic, journalist, and teacher and her mother (n√©e Leslie Doig) was a singing student. Though she was a daughter to two musically talented parents she had no interest in music. At the age of 6 months, she and her mother both contracted influenza during the influenza pandemic of 1918. This illness killed between 20 and 40 million people, more than were killed in World War I. However, she and her mother both recovered from this sickness. She was tutored by her father in mathematics and the arts until the age of 8.\\" She attended Withington Girls' School, which led her to attend Newnham College, Cambridge, to study mathematics, having received a scholarship in 1936. Brenda was one of only 400 women admitted to this prestigious school at this time. However, after realizing she was not \\"perceptive\\" enough for mathematics, Milner changed her field of study to psychology. In 1939, Milner graduated with a B.A. degree in experimental psychology, which at that time was considered a moral science. Education Her supervisor at Newnham College, Cambridge was Oliver Zangwill and to him she owed her first interest in human brain function, and the value of studying brain lesions. Oliver Zangwill was a Cambridge graduate with First Class Honors with Special Distinction. \\"He immediately began postgraduate research with Frederic Bartlett, who was by then Cambridge's first Professor of Experimental Psychology.\\" Zangwill's career with Bartlett won him an honorable reputation. \\"Working with Bartlett was of significance for Zangwill's career as Bartlett had an extraordinarily powerful effect on the shape of British academic psychology.\\" After her graduation near the time of World War II Newnham College awarded her a Sarah Smithson Research Studentship, which allowed her to attend Newnham for the following two years. As a result of World War II, the work of the Cambridge Psychological Laboratory, under Bartlett's leadership, was diverted almost overnight to applied research in the selection of aircrew. Milner's position was to devise perceptual tasks for future use in selecting aircrew. More specifically, she was on a team interested in distinguishing fighter pilots from bomber pilots using aptitude tests. \\"Later in the war, from 1941 to 1944, she worked in Malvern as an Experimental Officer for the Ministry of Supply, investigating different methods of display and control to be used by radar operators.\\" In 1941 Brenda met her husband, Peter Milner. Both Brenda and her husband were working on radar research. He was an electrical engineer who had also been recruited for the war effort. In 1944, they married and left for Canada where Peter had been invited to work with physicists on atomic research. They traveled to Boston on the ship the Queen Elizabeth together with \\"war brides\\" who were traveling to the United States to live with their husbands' families during the war. Upon arrival in Canada, she began teaching psychology at the University of Montreal, where she stayed for 7 years. In 1949, Brenda Milner graduated with a M.A. in experimental psychology. In Montreal, she became a Ph.D. candidate in physiological psychology at McGill University, under the direction of Donald Olding Hebb. While working on her Ph.D., Milner and Hebb presented research on their patient P.B. who had undergone a medial temporal lobectomy and had subsequent memory impairment. This garnered the attention of Wilder Penfield. In 1950, Hebb gave Milner an opportunity to study with him at the Montreal Neurological Institute. Alongside Penfield, she studied the behavior of a young adult epileptic patients treated with elective focal ablation of brain tissue to treat uncontrolled seizures. In 1952, Milner earned her Ph.D. in experimental psychology with a thesis on liberalization of temporal lobe function. In addition, Milner earned her D.Sc. in experimental psychology from the University of Cambridge. Brenda Milner. Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital, McGill University, 2019. Professional career In 1954, Milner published an article in the McGill University Psychological Bulletin entitled \\"Intellectual Function of the Temporal Lobes\\"; within this publication she brought to light that temporal lobe damage can cause emotional and intellectual changes in humans and lower primates. In this work, Milner reviewed animal studies of neural function and compared it to human neuroscience work. Her publication discouraged many neurosurgeons from completing surgeries on human beings that could negatively impact their lives. \\"Milner's early work on the temporal lobes was influenced by the results of ablation work with lower primates, and particularly by Mishkin and Pribram's discovery of the role of the inferotemporal neocortex in visual discrimination learning.\\" Milner was a pioneer in the field of neuropsychology and in the study of memory and other cognitive functions in humankind. She studied the effects of damage to the medial temporal lobe on memory and systematically described the deficits in the most famous patient in cognitive neuroscience, Henry Molaison, formerly known as patient H.M. Though he was not able to remember new events he was able to learn new motor skills. Milner was invited to Hartford to study H.M., \\"who had undergone a bilateral temporal lobectomy that included removal of major portions of the hippocampus.\\"Turner, M. S. (2010). Tracing Permanent Memories . The DANA Foundation. In the early stages of her work with H.M., Milner wanted to completely understand his memory impairments. Dr. Milner showed that the medial temporal lobe amnestic syndrome is characterized by an inability to acquire new memories and an inability to recall established memories from a few years immediately before damage, while memories from the more remote past and other cognitive abilities, including language, perception and reasoning were intact. For example, Milner spent three days with H.M. as he learned a new perceptual-motor task in order to determine what type of learning and memory were intact in him. This task involved reproducing the drawing of a star by looking at it in a mirror. His performance improved over those three days. However, he retained absolutely no memory of any events that took place during those three days. This led Milner to speculate that there are different types of learning and memory, each dependent on a separate system of the brain .Xia, C. (2006). Understanding the Human Brain: A lifetime of Dedicated Pursuit. Interview with Dr. Brenda Milner. McGill Journal of Medicine, 9(2), 165‚Äì172. She was able to demonstrate two different memory systems- episodic memory and procedural memory. Milner discovered from H.M. and other case studies that \\"bilateral medial temporal- lobe resection in man results in a persistent impairment of recent memory whenever the removal is carried far enough posteriorly to damage portions of the anterior hippocampus and hippocampal gyrus.\\" She showed that in patients with this syndrome the ability to learn certain motor skills remained normal. This finding introduced the concept of multiple memory systems within the brain and stimulated an enormous body of research. Milner stated in an interview with the McGill Journal of Medicine, \\"To see that HM had learned the task perfectly but with absolutely no awareness that he had done it before was an amazing dissociation. If you want to know what was an exciting moment of my life, that was one.\\" She has made major contributions to the understanding of the role of the frontal lobes in memory processing, in the area of organizing information. \\"Dr. Milner's seminal research has provided many landmark discoveries in the study of human memory and the brain's temporal lobes, which play a key role in emotional responses, hearing, memory and speech.\\" She demonstrated the critical role of the dorsolateral frontal cortex for the temporal organization of memory and her work showed that there is partial separability of the neural circuits subserving recognition memory from those mediating memory for temporal order. She described the inflexibility in problem solving that is now widely recognized as a common consequence of frontal-lobe injury. These refinements in the understanding of memory and exposition of the relevant brain regions revealed the diffuse nature of complex cognitive functions in the brain. Milner helped describe the lateralization of function in the human brain and has shown how the representation of language in the cerebral hemispheres can vary in left- handed, right-handed and ambidextrous individuals (see handedness). These studies of the relationship between hand preference and speech lateralization led to an understanding of the effects of early unilateral brain lesions on the pattern of cerebral organization at maturity. Her studies were among the first to demonstrate convincingly that damage to the brain can lead to dramatic functional reorganization. Using mostly prize money from her numerous awards, Milner donated 1 million dollars to the Montreal Neurological Institute in 2007, after establishing a foundation in her name. Since 2005 Brenda Milner in 2014 In 2005, she expanded her research to the study of brain activity in normal subjects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). These studies focus on the identification of brain regions associated with spatial memory and language, including the neural substrates of monolingual and bilingual speech processing. In another series of PET studies, she has sought to delineate further the role of the right hippocampal region in memory for the spatial location of objects. Milner had still been teaching and researching. She is the Dorothy J. Killam Professor at the Montreal Neurological Institute, and a professor in the Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery at McGill University. One of Milner's current collaborators is Denise Klein, an assistant professor in the Neurology/Cognitive Neuroscience unit at McGill.The Great Canadian Psychologist Website. (2008). Their research on bilingualism entails investigating the difference in neural pathways used to acquire new and native languages. In 2018, Milner celebrated her 100th birthday in Montreal with about 30 friends, including fellow researcher Dr. Denise Klein. Although she never expected to reach this age, Milner stated that she has \\"every intention of continuing for many more birthdays.\\" The Montreal Neurological Institute held a symposium in September 2018, celebrating her accomplishments. That same year, Milner participated in a video series, launched by the Montreal Neurological Institute, dedicated to promoting female scientists and researchers. xxceptional-women, McGill University, youtube.com During the interview, Milner spoke about her early life and gave an overview of her career. Awards and honours Milner has received numerous awards for her contributions to neuroscience and psychology including memberships in the Royal Society of London, the Royal Society of Canada and the National Academy of Sciences. In total, she has been awarded honorary degrees from more than 20 different universities across Canada, Europe, and the United States. Early on, Milner was awarded a Sarah Smithson Research Studentship by Newnham College, Cambridge after her graduation, which allowed her to attend Newnham. In 1984 Milner was made an Officer of the Order of Canada and was promoted to Companion in 2004. In 1987, she was awarded the Ralph W. Gerard Prize in Neuroscience. She was also awarded the National Academy of Sciences Award in the Neurosciences in 2004 for her seminal investigations of the role of the temporal lobes and other brain regions in learning, memory, and language.Nas Award in the Neurosciences. (2012). In 1985, she was made an Officer of the National Order of Quebec and was promoted to Grand Officer in 2009. She was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2007. She was awarded the Balzan Prize for her contributions to Cognitive Neurosciences in a ceremony held in the Swiss Parliament in December 2009.

Their languages are Central Sudanic languages and Bantu languages. Subgroups The Mbuti population live in the Ituri Forest, a tropical rainforest covering about 70,000 km2 of the north/northeast portion of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Many Batwa in various parts of the DRC call themselves Bambuti as well. https://minorityrights.org/minorities/batwa-and-bambuti/ Bambuti are pygmy hunter-gatherers, and are one of the oldest indigenous people of the Congo region of Africa. The Bambuti are composed of bands which are relatively small in size, ranging from 15 to 60 people. The Bambuti population totals about 30,000 to 40,000 people. There are three distinct subgroups: * The Sua (also Kango, or Mbuti), who speak a dialect (or perhaps two) of the language of a neighboring Bantu people, Bila. They are located centrally and are eponymous of the larger group. * The Ef√©, who speak the language of the neighboring Central Sudanic Lese. * The Asua, speakers of the Mangbetu (Central Sudanic) Asua language.  Environment  Map of Ituri Rainforest within the DRC The forest of Ituri is a tropical rainforest. In this area, there is a high amount of rainfall annually, ranging from 50 to 70 inches (127 cm to 178 cm). The rainforest covers 70,000 square kilometers. The Mbuti population lives in the Ituri Forest, a tropical rainforest covering about 70,000 km2 of the north/northeast portion of the Congo. The dry season is in January, and then May through August. The forest is a moist, humid region strewn with rivers and lakes. Several ecological problems exist which affect the Bambuti. Disease is prevalent in the forests and can spread quickly, killing not only humans, but plants, and animals, the major source of food, as well. One disease, carried by tsetse flies, is sleeping sickness, which limits the use of large mammals. Too much rainfall, as well as droughts, can greatly diminish the food supply. Culture = Settlement architecture and organization = The Bambuti live in villages that are categorized as bands. Each hut houses a family unit. At the start of the dry season, they leave the village to enter the forest and set up a series of camps. This way, the Bambuti are able to utilize more land area for maximum foraging. These villages are solitary and separated from other groups of people. Their houses are small, circular, and very temporary. House construction begins with the tracing of the outline of the house into the ground. The walls of the structures are strong sticks that are placed in the ground, and at the top of the sticks, a vine is tied around them to keep them together. Large leaves and grass are used in the construction of the hut roofs. = Food and resources = Mbuti net-hunter in Okapi Wildlife Reserve The Bambuti are primarily hunter-gatherers. Their animal diet can include crabs, shellfish, elephant, ants, larvae, snails, wild pigs, antelopes, monkeys, fish, and honey. The vegetable component of their diet includes wild yams, berries, fruits, roots, leaves, and kola nuts. While hunting, the Bambuti have been known to specifically target the giant forest hog. The meat obtained from the giant forest hog (as is the meat from rats) is often considered kweri, a bad animal which may cause illness to those who eat it, but is often valuable as a trade good between the Bambuti and agriculturalist Bantu groups. Some lore is thought to have identified giant forest hogs as kweri due to their nocturnal habits and penchant for disruption of the few agricultural advances the Bambuti have made. This lore can be tied to Bambuti mythology, where the giant forest hog is thought to be a physical manifestation of Negoogunogumbar. Further, there are unconfirmed reports of giant forest hogs eating Bambuti infants from their cribs in the night. Other food sources yielded by the forest are non-kweri animals for meat consumption, root plants, palm trees, and bananas; and in some seasons, wild honey. Yams, legumes, beans, peanuts, hibiscus, amaranth, and gourds are consumed. The Bambuti use large nets, traps, and bows and arrows to hunt game. Women and children sometimes assist in the hunt by driving the prey into the nets. Both sexes gather and forage. Each band has its own hunting ground, although boundaries are hard to maintain. The Mbuti call the forest \\"mother\\" and \\"father\\" as the mood seizes them, because, like their parents, the forest gives them food, shelter, and clothing, which are readily made from abundant forest materials. The Bantu villagers produce many items that the hunter- gatherers trade some of their products for. They often obtain iron goods, pots, wooden goods, and basketry, in exchange for meat, animal hides, and other forest goods. Bushmeat is a particularly frequently traded item. They will also trade to obtain agricultural products from the villagers through barter. Hunting is usually done in groups, with men, women, and children all aiding in the process. Women and children are not involved if the hunting involves the use of a bow and arrow, but if nets are used, it is common for everyone to participate. In some instances, women may hunt using a net more often than men. The women and the children herd the animals to the net, while the men guard the net. Everyone engages in foraging, and women and men both take care of the children. Women are in charge of cooking, cleaning and repairing the hut, and obtaining water. The kin-based units work together to provide food and care for the young. It is easier for men to lift the women into the trees for honey. = Kinship and descent system = The Bambuti tend to follow a patrilineal descent system, and their residences after marriage are patrilocal. However, the system is rather loose. The only type of group seen amongst the Bambuti is the nuclear family. Kinship also provides allies for each group of people. = Marriage customs = Sister exchange is the common form of marriage. Based on reciprocal exchange, men from other bands exchange sisters or other females to whom they have ties. In Bambuti society, bride wealth is not customary. There is no formal marriage ceremony: a couple are considered officially married when the groom presents his bride's parents with an antelope he alone has hunted and killed. Polygamy does occur, but at different rates depending on the group, and it is not very common. The sexual intercourse of married couples is regarded as an act entirely different from that of unmarried partners, for only in marriage may children be conceived. = Political structure = Bambuti societies have no ruling group or lineage, no overlying political organization, and little social structure. The Bambuti are an egalitarian society in which the band is the highest form of social organization. Leadership may be displayed for example on hunting treks. Men become leaders because they are good hunters. Owing to their superior hunting ability, leaders eat more meat and fat and fewer carbohydrates than other men. Men and women basically have equal power. Issues are discussed and decisions are made by consensus at fire camps; men and women engage in the conversations equivalently. If there is a disagreement, misdemeanor, or offense, then the offender may be banished, beaten, or scorned. In more recent times the practice is to remove the offender from the forest and have them work for private landowners for little to no pay. =Mythology= Everything in the Bambuti life is centered on the forest. They consider the forest to be their great protector and provider and believe that it is a sacred place. They sometimes call the forest \\"mother\\" or \\"father\\". An important ritual that impacts the Bambuti's life is referred to as molimo. After events such as death of an important person in the tribe, molimo is noisily celebrated to wake the forest, in the belief that if bad things are happening to its children, it must be asleep. As with many Bambuti rituals, the time it takes to complete a molimo is not rigidly set; instead, it is determined by the mood of the group. Food is collected from each hut to feed the molimo, and in the evening the ritual is accompanied by the men dancing and singing around the fire. Women and children must remain in their huts with the doors closed. These practices were studied thoroughly by British anthropologist Colin Turnbull, known primarily for his work with the tribe. \\"Molimo\\" is also the name of a trumpet the men play during the ritual. Traditionally, it was made of wood or sometimes bamboo, but Turnbull also reported the use of metal drainpipes. The sound produced by a molimo is considered more important than the material it is made out of. When not in use, the trumpet is stored in the trees of the forest. During a celebration, the trumpet is retrieved by the youth of the village and carried back to the fire.  Contemporary situation  The way of life of the Bambuti is threatened for various reasons. Their territory in the DRC has no legal protections, and the boundaries that each band claims are not formally established. Bambuti are no longer allowed to hunt large game. Due to deforestation, gold mining, and modern influences from plantations, agriculturalists, and efforts to conserve the forests, their food supply is threatened. There is also significant civil unrest in the country. The Bambuti have also been targets of a genocide campaign known as Effacer le tableau. Genetics Y-chromosomal haplogroup E-M200 has been found in 25% (3/12) of a small sample of Mbuti from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Haplogroup B-P7 has been observed most frequently in samples of some populations of pygmies 21% (10/47) Mbuti from Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Similarly-named stores operated in some Soviet republics and in post-Soviet states. The most famous GUM is the large store facing Red Square in the Kitai- gorod area ‚Äì itself traditionally a trading center of Moscow. , the building functions as a shopping mall. Before the 1920s the location was known as the Upper Trading Rows (). As of 2020, GUM carries over 100 different brands, and has cafes and restaurants inside the mall. Moscow GUM =Design and structure= Shukhov's roof With the fa√ßade extending for along the eastern side of Red Square, the Upper Trading Rows were built between 1890 and 1893 by Alexander Pomerantsev (responsible for architecture) and Vladimir Shukhov (responsible for engineering). The trapezoidal building features a combination of elements of Russian medieval architecture and a steel framework and glass roof, a similar style to the great 19th-century railway stations of London. William Craft Brumfield described the GUM building as \\"a tribute both to Shukhov's design and to the technical proficiency of Russian architecture toward the end of the 19th century\\". The glass-‚Äãroofed design made the building unique at the time of construction. The roof, the diameter of which is , looks light, but it is a firm construction made of more than 50,000 metal pods (about ), capable of supporting snowfall accumulation. Illumination is provided by huge arched skylights of iron and glass, each weighing some and containing in excess of 20,000 panes of glass. The facade is divided into several horizontal tiers, lined with red Finnish granite, Tarusa marble, and limestone. Each arcade is on three levels, linked by walkways of reinforced concrete. =History= Inside the store in 1893: elongated shop galleries are bridged with innovative metal-and-glass vaults, designed by Vladimir Shukhov Inside view of the impressive structure and finish applied to the building Catherine II of Russia commissioned Giacomo Quarenghi, a Neoclassical architect from Italy, to design a huge trade center along the east side of Red Square. However, that building was lost to the 1812 Fire of Moscow and replaced by trading rows designed by Joseph Bove. In turn, the current structure replaced Bove's. By the time of the Russian Revolution of 1917, the building contained some 1,200 stores. After the Revolution, the GUM was nationalized. During the NEP period (1921‚Äì28), however, GUM as a State Department Store operated as a model retail enterprise for consumers throughout Russia regardless of class, gender, and ethnicity. GUM's stores were used to further Bolshevik goals of rebuilding private enterprise along socialist lines and \\"democratizing consumption for workers and peasants nationwide\\". In the end, GUM's efforts to build communism through consumerism were unsuccessful and arguably \\"only succeeded in alienating consumers from state stores and instituting a culture of complaint and entitlement\\". GUM continued to be used as a department store until Joseph Stalin converted it into office space in 1928 for the committee in charge of his first Five Year Plan. After the suicide of Stalin's wife Nadezhda in 1932, the GUM was used briefly to display her body. After reopening as a department store in 1953, the GUM became one of the few stores in the Soviet Union that did not have shortages of consumer goods, and the queues of shoppers were long, often extending entirely across Red Square. At the end of the Soviet era, GUM was partially, then fully privatized, and it had a number of owners before it ended up being owned by the supermarket company Perekryostok. In May 2005, a 50.25% interest was sold to Bosco di Ciliegi, a Russian luxury goods distributor and boutique operator. As a private shopping mall, it was renamed in such a fashion that it could maintain its old abbreviation and thus still be called GUM. However, the first word Gosudarstvennyi (\\"state\\") has been replaced with Glavnyi (\\"main\\"), so that GUM is now an abbreviation for \\"Main Universal Store\\".

After graduating from DuSable High School in 1954, he joined the United States Marine Corps and served 18 months in Korea. He worked at various jobs following his stint in the military, including selling tires, automobiles, and insurance, and as an officer with the Chicago Police Department.O'Donnell, Maureen. \\"'Soul Train' creator, South Side native Cornelius dead in suicide\\", Chicago Sun-Times, February 2, 2012. Retrieved January 8, 2018. He quit his day job to take a three-month broadcasting course in 1966, despite being married with two sons and having only $400 in his bank account. In 1966, he landed a job as an announcer, news reporter and disc jockey on Chicago radio station WVON. Cornelius joined Chicago television station WCIU-TV in 1967 and hosted a news program called A Black's View of the News. In 1970, he launched Soul Train on WCIU-TV as a daily local show. The program entered national syndication and moved to Los Angeles the following year. Eddie Kendricks, Gladys Knight & the Pips, Bobby Hutton and Honey Cone were featured on the national debut episode. Originally a journalist and inspired by the civil rights movement, Cornelius recognized that in the late 1960s there were very few television venues in the United States for soul music (at the time, only one series, the public television show Soul!, was focused on the genre). He introduced many African-American musicians to a larger audience as a result of their appearances on Soul Train, a program that was both influential among African Americans and popular with a wider audience.David Hinckley, \\"VH1's 'Hippest Trip' reveals how Don Cornelius put 'Soul Train' on the fast track\\", New York Daily News, February 5, 2010. Retrieved January 8, 2018. As writer, producer, and host of Soul Train, Cornelius was instrumental in offering wider exposure to black musicians such as James Brown, Aretha Franklin, Marvin Gaye, and Michael Jackson, as well as creating opportunities for talented dancers, setting a precedent for popular television dance programs. Cornelius said, \\"We had a show that kids gravitated to,\\" and Spike Lee described the program as an \\"urban music time capsule\\". With the creation of Soul Train, Cornelius was at the helm of a program that showed African Americans in a new light, creating a Black is Beautiful Campaign.PBS Prior to Soul Train, African Americans were only occasionally performing on TV, mostly as guests on white-centered programs. Soul Train showcased African American culture, and brought African American musicians and dancers to television. This show's appeal to white audiences steadily grew and eventually earned a huge following. Cornelius (second from right) with The Staple Singers during production of a 1974 episode of Soul Train. Besides his smooth and deep voice and his afro (which slowly shrunk over the years as hairstyle tastes changed), Cornelius was best known for the catchphrase that he used to close the show: \\"and you can bet your last money, it's all gonna be a stone gas, honey! I'm Don Cornelius, and as always in parting, we wish you love, peace and soul!\\" After Cornelius's departure, it was shortened to \\"and as always, we wish you love, peace and soul!\\" and it was used through the most recent new episodes in 2006. Another introductory phrase which he often used was: \\"We got another sound comin' out of Philly that's a sure 'nough dilly\\". He had a small number of film roles, such as record producer Moe Fuzz in 1988's Tapeheads. Cornelius last appeared on the episode of the TV series Unsung featuring Full Force, which was aired two days before his death. Arrest On October 17, 2008, Cornelius was arrested at his Los Angeles home on Mulholland Drive on a felony domestic violence charge. He was released on bail. Cornelius appeared in court on November 14, 2008, and was charged with spousal abuse and dissuading a witness from filing a police report. Cornelius appeared in court again on December 4, 2008, and pleaded not guilty of spousal abuse and was banned from going anywhere near his estranged wife, Russian model Victoria Avila-Cornelius (Viktoria Chapman), who had obtained two restraining orders against him. On March 19, 2009, he changed his plea to no contest and was placed on 36 months of probation. Death In the early morning hours of February 1, 2012, police officers responded to a report of a shooting and found Cornelius on the floor of his home at Mulholland Drive, with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. He was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead by the Los Angeles County Assistant Chief Coroner. According to former Soul Train host Shemar Moore, Cornelius may have been suffering from the early onset of dementia or Alzheimer's disease, and his health had been in decline.

This small long-tailed dove is found in dry scrub and semi-desert habitats where pairs can often be seen feeding on the ground. A rufous and black chequered necklace gives it a distinctive pattern and is also easily distinguished from other doves by its call. Other names include laughing turtle dove, palm dove and Senegal dove while in India the name of the little brown dove is often used. Taxonomy In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the laughing dove in his six volume Ornithologie based on a specimen collected in Senegal. He used the French name La tourterelle √† gorge tachet√©e du S√©n√©gal and the Latin Tutur gutture maculato senegalensis. The two stars (**) at the start of the section indicates that Brisson based his description on the examination of a specimen. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the laughing dove which he placed with all the other pigeons in the genus Columba. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Columba senegalensis and cited Brisson's work. For many years the laughing dove was placed in the genus Streptopelia. A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2001 found this genus was paraphyletic with respect to Columba. To create monophyletic genera the laughing dove as well as the closely related spotted dove were moved to the resurrected genus Spilopelia that had been introduced by the Swedish zoologist Carl Sundevall in 1873. Although the title page in dated 1872, the part containing pages 100 and 186 was published in 1873. Five populations with small plumage and size differences have been given the status of subspecies: * S. s. phoenicophila (Hartert, 1916) ‚Äì Morocco to northwest Libya * S. s. aegyptiaca (Latham, 1790) ‚Äì Nile Valley (Egypt) * S. s. senegalensis (Linnaeus, 1766) ‚Äì west Arabia, Socotra Island, Africa south of the Sahara * S. s. cambayensis (Gmelin, JF, 1789) ‚Äì east Arabia and east Iran to India and Bangladesh * S. s. ermanni (Bonaparte, 1856) ‚Äì Kazakhstan, north Afghanistan, west China Several other subspecies have been described but are not now generally recognised. These include S. s. sokotrae on Socotra Island, S. s. dakhlae in the Dakhla Oasis, Libya and S. s. thome on S√£o Tom√© Island. Description The laughing dove is a long-tailed, slim pigeon, typically in length. It is pinkish brown on the underside with a lilac tinged head and neck. The head and underparts are pinkish, shading to buff on the lower abdomen. A chequered rufous and grey patch is found on the sides of the neck and are made up of split feathers. The upper parts are brownish with a bluish- grey band along the wing. The back is uniform and dull brown in the Indian population. The African populations senegalensis and phoenicophila have a bluish grey rump and upper tail coverts but differ in the shades of the neck and wing feathers while aegyptiaca is larger and the head and nape are vinous and upper wing coverts are rufous. The tail is graduated and the outer feathers are tipped in white. The sexes are indistinguishable in the field. Young birds lack the chequered neck markings. The legs are red. The populations vary slightly in plumage with those from more arid zones being paler. Abnormal leucistic plumages have been noted. The chuckling call is a low rolling croo-doo-doo-doo-doo with a rising and falling amplitude. Distribution and habitat It is a common and widespread species in scrub, dry farmland, and in areas of human habitation, often becoming very tame. Its range includes much of Sub-Saharan Africa, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India. It is also found in Cyprus, Israel, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, the UAE, and Turkey (these populations may be derived from human introductions). They are mostly sedentary but some populations may make movements. Birds ringed in Gujarat have been recovered 200 km north in Pakistan and exhausted birds have been recorded landing on ships in the Arabian Sea. The species (thought to belong to the nominate population) was introduced to Perth in 1889 and has become established around Western Australia. Birds that land on ships may be introduced to new regions. Behaviour and ecology The species is usually seen in pairs or small parties and only rarely in larger groups. Larger groups are formed especially when drinking at waterholes in arid regions. Small numbers assemble on trees near waterholes before flying to the water's edge where they are able to suck up water like other members of the pigeon family. Laughing doves eat the fallen seeds, mainly of grasses, other vegetable matter and small ground insects such as termites and beetles. They are fairly terrestrial, foraging on the ground in grasslands and cultivation. Their flight is quick and direct with the regular beats and an occasional sharp flick of the wings which are characteristic of pigeons in general. Nest on an olive tree with a typical clutch of two eggs, Djerba island The male in courtship display follows the female with head bobbing displays while cooing. The male pecks its folded wings in \\"displacement-preening\\" to solicit copulation from the female. A female accepts by crouching and begging for food. The male may indulge in courtship feeding before mounting and copulating. Pairs may preen each other. Males may also launch into the air with wing clapping sounds and then glide down in a gentle arc when displaying. The species has a spread out breeding season in Africa. Almost year-round in Malawi and Turkey; and mainly May to November in Zimbabwe, February to June in Egypt and Tunisia. In Australia the main breeding season is September to November. The nest is a very flimsy platform of twigs built in a low bush and sometimes in crevices or under the eaves of houses. Both parents build the nest with males bringing the twigs which are then placed by the female. Two eggs are laid within an interval of a day between them and both parents take part in building the nest, incubating and feeding the young. Males spend more time incubating the nest during the day. The eggs are incubated after the second egg is laid and the eggs hatch after about 13 to 15 days. Nesting adults may feign injury to distract and draw predators away from the nest. Multiple broods may be raised by the same pair in the same nest. Seven broods by the same pair have been noted in Turkey. The young fledge and leave the nest after about 14 to 16 days. The Jacobin cuckoo sometimes lays its egg in the nests of the laughing dove in Africa. Feral populations in Australia are sometimes infected by a virus that causes symptoms similar to that produced in parrots by psittacine beak and feather disease. Several ectoparasitic bird lice have been found on the species and include those in the genera Coloceras, Columbicola, Bonomiella and Hohorstiella. A blood parasite Trypanosoma hannae has been recorded in the species. Southern grey shrike have been observed preying on an adult laughing dove in northwestern India while the lizard buzzard is a predator of the species in Africa. South African birds sometimes show a beak deformity in which the upper mandible overgrowth occurs.

He was a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1774 and 1775 and a signatory to the Continental Association. Biography Edward was the son of William (1698‚Äì1756) and Mary (Scull) (1709‚Äì1790) Biddle. He was born in 1738 at Philadelphia, and had nine brothers and sisters, although two died in infancy. His formal education was limited to the common (public) schools and ended at about age fourteen. When the French and Indian War began in 1754 he joined the provincial forces as an Ensign. By the time he left the service, at the end of the war in 1763 he had been promoted to Captain. On June 6, 1761, Edward married Elizabeth Ross, the sister of George Ross. After the war he read law in the offices of her brother. By 1767 he had been admitted to the bar, and the couple moved to Reading where he began his practice. Although the couple had no children, they both came from large families. The Betsy Ross who gained fame as the seamstress of the first American flag was the wife of her nephew. He was the uncle of Congressman Richard Biddle and financier Nicholas Biddle. Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly Also in 1767, Biddle began his career in the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly as a representative for Berks County. He would serve there until the colonial assembly went out of business during the Revolution. While a representative, in 1768 he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.Bell, Whitfield J., and Charles Greifenstein, Jr. Patriot-Improvers: Biographical Sketches of Members of the American Philosophical Society. 3 vols. Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society, 1997, 2:280‚Äì283. He was also a member of the rebel provincial congress, and later the state General Assembly until 1778. He was a leader within that body of the Whig or radical group in the struggle to set Pennsylvania's course in the revolution. In 1774, Pennsylvania was divided about the looming revolution. The loyalists and the supporters of the Penn family in the Assembly were joined by the Quakers who opposed any war. As a result, in July, the Assembly sent a split delegation to the Continental Congress: Galloway, Humphreys, and Rhoads were all moderates, while Biddle, Mifflin, Morton, and Ross were radicals. That first Continental Congress produced a statement or Declaration of Rights, as well as a plan of union and pleas to King George to resolve the issues that separated the colonies from Great Britain. They also produced a renewal of the non-importation agreement that had been used during the Stamp Act protests. Edward Biddle was a member of the committee that drafted to Declaration of Rights, and later oversaw the printing of the resolutions the Congress had passed. Early in 1775, Governor John Penn called the Assembly into session, intent on having Pennsylvania send its own declarations to the crown. These would be based on the Galloway Plan that had been rejected by the Continental Congress, and would try to reconcile Pennsylvania with the British government. But the legislature mirrored the growing split within the colonies. The Whigs, led by Biddle and George Ross and John Dickinson won the day. Edward Biddle was elected speaker, replacing Joseph Galloway who had held the post the previous year. The actions of the Continental Congress were approved, and a more radical delegation was named to the next Congress. Biddle died in Chatsworth, Baltimore County, Maryland on September 5, 1779. He is buried in St. Pauls Churchyard in Baltimore.

The filter treats stormwater runoff from a residential area. Stormwater from streets is first routed to a small detention basin (rear of photo, behind berm), which removes coarse sediment. After filtration an under-drain piping system discharges the filtered water to an adjacent stream. A media filter is a type of filter that uses a bed of sand, peat, shredded tires, foam, crushed glass, geo-textile fabric, anthracite, crushed granite or other material to filter water for drinking, swimming pools, aquaculture, irrigation, stormwater management, oil & gas operations, and other applications. Filter design One design brings the water in the top of a container through a \\"header\\" which distributes the water evenly. The filter \\"media\\" start with fine sand on the top and then graduatingly coarser sand in a number of layers followed by gravel on the bottom, in gradually larger sizes. The top sand physically removes particles from the water. The job of the subsequent layers is to support the finer layer above and provide efficient drainage. As particles become trapped in the media, the differential pressure across the bed increases. Periodically, a backwash may be initiated to remove the solids trapped in the bed. During backwash, flow is directed in the opposite direction as normal flow. In multi-media filters, the layers in the media re-stratify due to density differences prior to resuming normal filtration. = Drinking water filtration systems = Municipal drinking water systems often use a rapid sand filter and/or a slow sand filter for purification. = Media filtration for stormwater = Media filter system for urban runoff Media filters are used to protect water quality in streams, rivers, and lakes.

The term was coined by Peter J. Landin, possibly as a pun on the offside rule in football. This is contrasted with free-form languages, notably curly-bracket programming languages, where indentation is not meaningful and indent style is only a matter of convention and code formatting. Definition Peter J. Landin, in an article called \\"The Next 700 Programming Languages\\", defined the off-side rule thus: \\"Any non-whitespace token to the left of the first such token on the previous line is taken to be the start of a new declaration.\\" Code examples The following is an example of indentation blocks in Python. The colons are part of the Python language syntax for readability;Python FAQ on colons they are not necessary to implement the off-side rule. In Python, the rule is taken to define the boundaries of statements rather than declarations. def is_even(a: (int, float)) -> bool: \\"\\"\\"Determine whether number 'a' is even.\\"\\"\\" if int(a % 2)  0: print('Even!') return True print('Odd!') return False Python also suspends the off-side rule within brackets. A statement within brackets continues until its brackets match (or mismatch): { \\"this\\": True, \\"that\\": False, \\"them\\": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 23] } In this dictionary, the keys are indented, and a list is split between two lines. Implementation The off-side rule can be implemented in the lexical analysis phase, as in Python, where increasing the indentation results in the lexer outputting an INDENT token, and decreasing the indentation results in the lexer outputting a DEDENT token.Python Documentation, 2. Lexical analysis: 2.1.8. Indentation These tokens correspond to the opening brace \`{\` and closing brace \`}\` in languages that use braces for blocks, and means that the phrase grammar does not depend on whether braces or indentation are used. This requires that the lexer hold state, namely the current indentation level, and thus can detect changes in indentation when this changes, and thus the lexical grammar is not context-free ‚Äì INDENT/DEDENT depend on the contextual information of previous indentation level. Alternatives The primary alternative to delimiting blocks, popularized by C, is to ignore whitespace and mark blocks explicitly with curly brackets (i.e., \`{\` and \`}\`) or some other delimiter. While this allows for more freedom ‚Äì the developer might choose not to indent small pieces of code like the break and continue statements ‚Äì sloppily indented code might lead the reader astray. Lisp and other S-expression-based languages do not differentiate statements from expressions, and parentheses are enough to control the scoping of all statements within the language. As in curly bracket languages, whitespace is mostly ignored by the reader (i.e., the read function). Whitespace is used to separate tokens.http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/02_adg.htm The explicit structure of Lisp code allows it to perform automatic indentation, which acts as a visual cue for human Lisp readers. Another alternative is for each block to begin and end with explicit keywords. For example, in ALGOL 60 and its descendant Pascal blocks start with keyword \`begin\` and end with keyword \`end\`. In some languages (but not Pascal), this means that newlines are important (unlike in curly brace languages), but the indentation is not. In BASIC and Fortran, blocks begin with the block name (such as \`IF\`) and end with the block name prepended with \`END\` (e.g., \`END IF\`). In Fortran, each and every block can also have its own unique block name, which adds an additional level of explicitness to lengthy code. ALGOL 68 and the Bourne shell (sh, and bash) are similar, but the ending of the block is usually given by the name of the block written backward (e.g., \`case\` starts a switch statement and it spans until the matching \`esac\`; similarly conditionals \`if\`...\`then\`...[\`elif\`...[\`else\`... \`fi\` or for loops \`for\`...\`do\`...\`od\` in ALGOL68 or \`for\`...\`do\`...\`done\` in bash). An interesting variation on this is made by Modula-2, a Pascal-like language which does away with the difference between one and multiline blocks. This allows the block opener (\`{\` or \`BEGIN\`) to be skipped for all but the function level block, requiring only a block terminating token (\`}\` or \`END\`). It also fixes dangling else. Custom is for the \`end\` token to be placed on the same indentation level as the rest of the block, giving a blockstructure that is very readable. One advantage to the Fortran approach is that it improves readability of long, nested, or otherwise complex code. A group of outdents or closing brackets alone does not provide any contextual cues as to which blocks are being closed, necessitating backtracking, and closer scrutiny while debugging. In addition, languages that allow a suffix for END-like keywords further improve such cues, such as \`continue\` versus \`continue for x\`. However, modern code editing applications often provide visual indicators and features such as folding to assist with these drawbacks.

Work began in 1888 with the construction of three brick surveying towers along the tunnel's proposed line, followed by a vertical shafts to the level of the rails. The Duke of Rutland had decreed that no more than one ventilation shaft should be sunk through his land and that work should cease from August to October, during the grouse shooting season. Four permanent and three temporary shafts were sunk near to the Totley end. The latter were cut through shale, and water was encountered in the first eight feet. The permanent shafts took longer, encountering beds of ganister, coal and rock. As the headings were driven from the base of each shaft, water flow increased to per day ‚Äì equivalent to per second. At the Padley (Grindleford) end, the situation was little better and work stopped for several weeks until a drain was laid. Then at about a spring was encountered which flooded the workings at per hour or per second. A raft was used to inspect the workings. Shortly after this the shale became drier and work proceeded toward Totley, the headings finally meeting in 1892. The tunnel was the proving ground of a number of boring machines for the shot holes, using gelignite to blast the rock. No limit was set on the amount, and in all some were used. The atmosphere in the workings was hot and humid and compressed air used for ventilation. For a time at the Padley end, a turbine was installed in the Burbage Brook to drive a fan. During construction a natural cavern, several hundred feet in area, was discovered and incorporated into the tunnel and a large air shaft was installed to the surface. The entrance to the cavern can be seen on the Up side (towards Sheffield) of the tunnel halfway through. Because of the damp conditions, the workforce suffered outbreaks of typhoid, diphtheria, smallpox and scarlet fever. Accommodation was scarce, and the workers lived often twenty to thirty in a house. Working 24-hour shifts, as soon as one man got out of his bed, another would take his place, with little in the way of washing or sanitary facilities. The tunnel was completed in 1893 and at the time was the second-longest railway tunnel in the UK, the older Severn Tunnel is longer. Passenger services commenced in 1894.Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain, Vol VIII South & West Yorkshire; David Joy; 2nd ed; 1984, David & Charles; Newton Abbot; p. 171 After the two High Speed 1 tunnels opened in 2007, it became the fourth longest mainline railway tunnel in the UK. Because of its length, in addition to the Midland's normal block system, signal wires were installed which, when cut, caused alarms to ring in the signal boxes at each end. The same system was used in the shorter Cowburn and Clay Cross Tunnels. From the Hope Valley towards Totley the tunnel starts level, then falls on gradients of 1 in 150, 1 in 176 and 1 in 100. Present day Totley Tunnel is frequently used by both passenger trains between Sheffield and Manchester and freight lines operating from Hope. The passenger services are Northern who operate a regular stopping service at the Hope Valley stations, Transpennine Express and East Midlands Railway. Above ground, there are a number of ventilation shafts still visible along the Dore and Totley Moss moorland.The Hope Valley Line Dore to Chinley; Ted Hancock; p.112 Several shafts are visible in Dore from Strawberry Lee Road - however safety railings have now been added across the top of the shafts.

Noting that 1887 DNB edition cites February 1731. ‚Äì 4 November 1764), was an English poet and satirist. Early life Churchill was born in Vine Street, Westminster. His father, Rev. Charles Churchill, was rector of Rainham, Essex, held the curacy and lectureship of St Johns, Westminster, from 1733, and Charles was educated at Westminster School, where he became a good classical scholar, and formed a close and lasting friendship with Robert Lloyd. He was admitted to St John's College, Cambridge on 8 July 1748. According to the DNB he was admitted to Trinity College in 1749, but never attended. The DNB refers to a story regarding Churchill's alleged rejection from Merton College, Oxford; this was said to be due to \\"want of classical knowledge\\", although his friends claimed that the cause was Churchill's \\"impertinence\\" in showing contempt for the questions he was asked. The DNB calls this \\"unintelligible\\" in light of Churchill's recognised academic ability, and it was regarded as \\"highly improbable\\" by the ODNB. James Sambrook, ‚ÄòChurchill, Charles (1732‚Äì1764)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Oct 2006, accessed 13 Dec 2009 Churchill contracted a marriage with a Miss Scot within the rules of the Fleet in his eighteenth year, and never lived at Cambridge; the young couple lived in his father's house, and Churchill was afterwards sent to the north of England to prepare for holy orders. He became curate of the church of St Thomas √† Becket in South Cadbury, Somerset, and, on receiving priest's orders (1756), began to act as his father's curate at Rainham. Two years later the elder Churchill died, and the son was elected to succeed him in his curacy and lectureship. His emoluments amounted to less than ¬£100 a year, and he increased his income by teaching in a girls' school. His marriage proved unhappy, and he began to spend much of his time in dissipation in the society of Robert Lloyd. He was separated from his wife in 1761, and would have been imprisoned for debt but for the timely help of Lloyd's father, Pierson Lloyd, who had been an usher and was now second master at Westminster. Career as Satirist Charles Churchill-his portrait was engraved and used by Paul Revere as a fake portrait of Colonel Benjamin Church to illustrate a 1772 edition of Benjamin Church's The Entertaining History of King Philip's War. See . Churchill had already done some work for the booksellers, and his friend Lloyd had had some success with a didactic poem, The Actor. Churchill's knowledge of the theatre was now made use of in the Rosciad, which appeared in March 1761. This reckless and amusing satire described with the most disconcerting accuracy the faults of the various actors and actresses on the London stage; in a competition judged by Shakespeare and Jonson, Garrick is named the greatest English actor. Its immediate popularity was no doubt largely due to its personal character, but its vigour and raciness make it worth reading even now when the objects of Churchill's wit are forgotten. The first impression was published anonymously, and in the Critical Review, conducted by Tobias Smollett, it was confidently asserted that the poem was the joint production of George Colman the Elder, Bonnell Thornton and Robert Lloyd. Churchill immediately published an Apology addressed to the Critical Reviewers, which, after developing the subject that it is only authors who prey on their own kind, repeats the fierce attack on the stage. Incidentally it contains an enthusiastic tribute to John Dryden, of whom Churchill was a devotee. In the Rosciad he had praised Mrs Pritchard, Mrs Cibber and Mrs Clive, but no leading London actor, with the exception of David Garrick, had escaped censure, and in the Apology Garrick was clearly threatened. He deprecated criticism by showing every possible civility to Churchill, who became a terror to the actors. Thomas Davies wrote to Garrick attributing his blundering in the part of Cymbeline \\"to my accidentally seeing Mr Churchill in the pit, it rendering me confused and unmindful of my business.\\" Churchill's satire made him many enemies, and brought reprisals. In Night, an Epistle to Robert Lloyd (1761), he answered the attacks made on him, offering by way of defense the argument that any faults were better than hypocrisy. His scandalous conduct brought down the censure of the dean of Westminster, and in 1763 the protests of his parishioners led him to resign his offices, and he was free to wear his blue coat with metal buttons and much gold lace without remonstrance from the dean. The Rosciad had been refused by several publishers, and was finally published at Churchill's own expense. He received a considerable sum from the sale, and paid his old creditors in full, besides making an allowance to his wife. Friendship with Wilkes The Painter and his Pug A satirical engraving of Wilkes by William Hogarth, who shows him with a demonic-looking wig, crossed eyes, and two editions of his The North Briton: Numbers 17 (in which he attacked, amongst others, Hogarth) and the famous 45. 1763 \\"portrait\\" of Churchill by William Hogarth. In 1761 or 1762 he became a close ally and friend with the champion of liberty of the press John Wilkes, whom he regularly assisted with The North Briton weekly newspaper. His collaboration with Wilkes thereafter earned him an honourable place in the history of parliamentary democracy and civil liberties. His next poem, The Prophecy of Famine: A Scots Pastoral (1763), was founded on a paper written originally for The North Briton. This violent satire on Scottish influence fell in with the current hatred of Lord Bute, and the Scottish place-hunters were as much alarmed as the actors had been. When Wilkes was arrested he gave Churchill a timely hint to retire to the country for a time, the publisher, Kearsley, having stated that he received part of the profits from the paper. His Epistle to William Hogarth (1763) was in answer to the caricature of Wilkes made during the trial, in it Hogarth's vanity and envy were attacked in an invective which Garrick quoted as shocking and barbarous. Hogarth retaliated with an engraving based on The Painter and his Pug, which caricatures Churchill as a bear in torn clerical bands hugging a pot of porter and a club made of lies and North Britons, while Hogarth's pug Trump urinates on Churchill's Epistle. The Duellist (1763) is a virulent satire on the most active opponents of Wilkes in the House of Lords, especially on Bishop Warburton. He attacked Dr Johnson among others in The Ghost as \\"Pomposo, insolent and loud, Vain idol of a scribbling crowd\\". Other poems are The Conference (1763); The Author (1763), highly praised by Churchill's contemporaries; Gotham (1764), a poem on the duties of a king, didactic rather than satiric in tone; The Candidate (1764), a satire on John Montagu, fourth earl of Sandwich, one of Wilkes's bitterest enemies, whom he had already denounced for his treachery in The Duellist (Bk. iii.) as too infamous to have a friend; The Farewell (1764); The Times (1764); Independence, and an unfinished Journey. Death and legacy In October 1764 he went to Boulogne to join Wilkes. There he was attacked by a fever of which he died on 4 November. He left his property to his two sons, and made Wilkes his literary executor with full powers. Wilkes did little. He wrote an epitaph for his friend and about half a dozen notes on his poems, and Andrew Kippis acknowledges some slight assistance from him in preparing his life of Churchill for the Biographia (1780). There is more than one instance of Churchill's generosity to his friends. In 1763 he found his friend Robert Lloyd in prison for debt. He paid a guinea a week for his better maintenance in the Fleet, and raised a subscription to set him free. Lloyd fell ill on receipt of the news of Churchill's death, and died shortly afterwards. Churchill's sister Patty, who was engaged to Lloyd, did not long survive them. William Cowper was his schoolfellow, and left many kindly references to him. A partial collection of Churchill's poems appeared in 1763. References Sources * The Poetical Works of Charles Churchill. Edited with an introduction and notes by Douglas Grant.

One of the most prolific artists active in the last decades of the Ancien R√©gime, Fragonard produced more than 550 paintings (not counting drawings and etchings), of which only five are dated. Among his most popular works are genre paintings conveying an atmosphere of intimacy and veiled eroticism. Biography Statue of Fragonard in Grasse, his birthplace Jean-Honor√© Fragonard, Blindman's Buff, 1775‚Äì1780, Timken Museum of Art, San Diego Jean- Honor√© Fragonard was born at Grasse, Alpes-Maritimes, the son of Fran√ßois Fragonard, a glover, and Fran√ßoise Petit. Fragonard was articled to a Paris notary when his father's circumstances became strained through unsuccessful speculations, but showed such talent and inclination for art that he was taken at the age of eighteen to Fran√ßois Boucher. Boucher recognized the youth's rare gifts but, disinclined to waste his time with one so inexperienced, sent him to Chardin's atelier. Fragonard studied for six months under the great luminist, then returned more fully equipped to Boucher, whose style he soon acquired so completely that the master entrusted him with the execution of replicas of his paintings. Though not yet a student of the Academy, Fragonard gained the Prix de Rome in 1752 with a painting of Jeroboam Sacrificing to the Golden Calf, but before proceeding to Rome he continued to study for three years under Charles-Andr√© van Loo. In the year preceding his departure he painted the Christ washing the Feet of the Apostles now at Grasse Cathedral. On 17 September 1756, he took up his abode at the French Academy in Rome, then presided over by Charles-Joseph Natoire. While at Rome, Fragonard contracted a friendship with a fellow painter, Hubert Robert. In 1760, they toured Italy together, executing numerous sketches of local scenery. It was in these romantic gardens, with their fountains, grottos, temples and terraces, that Fragonard conceived the dreams which he was subsequently to render in his art. He also learned to admire the masters of the Dutch and Flemish schools (Rubens, Hals, Rembrandt, Ruisdael), imitating their loose and vigorous brushstrokes. Added to this influence was the deep impression made upon his mind by the florid sumptuousness of Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, whose works he had an opportunity to study in Venice before he returned to Paris in 1761. In 1765 his Coresus et Callirhoe secured his admission to the Academy. It was made the subject of a pompous (though not wholly serious) eulogy by Diderot, and was bought by the king, who had it reproduced at the Gobelins factory. Hitherto Fragonard had hesitated between religious, classic and other subjects; but now the demand of the wealthy art patrons of Louis XV's pleasure-loving and licentious court turned him definitely towards those scenes of love and voluptuousness with which his name will ever be associated, and which are only made acceptable by the tender beauty of his color and the virtuosity of his facile brushwork; such works include the Blind Man's Bluff (Le collin maillard), Serment d'amour (Love Vow), Le Verrou (The Bolt), La Culbute (The Tumble), La Chemise enlev√©e (The Shirt Removed), and L'escarpolette (The Swing, Wallace Collection), and his decorations for the apartments of Mme du Barry and the dancer Madeleine Guimard. The portrait of Denis Diderot (1769) has recently had its attribution to Fragonard called into question. Early engraving of Jean-Honor√© Fragonard. Titled Chaumi√©re Italienne. A lukewarm response to these series of ambitious works induced Fragonard to abandon Rococo and to experiment with Neoclassicism. He married Marie-Anne G√©rard, herself a painter of miniatures, (1745‚Äì1823) on 17 June 1769 and had a daughter, Rosalie Fragonard (1769‚Äì1788), who became one of his favourite models. In October 1773, he again went to Italy with Pierre-Jacques On√©zyme Bergeret de Grancourt and his son, Pierre-Jacques Bergeret de Grancourt. In September 1774, he returned through Vienna, Prague, Dresden, Frankfurt and Strasbourg. Back in Paris Marguerite G√©rard, his wife's 14-year- old sister, became his student and assistant in 1778. In 1780, he had a son, Alexandre-√âvariste Fragonard (1780‚Äì1850), who eventually became a talented painter and sculptor. The French Revolution deprived Fragonard of his private patrons: they were either guillotined or exiled. The neglected painter deemed it prudent to leave Paris in 1790 and found shelter in the house of his cousin Alexandre Maubert at Grasse, which he decorated with the series of decorative panels known as the Les progr√®s de l'amour dans le c≈ìur d'une jeune fille,Also known as \\"Roman d'amour de la jeunesse\\". originally painted for Ch√¢teau du Barry. The Swing (French: ), 1767, Wallace Collection, London. Fragonard returned to Paris early in the nineteenth century, where he died in 1806, almost completely forgotten.  Reputation  For half a century or more he was so completely ignored that Wilhelm L√ºbke's 1873 art history volume omits the very mention of his name. Subsequent reevaluation has confirmed his position among the all-time masters of French painting. The influence of Fragonard's handling of local colour and expressive, confident brushstroke on the Impressionists (particularly his grand niece, Berthe Morisot, and Renoir) cannot be overestimated. Fragonard's paintings, alongside those of Fran√ßois Boucher, seem to sum up an era.\\"Fragonard, Jean-Honor√©\\", WebMuseum, Paris. Retrieved 22 June 2014. One of Fragonard's most renowned paintings is The Swing, also known as The Happy Accidents of the Swing (its original title), an oil painting in the Wallace Collection in London. It is considered to be one of the masterpieces of the rococo era, and is Fragonard's best known work.Ingamells, John, The Wallace Collection, Catalogue of Pictures, Vol III, French before 1815, 165, Wallace Collection, 1989, , The painting portrays a young gentleman concealed in the bushes, observing a lady on swing being pushed by her spouse, who is standing in the background, hidden in the shadows, as he is unaware of the affair. As the lady swings forward, the young man gets a glimpse under her dress. According to Charles Coll√©'s memoirs a young nobleman Although his identity was not unveiled by Coll√©, it has been thought that it was Marie-Fran√ßois-David Bollioud de Saint-Julien, baron of Argental (1713‚Äì1788), best known as Baron de Saint-Julien, the then Receiver General of the French Clergy. However there is little evidence for this, according to Ingamells, 163‚Äì164. had requested this portrait of his mistress seated on a swing. He asked first Gabriel Fran√ßois Doyen to make this painting of him and his mistress. Not comfortable with this frivolous work, Doyen refused and passed on the commission to Fragonard.

Anund meaning trail- blazer Anund or Anund the Land Clearer; alternate names Br√∏t-Anundr (Old East Norse) or Braut-√ñnundr (Old West Norse) was a semi-legendary Swedish king of the House of Yngling who reigned in the mid-seventh century. The name would have been Proto-Norse *Anuwinduz meaning \\"winning ancestor\\".(Lexicon of Nordic personal names before the 8th century) History In his Ynglinga saga, Snorri Sturluson relates that Anund succeeded his father King Yngvar who fell in battle with the Estonians. After his father's wars against Danish Vikings and Estonian Vikings, peace reigned over Sweden and there were good harvests. Anund was a popular king who became very rich, not only because of the peace and the good harvests but also because he avenged his father in Estonia. That country was ravaged far and wide and in the autumn Anund returned with great riches. In those days Sweden was dominated by vast and uninhabited forests, so Anund started making roads and clearing land and vast districts were settled by Swedes. Consequently, he was named Br√∂t-Anund. He made a farm for himself in every district and used to stay as a guest in many homes. One autumn, King Anund was travelling between his halls (see Husbys) and came to a place called Himinhei√∞r (sky heath) between two mountains. He was surprised by a landslide which killed him. After presenting this story of Anund, Snorri Sturluson quotes √ûj√≥√∞√≥lfr of Hvinir's Ynglingatal: {  :Var√∞ √ñnundr :J√≥nakrs bura :harmi heptr :und Himinfj√∂llum, :ok ofv√¶g :Eistra d√≥lgi :heipt hr√≠sungs :at hendi kom; :ok s√° fr√∂mu√∞r :foldar beinum :H√∂gna hr√∂rs :um horfinn var.  :We all have heard how Jonkur's sons, :Whom weapons could not touch, with stones :Were stoned to death in open day, :King Onund died in the same way. :Or else perhaps the wood-grown land, :Which long had felt his conquering hand, :Uprose at length in deadly strife, :And pressed out Onund's hated life.  } The Historia Norwegi√¶ presents a Latin summary of Ynglingatal, older than Snorri's quotation (continuing after Ingvar): {  Iste ergo genuit Broutonund, quem Sigwardus frater suus occidit in Himinheithi,Storm informs that he has corrected the name to Himinheithi (sky fields) in his edition, instead of the original Himinherthy. quod loci vocabulum interpretatur coeli campus.

Museum Tusculanum Press. , p. 79.  } The original text of Ynglingatal is hard to interpret, and it only says that Anund died und Himinfj√∂llum (under the sky mountains) and that stones were implied. According to Historia Norwegi√¶, he was murdered by his brother Sigvard in Himinherthy (which the source says means \\"the fields of the sky\\", c≈ìli campus. Such a place name is not known and Swedish archaeologist Birger Nerman (1888‚Äì1971) suggests that the original place of death was under the sky mountains, i.e. under the clouds (cf. the etymology of cloud). Consequently, he may have been killed outdoors, by his brother and with a stone. In the translation above, Laing has made the same interpretation as Nerman. Thorsteins saga V√≠kingssonar says that Anund was not the son of Ingvar, but the son of his grandfather √ñsten. It also relates that he had a brother named Olaf who was the king of Fjordane.

As was common practice at the time, settlers cleared land using the slash and burn method. That summer, there was little rain and the forests and underbrush burned easily. In the days leading up to July 29, several smaller fires that had been purposely set merged into a single large firestorm. It was huge; at times its front measured across. The fire moved uncontrollably upon the towns of Porquis Junction, Iroquois Falls, Kelso, Nushka, Matheson, and Ramore - destroying them completely - while causing extensive damage to Homer and Monteith. A separate fire burned in and around Cochrane. In all, the fires burned an area of approximately . Because of forest fire smoke that had covered the region for several weeks and the absence of a forest fire monitoring service, there was almost no warning that the conflagration was upon the communities. Some people escaped on the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway (now the Ontario Northland Railway), while others were saved by wading into the nearby Black River or one of the small lakes in the area. 223 people were killed according to the official estimate. The Matheson Fire led to the creation of the Forest Protection Branch of the Department of Lands, Forests and Mines (now known as the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry) and the Forest Fires Prevention Act in Ontario.http://www.ontarioforesthistory.ca/files/fhso_newsl_vol_4_iss_1_spring_2013.pdf The great fires are the subject of the books Killer in the Bush by Michael Barnes, and Il pleuvait des oiseaux by Jocelyne Saucier.Barnes: Killer in the Bush: the Great Fires of Northeastern Ontario. 2nd edition, 2004.

The municipality is astride the Black River, for which it is partly named. The Matheson railway station was serviced by the Northlander until 2012. Matheson was first known as McDougall's Chute after an early trapper. Renamed for Arthur J. Matheson (1842-1913), provincial Treasurer and M.P.P. for South Lanark. Became part of Timmins on January 1, 1973. Mining, forestry and farming are some of the principal industries in the area, augmented by outdoor tourism in the summer, such as fishing and hunting. There are three elementary schools within the municipality. Communities The communities in the township are Holtyre, Matheson, Ramore, Shillington, Val Gagn√© and Wavell. The main community of Matheson is located at the intersection of highways 11 and 101. History Prospecting started in 1909. The Croesus Mine (1914-1918) became \\"one of the richest mines in Canada,\\" according to Barnes. Gold was like \\"plums in pudding\\" and \\"one gold nugget was egg shaped, two inches long and one and a quarter across.\\" A total of 16 companies operated in the Harker Holloway area from 1917 to 1925, including Harker Gold Mines. P.A. McDermott found a gold-bearing zone in 1922, which became American Barrick's Holt-McDermott Mine in 1988. Located in the Abitibi greenstone belt, the mine produced 60,000 ounces of gold in 1994. The Great Fire of 1916 left 243 dead.

The family became the subject of media attention and scrutiny through the activities of one of its members, Osama bin Laden, the former head of al-Qaeda. Beginnings The family traces its origins to Awad bin Laden from the village of al-Rubat, in the Wadi Doan of the Tarim Valley, Hadramout governorate, Yemen. His son was Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden (died 1967). Mohammed bin Laden was a native of the Shafi'i (Sunni) Hadhramaut coast in southern Yemen, and emigrated to Saudi Arabia prior to World War I. He set up a construction company and came to Abdul Aziz ibn Saud's attention through construction projects, later being awarded contracts for major renovations in Mecca. He made his initial fortune from exclusive rights to construct all mosques and other religious buildings not only in Saudi Arabia, but as far as Ibn Saud's influence reached. Until his death, Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden had exclusive control over restorations at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. Soon, the bin Laden corporate network extended far beyond construction sites. Mohammed's special intimacy with the monarchy was inherited by the younger bin Laden generation. Mohammed's sons attended Victoria College, Alexandria, Egypt. Their schoolmates included King Hussein of Jordan, Zaid Al Rifai, the Kashoggi brothers (whose father was one of the king's physicians), Kamal Adham (who ran the General Intelligence Directorate under King Faisal), present-day contractors Mohammed Al Attas, Fahd Shobokshi, Ghassan Sakr, and actor Omar Sharif. When Mohammed bin Laden died in 1967, his son Salem bin Laden took over the family enterprises, until his own accidental death in 1988. Family members American and European intelligence officials estimate that all the relatives of the family may number as many as 600. In 1994, the bin Laden family disowned Osama bin Laden, and the Saudi government revoked his passport.bin Laden, Osama. The History Channel website. Retrieved on 8 April 2007. The Saudi government also stripped Osama of his citizenship for publicly speaking out against the government for permitting U.S. troops to be based in Saudi Arabia in preparation for the 1991 Gulf War. The groupings of the bin Laden family, based on the nationalities of the wives, include the most prominent \\"Saudi group\\", a \\"Syrian group\\", a \\"Lebanese group,\\" and an \\"Egyptian group\\". The Egyptian group employs 40,000 people, most likely the country's largest private foreign investor. Osama bin Laden was born the only son of Muhammed bin Laden's eleventh wife, Hamida al-Attas, who was of Syrian origin, making Osama a member of the Syrian group. =First Generation= * Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden (born 1908 in Hadhramaut) is the family patriarch; before World War I, Mohammed, originally poor and uneducated, emigrated from Hadhramaut, on the south coast of Yemen, to the Red Sea port of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where he began to work as a porter. Starting his own business in 1930, Mohammed built his fortune as a building contractor for the Saudi royal family during the 1950s. Married 22 times, with 54 children, his 17th child was Osama bin Laden, who was the son of Hamida al-Attas (born in Syria), Mohammed's eleventh wife. The couple divorced soon after Osama was born, and Hamida was given in marriage to one of the executives of Mohammed's company around 1958. In 1967, Mohammed was killed in an airplane crash in Saudi Arabia when his pilot misjudged a landing. * Muhammad al-Attas is Osama's stepfather in whose household Osama was raised at Jeddah, and worked at the bin Laden company. The couple had four children in addition to Osama: three boys and a girl, Fatima Mohammed al-Attas. *Abdallah bin Laden is the brother of Mohammed and the uncle of Osama; headed the Saudi Binladin Group (SBG); died in Medina, March 21, 2002, at age 75. He also had over 60 children and was married 6 times. =Second Generation= * Salem bin Laden (1946-1988) attended Millfield, the English boarding school. He took over the family empire in 1967 upon the death of his father; also an amateur rock guitarist in the 1970s. He married an English art student, Caroline Carey, whose half-brother, Ambrose, is the son of the Marquess of Queensberry. He died outside San Antonio, Texas in 1988, when an experimental ultralight plane that he was flying got tangled in power lines. * Tarek bin Laden (born 1947); once called \\"the personification of the dichotomy (conservatism and change) of Saudi Arabia.\\" * Bakr bin Laden (born 1946) succeeded Salem as the chairman of the Saudi Binladin Group; major power broker in Jeddah. * Hassan bin Laden, senior vice president of the SBG. * Yehia bin Laden, also active in the SBG; in 2001, owned 16 percent of Cambridge, MA-based Hybridon, Inc. * Mahrous bin Laden, implicated in the Grand Mosque Seizure carried out by dissidents against the Saudi ruling family at the Masjid al-Haram in Makka on November 20, 1979. This event shook the Muslim world with the ensuing violence and the killing of hundreds at the holiest of Islamic sites. Trucks owned by the family were reported to have been used to smuggle arms into the tightly controlled city. The bin Laden connection was through the son of a Sultan of Yemen who had been radicalized by Syrian members of the Muslim Brotherhood. Mahrous was arrested for a time, but in the Saudi government response, he was not beheaded along with 63 others who were, their public executions broadcast live on Saudi television. Later exonerated, he joined the family business and became manager of the Medina branch of the bin Laden enterprises and a member of the board. * Osama bin Laden (born 1957 in Saudi Arabia, died May 2, 2011, in Pakistan) planned the September 11 attacks against the United States. Death announced on May 2, 2011. He was one of the FBI Most Wanted Terrorists. * Najwa Ghanem (born 1959), Osama married his first wife in 1974. A first cousin, she was his mother's niece. She co-authored Growing Up bin Laden with her son Omar. * (Shaikha) Mohammed bin Laden (born 1960), half-sister of Osama, married Mohammed Jamal Khalifa. He was the founder of Benevolence International Foundation, in the Philippines in 1988. During this period, Khalifa is believed to have received large donations of cash from outside the country, some of which, intelligence officials suspect, may have been funneled to him by Al-Qaeda. He also ran the International Relations and Information Centre, by which embezzled money was funneled to Ramzi Yousef. In 1993, his business cards were found in the Jersey City, New Jersey apartment that Yousef stayed in while he was involved with the 1993 World Trade Centre bombing plot. Khalifa was first arrested on December 14, 1994, in Mountain View, California, placed in solitary confinement, and the contents of his luggage were logged and edited. In 1995, Khalifa was arrested in San Francisco on charges of violating United States immigration laws. He was detained while the Justice Department tried but failed to gather enough information to charge him in connection with suspected terrorist activities. Eventually, he was deported on May 5, 1995, to Jordan, which had an outstanding warrant for him on charges stemming from the bombing of movie theaters in Amman in 1994, for which he had been under a possible death sentence, convicted in absentia. His conviction was later overturned in a new trial, which resulted in an acquittal. In 1996, Khalifa returned to Saudi Arabia, where he was again arrested after 9/11, but later released. He lived in Saudi Arabia and was assassinated in 2007 in Madagascar. * Yeslam bin Ladin (born 1950) studied in the 1970s at the University of Southern California, in Los Angeles; settled in Switzerland; became a Swiss citizen in 2001; Geneva-based head of the family's European holding company, the Saudi Investment Company; was scrutinized by Swiss and American investigators because of a financial stake he has in a Swiss aviation firm; he has claimed to not have had contact with Osama since 1981 * Abdullah bin Laden (born 1965); graduate of Harvard Law School; lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts on 9/11, the only Bin Ladin relative to remain in the United States, he stayed in Boston for almost a month following the attacks. * Shafig bin Laden, half-brother of Osama, was a guest of honour at the Carlyle Group's Washington conference at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel on September 11, 2001, and among the 13 members of the bin Ladin family to leave the United States on September 19, 2001 aboard N521DB. =Third Generation= * Wafah Dufour (born 1975), daughter of Yeslam bin Laden, is an American model and aspiring singer- songwriter. She spent the early part of her life in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Dufour, her little sisters Najia (1979) and Noor (1987), her mother (1954) and her father (1950) then moved to Geneva, Switzerland. In 1988, her parents separated. She earned a law diploma at Geneva Law School (Switzerland) and later a master's degree from Columbia Law School in the United States. She lived in Manhattan until around the time of the September 11, 2001 attacks, but was staying in Geneva for a summer holiday at the time of the attacks. * Abdulla Osama bin Laden (born 1976), son of Osama and Najwa. He is reportedly residing in Saudi Arabia, and runs his own firm, called Fame Advertising, in Jeddah; he is closely watched by the Saudi government, which has restricted his travel from the kingdom since 1996; reportedly, he has never disowned his father. * Saad bin Laden (1979-2009) son of Osama and Najwa; Saad accompanied Osama on his exile to Sudan from 1991 to 1996, and then to Afghanistan. He was believed to be married to a woman from Yemen. Saad reportedly arrived in Iran in 2002 from Afghanistan, with a fake Iranian passport using the name Saad Mahmoudian. The customs officer immediately recognized that the passport was fake, and searched and questioned Saad briefly. He notified airport security but did not notify the Ministry of Intelligence and National Security of Iran (which is also responsible for identifying detained people at airports) as he was supposed to. As a result, the officer found nothing suspicious about his entrance and permitted him to leave Tehran. He was believed to have been heavily responsible for the bombing of a Tunisian synagogue on April 11, 2002. He was then implicated in the May 12, 2003, suicide bombing in Riyadh, and the Morocco bombing four days later. He was put under house arrest by the Iran government, but later escaped by January 2009 and fled to Pakistan. Saad was later killed in a US drone strike in 2009. Al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri confirmed Saad's death in a videotape three years later. * Omar bin Laden (born 1981) son of Osama and Najwa; Omar accompanied Osama on his exile to Sudan from 1991 to 1996, and then to Afghanistan. He returned to Saudi Arabia after an apparent falling-out with his father over Omar's disagreement with violence. For a while, Omar ran his own company in Jeddah as a contractor. Omar has one son, Ahmed, by his ex-wife, whom he had divorced 3 times by 2006. In September 2006, he married Zaina and they are now said to be living in a secret location in Qatar. * Mohammad bin Osama bin Laden (born 1983), son of Osama and Najwa, married the daughter of al-Qaeda leader Mohammed Atef in January 2001, at Kandahar, Afghanistan, with footage broadcast by Al-Jazeera, where three of Osama's step-siblings and Osama's mother were in attendance. * Hamza bin Laden (1989 - 2017/2019), son of Osama. Was being groomed to be Osama's heir following Saad's death. On February 28, 2019, the U.S. State Department offered a reward of up to $1 million for information on Hamza bin Laden's whereabouts. The announcement described Hamza bin Laden as a ‚Äúkey leader‚Äù of Al-Qaeda who had released audio and video messages on the internet calling for attacks on the U.S. and its western allies to avenge his father's killing. On July 31, 2019, it was reported that Hamza bin Laden was believed to have been killed in the first two years of the Trump administration, which began on January 20, 2017. On September 14, 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed that Hamza bin Laden was killed in a U.S. counter-terrorism operation in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region. Other details were not disclosed. * Khaled bin Laden, son of Osama. Killed along with his father at Abbottabad, Pakistan, May 2, 2011. * Abdul Aziz bin Laden, manages SBG's Egyptian operations; ranked Number 2 in the 2006 UAE National Superstock Bike Championship.

The passenger list was made public by Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), who obtained the manifest from officials at Boston's Logan International Airport. None of the flights, domestic or international, took place before the reopening of national airspace on the morning of Sept. 13 and the 9/11 Commission found \\"no evidence of a political intervention\\". Among the passengers with the bin Laden surname were Omar Awad bin Laden, who had lived with Osama's nephew Abdallah Awad bin Laden, who was involved in forming the U.S. branch of the World Assembly of Muslim Youth in Alexandria, and Shafig bin Laden, a half brother of Osama's who was reportedly attending the annual investor conference of the Carlyle Group. Also on board was Akberali Moawalla, an official with the investment company run by Yeslam bin Ladin, another of Osama bin Laden's half brothers. Records show that a passenger, Kholoud Kurdi, lived in Northern Virginia with a bin Laden relative. The bin Laden flight has received fresh publicity because it was a topic in Michael Moore's controversial documentary Fahrenheit 9/11. The 9/11 Commission found that the \\"FBI conducted a satisfactory screening of Saudi nationals who left the United States on charter flights. The Saudi government was advised of and agreed to the FBI's requirements that passengers be identified and checked against various databases before the flights departed. The Federal Aviation Administration representative working in the FBI operations center made sure that the FBI was aware of the flights of Saudi nationals and was able to screen the passengers before they were allowed to depart.\\" References Further reading Bin Laden's daughter free to leave Tehran: Iran FM (AFP December 25, 2009) Saudi Arabian families ","title":"Bin Laden family"},{"id":"605676","text":"Them! is a 1954 American black-and-white science fiction monster film from Warner Bros. Pictures, produced by David Weisbart, directed by Gordon Douglas, and starring James Whitmore, Edmund Gwenn, Joan Weldon, and James Arness. The film is based on an original story treatment by George Worthing Yates, which was then developed into a screenplay by Ted Sherdeman and adaptation by Russell Hughes. Them! is one of the first of the 1950s \\"nuclear monster\\" films, and the first \\"big bug\\" feature. A nest of gigantic irradiated ants is discovered in the New Mexico desert; they quickly become a national threat when it is discovered that two young queen ants and their consorts have escaped to establish new nests. The national search that follows finally culminates in a battle with Them in the concrete spillways and storm drain system of Los Angeles. Plot New Mexico State Police Sgt. Ben Peterson and Trooper Ed Blackburn discover a little girl wandering the desert, near Alamogordo, in shock and in a catatonic state. They take her to a nearby vacation trailer, located by a spotter aircraft, where they find evidence that the little girl had been there when it was attacked and nearly destroyed. It is later discovered that the trailer was owned by an FBI Special Agent named Ellinson, on vacation with his wife, son, and daughter; the other members of the girl's family remain missing. Now in an ambulance, the child briefly reacts to a pulsating high-pitched sound from the desert by sitting up in the stretcher. No one else notices her reaction, and she lies back down when the noise stops. At a general store owned by \\"Gramps\\" Johnson, Peterson and Blackburn find him dead and a wall of the store partially torn out. After a quick look-around, Peterson leaves Blackburn behind to secure the crime scene. Blackburn later goes outside to investigate a strange, pulsating sound. Gun shots are fired, the sound grows faster and louder, and Blackburn goes missing. Peterson's chief later points out that both Johnson and Blackburn had fired their weapons at their attacker. More puzzling is the coroner's report on Johnson's brutal death, which includes a huge amount of formic acid found in his body. The FBI sends Special Agent Robert Graham to New Mexico to investigate. After a strange footprint is found near the Ellisons' trailer, the Department of Agriculture sends myrmecologists Dr. Harold Medford (Edmund Gwenn) and his daughter, Dr. Pat Medford, to assist in the investigation. The elder Medford exposes the Ellinson girl to formic acid fumes, which rips her from her catatonia into a state of panic from \\"Them!\\" Medford's suspicions of camponotus vicinus are validated by her reaction, but he will not reveal his theory prematurely. At the Ellinson campsite, Pat encounters a giant, eight- foot-long foraging ant. Following instructions from the elder Medford, Peterson and Graham shoot off the ant's antennae, blinding it, and kill it using a Thompson submachine gun. Medford reveals his theory: a colony of giant ants, mutated by radiation from the first atomic bomb test near Alamogordo, is responsible for the deaths. General O'Brien orders an Army helicopter search, and the ants' nest is found. Cyanide gas bombs are tossed inside, and Graham, Peterson, and Pat descend into the nest to check for survivors. Deep inside, Pat finds evidence that two queen ants have hatched and escaped to establish new colonies. Peterson, Graham, and the Medfords join a government task force which covertly begins to investigate reports of unusual activity. In one a civilian pilot (Fess Parker) has been committed to a mental hospital after claiming that he was forced down by UFOs shaped like giant ants. Next, the Coast Guard receives a report of a giant queen hatching her brood in the hold of a freighter at sea in the Pacific; giant ants attack the ship's crew, and there are few survivors. The freighter is later sunk by U.S. Navy gunfire. A third report about a large sugar theft at a rail yard leads Peterson, Graham, and Major Kibbee to Los Angeles. An alcoholic (Olin Howland) in a hospital \\"drunk tank\\" claims he has seen giant ants outside his window. The mutilated body of a father is recovered, but his two young sons are missing. Peterson, Graham, and Kibbee find evidence that they were flying a model airplane in the Los Angeles River drainage channel near the hospital. Martial law is declared in Los Angeles, and troops are assigned to find the ant nest in the vast storm drain system under the city. Peterson finds the two missing boys alive, trapped by the ants near the nest. He calls for reinforcements and lifts both boys to safety, just before being attacked and grabbed by an ant in its mandibles. Graham arrives with reinforcements and kills the ant, but Peterson dies from his injuries as others swarm to protect the nearby nest. Graham and the soldiers fight off the ants, but a tunnel collapse traps Graham. Several ants charge, but he is able to hold them off with his submachine gun just long enough for troops to break through. The queen and her hatchlings are discovered and quickly destroyed with flamethrowers. Dr. Medford offers a philosophic observation: \\"When Man entered the Atomic Age, he opened the door to a new world. What we may eventually find in that new world, nobody can predict\\".

Disney, however, was more impressed by a scene with Fess Parker as an inmate in the mental ward of the Texas hospital. Watching Parker's performance, Disney realized he had found his Davy Crockett.Smith 2012, p. 167. John Wayne saw the film and, impressed with Arness' performance, recommended him for the role of Marshal Matt Dillon in the new Gunsmoke TV series, a role that Arness went on to play from 1955 to 1975. Production Opening title card with the background in black-and-white and Them! in red-and-blue. When Them! began production in the fall of 1953, it was originally conceived to be in 3D and Warner Color. During pre-production, tests shots in color and 3D were made. A few color tests of the large-scale ant models were also made, but when it was time to shoot the 3D test, Warner Bros.' \\"All Media\\" 3D camera rig malfunctioned and no footage could be filmed. The next day a memo was sent out that the color and 3D aspects of the production were to be scrapped; widescreen black-and-white would now be the film's presentation format. Warner Bros. hoped to emulate the \\"effective shock treatment\\" effect of its previous science fiction thriller The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms; ultimately, however, the film was never made in widescreen. Because of the preparation of certain scenes, many of the camera set-ups for 3D still remain in the film, like the opening titles and the flamethrowers shots aimed directly at the camera.Herzberg 2007, p. 176. Although Warner Bros. was dissatisfied with the color results, the film's titles were printed in a vivid red-and-blue against a black-and-white background in order to give the film's opening a dramatic \\"punch\\". This effect was achieved by an Eastman Color section spliced into each release print. The 1985 VHS tape release, the subsequent LaserDisc and later DVD release have retained this black-and-white-with-two-color title effect. The entrance to the ants' final nest was filmed along the concrete spillways of the Los Angeles River, between the First and Seventh Street Bridges, east of downtown. The depiction of the Chihuahuan Desert of southern New Mexico is actually the Mojave Desert near Palmdale, California. Mercy Hospital was a real institution and is now Brownsville Medical Center. James Whitmore wore \\"lifts\\" in his shoes to compensate for the height difference between himself and James Arness. Whitmore also employed bits of \\"business\\" (hand gestures and motions) during scenes in which he appeared in order to draw more attention to his character when not speaking. The Wilhelm scream, created three years earlier for the film Distant Drums, is used during the action sequences: when a sailor aboard the freighter is grabbed by an ant, when James Whitmore's character is caught in an ant's mandibles, and when an overhead wooden beam falls on a soldier in the Los Angeles storm drain sequence. The giant ants, painted a purplish-green color, were constructed and operated by unseen technicians supervised by Ralph Ayers. During the climactic battle sequence in the Los Angeles sewers, there is a brief shot of one ant moving in the foreground with its side removed, revealing its mechanical interior.Warren 1982, pp. 188‚Äì195. This blunder has been obscured in the DVD releases of the film. The film poster shows a gigantic ant with menacing human-like eyes rather than the normal compound eyes of an ant. The sounds the giant ants emit in the film were the calls of bird-voiced tree frogs mixed in with the calls of a wood thrush, hooded warbler, and red-bellied woodpecker.

The review commented on the cast as \\"like most science-fiction, [the film] is on the whole serviceably rather than excitingly cast\\" and the crew was noted, stating the direction was \\"smoothly machined\\" and the film has \\"decent writing\\" though \\"more short cuts might have been [taken]\\", finding that the start of the film was too slow.

The New York Times, July 25, 1915, p. 15 (December 2, 1879 ‚Äì November 12, 1972) was a Czech-born composer of operettas, musicals, songs and piano pieces, as well as a pianist. After musical training and a brief performing career in his native Prague, Friml moved to the United States, where he became a composer. His best-known works are Rose-Marie and The Vagabond King, each of which enjoyed success on Broadway and in London and were adapted for film. Early life Friml was born Rudolf Anton√≠n Frymel on December 2, 1879 in Star√© Mƒõsto 445, Prague, Bohemia (then part of the Austro- Hungarian empire) and was baptized Catholic at the Kostel svat√©ho Jilj√≠. Friml showed aptitude for music at an early age. He entered the Prague Conservatory in 1895, where he studied the piano and composition with Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k.Everett, p. 3 Friml was expelled from the conservatory in 1901 for performing without permission.Everett, p. 4 In Prague and later in America he composed and published songs, piano pieces and other music, including the prize-winning set of songs, P√≠snƒõ Z√°vi≈°ovy. The last of these, Za tich√Ωch noc√≠, later became the basis for a famous film in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia in 1941. After the conservatory, Friml took a position as accompanist to the violinist Jan Kubel√≠k. He toured with Kubelik twice in the United States (1901‚Äì02 and 1904) and moved there permanently in 1906, apparently with the support of the Czech singer Emmy Destinn. His first regular post in New York was as a repetiteur at the Metropolitan Opera, but he had made his American piano debut at Carnegie Hall on November 17, 1904, giving the premiere of his Piano Concerto in B-flat major with the New York Symphony, under the baton of Walter Damrosch, in a concert that also included Friml playing his own Etude de concert, Op. 4, Smetana's \\"Am Seegestade\\", Liszt's Liebestr√§ume No. 3, the Grieg A minor piano concerto with the orchestra, and a solo improvisation.\\"1904 Nov 17 / Special / Damrosch\\", New York Philharmonic, accessed June 14, 2020 He later settled for a brief time in Los Angeles where he married Mathilde Baruch (1909). They had two children, Charles Rudolf (Jr.) (1910) and Marie Lucille (1911). His second marriage was to Blanch Betters, an actress who had appeared in the chorus of Friml's musical Katinka; his third was to actress Elsie Lawson (who played the maid in Friml's Glorianna, and by whom he had a son, William); and his fourth and final marriage was to Kay Wong Ling. The first three marriages ended in divorce.Everett, pp. 93‚Äì94 The Firefly and early operettas One of the most popular theatrical forms in the early decades of the 20th century in America was the operetta, and its most famous composer was Irish-born Victor Herbert. It was announced in 1912 that operetta diva Emma Trentini would be starring in a new operetta on Broadway by Herbert with lyricist Otto Harbach entitled The Firefly. Shortly before the writing of the operetta, Trentini appeared in a special performance of Herbert's Naughty Marietta conducted by Herbert himself. When Trentini refused to sing \\"Italian Street Song\\" for the encore, an enraged Herbert stormed out of the orchestra pit refusing any further work with Trentini. Arthur Hammerstein, the operetta's sponsor, frantically began to search for another composer. Not finding any other theatre composer who could compose as well as Herbert, Hammerstein settled on the almost unknown Friml because of his classical training. After a month of work, Friml produced the score for what would be his first theatrical success.Bloom, Ken. Broadway: its history, people, and places: an encyclopedia. (1991; Taylor & Francis, 2004), p. 174 After tryouts in Syracuse, New York, The Firefly opened at the Lyric Theatre on December 2, 1912 to a warm reception by both the audience and the critics. The production moved to the Casino Theatre after Christmas, where it ran until March 15, 1913, for a total of 120 performances. After The Firefly, Friml produced three more operettas that each had longer runs than The Firefly, although they are not as enduringly successful.Cummings, Robert. The Firefly, All Music Guide These were High Jinks (1913), Katinka (1915) and You're in Love (1917). He also contributed songs to a musical in 1915 entitled The Peasant Girl. Trentini was named as a co-respondent in Friml's divorce from his first wife in 1915, and evidence was introduced that they were having an affair. Another show, Sometime, written with Rida Johnson Young and starring Ed Wynn and Mae West, ran well on Broadway in 1918‚Äì1919.Bordman, Gerald Martin. American Musical Theatre: A Chronicle, Oxford University Press (2010), p. 385 Friml's greatest successes Friml wrote his most famous operettas in the 1920s. In 1924, he wrote Rose-Marie. This operetta, on which Friml collaborated with lyricists Oscar Hammerstein II and Otto Harbach and co- composer Herbert Stothart, was a hit worldwide, and a few of the songs from it also became hits including \\"The Mounties\\" and \\"Indian Love Call\\". The use of murder as part of the plot was ground-breaking among operettas and musical theatre pieces at the time. After Rose-Marie's success came two other hit operettas, The Vagabond King in 1925, with lyrics by Brian Hooker and William H. Post, and The Three Musketeers in 1928, with lyrics by P. G. Wodehouse and Clifford Grey, based on Alexandre Dumas's famous swashbuckling novel. In addition, Friml contributed to the Ziegfeld Follies of 1921 and 1923. Friml wrote music for many films during the 1930s, often songs adapted from previous work. The Vagabond King, Rose-Marie and The Firefly were all made into films and included at least some of Friml's music. His operetta version of The Three Musketeers was never filmed. In 1930, he wrote a new operetta score for film, The Lottery Bride. Like his contemporary, Ivor Novello, Friml was sometimes ridiculed for the sentimental and insubstantial nature of his compositions and was often called trite. Friml was also criticized for the old-fashioned, Old World sentiments found in his works. Friml's last stage musical was Music Hath Charms in 1934. During the 1930s, Friml's music fell out of fashion on Broadway and in Hollywood.Program notes, Rose Marie, Light Opera of New York, Landmark on the Park theatre, February 2012 Later years and legacy Rather than trying to adapt to popular taste, Friml decided to focus on playing the piano in concert and composing art music, which he did into his nineties. He also composed the music for the 1947 film Northwest Outpost, starring Nelson Eddy and Ilona Massey. A few of Friml's works have seen revivals on Broadway; these include a 1943 production of The Vagabond King and a 1984 production of The Three Musketeers. \\"The Donkey Serenade\\" from the film version of The Firefly, \\"The Mounties\\" and \\"Indian Love Call\\" are still frequently heard, often in romantic parody or comic situations. His piano music is also often performed. In 1967, Friml performed in a special concert at the Curran Theatre in San Francisco. As he often did in his concerts, he began the concert with a piano improvisation, then played special arrangements of his own compositions as well as composers who had influenced him. He even played Dvo≈ô√°k's Humoresque as a special tribute to his teacher. He also appeared on Lawrence Welk's television program in 1971.\\"Rudolf Friml\\", Internet Movie Database, accessed July 27, 2017 He was one of the original inductees into the Songwriter's Hall of Fame. His two sons also worked as musicians. Rudolf Jr. was a big band leader in the 1930s and 1940s, and William, a son from Friml's third marriage, was a composer and arranger in Hollywood. In 1969, Friml was celebrated by Ogden Nash on the occasion of his 90th birthday in a couplet which ended: \\"I trust your conclusion and mine are similar: 'Twould be a happier world if it were Frimler.\\" Similarly, satiric songwriter Tom Lehrer made a reference to Friml on his first album, Songs by Tom Lehrer (1953). The song \\"The Wiener Schnitzel Waltz\\" includes the lyric, \\"Your lips were like wine (if you'll pardon the simile) / The music was lovely, and quite Rudolf Friml-y.\\" Near the end of the 1957 musical The Music Man, Harold Hill lies to Marian Paroo: \\"I'm expecting a telegram from Rudy Friml, and this could be it.\\"Kurtti, Jeff. \\"The Music Man\\", The Great Movie Musical Trivia Book, Hal Leonard Corporation, 1996, p. 139, Friml died in Los Angeles in 1972 and was interred in the \\"Court of Honor\\" at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.

History The name Bug probably came from the old Germanic word *baug-s, which meant something winding or bent. Slavs adopted the word Baug from the Goths, who previously lived in large numbers near the river. Traditionally, e.g. by the drafters of the Curzon Line, the Bug River has been considered to be the ethnographical border between the East and West as well as the border between Polish Orthodox and Catholic peoples. The Bug was part of the frontier between the slices of Poland occupied by Austria and Russia after the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, the southern half of the eastern border of the Duchy of Warsaw (1809-1815), Congress Poland (1815-1867), of the Vistula Land (1867-1913), and of the Regency Kingdom of Poland (1917-1918). The Bug also formed part of the dividing line between German Wehrmacht and Soviet Red Army zones specified in a secret clause of the German‚ÄìSoviet Frontier Treaty of 28 September 1939 following the September 1939 invasion of Poland in the Second World War. Geographic characteristics Allegory of the Bug River, a statue on the terrace of the ≈Åazienki Palace in Royal Baths Park, Warsaw, Poland The Bug is a left tributary of the Narew. It flows from the Lviv Oblast in the west of Ukraine northwards into the Volyn Oblast, before passing along the Ukraine-Polish and Polish-Belarusian border and into Poland, where it follows part of the border between the Masovian and Podlaskie Voivodeships. It joins the Narew at Serock, a few kilometers upstream of the artificial Zegrze Lake. This part of the Narew between the confluence and the Vistula is sometimes referred to as Bugo-Narew but on December 27, 1962, the Prime Minister of Poland's act abolished the name \\"Bugo-Narew\\", soon after Zegrze Lake was completed. \\"Monitor Polski\\" 1963, nr 3, poz. 6 On the Bug, a few kilometers from the Vysokaye in Kamenets District of the Brest Region, is the westernmost point of Belarus. It is also connected with the Dnieper via the Mukhavets, a right-bank tributary, by the Dnieper-Bug Canal. Basin The total basin area of Bug is of which half, or, 50%, is in Poland. Somewhat more than a quarter, or 29%, is in Belarus, and a bit under a quarter, or 22% lies in Ukraine. The climate of the Bug basin is temperate. The basin experiences annual high-water levels during spring flooding due to thawing snow, after which a low flow period starts and lasts until October or mid-November. Occasional summer floods often occur in the headlands, where mountains influence favorable flash-flood conditions. In Autumn the water level increases are inconsiderable; in some years they do not happen at all. During the winter the river can have temporary ice-outs that sometimes provoke ice jams, causing an increase of the level up to . The resultant water levels are changeable due to the instability of ice cover. Flooding Significant floods during the last 60 years in Belarus were registered in 1958, 1962, 1967, 1971 and 1974. The largest spring flood was observed in 1979, when the maximum water discharge was 19.1 cubic metres per second on 24 March 1979, at the village of Chersk; 166 cubic metres per second near the village of Tyukhinichi (Lyasnaya river) on 31 March 1979; and 269 cubic metres per second near Brest on 1 April 1979. A similar spring flood occurred in 1999, when the spring run-off in March‚ÄìMay exceeded the average annual value by almost half again (48%). The last time the Bug flooded in Poland and Ukraine was in 2010 and the last time it flooded in Belarus was in 1999.

Nomenclature, etymology and history (, Pivdennyi Buh; ; ; Ottoman ) Herodotus (c. 484‚Äì425 BCE) refers to the river using its ancient Greek name: Hypanis. During the Migration Period of the 5th to the 8th centuries CE the Southern Bug represented a major obstacle to all the migrating peoples in the area. The long-standing local Slavic name of the river, Boh (Cyrillic: –ë–æ–≥), may derive from a root meaning \\"rich\\" (, bahata). The 17th-century French military engineer and geographer Guillaume Le Vasseur de Beauplan () recorded the name of the river as Boh Ruthenian (, Boh Ruskyi). Compare: From the 16th to the 18th centuries most of the Southern Ukraine formed part of the Crimean Khanate and/or of the Ottoman Empire; the river had the Turkic name Aq-su, meaning the \\"White river\\". \\"Bug\\", a Russian name, became established during the colonial period in Ukraine and known internationally. It was a misnomer given by a Russian geologist Vladimir Laskaryev at the beginning of 20th century. On March 6, 1918 the Central Council of Ukraine (Tsentralna Rada of the Ukrainian People's Republic) adopted the law \\"For the administrative- territorial division of Ukraine\\", dividing Ukraine into numerous lands. One of those lands in the upper stream of the river was named \\"Boh land\\" (, Pobozhia). Previously in the 18th century there had existed the Bohogard phalanx (, Bohogardivska palanka) as part of the Zaporizhian Sich centered in the city of Gard (today a tract near Yuzhnoukrainsk). Tributaries The main tributaries of the Southern Bug are, from source to mouth (length in parentheses): *Left: Buzhok (75), Ikva (57), Snyvoda (58), Desna (80), Sob (115), Udych (56), Synytsia (78), Synyukha (111), Velyka Korabelna (45), Mertvovid (114), Hnylyi Yelanets (103), Inhul (354) *Right: Vovk (71), Zghar (95), Riv (104), Silnytsia (67), Dokhna (68), Savran (97), Kodyma (149), Bakshala (57), Chychyklia (156) Bridges and ferries Varvarivskyi Bridge in Mykolayiv. The Varvarivskyi Bridge over Southern Bug in Mykolayiv is a swing bridge (facilitating ship building) with Europe's largest span (134 m). It is also the southernmost bridge over the river. Navigation The river is technically navigable for dozens of kilometers up from its mouth; several riverports (such as Mykolayiv) exist. In 2011, plans were announced to revive commercial freight navigation on the Southern Bug northerly of Mykolayiv to facilitate the increasing grain export from Ukraine.¬´–ù–ò–ë–£–õ–û–ù¬ª –∑–∞–ª–æ–∂–∏–ª –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤—É —Å–æ–±—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Ñ–ª–æ—Ç–∞ As of April 2018, freight navigation is renewed and active between the estuary and the grain terminal in the village of Prybuzhany (located in Voznesensk Raion in central part of the Mykolaiv Oblast) newly built by Nibulon.

While it was less known in the English-speaking world for centuries, Hungary's literature gained renown L√≥r√°nt Czig√°ny, A History of Hungarian Literature: from the earliest times to the mid-1970s, Clarendon Press, 1984 in the 19th and 20th centuries, thanks to a new wave of internationally accessible writers like M√≥r J√≥kai, Antal Szerb, S√°ndor M√°rai, Imre Kert√©sz and Magda Szab√≥. Earliest writings in Hungarian 10-14th century Old Hungarian Laments of Mary Chronicon Pictum Gesta Hungarorum The beginning of the history of Hungarian language as such (the proto-Hungarian period) is set at 1000 BC, when ‚Äî according to current scientific understanding ‚Äî the language had become differentiated from its closest relatives, the Ob-Ugric languages. No written evidence remains of the earliest Hungarian literature, but through folktales and folk songs, elements have survived that can be traced back to pagan times. Also extant, although only in Latin and dating from between the 11th and 14th centuries, are shortened versions of some Hungarian legends relating the origins of the Hungarian people and episodes from the conquest of Hungary and from campaigns of the 10th century. In earliest times the Hungarian language was written in a runic-like script, although it was not used for literary purposes in the modern sense. The country switched to the Latin alphabet after being Christianized under the reign of Stephen I (1000‚Äì1038). There are no existing documents from the pre-11th century era. The Old Hungarian period is reckoned from 896 CE, when Hungarians conquered the Carpathian Basin, settled down and started to build their own state. Creation of the first extant written records followed soon after. The oldest written record in Hungarian is a fragment in the Establishing charter of the abbey of Tihany (1055) which contains several Hungarian terms, among them the words feheruuaru rea meneh hodu utu rea, (\\"up the military road to Feh√©rv√°r,\\" referring to the place where the abbey was built). This text is probably to be read as Feh√©r√º v√°ru re√° mene√º hodu utu re√° with today's spelling, and it would read as a Feh√©rv√°rra men≈ë had[i] √∫tra in today's Hungarian. The rest of the document was written in Latin. The oldest complete, continuous text in Hungarian is Halotti besz√©d √©s k√∂ny√∂rg√©s, a short funeral oration written in about 1192‚Äì1195, moving in its simplicity. The oldest poem is √ìmagyar M√°ria-siralom (the Lamentations of Mary), a free translation from Latin of a poem by Godefroy de Breteuil. It is also the oldest surviving Uralic poem. Both the funeral sermon and the Lamentations are hard to read and not quite comprehensible for modern- day Hungarians, mostly because the 26-letter Latin alphabet was not sufficient to represent all the sounds in Hungarian before diacritic marks and double letters were added. During the Middle Ages and well into the Renaissance, the language of writing was mostly Latin. Important documents include the Admonitions of St. Stephen, which includes the king's admonitions to his son Prince Imre. Among the first chronicles about Hungarian history were Gesta Hungarorum (\\"Deeds of the Hungarians\\"), by an unknown author, and Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum (\\"Deeds of the Huns and the Hungarians\\") by Simon K√©zai. Both are in Latin. These chronicles mix history with legends, so historically they are not always authentic. Another chronicle is the K√©pes Kr√≥nika (Illustrated Chronicle), which was written for Louis the Great. Further, Rogerius's 13th century work was published with J√°nos Thur√≥czy's chronicle in the late 15th century. In Split (now a part of Croatia) Thomas of Spalato wrote on local history, with much information on Hungary in the 13th century. At that time Dalmatia and the city of Split were part of the Kingdom of Hungary. Renaissance and Baroque 15-17th century The 15th century saw the first translations from the Bible. Two Transylvanian preachers, Thomas and Valentine, followers of the Bohemian religious reformer Jan Hus, were responsible for this work, of which the prophetic books, the Psalms, and the Gospels have survived. A great part of the vocabulary created for the purpose is still in use. Renaissance literature flourished under the reign of King Matthias (1458‚Äì1490). Janus Pannonius, although he wrote in Latin, counts as one of the most important persons in Hungarian literature, being the only significant Hungarian humanist poet of the period. The first printing house was also founded during Matthias's reign, by Andr√°s Hess, in Buda. The first book printed in Hungary was the Chronica Hungarorum. In 1526 most of Hungary fell under Ottoman occupation, from which date the beginning of the Middle Hungarian period is set, in connection with various cultural changes. The most important poets of the period were B√°lint Balassi (1554‚Äì1594), Sebesty√©n Tin√≥di Lantos (c. 1510‚Äì1556) and Mikl√≥s Zr√≠nyi (1620‚Äì1664). Balassi's poetry shows Mediaeval influences. His poems can be divided into three thematic categories: love poems, war poems and religious poems. Zr√≠nyi's most significant work, Szigeti veszedelem (\\"Peril of Sziget\\", 1648/49) is an epic written in the style of the Iliad, and recounts the heroic Battle of Szigetv√°r, where his great-grandfather died while defending the castle of Szigetv√°r. The cover of a Hungarian book from the time: G√°sp√°r Heltai's \\"Chronicle about the affairs of the Magyars\\" Translation of Roman authors produced also some works: J√°nos Baranyai Decsi translated Sallustius's Catalina and Jughurta's war in the late 16th century. A decade later appeared the translation of Curtius Rufus's life of Alexander in Debrecen. Historical works were even more numerous: the chronicle of G√°sp√°r Heltai, published by him in Kolozsv√°r; Zay Ferenc's unpublished work on the siege of Belgrade from the 15th century; Kem√©ny J√°nos's Transylvanian Dukes, and Mikl√≥s Bethlen's memoirs with J√°nos Szal√°rdy's voluminous then-unpublished work on Transylvanian history from Bethlen's reign to the 1660s; and Mih√°ly Cserei's early 18th-century work are highlights of Hungarian-language literature. Another category is historical verses in Hungarian, like that of Sebesty√©n Tin√≥di Lantos from the 16th century, P√©ter Ilosvai Selymes, Mih√°ly Szabatkai and Gergely Bornemissza. Latin works in the period are more numerous. Istv√°n Szamosk√∂zy, J√°nos Baranyai Decsi, Mikl√≥s Istv√°nffy, J√°nos Bethlen, and Farkas Bethlen, Ferenc Forg√°ch, Gy√∂rgy Szer√©mi, Ambrus Somogyi, Gianmichele Bruto and Ol√°h Mikl√≥s are the most important authors of historical works from the 16th to 17th century. In German Georg Kraus and Georg Zeiler wrote on Transylvanian history. In Spanish one may read Bernardo de Aldana's apology for the 1552 loss of the castle of Lippa to the Turks. Among religious literary works the most important is the Bible translation by G√°sp√°r K√°roli, the Protestant pastor of G√∂nc, in 1590. The translation is called the Bible of Vizsoly, after the town where it was first published. Another important religious work is the Legend of Saint Margaret, copied by Lea R√°skai around 1510 from an earlier work that did not survive. Enlightenment and the language reform The Hungarian enlightenment arrived, via Vienna, about fifty years after the Western European enlightenment. The first Enlightenment writers were Maria Theresia's bodyguards (Gy√∂rgy Bessenyei, J√°nos Bats√°nyi and so on). The greatest poets of the time were Mih√°ly Csokonai Vit√©z and D√°niel Berzsenyi. The most prominent figure of Hungarian language reform was Ferenc Kazinczy, who helped make the Hungarian language feasible for scientific explanations; furthermore, a lot of new words were coined for describing new inventions (for example, mozdony, which means 'locomotive.' Previously the loan word lokomot√≠v had been used.)

The Ordos Desert () is a desert/steppe region in Northwest China, administrated under the prefecture of Ordos City in the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region (centered ca. ). It extends over an area of approximately , and comprises two sub-deserts: China's 7th largest desert, the Kubuqi Desert, in the north; and China's 8th largest desert, the Mu Us Desert, in the south. Wedged between the arable Hetao region to the north and the Loess Plateau to the south, the soil of the Ordos Desert is mostly a mixture of dry clay and sand, and as a result is poorly suited for agriculture. Location The Ordos Desert is almost completely encircled in the west, north and east by a great rectangular bend of the middle Yellow River known as the Ordos Loop. Mountain ranges separate the Ordos from the Gobi Desert north and east of the Yellow River. The northern border serves as the southern border of the Mu Us Desert. The mountain chains separating the Ordos from the central Gobi in the north of the great bend of the Yellow River are: the Kara-naryn-ula, the Sheitenula, and the Yin Mountains, which link on to the south end of the Greater Khingan Mountains. In the south and east, the Great Wall of China separates the Ordos from fertile loess lands. The Ordos covers the southern section of the Inner Mongolia, an Autonomous Region of China, the Ningxia, an Autonomous Entity of China, and the Chinese Provinces of Shaanxi and Gansu. History Bronze statuette of a man, Ordos, 3-1st century BCE. British Museum. Ancient names of the Ordos region are He-tau and - later - He-nan (\\"the country south of the river\\"). It was occupied by horse nomads for many centuries, and these were very often at war with China. In the 1st and 2nd centuries CE, it was occupied by the Xiongnu, but was almost depopulated during and after the Dungan revolt of 1869. This region was a desert during the Late Glacial Maximum. During the Holocene Climatic Optimum the monsoonal rains that reached the Loess Plateau in the modern era pushed the desert back to the Yellow River. Since then, overgrazing at various periods and in the modern period, the lack of rainfall, has resulted in a return to desert conditions. However, the most disastrous damage to the environment was caused by the political movements launched by Mao Zedong, namely the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, during which the thin line of fragile vegetation separating the Kubuqi and Maowusu deserts was destroyed. Subsequent pressure of population and the increase in sheep/goats/cattle further damaged the already weakened local environment to the point of no return, and as a result, the two deserts finally linked up in the 1990s, forming the larger current day Ordos. Relief The Ordos Desert forms an intermediate step in the descent from the Himalayas to the lowlands of eastern China. Towards the south it rises to an altitude of over 1,500 m, and in the west, along the right bank of the Yellow River, the Arbus or Arbiso Mountains, which overlie the steppe by some 900 m, serve to link the Helan Mountains with the Yin Mountains. The northern part of the great bend of the Yellow River is filled with the sands of Kuzupchi River, a succession of dunes, 12-15 m high. In some places these sand-dunes approach close to the Yellow River; in others they are parted from it by a belt of sand, intermingled with clay, which terminates in a steep escarpment, 15 m and in some localities 30 m above the river. Eventually the sand dunes cross over to the left bank of the Yellow River where they are threaded by the beds of dry watercourses. The Yin Mountains, which stretch from 108¬∞ to 112¬∞ E in the north of the great bend of the Yellow River, have a wild alpine character and are distinguished from other mountains in the southeast of Mongolia by an abundance of both water and vegetation. In one of their constituent ranges, the bold Muni-uul, long and nearly wide, they attain elevations of , and have steep flanks, slashed with rugged gorges and narrow glens. Climate The desert receives less than 250 mm of precipitation annually, and most of this is in the form of summer thunderstorms. The region has many salt lakes and intermittent streams. Winters are bitter cold, with cold winds blowing into the region from the north and west, and January temperatures ranging from ‚àí13 to ‚àí10 ¬∞C Fauna and flora The vegetation of the Ordos region is made up of montane grasslands and shrublands. Among the sand dunes in the north, shrubs including Hedysarum scoparium and Calligonum arborescens grow in scattered patches. Native grasses and herbs include Bromus inermis, Agropyron mongolicum, A. cristatum, Festuca arundinacea, Elymus dahuricus, Melilotus albus, M. officinalis, Lotus corniculatus, Pugionium cornutum, Astragalus adsurgens, and Filifolium sibiricum.Kang Mu-Yi et al.

Acta Botanica Sinica 2003, 45 (10): 1157-1165. The belt of sand and clay which separates the sand dunes from the Huang He in places is studded with little mounds (up to 1.2 m high), mostly overgrown with wormwood (Artemisia campestris) and the Siberian pea-tree (Caragana spp.); and here too grows one of the most characteristic plants of Ordos, the liquorice root (Glycyrrhiza uralensis). On the left bank of the Huang He, level spaces amongst the dry river beds are studded with little mounds (9 cm to 1.8 m high), on which grow stunted Nitraria schoberi and Zygophyllum. Towards the south, sparse scrub vegetation is found. Forest thickets thrive along the river margins. In the Yin Mountains, forests begin at altitudes of 1,600 m and wild flowers grow in great profusion and variety in summer, though with a striking lack of color. In this same border range there is also a much greater abundance and variety of animal life, especially among the birds. Rare bird species also breed in the saline lakes of the Ordos, among them Relict Gulls (Larus relictus) breeding at Lake Hongjiannao; for this species the Ordos is home to the world's largest breeding colony. The present status of large mammals in the region is largely unclear. In the past, it was inhabited by wild two-humped Bactrian camels, snow leopards, Przewalski's gazelles, and Przewalski's horses. Economy The alkaline soil allows for some nomadic Mongol herders to raise sheep and goats. Heavy grazing by goats has done damage to the grasslands in the region and led to desertification. The oasis in the region support small scale farming. The area contains large soda deposits which are heavily mined.

Kronecker's approximation theorem had been firstly proved by L. Kronecker in the end of the 19th century. It has been now revealed to relate to the idea of n-torus and Mahler measure since the later half of the 20th century. In terms of physical systems, it has the consequence that planets in circular orbits moving uniformly around a star will, over time, assume all alignments, unless there is an exact dependency between their orbital periods.  Statement  Kronecker's theorem is a result in diophantine approximations applying to several real numbers xi, for 1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ n, that generalises Dirichlet's approximation theorem to multiple variables. The classical Kronecker approximation theorem is formulated as follows. :Given real n-tuples \\\\alpha_i=(\\\\alpha_{i 1},\\\\cdots,\\\\alpha_{i n})\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^n, i=1,\\\\cdots,m and \\\\beta=(\\\\beta_1,\\\\cdots,\\\\beta_n)\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n , the condition: ::\\\\forall \\\\epsilon > 0 \\\\, \\\\exists q_i, p_j \\\\in \\\\mathbb Z : \\\\biggl \\\\sum^m_{i=1}q_i\\\\alpha_{ij}-p_j-\\\\beta_j\\\\biggr<\\\\epsilon, 1\\\\le j\\\\le n :holds if and only if for any r_1,\\\\dots,r_n\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z},\\\\ i=1,\\\\dots,m with ::\\\\sum^n_{j=1}\\\\alpha_{ij}r_j\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}, \\\\ \\\\ i=1,\\\\dots,m\\\\ , :the number \\\\sum^n_{j=1}\\\\beta_jr_j is also an integer. In plainer language the first condition states that the tuple \\\\beta = (\\\\beta_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\beta_n) can be approximated arbitrarily well by linear combinations of the \\\\alpha_is (with integer coefficients) and integer vectors. For the case of a m=1 and n=1, Kronecker's Approximation Theorem can be stated as follows. For any \\\\alpha, \\\\beta, \\\\epsilon \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}, with \\\\alpha irrational and \\\\epsilon > 0, then there exists integers p and q with q>0, such that ::\\\\alpha q - p - \\\\beta < \\\\epsilon. Relation to tori In the case of N numbers, taken as a single N-tuple and point P of the torus :T = RN/ZN, the closure of the subgroup generated by P will be finite, or some torus T‚Ä≤ contained in T. The original Kronecker's theorem (Leopold Kronecker, 1884) stated that the necessary condition for :T‚Ä≤ = T, which is that the numbers xi together with 1 should be linearly independent over the rational numbers, is also sufficient. Here it is easy to see that if some linear combination of the xi and 1 with non-zero rational number coefficients is zero, then the coefficients may be taken as integers, and a character œá of the group T other than the trivial character takes the value 1 on P. By Pontryagin duality we have T‚Ä≤ contained in the kernel of œá, and therefore not equal to T. In fact a thorough use of Pontryagin duality here shows that the whole Kronecker theorem describes the closure of as the intersection of the kernels of the œá with :œá(P) = 1. This gives an (antitone) Galois connection between monogenic closed subgroups of T (those with a single generator, in the topological sense), and sets of characters with kernel containing a given point. Not all closed subgroups occur as monogenic; for example a subgroup that has a torus of dimension ‚â• 1 as connected component of the identity element, and that is not connected, cannot be such a subgroup. The theorem leaves open the question of how well (uniformly) the multiples mP of P fill up the closure. In the one-dimensional case, the distribution is uniform by the equidistribution theorem.

In 1761, Pestalozzi attended the Gymnasium (Collegium Humanitatis) and received instruction from educators Johann Jakob Bodmer, who taught history and politics, and Johann Jakob Breitinger, who taught Greek and Hebrew. On holidays Pestalozzi would visit his maternal grandfather, a clergyman in H√∂ngg. Together they would travel to schools and the houses of parishioners. It was through these visits that Pestalozzi learned the poverty of country peasants. He saw the consequences of putting children to work in factories at an early age and he saw how little the Catechism schools did for them. Their ignorance, suffering and inability to help themselves left an impression on Pestalozzi, an impression that would guide his future educational ideas. Pestalozzi was educated to become a clergyman. As a clergyman, he expected to have ample opportunity to carry out his educational ideas; however, the failure of his first sermon and influence from philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau led him to pursue a career in law and political justice. =Young adulthood and early political aspirations ‚Äì 1765‚Äì1767= During the mid-18th century the government in Switzerland condemned Rousseau's Emile and Social Contract, saying they were dangerous to the State and the Christian religion. A prison sentence was issued upon Rousseau. Bodmer, Pestalozzi's former professor, embraced the teachings of Rousseau and founded the Helvetic Society with about 20 other philosophers in 1765. Their goal was the advancement of freedom. The 19-year-old Pestalozzi was an active member, contributing many articles to the Society's newspaper, Der Erinnerer. Pestalozzi brought to light several cases of official corruption and was believed to be an accessory to the escape of a fellow newspaper contributor. Although he was later proven innocent, he was under arrest for three days. These events caused Pestalozzi to have many political enemies and destroyed any hope of a legal career. =Neuhof ‚Äì 1769‚Äì1779= After the failure of his political aspirations and at the suggestion of several friends, Pestalozzi decided to become a farmer. During this time, Johann Rudolf Tschiffeli, who was also a member of the Helvetic Society, attracted widespread attention regarding his successful business model. He had converted a large plot of worthless land into several valuable farms. In 1767 Pestalozzi visited Tschiffeli to learn about his method. After a year with Tschiffeli, Pestalozzi purchased 15 acres of waste land in the neighborhood of Z√ºrich. He obtained financial support from a Z√ºrich banker, bought more land and, in 1769, he married Anna Schulthess. Pestalozzi began to build a house on the heavily mortgaged property, calling it \\"Neuhof\\". The land he had bought, however, was unsuitable to farm. Unfavorable reports led the banker to withdraw his support. Pestalozzi added a wool-spinning business to the farm, hoping to improve his financial situation. The challenges increased as much as his debt. Three months after their financial support was withdrawn, Schulthess gave birth to the couple's only son, Jean-Jacques Pestalozzi. He was nicknamed Schaggeli and often had epileptic fits that led Pestalozzi and Schulthess to worry constantly about his health. Transition from farm to industrial school at Neuhof After the failure of his farming venture, Pestalozzi wanted to help the poor. He had been poor himself most of his life and had observed orphans who gained apprenticeships as farmers only to be overworked and underfed. He desired to teach them how to live self-respecting lives. This led him to the conception of converting Neuhof into an industrial school. Against the wishes of his wife's family, Pestalozzi gained the support of philosopher Isaak Iselin of Basel, who published it in Die Ephemerides, a periodical devoted to social and economic questions. The publication led to subscriptions and loans free of interest. The new foundation had a short period of apparent prosperity, but after a year Pestalozzi's old faults again led the institution to near ruin. An appeal for public support in 1777 brought much-needed help, and Pestalozzi contributed to the periodical a series of letters on the education of the poor. The appeal, however, only postponed the failure of the institution. In 1779, Pestalozzi had to close Neuhof. With help from his friends, Pestalozzi was able to save the house at Neuhof for himself and his family to live in. Despite the property being saved, they were in financial ruin and were reduced to poverty. His family connections abandoned him, along with most people who had shown interest in his ideas. =Period of literary activity ‚Äì 1780‚Äì1797= The Evening Hours of a Hermit ‚Äì 1780 Iselin remained a friend of Pestalozzi and encouraged him to continue writing. In 1780 Pestalozzi published anonymously in Die Ephemerides a series of aphorisms entitled The Evening Hours of a Hermit. They are his earliest works which outline ideas that would later be known as Pestalozzian. The aphorisms attracted little attention at the time of publication. Leonard and Gertrude ‚Äì 1781, 1783, 1785, 1787 Pestalozzi knew the country peasant life much more intimately than his contemporaries did, from the visits of his childhood with his grandfather to his current state of poverty. He drew from these experiences and published four volumes of a story titled Leonard and Gertrude. These four volumes revolve around the lives of four characters: Gertrude, Gl√ºphi, an unnamed parish clergyman and Arner. Gertrude is a wife and mother from the village of Bonnal, who teaches her children how to live moral upstanding lives through the belief and love of God. Gl√ºphi, a school teacher, sees the success Gertrude has with her children and tries to model his school around her teachings. A parish clergyman also adopts Gertrude's teachings and the work of Gertrude, Gl√ºphi and the clergyman are helped by Arner, a politician, who solicits aid from the state. Through these four institutions, harmony is achieved and a comprehensive education is offered to all people. The first volume was very successful; however, the second through fourth volumes were not widely published or read. =Fifth and sixth volumes= Pestalozzi had planned a fifth and sixth volume, but the manuscript of the fifth was lost in his 1804 trip to Paris and it is not known if a sixth was ever written. Christopher and Elizabeth and the Schweizerblatt ‚Äì 1782 Pestalozzi wrote Christopher and Elizabeth in 1782 as a series of evening conversations to address social and political corruption. A weekly newspaper called the Schweizerblatt was also founded and disbanded during the same year with Pestalozzi briefly acting as the chief editor. Enquiries into the Course of Nature in the Development of the Human Race ‚Äì 1797 In 1794 Pestalozzi visited his sister in Leipzig. During the visit, he met Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Christoph Martin Wieland and Johann Gottfried Herder. On his return trip to Neuhof, he met Johann Gottlieb Fichte. Fichte saw in Pestalozzi's ideas the key to the solution of the educational problem, and suggested to Pestalozzi that he write about his views on human nature and the problem of its development. After three years, Pestalozzi wrote and published Enquiries into the Course of Nature in the development of the Human Race. Few people read his work, and in an 1821 edition, Pestalozzi wrote: \\"Scarcely any one has noticed the book, although it has been before the public for more than twenty years.\\" This work marked the end of his eighteen-year literary period, during which time Pestalozzi and his family lived a life of poverty. His wife was often ill, and in 1797 his son returned home from his apprenticeship in Basel in a similar state of health. =Stans ‚Äì 1799= . Political changes were taking place, and when serfdom was abolished in Switzerland in 1798, Pestalozzi decided to become an educator. He wrote a plan for a school and submitted it to Philipp Albert Stapfer, the new Minister of Arts and Sciences, who approved of Pestalozzi's plan. Pestalozzi was not able to implement his new school right away, because a suitable site could not be found quickly enough. In the meantime, Pestalozzi was asked to take charge of a government newspaper, the Helvetisches Volksblatt, in hopes that he could win the acceptance of the people of Switzerland. Political change of any kind during this period was viewed as tyrannical. When the French army invaded the town of Stans in 1798, many children were left without a home or family. The Swiss government established an orphanage and recruited Pestalozzi on December 5, 1798, to take charge of the newly formed institution. On December 7, Pestalozzi went to Stans, writing: The buildings of the Ursuline Convent at Stans were supposed to have been converted into an orphanage, but little had been done when Pestalozzi arrived. On January 14, 1799, a number of orphans came to the newly established institution. Pestalozzi wrote, \\"They were in a dreadful condition, both of body and of mind\\". He took many roles at Stans, including a master, servant, father, guardian, sick-nurse and teacher. He had no school materials and his only assistant was a housekeeper. Drawing from previous experience, his aim at Stans was similar to that of Neuhof: the combination of education and industry. However, he no longer looked at the products of the children's labors as a possible source of income. Any work was considered by Pestalozzi as a way to train physical dexterity, promote efficiency and encourage mutual helpfulness. He wanted to cultivate the fundamental activities of the mind‚Äî\\"the powers of attention, observation, and memory, which must precede the art of judgment and must be well established before the latter is exercised.\\" It was during his time at Stans that Pestalozzi realized the significance of a universal method of education, which he would attempt to apply at future institutions. In June 1799, the French army, after being defeated by the Austrians, took back Stans. They needed every available building to house their troops, and the school was broken up. Even during the short time of the orphanage, Pestalozzi's success was apparent in the well-being of the children. He left Stans in order to recover in Gurnigel, an Alpine health resort, hoping to return to the orphanage when the buildings were free, but he was not permitted to return. =Burgdorf ‚Äì 1800‚Äì1804= The Burgdorf Castle where Pestalozzi ran his institute from 1800 to 1804 During his recovery in Gurnigel, Stapfer assigned Pestalozzi to the town of Burgdorf. He was to receive a small quarterly salary, an apartment and a position teaching at the lowest school in town. Pestalozzi's position was not held long; the shoemaker who ran the school before Pestalozzi had arrived did not agree with his ideas. Shortly after, Pestalozzi was able to transfer to a different school. The children were five to eight years old. Pestalozzi was nervous at first, but he continued his investigations and experiments in education carried out at Stans. A book was suggested to Pestalozzi by a friend, . Although Pestalozzi said he did not know much French, what he was able to understand \\"threw a flood of light upon my whole endeavor\\". It confirmed his ideas of education that he had developed at Neuhof, Stans, and now Burgdorf, in which all understanding can be achieved through a psychologically ordered sequence. In January 1800, a young teaching assistant, Hermann Kr√ºsi, offered to help Pestalozzi. Kr√ºsi already had some practical teaching experience and followed the example set by Pestalozzi. After eight months of teaching, Pestalozzi was evaluated by school authorities who praised him for his progress. In eight months, he had not only taught children of five and six years of age to read perfectly, but also to write, draw and understand arithmetic. The school board promoted Pestalozzi to a mastership in the second boys' school where he continued his educational experiments. Fueled by his success, in October 1800 Pestalozzi decided to open another school in Burgdorf, the \\"Educational Institute for the Children of the Middle Classes\\", in the Burgdorf Castle. Here, two educators joined Pestalozzi, Johann Georg Tobler and Johann Christoff B√ºss. During this time Pestalozzi systemized and codified many of his methods and ideas about education. How Gertrude Teaches her Children ‚Äì 1801 Pestalozzi for the second time in his literary career attracted a wide circle of readers after publishing How Gertrude Teaches her Children. The book had a profound impact on the opinion and practice of education. It is written in the form of fourteen letters from Pestalozzi to his friend Heinrich Gessner, a bookbinder in Berne. The first three letters describe how he, Kr√ºsi, Tobler, and B√ºss came to their present situation at Burgdorf. Letters four to eleven are his reflections and experience in pedagogical instruction and educational theory. The twelfth letter is about physical education while the last two letters talk about moral and religious education. Pestalozzi's purpose in these letters was to show that, by reducing knowledge to its elements and by constructing a series of psychologically ordered exercises, anybody could teach their children effectively. Because of this literary success, people from all parts of Switzerland and Germany came to see the school in Burgdorf. The school grew, but Pestalozzi still felt that he was not doing enough. Though a financial success, the school could not do what Pestalozzi desired: educate the poor. He communicated to the Swiss government that he would like more opportunity to educate the poor. In response it sent two commissioners to investigate his work and, following their favorable review, the government decided to transform Pestalozzi's school into a national institution. Staff would receive fixed salaries and money would be spent to publish textbooks written by Pestalozzi and his staff. Using this money, in 1803 Pestalozzi published three elementary books: The ABC of Sense Perception, Lessons on the Observation of Number Relations and The Mother's Book. Two additions were made to Pestalozzi's staff during this time: Johann Joseph Schmid (1785‚Äì1851) and Johannes Niederer (1779‚Äì1843). Schmid had been at the institute as a poor pupil but was added to the staff for his teaching ability. Niederer had formerly been a minister. Pestalozzi's family finally joined him in the institute to live and work. In 1801 Pestalozzi's son, Jean-Jacques, died at the age of 31, but his daughter-in-law and grandchild, Gottlieb, moved from Neuhof to Burgdorf to live at the institute. Trip to Paris ‚Äì 1804 Political changes by Napoleon during this time put Pestalozzi's institute in jeopardy through reform in the Swiss government. A national deputation was sent to Paris to interview Napoleon on behalf of Switzerland. Pestalozzi was elected as a member of this deputation. Before going, he published his ideas about political effort. It is a unique document in Pestalozzi's work that shows the connection of his political, social and educational influence. Pestalozzi did not enjoy his time in Paris; Napoleon had no interest in his work. On his return, Pestalozzi found the new Swiss government questioning his right to use the facilities at Burgdorf. They notified him that his services were no longer needed on the grounds that the buildings were needed for their own officials. To avoid being criticized by the public, however, the authorities offered Pestalozzi the use of an old monastery in M√ºnchenbuchsee. Pestalozzi received offers to establish his institute in other towns, but ultimately he decided to accept the Government's offer and, in June 1804, Pestalozzi's work in Burgdorf ended. =M√ºnchenbuchsee ‚Äì 1804‚Äì1805= Pestalozzi's stay at M√ºnchenbuchsee was short. Nearby in Hofwil, there was another educational establishment run by Philipp Emanuel von Fellenberg. Pestalozzi's colleagues convinced him to collaborate with Fellenberg to plan the new institute at M√ºnchenbuchsee. Pestalozzi and Fellenberg did not get along and after months of planning it was decided to move the institute to Yverdon. =Yverdon ‚Äì 1805‚Äì1825= By far, the institute at Yverdon was the longest lasting of Pestalozzi's endeavors. Pestalozzi spent the first few months of his stay at Yverdon in quiet literary work, thanks to a monetary gift from the King of Denmark, Christian VII. During this time he wrote Views and Experiences relating to the idea of Elementary Education. In July 1805 the institute at Yverdon opened and attracted visitors and pupils from all over Europe. Many governments sent their own educators to study with Pestalozzi with the desire to implement a similar system in their own nations. In May 1807, Die Wochenschrift fur Menschenbildung, a newspaper published by the institute, was started by Niederer and regularly included philosophical discussions about education and reports to parents and the public about the institute's progress. Some notable changes to the institute at Yverdon were that pupils of any age were educated, not just young children; German, French, Latin and Greek were taught along with geography, natural history, history, literature, arithmetic, geometry, surveying, drawing, writing and singing. At the height of the institution's fame Pestalozzi was highly regarded for his work as an educator and in educational reform. As time went on, Pestalozzi felt that his colleagues were growing farther apart, something he called the \\"canker of disunion\\". Disagreement had not yet developed into open conflict, but different views about policy were represented by Niederer and Schmid. Niederer had gained influence in the institution and started to add subjects that teachers were not competent to teach. Schmid was open about his criticisms and the division grew among the institute's staff. In 1809 and 1810 the criticism was so great that Niederer suggested to Pestalozzi that an impartial commission be brought in from the Government to assess the conduct and efficiency of the institute. Against Schmid's wishes, Pestalozzi agreed, and in 1810 the state commissioners visited Yverdon. The commissioners' report looked favorably upon Pestalozzi's ideas but not on the practices of the institute. Any hope of Yverdon becoming a state institution was cut off. Pestalozzi felt that justice had not been done. Schmid resigned his post and neither Pestalozzi nor Niederer could fill his position as teacher of mathematics, so instead they opened a printing and bookselling business. This proved to be a financial failure, and only through the help of friends was the institute able to stay on its feet until 1815, when Schmid returned. During the period of Schmid's absence, Pestalozzi wrote Swansong, a restatement of his educational doctrines, and Life's Destiny, a review of his life's work. These were not published until 1826 when they were joined into one book called Pestalozzi's Swansong. In 1814 he also wrote an article titled \\"To the Innocent, Serious, and Magnanimous of my Fatherland\\", a testimony to the many people living in poverty which his institutions could not reach. After the death of Pestalozzi's wife in 1815, Kr√ºsi resigned from the institute. Niederer followed in 1817. Overcome by troubles, Pestalozzi sought Schmid's help. Schmid managed to raise ¬£2,500 by publishing a compilation of Pestalozzi's works. The institute remained open for another 10 years, during which time Pestalozzi tried to convince Kr√ºsi and Niederer to return. In 1825 the institute had to be closed due to a lack of funds. =Death= Memorial at Pestalozziwiese (Bahnhofstrasse) in Z√ºrich, Switzerland Pestalozzi returned to his old home at Neuhof and published Pestalozzi's Swansong. This provoked many bitter responses, by Fellenberg and Niederer in particular. Pestalozzi did not take lightly to these criticisms. He became sick on February 15, 1827, and died two days later in Brugg on February 17, 1827. His last words were, \\"I forgive my enemies. May they now find peace to which I am going forever.\\" The inscription on Pestalozzi's grave reads: Heinrich Pestalozzi: born in Zurich January 12, 1746 died in Brugg February 17, 1827 Saviour of the Poor on the Neuhof. Preacher to the People in Leonard and Gertrude In Stans, Father of the orphan, In Burgdorf and M√ºnchenbuchsee, Founder of the New Primary Education. In Yverdon, Educator of Humanity. He was an individual, a Christian and a citizen. He did everything for others, nothing for himself! Bless his name! Ideas Pestalozzi was a Romantic who felt that education must be broken down to its elements in order to have a complete understanding of it. Based on what he had learnt by operating schools at Neuhof, Stans, Burgdorf and Yverdon, Pestalozzi emphasized that every aspect of the child's life contributed to the formation of their personality, character, and capacity to reason. His educational methods were child-centered and based on individual differences, sense perception, and the student's self-activity. He worked in Yverdon to \\"elementarize\\" the teaching of ancient languages, principally Latin, but also Hebrew and Greek. In 1819, Stephan Ludwig Roth came to study with Pestalozzi, and his new humanism contributed to the development of the method of language teaching, including considerations such as the function of the mother tongue in the teaching of ancient languages. Pestalozzi and Niederer were important influences on the theory of physical education; they developed a regimen of physical exercise and outdoor activity linked to general, moral and intellectual education that reflected Pestalozzi's ideal of harmony and human autonomy. Pestalozzi's philosophy of education was based on a four-sphere concept of life and the premise that human nature was essentially good. The first three \\"exterior\\" spheres‚Äîhome and family, vocational and individual self-determination, and state and nation‚Äîrecognized the family, the utility of individuality, and the applicability of the parent- child relationship to society as a whole in the development of a child's character, attitude toward learning, and sense of duty. The last \\"exterior\\" sphere‚Äîinner sense‚Äîposited that education, having provided a means of satisfying one's basic needs, results in inner peace and a keen belief in God. Legacy As Pestalozzi said himself, the real work of his life did not lie in Burgdorf or in Yverdon. It lay in the principles of education which he practised, in the development of his observation, in the training of the whole person, and in the sympathetic way of dealing with students, principles and practices which he illustrated in his six months' labors at Stans. He had the deepest effect on all branches of education, and his influence is far from being exhausted. Pestalozzi's ideas inspired Charles Mayo who returned from Switzerland to work with his sister Elizabeth Mayo. Charles had lived with Pestalozzi from 1819 to 1822 at Yverdon. The two siblings were credited with founding the formal education of infant teachers in Britain.. Schools that are named after Pestalozzi include Pestalozzi-Gymnasium Biberach and Pestalozzischule Raunheim in Germany, Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi () Elementary School in Skopje, Republic of Macedonia, Colegio Pestalozzi in Argentina, Asociaci√≥n Colegio Pestalozzi in Peru, and the Johann Pestalozzi Bilingual Academy in Aibonito, Puerto Rico, US. In fact, when the Swiss government joined the international rebuilding effort after the devastating 1963 Skopje earthquake by donating funds for the construction of a school in Skopje, it enrolled the famous Swiss architect to design the new school, equipped it with the first modern application of seismic isolation,. and named it after the Swiss pedagogue. Pestalozzi's method was used by the cantonal school in Aarau that Albert Einstein attended, and which has been credited with fostering Einstein's process of visualizing problems and his use of \\"thought experiments\\". Einstein said of his education at Aarau, \\"It made me clearly realize how much superior an education based on free action and personal responsibility is to one relying on outward authority.\\" The British charity Pestalozzi International Village Trust sponsors students from developing countries to study in the UK; it also sponsors other overseas programs. Today the Pestalozzi-Fr√∂bel-Haus in Berlin continues to train nursery school teachers.Pestalozzi Froebel Haus , retrieved 2 August 2015 Pestalozzianum in Z√ºrich was named after Pestalozzi and was established in 1875. Based in Z√ºrich, the foundation promoted the school teacher's instruction and postgraduate training. In 2003 it was renamed in Stiftung Pestalozzianum as its teacher-oriented objectives were integrated in the new model of university-like Fachhochschule colleges that was introduced in Switzerland in 2002. Kinderdorf Pestalozzi in Trogen, Switzerland, was established as foundation in 1945 to provide the Kinderdorf (children's village) for war- affected children. In 1946 the foundation stone in the municipality of Trogen in the Canton of Appenzell Ausserrhoden was laid, and in the same year children from war-torn countries settled the first houses. From 1960, in addition to European children, war orphans from Tibet lived at the orphanage, later mostly children from Korea, Tunisia, Ethiopia, Vietnam, Cambodia and Lebanon, and orphans from Switzerland since 1983. The length of stay varies from a few weeks (educational or recreational reasons) up to several years. As of 2012, the projects of the foundation benefited 321,000 children and adolescents in Switzerland and abroad. The 1989 film Pestalozzi's Mountain is a biopic about his life and career.

Biography Thomas Southerne, born on February 12, 1660, in Oxmantown, near Dublin, was an Irish dramatist. He was the son of Francis Southerne (a Dublin Brewer) and Margaret Southerne. He attended Trinity College, Dublin, in 1676 for two years and transferred schools. In 1680, he began attending Middle Temple, London to study law but was drawn away by his interest for theater. By 1682 he was greatly influenced by John Dryden and produced his first play, The Loyal Brother, or, The Persian Prince. \\"Southerne bought his prologue and epilogue from Dryden, who made extra income from his ability to turn such pieces. Despite his friendship with the new playwright, Dryden raised his prices for Southerne\\".(Kaufman) In 1684 Southerne produced his second play,The Disappointment, or, The Mother in Fashion (Kaufman). However, in 1685 he \\"enlisted as an ensign in Princess Anne's Regiment of the Duke of Berwick's Foot\\". The \\"Glorious Revolution\\" in 1688 resulted in Southerne leaving the army. The plays Southerne had written before he withdrew from the army would see the light of day for he returned to theater. With his return, he took on a new form of genre for his writing, \\"he turned from political allegory to comedy\\". In 1690 \\"Southerne made his first financial profit from his work\\". In 1691 he encounters failure with his play,The Wives Excuse, or, Cuckolds Make Themselves which was produced by Dury Lane. Thus failure would not stop Southerne, and so in 1693 he wrote another comedy,The Maid's Last Prayer, or, Any Rather Than Fail which was a success. In 1692 he was blessed with the opportunity by finishing Dryden's tragedy, Cleomenes. In February 1694 he created the tragicomedy The Fatal Marriage, or, The Innocent Adultery which was a huge success and resulted in him being established as a tragic dramatist. By 1688, \\"his subject once again ends up in a novel by his Colleague Aphra Behn,Oroonoko, or The Royal Slave was performed as a play and was a huge success\\". According to Kaufman, \\"At the age of sixty-seven Southerne offers one last play, Money The Mistress in 1726, it is a weak conclusion to an honorable career.\\" He was honored as a playwright. On May 26, 1746, at the age of eighty-seven Southerne died. According to Kaufman, \\"He was a successful man of the theater, a working playwright for forty-four years.\\" His best plays, The Wives' Excuse, The Fatal Marriage and Oroonoko, reveal a competent, indeed interesting, playwright. He experimented in a variety of dramatic forms. His contemporaries valued him for his ability to portray intensely emotional scenes and for his \\"pure\\" language. He worked in the tradition of Otway, and his tragedies point the way to his successor, Nicholas Rowe. In comedy his subject is the distressed wife, and here he offered a pattern for such playwrights as Vanbrugh, Cibber, Congreve, and Farquhar. Today readers are interested in his psychological realism, his portraits of complex characters, often women in the throes of domestic distress, and his coldly realistic, often harsh, analysis of corrupt societal relations\\". Oroonoko Thomas Southerne also wrote the play Oroonoko. One of the major changes that Southerne made to his play from Behn's version was that he turned Imoinda's skin color from black to white. \\"She becomes the invisible and reconstructed black female subject in the America's cultural discourse\\" (MacDonald).(MacDonald) Southerne plays with the idea of a double plot: one path that deals with the tragic fates of the newly interracial African lovers and the other on Charlotte's comical take on finding rich husbands for herself and her sister. Through his double plot, Southerne had hoped to illuminate a \\"twinned relationship between white women's social representation and black women's invisibility and lose of agency under colonialism's raced visual regimes\\" (MacDonald). At one point, he puts Imonida in a heroic situation where she drives the governor off with her sword when he tried to rape her. In Southerne's play, she fights beside her man during the rebellion with her bow and arrow. She also was the one who used her words to persuade Oroonoko to kill them both and vindicate the honor and the innocence of their love. She was the one who helped guide his knife into her body. Southerne does not speak of the advantages of a white womanhood like most novels during colonialism, but speaks of the unfairness and the treatment of the slaves no matter the color of their skin or gender. According to T. J. Cribb, Behn mentions that Oroonoko experiences some conflict between his devotion to Imoinda, and his need to rebel, which gives Southerne an opportunity to build Oroonoko's character on this conflict, making it a source of the play's actions. Behn ends the novel with the brutal death of Oroonoko, but the play written by Southerne ends with the \\"love death\\" with Imoinda fulfilling his pact with her.(T. J. Cribb) Southerne also emphasizes Oroonoko's honor and writes about how Oroonoko gave a speech on justifying slavery in terms of private property and civil contract. Oroonoko speaks of how their owners have paid for them and now they are a part of their estate and they may not like it, but they are no longer individuals, but pieces of property. Southerne expands the idea that even though the harsh treatments, Oroonoko is willing to come to terms with his situation and make it work. Other plays Thomas Southern's first play, The Persian Prince, or the Loyal Brother (1682), was based on a contemporary novel. The real interest of the play lay not in the plot, but in the political significance of the personages. Tachmas, the loyal brother, is obviously a flattering portrait of James II, and the villain Ismael is generally taken to represent Shaftesbury. The poet received an ensigns commission in Princess Annes regiment, and rapidly rose to the rank of captain, but his military career came to an end at the Revolution. He then gave himself up entirely to dramatic writing. In 1692 he revised and completed Cleomenes for John Dryden; and two years later he scored a great success in the sentimental drama of The Fatal Marriage, or the Innocent Adultery (1694). The piece is based on Aphra Behn's The History of the Nun, with the addition of a comic underplot. It was frequently revived, and in 1757 was altered by David Garrick and produced at Drury Lane. It was known later as Isabella, or The Fatal Marriage. The Fatal Marriage is yet another play based on the story of a woman. Like many of his other plays, this too was considered a comedy. Isabella wishes to mourn her lost husband. Isabella finds herself feeling lonely and an outcast from the rest of society. Living in this relatively new world without her husband, Isabella finds herself raped and taken of her innocence by an admirable man in the play who goes by Villeroy. Southerne uses character techniques within Villeroy to display the once innocence of Isabella which enhanced the theme of the play. Southerne was admired for his character technique and was skilled at creating realistic characters and enhancing other characters with the use of newly created personalities.Kaufman The play was considered to be a tragedy and a serious topic of that time period. Due to the intense tragedy in the play, it became a rather big hit on the stage in which many actresses fought to play the lead role of Isabella and was soon translated from a multitude of languages to be presented on many stages around the world. The general spirit of his comedies is well exemplified by a line from Sir Anthony Love (1691) \\"every day a new mistress and a new quarrel.\\" This comedy, in which the part of the heroine, disguised as Sir Anthony Love, was excellently played by Mrs Mountfort, was his best. He scored another conspicuous success in Oroonoko, or The Royal Slave (1696). For the plot of this he was again indebted to the novel by Aphra Behn.  Later works  The Wives' Excuse (1669) was a play Southerne wrote in the late 1660s. This play was a comedy in which focused on the idea of a woman trapped in an unhealthy marriage. It was one of its kind in that time period and dramatized a serious, intelligent woman living in a corrupt and unethical society. During this time, divorce was a difficult issue to overcome and go through with. The woman, Mrs.Friendall was dismissed by her husband and later resulted in a liking for her suitor. Overall, the play touches up on the subject of inequality in terms of men in relation to women. At the end of the play, although Mrs. Friendall acted with great dignity after being brought down frequently, she remains stuck in her unwanted marriage while the men in the play seem unaffected by any of the circumstances. As so, The Wives' Excuse did not get too many likings by the public as it seemed like the play may have been too foolish for such a serious topic and was dismissed as stupid and thoughtless. The Maid's Last Prayer was yet another unliked piece by society as it was considered too harsh of a subject for the people living in the mid to late 1690s, although it was unliked, it was not necessarily a lack of success.Hume Often in Thomas Southerne's plays he depicted woman as greedy, selfish, and likely to commit sin. In this piece, a notable character Lady Trickett is considered to be a dirty, sinful woman unworthy of marriage. The play focuses on women such as Lady Trickett being rejected by a seemingly male-dominated society. As so, the message is clear in the play as it is for that time period, women who were sinful and simply not pure were not worthy of marriage and a happy life. As so, Southerne's later pieces did not secure any great successes, but he contrived to gain better returns from his plays than Dryden did, and he remained a favorite with his contemporaries and with the next literary generation. He died on 26 May 1746. His other plays are: The Disappointment, or the Mother in Fashion (1684), founded in part on the Curioso Imperlinente in Don Quixote; The Wives Excuse (1969), or Cuckolds make themselves (1692); The Maids Last Prayer; or Any rather than fail (1692); The Fate of Capua (1700); The Spartan Dame (1719), taken from Plutarch's Life of Aegis; and Money the Mistress (1726). His work is collected as Plays written by Thomas Southerne, with an Account of the Life and Writings of the Author (1774).

Taxonomy The taxonomy of this species is somewhat unclear, even amongst researchers. Most commonly, two subspecies are recognized: *P. m. multivirgatus (Hallowell, 1857) ‚Äì northern many-lined skink *P. m. epipleurotus (Cope, 1880) ‚Äì variable skink The latter is sometimes treated as a separate species Plestiodon epipleurotus or Plestiodon gaigeae (Taylor, 1935), or given as the subspecies P. m. gaigeae. These last two scientific names are in honor of American herpetologist Helen Beulah Thompson Gaige (1890-1976) of the University of Michigan.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

Description The many-lined skink is a medium-sized skink reaching a maximum length from snout to vent (SVL) of about and a total length of roughly . Its body is olive to brown in color. P. m. multivirgatus has black stripes along the body and tail, while P. m. epipleurotus has two white stripes with black borders. Geographic range & habitat The geographic range of P. m. multivirgatus is limited in the north by southern South Dakota, Nebraska, and Wyoming and extends in the south to the Arkansas River in Colorado. P. m. multivirgatus prefers sandy soil and occurs in habitat below . P. m. epipleurotus occurs from south-eastern Utah and southern Colorado through Arizona, New Mexico, and western Texas to Chihuahua in Mexico. It lives in rocky habitat up to elevations of .
