The Bosnian style can be compared with Scandinavian National Romanticism.About Art Nouveau The Bosnian Style was championed by a younger generation of architects, like Czech architect Josip Pospo≈°il, Slovene architect Rudolf T√∂nnies, and Austrian architect Ernst Lichtblau, who all studied at the Art Academy in Vienna with Karl von Hasenauer and Otto Wagner. The style was, however, named by Sarajevo‚Äôs senior architect, Josip Vanca≈°, for whom many of these younger architects worked.Emily Gunzburger Makas, Tanja Damljanovic Conley (eds.) Capital Cities in the Aftermath of Empires Although the Bosnian style was lauded as more sympathetic in its local inspiration, Gunzberger-Makas and Damljanovic-Conley argue that its stress remained on the Islamic component of Bosnian vernacular architecture, often with historical rather than contemporary sources. The shift from Moorish Revival to Bosnian Style was thus \\"the substitution of one historicist collage for another\\", in which pan-Islamic motifs were replaced with pan-vernacular motifs, ambiguously connecting Ottoman architecture with that of the present, and wrongly suggesting theses motives to be specifically Bosnian, while they are found throughout the Ottoman Balkans. The Bosnian Style may thus be \\"best understood as within the tradition of national romanticism\\", although its designers were not from within the nation they aimed to represent. As it still focused on the differences from Western and Central Europe, and it did not change the power relations about the scripted, imperial interpretations of local architecture, the Bosnian Style was no less Orientalist than Moorish Revival.  Development of Bosnian style  During its reign, the Austro-Hungarian authorities sought to impose and build architecture of European styles in Bosnia and Herzegovina and thus to show the meaning of their mission in the occupied country. Initially, it offered historic styles that built the most representative buildings of the second half of the 19th century in Vienna. In Bosnia, too much was built in foreign building styles, primarily historicism, and too little appreciated, respected, and used the vernacular Bosnian methods of building. Confronted with the multinational population structure in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the government realized that it was necessary to have a political ear when choosing one of the historical styles. For construction in areas where the Bosniak population was predominant, architects used the Moorish Revival style. Over time, it turned out that this style did not fit, as well as others, because it did not arise in the development of architectural thought and practice based on indigenous architectural heritage. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, there was a movement amongst architects and engineers towards creating a truly Bosnian style. = Ernst Lichtblau = Viennese architect Ernst Lichtblau, apprentice of Otto Wagner, in 1904, studied the ancient residential architecture throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina, seeking to create a modern style based on these indigenous forms. His work in Bosnia is one example of the Wagner School's contact with architecture in Bosnia and Herzegovina. His drawings were published in 1907 in the journal Der Architekt. They depict groups of old houses under the Jajce Fortress. He was impressed by the cascading and cubist forms of the roofs, the simple but powerful shapes of the houses, modeled by light and fine valers of scale black, white and brown. Thanks to the Art Nouveau interpretation of the contents, in them the old architecture of Bosnia manifested its hidden and subtle artistic values, reaching the level at which the points of contact with modern architecture showed themselves. In another group of drawings, Lichtblau seeks to create houses or buildings for contemporary needs, contemporary forms and construction. Some drawings show an effort to create a typical house that would take the form of an old residential architecture, some again represent the example of a representative house - villas for Bosnia - of course again designed and designed according to the same principle. The project for a house in Bosnia was created as early as 1904, so that date can be taken as the beginning of the development or search for a Bosnian style. Because in that Lichtblau project there are already significant components of the old Bosnian architecture - such as the elevated position of the house, the terraced access zone, the environment where the green is very significant is carefully cultivated, the house is enclosed by a high wall around a narrow courtyard. The house itself - the villa - shows that the architect respects the one-story elevation of the old houses; the house has latticework on the corner - with moldings - windows, a high pyramidal roof, white walls, size and proportion, elements and whole derived from old houses and built to new standards. Lichtblau goes a step further. He designed a villa in Vienna in full Bosnian style, giving this architectural expression European and universal legitimacy. Lichtbau designs the State Forest Directorate's project as a modern building with the characteristics of a centrally developed layout of a Bosnian apartment building. = Josip Vanca≈° = In his first search for a Bosnian style, Josip Vanca≈° himself studied old houses, made sketches, studies and worked on the recording of characteristic objects and entities. He advocated indigenous construction and the incorporation of Bosnia's centuries-old tradition into contemporary architecture. As a Representative at the Diet of Bosnia, Vanca≈° submitted to the Bosnian Parliament in 1911 a resolution in which these architects expressed their views on the architectural heritage in Bosnia and Herzegovina and proposals for the preservation and use of architectural landmarks. The Resolution called on the Land Government to take appropriate measures to list all older and public and private buildings and construction monuments, to place state monuments under the protection of the state, to draw these buildings with drawings and photographs, and to prepare a legal basis - for new buildings in the Bosnian style enjoyed benefits and tax breaks. The resolution itself did not produce some definite results, although it was accepted by the Government. = Josip Pospi≈°il = In 1909, architect Josip Pospi≈°il arrived in Sarajevo, and immediately began studying indigenous heritage in urbanism and architecture, fighting for their protection and restoration. He propagated the \\"Bosnian style\\", looking for models in his immediate vicinity. Pospi≈°il in 1912 appeared in the renowned magazine Der Bautechniker with several professional articles in which he also informs the foreign cultural public about the problems of current construction practice and theory in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Then he published several of his projects and, among them, a perspective view of the future building of the Sarajevo Fire Brigade barracks. Pospi≈°il's 1912 Fire Brigade barracks was one key Bosnian Style public building actually built in the provincial capital. A mixture of modern styles, it had functionalist tendencies in its near lack of ornament, a fa√ßade organisation described as Secessionist in spirit, and an Expressionist depiction of both structure and function. It also had a roof profile and projecting wooden bay windoes reminiscent of Bosnian vernacular architecture. Pospi≈°il's designs on the Radnik Pharmacy, a residential and commercial four-storey building in Tito's 34 (Salom PalaceBNN), Musafija Palace, Sebilj (public kiosk fountain) on Ba≈°ƒçar≈°ija Square, are examples of expansion of the Bosnian-style.

With this project, Vanca≈° makes a greater departure from the Vienna Secession principle of the facade organization, most notably in the freedom of rhythmization of the wall plans and forms of doxat. The central doxat is irregularly convex, two storeys in size, with the top all in wood and glass, like a divanhana at a Bosnian house. Angular doxate is a pentagonal plan. * The residential-business corner of Ba≈°ƒçar≈°ija from 1911 is an expression of respect found with: a stone ground floor, rich doxata, attic windows with a classic broken arch, a closed fence and a pointed roof with a carved fringe.

The ninth named storm of the 2019 Pacific typhoon season, Lekima originated from a tropical depression that formed east of the Philippines on July 30\\\\. It gradually organized, became a tropical storm, and was named on August 4. Lekima intensified under favorable environmental conditions and peaked as a Category 5 typhoon‚Äìequivalent hurricane. However, an eyewall replacement cycle caused the typhoon to weaken before it made landfall in Zhejiang late on August 9, as a Category 2‚Äìequivalent typhoon. Lekima weakened subsequently while moving across Eastern China, and made its second landfall in Shandong on August 11. Lekima's precursor enhanced the southwestern monsoon in the Philippines, which brought heavy rain to the country. The rains caused three boats to sink and 31 people died in this accident. Lekima brought catastrophic damage in mainland China, with a death toll of 56 people and more than CN¬•65.37 billion (US$9.26 billion) in damages. The system also caused minor damage in Ryukyu Islands and Taiwan. In Malaysia, the typhoon brought up strong tides and partially destroyed the coastal areas of Penang. Meteorological history On August 2, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began to monitor a tropical depression which developed over the Philippine Sea. The next day, the PAGASA would later name it as \\"Hanna\\". The system slowly developed while moving northward. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also monitored the system and gave the identifier 10W early on August 4. The JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and assigned the name Lekima at 6:00 a.m. UTC that day. The JTWC followed suit later that day. Though Lekima was affected by moderate wind shear, warm waters of and good outflow channel allowed Lekima to slowly intensify, and Lekima became almost stationary due to the absence of steering current. On August 6, Lekima steered by a subtropical ridge to the northeast and accelerated to the northwest, and the JMA upgraded Lekima to a severe tropical storm. Later that day, both JMA and JTWC upgraded Lekima to a typhoon, after the system developed a central dense overcast. As Lekima continued to move northwestward, the system moved into an area of low wind shear, and it started a process of rapid intensification on August 7. The eye became evident on satellite imagery. On August 8, the JTWC upgraded Lekima to a super typhoon, and stated that the system had acquired some of the annular characteristics. Later that day, the JMA stated that Lekima attained maximum sustained winds of . At the same time, Lekima passed between Miyako-jima and Tarama-jima. Shortly thereafter, Lekima began an eyewall replacement cycle. The typhoon developed a concentric eyewall, as seen from the radar. This cycle also caused the motion of Lekima slightly veered to the north, and the JTWC downgraded Lekima back to typhoon late on August 8. The same day, PAGASA reported that \\"Hanna\\" exited their Philippine Area of Responsibility. Environmental conditions in East China Sea became less favourable, causing Lekima to slowly weaken while approaching East China. At 1:45 a.m. China Standard Time (UTC+08:00) August 10, Lekima made landfall in Wenling, Zhejiang with two-minute sustained winds of . Lekima quickly weakened and turned to the north, along the western side of the subtropical ridge. Lekima dropped below typhoon intensity early on August 10, and weakened further to a tropical storm later that day. Lekima emerged into the Yellow Sea early on August 11, and made second landfall in Xihai'an, Qingdao, Shandong at 8:50 p.m. CST, with two-minute sustained winds of . The JTWC issued its final warning to the system around that time. Lekima meandered over the Shandong Peninsula and Bohai Sea throughout August 12, and the JMA downgraded it to a tropical depression later that day. Preparations and impact =Philippines= As Lekima moved northwestward and approached the northern part of the Philippines, PAGASA issued PSWS#1 to Batanes and the Babuyan Islands late on August 6. These warnings were lifted after Lekima left the Philippine Area of Responsibility. Though Lekima, locally known as \\"Hanna\\", did not directly affect the Philippines, it enhanced the southwest monsoon which caused heavy rain to the nation. Three boats sank in Guimaras Strait; 31 people died and three were left missing. Heavy rains also caused flooding in Metro Manila. Classes of numerous cities were suspended on August 5. A motorboat carrying 10 passengers capsized off the coast of Mactan Island in the early morning of August 7. To the south, waves from Lekima displaced more than 1,300 people in Davao City. Agricultural damage in Central Luzon was at ‚Ç±80.5 million (US$1.55 million). =Ryukyu Islands= As Lekima approached the southwestern Ryukyu Islands, Ishigaki-jima and Miyako-jima received a storm warning. The JMA urged the residents on these islands to beware of high waves, heavy rain, and sudden gusts. Gusts in Miyako-jima reached , while gusts in Shimojishima Airport and Iriomote-jima reached and respectively. Six people were injured during the storm, and thousands of families suffered from power outages. Hundreds of flights and passenger ship trips were cancelled on August 7‚Äì9, mainly in Miyako-jima and Ishigaki-jima, affecting thousands of passengers. Agricultural damage across the island chain was JP¬•347 million (US$3.29 million). =Taiwan= Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau (CWB) issued a sea warning on August 7. As Lekima continued to approach the island, the CWB issued a land warning to the northern part of Taiwan early on the next day, locally. The CWB lifted the land warning late on August 9, and lifted the sea warning early on the next day, after Lekima made landfall in East China. On late August 8, school and work were cancelled for the next day in eight municipalities and counties in the northern part of Taiwan and in the Matsu Islands. Hundreds of flights and ships were cancelled and delayed. Throughout Taiwan, Lekima killed two people and injured 15 others. More than 80,000 families suffered power outages. On August 8‚Äì9, Wufeng Township recorded a rainfall total of , while rainfall in Taichung amounted to . Lekima's downdraft affected Kinmen on August 9, where a farmland recorded temperature of , setting the national record for the second highest temperature. Jinfeng Township also recorded a temperature of . Institutional damage of Lekima, along with a magnitude 6.0 earthquake reached NT$5.24 million (US$167,000). =Mainland China= Typhoon Lekima uprooted a tree in Xianju County, Zhejiang. Striking East China as a super typhoon, according to China Meteorological Administration, Lekima wrought major damage across numerous provinces. In all, the typhoon killed 56 people and left 14 others missing. Damage nationwide exceeds CN¬•65.37 billion (US$9.26 billion). Zhejiang was the worst hit province; 45 people died in the province, and economic loss reached CN¬•45.38 billion (US$6.43 billion). Most of those killed died because of landslides in Yongjia County, and the landslides blocked a river. Water levels rose in ten minutes, and many residents could not evacuate in time. Wenling recorded peak wind gusts of , while daily rainfall in Beilun District amounted to . Lekima also brought significant effects in Shandong, where 5 people were killed, 7 remain missing, and the damage statewide amounted to over CN¬•16 billion (US$2.27 billion). Because Lekima looped around Shandong for days, it brought heavy rainfall in the province. Daily rainfall in Linqu County reached . =Malaysia= The tail front of Lekima stretched south to Malaysia and struck the northern states of the Malay Peninsula on August 9, which killed a person, left one missing while injuring ten others in the states of Kedah, Penang and Perak. The storm also caused damage to 329 schools, and the damage was about RM20 million (US$4.77 million). Wind speeds in some areas were recorded at . Hundreds of trees were uprooted. 1,358 houses in Kedah were damaged by Lekima. Total damage in Malaysia reached RM60.2 million (US$14.4 million). Retirement Due to the severe impact in China, the name Lekima was retired during the 52nd annual session of the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee in February 2020. A replacement name will be chosen in early 2021.

Donovan (April 22, 1914 ‚Äì March 11, 1995) was an American aerospace engineer and systems engineer who was involved in the development of the Atlas and Titan rocket families. He served as a consultant to the President's Science Advisory Committee from 1957 until 1978. Biography Allen F. Donovan was born in Onondaga, New York, on April 22, 1914. He graduated from the University of Michigan in 1936 with Bachelor of Science in Engineering (BSE) and Master of Science degrees. After graduation he began working for Curtiss-Wright, where his first assignment was strengthening the wings of the Curtiss Hawk biplane. During World War II, Donovan worked on Curtiss fighters including the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, and became head of structural and flight research at the Curtiss-Wright Research Laboratory, which he helped to create. His wartime work involved structural and flutter testing of dive bombers such as the Curtiss SB2C Helldiver and the Vought F4U Corsair. He also worked for the Manhattan Project on the design of the shape of the Fat Man atomic bomb and its release mechanism. After the war ended, Curtiss-Wright donated the Curtiss-Wright Research Laboratory to Cornell University, and it became the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory in January 1946. Donovan became head of its aeromechanics department. He designed the STV-1 rocket, the first U.S. supersonic vehicle, and investigated the science and technology of supersonic flight. He pioneered the use of composite materials for helicopter blades, and headed the team that developed the US Army's Lacrosse missile. He also served on the US Air Force (USAF) Scientific Advisory Board from 1948 to 1968. In this role, in 1954, he rejected plans to modify the Martin B-57 Canberra to fly reconnaissance missions over the Soviet Union, and supported the development of the Lockheed CL-282, which became the U-2 spyplane. In 1955, Donovan joined the Ramo-Wooldridge, and moved to California. At this time Ramo-Wooldridge was involved in the development of the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). As head of its aeronautics laboratory, he headed the development of the re-entry vehicles for the Atlas rocket family, and later for Titan and Thor. In 1958, he convinced the Advanced Research Projects Agency to sponsor Pioneer 1, an attempt to photograph the far side of the Moon with a probe built by Ramo-Wooldridge and launched by a Thor rocket. Pioneer 1 failed to reach the Moon but returned the first measurements of the density of micrometeorites and the interplanetary magnetic field. When the USAF decided in 1960 that future systems engineering would be provided by a non-profit organization formed for the purpose, Donovan joined The Aerospace Corporation, which had its headquarters in El Segundo, California, as its senior vice president, technical. He worked with the president of the corporation, Ivan A. Getting, to build it into an organization with two thousand scientists and engineers. He worked with NASA to solve the problem of combustion instability that affected Project Mercury, and later on the pogo oscillation problems that affected Project Gemini and Project Apollo. He conditioned to serve with the USAF as an advisor, and was chairman of its propulsion panel from 1959 to 1968, and was involved with the highly-secret National Reconnaissance Office. Between 1957 and 1978 he served as a consultant to the President's Science Advisory Committee and on several of its panels. The USAF awarded him the Air Force Civilian Exceptional Service Medal in 1968. Donovan became a member of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics in 1943, and was elected a fellow in 1963, and an honorary fellow in 1983. In 1964, the University of Michigan awarded him an honorary Doctor of Science in aeronautical and astronomical engineering. He was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 1969, and served on the National Research Council's board of review of the Space Shuttle Main Engine.

It is Gothic in style, built mostly of tooled granite rubble, and has a cruciform layout with an east‚Äìwest oriented nave, transepts to the north and south, and a slender tower at the south-west corner. Its interior is lavishly decorated with polished granite columns topped with ornately carved capitals, marble chancel furniture, and many stained glass windows depicting saints and biblical scenes. St Margaret's was built between 1875 and 1879 by Alexander Ross and largely paid for by Margaret Macpherson Grant, an heiress who had inherited a large fortune from her uncle Alexander Grant, a slave-owning merchant and planter who had become rich in Jamaica. The church was built as the chapel for an orphanage that she founded in the town; the orphanage has since been demolished, but the church continues to be used for weekly services, and has been designated a Category A listed building. Description St Margaret's Church is located in a secluded woodland setting, at the end of a long drive leading uphill from Aberlour's High Street. It is a large cruciform church, built to a Gothic design, made of tooled pink granite with contrasting ashlar detailing. =Exterior= The church has a tall, five-bay nave, oriented east‚Äìwest, with a steeply pitched slate roof and lean-to side aisles. The west gable features a four-light window with geometric Gothic tracery. A chancel, somewhat narrower and shorter than the rest of the building, protrudes from the eastern end of the nave; its east gable has lancet windows, the central one taller than the outer two, all below a single continuous hood mould. There are north and south transepts, each buttressed and with two tall lancet windows on their gable ends, and single lancets on their sides; the north transept also has steps leading up to a small door in its side. At the south-west corner there is a slender, octagonal spire, incorporating a belfry and topped with a copper covering. Adjoining this is a large gabled porch, which provides the main entrance to the building, through a large arched doorway inscribed with the words \\"This is none other but the house of God.\\" Above the doorway is a niche with a statue of St Margaret, and the arch itself is supported by columns with ornately carved capitals. The burial ground, which is partially walled and accessed via a pair of rubble gate piers, contains three foundation stones from the now- demolished Aberlour Orphanage, and a war memorial dedicated to boys from the orphanage who died in the First and Second World Wars. =Interior= The interior of the church is richly decorated with ornate stonework. The nave's side-aisles' arcade arches are supported by thick columns of polished pink granite with octagonal ashlar bases and ornately carved sandstone capitals, produced by Dawson & Strachan, and it is lined with wooden pews with carved ends. The central aisle has a decorative tile floor, and the nave has numerous stained glass windows by G. J. Baguley of Newcastle, depicting various saints. The north and south transepts do not open into the nave, but instead serve as a vestry on the north, and an organ loft on the south. At the west end of the nave is a font, with an elaborately carved wooden cover that originally came from Christ Church in Lancaster Gate, which was demolished in 1977. The focus of the church is its chancel, at the east end of the building, which is raised up above the level of the nave and separated by an intricate metal rood screen. The chancel houses an array of original furniture, including sedilia, a reredos and altar, all intricately carved in Caen stone, also by Dawson & Strachan, and a brass tabernacle, designed to appear mediaeval, by J. W. Singer and Sons, who also made the sanctuary lamp. There is an elaborately decorative tiled floor, by Minton & Co, and a stone pulpit, raised on a column, by D. and A. Davidson of Inverness. The trio of windows in the east gable feature stained glass, depicting the crucifixion and other biblical events. History St Margaret's Church was built between 1875 and 1879 by Alexander Ross, and was originally used as the chapel for the Aberlour Orphanage that was built at the same time. The construction of both was mostly paid for by a local benefactor to the Episcopal Church, Margaret Macpherson Grant. Macpherson Grant, born Margaret Gordon Macpherson, was the niece of Alexander Grant, an Aberlour-born slave-owner, planter and merchant who made a substantial fortune in Jamaica. Having commissioned William Robertson to build Aberlour House (now in use as a school) for him, he returned to Aberlour in 1838. He divided his time between Aberlour and London for the rest of his life, and died in 1854. He had no children, and left his entire estate, valued at ¬£300,000 (), to his niece, who added 'Grant' to her name and moved into Aberlour House, continuing to manage her uncle's Jamaican estates through an agent. She used her fortune to pay for the building of the church and the orphanage, amongst other gifts to the Episcopal Church, but died in 1877 before their construction was completed. William Grant of Elchies paid for the ongoing construction, and the church was completed by 22 November 1879. The proceeding years saw various improvements and additions to the church: the stained glass windows were installed between 1887 and 1907; the marble chancel furniture was added in 1900; the pulpit was installed in 1936; and the wooden font cover, recovered from a now-demolished church in London, was gifted by the Findlay family in 1978.

Holy Guardian Angels is a former Catholic parish of the Diocese of Sioux City. The historic district made up of the former parish church and cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019. It is significant for the architecture of the Gothic Revival church and the influence of the German- Catholic immigrants who settled the area. Church Lambert Kniest bought of land in Carroll County that would become known as Mount Carmel. Bishop John Hennessy of Dubuque sent German Catholics to settle the area and start farms. They established the county's first Catholic church in 1868. Catholics from Roselle traveled there for Mass until 1874 when they founded their own parish and built a frame church, which the called Heilige Schutzengels Kirche (Holy Guardian Angels Church). Except for four families who were Lutheran, the community was made up of Catholics. Carroll County would grow to have the highest concentration of German Americans of any county in Iowa. As the parish and town grew they needed a new church, and they built the present structure in 1904. There was no railroad into Roselle, so the building materials had to be hauled into the town using horse-drawn wagons on primitive roads. It took more than a year to build the church and cost the parish $48,000. The brick Gothic Revival church features an Indiana limestone foundation and a central tower that rises . The vaulted ceiling in the interior rises above gilded altars, numerous statues of saints and angels, elaborate stained glass windows, frescos, and mosaics. The last renovation of the church was carried out by Langenfeld Studios in 1929. A parochial school was established by the parish in 1888, and the Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration from La Crosse, Wisconsin began teaching there in 1899. There was a dormitory for the students who boarded there in the winter months. The parish added a junior high school building in 1916, and the parish schools served the community until they were incorporated into the Kuemper Catholic School System in Carroll in 1975. In 1977, the original school building was torn down and the junior high building was moved to a different location. The Diocese of Sioux City has subsequently closed Holy Guardian Angels Parish. The Holy Angels Church and Cemetery Foundation was incorporated with the State of Iowa in 1995 to care for the parish property. Cemetery The parish cemetery is located to the north of the church. Its earliest burial is from 1863. The grave markers include obelisk and cross designs and iron crosses that were possibly made by local blacksmiths, which would have been the custom for that time. Numerous markers are engraved with German script.

It was the seventh time the National Eisteddfod of Wales had been held in Cardiff. The 2018 event was billed as the Eisteddfod with \\"No fences\\" because it dispensed with the traditional enclosed 'Maes', or entrance fees to the event location. It made a ¬£290,000 loss, but its popularity led to the suggestion of future Eisteddfods without fences. Background The National Eisteddfod of Wales has been held every year (with the exception of 1914) since 1861. It is hosted by a different region of Wales each year. Since 1950 all competitions have been held in Welsh. Around 6,000 competitions are held, in poetry, music, dance, drama and literature, giving it a claim to be the largest music and poetry festival in Europe. The main competition events are the Crowning of the Bard and the Chairing of the Bard. The 2018 Eisteddfod was the seventh time it had been held in Cardiff. It was held for the first time in Cardiff in 1883, subsequently in 1899, 1938, 1960, 1978 and 2008. The 2008 Cardiff Eisteddfod was held in Pontcanna Fields, with a traditional fenced 'Maes' (festival grounds). Preparations In August 2015 the Eisteddfod's chief executive, Elfed Roberts, announced he was in discussions with Cardiff Council about the idea of holding the 2018 event in permanent buildings in Cardiff city centre, rather than the traditional Maes. In April 2016 the Eisteddfod backed the plans, as a one-year experiment to attract more visitors, though the event would be held in Cardiff Bay rather than the city centre. Existing buildings in the Bay area, such as the Wales Millennium Centre, would be used. The plan was designed to avoid rent and reparation costs, possibly of up to ¬£500,000, needed to site the Eisteddfod again in one of the public parks. The target of ¬£320,000 fundraising had been met a month before the Eisteddfod was due to start. The Maes The main event locations of the Maes were sited around Roald Dahl Plass and the marina of Cardiff Bay. The Wales Millennium Centre became the main 'Pavilion' and 'Y Babell L√™n' (Literature Pavilion), with daily tickets available for ¬£10. The Pierhead Building hosted an 80th anniversary art exhibition by the Contemporary Art Society for Wales. It also performed the role of 'Maes D' (the Learners Area), in 2018 called 'Shw'mae Caerdydd'. The Senedd building hosted 'Y Lle Celf' (English: The Art Place) with exhibitions of Wales' best contemporary art, craft and design. The meeting rooms of the Senedd also became the Societies Pavillions. 'Maes B', traditionally the pop and rock music event, was held in the vacant Doctor Who Experience building 'Caffi Maes B', 'Ty Gwerin' (folk music) and 'Sinemaes' (the cinema) were held in large tents nearby. The Welsh College of Music and Drama held concerts of harp, piano and woodwind music in the Norwegian Church. Coronau, an exhibition of previous National Eisteddfod crowns, took place in Craft in the Bay. Camping was available further afield, with 338 camping places for families at Pontcanna Fields and the 'Maes B' campsite (for younger revellers) at Fitzalan High School in Leckwith. Aftermath In November it was announced that the Cardiff Eisteddfod had made an overall loss of ¬£290,000. This was largely because of additional security requirements of the open event. The festival cost ¬£4 million to stage. An estimated 500,000 visitors had attended the Eisteddfod, three times more than the 2017 event. Prior to 2018, the National Eisteddfod had made a profit every year since 2012, with a ¬£93,000 surplus in 2017 despite the Anglesey festival almost being cancelled by the weather. The Eisteddfod council said that more public money would be needed to fund the tourism aspect and make similar open events viable in the future. In October 2018, a public meeting was held in Caernarfon to promote the idea of holding the 2021 National Eisteddfod in the town using existing permanent buildings. In May 2019 the Urdd Eisteddfod held its first festival without admission fees, which also took place in Cardiff Bay, with more than 100 stalls. The 2019 National Eisteddfod returned to the usual fenced Maes with daily entrance fees of ¬£20 for visitors. However, the Presiding Officer of the National Assembly for Wales, Elin Jones, announced she was keen to support a fenceless Eisteddfod for the 2020 event in Tregaron.

The regiment fought at Shiloh, Perryville, and Stones River in 1862, Chickamauga in 1863, the Atlanta Campaign, Allatoona, and Nashville in 1864, and Spanish Fort and Fort Blakeley in 1865. The remaining 87 officers and men surrendered to Federal forces in May 1865. Two of the regiment's commanding officers were promoted brigadier general. History =Formation= The 9th Texas Infantry Regiment was formed on 4 November 1861 from 10 companies recruited in northeast Texas. The regiment was accepted into the Confederate States Army on 1 December under West Point graduate Samuel B. Maxey of Paris, Texas as colonel. The other field officers were Lieutenant Colonel William E. Beeson and Major Wright A. Stanley. Captain James Hill formed a cavalry company on 10 June 1861 and drilled it near a persimmon grove at Petty, Texas. Believing the militia laws would not allow cavalry units to leave the state, the company later disbanded. The men reformed as Company E of the 9th Texas Infantry and entered Confederate service on 26 November 1861. On 4 March 1862, Maxey received promotion to brigadier general. At this time, Stanley was promoted to colonel commanding the 9th Texas and Scottish immigrant James Burnet became major. The regiment would serve longer than any other Texas regiment in the Army of Mississippi and Army of Tennessee. Altogether, 1,018 soldiers would serve with the regiment during the war. =1862= On 26 March 1862 at Corinth, Mississippi the 9th Texas was assigned to James Patton Anderson's brigade in Daniel Ruggles's division from Braxton Bragg's II Corps. The regiment was brigaded with the 1st Florida Infantry Battalion, Confederate Guards Response Battalion, 17th Louisiana and 20th Louisiana Infantry Regiments, and 5th Company Washington Artillery. At the Battle of Shiloh on 6‚Äì7 April 1862, Anderson's brigade lost 69 killed, 313 wounded, and 52 missing, a total of 434 casualties. Anderson's brigade was initially deployed on the left flank of the second line, with Randall L. Gibson's brigade on its right and Preston Pond, Jr.'s brigade on its left. Within the brigade, the 1st Florida was on the right of the 9th Texas and the 20th Louisiana on the left. The brigade was soon in the front line where it drove the Union right wing back and overran two enemy batteries. When the Federal right wing retreated after several hours of fighting, Anderson swung his brigade to the right to join the struggle against the Union center. On the second day, the 9th Texas counterattacked the advancing Federal troops but was compelled to retreat. After detaching two companies, the 9th Texas took 226 troops into the battle and lost 14 killed, 42 wounded, and 11 missing. After Shiloh, the regiment was reorganized with a new colonel, William Hugh Young, a 24 year old graduate of the University of Virginia. Miles A. Dillard became lieutenant colonel and Burnet retained his rank as major. At the Battle of Perryville on 6 October 1862, the 9th Texas was assigned to Preston Smith's brigade in Benjamin F. Cheatham's division. The Texans were brigaded with the 12th Tennessee, 13th Tennessee, 47th Tennessee, and 154th Tennessee Infantry Regiments, plus Scott's Tennessee Battery. Smith's brigade was the last Confederate unit to arrive at mid-morning and deployed just to the south of Perryville. After being repulsed in its attack on Philip Sheridan's Union division, Samuel Powell's brigade fell back across the Chaplin River. Smith's brigade formed a line behind Powell's men. There was no Federal pursuit because the corps commander Charles Champion Gilbert forbade it. On the morning of 7 October, as Preston Smith's brigade began to march away from the battlefield, Federal artillery fire killed one Texan. At the Battle of Stones River on 31 December 1862‚Äì2 January 1863, the regiment was in the brigade led by Alfred Jefferson Vaughan Jr.. The brigade included the same units as at Perryville, plus the 29th Tennessee, Allin's Sharpshooters, and an artillery battery. During the fighting Cheatham failed to coordinate the attacks made by the brigades under his command, some claimed because he was drunk. Vaughan's brigade went into action in a cramped position, so the brigade commander ordered the 9th Texas to operate with S. A. M. Wood's brigade on its left flank. After an initial success, Vaughn's Tennesseans fell back, but the 9th Texas kept going. The Texans soon found themselves in a deadly crossfire for thirty minutes between the 35th Illinois Infantry Regiment to their front and the 38th Illinois to their rear. Colonel Young finally seized the battle flag and led a charge that drove off the 35th Illinois. Unfortunately, Vaughan's brigade came up against Phillip Sheridan's Union division which was defending itself stubbornly. Out of 323 men in the 9th Texas, its losses were 18 killed, 102 wounded, and two missing. Colonel Young was wounded. Total casualties for Vaughan's brigade were 707 of which there were 105 killed, 564 wounded, and 38 missing. =1863‚Äì1865= William H. Young On 21 January 1863, the 9th Texas became part of Mathew Ector's brigade in which it remained for the rest of the war. The brigade's other units were the dismounted 10th Texas Cavalry, 14th Texas Cavalry, and 32nd Texas Cavalry Regiments. After being posted near Shelbyville, Tennessee, the brigade was sent to Mississippi in May in Joseph E. Johnston's unsuccessful attempt to raise the Siege of Vicksburg. In July 1863 the brigade was in action near Jackson, Mississippi. During the Battle of Chickamauga on 19-20 September 1863, Ector's brigade was part of States Rights Gist's division in William H. T. Walker's corps. In addition to the Texas units, Ector's brigade included Stone's Alabama and Pound's Mississippi Sharpshooter Battalions and the 29th North Carolina Infantry Regiment. Early on the morning of 19 September, John T. Croxton's Federal infantry brigade bumped into a Confederate cavalry brigade led by Henry Brevard Davidson. Nathan Bedford Forrest was nearby and quickly fed infantry brigades under Claudius C. Wilson and Ector into the escalating struggle. Ector's soldiers became involved in a musketry duel with Ferdinand Van Derveer's Union brigade. Without effective artillery support, Ector withdrew his troops from the unequal battle after 30 minutes. Ector and Wilson suffered such heavy losses on the first day that their brigades were each reduced to about 500 men. On 20 September, Gist's division was ordered into action with Peyton H. Colquitt's 980 soldiers in the front line and Ector's and Wilson's men in the second line. The assault failed with heavy losses and Colquitt was killed. Ector's and Wilson's troops covered the retreat of Colquitt's survivors. Ector's brigade lost 59 killed, 239 wounded, and 138 missing in the battle. Out of 145 men present for duty, the 9th Texas lost six killed, 38 wounded, and 18 missing. Ector's brigade transferred to Mississippi for the winter and missed the Battle of Missionary Ridge. The brigade was reassigned to Samuel Gibbs French's division in Leonidas Polk's corps. On 6 April 1864 the 9th Texas soldiers re-enlisted. The 39th North Carolina Infantry Regiment and Jacques's Battalion joined Ector's brigade for the Atlanta Campaign, while the two sharpshooter battalions were no longer in the order of battle. French's 4,174-man division joined Johnston's army on 19 May 1864, after the start of the campaign. During the Atlanta Campaign, the 9th Texas lost 16 killed, 39 wounded, and one captured. In July Ector was wounded and had a leg amputated. Colonel Young replaced him in command of the brigade while Major James H. McReynolds became commander of the 9th Texas. The Battle of Allatoona on 5 October 1864 cost the 9th Texas Infantry 45 casualties. In the Battle of Allatoona on 5 October 1864, the 9th Texas sustained losses of 43 killed or wounded and two missing out of 101 present for duty. Leading the brigade, Young was wounded in a foot which had to be amputated; he was captured and spent the rest of the war in a Federal prison camp. French's division attacked John M. Corse's Union garrison in Allatoona, Georgia and was repulsed after desperate fighting. The victors suffered 707 casualties out of 1,944 soldiers. During John Bell Hood's invasion of Tennessee, the brigade missed the Battle of Franklin because it was guarding the army's pontoon bridges. The 9th Texas fought in the Battle of Nashville on 15‚Äì16 December 1864 as part of Alexander P. Stewart's corps. Ector's brigade was still in French's division and led by Colonel D. Coleman. The spring of 1865 found Ector's brigade defending Mobile, Alabama. In this campaign, Edward Canby led 45,000 Federal troops while Dabney H. Maury commanded 10,000 Confederate soldiers and 300 cannons. In the Battle of Spanish Fort two divisions of the Union XIII Corps under Gordon Granger on the left and two divisions of the Union XVI Corps under Andrew Jackson Smith on the right laid siege to the fort. The defenses were manned by the brigades of Ector, James T. Holtzclaw, and Randall L. Gibson, from left to right. After the Federal troops gained a foothold, the fort was evacuated on the night of 8‚Äì9 April 1865 with the loss of about 50 guns and 500 prisoners. This was followed by the Battle of Fort Blakeley on 9 April when 3,423 Confederate troops were captured. The survivors of Maury's command retreated to Meridian, Mississippi. The remaining eight officers and 79 men of the 9th Texas surrendered and were paroled on 11 May 1865 at Meridian. Instead of handing over the 9th Texas battle flag, Charlie Matthews hid the banner in his shirt and was alleged to have kept it as late as 1909. Colonel Young became an attorney and died in San Antonio in 1901. Captain R. Milton Board of Company I died on 10 April 1931. The last known member of the 9th Texas, R. B. Whisenant died on 1 January 1937.

The village between Coventry and Birmingham was long reputed to be at the geographical centre of England. The national memorial was built in 1920 to commemorate cyclists killed in the First World War (it is now believed that the first British soldier killed in the war was Private John Parr, a reconnaissance cyclist with the 4th Battalion, Middlesex Regiment). A bronze plaque was added in 1963 to commemorate cyclists killed in the Second World War. A committee to organise a national cyclists was memorial was established in November 1919, chaired by the Conservative politician W. G. Howard Gritten, known as the \\"cyclists' MP\\", with the Lord Chancellor, the 1st Earl of Birkenhead as president. Funding of around ¬£1,100 was raised by public donations, including the proceeds from auctioning the Rudge-Whitworth bicycle of the Prince of Wales, later Edward VIII, which was sold for ¬£100 to Rev. Basil Graham Bourchier. The memorial comprises a high obelisk of Cornish grey granite with stepped top, weighing about , standing a square plinth with inscription panel on front, on a square base. An inscription with gold lettering reads \\"TO THE / LASTING MEMORY / OF THOSE / CYCLISTS / WHO DIED IN THE / GREAT WAR 1914 - 1919\\". The memorial was deliberately kept simple in design eschewing cycling symbolism, and located at the heart of England to make it easier for people to visit from around the country. It was constructed in 1920 by stonemasons J White and Sons of Yardley, Birmingham and unveiled on 21 May 1921 by the Earl of Birkenhead, and dedicated by Rev. Bourchier, at a ceremony attended by an estimated 20,000 people including many thousands of cyclists. Around the anniversary of the unveiling, a memorial service is held by the Cyclists' Touring Club in May each year. The memorial was rededicated in 1963, when a plaque was added to commemorate cyclists killed in the Second World War, which reads \\"IN REMEMBRANCE / OF THOSE / CYCLISTS / WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES / IN WORLD WAR II / 1939 - 1945\\". It became a Grade II listed building in 2001. A second plaque was added 2013, commemorating all cyclists who fought and died for their country, dedicated at the remembrance service in May 2014. Nearby is the Grade II listed sandstone monument that by tradition marks the centre of England.

A gunman broke in through a locked door and opened fire inside the centre, hitting no one. He was subdued by three men after a scuffle and turned over to police. The stepsister of the suspect was later found dead in their family home. Norwegian authorities indicted him for terrorism and murder.  Shooting  The suspect was reportedly wearing a uniform and helmet when he entered the mosque, shooting his way through the locked door. He was carrying two shotguns or \\"shotgun-like\\" weapons and a pistol, opening fire in the room, hitting nobody. Prayers had just ended, with only three elders remaining in the mosque. One of the men approached the suspect and pinned him down, moving his weapons away. The two began to struggle, and the suspect poked the man in the left eye. Another of the men in the room then hit the suspect on the head to subdue him. The police were called at 16:07 local time. The suspect was in a chokehold when police arrived at the mosque. He appeared in court two days later, with his face and neck marked by bruises and scratches. The suspect reportedly began a Facebook livestream in the hours preceding his attempt, but this was taken down. Before going to the mosque, he allegedly killed his younger stepsister while she slept in her bed, firing three bullets into her head and one into her chest.  Perpetrator  The suspect is Philip Manshaus, a 21-year-old Norwegian man who lived near the area of the shooting. He was indicted for terrorism and murder. The police have stated that Manshaus is refusing to speak to them, and that he was already known to law enforcement but did not have a criminal background. The national broadcaster NRK spoke with some of his neighbors. One described him as ordinary, saying he had helped her with household tasks before, though another claimed he had not been very happy when he was young, with several neighbors also suggesting that a family bereavement a few years earlier had severely impacted him, and that in the last year he had turned increasingly to religion and extremism. Norwegian police had stated the day after the arrest that they were planning to give the suspect a mental health assessment. In the official questioning session, Manshaus declared that his goal was to intimidate Muslims in Norway. Messages sent by user \\"Philip Manshaus\\" to an EndChan imageboard Shortly before the attempt, someone using the name Philip Manshaus was active on a web forum that has been variously reported as 4chan and 8chan, but was confirmed to be a copycat forum called EndChan. His retrieved messages include telling people that \\"it's my time, i was elected by saint tarrant\\" , asking those he was messaging to \\"bump the Race War thread irl\\", and saying that \\"Valhalla awaits\\". Several intermediary messages had been removed. The messages are seen as praising Brenton Tarrant, the perpetrator of the Christchurch mosque shootings in March 2019, and refer to him as \\"saint tarrant\\". The Christchurch shootings were inspired by, among other things, the 22/7 attacks that happened in Norway in 2011. The user also posted a meme depicting Tarrant, Patrick Crusius, and John T. Earnest as \\"chads\\". All three perpetrated racially and/or religiously motivated gun murders in 2019, including Crusius' attack on a Walmart in El Paso, Texas only a week earlier. Manshaus' posts also reportedly feature him describing himself as the \\"third disciple\\"; internet extremism researchers connect this with the rhetoric of Tarrant, suggesting the other 'disciples' would be Earnest and Crusius. Online, Manshaus has also praised Vidkun Quisling, who headed a domestic Nazi collaborationist regime during World War II, and expressed far- right, anti-immigration views.  Victims  Manshaus' 17-year-old stepsister was found dead in their family home by police. She was born in Jiangxi, China, and adopted at 2 years old by Manshaus' stepmother. Manshaus has been charged with her murder. The injured man was 65-year-old Mohammad Rafiq. During the scuffle with the suspect, Rafiq overpowered and disarmed him before he could attack anyone else in the mosque. He received minor injuries while the suspect tried to break free from a chokehold, including an attempt to gouge out Rafiq's left eye. Rafiq is a Pakistani retired Air Force officer who had been living in Norway for two and a half years and was a frequent visitor to Al- Noor Islamic Center in B√¶rum.  Response  Authorities reported that security in Norway may become increased after the attack, as it occurred during the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, with the Prime Minister raising the national security the following day. The Al-Noor Islamic Centre had already added extra security after the Christchurch mosque shootings. According to local Norwegian media, the mosque said that security would be improved again. The Prime Minister, Erna Solberg, condemned the attack. Solberg and Abid Raja, a Liberal Norwegian politician, spoke together on the day of the attack, assuring the public that places of worship should be safe and calling for plans to break down Islamophobia in the country. Another reaction to the incident was a speech given by Siv Jensen, the leader of the right-wing Progress Party, also referred to Rafiq as a hero. The day after the attack, on the Eid al-Adha celebration day, Solberg and other important figures, as well as the men from the mosque, attended a ceremony in solidarity held in Sandvika. EndChan has deleted the thread that the user with Manshaus' named posted on, and had its primary web domain taken offline following the attack. As the shooting spread in media, so did the actions of Rafiq and the other man in the mosque, which a Danish newspaper described as \\"courageous\\"; several media outlets, primarily in Norway but also some foreign ones, described Rafiq as a \\"hero\\". A Norwegian philanthropist, Elisabeth Norheim, started a fundraising campaign on a Norwegian crowdfunding website. to help raise money so Rafiq and the other man who helped subdue the attack could undertake the hajj. After the initial goal of 55,000 NOK (~ 6100 USD) for the cost of the two to travel was surpassed, with more than 180,000 NOK (~20,000 USD) raised in one day, the organizers said they could also fund the hajj for the third man in the mosque during the attack. The fund raised was later passed the adjusted goal of 230,000 NOK (~25,000 USD). On 15 August 2019, a ceremony was held at the Sandvika Police House to praise Rafiq and the other man for their actions. It was hosted by Beate Gang√•s, the Oslo Police Commander-in-Chief, and Lisbeth Hammer Krogh, the mayor of B√¶rum.  Investigation and criminal proceedings  The Norwegian Police Security Service said that they received a tip about Manshaus approximately one year prior to the attack. After coordinating with the local police department, Oslo Police District, they found that the tip was vague and showed no signs of imminent terror planning activities. The tip was not followed up. Norwegian police reported that they have spoken with Manshaus previously because of his online behavior. On 12 August 2019, in a court hearing in Oslo District Court, Manshaus was put in pre-trial jail for four weeks with no visitation, mail or media access. Manshaus declared himself not guilty and called to be released. = Arrest and charges = On 17 February 2020, Norwegian prosecutors formally charged Manshaus with murder and terror. On 7 May 2020, the suspect appeared in court again where he denied the charges. On 11 June 2020, Manshaus was found guilty of murder and terrorism and sentenced to 21 years in prison along with a provision that he should be imprisoned indefinitely if determined to be a threat to society. = Communication issues = It has been reported that when the members of the mosque called the police, the incident was initially classified as low-priority and the police would not respond; the men struggled trying to convey the situation to the operator. There have also been claims that a user of an online forum had tried to notify the Norwegian police three times that he suspected an attack would happen, but that local police told him to call the FBI. Police say they are aware of this allegation, but that they are not aware of any such call.

Bowman was an American soldier born in Rochester, New York, who had arrived to Great Britain in January 1944, in preparation for the Operation Overlord. After his landing, he served and was wounded in France, on 3 August 1944. He also served in Belgium and Germany. He reached the rank of private first class during this time. He was a member of a platoon of machine gunners who entered a building in Leipzig, and set positions to cover foot soldiers of the U.S. 2nd Infantry who were arriving to a bridge. Soldiers Bowman and Clarence Ridgeway took positions in an open balcony with a clear view of the bridge. One fired the gun, while the other soldier fed it. Ridgeway came inside, leaving Bowman alone firing the gun. When he was reloading the gun, he was shot in the forehead by a snipers bullet who came from the street below and he crumpled in the floor, already dead. War photographer Robert Capa climbed through the balcony window to the flat, where he took a picture of the dead soldier, who laid in the open door, still with the Luftwaffe sheepskin he had looted on his head. He took other pictures who show how his blood spread on the floor, while other soldiers attended to him and to his fellow gunner. The photographs were published on the Life magazine on 14 May 1945, shortly after Germany surrender, with the caption The Picture of the Last Man to Die, which became his official title. They became some of the most iconic images of the World War II. Two years later, Capa said in an interview that ‚ÄúIt was a very clean, somehow very beautiful death and I think that‚Äôs what I remember most from the war‚Äù.

History After the Fast Flux Test Facility and the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II) were decommissioned in 1992 and 1994, respectively, the United States was left with no fast-neutron reactor in its fleet. Fast-neutron research was limited to a few restricted reactors located in Russia, including the Bor-60. To address this problem Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act of 2017 included a provision directing the Department of Energy to begin planning for a fast- neutron source. Congress included $35 million in 2018 and $65 million in 2019 in the budget in support of this. In February 2019, VTR cleared Critical Decision 0, demonstrating a mission need requiring investment, the first in a series of project approvals. At that time, Secretary of Energy Rick Perry announced the start of the Versatile Test Reactor Project. In November 2019, Battelle Energy Alliance, the organization that manages Idaho National Laboratory, made an announcement for a Expression of Interest (EOI) seeking an industry partner to design and construct the VTR. In January 2020, a collaboration between GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy (GEH) and TerraPower supported by Energy Northwest was announced. The potential building sites of the VTR being considered are Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Idaho National Laboratory. After a final design has been completed, the decision to build the VTR is expected to be made in 2022. The Executive Director of the Versatile Test Reactor is Dr. Kemal Pasamehmetoglu. Conceptual Design Four national laboratories, Idaho National Laboratory, Argonne National Lab, Los Alamos National Lab, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory worked with universities and commercial industry to come up with conceptual designs, costs and schedule estimates, and support. The likely design will be a sodium-cooled 300 megawatt reactor based on GE-Hitachi‚Äôs PRISM reactor. The proposed first fuel will utilize a uranium-plutonium-zirconium alloy fuel. Such an alloy fuel was tested previously in the EBR-II reactor. Later reactor fuel could consist of other mixtures and varying enrichments of uranium and plutonium and could use other alloying metals in place of zirconium. There are no power generating facilities planned for the VTR. GE Hitachi and TerraPower, a Washington state-based nuclear company co-founded by Bill Gates, recently joined together to pursue a public-private partnership to construct the Versatile Test Reactor for the U.S. Department of Energy at Idaho National Laboratory. Planned Capabilities The Department of Energy Office of Nuclear Energy (NE), Nuclear Energy Advisory Committee (NEAC) report, \\"Assessment of Missions and Requirements for a New U.S. Test Reactor\\" recommended the need for a US domestic fast-neutron test capability. The considerations for such a capability include *An intense, neutron-irradiation environment with prototypic spectrum to determine irradiation tolerance and chemical compatibility with other reactor materials, particularly the coolant. *Testing that provides a fundamental understanding of materials performance, validation of models for more rapid future development, and engineering-scale validation of materials performance in support of licensing efforts. *A versatile testing capability to address diverse technology options and, sustained and adaptable testing environments. *Focused irradiations, either long- or short-term, with heavily instrumented experimental devices, and the possibility to do in-situ measurements and quick extraction of samples. *An accelerated schedule to regain and sustain U.S. technology leadership and to enable the competitiveness of U.S-based industry entities in the advanced reactor markets. This can be achieved through use of mature technologies for the reactor design (e.g., sodium coolant in a pool-type, metallic-alloy-fueled fast reactor) while enabling innovative experimentation. These planned capabilities are roughly similar to the capabilities of the sodium-cooled fast neutron 400MWth test reactor Fast Flux Test Facility, located at the Hanford Site in the state of Washington, which was decommissioned in 1992. The preliminary requirements that meet these considerations include: *Provide a high peak neutron flux (neutron energy greater than 0.1 MeV) with a prototypic fast-reactor-neutron-energy spectrum; the target flux is 4 √ó 1015 neutrons per square centimeter per second (neutrons/cm2-sec) or greater. *Provide high neutron dose rate for materials testing [quantified as displacements per atom]; the target is 30 displacements per atom per year or greater. *Provide an irradiation length that is appropriate for fast reactor fuel testing; the target is 0.6 to 1 meter. *Provide a large irradiation volume within the core region; the target is 7 liters. *Provide innovative testing capabilities through flexibility in testing configuration and testing environment (coolants) in closed loops. *Provide the ability to test advanced sensors and instrumentation for the core and test positions. *Expedite experiment life cycle by enabling easy access to support facilities for experiments fabrication and post-irradiation examination. *Provide life-cycle management (spent nuclear fuel storage pending ultimate disposal) for the reactor driver fuel (fuel needed to run the reactor) while minimizing cost and schedule impacts. *Make the facility available for testing as soon as possible by using proven technologies with a high technology readiness level. Uses Creating a fast neutron test environment is essential for the development of the next generation of nuclear technologies and reactor designs, many of which rely on fast neutrons to create the sustained chain reaction that generates heat. The VTR will be used in the testing of advanced nuclear fuels, materials, instrumentation, and sensors. It will also allow DOE to modernize its essential nuclear energy research and development infrastructure, and conduct crucial advanced technology and materials testing necessary to re-energize the U.S. nuclear energy industry. Opposition Edwin Lyman, senior scientist and acting director of the Nuclear Safety Project at the non-profit Union of Concerned Scientists, questioned the need for a fast-neutron reactor, stating that existing facilities could be utilized to produce fast neutrons.

He was educated at Borlase School, Marlow, and at St. Paul's School, London, where he distinguished himself both scholastically and on the sports field, being both captain of the school and a member of the school's cricket and football teams 1903‚Äì1904. In 1904 he enrolled with Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he achieved first-class honors in classical Tripos and graduated MA. In 1908 he emigrated to Melbourne, Australia to join the firm of Dalgety & Co but finding his interests lay elsewhere, in late 1910 joined the teaching staff of the Geelong Church of England Grammar School. In 1909 he joined Sydney Church of England Grammar School (\\"Shore\\") as senior housemaster and senior classical master, whose school magazine Torchbearer, gave him a high encomium. His brother Charles Franklin was also a teacher there. In 1915 he successfully applied for the position of headmaster of Melbourne Grammar School, inducted 21 September, then in 1916 enlisted with the First AIF and served overseas, Henry Girdlestone acting headmaster in his absence. He returned in 1919 as Lieut. Franklin, and served at Melbourne Grammar until 24 June 1936, when he retired on medical advice. During his time at \\"Grammar\\" the school roll had doubled and two important buildings, Grimwade House and Creswick House, had been added by donation.

Although the main intent of Vitezoviƒá was to prove that the borders of Croatia (back then part of the Habsburg Monarchy) were originally considerably larger, it grew into a political program based on a separate pan-South Slavic identity, related to the rebirth of the Croatian national idea, called the Illyrian movement.Ivo Banac, The National Question in Yugoslavia: Origins, History, Politics, Cornell University Press, 1988, , pp. 73-74. It is Vitezoviƒá's best known historiographical work, which had an immense influence on the later Illyrian movement. Background Following the 1699 treaty of Karlowitz, a commission was set up led by Luigi Ferdinando Marsili meant to establish the borders between the Ottoman Empire and the territories of the Habsburg Monarchy. Pavao Ritter Vitezoviƒá became part of this commission in various roles to fulfill, which subsequently was the main cause and inspiration for writing this work.O≈æivljena Hrvatska Pavla Rittera Vitezoviƒáa, Zrinka Perkoviƒá Its precursor was a memorandum Vitezoviƒá presented to Marsili, as a protest to this treaty.The Redivived Croatia of Pavao Ritter Vitezoviƒá, Ivo Banac, Harvard Ukrainian Studies, Vol. 10, No. 3/4, Concepts of Nationhood in Early Modern Eastern Europe (December 1986), pp. 492-507Whose Love of Which Country?: Composite States, National Histories and Patriotic Discourses in Early Modern East Central Europe, Sandor Bene, pp. 367 =Publication history= The work was published by Vitezoviƒá in Zagreb, and there are currently only three copies preserved. One originated from the inheritance of Marsili at Bologna,THE COPY OF VITEZOVIƒÜS WORK REVIVED CROATIA FROM THE INHERITANCE OF COUNT L. F. MARSIGLIO, Zrink Bla≈æeviƒá others are kept in the Croatian State Archives. Description The work is actually a brochure numbering only 32 pages. It was intended as a draft for a much larger work which the author never managed to realize. It begins with a dedication to Emperor Leopold, naming him, among other, \\"king of all Croatia\\", as a reflection of political ambitions outlined in this book. This is followed by an introductory in verse Monitio ad Prodromum, where goals and ideas of the work are laid out. In the same poem, consisting of 9 couplets, he encourages the reader to send him more material such as sources and coats of arms. The whole introductory part is meticulously structured, thoroughly stylized (demonstrating Vitezoviƒá abilities as a printer), and using rhetorical devices such as puns, litotes, homeoteleuton, etc. In Croatia Rediviva, Vitezoviƒá sets out to first establish the origin of the Croat name (ethonogenesis), and then the extent of boundaries of Croatia, trying to reconcile contradictions in various sources ranging from chronicles such as Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja to historians Mavro Orbini and Johannes Lucius. Using White Croatia, White Croats and the Legend of Lech, Czech and Rus as basis, Vitezoviƒá declared all Western and Eastern Slavs as Croats. The second part is a polemic against those who view Croats as different to Slavs and Illyrians. He maintains Slavs and Croats are synonyms, holding the term \\"Illyrian\\" as merely a Greek and Latin name for Slavs. By denouncing Lucius as a Venetian apologist, he negates Venetian claim to Dalmatia. Finishing the book with the newly attained belief that all Slavs held the Croat name, he views all the Slavic lands as being divided in two main parts: Northern Croatia (Croatia Septemtrionalis, which included Hungary) and Southern Croatia (Croatia Meridionalis), the latter being further divided into Red Croatia and White Croatia. White Croatia he divided in four regions: *Maritime Croatia *Mediterranean Croatia *Mesopotamian Croatia *Alpine Croatia These newly coined terms corresponded to actual region of Dalmatia, Slavonia, Noricum, whereas Red Croatia consisted of Serbia, Macedonia, Bulgaria and Odryssia. Interpretations and influence According to historian Ivo Banac, Vitezoviƒá treated his \\"pan-Croatianism\\" both as a historical construct and as a political programme, originating as an outrage against the centuries long fragmentation of Croatian lands and the whole Slavic south. The work is also a polemic against Venetian territorial pretensions and in favor of legitimising Habsburg expansionism. However, Vitezoviƒá did not treat his Greater Croatia as a unified whole, acknowledging different customs, names and emblems of territories included. Although, he maintained these were not important for the common nationhood and lineage of the Croats. Banac also argued against treating this work as a case of national exclusivism, stating that this work also influenced the national movement of the Serbs and Bulgarians. Ferdo ≈†i≈°iƒá once regarded the work as a \\"Bible of Croat national policy in the 19th century\\", inspiring such individuals as Ljudevit Gaj, Eugen Kvaternik and Ante Starƒçeviƒá.≈†i≈°iƒá, Hrvatska Historiografija pp. 46 Vitezoviƒá anticipated the Romanticist movement with his treatment of \\"nationhood\\".Croatia through history: the making of a European state, Branka Maga≈°, Saqi, 2007 \\"but the moment produced a vision of a reborn Croatia that would never again be lost. One of its early manifestations was the publication in 1700 of Croatia Rediviva by Pavao Ritter Vitezovic\\" He speculated on the origin of the Croats, which is one of the main elements of national thought, ultimately becoming a precursor to modern ideologue.Nationalism as Ideology: Was Paul Ritter Vitezoviƒá a National Thinker or an Ideologist?, Martina Topiƒá He manipulated and misrepresented sources, perhaps deliberately, in order to support his own political intention in the book. Zrinka Perkoviƒá regards the work as exceptionally important, despite its short length and span. She describes the work as a Utopian vision of a typical absolutist state.

They were also described as having ‚Äúcourteous ways and kindly manners‚Äù' and ‚Äúlow, soft speech.‚Äù The ‚Äúquartette of favorites of the gods‚Äù were adept in the science of healing. They effected many cures by the ‚Äúlaying on of hands,‚Äù and became famous across O'ahu. When it came time for the healers to depart, there was a desire to construct a ‚Äúmost permanent reminder‚Äù so that ‚Äúthose who might come after could see the appreciation of those who had been succored and relieved of pain and suffering by their ministrations during their sojourn among them.\\" The four mahu \\"gave their decision to the people as a voice from the gods.\\" On the night of Kane, the people gathered in the vicinity of a famous ‚Äúbell rock‚Äù in Kaimuki and selected four giant boulders which were moved to Waikiki. Two were placed in the ground near their living place and two in the sea at their bathing place. Kapaemahu began a series of ceremonies and chants to embed the healers' powers within the stones, burying idols indicating the dual male and female spirit of the healers under each one. The legend also states that ‚Äúsacrifice was offered of a lovely, virtuous chiefess,‚Äù and that the ‚Äúincantations, prayers and fasting lasted one full moon.‚Äù Once their spiritual powers had been transferred to the stones, the four mahu vanished, and were never seen again.  History of the stones  = Traditional times = The stones are thought to have remained at Waikiki from before the time of Kakuhihewa, the 16thcentury Alii Aimoku of Oahu, to the modern era, two on the stretch of beach now known as Kahaloa, and two in the ocean at the surf spot called Kapuni. There they served as both a sacred site for healing and a marker for a dangerous section of the outer reef known as the ‚ÄúCave of the Shark God.‚ÄùGutmanis, June. 1984. Pohaku, Hawaiian Stones: Brigham Young University Press. = 1905‚Äì1941 = The first printed mention of the stones occurred in The Pacific Commercial Advertiser in 1905 ‚ÄúSacrificial Stones Idols and Skeleton - Relics of a Barbarian Past Uncovered.‚Äù The Pacific Commercial Advertiser, Feb 23, 1905,p 1.. The article described how Archibold Scott Cleghorn, a Scottish-born businessman who married Princess Likelike and fathered Princess Ka ªiulani, had for two decades noticed a stone outcropping on their beach property that he thought might have religious significance. The stone was located near Likelike's customary bathing spot, and she and her daughter placed seaweed lei on it before bathing in the ocean. While erecting a beach house on the property, Cleghorn had the approximately eight ton boulder excavated and placed on the surface. It was judged to be of a different class than typically found on or near the beach, more likely from the hills of Kaimuki behind Kapiolani park. Another large stone, estimated to weigh 10 tons, was discovered in an adjacent lot, followed by two more, all in a straight line. The four large boulders were unearthed and placed together in the front yard of Cleghorn's beach property. According to the article, during the excavation the remains of a human skeleton with intact jawbone were discovered under the ten ton rock. Also discovered were the remnants of four or five stone idols, two of which were cemented on top of the rocks. When Cleghorn passed away in 1910, his will stipulated that ‚Äúthe historical stones now upon the premises last above mentioned shall not be defaced or removed from said premises.‚ÄùGrant, Glen. 1996. Waikiki Yesteryear. Mutual Pub Co. Nevertheless, in 1941, the Honolulu Star Bulletin reported that the stones were to be removed to make way for an air conditioned bowling alley called Waikiki Bowls.‚ÄúWizard Stones to Go So Waikiki May Bowl.‚Äù Honolulu Star Bulletin, 1941, Jun 6, p 1. The proposed removal of the stones was protested by Native Hawaiians, who believed that \\"these stones should be preserved for their traditional value and in order to retain our individuality as a community.‚Äù‚ÄúHawaiian Club Hits Removal of Wizard Stones.‚Äù Honolulu Star Bulletin, 1941, Jun 7, p 1.. The developer of the bowling alley promised to place the stones in a prominent spot, thereby gaining approval from the planning commission, but in fact the stones were buried in the foundation of the new building, where they remained for two decades.Feeser, Andrea and Gaye Chan. 2006. Waikiki: A History of Forgetting and Remembering. University of Hawaii Press. = Late 20th Century = The City and County of Honolulu condemned the Cleghorn property for a public beach in 1958, and the stones were re-identified four years later when the bowling alley was demolished and the beach area restored. In recognition of their historical significance, the stones were embedded in the sand at the new Kuhio Beach Park and marked by a plaque titled ‚ÄúWizard Stones of Kapaemahu.‚Äù‚ÄúLegendary ‚ÄòWizard Stones‚Äô Are Restored at Waikiki.‚Äù Honolulu Advertiser, 1963, Sep 8, p 1.

The committee ªs vision for the healing stones emerged from the goals of protecting, revitalizing and beautifying the stones as a wahi pana, or sacred site, and included ceremonies and rituals led by Papa Auwae at auspicious times. The resulting placement and arrangement of the stones was enhanced with an altar and platform by artist and traditional sculptor Billy Fields as a sculptural public art installation titled The Stones of Life.  Interpretations and Film  The literal interpretation of Kapaemahu is ‚Äúa row of mahu:‚Äù Ka is the definite singular article; pae is a row, cluster or group; and mahu is a third gender category referring to individuals with a mixture of male and female attributesPukui, Mary Kawena, Samuel H Elbert and Esther T Mookini. 1974. Place Names of Hawaii. University of Hawai'i Press. A possible secondary translation is ‚Äúthe landing of mahu,‚Äù interpreting pae as to land, disembark or come ashore. The original name used for the stones of Kapaemahu was ‚ÄúWizard Stones.‚Äù While this term seems disrespectful by current standards, concurrent Hawaiian language newspaper descriptions used the more appropriate description ‚Äúkahuna,‚Äùwhich encompasses priests and experts in any area including healing‚ÄúKa Buke Almanaka a Thrum.‚Äù Ka Nupepa Kuokoa, 1907, Jan 4, p. 1. The name \\"NƒÅ P≈çhaku Ola O Kapaemahu A Me Kapuni\\" translates as ‚ÄúThe Stones of Life of Kapaemahu and Kapuni.\\" This title refers to the stones as a site of healing, rather than as a memorial to the four visitors, and it de-emphasizes the connection of the site to mahu by tacking on the name Kapuni at the end. The role of gender in the legend of Kapaemahu has been the subject of several interpretations and revisions. The mahu status of the healers was prominent in the original publication and 1941 newspaper description of the legend. However, when the stones were first recovered on Kuhio Beach in 1963, during a period of legal discrimination against mahu, the accompanying historical plaque and newspaper article made no mention of the healers' gender. A 1980 newspaper article cited Leatrice Ballesteros, a Filipino fortune teller and ‚ÄúMadame Pele devotee‚Äù, describing the stones as representing the spirits of two males and two females. Although this speculation has no basis in Hawaiian history or culture, it was nevertheless widely repeated in subsequent accounts of the stones. During the 1997 restoration, Hawaiian tourism advocate George Kanahele asserted that ‚Äúthe name Kapaemahu reflects that, 'Kapae' means 'to set aside'; mahu means 'homosexual desire\\",‚ÄúLog Entry Yields Clues on Stones.‚Äù Honolulu Advertiser, 1997, Apr 20, p 11. but this interpretation of Kapaemahu as ‚Äúthe non-homosexual stones‚Äù is inconsistent with normal Hawaiian usage and grammar and is not accepted by native speakers or Hawaiian scholars.Pukui, Mary Kawena and Samuel H. Elbert.1986. Hawaiian Dictionary. University of Hawaii Press In an effort to restore the stones of Kapaemahu as a permanent reminder of this aspect of Hawaiian history, the original manuscript of the moolelo has been used as the basis for an animated film that depicts the contributions of the four mahu to healing and the subsequent suppression of their story. The animation, titled Kapaemahu, is narrated in the Niihau dialect, which is the only form of Hawaiian that has been continuously spoken and is the closest to the language that would have been spoken by the healers, to give viewers an opportunity to hear the moolelo as it might have been originally shared. The film premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival, where it was recognized by a special jury mention, and won the Grand Jury Prize at the Oscar-qualifying Animayo International Animation Film Festival.

Operational history In a review Michael McGoldrick wrote, \\"despite its placid cruising exterior, the Niagara 31 offers some very good performance. This confirmed by its PHRF rating of 156, compared, for example, to the Aloha 32's rating of 171 (faster boats have lower PHRF numbers). The only drawback with the Niagara 31 is that it is a little more tender than most cruising boats in its size range.\\" Reviewer Richard Sherwood wrote of the design, \\"Beam is moderate and the hull is V-form. Design is modern, with a fin keel and semibalanced rudder. While this is a tall rig, the foretriangle is not excessively large, and handling of foresails is reduced.\\" A review in Practical Sailor noted, \\"when it comes to performance, the 31 excels. Thanks to its big sloop rig with 492 square feet of sail, it does nicely in light airs. This also means reefing is required earlier‚Äîmost owners say at about 15 knots. And nearly all said so.

It shows evidence of frequent occupation by Neanderthals. Location and description The site is on the left bank of a small ravine, the Barranco de Ahillas; it is a rock shelter between 2 and 9 meters deep, and 38 meters long, facing the northwest. Because of the lack of direct sunshine and its exposure, the site was occupied only from June to October, according to Phytoliths and other evidence, including the reuse and resharpening of stone tools. The area is bordered by two rivers, the Rio Tuejar and the Turia, and two mountain formations, the Sierra de Javalambre (part of the Sistema Ib√©rico) and the Serra d‚ÄôUtiel. The site's location, at the entrance of a valley with a dead end, allowed for hunting and trapping large herbivores. The river that (intermittently) runs through the canyon opens onto a plain, and thus the site accessed three different biotopes: the riverside, the mountains, and a plain, so many different kinds of prey could be hunted. The deposit is around 3 meters thick, and is divided into eight units by archaeologists. The upper layer is disturbed by recent use of the shelter as a sheep pen. There is evidence of human occupation in all but one layer (number 6). Samples of charcoal were dated by way of accelerator mass spectrometry; one sample in level 3 was 40,500 year old, and two samples in level 4 were 43,930 and 50,800 years old. Human occupation and remains Flint tools found at the site give evidence of extensive traffic of Neanderthal populations in the area. Occupations in level 4 were frequent and intense, but short term. While much of the flint was procured locally (Dome√±o), some of it came from over 100 kilometers away; knapping was done also by way of the Levallois technique. Remains of most animals of all four major families (Equidae, Deer, Caprinae, Leporidae) were found, including red deer, ibex, and horse, besides small birds and tortoise. Meat and marrow were eaten.

He was the first Russian captain to enter the waters of the eastern Aleutian Islands, and was the European discoverer of Kodiak Island and several other Alaskan islands. Early voyages Glotov's first recorded voyage was in 1746 aboard the vessel Ioann (\\"John\\"), belonging to the merchant Fyodor Kholodilov of Totma. This ship sailed from the Kamchatka Peninsula, hunting for sea otters and seals, and wintered on Bering Island. In the following spring, the Ioann went in search of the middle Aleutian Islands (the chain had fairly recently come to the awareness of the Russians), but were unsuccessful. In 1758‚Äì1762, Glotov and Cossacks of the Nizhny Kamchatsky ostrog explored aboard the vessel Saint Julian. Aboard were the Cossack Ponomarev and the merchant Peter Shishkin. This expedition opened up the Aleutian Islands to the Russian fur trade. The Saint Julian set off from the mouth of the Kamchatka River on September 2, 1758 (September 15 New Style). After nine days Glotov arrived at the Komandorski Islands. After spending the winter on Medny Island, Glotov's expedition sailed east and discovered Umnak Island in the Aleutians, landing there on September 1, 1759. Aleuts immediately attacked his expedition, wounding Glotov and killing two of his men, but Glotov exercised restraint at this time. Glotov and his men spent three winters at Umnak, amassing over a thousand pelts of fox fur (Glotov was the first to bring large amounts of fox fur back to Russia from Alaska) as well as many sea otter skins. During this time (1759‚Äì1762), Glotov and his men discovered several islands of the Aleutian chain, including Unimak and Unalaska. The Saint Julian returned to Kamchatka on August 31, 1762 (September 13 New Style). In his report, Glotov lists 29 islands and describes their wildlife. 1762 expedition, and war against the Aleuts On October 1, 1762 (October 14 New Style), Glotov embarked on another expedition from the coast of Kamchatka to the Aleutian Islands and the northwestern coast of North America, on the vessel Adrian and Natalia, belonging to the merchant Lapin. Glotov had a crew of 38 Russians and eight Kamchadals (Kamchatka natives). Glotov and his men again wintered on Medny Island, setting forth from there on July 26, 1763 (August 8 New Style). Glotov discovered several more islands, including Kodiak Island (the 80th largest island in the world, slightly larger than Cyprus, Puerto Rico, or Corsica). During this expedition, Glotov and his men suppressed a revolt of the Aleut natives of the Fox Islands. The Aleuts were unhappy with the depredations of Promyshlenniks (Russian fur workers) who followed on the heels of the explorers, and who were brutal and avaricious and pursued a policy of forcing natives to work and pay the Yasak (tax paid in furs) by taking their families hostage. The Aleuts had consequently revolted against the Russian occupation, killing many Russians and driving most of the rest from the islands, and destroying most of the Russian vessels in the area. Glotov and his men destroyed all the Aleut villages on the southern part of Umnak, and with the assistance of other forces the revolt was ended, with several hundred Aleuts being killed directly and many more perishing from related causes (wounds, hunger, cold and disease). This effectively ended Aleutian independence. Ethnographer and missionary I. E. Veniaminov, relying on the accounts of eyewitnesses of these events, wrote of Glotov: \\"He, under the pretext of revenge for the death of his compatriots, as well as for rebellion itself, destroyed almost all the villages that were on the southern side of Umnak, and the inhabitants of the islands of Samalga and the Islands of Four Mountains.\\" In the course if this expedition, Glotov collected valuable ethnographic information about the Aleuts, in addition to killing them. Final voyage and death In October of 1768, Glotov was part of an expedition lead by Krenitsyn and Levashov, which explored of the northern coast of the Alaska Peninsula and discovered Port Moller Bay. Glotov died of scurvy in the spring of 1769, while wintering on Unimak Island. A mountain on Kodiak Island is named for Glotov, as is a street in the village of Yarensk. In 1992, archaeologists working for the Aleut located the site where Glotov was attacked by armed Unangan.

Background Mitole is a bay horse who was bred in Kentucky by Edward Cox. His sire Eskendereya won the Wood Memorial Stakes and was a favorite for the 2010 Kentucky Derby before being scratched due to injury. Eskendereya began his stud career in Kentucky but was exported to Japan in 2015. His leading runners include Metropolitan Handicap winner Mor Spirit. Mitole's dam, Indian Miss by Indian Charlie, never won during a short racing career. Mitole was sold for $20,000 at the 2016 Keeneland Yearling Sales. He was then resold for $140,000 as a two-year-old- in-training at the 2017 Ocala Breeders' Sale. His new owners, William and Corinne Heiligbrodt, placed him with Hall of Fame trainer Steve Asmussen. Racing career Mitole's first race, and only start as a two-year-old, was on November 25, 2017 at the Fair Grounds in New Orleans, where he finished third. He started his three-year-old campaign on January 13, 2018 in a maiden special weight race at Oaklawn Park, finishing second. On February 3, he entered another maiden race at Oaklawn, in which he led from the start and opened up in the stretch to win by 10 lengths. He earned a strong Beyer Speed Figure of 96 in the race, but Asmussen decided to keep the colt to sprint distances rather than test him on the Triple Crown trail. Mitole made his stakes race debut in the listed Gazebo Stakes at Oaklawn on March 24, finishing second. He then won his next three starts, an allowance race on March 17, the Bachelor Stakes on April 12 (both at Oaklawn) and the Chick Lang Stakes on May 19 at Pimlico Race Course, all of them by wide margins in front- running fashion. In the Bachelor, he earned a Beyer Speed Figure of 107. \\"He's run some awfully big numbers,\\" said William Heiligbrodt. \\"I've had a lot of horses, and I haven't had one this fast.\\" Mitole was next scheduled to race in the Woody Stephens Stakes but was sidelined by a splint bone injury. He missed the rest of his three-year-old campaign as a result. Mitole returned to racing on March 2, 2019 with another win at Oaklawn Park as the 2-5 favorite in a six-furlong allowance race. He then made his first start in a graded stakes race at the Count Fleet Sprint Handicap on April 13. His main rival was veteran sprinter Whitmore, who had won the previous two runnings of the race. Over sloppy going, Mitole went to the early lead, followed closely by Whitmore. The two dueled for the first half mile, with Whitmore briefly getting a head in front turn. Mitole responded to the challenge by drawing clear in the stretch to win by lengths. \\"To win his first graded stakes is special,\\" said Asmussen. \\"He's an elite caliber horse. He handles the wet track extremely well.\\" Mitole made his first start at the Grade I level in the Churchill Downs Stakes on May 4 over a distance of seven furlongs. He went off as the 2-1 favorite in a field of 11 that included stakes winners Whitmore, Promised Fulfilled and Bobby's Wicked One. In a change of tactics, Mitole rated in third behind Promises Fulfilled and Bobby's Wicked One, who completed the first half mile in a fast :44.71 seconds. Mitole started his move on the far turn then continued to draw away down the stretch for a -length win. Mitole then entered the prestigious Metropolitan Handicap (also known as the Met Mile) on June 8 at Belmont Park. The field included both sprinters like Mitole and Firenze Fire, hoping to stretch their speed out over the extra distance, and classic distance horses McKinzie and Thunder Snow, who were cutting back in distance after winning the Santa Anita Handicap and Dubai World Cup respectively. Mitole pressed the early pace set by Coal Front, moved to the lead at the head of the stretch and held off a late run from McKinzie to win by three-quarters of a length. \\"This is really a special horse,\\" said jockey Ricardo Santana Jr. \\"He can come [from the] back, he can go in front, you can put him between horses and he always keeps trying his best.\\" Mitole's seven-race winning streak was broken in the six furlong Alfred G. Vanderbilt Handicap on July 27 at Saratoga Race Course, when he finished third to Imperial Hint. He rebounded in the Forego Stakes on August 24, in which he vied for the early lead with Promises Fulfilled then pulled away in the stretch to win by three lengths. He completed the seven furlongs in a stakes record time of 1:20.80. \\"I think the circumstances for the Vanderbilt just didn't suit him ‚Äì coming off a huge run in the Met Mile and cutting back to three-quarters,\\" said Asmussen. \\"But he came out of the race in good shape, trained beautifully for this, and the results speak for themselves.\\" On August 25, Spendthrift Farm announced that it had acquired the breeding rights to Mitole. Ned Toffey, the general manager of Spendthrift, commented that the colt's brilliance was best illustrated by his win in the Metropolitan Handicap. \\"That was both the field of the year and race of the year so far, and Mitole showed just how brilliantly fast and classy he is in that performance.\\" Mitole's win in the Metropolitan Handicap had earned him an all- expenses-paid berth in the $1 million Breeders Cup Mile but his connections instead decided to enter him in the $2 million Breeders' Cup Sprint, run in 2019 at Santa Anita Park over a distance of six furlongs on November 2. The field originally included Imperial Hint, who had beaten Mitole in the Vanderbilt at the same distance, but Imperial Hind developed a blister on his coronet band and had to be scratched. In his absence, Mitole's main rivals were expected to be Shancelot, who had won the Amsterdam Stakes by lengths, and Catalina Cruiser (Pat O'Brien Stakes). Shancelot went to the early lead, completing the first quarter-mile in :21.47. Mitole settled a few lengths behind while racing wide, then started to make up ground as they rounded the final turn. Shancelot still had a narrow lead in mid-stretch but Mitole drew away in the final furlong to win by lengths in a time of 1:09. Heiligbrodt commended Asmussen for keeping Mitole in top form throughout the year, while Asmussen gave credit to the horse. \\"Nothing but class, and the ability he has is just tremendous,\\" said Asmussen. \\"I don't know that people realize from where he was in the spring to stretching out to beating the field he did in the Met Mile, to retract from that and beat the best sprinters in the world... But it's a very difficult job, one that a horse of his elite abilities is capable of doing.\\" Mitole was named the American Champion Male Sprinter of 2019 at the 49th annual Eclipse Awards. Retirement Mitole was retired to stud at Spendthrift Farm after the Breeders' Cup. His stud fee for 2020 was set at $25,000.

Though she began her career as a teacher and librarian, Wood switched to fiber arts to allow her to express her creativity. She published Native American Fashion: Modern Adaptations of Traditional Designs, which for four decades was the only book focused on traditional native clothing and how it was modified in contemporary design. From 1990, Wood primarily became a quilter, displaying her works at numerous featured exhibitions throughout the United States, including such venues as the American Craft Museum in Manhattan; the Heard Museum of Phoenix, Arizona; the Riverside Metropolitan Museum of Riverside, California and the Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian of Santa Fe, New Mexico, among many others. Early life Margaret Wood was born in 1950 in Parker, Arizona to Helen Mae (n√©e Watchman) and Charlie Wood. Her mother was a Navajo and her father had Seminole heritage. Her mother was raised at Fort Defiance in the Navajo Nation, and became a teacher in Poston and later in Tuba City. Her father grew up in Oklahoma as part of the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma and was a carpenter. Wood was the couple's second child following Ronald Cully and preceding Charles, Jr. Wood attended public school in Tuba City and Flagstaff and learned to sew from her mother when she was about nine years old. After suffering a stroke brought about from surgery, Wood's mother died in 1964. Completing her secondary schooling, Wood attended Arizona State University on a full scholarship from the Navajo Nation. She graduated with a bachelor's degree in education in 1971. Career Wood began her career as a teacher immediately upon earning her degree, but after a year continued with graduate studies at the University of Denver. She earned a master's degree in library science with a thesis A Survey of Library Services Available to Navajo People on the Navajo Reservation in 1973 and that year began working as the librarian of the Navajo Community College in Tsaile, Arizona. She then worked Phoenix Public Library for two years, married Thomas Galbraith, an attorney, and began writing Native American Fashion: Modern Adaptations of Traditional Designs. At that time, the American Indian Movement which had been influenced by the Civil Rights Movement, had an impact on popular culture. Native women like Wood, realized that they could express their pride of identity through the fashion that they wore and simultaneously by designing fashion could act as role models for other indigenous women. As she was researching clothing in the Denver Art Museum for inclusion in her book, she compiled information on traditional garments and gave examples for how those could be refashioned as contemporary designs, using photographs of traditional dress and drawings illustrating the modifications. The book was organized into geographic regions and she included a broad sampling of styles, which included for example, blouses and skirts featuring Seminole patchwork and fringe and ribbonwork of the Plains Indians, camp dresses of the Western Apache, kilts of the Pueblo and Hopi, pant suits of the Navajo, skirts of the Iroquois, and a variety of garments from tribes in the Great Lakes and Pacific Coast regions. She also explored how contemporary fashion could be modified to reflect the current trend to celebrate Native pride. In 1978 after five years of working as a librarian, Wood decided to change direction and focus her attention on fiber arts and finding a publisher for her book. She decided to remain at home, when her son Charlie was born in 1979 and began sewing. When she won the Best Needlework Design for her quilted work featuring Seminole patchwork in a fashion show at the Heard Museum that year, she was discovered by Zia a local retail store in Phoenix, who began to carry her work. The book was finally published in 1981 and for over four decades was the only work to focus exclusively on contemporary Native American fashion. That same year, she launched Native American Fashions, Inc. and spent the next decade focused on fashion. She participated in over 40 fashion shows and exhibitions that highlighted her work, such as the fashion show hosted at the Santa Fe Indian Market (Santa Fe, New Mexico), the Annual Festival of Native American Arts (Sedona, Arizona), and shows at the Heard Museum (Phoenix) and the Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian (Santa Fe, New Mexico). In 1984, while attending the Annual Heard show, Wood was uninspired by the quilts entered and decided to try to design one. She entered her first attempt in the 1985 show, earning an honorable mention. She was not happy with the result and began studying the art of quiltmaking, including the fabrics to use and various techniques, like applique, mola and trapunto. Inspiration for her color palette came from the limited gold, hunter green, red, and turquoise colors of trade beads and her designs were often inspired by Native American artifacts. Until 1990, Wood considered herself to be a fashion designer who quilted, but that year, she began to focus on quilting, as it allowed her more freedom for creative expression. Wood works in series, designing four quilts or quilted wall- hangings to each group to represent the four directions. Her first designs were geometric patterns found of basketry, beadwork, and in Navajo weaving. She later expanded her work to include more personal stories, interpreting the difficulty experienced by Native Americans of having to live in two cultures and biographical works focused on her family members. The quilts she designed for her father and mother, featured maze designs and different iconography to represent significant moments in each of their histories as they journeyed through their lives. Some of her groups, like The Bag Series are more like fabric sculptures. This series focused on various types of containers used by Native Americans and featured bags of varying sizes. Woods work has been widely exhibited in various museums. She has been an invited participant to Expressions of Spirit: Contemporary American Indian Art at the Wheelwright (1995); Native American Quilts from the Southwest: Tradition, Creativity, and Inspiration at the Institute of American Indian Arts (1998‚Äì1999); Head, Heart and Hands: Native American Craft Traditions in a Contemporary World at the Kentucky Museum of Art and Craft of Louisville and the Museum of Art in DeLand, Florida (1998); Changing Hands: Art without Reservation at the American Craft Museum in Manhattan (2002) and the New Mexico Museum of Art in Santa Fe (2003); Native Quilters of the Southwest at the Navajo Nation Museum (2005); and Quilt Stories at the Riverside Metropolitan Museum of Riverside, California (2008‚Äì2009), among many others.

She was sunk in action, off German-occupied Guernsey, on 23 October 1943. Design Limbourne was one of seven Type III Hunt-class destroyers ordered for the Royal Navy on 4 July 1940, as part of the 1940 War Emergency Programme. The Hunt class was meant to fill the Royal Navy's need for a large number of small destroyer-type vessels capable of both convoy escort and operations with the fleet. The Type III Hunts differed from the previous Type II ships in replacing a twin 4-inch gun mount by two torpedo tubes to improve their ability to operate as destroyers. The Type III Hunts were long between perpendiculars and overall, with a beam was and draught . Displacement was standard and under full load. Two Admiralty boilers raising steam at and fed Parsons single-reduction geared steam turbines that drove two propeller shafts, generating at 380 rpm.

Two torpedo tubes were fitted in a single twin mount, while two depth charge chutes, four depth charge throwers and 70 depth charges comprised the ship's anti-submarine armament. Type 291 and Type 285 radars were fitted, as was Type 128 sonar. Construction and service Limbourne was laid down at Alexander Stephen and Sons' shipyard at Linthouse, Glasgow on 8 April 1941. She was launched on 12 May 1942, and was completed on 24 October 1942. After commissioning, Limbourne spent November in sea trials and work up with the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow, interrupting work up to escort the battleship out to Gibraltar and the aircraft carrier and battleship back to the UK from the Mediterranean Sea following the Anglo- American landings in North Africa. After completing workup, she joined the 15th Destroyer Flotilla based at Devonport. In January and February 1943 Limbourne escorted convoys between the UK and Gibraltar, while in March, the ship was under repair at Portsmouth, with a propeller being replaced. Following the completion of these repairs, Limbourne was deployed on escort and anti-submarine patrol duties in the Western Approaches and the Bay of Biscay, together with operations against German convoys in the English Channel. On the night of 3/4 October 1943, Limbourne, together with , and the destroyers and , was on patrol off the coast of Brittany when they encountered five German torpedo boats (, , , and ).

It is located within North Cascades National Park, between Pyramid Peak and Paul Bunyans Stump, which is the nearest higher peak. It rises steeply from Diablo Lake, one of the reservoirs on the Skagit River. It is part of a group of peaks that form the northern end of a chain running south through climbing destinations such as Colonial Peak and Snowfield Peak. Like many North Cascade peaks, Pinnacle Peak is more notable for its large, steep rise above local terrain than for its absolute elevation. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into Diablo Lake and Skagit River. The approach is via the Pyramid Lake Trail, starting near Diablo Dam on the North Cascades Highway. From the lake, there is route-finding up Pyramid Arm to Colonial Glacier. Climate Pinnacle Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology Diablo The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

It first aired in Canada on Space and the United States on BBC America on 26 April 2014. The episode was written by Karen Walton and Graeme Manson, and directed by John Fawcett. Plot Kira calls Sarah, and Art traces it to a motel. Sarah gets kidnapped, while Art has a run-in with Daniel that later results in his suspension. Sarah is taken to Mrs. S, who reveals she ran away with Kira and made it look like a kidnapping. They go to a country house owned by two compatriots. Later that night, Kira admits she no longer trusts Mrs. S, so she and Sarah attempt to escape. Mrs. S learns that her compatriots plan to sell Kira to the Proletheans; she kills the two to allow Kira and Sarah to escape. Meanwhile, during Aynsley's funeral, Alison begins to suspect that Donnie was her monitor all along, so she and Felix set a trap for him that confirms her suspicions. Alison returns to drinking from the guilt of Aynsley's death. Cosima and Delphine set up a new lab at the Dyad institute to learn more about the former's condition. Art's partner Angela Deangelis learns of Helena's existence, but when she visits the hospital, Mark has taken Helena away to a ranch owned by Henrik Johanssen, the Prolethean leader who plans to use Helena to create a baby. Henrik has Tomas killed for objecting to his plan. Production \\"Governed by Sound Reason and True Religion\\" was shot in August‚ÄìSeptember 2013 in conjunction with the first episode of the second season, \\"Nature Under Constraint and Vexed\\", like the first two episodes of season 1 which were filmed together. Scenes at the Birdwatchers' hideout were filmed in an uninhabited house located near the Toronto Zoo. The set for Cosima's laboratory was built on a soundstage, but its design was partly based on the actual architecture of the building used to film exterior shots of the DYAD facilities. In the episode, Sarah and Helena are revealed to be mirror-image twins‚Äîthat is, identical twins in which one twin's entire anatomy is reversed, including their internal organs, so that each twin appears to be a \\"mirror image\\" of the other. Manson discovered the phenomenon while researching for the first season and decided to incorporate it into the plot to \\"make the science realistic in surprising ways\\". Fawcett said that the writers decided that Alison should learn that Donnie is her monitor‚Äîa fact revealed to the audience at the climax of the first season‚Äîin this episode since they intended \\"to reveal the mystery through the eyes of the character rather than let the audience in on things that the characters don't know\\". They thought that to prolong Alison's ignorance of the fact would make her character \\"look dumb\\". The episode's title is taken from a quote from Francis Bacon's philosophical work Novum Organum: \\"Only let the human race recover that right over nature which belongs to it by divine bequest; the exercise thereof will be governed by sound reason and true religion.\\" Reception \\"Governed by Sound Reason and True Religion\\" was aired in the United States on 26 April 2014 on BBC America. It was watched by 718,000 viewers, with a Nielsen rating of 0.29 in the demographic of adults aged 18‚Äì49. Mark Rozeman wrote for Paste that the episode's events \\"certainly highlight just how quickly the show burns through plot points\\". He praised Maslany and the series' writers for the dark humour of Alison's storyline and for \\"gleefully eschew[ing]\\" the conventions of traditional television. Entertainment Weekly Darren Franich enjoyed the episode's exploration of the conflicting philosophies of the Dyad corporation and the Prolethean cult. He thought that Helena's survival of a gunshot to the chest was an \\"extraordinarily unlikely event\\" but conceded that in science fiction \\"we oughtn't pick and choose which beliefs we're suspending\\". Eric Goldman of IGN praised Peter Outerbridge's performance as Henrik and the development of Mrs. S's character. Slant Magazine Matt Brennan opined that the episode \\"finds Orphan Black in peak form, dispensing with niceties in favor of taut, economical sequences that push the narrative forward along these lines.\\" He found the different storylines to form a cohesive whole but also individually satisfying; he gave particular praise to Alison's comedic subplot. Caroline Framke gave \\"Governed By Sound Reason and True Religion\\" a B+ grade for The A.V. Club, while Danielle Henderson rated it 3 out of 5 stars for Vulture.

Yooreey Mikhaylovich Kasyan; –Æ—Ä–∏–π –ú–∏—Ö–∞–π–ª–æ–≤–∏—á –ö–∞—Å—å—è–Ω; born May 6, 1961 in Snjatin) is a Ukrainian speleologist, most known for his work in cave exploration, especially as the Call of the Abyss research project coordinator. He was heading the speleological expeditions to caves of the Arabika massif in Abkhazia and, with Aleksandr Klimƒçuk, to Aladaglar massif in Turkey. Some of the world's deepest caves were explored, including the first cave, deeper than 2,000 m, the Krubera-Voronja Cave.  Early life, Education and Career  He was born in Snjatin, a small town in Western Ukraine, in the Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast (Province), to the north of Moldova. His father Mihail Jurjeviƒç Kasjan was chairman of the District Council of the Sports Society \\"Grain Ear\\", which promoted athletic development in the countryside, and his mother Nelja Dmitrievna was a statistician in the accounting department of the district party committee. After high school in Snjatin where he also pursued swimming and freestyle wrestling he graduated (1984) in geology at the Ivano- Frankivsk National Technical University of Oil and Gas in the province capital Ivano-Frankivsk. After graduation he moved to Poltava for a job in the regional branch of the All-Union Research and Design Institute for Explosive Geophysical Survey Methods. Kasjan continued as instructor at the Poltava regional center of education in tourism and local history and from there moved on to a career in industrial rope access. Kasjan at the entrance of the Krubera-Voronja cave in 2016  Speleology  In the autumn of 1978, at the beginning of geology study in Ivano-Frankivsk, there were 3 available extra- curricular courses: in tourism, rock climbing and speleology. From the latter two Kasjan chose speleology as the closest to geology and joined the Ivano- Frankivsk speleo club –ü—Ä–æ—Ç–µ–π [Proteus]. He stayed till 1984, since 1981 he was its chairman. In 1984 he founded the Poltava speleoclub \\"Poltava-speleo\\", which he led until 2003. In 2004 he joined the Kiev speleoclub; for several years he was the head of its speleo school, he is a longtime member of the club board. In 1992 Kasjan was one of the founding members of the Ukrainian Speleological Association (UkrSA). As of April 2019 he is the vice-president of the UkrSA; he served as president in the years 1998 - 2001 and 2006 - 2007. Since 2003 he is an honorary member of the UkrSA, in 1996 and 2012 Kasjan was the recipient of the UkrSa Diploma for Outstanding Achievements. He is the coordinator of the Training and Methodological Commission of the UkrSA, MIPKAR and ‚ÄúCall of the Abyss‚Äù projects, head of the UkrSA Cave Rescue Team. From 1978 to 1998 Kasjan's caving activity was mostly devoted to caves of Western Ukraine and the Crimea, such as Gvozdetsky abyss, Liu-Khosar shaft, Shaft of the lost ones and discovery and mapping of over 1,5 km long Poltavskiy branch of the labyrinthine Mlinki cave. He initiated a program of marking and revising the caves of the Karabi plateau in the Crimea (1998). From 1998 Kasjan participated in several international caving expeditions, to Arabika massif in Abkhazia (as a leader since 1999), to Skalarjevo brezno cave on Mt. Kanin in Slovenia and Aladaglar mountain range in Turkey as the leader of operations in the cave. Cavers are known for their superstition, and Kasjan was never tempted to estimate expedition potential in advance: Top three Ortobalagan caves, connected to Kasjan's work in the past 20 years  Arabika Caves  Kasjan's most important achievements are connected to exploration of a cave system above the eastern coast of the Black sea, in the Ortobalagan valley in Abkhazia. He was leading the following expeditions, nearly always organized by the Ukrainian Speleological Association: * 2000 * August: the second team reached -1,200 m in Krubera-Voronja. * September: exploration continued to -1,410 m. * 2001 * December (2000) - January: - windows at - 1,350 meters led to a deeper passage at - 1,430 meters. In it a side passage at -1,420 m continued to -1,710 meters, world depth record, for the first time in a cave outside Western Europe. * August: explorations in the lower part (1,420 m -1,710 m); a siphon at -1,650 was dived. * 2004 October: siphon bypass produced a descent to -2,080 meters. Another world cave depth record and Kasjan was the first caver to set foot deeper than 2,000 m. * 2005 * February: Kvitoƒçka siphon in the Main branch of Krubera-Voronja cave was dived through and the depth of -1,980 m was reached. * October: 4 teams worked in the cave but had to stop because of flooding on October 17. * 2006 August: world cave depth record of 2,158 m was achieved by the diver Gennadij Samohin in the \\"Dva Kapitana\\" siphon. For the first time all the expedition garbage (excluding body waste) was brought back to surface. * 2007 August - September: G. Samohin moved the world cave depth record to -2,191 m in the same siphon. For the first time only electric illumination was used in the cave. * 2008 August: works continued in the main branch of the cave and in Nekujbi≈°evskaja branch, as well as in the cave –í–µ–Ω—Ç–∏–ª—è—Ç–æ—Ä [Ventilation Fan]. * 2009 August - September: two teams, the second headed by Aidas Gudaitis from Lithuania, worked in Krubera-Voronja, Kujbi≈°evskaja, Detskaja and Silver Prince caves. Temperature and pressure loggers were installed at the bottom of the cave. Radiation levels were measured in all the caves. All readings but one (in Kujbi≈°evskaja cave at -500m) were within normal limits. There were issues with body feces contaminated water which led to serious gastrointestinal problems of one caver. The decision was made to store, in the future, all body waste in special containers and bring it back to surface. * 2010 August - September: exploration continued in the Nekujbi≈°evskaja branch of the cave. It was prolonged by 600 m, 2 siphons were dived. * 2011 September: in Nekujbi≈°evskaja branch of Krubera-Voronja the siphon Koljuƒçka (Thorn) at 1,558 m was free dived after a drawdown, digging in a connection passage to Kujbi≈°evskaja cave was continued. Martel cave (entrance at 2,316 m a.s.l.) was deepened to 95 m, it ends in a narrow meander with strong air current. * 2012 July‚ÄìAugust: G. Samohin corrected the world cave depth record to -2,196 m in the \\"Dva Kapitana\\" siphon of Krubera-Voronja. Martel cave depth was moved to 135 m. * 2013 July‚ÄìAugust: cave fauna was collected in Krubera-Voronja. Gennadij Samohin caught a few crustaceans in the \\"Dva Kapitana\\" siphon, fish traps produced no results. Martel cave was slightly prolonged, strong roar of wind follows. Works began in Berƒçilskaja (pron. Berchilskaya) cave (2,430 m a.s.l., -500 m), a possible higher entrance to Krubera. * 2014 August: Amber siphon in Krubera-Voronja was dived through; the path to historical bottom at -340 m was cleared. Top tight passages in Berƒçilskaja were widened. An expedition of MSU Speleo Club connected Krubera-Voronja with Arbaika cave and the total depth reached 2,199 m. * 2015 August: narrows in Berƒçilskaja cave, at that time 500 m deep, were cleared till the depth of 400 m. * 2016 July‚ÄìAugust: at the historical bottom in Krubera-Voronja a series of shafts led back to the main branch of the cave. Berƒçilskaja - a new bottom was reached at -630 m. * 2017 August: In Krubera-Voronja 60 m of a large tunnel in the siphon at -1,650 m was dived. In Berƒçilskaja depth of -770 was reached and a better survey was made. The main direction of new parts is south, away from Krubera-Voronja. Connection will have to be searched elsewhere. * 2018 August: digging in Berƒçilskaja cave was conducted, in most lucrative places for connection with Krubera-Voronja, at -480 m and at -650 m (Old School hall). His right hand in most of these projects was Russian cave diver from Simferopol, Gennadij Samohin; as of July 2019 cavers from 20 countries have participated in the list (sorted in descending order by the number of expeditions - given after the country name if exceeding 1): Ukraine (21), Russia (14), Israel (8), United States (4), Bulgaria (3), Lithuania (3), Poland (2), Spain (2), United Kingdom (2), Belarus, Belgium, Britain, France, Iran, Ireland, Italy, Lebanon, Moldova and Turkey. Water is probably the most picturesque cave element: Ma≈°a Plotnikova in Krubera-Voronja cave, at -1,340 m, 2007, by J. Kasjan  Aladaglar Caves  Kasjan also made a major contribution to exploration of caves in the Aladaglar mountain ridge above the southern coast of Anatolia in Turkey, in the framework of the Call of the Abyss project. From 2002 to 2008 over 150 new caves were examined in the area, most notably Kuzgun cave, discovered in 2003, explored 400 m deep and in 2004 to its final (as of 2019) depth of 1400 m. In 2005, 2008 and 2013 three caves in the vicinity which could lead to greater depth were examined, 900 m deep side branch in Kuzgun was explored and engineering works at the cave bottom, which would stabilize loose collapse, were undertaken. In 2018 and 2019 Kasjan lead expeditions to new caves in the neighbouring area, also as part of the project.  Film, Photography, Journalism  Kasjan documented the underground explorations in which he participated in over 100 short films. His photographs, especially from the Krubera-Voronja cave were published in several national and international journals, books such as The Darkness Beckons, and other publications, including the official cave photo site of the Ukrainian Speleological Association. He was a juror in international cave photography competitions. Since 2004 Kasjan is the editor of the Ukrainian speleo journal –°–≤–µ—Ç [Light].

During much of his career LaBarge was in the employ of the American Fur Company, a giant in the fur trading business, before building his own steamboat, the Emilie, to become an independent riverman. During his career he exceeded several existing speed and distance records for steamboats on the Missouri River. Passengers aboard his vessels sometimes included notable people, including Abraham Lincoln. LaBarge routinely offered his steamboat services gratis to Jesuit missionaries throughout his career. LaBarge managed to avoid the first cholera epidemic in the United States, which at that time killed half the crew aboard the Yellowstone. After years of success in the shipping business, LaBarge, his brother, and other partners formed their own trading firm on the upper Missouri River. A steamboat captain for more than fifty years, LaBarge was considered the greatest steamboat man on the Missouri River, and was among the first steamboat pilots to navigate the uppermost Missouri River in the 1830s. His long career as a riverboat captain exceeded 50 years and spanned the entire era of active riverboat business on the Missouri River. Early life LaBarge in 1840 Joseph LaBarge was born on Sunday, October 1, 1815, in St. Louis, Missouri. His father was Joseph Marie LaBarge, Senior and his mother was Eulalie Hortiz LaBarge. He was the second of seven children, three boys and four girls, who all survived to adulthood.Chitteden, 1903, vol 1, p. 13 His father, at the age of 21, traveled from Quebec in a birch-bark canoe over lakes and rivers and settled in St. Louis at a time when the city was the center of the enormous fur trade. LaBarge Senior fought in the War of 1812, most notably at the Battle of Frenchtown where he lost two fingers during the battle.Chitteden, 1903, vol 1, p. 4 LaBarge Senior was a trapper who also worked as a guide and engaged in many trapping expeditions in the upper Missouri River. He was considered a riverman in his own right; subsequently all three of his sons, Joseph, John and Charles, aspired to the trade and became riverboat pilots.Missouri Historical Review, 1969, p. 449 Not long after Joseph was born his parents bought and moved to a farm in Baden, Missouri, six miles distant from St. Louis. The area was mostly unsettled at the time and Sac and Fox Indians roamed the area and were at times aggressive and hostile. The infant LaBarge and his mother were once accosted by Indians while she was working in the garden, with LaBarge's father fending them off by presenting gun in hand. As a young lad, LaBarge was said to have exceptional ability as a runner and swimmer, and excelled in the various games and sports of the day.Chittenden, 1903, Vol I, pp. 13‚Äì15 Joseph LaBarge's early education was somewhat limited given the basic and unrefined schools in St. Louis during his childhood days. He first attended classes at the residence of Jean Baptiste Trudeau, a noted and reputable teacher in St. Louis, where he studied the common branches in education, all in French. Knowing that their son needed to speak English fluently in order to make his way in America, his parents sent him to schools where instruction was given in English. To that end Joseph's next teacher was Salmon Giddings, the founder of the First Presbyterian Church in St. Louis, and after, to a more prestigious school taught by Elihu H. Shephard, considered an excellent teacher. His command of English would come slowly, but eventually he mastered the language. At age twelve Joseph attended Saint Mary's College in Perry County for three years. His parents had intended to educate their son for the priesthood, and Joseph's curriculum at Saint Mary's was selected for that purpose. However, the young LaBarge did not aspire to such vocation and began associating with young ladies to the extent where he was not allowed to finish school at Saint Mary's. At age fifteen he began working as a store clerk in a clothing store.Harper, Historical Society of Missouri, 2019, essayChittenden, 1903, Vol I, pp. 13‚Äì15, 18‚Äì19 Among the prominent events LaBarge witnessed in his childhood, was the celebrated visit to the United States by Lafayette in 1825, while he was in St. Louis. Lafayette was greeted by the Mayor and escorted by a company of cavalry on horseback, along with a company of uniformed boys, of whom the ten-year-old LaBarge was one. Lafayette shook hands and spoke inquisitively with each of the youths, which would prove to be an event LaBarge would reminisce about into his old age.Chittenden, 1903, vol 1, p. 15 LaBarge wore a full beard most of his adult life and in his later years was said to bear a striking resemblance to General Ulysses S. Grant.LaBarge, 2019, essay LaBarge married Pelagie Guerette on August 17, 1842, whom he knew since his childhood.Chitteden, 1903, vol 1, pp. 71‚Äì72 Pelagie was also born in St. Louis, on January 10, 1825. One of the first water-driven mills in St. Louis was built and operated by her father, a millwright and architect.LaBarge Family website They had seven children. LaBarge was a lifelong Catholic in religion, and in politics, a lifelong Democrat.Chittenden, 1903, vol I1, p. 444 Career on the river LaBarge's Masters License, for riverboats The demands of the fur trade were largely responsible for the advent of steamboat use on the Missouri River, and by 1830 the young LaBarge bore witness to the steamboats coming to and departing Saint Louis, which were employed in the service of this trade, their principal business in the mid-nineteenth century. Answering the high demand for furs in the East and in Europe, the American Fur Company, dominated the fur trade and made regular and frequent use of steamboats.Chittenden, 1903, vol I, p. 133 From 1831 to 1846 steamboat navigation on the upper Missouri River was confined almost entirely to riverboats owned by the American Fur Company. Among these vessels were the Yellowstone, and the Spread Eagle, both of which would eventually be piloted by LaBarge during the course of events.Martin (ed), 1906, pp. 282‚Äì283 Not content working as a shop clerk, the young LaBarge joined the crew of the steamboat Yellowstone, serving as a clerk, when the vessel was engaged in the sugar trade in the lower Mississippi River. In 1831 the Yellowstone made her first trip up the Missouri River, and was now in the employ of the American Fur Company. The Yellowstone was to proceed to the lower Mississippi to the bayou La Fourche. Since LaBarge spoke both English and French, his services were found useful. The following spring, LaBarge signed a three-year contract to serve as a clerk for the American Fur Company at a salary of $700. He returned to the Yellowstone and traveled up the Missouri River to Council Bluffs, Iowa, where he worked in the flourishing fur trade along the Missouri River.Missouri Historical Review, 1969, p. 450 LaBarge earned his Master's license for piloting riverboats at the age of 25.The National Mississippi River Museum =Journeys aboard the Yellowstone= Missouri River In 1833 LaBarge, aboard the steamship Yellowstone, left Saint Louis and was headed for Fort Pierre on the upper Missouri River. One of the passengers aboard was Prince Maximilian, a German explorer and naturalist. Returning to Saint Louis, another cargo was loaded, to be taken to Council Bluffs. During this voyage an epidemic of cholera broke out in the general area and claimed the lives of many of the crew members, forcing Captain Anson G. Bennett to stop at the mouth of the Kansas River until he could return to Saint Louis and get replacements for the crew. Before leaving, he assigned LaBarge the charge of the steamboat; this is when LaBarge, at age 18, began his fifty-year career as a riverman and steamboat pilot.Chappell, 1911, p. 76 While Bennett was away, the remainder of the crew died; LaBarge buried their bodies in a trench-grave alongside the Missouri.Jackson, 1985, p. 102 When news of the cholera outbreak aboard the Yellowstone spread, a pro tempore board of health from Jackson County ordered the boat to move on, threatening to burn the craft if it remained.Missouri Historical Review, 1969, p. 452 Now acting as both pilot and engineer, and realizing the danger, LaBarge took the boat up a short distance from the mouth of the Kansas on the west shore of the Missouri, where there were no inhabitants.Jackson, 1985, pp. 101‚Äì102Chappell, 1911, pp. 76‚Äì77 On Captain Bennett's return the boat proceeded on her voyage up the Missouri and arrived at the mouth of the Yellowstone on June 17, becoming the first steamboat to reach the mouth of the Yellowstone. The cargo still aboard was consigned to Cyprian Chouteau who owned a trading post ten miles up the Kansas River. Captain Bennett gave orders to LaBarge to turn over the cargo to the consignees before he left. LaBarge, accordingly, set off on foot to find the trading post and tell Chouteau to come and get his goods. About a mile from the trading post, which had quarantined itself from the cholera epidemic, LaBarge was intercepted by a man stationed there, wary of the outbreak, and watching for anyone coming from Missouri. LaBarge was not permitted to proceed and was threatened to be shot if he persisted. LaBarge agreed to remain where he was if the man would inform Chouteau of the purpose of his arrival.Chittenden, 1903, vol I, pp. 32‚Äì34 =Other ventures= During the summer of 1838, LaBarge was serving as pilot aboard the steamboat Platte. Twelve miles downriver from Fort Leavenworth one of the guys of the yawl derrick broke, sending the yawl adrift down the river. The yawl was so essential for navigating the steamboat up the Missouri River that its loss would have proven irreparable. Aware of the possible predicament, LaBarge jumped into the river and swam over to the yawl, gained control and landed it a short distance downstream from the Platte, an episode which demonstrated LaBarge's ability as a swimmer. In 1847, acting as captain and pilot aboard the steamboat Martha, LaBarge journeyed up the Missouri River carrying supplies for various Indian tribes on the upper Missouri River. For several years Captain Sire had made this journey but had decided to retire from the river, leaving LaBarge in command of the boat and in charge of the Company's business. LaBarge's wife, Pelagie, was also aboard. The trip north went without incident until they arrived at Crow Creek in the Dakota Territory, not far from a trading post owned and operated by Colin Campbell, who had a large supply of fire-wood ready as fuel for the steamer. In an effort to prevent refueling the vessel, a raiding party of Yanktonian Sioux Indians took possession of the woodpile, demanding payment. During the incident they boarded the vessel and killed one of the crewmen, and then drowned the boiler fires. Aboard the boat was a cannon which was in the engine room having its carriage repaired. While the Indians were occupied towards the front of the vessel LaBarge had the cannon brought up to the cabin and loaded. Lighting a cigar and, holding the cannon in plain view of the Indians, he directed them to leave at once or he would \\"blow them all to the devil\\". In a panic, the fleeing Indians fell over one another to get off the boat.Chittenden, 1903, vol I, pp. 177‚Äì181 In 1850 LaBarge was making a voyage aboard the steamer Saint Ange heading for Fort Union, on the upper Missouri River in the dense wilderness of north-west North Dakota. LaBarge's wife and other ladies were aboard, his wife being among the first white women to ever see the fort.Thompson, 1986, p. 61 Along the way a boy fell overboard from the forecastle. LaBarge was nearby and immediately dove into the river and seized him, keeping the boy from being taken in by the steamboat's sidewheel and got the youth safely to shore, an event that again demonstrated LaBarge's ability as a skilled swimmer.Chittenden, 1903, vol I, p. 54 Saint Louis, home town of LaBarge Riverfront scene, depicting riverboat activity LaBarge exceeded the existing speed record for steamboats on the Missouri that year when he piloted Saint Ange, with more than a hundred passengers aboard, from Saint Louis to Fort Union at the mouth of the Yellowstone River in twenty-eight days. The next year, departing from Saint Louis, he set yet another record with the same steamboat to the Poplar River, the farthest point north on the Missouri river ever reached by a steamboat. Aboard were the notable Jesuit missionaries, Fathers Pierre-Jean De Smet and Christian Hoecken, Catholic missionaries who were working with and teaching Christianity to the various Indian tribes in the North country.Chittenden, 1903, vol I, pp. 193‚Äì194Missouri Historical Review, 1969, p. 456 LaBarge was a close friend of De Smet, and always offered the services of his steamboat to the Catholic missionary effort.Chittenden, 1905, Vol. II, p. 62 After LaBarge's record-breaking journey he sold the Saint Ange and retired temporarily at age thirty-six with the fortune he had amassed. Two years later he was back on the river, buying, selling and building steamboats. Before long he was in the trading business once again. In 1855 the American Fur Company sold Fort Pierre, which was also used as a trading post, to the U.S. government. At that time LaBarge had purchased and supervised the completion of a new steamboat he named the Saint Mary, which he used in making the transfer of the former post to the War Department's new post further north in South Dakota, near Chantier Creek, and in moving the Fur Company's inventory and supplies there. LaBarge was then commissioned to transport army personnel to the newly acquired fort.Missouri Historical Review, 1969, pp. 456‚Äì457Chittenden, 1903, vol I, pp. 200‚Äì201 In 1852, Captain Edward Salt-Marsh arrived from Ohio to Saint Louis with the Sonora, a steamboat that LaBarge considered \\"an excellent craft\\". After learning it was up for sale, and following lengthy negotiations, LaBarge purchased the Sonora from the captain for $30,000. Using the Sonora, he made a trip up to Fort Union with their annual outfit of supplies. His next order of business took him to New Orleans where he operated for the remainder of the season, and found plenty of business left by many captains and crews who abandoned the city because of a yellow fever scare. That autumn he sold the Sonora and purchased a smaller vessel, the Highland Mary, which he put to work in the lower Missouri river during the entire season of 1853, after which he sold this vessel that autumn.Chittenden, 1903, vol I, p. 199 By 1854 Captain LaBarge was commissioned by the U.S. government most of the time. During the previous winter Colonel Crossman, of the U.S. Army Quartermaster stationed in St. Louis, contracted a shipbuilding company operating on the Osage River for a steamboat for use by the government. It would be named the Mink. When the hull was almost completed LaBarge brought the boat down into the river and supervised her completion and worked as her pilot during the entire season.Chittenden, 1903, vol I, p. 53 =Journey with brother= As early as 1834, new speed and distance records for steamboats were being established on the Missouri River. That year the steamboat Assiniboine reached a point near the mouth of Poplar River, a hundred miles above the Yellowstone River, but because of low water levels remained there for the duration of the winter. This remained the farthest point reached by steamboats until 1853 when the steamboat El Paso surpassed this point by 125 miles, five miles above the mouth of Milk River, which came to be known as El Paso point. This marked the uppermost limit of steamboat navigation for the following six years.Chittenden, 1903, Volume I, pp. 217-218 In the spring of 1859 the American Fur Company sent two vessels up the Missouri River, commanded by LaBarge and his brother, John, with its annual outfit of men and supplies. The Company employed its own boat, the Spread Eagle, and chartered a second riverboat, called the Chippewa. It was a light vessel and her owner, Captain Crabtree, was contracted to reach Fort Benton, 31 miles below the Great Falls, or as far past this point as was possible. At Fort Union Crabtree defaulted in his contract and the Chippewa was sold to the Company for a sum about equal to its charter price. At this time, freight from the Spread Eagle was transferred to the Chippewa. The Spread Eagle was commanded by Captain LaBarge, while his brother, John, assumed command of the Chippewa. On July 17, 1859, the Chippewa made her way successfully, to within fifteen miles of Fort Benton, and unloaded her cargo at Brule bottom, where Fort McKenzie had once stood. In so doing she had thus managed to reach a point further from the sea by river navigation than any other boat had up to this time. =Independent= LaBarge permanently ended his service to the American Fur Company in 1857 and spent the next three years mainly on the lower Missouri river, rarely venturing beyond Council Bluffs. By the summer of 1859 he built himself a new steamboat, considered one of the best vessels to navigate the Missouri River. Pierre Chouteau, Jr., LaBarge's former employer from the American Fur Trade, having heard about his undertaking, offered any assistance he may have needed, as the Company still valued LaBarge's services and would gladly have given him employment again. Having thanked Mr. Chouteau, LaBarge declined his offer. Upon completion of his new steamboat, LaBarge named her the Emilie, after one of his daughters. LaBarge was now the proud owner, designer, builder, and master of his own private riverboat. The Emilie soon became one of the most famous boats on the Missouri River. She was a sidewheel vessel, 225 feet in length, had a beam of 32 feet, with a hold 6 feet deep, and could easily carry cargoes of up to 500 tons. The riverboat proved to be an exceedingly beautiful vessel. LaBarge embarked on Emilie's maiden voyage on October 1, 1859, which happened to be his forty-fourth birthday.Chittenden, 1903, vol I, pp. 240‚Äì241Missouri Historical Review, 1969, pp. 458‚Äì459 In the summer of 1859 Abraham Lincoln came west and toured the Missouri River looking into real estate investments, where LaBarge saw the future president for the first time. Lincoln was a passenger on the Emilie, which carried him to Council Bluffs, Iowa.Chittenden, 1903, Vol. I, pp. 241‚Äì242 During autumn of that year, river ice prevented the Emilie from proceeding while docked near Atchison, Kansas, which kept LaBarge there for the duration of the winter. When spring arrived the citizens of Atchison, offering to supply fuel for his steamboat, asked LaBarge if they could employ his steamboat for use as an ice-breaker to open a passage between Atchison and Saint Joseph, some twenty miles to the north. LaBarge maneuvered the bow of his boat up on to the ice and with its enormous weight broke through, doing this repeatedly to Saint Joseph. The next year the winter's river ice once again caught LaBarge and the Emilie near Liberty, Missouri. While detained there he heard the news that his former passenger, Lincoln, had been elected president. A few months later the Confederates fired upon Fort Sumter in South Carolina and the Civil War became a reality.Chittenden, 1903, Vol. I, p. 247 =Civil War era= When the Civil War broke out in 1861, people along the Missouri River were largely sympathetic to the South. Although somewhat sympathetic also, Captain LaBarge remained loyal to the Union and took an oath of allegiance to the Union, not wanting to see the nation divided. While operating on the Missouri River, Confederate general John S. Marmaduke, whom LaBarge knew well, placed LaBarge under arrest and seized his boat and crew at Boonville and ordered him to transport Sterling Price, another Confederate general who was ill, to Lexington, Missouri. LaBarge and his crew were free to leave, but he knew that news of his help to the Confederates would soon reach Union authorities. He subsequently appealed to General Price, explained his situation, and asked him for help. Price wrote a letter for him, stating that LaBarge had acted under duress and was forced to help against his repeated protests. The incident landed LaBarge in trouble with Union authorities, but under the circumstances he was allowed to continue operating on the river for the remainder of the war.Chittenden, 1903, vol II, pp. 255‚Äì256 In the winter of 1861‚Äì1862 LaBarge and several partners formed the firm of LaBarge, Harkness & Co., based in Saint Louis, for purposes of trading on the upper Missouri River. Members of the firm included LaBarge, his brother John, James Harkness, William Galpin and Eugene Jaccard. Each member put up $10,000 with which two steamboats were purchased; The Emilie, a large steamer, and the Shreveport, a shallow draft vessel. The LaBarge brothers managed affairs concerning the steamboats, while Harkness went to Washington to obtain the necessary permits from the Interior Department, and to establish friendly relations with the Office of Indian Affairs.Sunder, 1965, p. 234 Supplies and tools were also purchased for building a store to sell furs and other goods in what would become the Montana Territory two years later. Their venture was short- lived because Harkness was not suited for the arduous task of managing such an enterprise on the frontier; LaBarge, Harkness & Company disbanded and sold their wares to the American Fur Company, at Fort Benton in 1863.Chittenden, 1903, vol II, p. 287‚Äì288Thompson, F. M., 2004, p. 259Historical Society of Montana: Diary of James Harkness, 1896, p. 343 On April 30, John LaBarge, aboard the Shreveport, embarked northward for Fort Benton with 75 passengers aboard and all the cargo the vessel could carry. Two weeks later LaBarge, piloting the Emilie, set out, loaded with 160 passengers and 350 tons of freight, and in the process set speed and distance records. The Emilie completed its trip upriver, covering 2,300 miles in thirty-two days.Missouri Historical Review, 1969, pp. 459‚Äì460 This was the first time LaBarge had been more than a hundred miles above Fort Union. Some of the passengers were making the trip because of reports of gold in the Dakota and Washington territories. Several days before the two steamboats embarked, Harkness had gone ahead by railroad to Saint Joseph where he began recording the venture in his private journal. His first entry read: > St. Joseph, Mo., May 18, 1862. About one-third of this place has been burned > and destroyed by the army. Took on ten passengers and left at 4 P.M. Weather > very good. Made a good run. We are five hundred and seventy-five miles above > St. Louis. By June 17, with the Missouri River four feet higher than ever known before, LaBarge and his partners decided to stop ten miles above Fort Benton, where they built a trading post, naming it Fort LaBarge. Race with the Spread Eagle LaBarge, Harkness & Co., and the American Fur Company, were fierce competitors in the fur trading business. In the spring of 1862 the two companies were about to make their annual trip up the Missouri River to Fort Benton with men and supplies. Each company, and their captains, were determined to get to the fort before the other. The Spread Eagle, owned by the American Fur Company, and commanded by Captain Bailey, departed Saint Louis first, two days before LaBarge departed in the Emilie, the faster of the two vessels. The Emilie soon caught up to the Spread Eagle at Fort Berthold at which point the journey turned into a frantic race. In an act of desperation, Bailey rammed LaBarge's boat, but after LaBarge threatened to resort to lethal force if Bailey did not cease, almost starting a shootout, the attempt was aborted. Regardless, LaBarge managed to bring his damaged boat to the fort four days before the Spread Eagle, which finally arrived on June 20. Bailey was soon held accountable for damages and reckless endangerment when he returned to Saint Louis, but LaBarge one month later pardoned him, allowing his reinstatement.Chittenden, 1903, Vol. II, pp. 290‚Äì291Chittenden, 1905, Vol. II, p. 778Barbour, 2001, p. 194O'Neil, 1975, p. 30 =Custer's Campaign= Captain LaBarge also saw service in General Custer's campaign in 1876. In the autumn, when water levels on the upper Missouri River were low, a light-draft riverboat was needed, prompting the U.S. government to commission LaBarge and his steamboat, the John M. Chambers, to transport food and supplies to Fort Buford. LaBarge left Saint Louis on August 5 and reached Fort Buford on September 2. After the cargo was unloaded, Brigadier General Alfred Terry with a company of troops and an artillery piece were brought aboard. The steamboat started out for Wolf Point early on the morning of August 12, with the objective of heading off the Indians in that vicinity. LaBarge made about thirty miles that day, making one stop at Fort Union to drop off General William Babcock Hazen and pick up a load of beef for the troops.Chittenden, 1903, Volume 2, pp. 390-392 On August 13, because of low water levels, LaBarge was only able to travel some twenty miles. The next day the party stopped to investigate a broken-down hospital ship abandoned on the shore, which was found to have been used by Major Marcus Reno's troops who were now pursuing the Indians. As they proceeded on, LaBarge came upon a small party coming down the river from Montana who brought news of Reno and his encounter with the Indians. The party boarded LaBarge's vessel and the next day made the return trip down the Missouri. On the 15th LaBarge arrived at Reno's camp. The Indians had already crossed the river, and Captain LaBarge immediately began the task of ferrying Reno's troops over, which was accomplished before nightfall. LaBarge then left for Buford the next morning, with General Terry, his staff, and 270 troops. LaBarge reached Fort Buford on August 17, and the John M. Chambers was discharged. Later life After more than fifty years on the rivers, Captain LaBarge retired from steamboat piloting in 1885. By then steamboats could not compete with the ever emerging railroads. By 1866 there were only 71 steamboats in active service which could feasibly only service the river between Saint Louis and Kansas City. From 1890 to 1894 LaBarge worked for the city of Saint Louis. Thereafter he found employment with the federal government documenting steamboat wrecks that occurred on the Missouri River. Hiram Chittenden, LaBarge's first biographer Captain LaBarge managed to survive most of his associates involved with shipping and trade on the Missouri River, and was often consulted by historians and others who had occasion to recover accounts about people and events involved with the Missouri's early history.Chittenden, 1903, Volumes I, p. 439 In 1896, LaBarge biographer Hiram M. Chittenden, an officer in the Army Corps of Engineers,Caldbick, 2017, Essay decided to publish an account of steamboat wrecks that occurred on the Missouri River in an attempt to determine which types of improvements for navigation were needed. Searching for information he sought out LaBarge, who was now retired, and who possessed an extensive and often first-hand knowledge of steamboat history from his many years of navigating on the Missouri River. Though LaBarge was willing to work at no cost, Chittenden hired him as his consultant and assistant. In the process, Chittenden soon discovered how knowledgeable and involved LaBarge was with Missouri River history overall and decided to do a biography about the man himself, asking him to compile his documents and correspondence and offer his personal recollections of his lifetime career as a riverman, trader and riverboat captain on the Missouri River. Work was moving along steadily until Chittenden was interrupted when he was called away during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War of 1898. While stationed in Huntsville, Alabama, Chittenden received news in 1899 from Saint Louis that LaBarge had taken ill and was dying. He immediately telegraphed LaBarge's son asking him to assure LaBarge that \\"...I shall faithfully finish his work. It will take me a long time, but I shall not fail to do it.\\" Chittenden's pledge reached LaBarge, who had been suffering from a tumor on his neck, just before he passed away one and a half hours later,Dobbs, 2015, p. 87 after an unsuccessful surgery, from blood poisoning on April 3, 1899, in Saint Louis. LaBarge was 83. Four years later, in 1903, Chittenden completed and published his two-volume biography of LaBarge and his life on the Missouri River.Chittenden, 1903, Volumes I & II, title pages In Volume II of his work he quotes LaBarge expressing his love of the Missouri River. A natural and prominent rock formation rising 150 feet above the Missouri River in Chouteau County, Montana, was named LaBarge Rock, is his honor. On Thursday morning, April 6, LaBarge's funeral was held at Saint Francis Xavier Cathedral in Saint Louis, and drew a large gathering. Attending Jesuits expressed their gratitude to LaBarge who, throughout his career, had offered his steamboat services to their missionary efforts, at no cost. A solemn high mass was held by Archbishop Kain, who was assisted by eight priests. Six of LaBarge's grandsons acted as pall bearers. Father Walter H. Hill, a lifelong friend of LaBarge, gave the final funeral sermon, expressing that LaBarge had led a good life and that no stigma or vice could be attached to his name. He was buried in his home state of Missouri in Calvary Cemetery near the Missouri River.Chittenden, 1903, Volume II, pp. 440‚Äì442 In 2002, Joseph LaBarge was inducted into the National Rivers Hall of Fame, sponsored by The National Mississippi River Museum, as \\"The most renowned mountain boat pilot on the upper Missouri River.\\" See also * Manuel Lisa, merchant, fur trader, led the first trading expedition to the upper Missouri River in 1807 * Grant Marsh, notable fur trader of the far west during LaBarge's day * North American fur trade * Pacific Fur Company * Rocky Mountain Fur Company * Walk- in-the-water (steamboat) and Ontario (steamboat), first steamboats to run on the Great Lakes Notes  Citations  Bibliography      * (Also in PDF format.)  = Online sources =  Further reading   Manuscript prepared for Pierre L.

Description  Canthigaster rivulata is a fish which grows up to 15‚Äì20 cm length. Its body has 2 longitudinal dark bands that join in front of the gill slit, lower band that is either faint or absent, small dark spots in the ventral area, caudal fin with dark stripes and a dark blotch at the caudal base.  Distribution and Habitat  This species are found in tropical waters of Indo-Pacific. It can be seen in the waters from East Africa south to Natal, South Africa and east to Hawaii, north to southern Japan and south to north western Australia. They are usually near rocky and coral reefs that are 100 metres deep however they are also found around shore lines that are around 30 metres deep.  Diet  Canthigaster rivulata is omnivorous and preys mainly on algae, echinoderms and molluscs.  Behaviour and Breeding  This pufferfish is a solitary animal. Its breeding season is in Summer and during this time, the male presents its breeding colour which shows vibrant blue patterns around its body.  Poison  The fish has the poison, tetrodotoxin, resided in the intestine, liver but mostly in the skin and the mucus generated by it, however it is not present in the muscle or the ovary like most other Pufferfish. Its mucus has high risk of contamination of the toxin to other fish or human due to direct contact with the skin.

The main characteristic that distinguishes operational analytics from other types of analytics is that it is analytics on the fly which means that signals emanating from various parts of a business are processed in real-time to feed back into instant decision- making for the business. Some people refer to this as \\"continuous analytics,\\" which is another way to emphasize the continuous digital feedback loop that can exist from one part of a business to its other parts.  Overview  The rapid digital transformation of many businesses means that an increasing number of business signals are being recorded and stored in digital form. Businesses are using these signals to improve their efficiency, improve their performance and provide better experiences to their users and customers. A Forrester Report details how digitization of a business is impacting its customer experiences by leveraging data. Operational analytics allows you to process various types of information from different sources and then decide what to do next: what action to take, whom to talk to, what immediate plans to make. Gartner defines this as Continuous Intelligence in a research report and goes on to describe this as a design pattern in which real-time analytics are integrated within a business operation, processing current and historical data to prescribe actions in response to events. Andressen Horowitz describes this as ...more and more decisions are automated away altogether‚Äîthink of Amazon continually updating prices for its products throughout the day. This form of analytics has become popular with the digitization trend in almost all industry verticals, because it is digitization that furnishes the data needed for operational decision-making. Lets discuss a few examples of operational analytics. A product manager looks at product-usage logs to determine which features of the product are liked by its users, which features slow them down, and which features are disliked by its users. The product manager can gather all these answers by querying data that records usage patterns from the product's user base; and he or she can immediately feed that information back to make the product better. Similarly, in the case of marketing analytic in the pre-digitized world, a marketing manager would organize a few focus groups, try out a few experiments based on their own creativity and then implement them. Depending on the results of experimentation, they would then decide what to do next. An experiment may take weeks or months. In the digitized world, there is the \\"marketing engineer,\\" a person who is well- versed in using data systems. These marketing engineers can run multiple experiments at once, gather results from experiments in the form of data, terminate the ineffective experiments and nurture the ones that work, all through the use of data-based software systems. The more experiments they can run and the quicker the turnaround times of results, the better their effectiveness in marketing their product. An MIT Technology Review article describes how a ride-sharing application uses algorithms for real-time monitoring of traffic and trip times to balance demand and supply for ride sourcing‚Äîand to adjust fees accordingly and rapidly. The use of operations analytics is not confined to the field of information technology. Data from business intelligence, finance, science, weather, and even current events are combined and then analyze together to extract valuable insight from it, and this in turn, drives quick decision making in almost every conceivable use. A metrics collection system like Scuba is an operational analytics system because it is used extensively for interactive, ad hoc, analysis queries that run in under a second over live data.  Definition of an operational analytics processing engine  The definition of an operational analytics processing engine (OPAP) can be expressed in the form of the following six propositions: # Complex queries: Support for queries like joins, aggregations, sorting, relevance, etc. # Low data latency: An update to any data record is visible in query results in under than a few seconds. # Low query latency: A simple search query returns in under a few milliseconds. # High query volume: Able to serve at least a few hundred concurrent queries per second. # Live sync with data sources: Ability to keep itself in sync with various external sources without having to write external scripts. This can be done via change- data-capture of an external database, or by tailing streaming data sources. # Mixed types: Allows values of different types in the same column. This is needed to be able to ingest new data without needing to clean them at write time.  System requirements  Operational Analytics is a subset of the broader set of processes that characterizes OLAP (online analytical processing). As such, it inherits the large data sizes and complex queries that OLAP systems typically has to handle. However, the characteristics that uniquely identify operational analytics is the requirement for quick predictions based on most recent signals. This means that the data latency and query latency are very small. For example, operational analytics applied to real time business processes specify that data latency be zero. It also means that queries should be fast and finish at interactive speeds. Because these decisions are taken at a micro-level and are very personalized to each individual entity, operational analytics processing is characterized by how easy it is to deliver personalized recommendations using such a system.

He was the first of five children born to Samuel Kaye (1861 ‚Äì 1928) and Florence Hill Kaye, n√©e Kimbell (1865 ‚Äì 1944). Service Kaye enlisted in the United States Army Air Service at the start of the Great War. He was sent to the Aviation Field School at Austin, Texas, and then to flight training at Chanute Field in Illinois. He was ordered to Europe and arrived in England in November 1917. Kaye's first assignment was as a ferry pilot flying between Paris and London. Then, on 9 July 1918, he was assigned to the 94th Aero Squadron, 1st Pursuit Group, at Saints Aerodrome, Saints, France. The 94th was known as the \\"Hat in the Ring\\" Squadron and was under the command of Captain Eddie Rickenbacker. Kaye was awarded his first Distinguished Service Cross for action over the region of Epinonville, France, on Sept. 29, 1918.

Kaye‚Äôs four credited victories came on 29 September 1918, 5 October 1918, 18 October 1918, and 29 October 1918. He held the rank of 1st Lieutenant during each of these. In the action of 5 October, Kaye and fellow squadron mate 1st Lt. John N. Jeffers each downed a Fokker D-VII, which was witnessed from the ground by C.O. Rickenbacker and Chambers, who were returning to Rembercourt after retrieving a German Hanover that had been downed intact at Montfaucon on 3 October. Kaye flew SPAD S.XIII, serial S15130. The Armistice went into effect on 11 November 1918. Kaye was promoted to Captain by 18 November 1918. On 23 December 1918, Kaye was awarded Distinguished Service Cross 2nd Oak Leaf Cluster for action at Epinonville on 29 September and Montfaucon on 5 October. Post-War Kaye returned to Columbus, Mississippi, on June 15, 1919.Ward, Rufus, \\"Columbus Chronicles: Tales From East Mississippi\\", Arcadia Publishing, unnumbered page. Aerial Age Weekly reported on 12 April 1920 that Kaye had been awarded the Croix de Guerre with Bronze Star. Sam Kaye continued to live in Columbus after his return from France and operated The Columbus Auto Co. which was the local Ford dealership. Death Kaye died 12 March 1939 after an extended illness. Unable to attend the funeral because of a business commitment, Eddie Rickenbacker sent a huge floral arrangement forming the insignia of the Hat in the Ring Squadron. He was buried at Friendship Cemetery in Columbus, Mississippi. Commemoration On 6 August 1941, a newly established United States Army Air Force training base, established at Columbus, Mississippi, was designated an Air Corps Advanced Flying School. On 15 September 1941, it became known as Columbus Airfield. On 24 February 1942, the War Department announced the installation would be named Kaye Field in honor of Capt. Samuel Kaye Jr., \\"a World War I flying ace.\\" The name did not last long, however. On 27 March 1942, the War Department announced that the base name had been changed from Kaye Field to Columbus Army Flying School to avoid confusion with nearby Key Field in Meridian, Mississippi. After several more name changes, the installation became Columbus Air Force Base on 24 June 1948. In 2007 the Auditorium at Columbus Air Force Base was named in Kaye‚Äôs honor and his uniform is displayed there. Family Kaye‚Äôs son, John M.

It was one of the last models to be produced by Meccanica Verghera at their Cascina Costa plant. Background 125 cc was a popular class in Italy, MV having produced four-stroke 125s since 1954, including sports models such as the \\"125 Rapido Sport\\" model, produced from the second half of the 1950s, and the \\"GTLS\\" of the early 1970s. Following the death of Count Domenico Agusta in 1971, the financial situation of MV Agusta suffered a rapid decline, brought on by competition from low cost, high quality Japanese motorcycles and ongoing labour problems. For 1975, MV Agusta range was reduced to 3 models, all of which were new. They were presented at a press conference in Milan by Corrado Agusta and senior MV staff. The three new models were the 750 Sport America, built at the request of Chris Garville and Jim Cotherman of Commerce Overseas Corporation, the US MV importers; the 350 Ipotesi, styled by Italian designer Giorgetto Giugiaro (who had previously designed the Suzuki RE5); and the 125 Sport SE, which was styled along the lines of the Ipotesi. Although these new model were presented as the beginning of a new era for MV and the start of an ambitious programme of releasing road bikes based on the GP machines, MV Agusta stopped manufacturing motorcycles in 1977. Model Details fairing. Developed from the 125 Sport GTL-S, the machine followed the striking horizontal lines and sharp contours of Giugiaro's Ipotesi. Departing from MV's usual practice of using a mixture of sheet and tubular steel frame a new all tube frame was used, which was finished in silver. Like the Ipotesi, a humped seat with the rear mudguard attached and side panels with slots were fitted. Ceriani front forks and a Scarab disc brake gave the front end a modern look. Although the single-cylinder engine's heritage dates back to the 1950s Centomila (so called because MV Agusta claimed the engine was capable of exceeding 100,000 km), the engine featured new, squarer casings. A square alloy cylinder was fitted with a matching square cylinder head. The pushrod engine retained the 53 x 56 mm bore and stroke of previous engines. Compression ratio was raised to 10.5:1 and, breathing through a 24 mm carburettor, power output was 14 bhp (10 kW) @ 8,500 rpm. Electronic ignition was fitted and the gearbox has 5 speeds. The machine was finished in red and silver with a silver frame and a black exhaust, the traditional colours of the MV GP machines. A fairing was offered as an optional extra.

After a short time in Amsterdam, studying drawing and painting with the portrait and landscape painter, Pleun Piera (1734-1799), he qualified for admission to the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf. Upon graduation, he travelled through Saxony and Holland; eventually settling in Rotterdam in 1794, where he had been commissioned to paint the founders and administrators of the Batavian Society for Experimental Philosophy. He ultimately established his studio in Arnhem and, throughout his career, mostly focused on family paintings. He married Jacomina van Nijmegen (1768-1825) in 1799, with whom he had five children. His own descendants included several other artists; notably his grandson, Taco Jan Scheltema (1831-1867), who is represented in the Louvre, as well as Jan Hendrik Scheltema and Leendert Scheltema (1876-1966), who would specialize in landscapes.

She is the executive director of the social justice non-profit, Women With A Vision.  Career  As a member of Women With Vision (WWAV)--which was co-founded by her mother Catherine Haywood and Danita Muse in 1989 as a grassroots collective to halt the spread of HIV/AIDS in communities of color‚ÄîDeon Haywood helped connect those living with HIV or drug addictions to medical care and recovery programs while also advocating for alleviation of homelessness and affordability issues throughout the rapidly gentrifying post-Hurricane Katrina New Orleans. In 2008 she assumed executive directorship of Women With A Vision (WWAV) with the intent to overturn New Orleans' recently resurrected 203-year-old Crimes Against Nature Statute (CANS). The law, which was originally created to penalize gay sex, was expanded to require anyone prosecuted for prostitution within the past 20 years to register as a sex offender. Beyond losing the ability to live anywhere near schools and having to identify oneself to neighbors, the law also placed sex offender stamps on the state identification card of anyone prosecuted under the statute. Tackling CANS head on, Haywood formed the NO Justice Project in 2009 to raise awareness about the \\"scarlet letter\\" sanction the law placed upon already indigent women. In addition to making the case that CANS made it impossible for these women to find employment or housing with a sex offender registration hanging over their heads, Haywood also built a network of challenges to the statute by organizing protests, raising awareness about the statute's undue burden, and filing legal cases. Pushing the fact that 79% percent of those forced to register under the statute were Black, the NO Justice Project's agenda was given even greater precedence after the United States Department of Justice initiated an investigation that found the New Orleans Police Department had consistently practiced discriminatory policing ‚Äúso severe and so divergent from nationally reported data‚Äù that it epitomized ‚Äúa violation of constitutional and statutory law\\". Prosecution under CANS was left to the discretion of arresting officers who had complete power over whether to apply the statute or to level lesser misdemeanor charges. Overwhelmingly, those targeted by the NOPD were poor Black and transgender women who were frequently baited and arrested by undercover officers even when sex was not offered. Compounding this issue was the fact that though women represented 32% of new HIV diagnoses in 2009, Black women were diagnosed with HIV at rates 11 times greater than their white counterparts. These figures, reported by the Louisiana Department of Health, worsened in 2011. On February 15, 2011, WWAV and its cooperating legal team initiated a lawsuit in the Eastern District of Louisiana on behalf of nine people who had been forced to register as sex offenders through CANS. A month later the NO Justice Project partnered with Representative Charmaine Marchand- Stiaes to revert convictions under the statute to the level of a misdemeanor. That June, the bill was signed into law by then Governor Bobby Jindal. Continuing in federal court, in 2013 the original case was finally settled in favor of the more than 700 people who had been placed on the registry with the stipulation that the Superintendent of the Louisiana State Police agree to remove anyone registered as a sex offender solely because of conviction/s of Crime Against Nature by solicitation.  Arson attack and continued activism  In May 2012, while the CANS case was still waging, Women With A Vision's building was burned down in what the New Orleans Fire Department categorized an aggravated arson. Though no one was injured in the fire, WWAV's equipment and work space were entirely destroyed forcing the organization to temporarily relocate to a local church. News of the attack was reported in major headlines as a hate crime. Following the fire, Haywood doubled down on rebuilding and supporting Black LGBTQ advocacy in Mississippi and Louisiana. This work was assisted by a $100,000 grant from the Elton John AIDS Foundation in recognition of WWAV's success in pinpointing the localized crossover between AIDS, health stigmas, and inequality in the South. This included dismantling misconceptions that the HIV epidemic was contained, exhorting Governor Jindal to expand Medicaid through available funds provided by the Affordable Care Act to fight the epidemic, and investing in alternatives to abstinence only sex education. Additionally Haywood pushed for providing treatment services to people suffering from addiction, arguing that it is a public health issue. She deepened this point by providing studies that proved treatment offered the most effective way to stem Louisiana's devastating HIV transmission rates while also highlighting that in refusing to address the issue of addiction, the state was essentially fueling the epidemic through neglect. Because it lacked no strategic response besides HIV criminalization and discrimination which included denying services to members of the LGBTQ community, New Orleans was eventually labeled America's Ground Zero For HIV.  Combating poverty  In advocating for the working poor, Haywood has frequently targeted rising levels of gentrification which actively displaces natives in the name of post- Hurricane Katrina driven business development and recovery by passing ordinances to outlaw traditional practices, such as playing live music. Appearing on the Melissa Harris Perry Show on MSNBC in 2014 and 2015, she established connections between sex work, consent, and legality while also speaking of the need to provide women with tools to build solvent investments in their lives. That same year she made the case for decriminalizing prostitution in The New York Times by showing that sex work is frequently the only viable source of income for women, particularly single-parent households attempting to pay rent, without the means or education to advocate for themselves and their families. In fighting against criminalization of sex work, Haywood also pointed to long term ramifications of serving time for sex work for women and their families, including barriers to legal forms of employment, increased risk for HIV, and children who end up in foster care. She concluded that decriminalization allows sex workers to speak against abuse without fear of prosecution or retribution from pimps or abusers. In 2017 she was one of 24 leaders of color in the LGBTQ movement to contribute to the Declaration of Liberation, a racial justice strategy for tackling the HIV epidemic. She was appointed to Mayor LaToya Cantrell's Human Relations Commission's Advisory Committee of New Orleans in 2018. In 2019 she raised support against Bill 184's ban on abortion after 6 weeks, equating its passage with an attack on a woman's bodily autonomy. Following the bill's passage she vowed to push for its repeal by inspiring voters.  Awards  In 2010 and 2011 Haywood was spotlighted by TheBody.com for her work in the HIV/AIDS Community as a \\"Person Who Makes A Difference\\". She was made Queen of Krewe du Vieux for the 2012 Mardi Gras with the theme of the parade mirroring her \\"CANS\\" victory: \\"Crimes Against Nature\\". She was named a \\"Health Hero\\" by BET in 2013. That same year she was made the representative for the southern United States to The Human Rights Defenders in Dublin. The following year she was honored by Planned Parenthood for Black History Month, and in 2015 she was honored with the Kiyoshi Kuromiya Award and a grant from the Elton John Aid Foundation. In 2016 Haywood was awarded a Public Voices Fellowship by the Ms. Foundation for Women, the Ben Smith Award from The ACLU and she was designated a Dream Keeper for Black History month, again by Planned Parenthood in 2017. In 2018 she was awarded a fellowship by the Rockwood Leadership Institute and made a Flame Thrower Awardee by The Red Door Foundation. In 2019 she was named a \\"Champion of Pride\\" by The Advocate and awarded the Gloria Award from Gloria Steinem for her work \\"igniting change in communities to ensure equity and opportunity for all women\\".  Personal life  Haywood identifies as a lesbian. She is married to her longtime partner, Shaquita Borden.

History The Three Way Independent School District was formed in May 1945 by the consolidation of Goodland Consolidated Independent School District No. 7, Watson Independent School District No. 10, and Wilson Independent County Line School District No. 14. Three Way School was built on a parcel of land north of Maple. Over the years, several smaller districts - including Stegall (1946) and Bula (1975) ‚Äì consolidated with Three Way. By the 1994‚Äì1995 school year, the district enrolled 127 students. That figure had fallen to 83 by 2001. Faced with declining enrollment and lower funding from the state, Three Way administrators decided that the district would have to consolidate with another larger school district by the start of the next school year. Three neighboring districts ‚Äì Morton, Muleshoe, and Sudan ‚Äì were considered for consolidation. A questionnaire was sent to Three Way ISD parents and registered voters to see which of the candidate districts was most favored. Sudan ISD was selected by 57% of Three Way voters and 59% of Three Way parents. Both school boards approved the decision and the issue was put to a vote on February 2, 2002. In the election, Sudan ISD voters supported consolidation by a 190-1 margin. Of the 80 votes cast by Three Way ISD residents, 54 supported the measure with 26 opposed. The merger of Three Way ISD with Sudan became official on July 1, 2002.

Biography His life is known chiefly from later historical traditions, but his historicity is established by the Umm al-Jimal inscription, written in Greek and Nabataean in , from which it appears that he was a king of the Tanukhids (ŒíŒ±œÉŒπŒªŒµ·Ω∫œÇ ŒòŒ±ŒΩŒøœÖŒ∑ŒΩ·ø∂ŒΩ). From this it appears that he reigned some time in the second half of the 3rd century. The sources differ on Jadhima's origin and parentage: some consider him an Azdite who married into the Tanukhid family by marrying the sister of Malik ibn Zuhayr ibn Amr ibn Fahm, while others consider the Fahmids also as Azdites, and name Jadhima as the son of Malik Ibn Fahm (the brother of Amr ibn Fahm). The southern Arabic tradition on the other hand is entirely different, making Jadhima the son of Amr ibn Rabi'a ibn Nasr, who was settled by the Persian king in al-Hira. According to Gustav Rothstein, however, the southern Arabic tradition is evidently a later invention. In medieval historical sources and literature, Jadhima is portrayed as a pivotal figure in the pre- Islamic history of the Arabs, especially in the context of the Roman‚ÄìPersian Wars over supremacy in the Middle East. However, the historical kernel around which these traditions is impossible to reconstruct today. He is also credited with a number of firsts, such as being the first Arab to use candles, wear sandals, and build catapults. Numerous traditions around him and his companions and family became the subject of poetry and proverbial wisdom. Such episodes include his boon companions, the marriage of his sister Riqash to Adi, and his marriage to, and death by, al-Zabba (Zenobia). Some fragments of poems are also attributed to him, and he is listed among the pre-Islamic poets by later anthologists. He was succeeded by his nephew Amr ibn Adi, the son of Riqash and Adi.p References Sources  Category:3rd-century Arabs Category:3rd-century monarchs in the Middle East Category:Pre-Islamic Arab kings Category:Leprosy Category:Mythological kings ","title":"Jadhima"},{"id":"61489568","text":"J.

P. 62 Summary The chapters 1-9 and 18 of the Fl√≥amanna saga detail Torgils' ancestry according to Sturla √û√≥r√∞arson's version of Landn√°mab√≥k.Fornrit 2011 . Then the saga narrates Torgils' adventures in Iceland and the British Isles. After converting to Christianity from Norse paganism Torgils sailed to Greenland with his wife, companions and serfs. The ship sank off the eastern coast of Greenland and the roughly 30 castaways made their way south with difficulty on account of the ice floes and bad weather. They survived by hunting seals and had to put up with great hardships, including a disease that killed some of them. In the first winter Torgils' wife gave birth to a son. One day, while Torgils climbed a mountain to check the condition of the ice some of the servants murdered the woman and escaped with the boat and the provisions, but the baby was unharmed. Thorgils and a few of the survivors built a small boat with skins and tried to reach the Western Settlement. Miraculously Torgils was able to breastfeed the child. Finally, after four years of struggles since the shipwreck, Torgils managed to reach the Norse settlement on the western coast with only his son and two remaining companions.Spencer Apollonio, Lands That Hold One Spellbound: A Story of East Greenland, 2008 pp. 7-8Clements Markham, G.

Inspired by the \\"semi-fascist\\"See: * Vichy France: Stanley G. Payne (1983). Fascism: A Comparative Approach Toward a Definition.

Fascism Reader p. 313-317 2003 Routledge regimes of Vichy France, Francoist Spain and the Estado Novo, L'≈íuvre Fran√ßaise was‚Äîuntil its dissolution by the authorities in 2013‚Äîthe oldest nationalist association still active in France.  History  = Background: 1949‚Äì1967 = The founder of L'≈íuvre Fran√ßaise, Pierre Sidos, had been a member of the fascist Parti Franciste during WWII. He later established and led the neo-fascist group Jeune Nation (1949‚Äì58). After the dissolution of Jeune Nation, he founded Occident in 1964. And following his departure from the later organization in 1965-66, Sidos began to focus on the creation of another far- right movement. In February 1966, Sidos created with Andr√© Cantelaube the magazine Le Soleil (\\"The Sun\\"), which would become the official organ of L'≈íuvre Fran√ßaise. The periodical was fervently anti-Semite, even described as such by the organ of the Front National's youth movement in 1975. Le Soleil indeed defended an anti-capitalist nationalism that denounced the role of Jews in finance, politics and the industries, as well as the \\"threat\\" represented by the state of Israel on geopolitics. = Creation and emergence: 1968‚Äì1982 = L'≈íuvre Fran√ßaise was founded by Pierre Sidos in April 1968, who declared himself \\"presidor for life\\" (French: pr√©sideur, a portmanteau of pr√©sident and dictateur), and the group held their first congress two years later on 10 October 1970 in Versailles. On this platform, Sidos attempted to run in the 1969 French presidential election but his candidacy was rejected by the Constitutional Council on a technical basis. It has been argued that there was a fear that any judgement in Sidos' favor would have been considered a vindication of his collaborationist background in wider society. Le Soleil, on its side, dismissed the Jewish origin of some members in the council, namely Gaston Palewski and Ren√© Cassin, as the reason for their refusal.Le Soleil, n¬∞99, 2‚Äì15 octobre 1970. In 1973, Sidos ran again as the only L'≈íuvre candidate in the legislative election. In 1982, L'≈íuvre participated in the Regroupement Nationaliste (\\"Nationalist Union\\"), along with Jean-Gilles Malliarakis' Troisi√®me Voie and the magazine-movement Militant. The Regroupement made little headway and soon fell apart. Following an increase in far-right violence at the end of the previous decade, the police considered a first time the possibility of banning the group in 1980, highlighting their own designation as a \\"nationalist guard\\", their organized physical trainings in the woods and obsessional antisemitism as potential risks. They eventually asked the authorities to keep L'≈íuvre under surveillance. = Entryst strategy: 1983‚Äì2012 = After the failure of the Regroupement, L'≈íuvre kept on acting mostly alone among the far-right nebula, and preferred instead developing its own strategy of entryism. They infiltrated and recruited in the police, especially the union FPIP, in which they claimed half the members were L'≈íuvre adherents in the 1990s. In 1993, three militants of L'≈íuvre were arrested while they were planning an attack on Patrick Gaubert, then special adviser in the French government with responsibility for combating racism and xenophobia. Le Soleil banned from publicity and sales to minors in 1990 following the Gayssot Act that outlawed Holocaust denial, the movement launched in early 1994 a new organ named Jeune Nation‚Äîin reference to an older group Sidos had founded nearly forty-five years earlier, and dissolved by decree in 1958. Sidos tried in this period to build a rapprochement with the Front National (FN). In 1996, he announced the rallying of L'≈íuvre to the party, despite the opposition of his right-hand-man Yvan Benedetti. After negotiations with Sidos, Jean-Marie Le Pen allowed some L'≈íuvre militants, notably Benedetti and Alexandre Gabriac, to become part of the FN in 2007. The party however later tightened its policy regarding the association, Marine Le Pen denouncing an \\"operation of entryism\\" to facilitate the seizure of power by her rival Bruno Gollnisch in the FN. Gabriac was eventually ejected from the FN in 2011 after a photo that showed him doing a Nazi salute re-emerged. His expulsion was followed by that of Benedetti the same year, who had defined himself as an \\"anti-Zionist, anti-Semite, anti-Jews\\" in an interview. Gabriac and Benedetti thus decided to establish \\"Jeunesses Nationalistes\\" in 2011 as the youth movement and activist branch of L'≈íuvre, in order to attract militants deceived with the new FN leadership. The following year, Pierre Sidos, then 85, left the presidency after 44 years in office, succeeded by Benedetti. On 25 May 2013, the women's branch, named Les Caryatides, was launched and headed by Marie-Claire Gandillon. = Dissolution and legacy: 2013‚Äìpresent = L'≈íuvre Fran√ßaise was dissolved on 10 July 2013 after the issue of an official decree by the then Minister of the Interior, Manuel Valls. The ban occurred in a context of street violence by far-right revolutionary groups, and followed the death of a far-left activist in a fight involving another nationalist association led by Serge Ayoub. Valls justified the dissolution by denouncing L'≈íuvre as a group \\"organized like a private militia thanks to paramilitary-like training camps.\\" He further added that the association had been \\"spreading a xenophobic and antisemitic ideology, diffusing racist and Holocaust-denying thesis, exalting collaboration [with the Nazis] and the Vichy regime, paying regular tribute to P√©tain, Brasillach or Maurras\\". In 2014, Benedetti and Gabriac ran in the municipal elections of V√©nissieux, in the outskirts of Lyon, inviting electors to \\"slip a quenelle\\" inside the ballot box. They obtained, with 11.5% of the votes, sieges in the city council. The ballot initiated by the two FN dissidents was called \\"V√©nissieux Fait Front\\" and featured most of the candidates that had run for the FN during the previous election, which led Marine Le Pen to denounce Benedetti and Gabriac as \\"parasites\\" and to call for the invalidation of their candidacy. The vote was eventually declared void a few months later by the Conseil d'√âtat due to irregularities in the list of candidates. Following the dissolution of L'≈íuvre, the website of the organ Jeune Nation was re-activated by Yvan Benedetti and Alexandre Gabriac, with the copyright \\"1958‚Äì2013 Jeune Nation\\". In September 2015, Benedetti appealed to join the French Nationalist Party, established back in 1983 and re-activated earlier that year to cope with the dissolution of several far-right groups in 2013. In June 2019, Yvan Benedetti was sentenced to a suspended 8 months jail sentence for \\"recreating a disbanded league\\", L'≈íuvre having kept on operating for several months following the dissolution.  Ideology  Closer to the \\"semi-fascist\\" Francoist Spain and Estado Novo than true fascist regimes, L'≈íuvre Fran√ßaise was nonetheless an antisemitic, racialist and neo-P√©tainist organization, influenced by various conspiracy theories. The movement aimed at dissolving democracy and opposing mass immigration through the \\"deliverance of France and the French from an ideological and economic cosmopolitanism.\\" Its motto was La France aux Fran√ßais (\\"France to the French\\"). = Agenda = Sidos listed Maurice Bard√®che, Charles Maurras, Maurice Barr√®s or √âdouard Drumont as the group's intellectual mentors. During its two first congresses in 1970 and 1975, L'≈íuvre defined their political agenda as the establishment of a \\"nationalist state\\", founded on \\"blood and soil\\" and a Catholic doctrine purged from Jewish influence. The French head of state would be designated by an elite electoral college, similar to the Papal conclave. Political parties and atheism in public life were to be banned, and a \\"corporatist socialism\\" should complete a \\"popular and communitarian state, with the union under the same fasces of all nation activities and forces\\". In its monthly organ Jeune Nation, L'≈íuvre dismissed democracy as the \\"reign of drugs\\", \\"suicide\\" and \\"meaningless words like tolerance, human rights, anti-racism, liberty, that emasculate our youth.\\" = Structure = Designed as a cult of personality, the organization was labeled a sect or a \\"Church of Sidology\\" by competing far right groups, while its adherents highlighted the discipline and determination allowed by their organizational style. Sidos was recognized by L'≈íuvre adherents as the \\"future guide for the people and the nation.\\" Far from being a mass party, the organization had 20 members at its creation, around 50 a decade later, and 400 at the time of its dissolution in 2013. Political scientist Jean-Yves Camus explains the large media coverage compared to the size of the group by an \\"excellent communication from the leadership\\". = Symbols = The emblem of L'≈íuvre Fran√ßaise was a Celtic Cross painted with the French tricolor. The anthem, whose lyrics were written in 1974 by Sidos, was titled \\"Nous voulons rester Fran√ßais\\" (\\"We want to remain French\\").

Items that astronauts chose to carry into space were approved by NASA management and stored in PPKs.  Purpose and specifications  A razor and shaving cream, personal items used by Collins during Apollo 11 The Federal Aviation Regulations (as of January 1, 2001) defined personal preference kits with the following specifications: > A container, approximately 12.82 centimeters x 20.51 centimeters x 5.13 > centimeters (5\\" x 8\\" x 2\\") in size, separately assigned to each individual > accompanying a Space Shuttle flight for carrying personal mementos during > the flight. Additionally, the Federal Aviation Regulations (as of January 1, 2001) limited the contents of PPKs to a maximum of 20 personal items that weigh a total of . As of 2019, the Federal Aviation Regulations state that personal items to be contained in PPKs include \\"flags, patches, insignia, medallions, minor graphics, and similar items of little commercial value\\", and that these items must first be approved by NASA management. Astronauts were required to submit a manifest listing the items to be held in their PPKs, as well as who was to receive the items, sixty days prior to their launch date. After spaceflight missions, some personal items carried in PPKs are put on display, or given as awards to shuttle workers and VIPs. One such item was the sphere of aluminum brought by Frank Borman in his PPK during the Apollo 8 mission, which was later used to strike 200,000 space-flown medallions that were distributed to certain NASA agencies and Saturn contractors that participated in the Apollo program.  Usage in the Gemini program  The astronauts on Project Gemini spaceflights were authorized to bring personal items in only one PPK, which was a nylon drawstring bag. Weight limits and the small amount of space available in the Gemini spacecraft limited the amount of items that could be carried in PPKs.  Usage in the Apollo program  Similar to astronauts in the Gemini program, crew members on Apollo spaceflights were also assigned PPKs in which they could store personal items and souvenirs. The PPKs were made from Beta cloth, a type of fireproof cloth that was added to Apollo/Skylab A7L space suits and used in other specialized applications. Pieces of wood and fabric of the 1903 Wright Flyer taken to the Moon in Armstrong's PPK Five PPKs were carried on Apollo 11: one for each of the three astronauts were carried on Columbia, and two were carried on Eagle Lunar Module. In a special arrangement with the United States Air Force Museum, Neil Armstrong brought wood from the propeller and fabric from the wing of first plane to achieve powered flight, the 1903 Wright Flyer, in his PPK aboard the Lunar Module, which were taken to the Moon on Apollo 11. As part of a joint NASA-USFS project, about 400 to 500 tree seeds from Douglas fir, loblolly pine, redwood, American sycamore, and sweetgum trees were stored in small containers in Stuart Roosa's PPK during the Apollo 14 mission. Upon his return to Earth, many of the seeds were germinated. Their seedlings were planted throughout the United States, Japan, Brazil, and Switzerland, becoming known as \\"Moon trees\\". For the Apollo 17 mission, the PPK was replaced with the astronaut preference kit (APK).

She was not formally recognised in her lifetime but her role as an \\"assistant\\" is now better credited. Life Thornycroft was born in 1873 in Hammersmith into the Thornycroft family, daughter of Blanche Ada (n√©e Coules) (1846‚Äì1936) and John Isaac Thornycroft. She had four sisters, Edith Alice (1871‚Äì1959), Mary Beatrix (1875‚Äì1965), Ada Francis (1877‚Äì1965), and Eldred Elizabeth (1879‚Äì 1939), and two brothers. Her elder brother was John Edward Thornycroft. Her younger brother, Isaac Thomas (known as Tom) worked at the family firm until 1934. Her uncle was the sculptor Sir Hamo Thornycroft. She was the granddaughter of Thomas Thornycroft and Mary Thornycroft. Her father, John Isaac Thornycroft, was knighted in 1902.  Naval Architecture  Although Blanche Thornycroft did not keep regular hours at her father's business, it is acknowledged that she made an unsung contribution to the business. She was trained in the same way as an apprentice would be trained and she was known as her father's assistant. Analysis however of correspondence with her brother and father reveal that she was regarded as a maths expert and her work was well regarded. The Thornycroft family home in Bembridge had a model ship testing facility in its grounds, built in 1884, but disguised as a decorative water system known as ‚ÄúThe Lilypond‚Äù. This was used for complex testing of model ships until 1909, when the need for a larger and indoor test tank was identified. A new test tank, one of the first buildings ever built by pouring concrete over steel, was built at Steyne Woods Battery. The Experimental Boat Testing Tank Facility, at the Steyne Wood Battery in Bembridge on the Isle of Wight, (Grade II Listed Building Number 1426608) has six angled glazed panels below a concrete walkway, linked to a boiler within the battery to warm water, which was installed by Thornycroft as part of her interest in hydroponics. Some of Blanche‚Äôs monographed notebooks, recording her test notes from 1907 until 1939, along with the ship tank models used in her engineering calculations, are held at the Classic Boat Museum in East Cowes. The notebooks record her calculations for tests on the models trialled in the lily pond at the family home and later at the Experimental Boat Testing Tank Facility. These models were the basis for the development of Skimmers (racing motor boats), which later evolved into Coastal Motor Boats. Other models tested ideas for Acasta and Acheron Class Destroyers, motor torpedo boats, RAF Rescue Launches, as well as RNLI Lifeboats.  Royal Institution of Naval Architects  She was one of the first three women to be admitted to the Royal Institution of Naval Architects on 9 April 1919 alongside engineers Rachel Parsons and Eily Keary and was a member of the Women's Engineering Society for twenty years.  Death  Blanche Thornycroft died in Bembridge in 1950.

Recording sessions for the album took place during August of 1973 in Hollywood, California.Sparke, Michael; Venudor, Peter (1998). \\"Stan Kenton, The Studio Sessions\\". Balboa Books. p. 212 . Background Up to the time of 7.5 on the richter scale the band had primarily made recordings of music that were swing oriented with progressive leanings. The 1969 Capitol release of Stan Kenton: the music of 'HAIR' was the only other time Stan Kenton had an entire LP move beyond a style and genre which the Kenton 'brand name' had been built on since 1943. He had no involvement in the Hair LP except for Kenton's name placed on the jacket cover; Ralph Carmichael and Lennie Niehaus were placed in charge of the project. Capitol producer Lee Gillette was trying to exploit the money making possibilities of the popular 1968 musical featuring contemporary rock music. Due to lack of promotion by Capitol, the LP was a financial failure; this would be the last release for Kenton under he aegis of Capitol. The transition from Capitol to Creative World Records in 1970 was fraught with difficulties during a time when the music business was changing rapidly. As a viable jazz artist who was trying to keep a loyal but dwindling following, Kenton turned to arrangers such as Hank Levy and Bob Curnow to write material that appealed to a younger audience. The first releases for the Creative World label were live concerts and Kenton had the control he wanted over content but lacked substantial resources to engineer, mix, and promote what Capitol underwrote in the past. Kenton would take a big gamble to bypass the current record industry and rely far more on the direct mail lists of jazz fans which the newly formed Creative World label would need to sell records.Lee, William F. (1980) \\"Stan Kenton: Artistry in Rhythm\\".

Family Sheppard was born January 31, 1897 in St. John's, NL, the oldest surviving son of Robert Austin Sheppard, I (1865-1909) and Anna Laura Davis (1871-1935). His father was an experienced master mariner of ships employed in international trade, including the Nelly, famous for setting precedent for maritime law in the sale of minority interest in a ship (The Nelly Schneider, Admiralty, April 4 and 5, 1878, Sir R. Phillimore). In 1906, his mother accompanied his father to Sydney, AU and back, likely bringing at least one of their children on the months-long voyage, infant Louis Wakeham Sheppard (b. 1905). Three years later, on the same ocean trek, somewhere between Brazil and New South Wales, his father disappeared, lost at sea with all crew aboard the Amy Louise, a 2 mast, 200 ton, wood brigatine. By March 1, 1920, 23 y Sheppard was a master mariner when he married 19 y Sadie Addison Kean. She was well-aware of the dangers faced by a master mariner as her father (Captain Nathan Barker Kean), grandfather (Captain Abram Kean, OBE), and several of her Kean uncles were well known sealing masters, commemorated in song. Joseph W. Kean, her father's eldest brother, had captained the SS Florizel, but on February 23, 1918 he was on board as a passenger when the Florizel struck a reef in a heavy sea and split in pieces. He suffered a broken leg, was swept overboard, drowned and washed up on shore. On March 15, 1931, her uncle Abraham Baker Kean, captain of the SS Viking, survived injuries when he was catapulted off the bridge by an explosion of dynamite that blew the stern off the vessel, which then caught fire and sank, killing many on board. The film, White Thunder, for which the ship was carrying dynamite to create scenes of icebergs imploding, was edited after the disaster and released as The Viking. Sheppard's descendants include his son, Robert Austin Sheppard, II who fought with the British 59th (Newfoundland) Heavy Artillery Regiment, his daughter, Edna Patricia Sheppard (1923-1998), born at the Fort Amherst lighthouse, who was a research chemist for the US Food and Drug Administration and taught at Memorial University of Newfoundland, and his great-grandson, Nick Whalen, a Member of Parliament for the riding of St. John's East. By 1950 the family was living in Sylvanside, the former summer home of the Hon. John Vincent O‚ÄôDea and Sheppard's last residence, which overlooks Bowring Park (St. John's) in the historic Kilbride neighborhood. Military service Capt. Sheppard was a veteran of the WW1 campaigns in Gallipoli and Beaumont Hamel, serving from September 8, 1914 at 19 y of age with The First Five Hundred, the Newfoundland Regiment in the British Mediterranean Expeditionary Force. He was evacuated from Suvla Bay for frostbite in December 1915; returned to the regiment, and again extricated for injuries, this time at the Western Front in spring of 1916 for a shrapnel wound to his face. According to Dickinson, Sheppard served in France with a wiring party, where his nightly mission was to breach or destroy barbed wire obstacles that were created to maim and trap his fellow soldiers. On July 1, 1916 he suffered multiple machine gun shots to the neck, arm and groin in the Battle of the Somme (Beaumont-Hamel, France) and credited Michael Sears for helping save him. Too extensively wounded to return to the field, he was honorably discharged in March 1917. Lighthouse service The Oke family oversaw the light at Fort Amherst for nearly a century, beginning circa 1848 with Robert Oke as the first Chief Inspector for the Newfoundland Lighthouse Service, whose responsibilities were to oversee the budget, staffing and repairs of lighthouses. In 1841, his daughter, Mary Ann Oke (1819-1896), married John Sheppard (1816-1890), an assistant lighthouse keeper at Harbour Grace Island since 1836, and they moved to manage the Fort Amherst lighthouse in 1852. They passed down the lighthouse trade through another 3 generations: their son, Austin Oke Sheppard (1844-1927); grandson, Robert Austin Sheppard, I (1865-1909); and, great grandson, Sheppard, whose keeper service spanned 14 y from 1924 to 1938. However, Sheppard's young family was residing at the lighthouse earlier than the official start of his keeper's service, at least by 1923 when his daughter was born. In September 1934, keeper Sheppard hosted Sir John Hope Simpson, KBE CIE OBJ (1868‚Äì1961) and Lady Quita Hope Simpson (1870-1939) for tea and a tour of the lighthouse. Sheppard's mother \\"Annie\\" was living with him at the Fort Amherst lighthouse at the time of her death in 1935, as was Sheppard's only sister, Edna Sheppard (1898-1988), who was a telephone operator in the Office of the Colonial Secretary, including for the Hon. Arthur Barnes. Fort Amherst was designated one of the National Historic Sites of Canada in 1951. Mariner and harbor master Despite losing his father at an early age to the sea, Sheppard followed in his footsteps, pursuing a career as captain of a square rig. Dickinson suggests he was mentored by his uncle, the locally renowned master mariner Captain Robert Whiting Wakeham, who was decorated numerous times for heroism at sea. According to Horwood, \\"... in Newfoundland, there were three classes of men that were respected above all others. The first was the man who had become the captain of a square rigger; the second a school teacher; the third a ship owner.‚Äù Recommended by the military for navigation and seamanship studies, Sheppard sailed to the Caribbean and Mediterranean on schooners carrying salt fish in one direction and returning to Newfoundland with rum, molasses and other products. During the Second World War he served as a British merchant navy master in transatlantic convoys. After the fall of France, he brought confiscated French ships across the Atlantic and in 1940 he survived the Swansea Blitz and the bombing of a convoy by Germany. In 1944, he accepted a position as the harbor master in St. John‚Äôs, NL, but just months later Bowring Brothers, owner of a number of sealing vessels, recommended him to the Operation Tabarin committee. As the holder of master‚Äôs tickets in both sail and steam, he was qualified to command such a mission. Operation Tabarin Sheppard commanded two ships, the SS Eagle (1944‚Äì1945) and the SS Trepassey (1945‚Äì1946), both chartered by Britain for the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS) during exploration of the Antarctic in Operation Tabarin. Sheppard personally selected his crew of twenty-seven Newfoundlanders, most with decades-long experience working in ice. The Eagle left St. John‚Äôs on October 24, 1944 and by the end of the year had made it to the port of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil After a stop in Montevideo, Uruguay they reached Port Stanley (Falkland Islands) in January 1945. Loaded with supplies, the Eagle set off on the 600 mile crossing, but hit a blizzard and a gale approaching Deception Island (South Shetland Islands). During one particularly hard and sudden lurch of the vessel in the storm, Sheppard fell off the bridge onto the deck, breaking 3 ribs and was temporarily knocked unconscious. Despite constant pain that curtailed his movement, he managed to steer the vessel for several trips between Deception Island and Hope Bay (Antarctic Peninsula), dodging calving icebergs, and working with the crews of the William Scoresby and Fitzroy to establish Base D at Hope Bay on February 12, 1945. They delivered the shore party, huskies, construction materials and all manner of cargo needed for research and survival. On March 17, 1945, another hurricane raged over Hope Bay, with a force that snapped the Eagle‚Äôs anchor and drove the vessel into a massive iceberg, then into a second iceberg, and came close to colliding with a third. Due to the damaged stern and bow, the blinding snow and gale force winds, Sheppard was preparing the men to beach the ship and swim to shore. However, the clouds lifted, the wind abated, good sight lines were restored, and he steered the Eagle for Port Stanley. The ship was repaired sufficiently to reach Uruguay for a substantial overhaul. The voyage resumed to Brazil, British Guiana, and Trinidad. It was here that Sheppard turned over the ship to another captain as he had orders to fly back to St. John's to outfit a ship to replace the damaged Eagle. On Sunday, July 23, 1950, the S.S. Eagle, dressed with a string of flags, was towed through The Narrows, St. John's and scuttled (intentionally sunk) off Sugarloaf Head, NL in the vicinity of Cordelia Deeps. The second ship charted by the British Admiralty FIDS, was the Trepassey, obtained from the Newfoundland Railway. Sheppard steered from St. John's on November 20, 1945, with his wife Sadie and son, seaman Robert Austin Sheppard, II, on board. Due to wretched conditions, including rotting whale meat, Sadie stayed in Montevideo when the crew headed south. Again working with the local Fitzroy and the William Scoresby, Sheppard relieved the men and re-equipped the bases at Hope Bay, Deception Island and Port Lockroy aided by a nautical chart drawn from a hydrographic survey. Conducted at his request, data were obtained the previous winter by taking depth soundings through holes cut in the ice. Then they established Base C at Cape Geddes on Laurie Island, South Orkneys in January 1946, restocked Base A at Port Lockroy and deposited emergency supplies at the closed Base C at Sandefjord Bay and at an abandoned hut on Winter Island, Argentine Islands. The Trepassey was the lone ship used to set up Base E, so they packed up as much supplies as the vessel could haul, 46 Labrador huskies, and the research personnel and steered further south to Marguerite Bay, Stonington Island, where offloading continued from February into March of 1946. After this, the ship and crew made ten trips to jettison 1000 tons of surplus war bombs, anti-aircraft shells, depth charges and small arms ammunition into the sea. While returning to St. John's, Sheppard was informed by radio that he was a recipient of the Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) award. After the 9 month expedition, the Trepassey steamed into St. John's harbor in July 1946, completing its British charter. Dickinson and Taylor, both credit Sheppard and his crew's devotion to duty in the face of personal adversity as contributing significantly to the establishment of new bases to expand scientific and surveying programs for the FIDS and Operation Tabarin. Legacy Sheppard was a 5th generation Newfoundland lighthouse keeper and, along with his son, were the last known descendants of Robert Oke to officially practice the trade. He was commemorated in the poem, Fort Amherst - Then and Now, by Rosalind Power, who grew up at Fort Amherst, where her father was a lighthouse keeper (1949-1972). Sheppard is listed on the nominal roll of those serving with the Royal Newfoundland Regiment who were wounded during the Battle of the Somme at Beaumont Hamel in 1916. Every July 1, people gather at the National War Memorial (Newfoundland) to remember Sheppard and others who served. While at Hope Bay, Sheppard became the first Newfoundlander to visit the ruins of a stone shelter built by the Swedish Antarctic Expedition in 1903. Now Historic Monument 39 (HSM 39), it is maintained by Instituto Ant√°rtico Argentino. In his book and collected documents, the expedition's lead surveyor (1943-1946) and second commander (1945-1946), Andrew Taylor, placed several landmarks and photographs at or near \\"Sheppard Island\\", next to \\"Marr Island\\" (named by the expedition after Sheppard and expedition commander (1943-1944) and zoologist, Lt. Cmdr. J.W.S. Marr, RNVR, respectively). Although these namesakes were not officially sactioned by The UK Antarctic Place-names Committee, other locations were. Two points of land were named for Capt. Sheppard, Sheppard Nunatak and Sheppard Point, both at the north entrance of Hope Bay, Trinity Peninsula, Graham Land. Furthermore, a cove on Hope Bay and an adjacent island, were named after the Eagle. Similarly, a bay on the Tabarin Peninsula and an island near Stonington Island were named after the ship Trepassey. Five postage stamps commemorate the ships under Sheppard's command during the mission, two of the Eagle, and three of the Trepassey. A tribute to Sheppard was published in the June 21, 1945, edition of the newspaper, Hope Bay Howler, edited by medical officer, Eric Back: \\"... did not Capt. Sheppard prove conclusively within the spell of four short weeks that he was well worthy to be listed among the great seamen of the Antarctic?

The Survey began at a time when the modern subject of linguistics was evolving and the leaders accepted that the Survey would need to change over time to stay relevant to on-going linguistic work.Petyt (1980), page 95 The original intentions of the Survey were set out by Professor Angus McIntosh in the book Introduction to a Survey of Scottish Dialects. The book argued that different methods were appropriate for different aspects of the survey. Vocabulary was collected by indirect methods such as letters to local schoolteachers, to collect material more easily where there was less chance of a mistake by a non-linguist, whereas phonology and morphology were assessed directly by trained linguists.Petyt (1980), pages 95‚Äì96 The fieldwork for dialects of Scots and Scottish English was undertaken first. This period did not cover the Highlands or Outer Hebrides of Scotland, but it did cover all of Northern Ireland, and the English counties of Cumberland and Northumberland. The Highlands and Islands were later studied in terms of both Scottish Gaelic, and also in mixed use of English and Gaelic (referred to as \\"Highland English\\" and \\"Island English\\").

Stylistically, Bosnia was to be assimilated into the European mainstream (hence the use of historicist architectural styles), save for the appearance of the Orientalist style. Confronted with the multinational population structure in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the government realized that it was necessary to have a political ear when choosing one of the historical styles. For construction in areas where the Bosniak population was predominant, architects used the Moorish Revival style. The aim was to promote Bosnian national identity while avoiding its association with either the Ottoman Empire or the growing pan-Slavic movement by creating an \\"Islamic architecture of European fantasy\\". This style drew its inspiration from the Moorish and Mud√©jar architecture of Spain as well as Mamluk architecture of Egypt and Syria, as exemplified by Mostar Gymnasium. This included application of ornamentations and other \\"Moorish\\" design strategies, neither of which had much to do with prior architectural direction of indigenous Bosnian architecture. As a reaction, architects influenced by the Art Nouveau movement later developed the Bosnian style in architecture.  Main buildings  * The National and University Library (Vijecnica) is the most famous example of Moorish Revival architectural language using decorations and pointed arches while still integrating other formal elements into the design. In 1891, Karel Pa≈ô√≠k worked on another major building in the pseudo-Moorish style ‚Äì The Municipal Hall. Pa≈ô√≠k did not want to accept the request of governor Benjamin Kallay to make it very large and therefore Pa≈ô√≠k's proposal was rejected. The construction was turned over to Alexander Wittek who was inspired by used the Mosque of Kemal II in Cairo. After Wittek's death the construction was completed under ƒåiril Ivekoviƒá's supervision in 1896. However, the building was built in the style originally conceived by Karel Pa≈ô√≠k. During the period of Yugoslavia this building functioned as the National and University Library of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the Bosnian war of the 1990s the building was destroyed and reconstruction was completed in 2014. * Ashkenazi Synagogue: during the Austro-Hungarian condominium Sephardic and Ashkenazy communities lived in Sarajevo. The Ashkenazy community came to Sarajevo after 1878 and began constructing a synagogue in 1901. The form of the temple is bejeweled with sharp angled domes over large ‚Äúdrums‚Äù and covered with pseudo-Moorish decorations. During the construction changes were made by Pa≈ô√≠k and the building was completed in 1902. * Sharia School (Faculty of Islamic Studies): among Karel Pa≈ô√≠k's first projects was the Sarajevo Sharia School. It was constructed in 1887 in a rich Moorish Revival decorative style with elements and details collected from various regional Islamic art schools. The Museum of the City of Sarajevo was opened in the building in 1949 which contained archaeological, historical, ethnographic and art collections. Today this building is used as the Faculty of Islamic Sciences. * Mostar Gymnasium: the Minister of Finance B√©ni K√°llay took it upon himself to provide the new Mostar gymnasium with a proper building. The first design was offered by the Czech architect Max David in 1897, but K√°llay turned it down and gave the project to another Czech architect, Franti≈°ek Bla≈æek. The first half of the gymnasium was completed in 1898 and the second in 1902. Featuring Andalusian and Mamluk elements as an example of Moorish Revival architecture, the gymnasium is of historic value and is considered a national monument.

General Ram√≥n Guill√©n D√°vila, a commanding general of the Anti-Drug National Command was accused of drug trafficking in the 1990s. Ram√≥n Guill√©n D√°vila and his successor Orlando Hern√°ndez Villegas allegedly cooperated with the Central Intelligence Agency in \\"controlled deliveries of cocaine\\" in a program titled \\"Operation North\\".

However, Operation North was performed unknown to the DEA and Venezuelan authorities. Both generals were later pardoned by President Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez in 1993 and the CIA pulled out of Venezuela.

It was released in 1978. Recording The album was recorded using analogue technology in May 1977 in the Grosser Saal (main auditorium) of the Musikverein in Vienna.Mahler, Gustav: Symphonie Nr. 4, cond.

Critical reception Gustav Mahler, photographed by Friedrich Victor Spitzer in 1905 =Reviews= Richard Osborne reviewed the album on LP in Gramophone in June 1978, comparing it with alternative versions of the \\"symphony of heavenly life\\" conducted by Otto KlempererMahler, Gustav: Symphony No. 2, cond. Otto Klemperer, EMI Records LP, ASD 2799, Rafael KubelikMahler, Gustav: Symphony No. 4, conf. Rafael Kubelik, Deutsche Grammophon LP, 2535 119, James LevineMahler, Gustav: Symphony No. 4, cond. James Levine, RCA LP, ARL1 0895 and George SzellMahler, Gustav: Symphony No. 4, cond. George Szell, CBS Classics LP, 61056. Claudio Abbado's reading of the first movement, he wrote, was straightforward, colourful and likeable. Like Szell, Abbado opened with a tempo that was animated without being flustered, and he was meticulous in his obedience to Mahler's accents and dynamics. After a few minutes, though, the \\"apparently episodic\\" character of the movement caused him to lose sight of the wood for the trees. Where Szell had acknowledged the movement's \\"unity in diversity\\" with a \\"steady, treading pulse\\" that \\"[refused] to ignore the thrust of the downbeat\\", Abbado paced the score erratically. Figure 7 exemplified Abbado's \\"losing his way\\" at a point where Szell had managed to allow himself a liberal rubato without disrupting the music's fundamental rhythm.Osborne, Richard: Gramophone, June 1978, pp. 44-51 In the second movement, the Scherzo, Abbado was more successful. His unhurried reading was \\"wonderfully well shaped and articulated, full of childish nightmares, with the two Trios beautifully poised and expansive\\". The passage following the second Trio was perhaps a little hesitant, but this was a minor failing. It was especially pleasant to hear a movement that could sound abrasive played without anything rebarbative about it. Levine's performance of the Scherzo was just as good, although the string section of his Chicago Symphony Orchestra and RCA's engineering were both inferior to what Abbado's disc provided. Abbado's third movement was where his interpretation was at its most radical. Mahler had marked its opening as \\"Ruhevoll [peaceful], the long melodic line with its bell-like pizzicato imitative, Mahler told Bruno Walter, of 'recumbent stone figures, their arms crossed in eternal sleep on the tops of tombs'.\\" Klemperer had \\"ungraciously and impatiently\\" adopted a tempo of crotchet = 72; Kubelik, a \\"limpid\\" crotchet = 56; Szell an \\"innig [intimate] and grave\\" crotchet = 52: Abbado began at crotchet = 40, in flagrant defiance of Mahler's wishes. Moreover, when, at Figure 2, Mahler stipulated that the tempo be changed from poco adagio to viel langsamer [much slower], Abbado actually accelerated from crotchet = 40 to crotchet = 46. There was no denying, however, that Abbado's handling of the movement was \\"affecting\\". The Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, accustomed to the idiom of Bruckner, were able to cope with Abbado's pacing as if there was nothing in the least strange about it. They sounded \\"quite sublime\\", and played \\"with the utmost purity and eloquence\\". In a particular passage after Figure 11, their strings were \\"breathtakingly beautiful, warm, pure and intense in a way that no other string section ... could hope to surpass.\\" The Vienna Musikverein's Grosser or Goldener Saal (Great or Golden Hall) Frederica von Stade's contribution to the fourth movement had both pluses and minuses. In her first few notes she seemed a little out of breath, and some of her staccati sounded contrived. But \\"the St Ursula phrase soars eloquently out, the voice has a true mezzo reach for the low B flats and the end, which Abbado conducts with an affecting quiet, has, as Mahler requests, a sweet, secretive intimacy.\\" The audio quality of Deutsche Grammophon's disc was first class, with the woodwinds in particular recorded exquisitely. Kubelik's version had a \\"mood of pastoral gaiety and childlike wonder\\", and Szell's album was a low-risk option for someone wanting to own just a single version of the work. Abbado's LP was for collectors interested in how a conductor could turn a piece of music into something very different from what its composer had imagined and make it fascinatingly new. Eric Salzman reviewed the album on LP in Stereo Review in November 1978. Despite the advocacy of acolytes such as Bruno Walter, he wrote, Vienna had been slow to recognize that Gustav Mahler was on the same exalted level as Anton Bruckner.Leonard Bernstein had helped to open the city's ears to Mahler's genius, and Claudio Abbado, a former prot√©g√© of Bernstein's, was following in his footsteps. His reading of the Fourth Symphony explored a spectrum of sound and emotion that recalled Bernstein's way with Mahler without ever quite equalling Bernstein's extravagance. He captured \\"[Mahler's] long line with a sureness, delicacy and glow of feeling that is most moving\\". The Vienna MusikvereinNone of Mahler's other symphonies was more Viennese in spirit than the Fourth, and the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra was altogether at home in its radiant happiness. Their playing was \\"consistently wonderful without ever being lost in a welter of details\\". Frederica von Stade's performance of the final movement's Wunderhorn song did not spoil its innocent simplicity with unwarranted sophistication. The album as a whole was a genial, endearing addition to Mahler's discography. There had been a time when his music had been thought too difficult for anyone but a few specialists. The charm and accessibility of Abbado's disc made it easy to imagine that the composer's popularity would continue to grow, in Vienna as elsewhere.Salzman, Eric: Stereo Review, November 1978, p. 124 Richard Osborne revisited the album in Gramophone in November 1984, when it had been issued on a \\"luminously clear\\" CD. Its promotion to the superior format had made him listen to it with new ears. \\"Much more than on LP\\", he wrote, he was \\"aware of the brilliance of Mahler's scoring and of the VPO's re-creation of it. There is also much pleasure to be derived from the rapture of the Viennese strings in the slow movement and the boyish freshness and charm of Frederica von Stade in the fourth movement.\\" This said, he still found some of Claudio Abbado's conducting questionable, and a recently released rival CD of the symphony conducted by Klaus Tennstedt was probably a better buy.Osborne, Richard: Gramophone, November 1984, pp. 605-606 =Accolade= Stereo Review classed the album as a \\"Recording of Special Merit\\".

A multi-layer site, it has yielded some Acheulean and Mousterian stone tools, burials from the Late Bronze to the Iron ages, and several settlements and burials from the Classical Antiquity and Middle Ages. Of particular importance is a substantial complex of what once were religious buildings, dated to the 2nd‚Äì1st century BC, and inscribed on the list of the Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Significance. The Dedoplis Mindori plain is adjoined by a group of mounds, known as Aradetis Orgora, where archaeological finds span several periods of local culture sequence, from the Chalcolithic to the Early Middle Ages.  Overview  Dedoplis Mindori is a gently sloping plain at the confluence of eastern and western Prone, tributaries of the Kura, occupying the area of approximately 25 sq. km, some 3 km west of the village of Aradeti, Kareli Municipality. At its southern edge, where the river Ptsa joins the Kura near the village of Doghlauri, there is Aradetis Orgora, a group of three mounds, the dominant of which is known as Dedoplis Gora (\\"the queen's hill\\") and raises to 34 m above the river. A series of archaeological reconnaissance surveys explored both the plain and mounds in the 1950s and 1960s, but systematic archaeological study of the area was undertaken under the direction of Iulon Gagoshidze from 1972 to 1982. The excavations revealed an extensive complex of religious buildings at Dedoplis Mindori and a palace complex at Dedoplis Gora. Digs at Aradetis Orgora are ongoing, as part of the Georgian‚ÄìItalian Shida Kartli Archaeological Project, a collaboration of the Georgian National Museum and Ca' Foscari University of Venice launched in 2009. The Dedoplis Mindori sanctuary is unknown from written history. According to its excavator, Iulon Gagoshidze, it might have served as one of the principal pre-Christian shrines, and probably a royal one, of the ancient kingdom of Kartli, known to the Classical world as Iberia. The temples are dated by archaeologists to the 2nd‚Äì1st century BC. In the later 1st century AD, the complex was destroyed by fire. This dating is supported by combined archaeological evidence from a palace complex at nearby Dedoplis Gora: pottery, imported bronze-ware from the Roman Empire, and the radiocarbon analysis of grain stores. Arrowheads found in the destruction deposits suggest the fire was the result of a military conflict.  Layout  The middle portion of the Dedoplis Mindori plain is occupied by a complex of religious buildings, with the total area of 4 ha (225 √ó 180 m). The complex consists of eight temples, two gateways, dwellings, and other accessory structures, built simultaneously according to a well-designed uniform rectangular plan. The buildings, oriented south-north, surround a central square courtyard, measuring 105 √ó 103 m. They had mudbrick walls, with cobblestone socles and, with the exception of the main temple, were roofed with terracotta tiles. Wooden columns of the temples and gateways were crowned with sandstone capitals, adorned with elaborate carvings. The main temple is located at the southern end of the complex. With a columned hall as a central architectural element, its design is inspired by an Achaemenid architectural tradition. Its large open columned portico and square cella are surrounded by an ambulatory on three sides. At the north end of the building there is a two- column portico with a balcony. The cella, with the area of 300 sq. m, housed an altar under a cupola, supported by four columns; its mudbrick podium has survived. The walls of the temple had been plastered and adorned with murals. A smaller temple of similar design lies at the northern edge of the courtyard, with an ambulatory and a tiled pitched roof, which gives it a \\"Hellenistic\\" appearance. Six more, architecturally simpler places of worship are nearby, each having an open portico connected to a square cella with a doorway. The religious buildings are surrounded by the contemporaneous dwellings, probably for those who served at the sanctuary. Further 400 m north-west, there are remnants of a settlement of construction workers and craftsmen as well as a clay pit, with a number of discarded and broken pottery.

Biography  Born in an assimilated Jewish family (the father was managing director of a factory for Meerschaum pipes), Lichtblau graduated in 1902 from the state school in the Schellinggasse in downtown Vienna, in which he later (1906-1914) should return as a teacher of furniture design. From 1902 to 1905 he studied at the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts in the master class of Otto Wagner. = Role in the development of the Bosnian style in architecture = Lichtblau in 1904 studied the ancient residential architecture throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina, seeking to create a modern style based on these indigenous forms. His work in Bosnia is one example of the Wagner School's contact with the architecture in Bosnia and Herzegovina. His drawings were published in 1907 in the journal Der Architekt. They depict groups of old houses under the Jajce Fortress. He was impressed by the cascading and cubist forms of the roofs, the simple but powerful shapes of the houses, modeled by light and fine valers of scale black, white and brown. Thanks to the Art Nouveau interpretation of the contents, in them the old architecture of Bosnia manifested its hidden and subtle artistic values, reaching the level at which the points of contact with modern architecture showed themselves. In another group of drawings, Lichtblau seeks to create houses or buildings for contemporary needs, contemporary forms and construction. Some drawings show an effort to create a typical house that would take the form of an old residential architecture, some again represent the example of a representative house - villas for Bosnia - of course again designed and designed according to the same principle. The project for a house in Bosnia was created as early as 1904, so that date can be taken as the beginning of the development or search for a Bosnian style. Because in that Lichtblau project there are already significant components of the old Bosnian architecture - such as the elevated position of the house, the terraced access zone, the environment where the green is very significant is carefully cultivated, the house is enclosed by a high wall around a narrow courtyard. The house itself - the villa - shows that the architect respects the one-story elevation of the old houses; the house has latticework on the corner - with moldings - windows, a high pyramidal roof, white walls, size and proportion, elements and whole derived from old houses and built to new standards. Lichtblau goes a step further. He designed a villa in Vienna in full Bosnian style, giving this architectural expression European and universal legitimacy. Lichtbau designs the State Forest Directorate's project as a modern building with the characteristics of a centrally developed layout of a Bosnian apartment building. = Architect in Vienna = From 1910 to 1939 Lichtblau worked as a freelance architect in Vienna. From 1910 to 1920 he was also a freelancer of Wiener Werkst√§tte, later he was in a relationship with the Social Democrat-led community Rotes Wien, led a housing consultation, the consulting position for interior decoration (BEST), in the Karl-Marx-Hof and participated in communal housing. Lichtblau's most famous buildings include the so-called \\"chocolate house\\" in Vienna-Hietzing, a part of the Paul- Speiser-Hof and a double dwelling in the Vienna Werkbundsiedlung due to its fa√ßade design with dark brown majolica. = Exile in the USA = Lichtblau had to emigrate in 1939, he reached the United States from Britain and became a respected teacher at the Rhode Island School of Design. = Memory = In 1990, in Donaustadt (22nd district) in Vienna, the Lichtblaustra√üe was named after him, in Vienna Margareten (5th district) there is an Ernst-Lichtblau- Park.

Urbanovich worked as a machinist in Riga and was conscripted into the railway troops of the Imperial Russian Army during World War I, but was discharged after being gassed. He joined the Red Army during the Russian Civil War, resuming his service in the railway troops. Between the wars, Urbanovich rose to command positions in railway units of the OGPU Troops before holding staff positions in the NKVD Border Guards. After Operation Barbarossa began, he became commander of the 257th Rifle Division, but was relieved of command after it was surrounded on the Northwestern Front. Urbanovich briefly held regimental command and a staff position before taking command of the 252nd Rifle Division at the beginning of 1942. He led the 252nd and then the 186th Rifle Division in the Battles of Rzhev, and in mid-1943 was promoted to command the 41st Rifle Corps, which he led for the rest of the war in its westward advance.

With the 14th Army of the Southwestern Front, he served with the armored train in fighting near Kazatin and Uman during the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War. Urbanovich entered the 27th Oryol Infantry and Machine Gun Commanders' Courses in August and after completing them in November was appointed a platoon instructor in the 2nd Reserve Machine Gun Battalion. From January 1921 he served first as a machine gun platoon commander, then as assistant chief and chief of the machine gun detachment of the 2nd Regiment of the Cheka. With the Cheka unit, he fought in the suppression of the Tambov Rebellion, receiving the Order of the Red Banner in 1923 for his actions.  Interwar period  Urbanovich transferred to the 25th Separate Road Transport Battalion of the Cheka in November 1921, temporarily serving as a company commander. The battalion was reorganized as the 5th Volga Railway Regiment in June 1922, and as a result he became a platoon commander and then a battalion adjutant. He transferred to the 5th Nizhegorod Battalion of the OGPU Troops in January 1923, serving as a platoon commander, and from June of that year temporarily served as assistant commander of the battalion for personnel. Released for study in May 1924, he became a student at the Frunze Military Academy in September after passing the entrance exam. After his graduation from the academy, Urbanovich became an instructor and chief of the main faculty of the Higher Border School of the OGPU in July 1928. From November 1931 he served as temporary chief of the training department of the 1st Voroshilov Border Guard and OGPU Troops School, becoming chief of staff of the school in December of that year.

He was soon promoted to major general. After the division finished its formation, it was sent to Bologoye, joining the 34th Army of the Reserve Front (transferred to the Northwestern Front on 6 August) on arrival and participated in the Staraya Russa counterattack. The army was forced to retreat to the Lovat River by the counterattack of German reserves. During the withdrawal, the division was part of the rearguard and kept open the retreat of the main forces of the army. The division was surrounded near Lake Ilmen and after it broke out Urbanovich was relieved of command in the second half of September for \\"unsuccessful actions.\\" He was demoted to command the 295th Rifle Regiment of the 183rd Rifle Division of the 27th Army of the Northwestern Front.

It remained there for four months in the Rzhev salient in semi-encirclement, supplied only by a small corridor in the Nesterovo area. Between 2 and 5 July German forces cut off the 39th Army in Operation Seydlitz with converging attacks on Nesterovo from Bely and Karskaya. Under these conditions, Urbanovich managed to withdrawal the division from the encirclement, showing \\"firmness in command\\" and \\"personal courage\\", according to evaluation by superiors. Urbanovich was appointed commander of the 186th Rifle Division of the front's 22nd Army on 30 August. The 186th defended positions on the north bank of the Molodoy Tud, and was transferred to the 39th Army on 5 October.

He was awarded the Order of the Red Banner on 8 April 1943 for the division's capture of Olenino during the Rzhev‚ÄìVyazma Offensive in late February and early March of that year. The 186th was withdrawn to front reserve on 7 March and then to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command, being relocated to Plavsk, joining the 3rd Army of the Bryansk Front in May. Urbanovich was promoted to command the 41st Rifle Corps of the 3rd Army on 5 July, leading the corps for the rest of the war; he was promoted to lieutenant general on 2 November 1944. 3rd Army commander Alexander Gorbatov repeatedly evaluated him as a \\"skilled organizer and battlefield leader\\" during this period. He led the corps in Operation Kutuzov, the Bryansk Offensive, the Rogachev-Zhlobin Offensive, the Bobruysk Offensive, the Minsk Offensive, the Belostok Offensive, the Mlawa-Elbing Offensive, and the East Prussian Offensive as part of the Bryansk Front, the Central Front, and the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Belorussian Fronts. During this period, the corps participated in the capture of Oryol, Kostyukovichi, Rogachev, Bobruysk, Novogrudok, Belostok, Ostrolenka, Willenberg, and Heiligenbeil. It went on to fight in the Berlin Offensive in April 1945, entering the battle after the breakthrough of the German defensive line and participating in the reduction of the Halbe pocket. For his leadership in the latter, Urbanovich received the Order of Kutuzov, 1st class, on 29 May.  Postwar  After the end of the war, Urbanovich continued to command the 41st Rifle Corps in the Minsk (Belorussian from March 1946) Military District. He entered the Higher Academic Courses at the Voroshilov Higher Military Academy in May 1949, and upon graduation a year leader became commander of the 137th Rifle Corps of the Far Eastern Military District. Sent to the People's Republic of China in April 1953 as the senior military adviser to the commander of a People's Liberation Army military district, he became senior military adviser to the PLA deputy chief of the general staff for combat training. Upon his return to the Soviet Union in July 1957, Urbanovich was seconded to the General Staff for research work, and transferred to the reserve on 3 October 1960. He died in Moscow on 2 June 1977 and was buried at the Kuntsevo Cemetery.

Education  After moving to the United Kingdom in the late 1960s, Cayley went to secondary school in the south of England. He read for a degree in Chinese Studies at Durham University, leaving with a 2:1 in 1978.  Career  While still a graduate student and UK-based translator and poet, between the late 1970s and mid 1990s, Cayley began to experiment with using programs and algorithms, coded for newly-accessible personal computers, to manipulate and generate poetic texts. From 1986-88 Cayley worked as a curator in the Chinese Section of the British Library and, during the same period, founded Wellsweep, an independent micro-press devoted to literary translation from Chinese, chiefly poetry. One of Cayley's early experiments with hypertext and poetry, a late 1990s collaboration with Chinese poet Yang Lian, is discussed in 'Making waves in world literature,' chapter 6 of Jacob Edmond's Make it the same: poetry in the age of global media. Throughout his career, Cayley has created and developed a number of original formal techniques for the composition and display of digital language art: poetically motivated Markov-chain text generation, dynamic text, self-altering text, transliteral morphing, ambient poetry, etc. In 2017, his lifelong contributions to the theory and practice of digital language art earned him the Electronic Literature Organization Marjorie C. Luesebrink Career Achievement Award. There are a number of discussions of both Cayley's theoretical contributions and certain of his works in Scott Rettberg's Electronic Literature. Katherine Hayles discusses Cayley's riverIsland in 'The Time of Digital Poetry: From Object to Event,' and Tong- King Lee devotes a large part of chapter 7 in his co-authored book, Translation and translanguaging to Cayley's translation. In 2009, Cayley launched, with long-term collaborator, Daniel C. Howe, The Readers Project, 'an aesthetically-oriented system of software agents, designed to explore the culture of human reading.' This project is extensively discussed in Manuel Portela's Scripting Reading Motions. Cayley's most recent work explores transactive synthetic language and led to his creation of a skill for the Amazon Echo, The Listeners.
