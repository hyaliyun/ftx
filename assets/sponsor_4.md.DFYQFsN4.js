In the 1970s the towns of Instow and Arromanches instigated an arrangement whereby families visited each other's town every other year staying with a host family.

The site is occupied by 11 Amphibious Trials and Training Squadron, part of 1 Assault Group Royal Marines, which carries out training for operations which include disembarking from landing craft, wading across a water gap of up to 1.5m (4 ft 6 inches) in depth, an activity known as fording, and arriving at a beachhead. The site is also used for trialling new landing craft: the Royal Marines have been moving away from the use of flat-bottomed landing craft or DUKWs to armed powerboats.

Plot summary A Feydeau-style farce in which a burglar who is in the act of burgling the house is interrupted by the arrival of a couple - who are in fact having an affair. The farcical complications that ensue also involve the arrival of the burglar's wife. In the end, as they are all arguing among themselves, yet another burglar arrives to burgle the flat. The play begins with a burglar breaking into a luxury flat. His wife phones him and he is annoyed. As he hangs up, the owner of the house and a woman turn up. The burglar hides inside a grandfather clock but knocks the pendulum, leading the owner and the woman to think that the clock has struck 1:00am. The owner and the woman are having an affair. The owner complains that his wife is so old fashioned and the woman complains that her husband is easily persuaded. The burglar's wife phones and the owner answers. The burglar's wife thinks she is talking to her husband and that he is having an affair. The owner explains that he isn't her husband and believes that because the husband was watching them, he is a private detective, hired by his wife to see if he was having an affair. This leads the burglar's wife to think that the owner of the house's wife and her husband are having an affair. The owner tells her to phone the house where he thinks his wife is. The woman believes that the 'detective' has phoned the police already and tells the owner to shoot himself. As he is about to pull the trigger, the clock strikes 12:30. This confuses the owner and the woman as they believe the clock is going backwards. The burglar emerges from the clock, having been hit repeatedly by the pendulum. The owner and the woman think they have found the 'detective' and plan to shoot him. The burglar convinces them not to, but instead, get him drunk. Suddenly, the burglar steals the gun from the owner and threatens him. He reveals he is a burglar. This interests the woman as she has an obsession with \\"Celebrated Crimes and Thefts.\\" The burglar proves he is a leading member of a notorious gang. Suddenly, the owner's wife, Anna, turns up. The owner takes the gun and forces the burglar to pretend to be the woman's husband. Anna comes in and tells them she had a telephone call from a woman (the burglar's wife) who said she was having an affair with her husband. The owner introduces the burglar and his \\"wife\\" and Anna invites them to stay the night. The spiteful burglar agrees, much to the disdain of the owner and the woman. The woman and Anna go to sort out a room. The owner forces the burglar at gunpoint to steal, because the burglar said that they exploited burglars. The burglar's real wife turns up and, after a brief conversation, believes that her husband has two wives. Anna appears and the owner poorly explains why the burglar has two wives. The owner spitefully tells the real wife to come and meet the other \\"wife\\". After they have left, a man, Antonio, appears, asking Anna if she is alone. They are having an affair too. Antonio believes Anna set everything up so that she could cancel their date to have an affair with someone else. At this point, the burglar returns to collect his bag. Antonio thinks the burglar and Anna are having an affair and locks them in. Anna explains but Antonio loses the key. Suddenly, the \\"wives\\" and owner return. The burglar helps Antonio hide in the clock. The burglar's real wife wants to leave, but there is no key. The burglar picks the lock. As he does so, the clock strikes 1:00am. Antonio emerges, having also been hit by the pendulum. The woman and Antonio are surprised to see each other as they are married. The burglar attempts to explain things, but the others shut him up so he doesn't reveal the affairs, saying it's all one big misunderstanding. The burglar and his wife escape. The others try and catch them. As they do, another burglar arrives. The others, thinking the first burglar has returned to collect his loot, grab the second burglar. They tell him it's all one big misunderstanding and say they will explain. As they all ramble on with their lies, the second burglar escapes.Mitchell 1999, pp. 61‚Äì62 Translations Ed Emery has carried out an English translation (\\"The Good that a Burglar Can Bring\\").Online English translation at: http://www.geocities.ws/dariofoarchive/burglar.html Joe Farrell has carried out an English adaptation (\\"The Virtuous Burglar\\").Fo, Dario.

The treaties ended a protracted period of warfare which had lasted more than 75 years and encompassed six wars between the Mi'kmaq people and the British. The Burying the Hatchet Ceremonies and the treaties that they commemorated created an enduring peace and a commitment to obey the rule of law. Many of British commitments were not delivered on, despite the intentions of the British dignitaries who attended the ceremony and helped draft the treaty, such as the right afforded to the Mi'kmaq for becoming British subjects. The treaties were enshrined into the Canadian Constitution in 1982, and there have since been numerous judicial decisions that have upheld them in the Canadian Supreme Court, the most recognized being the Donald Marshall case. Nova Scotians celebrate the Treaties of 1760-61 every year on Treaty Day (October 1).  Historical context  Jonathan Belcher by John Singleton Copley. Belcher and the Nova Scotia Council created the Halifax Treaties of 1760-61 Pierre Maillard, Negotiator for the Mi'kmaq, plaque at Saint Mary's Church, Halifax, Nova Scotia; he is reported to be buried on the grounds of St. Paul's Church (Halifax)) The northeastern region of North America encompassing New England and Acadia increasingly became an area of conflict between the French and British Empires, and there was a long history of the Wabanaki Confederacy (which included the Mi'kmaq) killing British colonists along the border of New England and Acadia in Maine. Several Governors of the Massachusetts Bay Colony attempted to prevent these French and Wabanaki massacres by issuing a bounty for the scalps of men of the Wabanaki Confederacy.A particular history of the five years French and Indian War in New England ... By Samuel Gardner Drake, William Shirley. p. 134 During Father Le Loutre's War, Edward Cornwallis followed that example after the Raid on Dartmouth (1749) when he attempted to protect the first British settlers in Nova Scotia from being scalped by putting a bounty on the Mi'kmaq (1749). The final period of this conflict was the French and Indian War, when French officers, Mi'kmaq, and Acadians carried out military strikes against the New Englanders, particularly after the deportation of the Acadians and the bounty proclamation of 1756. The Mi'kmaq and their French allies conducted the Northeastern Coast Campaign (1755) in Maine and extended this campaign into Nova Scotia, attacking civilians during the raids on Lunenburg. The British captured Louisbourg in 1758 and battled Quebec in 1759 and Montreal in 1760, and the French imperial power was destroyed in North America. With the loss of their French ally, the Mi'kmaq recognized the need for a new relationship with the British colonists. There were various treaties signed with other tribes of the Mi'kmaq and Maliseet before the formal burying the hatchet ceremony. On 11 February 1760, two tribes of the Passamaquoddy and Saint John River came to Halifax with Colonel Arbuthnot and appeared before council, renewing the treaty of 1725 and giving hostages for their good behavior. On Feb 13, a treaty was ratified with Roger Morris and one of the Mi'kmaq chiefs.(Atkins, p. 64) On 10 March 1760, Mi'kmaq chiefs Paul Laret, Michael Austine, and Calude Renie made a treaty.(Atkins, p. 65) On 15 October 1761, Jannesvil Peitougashwas (Pictock and Malogomish) made a treaty. French priest Pierre Maillard accepted an invitation from Nova Scotia Governor Charles Lawrence to travel to Halifax and assist in negotiating with the Mi'kmaq peoples. He also received permission to maintain an oratory at a Halifax battery, where he held Catholic services for Acadians and Mi'kmaqs in the area.These services were held \\"with great freedom\\" according to Maillard's report. Dictionary In his official capacity, Maillard was able to persuade most of the tribal chiefs to sign peace treaties with the British in Halifax.  The Ceremony  Richard Bulkeley On June 25, 1761,Some accounts give the date as 8 July 1761 a \\"Burying of the Hatchet Ceremony\\" was held at Governor Jonathan Belcher's garden on present-day Spring Garden Road, Halifax in front of the Court House. Representing the colony were Belcher and four members of the Nova Scotia Council: Richard Bulkeley, John Collier, Joseph Gerrish, and Alexander Grant.Alexander Grant, Esq. of London who moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1760. He apparently received an appointment as Indian Commerce Contractor for Canada and as Agent Victualer to His Majesty's Ships at Halifax. I have also found a vague reference to him being a member of His Majesty's Council of Nova Scotia from which point he was referred to as the Hon. Alexander Grant Esq. Alexander returned to London about 1766. Also present were Admiral Lord Colville, commander-in-chief of British naval forces in North America, Major-General John Henry Bastide, the chief engineer in Nova Scotia and Colonel William Forster, the commander of Nova Scotia's army regiments. These three men were accompanied by a detachment of soldiers.Wicken, p. 216 There were at least four Mi'kmaq chiefs that signed the treaty: Jeannot Peguidalonet (representing Cape Breton), Claude Atouach (Shediac), Joseph Sabecholouet (Miramichi), and Aikon Ashabuc (Pokemouche). Representatives from other villages were also present at the treaty signing. The occasion was one of \\"great pomp and ceremony\\". The two parties faced each other near a British flag. French priest Pierre Maillard was in the middle acting as the interpreter. Belcher promised the crown would protect the Mi'kmaq from unscrupulous traders, protect their religion and not interfere with Catholic missionaries living among them. Belcher gave presents to each chief along with medals that were passed down through generations as testimony to the words that bound their people to uphold the peace. Both Belcher and the chiefs then moved to the flag post, where Belcher and the chiefs formally buried the hatchet. One of the Mi'kmaq Chiefs declared that \\"he now buried the hatchet on behalf of himself and his whole tribe, a token of their submission and of their having made peace.\\"Thomas Radall. Halifax: Warden of the North. p. 62 The Chief of the Cape Breton Mi'kmaq's declared: \\"As long as the Sun and the Moon shall endure, as long as the Earth on which I dwell shall exist in the same State as you this day, with the Laws of your Government, faithful and obedient to the Crown\\".Stephen Patterson. Atlantic Canada to Confederation. p. 150 At the same time the hatchet was being buried, the Chiefs went through the ceremony of washing the paint from their bodies in token of hostilities being ended. The whole ceremony was concluded by all present drinking to the king's health. The cornerstone of the Halifax Provincial Court (Spring Garden Road) now stands beside the spot of the burial, a symbol of peace and the rule of law.Atkins, History of Halifax. p. 66; Radall,  Aftermath  The Halifax Treaties effectively established peace between the Mi'kmaq and the British by both committing to uphold the rule of law. Historians disagree about whether or not the Treaties reflect that the Mi'kmaq surrendered or not to the British. Daniel N. Paul notes that the wording of the document ascribed to the Chiefs uses language and knowledge of European conventions that would be incomprehensible or unknown to the Mi'kmaq.

He competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics, posting France's best result in men's √©p√©e. Career =Early years= Borel was born in Guadeloupe, overseas France. When he had to choose an extracurricular activity at the age of ten, he hesitated between fencing and gwo ka, a genre of Guadeloupe folk music. He chose the former because the club was close to his school and several of his friends already fenced. Five-time Olympic medallist Laura Flessel, also from Guadeloupe, was also a major inspiration for him. He learnt √©p√©e under coaches Rudy Plicoste and Barbara Paulin. At the age of fifteen he was noticed by France's head coach J√©r√¥me Roussat, who offered him a spot at the national junior training centre in Reims, Metropolitan France. Borel's parents refused, because they wanted him to finish high school before focussing on sport. He was allowed to go after he obtained his baccalaur√©at in 2007 and began training with the best junior fencers alongside to his physical therapy studies. That year he was selected into the French national junior team that won a silver medal at the Junior European Championships in Prague. The next season, he earned a silver medal at the Herakled Cup in Budapest and won the Uhlmann Cup in Laupheim, two events of the Junior World Cup. He also became junior national champion. =Senior career= In 2009 Borel gave up his physical therapy studies, which were too demanding for a high-performance athlete, and switched to physical education at INSEP, where he trained with the senior national team. He took part in the 2009 Summer Universiade, but did not earn any medal. Two quarter- finals finishes in the 2010‚Äì11 season had him selected into the senior national team for the first time. At the 2011 European Championships in Sheffield he reached the table of 16, defeating 2010 World silver medallist and teammate Gauthier Grumier along the way, but he yielded to Germany's J√∂rg Fiedler and finished 11th. In the team event France saw off Switzerland, Ukraine and finally Hungary to earn a gold medal. After this result Borel transferred from the Cercle d'Escrime de Ch√¢lons to the Levallois Sporting Club, where he joined teammates Ulrich Robeiri and Gauthier Grumier. At the 2011 World Championships in Catania Borel reached again the table of 16, before being stopped by Korea's Park Kyoung-doo. In the team event France cruised to the quarter-finals, then defeated Germany, South Korea and Hungary to post their sixth World title in a row. Borel finished the season World No.14, a career best . In the 2011‚Äì12 season Borel climbed his first World Cup podium with a bronze medal in Legnano. He qualified to the 2012 Summer Olympics as one of the two top-ranked Europeans. As men's team √©p√©e did not feature on the Olympic programme, World Championships were held separately in April. France defeated Russia, then prevailed by a single hit over Italy in the semi-finals. They failed to establish a new record of seven straight World titles after a surprise 37‚Äì44 defeat against the United States and had to settle for silver. For his Olympic d√©but Borel defeated Ukraine's Dmytro Karyuchenko and Switzerland's Fabian Kauter. In the quarter-finals he met Norway's Bartosz Piasecki and took an early 6‚Äì2 lead, but failed to press his advantage and was finally defeated 14‚Äì15 by Piasecki, who eventually won the silver medal. After the Games Borel was dropped from the national team and had two dry seasons, although he was France's flagbearer at the 2013 University Games. He bounced back in the 2014‚Äì15 season with a silver medal at the Heidenheim World Cup. He competed for France at the 2016 Olympics, where he was part of the French team that won the team gold medal. Because of this, he was made a knight of the Legion of Honour. He won the individual gold at the 2016 and 2017 European Fencing Championships.

The character first appeared on Russell's Twitter feed as a sketch and has gone on to be included in a series of webcomics, two published compilations and several issues of Dark Horse Presents. Publication history and origins Russell, who writes regular movie reviews for The Oregonian, a daily newspaper in Portland, created the Sabertooth Vampire in January 2011 while waiting for a preview screening of The Mechanic to begin. He drew a sketch of a pint-sized vampire with oversized teeth and a Napoleon complex. He later posted the image on his Twitter feed with the caption \\"My attempt to find a new angle for the young- adult vampire-fiction market.\\" Dylan Meconis, a Portland-based illustrator, encouraged Russell to further develop the character. This, coupled with a favorable response from Russell's readers, led him to create a series of black and white webcomics that were later assembled into two print collections. The series has, thus far, been released in periodic \\"seasons\\" ala a television program. The first season was compiled in a collection and released in early 2011. A follow-up, titled The Sabertooth Vampire: Unleashed, appeared that October and included comics from season two of the series. Russell announced a third season, tentatively scheduled for early 2013, at an event in Portland in December 2012. It was published in the summer of 2016. During the spring and summer of 2012, issues 12, 14 and 15 of Dark Horse Presents included Sabertooth Vampire comic strips, one of which featured an encounter between the titular character and Hellboy, the popular comic book hero. The strips marked the first appearance of the character in color, compliments of Portland cartoonist Bill Mudron. Fictional character biography The true origins of the Sabertooth Vampire are unknown but the series offers two theories. In one strip, the character evolves from a sabertooth caveman and becomes the Sabertooth Vampire after touching the mysterious monolith featured in the opening scene of 2001: A Space Odyssey. In another strip titled \\"Secret Origins of the Sabertooth Vampire,' he's portrayed as the son of two modern- day vampires. His father is presented as a normal vampire with conventional fangs but his mother possesses much longer ones ala a sabertooth tiger, which the character was also born with. Like more prototypical vampires, the Sabertooth Vampire requires human blood to survive, appears invisible in mirrors and can turn into a bat but he remains impervious to sunlight and ages much like a human being. His childhood was fraught with traumatic experiences, which included awkward attempts at courtship, high school sports and theatrical productions as revealed in \\"I Was a Teenaged Sabertooth Vampire.\\" Over the course of the series, the Sabertooth Vampire routinely finds himself heavily burdened by his short stature and the weight of his long, cumbersome fangs. Nevertheless, this hasn't prevented him from embarking on a series of misadventures that have included trips into outer space, failed attempts at romance, car chases, roller derbies and a starring role in a commercial for a cereal called \\"Saber O's.\\" He is often aided and rescued from various predicaments by Renfield, the character from Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula. The strip's second season concludes with a cliffhanger after the Sabertooth Vampire uses a spray called \\"Vamp Away\\" to turn into a human after becoming frustrated with his long fangs and inability to shave with a mirror. His transformation renders him a mortal but, unfortunately, one with humongous incisors. Unsatisfied with his new form, in the strip's final panel he begs a group of disdainful vampires to turn him back into a member of the undead. In issue # 14 of Dark Horse Presents, the Sabertooth Vampire encountered Hellboy, the popular comic book hero, in a strip titled \\"Hellboy vs. the Sabertooth Vampire.\\" Their conflict ended in a draw after the vampire's fangs became perpetually stuck in Hellboy's stone hand.

Robinson Cabin, is a recreational cabin on the eastern shore of Lake McDonald in Glacier National Park, Montana. The cabin was built around the year 1910, which was the same time that a number of other summer camps were built, and was also prior to the establishment of the park itself. Once the park was designated, the cabin has remained as a private inholding. History The Beck property was originally part of a homestead developed in the 1890s by Denis and Lydia Comeau, who had near the top of Lake McDonald. Denis Comeau was a sawyer in the winter. The Comeaus sold the parcel that would become the Beck camp to John Robinson in 1905. After their divorce a couple of years later, Denis Comeau left for British Columbia and Lydia subdivided more of her land. The cabin on the Robinson property was built about 1910, possibly by Edward Cruger, who built other similar cabins in the area. The cabin was unoccupied in the 1920s and 1930s, and as such, children from neighboring camps called it the \\"haunted cabin.\\" The National Park Service, which was buying properties on the lake for the park, did not acquire the Robinson property, and the heir of John Robinson sold it in 1941 to O.M. Junkind. It then passed to Alice Beck, who sold it to Eugene and Luella Fox in 1950. Fox descendants continue to own the property. Description The Beck Cabin is a 1-1/2 story peeled log cabin with a screened porch across the side facing the lake under the extended front gable.

These proteins have strong sequence and structural homology, particularly at their C-terminal end. The function is to promote their pathogenicity and virulence in host cells, though cell adhesion. YadA is found in three pathogenic species of Yersinia, Y. pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis, and Y. enterocolitica. The YadA domain is encoded for by a virulence plasmid in Yersinia, which encodes a type-III secretion (T3S) system consisting of the Ysc injectisome and the Yop effectors. Function Essentially, the main function of the YadA domain is to help cell adhesion and to increase virulence. YadA is a collagen-binding outer membrane protein. It forms the fibrillar matrix on the bacterial cell surface. This aids cell attachment and helps the bacteria invade eukaryotic cells. Additionally, by forming the fibrillar matrix, the YadA domain protects the bacteria by facilitating agglutination resistance, serum resistance, complement inactivation and phagocytosis resistance. The importance of adhesins to YadA function and Yersinia survival is huge. Attachment further allows more interactions and increase of biofilm formation to aid bacterial colonization. In Yersinia, it helps initiate the infectious process in host cells and are critical virulence factors. Additionally, bacteria have the ability to regulate adhesin expression, meaning that when Yersinia no longer requires YadA, it can be turned off. Furthermore, YadA expression is mainly temperature regulated, at 37 degrees Celsius. It also has two molecular regulators: an activator, VirF and a repressor, YmoA. Substrate adhesion The YadA protein domain adheres to the following substrates: * epithelial cells * extracellular matrix * collagen * cellular fibronectin * laminin Protein domains in YadA = C terminal domain= The C-terminal domain consists of 120 amino acids which belong to a family of surface-exposed bacterial proteins. The YadA C-terminal domain has a particular function in translocating the trimeric N-terminal passenger domain to the exterior of the membrane and is also responsible for trimerisation. Structure =C-terminal domain structure= The C-terminal region is a transmembrane region which consists of 4 beta strands which form trimers in the outer membrane. The C-terminal contains 9 amino acids which alternate hydrophobic amino acids ending in F (Phenylalanine) or W (Tryptophan), this composes a targeting motif for the outer membrane of the Gram-negative cell membrane. This region is important for oligomerisation. The C-terminal domain helps to build the beta barrel pore in the outer membrane. =YadA protein structure= YadA is a homotrimeric outer membrane protein which forms part of the fibrillar matrix. Simplistically, this means the protein is made of three of the same subunits, on the outer surface of the membrane. The surface is entirely covered in the YadA lollipop structures. made of a short C-terminal membrane anchor, an 18 nm long coiled-coil stem and a 5 nm long N-terminal globular head structure consisting of a left-handed parallel beta roll. YadA is an example of an oligomeric coiled-coil adhesin (Oca). The Oca protein families are a subset of autotransporters, also known as the type Vc or trimeric autotransporters. Trimerization is thought to involve the coiled-coil stem and the C-terminal membrane anchor, which forms a 12-strand beta-barrelfrom the four transmembrane beta-strands of the three monomers. This beta-barrel would form a pore-like structure through which the N-terminal head and coiled helical domains of the three monomer chains exit to the cell surface. The YadA protein domain, is a form of trimeric autotransporter adhesins (TAAs). Each TAA must consist of a head, stalk and a beta-barrel membrane anchor. History YadA, an adhesin from Yersinia, was the first member of this family to be characterised. UspA2 from Moraxella was second. The Eib immunoglobulin-binding proteins from Escherichia coli were third, followed by the DsrA proteins of Haemophilus ducreyi, amongst others.

Since the opening in 2011, Robert Gardos practices at the Werner Schlager Academy in Schwechat, Austria. Career =Early career= Gardos was born on 16 January 1979 in Budapest, Hungary. He began playing table tennis in his hometown club Budapesti VSC where his father, G√°bor G√°rdos worked as a coach that time. In 1993 Gardos won the European Youth Championship in singles and in mixed doubles on the side of Mihaela Encea in the cadet category. At the age of 14, he switched his residence to Austria, however, he competed for Hungary until he was 18. In 1998, after a conflict with the Hungarian national team ‚Äì Gardos was left out from the team and could only compete in the singles event ‚Äì, he opted to play for Austria in the future, having already obtained the citizenship two years earlier. =Austrian years= ITTF World Tour 2017, German Open Gardos, who is right- handed, began competing for Austria after the three year international suspension for country changing was lifted. He had several success at Table Tennis European Championships, most notably winning the doubles event of the 2012 edition with Daniel Habeson. One year later the duo finished second in the same event having lost the final against Wang Zeng Yi and Tan Ruiwu. In singles, Gardos' best performance came in 2008 in St. Petersburg by finishing third. Gardos was also present at two Olympic Games in 2008 and 2012. At the 2008 Summer Olympics Gardos faced an early exit in the singles as he was beaten in the second round by Zoran Primorac, thus finished tied-33rd. In the team event, Austria (Robert Gardos, Chen Weixing, Werner Schlager) just missed out a medal as they fell short against South Korea (Oh Sang-Eun, Ryu Seung- Min, Yoon Jae-Young) in the bronze final by a scoreline 1‚Äì3. Gardos did not qualify for the 2012 Summer Olympics in singles, but the Austrian team with the same line-up was present at the Games. After an easy victory in the first round (Egypt, 3‚Äì0), the team faced eventual bronze medalist Germany and lost without winning a single match (0‚Äì3), thus finishing tied-fifth. In June 2015, he competed in the inaugural European Games, for Austria in table tennis, more specifically, Men's team with Stefan Fegerl and Daniel Habesohn. He earned a bronze medal. Gardos qualified for and competed in the 2017 World Table Tennis Championships, seeded at number 42. In the first round, he defeated Chew Zhe Yu of Singapore (4-2), before losing to Chinese player, and number 4 seed Zhang Jike, (2-4). Personal life His nickname is Robi.

He was a fur trapper and an interpreter for the United States government during its early contacts with the Menominee tribe. Early life It is often said that Richard Prickett was born about 1777. The 1830 Brown County, Michigan Territory federal census, however, shows him to be between the sges of 60 and 70 and it seems more likely that he was born in the late 1760. He was born in Fayette County, now Greene County, Pennsylvania. His parents were Josiah and Mary Elliott Prickett; his paternal grandfather was Abraham Prickett, a New Jersey Quaker who migrated to Maryland, then to Frederick County, Virginia, and finally to Fayette County, Pennsylvania. Richard‚Äôs older brother Josiah served in the American Revolution, at times as an Indian spy. At age 13, Richard was captured by Shawnee Indians on Bear Creek, northeast of Fort Pitt, in present-day Armstrong County, Pennsylvania and later taken to Ohio by the Stockbridge tribe. After a number of years, he was given to the Chippewa tribe and Prickett moved to Michilimackinac and worked in the fur trade for 20 years. In 1804/05 Prickett was employed by the Northwest Company at the Lac La Pluie post as an interpreter with a three year contract. Government interpreter From 1818 to 1834, Prickett was the government interpreter for the Indian Service with the Menominee tribe. Prickett spoke the Chippewa language but did not speak the Menominee language. He was able to interpret due to the fact that most Menominee chiefs also spoke Chippewa. In 1823, Prickett claimed a section of land on the west bank of the Fox River near Green Bay, Wisconsin. Although he himself was Roman Catholic, Prickett subscribed to and sent two of his children to the Episcopal seminary school at Green Bay. The headmaster at the school described him as \\"violent and abusive.\\" Prickett was the U.S. interpreter for Colonel Samuel C. Stambaugh, along with interpreters R.A. Forsyth, C.A. Grignon, and A.G. Ellis for the 1831 treaty with the Menominee tribe. When the Senate modified the treaty, he interpreted for the second one, in 1832. Prickett later worked for Colonel George Boyd, the U.S. Indian Agent at Green Bay, Wisconsin as an interpreter. He was said to have married a Chippewa and later a Menominee. He also worked as a fur trapper. When he died in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, in 1847, he was said to be the wealthiest man on the reservation. His mixed-breed descendants still lived in Michigan.

He was a founder member of the Senefelder Club and served as its honorary secretary from 1910 to 1916. While there he met his future wife, Ethel L√©ontine Gabain, with whom he had two sons. He is most notable for being the oldest recipient of any Olympic medal, having been awarded a silver medal for Painting and Engraving at the 1948 London Summer Olympiad, and also for being the last person to win said silver medal. Personal life John Copley and wife Ethel, c.1930s Copley was born in Manchester in 1875. He studied art at the Manchester School of Art and the Royal Academy. He spent ten years in Italy before moving to London. In 1909 Copley and Joseph Pennell started the Senefelder Club to publicise and promote lithography as an artistic medium. Copley was honorary secretary of the club until 1916. During this time he met the French-English artist Ethel L√©ontine Gabain and the couple married in June 1913. John and Ethel lived in Kent for a time at The Yews in Longfield. They had two children, Peter and Christopher. Peter went on to have a successful and lengthy career as an actor.Anthony Hayward \\"Peter Copley: Prolific character actor whose career lasted more than 70 years\\", The Independent, 29 December 2008. The family moved to 10 Hampstead Square, NW3, where they created a studio in which the couple could work together. They moved to Alassio, Italy, where they would stay for two and a half years before moving back to London. During World War II he worked as an official war artist. Ethel died on 30 January 1950 at the age of 66. Less than six months later, on 17 July 1950, John also died. Career Copley was influenced by Ford Madox Brown. He became interested in lithography in 1906 and initially worked in colour before exclusively working in black and white. One of his works claimed a prize at Chicago Art Institute's First International Exhibition of Lithographs. In 1947 Copley was honoured as the president of the Royal Society of British Artists. =Olympic success= Copley submitted an engraving entitled \\"Polo Players\\" to the art competitions of the 1948 Summer Olympic Games in London. He won the silver medal in the Mixed Painting, Engravings And Etchings category, finishing second behind French artist Albert Decaris. At the time of the competition Copley was 73 years of age, making him the oldest ever Olympic medal winner. The arts competitions are no longer recognised by the International Olympic Committee; 72-year-old Swedish shooter Oscar Swahn is recorded as the oldest sporting medal winner. The Fine Art Society celebrated Copley's Olympic success at the London Original Print Fair in April 2012. A collection of his works was on display throughout the event.

His professional career began in 1994 after graduating from Southern University, and as of 2014‚Äì15 he plays for Club Olimpo in Argentina. Early life A native of New York City, Scales and his family moved four different times within the metropolitan area before he was 15 years old. They relocated, permanently, to Dayton, Ohio at that time, and it was in Ohio that he discovered how much he enjoyed playing basketball. Due to low test scores, Scales did not get recruited out of high school. Only Southern University took a calculated risk in recruiting him, although he was forced to sit out his freshman season due to Proposition 48 rules. College In his three years of eligibility between 1991‚Äì92 and 1993‚Äì94, Scales had a standout career. He led the Southern Jaguars to the 1993 NCAA Tournament as a junior. As a #13 seed, they upset the heavily favored #4 seed Georgia Tech 93‚Äì78 behind Scales' 27 points and 18 rebounds. They lost in the next round, however. As a senior, he finished in the top 5 in the nation for both scoring average and rebounding average. At one point during that season he was number one in both statistical categories and could have joined Kurt Thomas, Hank Gathers and Xavier McDaniel as the only players in Division I history to have led the nation in both categories in the same season. On February 7, 1994, Scales grabbed 32 rebounds in a game against Grambling State, which is tied for the third-highest total in the post-1973 basketball era. At the end of his senior year he was named the Southwestern Athletic Conference Player of the Year. Professional Scales went unselected in the 1994 NBA Draft. He has since carved out a professional career in various countries, including Argentina (Alianza Viedma, A. Espanola, MH Basket, San Lorenzo de Almagro), Australia (Canberra Cannons), and Chile. He eventually acquired dual citizenship in Argentina where he continues to play today.

The Detached Mole, with the rest of harbour, is just north of the east entrance to the Strait of Gibraltar and was the site of the Detached Mole Battery. In addition to the role the breakwater plays in the defence of and access to the harbour, the Detached Mole provides berths for ships. The area adjacent to the mole is also a source of recreational and research opportunities, with dive sites at the wrecks of sunken ships. History The Detached Mole at Gibraltar Harbour, is one of a trio of breakwaters that provides protection to the harbour, in addition to the protection resulting from the presence of the Rock of Gibraltar itself on the east side of the harbour. The Detached Mole is positioned at the western aspect of the middle section of the harbour, which is located just north of the east entrance to the Strait of Gibraltar. The Detached Mole is 800 metres in length. Yachting facilities, including the Queensway Quay Marina, are also in the middle section of the harbour. The marina is privately owned and contains 160 berths for yachts. That section of the harbour is also home to Cormorant Camber and the Coaling Island quay. The south end of the Detached Mole, its \\"B\\" Head, is the site of the Gibraltar Detached Mole (\\"B\\" Head) Lighthouse.

The north end of the Detached Mole, its \\"C\\" Head, is the site of the Gibraltar Detached Mole (\\"C\\" Head) Lighthouse. The light characteristic is a quick, flashing green light, with a range of . The south entrance to Gibraltar Harbour, between the \\"A\\" Head of the South Mole and the \\"B\\" Head of the Detached Mole, is controlled by the Queen's Harbourmaster. Commercial boats typically use the north entrance to the harbour, between the \\"C\\" Head of the Detached Mole and the \\"D\\" Head of the Western Arm of the North Mole. Berths utilised by U.S. Navy ships on the Detached Mole include Piers 51 and 52. The Detached Mole was constructed of concrete blocks, each weighing 28 tons. The wall was built upon a foundation of rubble stone that was first deposited by barges and then leveled by divers before the placement of the concrete blocks. The Detached Mole was begun before 1888 and completed in 1901. It is of more recent vintage than the South Mole which was first constructed in the early seventeenth century (1620) as the New Mole, to distinguish it from the Old Mole. The North Mole, formerly known as the Commercial Mole, was a late nineteenth and early twentieth century extension of the Old Mole (begun in 1618) and its extension, the Devil's Tonque (constructed 1779-1783). In 1888, the sank off the Detached Mole after several collisions. The wreck has split in two, and the ship is upside down on the sea bed. The wreck of the steel-clad steamship is now a popular dive site. On 18 January 1942, the , an anti-submarine trawler, was sunk by an explosion in Gibraltar Harbour. The and were also severely damaged. It was eventually learned that the explosion on the Erin was the result of sabotage. A Spaniard who worked in the naval dockyard had packed a bomb inside one of the ship's depth charges. It is believed that the remains of the trawler were dragged through the north entrance to the harbour and dumped outside the Detached Mole. The \\"Inner and Outer\\" are two popular dive sites located off the Detached Mole. Both are felt to represent the remains of the HMT Erin. The first annual \\"Adopt a Wreck\\" Award was made in 2003 to the Gibraltar Museum's Underwater Research Unit and the Joint Services Dive Club for their work off Gibraltar's detached mole. It was in recognition of their research of the \\"Inner and Outer\\" sites.

Raymond Chudley to mark his retirement in 1996 as team leader of St Andrew's Church, Wickford, Essex. Over the centuries The Descent from the Cross or Deposition of Christ or Descent of Christ from the Cross, has been a common subject in Christian art. Famous examples from the old masters include those by Peter Paul Rubens, Rembrandt, Jacopo Pontormo and Rogier van der Weyden whose work influenced Folley's geometric composition. Folley's homage to Rogier van der Weyden‚Äôs masterpiece is a modern interpretation to ‚Äúinspire the viewer to contemplate the historical, human and mystical elements of the crucifixion‚Äù. It was rendered by the painter in response to Rev. Raymond Chudley request to create a work where the ‚Äúviewer receives more from it the more he or she looks‚Äù. Folley's controversial commission received a mixed response. The Ecclesiastical response to the work was approval; Chudley said ‚ÄúIt is slightly controversial, perhaps, but so dramatic. The viewer receives more from it the more he or she looks‚Äù. In his dedication of the work The Bishop of Bradwell, Right Reverend Laurie Green explained to the congregation that Folley ‚Äúhas depicted the Descent of the Body of Christ from the Cross like the icons of old‚Äù to ‚Äúmeditate and reflect on the scene of utter horror‚Äù. In the transcript of the dedication he continues, ‚ÄúWe want the brutal truth told but not in a brutal way‚Äù. In summing up his dedication the bishop stated: \\"This was truth seen through the believing eye of the artist [‚Ä¶]We should embrace the vision\\". Others however found the work to be ‚Äòsavage‚Äô. On the last visit the painter made to view the work in 2007 he found the painting behind a curtain; as the church warden informed him, ‚Äúunfortunately, some of our congregation still find the image too painful to look at‚Äù. The commission remit from Chudley was to paint a work which engages, inspires and up lifts the viewer to contemplate the historical and mystical human presence as found in the scene. With this in mind the painter included many Christian iconographic references. Two examples from the painter's private notes: Firstly, in keeping with the fifteenth century tradition, Chudley has been depicted in the role of the doner; kneeling in prayer with his attention transfixed upon the body of Christ. Secondly, the painter has included himself in the painting not as an ego motive but as a reflection of the Horation adage; 'the painter must live through his subjects‚Äô actions so that their depiction is emotionally convincing. Chudley was introduced to Folley in 1976 when he was curate-in- charge of the Plymouth parish of Leigham and Glenholt where the painter had a studio. At the time, the painter was painting his version of the crucifixion inspired by Hieronymus Bosch‚Äôs The Garden of Earthly Delights. Impressed by the teenager's artistic ability The Revd Chudley asked if he could have the finished work. Unfortunately it was never finished and subsequently destroyed by the painter in 1982. Twenty years later in 1995, Folley was commissioned to paint a large altar painting depicting Christ's Descent from the Cross. The painting's first public unveiling was on Thursday 28 March 1996 at St. Andrew's Church Plymouth prior to the painting's transportation to Wickford. The Bishop of Bradwell the Laurie Green, unveiled and blessed the work on 5 Ma 1996, at the 09.30am Eucharist.

He is currently a professor in the department of neurosurgery at Indiana University School of Medicine and a neurosurgeon at Indiana University Health. He was selected as one of the most effective 100 neurosurgeons in the United States by the prestigious American Academy of Neurological Surgery. He has extensive experience with surgeries of brain tumors, aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations and microvascular decompression surgery for hemifacial spasm and trigeminal neuralgia. He is one of the few surgeons in the United States who performs removal of complex brain tumors via endoscopic techniques, which use the natural nasal pathways instead of opening the skull. This technique provides patients with more effective surgeries and faster recovery. He has contributed to the refinement of intraoperative fluorescent technologies to maximize removal of brain tumors and improve patients' survival. The fluorescent technology causes the brain tumor to \\"glow,\\" enabling the surgeon to detect invisible margins of the tumor. Cohen is also the creator and chief editor/president of The Neurosurgical Atlas Inc, a non-for-profit organization. The Neurosurgical Atlas and its web-based learning resource promote excellence and safety in neurosurgical techniques. The development of the Atlas lasted for 10 years and was partly delayed due to the technological limitations of the internet at the time. It finally was introduced in 2016. Within four years of its introduction and by February 2020, The Neurosurgical Atlas had served a total of over 35,000 national and international neurosurgeon/resident members and an average of 1,700 viewers per day. This Atlas is the most trusted and comprehensive resource for learning complex brain operations in the world, reflecting the surgical experience of Dr. Cohen, who has performed more than 4,000 complex brain operations. The Atlas remains the most respectable, advanced and accessible platform for the introduction of innovative and safe neurosurgical cranial procedures. Many countries depend on the Atlas for the care of their patients. Cohen is also involved in guiding and teaching fellow neurosurgeons in handling complex surgical procedures including brain tumors, aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations. As of 2018, he is the Director of fNeurosurgical Oncology/Brain Tumor Surgery at the Indiana University Department of Neurosurgery. Cohen serves as the associate editor-in-chief of Neurosurgical Focus, a highly reputable journal in the field of neurosurgery. He has also served in numerous leadership roles nationally and was recently elected to serve on the Board of Directors of the American Association of Neurosurgeons (AANS) and the ‚ÄúSenior‚Äù Society of Neurological Surgeons (SNS). Cohen is the co-founder and co- director of the Center for the Cure of Glioblastoma, part of the Indiana University School of Medicine. He founded this center to facilitate new treatment options for brain tumor patients by mentoring neuroscientists and researchers. This research is funded in part by Mary Ann and Gene Zink whose remarkable generosity have made world class research in brain tumors possible, bringing hope to patients suffering from brain cancer. Cohen also has a master's degree in business administration and is actively involved in national efforts to improve access and quality of care for patients. Early life Cohen was born into a Conservative Jewish family in Tehran, Iran. His father is a businessman and his mother is a homemaker. Following the Iranian revolution in 1979 and subsequent discrimination against Jews, he escaped Iran through the Kavir Desert in Southeast Iran (considered one of the most hostile climates in the world) and became a refugee at the United Nations in Pakistan. He ultimately was able to reach the United States through the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society in Austria at the age of 19. When asked about his escape, he said, ‚ÄúIt improved my determination for reaching excellence and taught me that hardships in life can have good results if you overcome them. I‚Äôm proud and blessed to be an American citizen and live in the land of opportunity.‚Äù He completed his undergraduate (B.A. in bioengineering) and M.D. degrees from the University of California at San Diego and Keck School of Medicine of USC, respectively. Career Cohen completed his residency training in neurosurgery at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. He also completed advanced fellowship training in two subspecialties: epilepsy surgery (Yale University) and skull base/cerebrovascular surgery (University of Arkansas Medical Sciences.) He also attained a master's degree in Clinical Research from Mayo Clinic Graduate School. He is currently involved in the care of patients requiring brain surgery, specifically for a variety of brain tumors (gliomas and meningiomas,) complex brain tumors (skull base, acoustic, and pituitary tumors,) cerebral aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations, trigeminal neuralgia, hemifacial spasm, and seizures. Yearly, Cohen performs approximately 400 brain operations. Cohen is an internationally renowned neurosurgeon who takes on the most difficult surgical cases with optimal results. He is among the few surgeons in the world who has successfully performed such a high number of complex brain tumor and aneurysm surgeries. Cohen became a leader in developing endoscopic techniques that allow a surgeon to remove a brain tumor without opening the patient's skull, via the nasal passage. He also has helped refine fluorescent technologies that cause a brain tumor to ‚Äúglow,‚Äù making it easier for a surgeon to see precisely where its margins are. He has written and contributed to approximately 438 peer-reviewed publications, advancing the efficacy of neurosurgical operations. He has created several apps to assist patients and health care professionals. In cooperation with the Brain Aneurysm Foundation and The Neurosurgical Atlas, he created the Brain Aneurysm app, a collection of instructional videos and information that assists in raising public awareness of brain aneurysms. The app also connects to the Brain Aneurysm Foundation patient forum so users can stay connected wherever they are. The tool is intended to empower patients about their condition and encourage them to make well-informed decisions about their aneurysm care. He founded the AANS Operative Grand Rounds in 2009, which is a comprehensive web-based resource for training neurosurgeons across the world.AANS Operative Grand Rounds Master Series On-Demand http://www.aans.org/Education%20and%20Meetings/Master%20Series/AANS%20Operative%20Grand%20Rounds.aspx In addition, the AANS Grand Rounds apps contain a comprehensive collection of videos that were produced jointly by Cohen, the Neurosurgical Atlas, and the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS). These videos are in- depth discussions with experts on surgical techniques, approaches, pearls and pitfalls. Awards and honors Cohen was voted the Health Care Hero of the Year in the State of IndianaHealth Care Heroes: Past Recipients http://www.ibj.com/health-care-heroes-past-recipients/PARAMS/article/22777 for leading the efforts to advance surgical care of brain aneurysms and tumors previously considered inoperable/untreatable. He is among a small group of surgeons performing such operations in the United States. He was granted the Hemispherectomy Foundation's Humanitarian award for his efforts to support children who undergo the complex seizure surgery called hemispherectomy. He is also the co-chair of the Medical Advisory Board for this foundation. Cohen's surgical success stories have been featured on CNN's \\"The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer,\\" CBS‚Äô \\"The Doctors\\" and many others television shows. He was featured on CNN for removal of a brain tumor located in a crucial part of the brain controlling important functions in a 19-year-old man while the patient was awake.Awake Brain Surgery by Dr. Aaron Cohen-Gadol https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiUMy0P7ewM He created a map of the function of his brain and avoided the important brain areas while removing the tumor. Whether it's performing operations on children with extreme forms of epilepsy or removing tumors through the nasal passage, Cohen works tirelessly to heal what is arguably the most delicate part of the human body: the brain. ‚ÄúI have always treated my job as an art and passion, and that‚Äôs why I love coming to work every day,‚Äù said Cohen. ‚ÄúIf you really enjoy what you do, then you really want to put everything you have into it and you will always want to excel in every possible way but it has to be a passion.‚Äù In addition to a desire to heal, he feels driven to perfect new and unusual brain surgeries to ensure the least possible harm and the greatest possible benefits to patients. To achieve this goal, he uses a wide range of methods to refine and improve the effectiveness of known surgical techniques. In all recent years (2013-2020), Cohen was named one of Indianapolis Monthly's Top Doctors for Neurological Surgery. Personal life Cohen is married to Isabelle Saparzadeh and has two daughters (Lianna and Serene) and one son (Aaron Leon). In his free time, he studies non-medical technologies including 3-D animation and photography. He also volunteers to perform therapeutic surgery on dogs with brain tumors.

Owned and maintained by the Woodland Trust, Fifehead Wood covers a total area of , and is situated upon a ridge of Corallian Limestone within the depths of Blackmoor Vale. The name 'Fifehead' is thought to originate with an assessment made during the Domesday census of 1086, the village at that time comprising 'five hides' of land. Ecosystem Flora such as the musky- smelling helmet flower (Anemone nemorosa), the five-faced bishop (Adoxa), the early purple orchid (Orchis mascula), and the yellow pimpernel (Lysimachia nemorum) grow within Fifehead Wood, while bluebell carpets appear each spring. Maps produced by the Ordnance Survey from 1805 to 1811 reveal that Fifehead Wood has remained substantially unchanged for over two centuries. The woodland is therefore classed as 'Ancient Semi-Natural', and has been designated a Site of Nature Conservation Interest. The trees living at Fifehead are predominantly broad-leaved like the English oak (Quercus robur), field maple (Acer campestre) and common ash (Fraxinus excelsior). Mercurialis perennis (commonly known as dog's mercury), blackberry (Rubus fruticosus), common bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), and honeysuckle (Lonicera periclymenum) make up most of the understorey. Hazel (Corylus) has been regularly coppiced here over the years ‚Äî this ancient practice still continues (although on a much smaller scale than previously), chiefly to preserve the existing habitat. In the past, the tenants of Fifehead would have been required to pay duty to the lord of the manor in numerous different ways. Maintenance and upkeep of the ditches and enclosures within the immediate area was the responsibility of those that inhabited it, and a steady supply of brushwood and timber from the wood was demanded. Fifehead Wood provides the light orange underwing moth (Archiearis notha) with its sole Dorset residence. The site also has a large variety of butterflies, such as the white admiral (Limenitis camilla) and the purple hairstreak (Neozephyrus quercus). Breeding populations of several different birds inhabit Fifehead Wood. Grey heron and great spotted woodpeckers may be spotted, and treecreepers can also be observed spiraling within the habitat, as they ascend tree trunks in a progression of small hops.

The summit and surrounding area are known for their abundances of semiprecious minerals including topaz, red beryl and opal. Geology and geography Topaz Mountain is part of the Thomas Range in Juab County, Utah, approximately 36 miles Northwest of Delta, Utah. It lies on publicly owned land managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Collection of rocks and mineral is permitted there and, as a result, the area is frequented by amateur and professional rock hounds. Red beryl in topaz-bearing rhyolite, and water- laid rhyolitic tuff, was known on Topaz Mountain since 1905. This Tertiary age tuff is found throughout the Thomas Range. In 1959, beryllium deposits (bertrandite) were found overlying this tuff on Spor Mountain. Minerals =Topaz= Topaz is a semiprecious gemstone that occurs as very hard, transparent crystals in a variety of colors. It is naturally amber-colored, but becomes colorless after exposure to sunlight. Topaz forms within cavities of the volcanic rock rhyolite, from eruptions that occurred during the Tertiary Period six to seven million years ago. Topaz is embedded in the rhyolite rock, and also found loose on the slopes and arroyos. =Red beryl= Red beryl, a rare mineral found at Topaz Mountain, occurs as small crystals, often attached to other mineral crystals.

History and architecture  Baltica berthing at the pier The first jetties were built from about 1895; they were the forerunners of those in Brunshaupten and Arendsee. Because these simple wooden structures could not cope with the strong ice drift in the winter, they frequently had to be replaced. The first large jetties were built in 1901 to enable sailing boat services to call here. In 1906, piers were built large enough to enable steamboats to tie up, thus negating the inconvenience of ferrying passengers from the ships in tenders. A pier was built in 1929, but this, too, could not withstand the weather. The last pier was destroyed in the winter of 1941/42. During East German times, the continued shortage of material and construction capacity prevented a new pier being built. This also prevented people escaping the country to the West. The new pier was built in 1991 in the suburb of Ost. It is 240 metres long and oriented axially to the beach road (Strandstra√üe). The pier is located on the longest German Baltic Sea beach promenade, which is about 3.2 km long, and the pier was the first new pier to be built on the Baltic Sea coast in Mecklenburg. It is considered to be one of the landmarks of the town and is one of the 189 piers in the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.  Pier forecourt  Pier forecourt with the protected sculpture of Vater und Sohn (\\"Father and Son\\") The remodelling of the pier forecourt was carried out in phases. The Kopfsituation, with its Forum and Bastion, was built in 1992. The forecourt was designed in 1991. The running area (Laufachse) and ramps, the pavements and the play area (Spielachse) were added in 1995. On the forecourt the protected sculpture Vater und Sohn (\\"Father and Son\\"), sculpted in the 1970s by Reinhard Schmidt, has been erected.

Described as a \\"natural rower\\", she went to the 2009 World Rowing Junior Championships within a few months of having taken up rowing and won a silver medal. She represented New Zealand at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London as the country's youngest Olympian at those games. She was the 2015 world champion in the women's double sculls with Zoe Stevenson. At the 2016 Summer Olympics, they came fourth in the semi-finals and thus missed the A final. Junior rowing Macfarlane was born in 1992 and grew up in Parnassus, just north of Cheviot. She was educated at Rangi Ruru Girls' School in Christchurch where she was into many sports, including \\"netball, basketball, athletics, volleyball, touch, cross-country running\\". She excelled at any sport she tried and Rex Farrelly, Rangi Ruru's long-term rowing coach, asked her if she wanted to try rowing, which she started in 2009. Farrelly says that \\"there's very few natural rowers. Eve was one.\\" Gary Hay, one of the other rowing coaches at Rangi Ruru, describes her as a natural rower: Macfarlane competed for Rangi Ruru in the 2009 and 2010 Maadi Cup national secondary school rowing championships, and was a member of the crews that won the Levin 75th Jubilee Cup (girls under-18 eights) and Dawn Cup (girls under-18 coxed fours) for the school in both years. Her 2009 Maadi Cup appearance guaranteed her a place in the junior women's eight that went to the World Rowing Junior Championships in August 2009 in Brive-la-Gaillarde, France; within months of having taken up rowing, she won a silver medal at a World Rowing Junior Championship. Zoe Stevenson and Francie Turner were also in the boat. Macfarlane changed to a women's four and with Beatrix Heaphy- Hall, Jennifer Storey, and Grace Prendergast, she won gold at the 2010 World Rowing Junior Championships in Raƒçice, Czech Republic. At the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics in Singapore, she won the B Final with Beatrix Heaphy-Hall in the junior women's pair. Elite rowing She changed to the elite class in 2011, having skipped the under 23 class, and came under the guidance of national coach Dick Tonks. Tonks changed her from a sweep rower to a sculler and placed her in a women's quadruple scull. The four, which included Sarah Gray, Fiona Bourke and Louise Trappitt, surprised themselves by winning bronze at the regattas in Hamburg (Germany) and Lucerne (Switzerland). They maintained their form and won a bronze at the 2011 World Rowing Championships at Lake Bled in Bled, Slovenia.

Macfarlane was New Zealand's youngest representative in London. In 2013, Macfarlane was part of the women's eight. At regattas in Sydney (Australia) and Lucerne (Switzerland), they came fifth and sixth, respectively. At the 2013 World Rowing Championships held at Tangeum Lake in Chungju, South Korea, the eight came first in the B final. MacFarlane did not race in 2014. At regattas in Varese (Italy) and Lucerne (Switzerland) in 2015, she competed in the double sculls with Zoe Stevenson, winning gold in both finals.

Initially appointed to command the Parliamentary garrison at Barnstaple, he showed considerable ability, and was quickly promoted. Wounded and captured after the Royalist victory at the Battle of Stratton in May 1643, he changed sides, possibly as a result of being accused of responsibility for the defeat. His father, Sir George Chudleigh, also a Parliamentary commander, switched sides at the same time. On 30 September 1643, Chudleigh was wounded in a Royalist attack on Dartmouth, where he died on 6 October. Biographical details James Chudleigh was the fourth of nine sons of Sir George Chudleigh, and his wife Mary Strode (1586‚Äì1645). The family were members of the Devon gentry; his father was a Member of Parliament, and purchased a baronetcy in 1622. James was born in 1618 at Ashton Manor, a family possession from 1320 until 1735. It is possible his brothers avoided direct participation in the Civil War; although later claimed George and Christopher 'fought for Parliament', there is no record of this. Another, Thomas, served in Ireland until October 1643, when his regiment returned to England to reinforce the Western Royalist army. He does not appear on its muster rolls after April 1643, and is next recorded as a surgeon in Exeter in 1648. As with many others, James' family ties show the complexity of relationships in the period. His maternal uncle, William Strode, 1594 to 1645, was imprisoned from 1629 to 1640 for opposing arbitrary taxes, and one of the Five Members whose attempted arrest in January 1642 was a key stage on the road to war. His cousin, Sir Alexander Carew, was executed by Parliament in 1644 for plotting to betray Plymouth to the Royalists. Another, Alexander's half-brother John, signed Charles' death warrant in 1649, and was hanged, drawn and quartered in October 1660 as a regicide. Career Details of Chudleigh's early life are limited, other than he reportedly served in Ireland. In 1640, he was Captain in the Earl of Northumberland‚Äôs regiment, part of the army raised for the Bishops Wars. He became involved in the 1641 Army Plots, an alleged conspiracy to seize London, release the Earl of Strafford, and dissolve the Long Parliament. Along with Lord Goring, governor of Portsmouth, and Northumberland's younger brother Henry, he was investigated by Parliament, but appears to have served as a courier, and was released without charge. When the First English Civil War began in August 1642, Chudleigh apparently tried to join the Royalists, but was rejected on the grounds his father and uncle were ‚Äònotoriously disaffected to the King‚Äô. Instead, Parliament authorised him to raise \\"1,000 dragoons...in Somerset, Devon, and Cornwall\\", which he used to garrison Barnstaple in north Devon. During this period, he supervised construction of Chudleigh Fort, near Bideford. The Earl of Stamford, Parliamentary commander in the West Country, appointed Chudleigh his deputy, although he later claimed he had been ordered to do so. Chudleigh was one of the few who performed well in their defeat at Braddock Down in January 1643. On 21 February, he led an attack that captured Modbury, a village held by the Royalists for the siege of Plymouth. On 28 February, the two sides agreed a local truce, which ended on 22 April. In anticipation, Chudleigh assembled 1,700 troops at Lifton, near Launceston, where Hopton had concentrated over 3,600 men. He attacked the next day, but the Royalists quickly recovered; faced by superior numbers, the Parliamentary force withdrew to Okehampton; supported by John Merrick's \\"Greycoats\\", Chudleigh covered the retreat, reportedly taking personal control of saving the artillery.1643 ‚Äì Civil War in the South-West Chudleigh Fort, near Bideford; much of this dates from the 19th century On 25 April, the Royalist leader Sir Ralph Hopton marched on Sourton Down, intending to stop there for the night, and attack Okehampton at dawn. At 9:00 pm, Chudleigh learned the enemy was only away, and also discovered his artillery transport had been taken to Crediton. Since retreat meant abandoning his guns, he ambushed the Royalists with only 100 cavalry; at night, and in the middle of a violent thunderstorm, they panicked and broke. Although not present at Sourton Down, Stamford was given credit for the victory, a rare piece of good news for Parliament in the west. Using intelligence captured there, he marched into Cornwall with 5,400 men, first sending his cavalry under Sir George Chudleigh on a diversionary raid against Bodmin. Despite being outnumbered, Hopton won a decisive victory at Stratton on 16 May, which ensured Royalist control of Devon. Defeat was a combination of factors, including the outstanding courage of the Cornish infantry, and absence of the Parliamentary cavalry. The last was an unwise counter-attack by Chudleigh; initially successful, it exposed the Parliamentary centre to a flanking attack. Efforts to stop the collapse failed; the Parliamentarians lost 300 casualties, and 1,700 prisoners, including Chudleigh. Taken to the Royalist capital in Oxford, Chudleigh switched sides; his reasons were set out in a Royalist propaganda pamphlet, published under his name. This reflected his importance to the Parliamentary cause in Devon; shortly before Stratton, he published a similar attack on the Royalists. In his 'History of the Rebellion', the Earl of Clarendon, then a senior Royalist advisor, claimed he fought bravely until captured, and changed sides as a matter of conscience. The battlefield at Stratton Stamford escaped to Exeter, where Sir George was governor; the city surrendered in early September to Prince Maurice, whose army now included Colonel James Chudleigh. The garrison was given a pass to the nearest friendly territory, and Stamford returned to London. On arrival, he claimed his defeat was due to Chudleigh deserting during the battle, which varies from other reports he was captured only after being wounded. Stamford never held command again, suggesting he was held responsible. Sir George resigned his commission, arguing that while he supported the protection of law and religion, \\"the destruction of a kingdom cannot be the way to save it\\". As Cornwall was occupied by the Royalists until the war ended in 1646, he 'garrisoned' Ashton Manor, but avoided active participation; in 1647, he was fined for being a Royalist, although it is possible he escaped payment. In September 1643, James Chudleigh took part in a Royalist assault on Dartmouth; according to Clarendon, he was wounded on or around 30 September, and died a few days later. On 6 October, he was buried in St Saviours church, Dartmouth.

He received civilian awards from the Indian and French governments and won an Olympic silver medal on behalf of Great Britain. Personal life and studies Born on 19 April 1915 in Kharagpur, West Bengal, Kar trained at the Indian Society of Oriental Art run by Abanindranath Tagore. He was taught to sculpt by Giridhari Mahapatra and Victor Giovanelli. Kar moved to Paris in 1938 where he studied at the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re before moving back to India. Chintamoni Kar was married to Amina Kar and the couple had one child. Both members of his family died before Chintamoni, who died on 3 October 2005 in a private hospital at the age of 90. Style and career Kar sculpted with a variety a materials including wood, terracotta, stone, and metal. He was initially trained in an academic and representational style but also produced work of a more abstract nature. Kar taught at the University of Calcutta and the Delhi Polytechnic and then, in 1946, moved to London where he became a member of the Royal Society of British Sculptors. He returned to West Bengal in 1956 and was then elected as Principal of the Government College of Art & Craft. Honours and awards In 1974 he was awarded the Padma Bhushan, the third highest civilian award in the Republic of India. He was also decorated with France's highest civilian honour in 2000. Chintamoni Kar Bird Sanctuary was named after the sculptor after he and other people from the local area fought for it to receive wildlife sanctuary status. At the 1948 Summer Olympics Kar, entered as a competitor for Great Britain, won the silver medal for his work entitled The Stag. Held in London, the 1948 Games were the final ones to include art competitions and the International Olympic Committee no longer recognise the medals. Bhaskar Bhavan Administration & Maintenance Trust Shortly before his death in 2005 Kar instituted the Bhaskar Bhavan Administration & Maintenance Trust at his residential campus in Narendrapur, Kolkata. It became a public museum on 19 April 2006, what would have been his 91st birthday, and houses the artist's works as well as those of his wife. The trust is active in the verification and documentation of his works along with his collection of books. It also aids poor students in the local area and holds the annual Chintamoni Kar Memorial lecture.

Sumner-Fredericksburg High School is located in Sumner along with Durant Elementary School. The students from both towns voted on the mascot and colors and chose Cougars to be the mascot and the colors: Navy Blue, Forest Green, and Vegas Gold. The districts decided to join the Upper Iowa Conference which boasted Sumner's rival North Fayette and Fredericksburg's Turkey Valley. Together they have made their own rivals of North Fayette, Turkey Valley, and Wapsie Valley.

Founded in 1979 and headquartered in Washington D.C., the division has over 1700 members dedicated to fostering safety in the field of chemistry and related disciplines. Sharing these interests, DCHAS works with a variety of sister professional organizations including the American Chemical Society's Committee on Chemical Safety, AIChE's Center for Process Safety, Campus Safety, Health and Environmental Association, and AIHA Laboratory Safety Committee. Origins The origin of Division of Chemical Health and Safety dates back to Washington D.C. in September 1979 at the meeting of the American Chemical Society. It was at this meeting that the Committee on Divisional Activities entertained the idea of elevating the provisional Chemical Health and Safety to full division status. Following much discussion the recommendation was rejected on a purposed formality. Understanding the importance of division status, Glenn T. Seaborg advocated for the recommendation with success at the meeting of what was called the Science Commission, and the Division of Chemical Health and Safety was established. Glenn T. Seaborg, a world-renown radiochemist, co-discovered plutonium and nine other transuranium elements. While working on the Manhattan Project, he devised a method of extracting and purifying plutonium. In 1944, his \\"actinide concept\\" of heavy element electronic structure changed the periodic table to include the transition series of transuranium elements. Dr. Seaborg shared the 1951 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his work with the new elements. In 1947, President Harry S. Truman appointed Dr. Seaborg to the newly established Atomic Energy Commission. Dr. Seaborg continued his public service work as an advisor to the next six administrations and, under President Ronald Reagan, as a member of the National Commission on Excellence in Education. Dr. Seaborg has served as president of the American Chemical Society (1976) and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1973). Today, he works to further a national commitment to basic scientific research and the safe management of nuclear materials. Editor Carl Gottschall spoke with Dr. Seaborg about the challenges of working safely in a brand new field of chemistry.‚Äù Contributions The main contributions of the division in the field of chemical health and safety are technical presentations at ACS National and Regional meetings. In addition, e-mail discussion list, DCHAS-L, hosts active exchanges of chemical safety information. Mission The objectives of the Division of Chemical Health & Safety are *to promote chemical health and safety; *to provide a forum for discussing laws and regulations relating to chemical health and safety; *to disseminate information on the properties of chemicals which affect health and safety directly or through the environment; *to promote the exchange of scientific information among various disciplines that make up the division; and *to work with other ACS divisions and professional societies on issues relating to chemical health and safety. Membership Membership in the Division of Chemical Health and Safety is a powerful tool for chemical health and safety professionals in industry, academia and government. Membership in the division benefits all with a professional interest in chemical health and safety. It affords the opportunity to meet people with similar interests and offers a medium, through its meetings and publications, to share knowledge, concerns, and criticisms with others throughout the world. While the newsletter keeps members up to date on meetings and division activities, the Journal keeps members up to date on publications and current health and safety topics. Awards DCHAS provides several awards, recognizing outstanding leadership and service in the area of chemical health and safety, including: * Howard Fawcett Chemical Health and Safety Award * SafetyStratus College and University Health and Safety Award * Tillmanns-Skolnick Award * CHAS Student Registration Award * Laboratory Safety Institute Graduate Research Faculty Safety Award * Service Awards * CHAS Fellows Award The Awards page of the DCHAS website provides more information about these awards, including the nomination and selection process.
