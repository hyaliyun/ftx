It serves the Ecclesiastical Parish of Horncastle and a grade II* listed building that was heavily restored by Ewan Christian between 1859 and 1861. History It is thought that a Roman church once stood on the site. This appears to have been succeeded by a Saxon Minster, although construction of the present building started c.1250. The building appears to have experienced two major works of restoration: * The first, which took place around 1660, once he had been restored as Vicar of Horncastle, and is commemorated on the south wall near to the altar rails by a large metal painted plaque, is credited to The Rev'd Thomas Gibson. Gibson was ill-treated during the Civil War and deprived of his living for some years. * The 1859‚Äì61 restoration is commemorated by a stained glass window in memory of The Rev'd Canon W H Milner, who is credited with being the primary driving force behind the restoration. Whilst remaining in regular use as the Parish Church of Horncastle, by 2001 a Roman Catholic congregation was also using the building for its Mass on Saturday evenings at 6:00 pm and continues to have Mass there at that time.Woodhall Spa Catholic Parish Newsletter 26 October 2014 Architecture The building is dominated by three architectural styles: * Early English as seen in the five-bay nave arcade (the upper sections of which were re-built in 1859-61), internal tower arch with pointed head and western-facing lancet windows, with their moulded string courses. * Perpendicular as evident in the north and south chancel chapels and nave clerestory, with its five 15th century windows. * Victorian restoration seen especially in the east window, chancel arch, nave aisles, porches and vestry office. The floor level at the east end of the church was raised in height by two feet during the 1859-61 restoration, in order to accommodate the central heating system. There are also some Georgian influences (such as the heavily restored 14th century piscina, which may be found in the chancel's south wall). Governance Horncastle Parish is part of the South Wolds Group of Churches, which was inaugurated by Bishop John of Lincoln during a service in St Mary‚Äôs Horncastle on 7 November 2010. This benefice is sub divided into three groups: * The Asterby Group; * The Hemingby Group; and * The Horncastle Group.

It is part of the broad category of inertial fusion energy (IFE) systems, which uses the inward movement of the fusion fuel to reach densities and temperatures where fusion reactions take place. Previous IFE experiments used laser drivers to reach these conditions, whereas MagLIF uses a combination of lasers for heating and Z-pinch for compression. A variety of theoretical considerations suggest such a system will reach the required conditions for fusion with a machine of significantly less complexity than the pure-laser approach. Description MagLIF is a method of generating energy by using a 100 nanosecond pulse of electricity to create an intense Z-pinch magnetic field that inwardly crushes a fuel filled cylindrical metal liner (a hohlraum) through which the electric pulse runs. Just before the cylinder implodes, a laser is used to preheat fusion fuel (such as deuterium-tritium) that is held within the cylinder and contained by a magnetic field. Sandia National Labs is currently exploring the potential for this method to generate energy by utilizing the Z machine. MagLIF has characteristics of both Inertial confinement fusion (due to the usage of a laser and pulsed compression) and magnetic confinement (due to the utilization of a powerful magnetic field to inhibit thermal conduction and contain the plasma). In results published in 2012, a LASNEX based computer simulation of a 70 megaampere facility showed the prospect of a spectacular energy return of 1000 times the expended energy. A 60 MA facility would produce a 100x yield. The currently available facility at Sandia, Z machine, is capable of 27 MA and may be capable of producing slightly more than breakeven energy while helping to validate the computer simulations. The Z-machine conducted MagLIF experiments in November 2013 with a view towards breakeven experiments using D-T fuel in 2018. Sandia Labs planned to proceed to ignition experiments after establishing the following: # That the liner will not break apart too quickly under the intense energy. This has been apparently confirmed by recent experiments. This hurdle was the biggest concern regarding MagLIF following its initial proposal. # That laser preheating is able to correctly heat the fuel -- to be confirmed by experiments starting in December 2012. # That magnetic fields generated by a pair of coils above and below the hohlraum can serve to trap the preheated fusion fuel and importantly inhibit thermal conduction without causing the target to buckle prematurely. -- to be confirmed by experiments starting in December 2012. Following these experiments, an integrated test started in November 2013. The test yielded about 1010 high-energy neutrons. As of November 2013, the facility at Sandia labs had the following capabilities: # 10 tesla magnetic field # 2 kJ laser # 16 MA # D-D fuel In 2014, the test yielded up to 2√ó1012 D-D neutrons under the following conditions: # 10 tesla magnetic field # 2.5 kJ laser # 19 MA # D-D fuel Experiments aiming for energy breakeven with D-T fuel were expected to occur in 2018. To achieve scientific breakeven, the facility is going through a 5-year upgrade to: # 30 teslas # 8 kJ laser # 27 MA # D-T fuel handling In 2019, after encountering significant problems related to mixing of imploding foil with fuel and helical instability of plasma, the tests yielded up to 3.2√ó1012 neutrons under the following conditions: # 1.2 kJ laser # 18 MA See also * National Ignition Facility * Nuclear fusion * Z-pinch References Category:Inertial confinement fusion ","title":"Magnetized Liner Inertial Fusion"},{"id":"35427979","text":"Diploschizia mexicana is a species of sedge moth in the genus Diploschizia.

The building is now home to the Nordea Foundation and a museum dedicated to banks and saving banks, as well as six residences available to foreign researchers and specialists. History =Early history= Hans Peder Kofoed A brewery was built at the site in 1753. In 1785 it was acquired by Hans Peder Kofoed (1743‚Äì 1812), a sea captain from Bornholm, who constructed a large house towards the street. It was probably designed by the architect Georg Erdman Rosenberg. Kofoed lived in the building with his wife, Marie Kofoed (1760 - 1838), and an adopted son from Saint Croix. When Marie Kofoed became a widow in 1812, she involved herself in philanthropic work in the local community, supporting unmarried women and widows of seamen financially, and continued to live in the house until her own death in 1838. =The Heering era= Advertisement for Peter Heerings Manufactory of Cherry-Cordial from 1857 The house was then purchased by Peter Frederik Suhm Heering who needed more space for his expanding business enterprises.

And by 1858, his company, Heering Line, operated a fleet of ten merchant ships which sailed on South America and the Mediterranean Sea. The Heering House on a drawing by Peter Tom-Petersen from c. 1900 After Peter Heering's death in 1875, the property remained in the Heering family for another four generations. =Later history= In 1977 the property was purchased by the Private Bank (Privatbanken) in 1977. Parts of the building was then rented out to the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In 1999 the property changed hands once again when it was acquired by the Nordea Foundation. From 2008 to 2011 it underwent a DKK 100 mio. renovation. Architecture keystone above the gate, featuring a claw The main wing towards the street is built in the Neoclassical style. It is 16 bays long and consists of three storeys and a six-bay attica topped by a baluster-balustrade. A sculpted cow's claw on the ketstone above the gateway dates from the first owner of the house, Hans Peder Kofoed, and is a reference to his family name, Kofoed, which translates as \\"cow's foot\\" and is a name commonly associated with his native island of Bornholm. A lateral wing on the rear of the building was added in 1926-1927 to a design by Bent Helweg-M√∏ller (1883-1956). It received an award from the City in 1929. The site also comprises the original brewery building which dates from 1759. Nordea Foundation The Nordea Foundation (Nordea-fonden) now has its secretariat in the building. The renovation also installed six residences which are available on grant to foreign researchers and specialists under the foundation's residence program. Bank and Saving Museum  Barrels in the cellar under the main wing The Bank and Saving Museum (Bank- og Sparekassemuseet) was founded by the Private Bank at B√∏rsen in 1857 to mark the 100-years anniversary of the bank's foundation. The displays include the former office of Carl Frederik Tietgen (1829‚Äì1901), the bank's founder and director over four decades, who has also been labelled as the most significant Danish entrepreneur of all times. After his death in 1901, the office was transferred to the bank's new headquarters at C.F. Tietgens Hus on B√∏rsgade and left untouched until the opening of the museum. The museum also features a bank branch, complete with all inventory from c. 1900, and other artifacts from the history of the Danish bank sector. The museum also has a large exhibition space for changing exhibitions in an adjoining building.

He is currently the Chairman of Lalin Michael Jinasena & Co. and the former Chairman of Loadstar(PVT) Limited, which was the largest export company in Sri Lanka. Early Life and Family Born to T. S. Jinasena and his wife Lily in Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, Nihal Jinasena was the oldest in the family with three brothers and educated at St. Thomas College, Mount Lavinia. He went on to study at Loughborough University in the UK, gaining a BE in Mechanical Engineering in 1962. There he was President of the Student Union, a rare distinction for any student and the first Sri Lankan to be elected. In 2000, he received an Honorary Doctorate in Technology from Loughbourg University. He is married to Sheryll Jinasena and has one son, Lalin Michael. His main residence is in Ekala, Sri Lanka. Career After graduation, Nihal Jinasena took up a position at Girling Ltd as a Senior Development Engineer. In 1965, he returned to Sri Lanka to revive the family engineering company, C Jinasena & Co. In the same year, his father T.S. Jinasena, turned his company over to his four sons and Dr. Nihal became managing director, a position he held until the group's division in 2009. The company was driven by Dr. Nihal and his three brothers ‚Äì like the grandfather and the father before them ‚Äì on the lines of profits and service to humanity. \\"Our single principle is, every employee must feel that he is a part owner of the company, his ideas of how it should be run are taken into account and he shares in the rewards and profits the company earns\\", says Dr. Nihal about his Company. History of Jinasena Group of Companies C Jinasena & Co. was founded in 1905 by Dr. Nihal's grandfather, C. Jinasena. It started as a workshop to repair bicycles and sewing machines and gradually grew into a machinery repair workshop that serviced the rubber, coconut and graphite industries. It was one of the few local engineering businesses competing with the British who dominated the manufacturing industry in Ceylon and a step in the direction of economic independence. In 1952, under the management of Dr. Nihal's father T.S. Jinasena, the Jinasena Group was diversified into production of water pumps. For many years, the Jinasena family was synonymous with the Centric Water Pumps, the first ever in the country and soon the most popular in the market. In 1965, the four Jinasena brothers were inducted into the business as partners and in 1967 the company was incorporated as Jinasena Limited and Jinasena Castings Limited. The 1970s saw the start of substantial growth with the formation of companies in the areas of electrical motor manufacturing, agricultural machinery, hotels, clothing, seafood export, computer software and solid rubber tyres, and in 2000 Jinasena consists of 17 companies and is one of the largest conglomerates in Sri Lanka. LMJ Group In 2009, the Jinasena Group decided to divide its assets between the four Jinasena brothers. The companies, which came to Dr. Nihal in this division, are now a part of the LMJ group, with his son Lalin Michael Jinasena as CEO and himself as chairman. The LMJ Group comprises companies, which were built up by Dr. Nihal under the Jinasena Company as well as companies created by Lalin. The Group is involved and pioneering in Hospitality and Food & Beverage, manufacturing and export, trading, web development, and includes a subsidiary interior decor company and owns among others the multi awarded boutique hotel Casa Colombo.

It was released in May 2015 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. Gameplay =Features= There are 74 drivable cars, over 30 unique locations with at least 110 different courses, of which 23 are real, with the remainder being fictional. For licensing reasons, some tracks are codenamed using their geographic location. In addition to real world racing circuits and fictional kart circuits, there are two fictional point-to-point roads inspired by C√¥te d'Azur and California Pacific Coast. =Physics simulation= Project CARS is intended to represent a realistic driving simulation. In order to differentiate the game from the established industry leaders, Gran Turismo and Forza Motorsport, Slightly Mad Studios' aim is a \\"sandbox\\" approach that allows the player to choose between a variety of different motorsports paths and grants immediate access to all included tracks and vehicles. Project CARS portrays racing events spanning multiple days, progressing from shakedown and qualifying runs to the race itself, while changes in weather and lighting conditions are simulated dynamically. The game adopts an improved version of the Madness engine, which was the basis for the Need for Speed: Shift titles. More processing power available in modern computers allows for the introduction of a dynamic tire model named \\"SETA\\", rather than the steady- state model based on lookup tables, as seen in previous generation simulations. To accommodate differing skill levels, Slightly Mad Studios offers gamers (with or without a digital wheel) various driver aids and input filtering methods. Development Project CARS, which stands for Community Assisted Racing Simulator, was made with a total sum of $5 million. Funding for the game was raised by the community and the developers themselves, without the financial aid of a traditional publisher. Through the purchase of Tool Packs players could contribute to development in roles including content creation, QA, and marketing media. Members gain special perks, depending on their purchased tool pack. Members will receive a share of game sales profits generated within the first three years after launch as compensation for their efforts, to be paid quarterly. In addition to community feedback, Slightly Mad Studios have acquired the professional services of racing driver and Top Gear's former The Stig, Ben Collins, Clio Cup and European Touring Car Cup racing driver Nicolas Hamilton, and former Formula Renault 3.5 and current WEC driver Oliver Webb. Cars in the console versions of the game are made from 60,000 polygons. On 26 August 2012 support for the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset was announced on the official forums. The announcement stated that at least one Oculus Rift Development Kit has been ordered. Members of the project are able to follow a link referenced in the forum post to read more details. Sony's PlayStation 4 virtual reality headset PlayStation VR will also be supported. It was released on 7 May 2015 in Europe and 12 May 2015 in America for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, while the Linux version was first delayed to later in 2015 and eventually cancelled. Project CARS was also originally due for release on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Wii U, but it was later announced that these versions had been cancelled. On 18 February 2015 it was announced that Project CARS would be delayed until 2 April 2015 for Europe, and eventually confirmed to be released on 7 May 2015 in Europe and Australia; 8 May 2015 in the UK; and 12 May 2015 in North America. On 12 May 2016, the game was updated for compatibility with the HTC Vive virtual reality headset. =Cancellation of Wii U version= In May 2015, it was revealed that the Wii U version would be put on hold. Studio boss Ian Bell said that the game's latest build was struggling to run smoothly on Nintendo's platform ‚Äì at a 720p resolution with a framerate of 23fps, and revealed that they are not allowed to release a game that is running below 30fps, but \\"finding that extra 25% frame time is currently looking impossible\\". In the official Forums he adds that the Wii U's market share was not worth the effort of porting. He explained that there was a possibility the game would be pushed for the Nintendo Switch, then known as the project NX. On 21 July 2015, Slightly Mad Studios informed the Nintendo Life news outlet that the Wii U version had been cancelled, with Ian Bell saying that the title was \\"simply too much\\" for the Wii U hardware to handle. Distribution partner Bandai Namco reaffirmed the cancellation. Despite Bell wishing to release the game on a Nintendo platform, in November 2016 it was confirmed that there were no plans for a Nintendo Switch port. Release Project CARS was released in different editions. In addition to the standard version of the game, the Project CARS Limited Edition was released at Day One. This edition featured a book called \\"Project Cars: By Racers 4 Racers\\" and five extra cars: the Ford GT40 Mk IV, BMW M1 Procar, McLaren F1, Sauber C9 and the Mercedes-Benz AMG C63 Class Coup√© DTM. Moreover, the pre-order version of both Limited and standard edition featured the Modified Car Pack containing three bonus cars: the Ruf CTR3 SMS-R, Pagani Zonda Cinque Roadster and the Ariel Atom Mugen. On 6 May 2016, Slightly Mad Studios released the complete edition of the game, titled Project CARS Game of the Year Edition. This version features all DLCs and free bonus content already released. Moreover, the complete version adds two new cars, the Pagani Zonda Revoluci√≥n and the Pagani Huayra BC, and the N√ºrburgring Nordschleife in its 24-hour configuration. Downloadable content The game was supported with both paid and free downloadable content (DLC) upon release. Project CARS was initially planned to follow the season-pass model but plans for that were replaced with a system called \\"On-Demand.\\" On-Demand was described as allowing a \\"commitment to keeping Project CARS up-to-date with the greatest, freshest, and most critical content whilst also allowing players to pick and choose the cars & tracks they want - without being locked in to a pre-paid scheme.\\" The first DLC was the Limited Edition Upgrade, released in June 2015, which added five cars already featured in the Project CARS Limited Edition. It was followed by the Racing Icons Car Pack, Modified Car Pack (which was also available as bonus content for the pre-order version of the game) and Old vs New Car Pack, all of which added new cars to the game. Still in 2015, the developers released the Audi Ruapuna Speedway Expansion, Aston Martin Track Expansion and the Classic Lotus Track Expansion which added new cars and four new racetracks: Mike Pero Motorsport Park, the historic version of Hockenheimring and Silverstone, Rouen-Les-Essarts and a fictional track called \\"Mojave Test Track\\". The Japanese Car Pack added new cars from Toyota, Mitsubishi and Scion, while the Renault Sport Car Pack featured five new Renault cars. In 2016, Slightly Mad released the Stanceworks Track Expansion, which added a new fictional track called \\"Bannochbrae\\" and the US Car Pack, which adds the Chevrolet Corvette C7.R and the Cadillac ATS-V.R GT3, together with the Dallara DW12 and the Ford Fusion stock car. The last DLC released in 2016 was the Pagani N√ºrburgring Combined Track Expansion. It added the bonus content featured in the Project Cars Game of the Year Edition. Reception =Critical reception= Project CARS was generally well received upon release. Gaming critic Matthew Kato of Game Informer stated: \\"The game joins a sim-racing field alongside already-established competitors like Gran Turismo and Forza, but it also does things its own way, challenging the ways of the past.\\" Destructoid Brett Makedonski praised the graphics and wrote: \\"One aspect of Project CARS that never fails to impress is its aesthetic. Everything is stunningly gorgeous at all times, even when the sun blinds you as you're trying to corner.\\" However, some complained of bugs, including PSU.com's Simon Sayers, who said: \\"During packed starting grids on some courses, they‚Äôll bunch up around the first corner and get tangled up like novices holding up everyone behind them.\\" =Sales= In the first week of physical sales in the UK, Project CARS sold 63 percent of its total on the PlayStation 4 console, with 31 percent on the Xbox One and 6 percent on the PC. By 5 June 2015, the game had sold one million copies. By October 2016, the game had sold 2 million units. The game was made free from February 16 - March 16, 2017 with the Xbox Games with Gold program. Sequels The sequel was announced on 22 June 2015. The sequel includes more tracks and modes such as rallycross. There are over 170+ cars at release and 60 locations all featuring Live Track 3.0 and a 24-hour day-night cycle. The sequel was released in 22 September 2017 and features new vehicle types and motorsport classes including Rallycross, IndyCar, and Oval.Newhouse, Alex (June 22, 2015). \\"Project Cars 2 is Coming, Will be Crowdfunded\\".

A multi-talented polyglot, he was the author of the first grammar of the Urdu language, Darya-e-Latafat. Life Insha's father, Sayyid Hakim Mir Masha Allah Khan was a famous physician and aristocrat. During a period of disturbance in Delhi, he moved to Murshidabad in Bengal, where Nawab Siraj-ud- Daula was his patron. His son Insha was born in Murshidabad. During the reign of Shah Alam II, Insha came to Delhi. In 1780, he joined the army of Mirza Najaf Khan, and later gained access to the royal court. His poetic skills and sarcastic wit made him well-known, and also unpopular with the poets of Delhi, such as Mirza Azim Beg. After the decline of Mughal power which led to the blinding of Shah Alam II in 1788, Insha decided to try his luck in Lucknow. In 1791, he joined the court of Mirza Sulaiman Shikoh (a Mughal prince then living in exile in Lucknow), entering into a legendary rivalry with the Mirza's ustad, the poet Mashafi, and eventually displacing him from his position. After some years, Insha moved on to the court of Saadat Ali Khan, the new ruler of Avadh, an association which writers such as Muhammad Husain Azad believe led to a decline in his poetry. Eventually, Insha fell from the ruler's grace after making a joke at his expense. He spent his last years bereft of patronage, in poor health, till his death in 1817. Work Insha was a versatile poet, who composed in Urdu, Persian, Arabic, and occasionally Turkish and Punjabi. His chief works are in his diwan of Urdu and Persian ghazals, as well as a volume of poems in rekhti (imitating the colloquial speech of women). He wrote ghazals, rubaiyat (quatrains), qatat in many languages, several Urdu and Persian masnavis, odes, satires, and also tried his hand at unconventional forms such as the riddle and the magic spell. His themes too are unconventional - no other poet would choose to write an entire ghazal about a woman's undergarment. Muhammad Husain Azad in Aab-e-Hayat, his critical study of Urdu poetry, compiles a list of Insha's work which also includes such eccentricities as a hunting poem about Saadat Ali Khan in Persian, satires complaining about heat and flies, a poem about a wedding of elephants, and a masnavi on the subject of cock-fighting. Apart from being an virtuoso poet, Insha was a linguist, who knew many Indian dialects intimately. He is known for two remarkable works which display aspects of this talent: Rani Ketki Ki Kahani, a short romance which is one of the earliest prose works in Hindi (no Arabic or Persian words are used), and Darya-e-latafat (1807), a work in Persian on the grammar and rhetoric of the Urdu language, which also presented a linguistic study of the dialects of Delhi and Lucknow. This pioneering work established grammatical terminology used to this day.

Life Siegfried Passarge was born in K√∂nigsberg, the son of travel writer Ludwig Passarge. He attended Frederick College, and after graduation studied geography in Berlin and Jena. He also trained in medicine, and worked as a doctor during his military service. In 1894 Passarge took part in an expedition to Adamawa, at the northern boundary of the former German colony of Cameroon., p.66 From 1896 to 1899 Passarge worked as a geologist and surveyor for the British West Charterland Company in South Africa, during which time he made extensive ethnographic studies of the Khoisan and Bantu. In 1901‚Äì1902 he took part in an expedition to the Orinoco, followed by travel in Algeria in 1906 and 1907. His travel memoirs record his experiences, including the violences he committed whilst in Africa. From 1904‚Äì1905 Passarge held the post of Associate Professor of Geography in Berlin and in 1905 he became Professor of Geography in Breslau. In 1908 he joined the Colonial Institute in Hamburg, where he worked until 1936. He theorised that it should be possible for geographers to set up a taxonomic system for landforms, in much the same way as the biological sciences, although he favoured an empirical, descriptive system rather than a genetic one. Passarge's theories of racial geography (expounded in the 1920s in Das Judentum als landschaftskundlich-ethnologisches Problem) were embraced by the Nazi Party after 1933. On 11 November 1933 he was among the signatories of the commitment of the professors at German universities and colleges to Adolf Hitler and the Nazi state.

Visitor accommodation at Shingwedzi Alexander Merensky's map of 1881 shows the unhealthy malarial flats and the range of the tsetse fly (in blue) encompassing much of the region. Shingwedzi (also Xingwedzi in modern Tsonga orthography) is a rest camp (i.e. tourist camp) and ranger's post situated in the northern section of the Kruger National Park. They are located on the southern bank of the Shingwedzi River, for which they were named, in Limpopo province, South Africa. The surrounding country formerly constituted the Singwitsi Reserve, proclaimed in 1903, which encompassed over 5,000 square kilometers. The region was over-hunted by the end of the 19th century, its big game depleted and its elephant population completely decimated. The name \\"Shingwedzi\\" is of Tsonga origin, and was perhaps derived from \\"Shing-xa- goli\\", perhaps a local chieftain, and \\"njwetse\\", the sound of iron rubbing against iron. History During the 19th century the area had only a small native population, as the presence of predators and tsetse fly prevented cattle husbandry. To the immediate east Soshangane established himself as overlord of the lower Bileni/Limpopo valley from 1827/28 to 1835, Omer-Cooper (1966:57), Elkiss (1981:62) displacing resident Tsonga people in clashes like the Battle of Xihaheni, while moving northwards. The rinderpest epidemic of 1896 however ravaged the region's buffalo population, and with it the tsetse fly, the vector of nagana or sleeping sickness. Some now looked at the region for its economic prospects. By the end of the 19th century this remote northeastern part of South Africa was the abode of poachers, illegal loggers, illegal prospecters and illegal recruiters of black labour from across the border. In December 1902, Leonard Ledeboer, a Zoutpansberg resident who had switched sides during the war, suggested the establishment of a reserve to sir Godfrey Lagden of the Department of Native Affairs. The Administrative Proclamation No. 19 of May 1903 which established the Singwitsi Reserve, also brought an end to the lawless exploitation of the region. The reserve boundary went from the Groot and Klein Letaba confluence in a straight line north to Shikumdu Hill, turning northeastwards to the Levuvhu and Crook's Corner. From the Limpopo it ran south along the Portuguese border to the Olifants, and west along the Letaba to the aforementioned confluence. The remote and beautiful reserve could boast with hills topped by baobab trees, dramatic gorges, including Lanner Gorge, lush riparian vegetation, plains with impressive mopane trees, and flood plains adorned with ilala palms and fever trees. =First rangers= Major James Stevenson-Hamilton was warden of the Sabi (since 1902) as well as Singwitsi Reserves. During his inspection tour of Singwitsi during September and October 1903, Stevenson-Hamilton found that game was scarce. He was nevertheless delighted with the region and found it 'well worth protecting'. Besides the relics of hunting camps there were numerous small African homesteads, the occupants of which subsisted on trapping and hunting by bow and arrow. The scarcity of game he however attributed to systematic hunting by Boer hunters, who were in his opinion doing more damage in a week than the Africans in a year. They had apparently exterminated all the elephant, rhino and eland during the war, and regarded game laws and ordinances as \\"waste paper\\", while having \\"no sporting instincts and no sense of honour as a rule\\". From 1904 to 1919 major A. A. Fraser was his only ranger in Singwitsi. The eccentric, red-bearded Fraser was recruited from Scotland as ranger for the small Pongola Reserve (dissolved in 1921), before he was transferred to Malunzane (also Malundzane) in Singwitsi. This deserted base of a former labour recruiter became Fraser's ranger post. It consisted of five rondavels on the bank of the Shongololo stream, not far from the present Mopani rest camp. Fraser was a poor administrator however, considering office work 'undignified', and was besides a poor manager of his native staff. He also developed poor relations with government officials of the district. An additional ranger, J. J. Coetsee, arrived in 1919 from East Africa. He established his ranger's post at the foot of Dimbo Kop in the far north. This he named Punda Maria, perhaps a playful corruption of phande mariha (or \\"border of the winter\\"), the alleged Venda appellation for this region. When Stevenson-Hamilton returned from Sudan to South Africa in 1920, he observed that a depressing retrogression had occurred in terms of discipline, management and faunal preservation in both the Sabi and Singwitsi Reserves. =Merged with Sabi Reserve= In expectation of a government buyout of the land in these reserves, the Singwitsi and Sabi became the Transvaal Game Reserve in 1923, then still privately owned to a large extent. Deneys Reitz, Minister of Lands from 1921 to 1924, and his successor Piet Grobler, advocated the fulfillment of 'Paul Kruger's dream', and the Kruger National Park was established in 1926. The persons involved in the Kruger Park's creation, the extent of their contributions and their political motives are matters of debate, but may be seen as the culmination of various protectionist movements and many strands of thought. By 1932 a good dirt road linked Letaba, Shingwedzi and Punda Maria for the first time, but this road was only accessible to tourists during the winter months. Camp facilities Shingwedzi's 31 tourist huts were completed in 1933, but these were only enclosed by a fence much later. Construction of Punda Maria's tourist huts was likewise undertaken during the same year. Current accommodation of Shingwedzi camp consists of 66 bungalows, 12 huts, 1 family cottage and 1 guest house, besides 50 camping sites. A new administrative complex was added in 1982/3, then outside the camp, and the A-circle huts were upgraded to bungalows. A landing strip is situated just south of the camp. The Kanniedood dam was constructed 9km downstream of the camp in 1978, but was demolished 40 years later, in 2018, in line with a rehabilitation project which aims to limit artificial water points for animals. The artificial supply of water in a naturally dry region caused erosion and environmental degradation. Rare herbivore species such as roan suffered due to increased grazing competition by abundant grazers, and from predation by lions which likewise expanded their territories. =Hiking trail= The Mphongolo Backpack Trail starts from Shingwedzi Camp, but doesn't follow a specific route. It enables small groups of visitors to explore areas like the Mphongolo River, Bububu River, Phonda Hills, sodic pans or stone-walled ruins. Rains and floods The Shingwedzi River flows only during the summer months, and diminishes to shrinking pools in winter. Heavy rains are normal at the start of each year, which may affect tourist roads, bridges, picnic spots and bush camps. On 24 February 2000 the Shingwedzi River reached record levels when cyclone Leon‚ÄìEline struck the northern lowveld. These levels were surpassed on 20 January 2013 when Shingwedzi and Sirheni camps were completely submerged by flood water after 400 mm of rain in a week caused the Mphongolo and Shingwidzi Rivers to burst their banks. 262 people were evacuated on the 20th and airlifted to safety the next day. Some staff were trapped as roads became submerged and survived by taking shelter in trees or on roofs. Some staff and tourists lost all their belongings, and the cost of rebuilding was over R150 million. The camp was reopened for tourists in June 2013. Fauna and flora The camp is situated in elephant country, and breeding herds of 50 to 60 animals frequent the vicinity. The tusks of a local elephant bull named \\"Shingwedzi\\" are now displayed in the museum at Letaba. \\"Shingwedzi\\" died in 1981 near the camp, and was one of the so-called \\"magnificent seven\\" that roamed the park during the 1970s and 80s. Other Afrotheria which are sparsely resident include the aardvark, Petrodromus, two Elephantulus species and the golden mole. Two species of hyrax are allopatrically distributed, namely the yellow-spotted hyrax which occurs commonly along the northern bush-clad hills and sandstone outcrops, and the rock hyrax, which occurs patchily southwards of the Bubube and Shingwedzi Rivers, but no further south than the Olifants. Ranger D. Swart reported seeing a group of 6 bat-eared foxes near Shingwedzi in 1967, a species previously thought to be restricted to the western parts of southern Africa. Further sightings in 1967 and 1969 confirmed their presence. Anthrax, caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis, is endemic to the area, and causes sporadic outbreaks. It affects mainly ungulates, but also carnivores and humans. As anthrax inhibits blood clotting, the blood of deceased animals seep into the soil. The spores survive for decades in substrates with elevated calcium content or neutral-to-alkaline pH levels. The immediate vicinity of Shingwedzi camp contains some riparian vegetation with large trees, and narrow alluvial plains created by centuries of flooding, flank the river on each side. Here Transvaal mustard trees, weeping boer-bean, sausage tree, Natal mahogany and brack thorn may be found, but further afield the land is dominated by mopane shrub, punctuated by apple-leaf trees. Land claim In 1905 chief Sundhuza Mhinga and his Mhinga clan were dispossessed of their land in this area, and moved to land west of the park. In 1999 chief Shilungwa Mhinga claimed all land in the park north of the Shingwedzi River, and intended to use the southern portion for ecotourism hotels and other parts for lodges. Land restitution legislation however assists only those dispossessed since 1913, so as to avoid conflicting claims.

Trained by vocal teacher Clara Novello Davies, Dyer was famed for singing to audiences after he had fought in a contest and was nicknamed 'The Singing Boxer'. In 1913 Dyer was briefly Wales welterweight champion when he beat Jack Delaney, who won the belt back just six weeks later. During his professional career Dyer took two overseas tours, to Australia from 1914 to 1915 and the United States from 1916 to 1919. Due to the time spent in Australia, he became eligible to contest for national titles, unsuccessfully challenging Les Darcy for the welterweight belt in 1915. The highpoint of his time in America, then during the 'no decision' era, was a win over Panama Joe Gans. Due to a knee injury, Dyer was refused active service during the First World War; instead he was recruited into the United States Army as a boxing instructor. After retiring from fighting Dyer ran various boxing gyms in London, successfully managing British flyweight champion Bert Kirby. Dyer then became a physical culture coach and was at the forefront of a diet fad in the 1920s based on fruit and vegetable drinks. Little is known of his life after the Second World War and he faded into anonymity. History =Early life= Dyer was born in 1888 in Cardiff, Wales to a Welsh mother and Irish father. Dyer's mother came from a musical background and was a member of the Royal Welsh Glee, while his father was a bare knuckle boxer. Dyer showed promise as a baritone singer and was trained by Clara Novello Davies, mother of Ivor Novello. He was also an impressive sportsman, as a swimmer and, like his father, a boxer; but his family's poverty decreed that he took up boxing over his singing to provide an income. Dyer fought in the travelling show booths for quick money, but when this was discovered by the amateur boxing association, it led to him being stripped of his amateur status, which in turn saw his hopes of competing at the 1908 Summer Olympics in boxing and in swimming dashed. =Professional career= Welsh title Dyer turned professional in either 1909 or 1910. Boxrec record his first fight in July 1909 against Jack Delaney, a boxer who Dyer would challenge in 1913 for the Wales welterweight title. Boxing magazine reported in January 1910 that his fight against future British and European welterweight champion Johnny Basham was Dyer's debut fight. Both fights are recorded as victories for Dyer, but the fight against Basham, held in Newport on New Year's Day 1910, was reportedly held back to late at night to allow Dyer to fulfill matinee and evening singer engagements in Stoll's Panopticon in St. Mary's Street, Cardiff. Dyer was a popular choice with boxing promoters, helped by the fact that after each bout he would sing Thora, a popular hit of the day to the audience. His careers as a pugilist and baritone earned him the nickname, 'The Singing Boxer'. His first few bouts were all held in south Wales, but by the autumn of 1910 he was travelling to England to fight, and on 10 October 1910 he was invited to fight at the National Sporting Club in Covent Garden, London. On 15 May 1911 Dyer was scheduled to fight Dick Emden at The Ring in Blackfriars, London. To date, Dyer had recorded over 15 bouts and was unbeaten but the fight with Emden ended in defeat and affected his future boxing career. Dyer was easily ahead in the bout, when in the fifth round he dislocated his knee and fell to the canvas in agony. Emden, who taunted the fallen Dyer, was given the victory and Dyer would not fight for another six months. The injury to his right knee plagued Dyer throughout his entire boxing career, and also stopped him serving in the armed forces during the First World War. After the injury, Dyer always fought with a protector strapped around his knee, and was forced to change his fighting style. He would always stand on the toes of his right foot, as a quick back step could possibly dislocate his knee again. His return bout in November 1911 was a win against Young Lilley at The Ring, but this was again followed by a long absence. Dyer did not fight again until 1 June 1912. On 7 July 1913 Dyer faced Jack Delaney for the vacant Wales Area Welterweight title, despite Delaney being English. The fight was staged at the Skating Rink on Westgate Street in Cardiff and was scheduled for 20 rounds. The fight went the distance and Dyer was awarded the bout on points decision, making him the Welsh welterweight champion. He held the title for just over a month when a rematch for the title ended in victory for Delaney. Despite the loss, a win over Gus Platts‚Äîwho would later become British and European middleweight champion‚Äîin October resulted in Dyer being touted as one of the preferred challengers to the British welterweight champion Johnny Summers. Summers though had travelled to Australia to extend his boxing campaign, and in the spring of 1914 Dyer decided to follow him abroad to challenge for his title. Dyer stopped off en route in South Africa to play music halls in a bid to help pay his fares. Dyer entertained with a mixture of songs and shadow boxing, and challenged all- comers to fight with him at the end of the show. Unfortunately for Dyer, by the time he reached Australia, Summers had already returned to Britain. Australia Despite missing Summers, Dyer decided that the trip to Australia should not be wasted and began his own campaign. As in Britain, his note as a singer preceded him, and at several venues he would sing as well as box. His first fight, in May 1914, was at the Athletic Pavilion in Melbourne against Knucker Pearce. The six round fight went the distance in Dyer's favour. On 17 October 1914 he easily beat Sol Jones in a 20-round fight that went the distance, which was followed by a contest with American fighter Fritz Holland. Holland had arrived in Australia in 1914, and had already beaten English fighter Tom McCormick and local wonderkid Les Darcy. The fight with Holland took place at Baker's Stadium, where Dyer had beaten Jones just the month before. The 20 round contest went the full distance, but when the referee declared the fight a draw there was uproar from the spectators who considered Dyer the winner. This was backed up by press representatives who had scored 16 of the rounds in favour of Dyer. Dyer's display against Holland brought about a contest with Les Darcy, the \\"Maitland Wonder\\". After their first contest was delayed when Darcy was detained in quarantine in Sydney, a contest was arranged for Boxing Day at Baker's Stadium. At the start of the fight, Darcy weighed in at 11 st 1 lb, while Dyer's weight was not announced beforehand, but in the after-fight weighing, it was recorded as 10 st 2 lbs.Although it is reported in some publications (Jones 2009), that Dyer was giving away nearly a stone in weight, Dyer's recorded weight was taken after the fight of 20 3-minute rounds and Dyer would have lost weight during the fight (4lbs is estimated by the Brisbane Courier at the time). This would still have given Darcy a significant weight advantage of roughly seven pounds. Before the bout Dyer was sporting a black-eye sustained in sparring and his knee strapped, which he always did after his dislocating the knee in 1911. Darcy started the fight in a flurry in an attempt to finish the contest quickly, but after little gain both fighters settled into a more evenly paced bout. The contest went the distance and the referee gave the victory to Darcy, which was seen as a fair result. While in Australia, as in South Africa, Dyer attempted to supplement his boxing income by arranging singing contracts at music halls and theatres, though his attempts to find work at the Tivoli Theatre in Sydney were unsuccessful. During his time in Australia Dyer was involved in exhibition work and was one of the boxers present at the opening of a new stadium at the Broadmeadows Training Camp for soldiers in Melbourne. Dyer's attempts to continue his boxing career stumbled during this period. A match was arranged with local butcher Jimmy McNabb, but McNabb then switched his fight to face Holland instead, though Holland's team promised to give Dyer a fight with fellow American Jimmy Fitton, but that too fell through. A further fight was arranged with Belgian fighter Henri Demlen, but an injury to Demlen ending the encounter. In March 1915 Dyer put his boxing on temporary hold and spent some time in New Zealand, performing on the Brennan-Fuller vaudeville circuit. Eventually a bout was secured with Victoria middleweight champion Ed Williams, and the two met at the newly built West Melbourne Stadium on 29 May 1915. Despite being the lighter boxer, Dyer outpointed Williams from the fourth round of the fight and won by knockout in the ninth. Just a week after defeating Williams, a rematch was announced between Dyer and Holland. The fight venue was Rushcutters Bay Stadium in Sydney and both fighters turned out for a training exhibition in the build-up to the contest. The contest, held on 5 June 1915, was watched by a crowd of 2,000 spectators. The fight went the full distance and in the closing rounds Holland, realising that his only chance of victory was a knockout, attacked Dyer ferociously, staggering the Welshman in the 19th. Despite the late assault, Dyer stayed on his feet and was announced the winner by the referee. After the Holland fight, Dyer made several attempts at a rematch with Darcy, reportedly to the exclusion of other fights, in the belief that the encounter would draw a big crowd and a large purse. The postponed fight with Delmen was again mooted, but this too never occurred. In the meantime Dyer continued to busy himself with charity work, setting up a boxing fund for injured soldiers in Sydney, and continued to tour the vaudeville circuit in New South Wales. Dyer's persistence eventually paid off, and an encounter with Darcy was arranged for 9 October at Rushcutters Bay Stadium, with the Middleweight Championship title at stake. The fight was a one-sided affair, with Dyer outclassed throughout. Although Darcy was warned for a low blow in the fourth round, Dyer was never in the fight and his corner threw in the towel after one minute of the sixth round. Dyer's final fight in Australia was a challenge for the Australian Welterweight title, held by Melbourne fighter Fred Kay. Due to the fact that Dyer had been a resident in Australia for over a year he was now allowed to challenge for the Australian belts. The fight was held on 6 November 1915 and was scheduled for 20 rounds. Initially it appeared that Dyer would win the title comfortably, out-scoring the champion for most of the early rounds. Dyer then connected cleanly with Kay's nose at the start of the eighth, putting Kay down for a count of eight. When Kay rose he was bloodied and spent much of the round in defence, but by the ninth Kay had recovered and was now the aggressor. In the eleventh round Kay caught Dyer with a powerful body shot that put him down for the count. Dyer's corner called a foul blow, but the ring doctor could find no evidence and Kay retained his belt. United States By the end of 1915 Dyer was through with Australia, the New Zealand Truth reporting that he had left by 4 December, and by Christmas Eve the American press were already announcing his arrival in the States. In January, Dyer was in San Francisco, where he fought local boxer Bob McAllister, losing on points in a four-round contest. He then travelled to the East Coast and to New York, and on 6 May 1916 he was back in the ring, in a ten-round fight with local boxer Tommy Maloney. The fight went the distance ending in a draw, though local newspapers gave the decision to Maloney.During this period of American boxing, in most states, only fights which ended before the full distance were given a decision on the night: knockout, technical knockout, retirement or no contest. Any fight that ended with all rounds being fought was declared a draw and no further decision was made by the referee. The ultimate decisions of these drawn fights (win, loss or draw) were declared by the sports pages, whose results are historically accepted. After the fight Dyer entertained the crowd with an operatic song. Dyer continued to box regularly in New York State losing to Frankie Notter in June and then recording a draw with George Ashe in July.The New York Evening Telegram (Paul Zabala) gave the decision to Ashe while the Brooklyn Daily Eagle reported a win for Dyer. Dyer appears to have forgone fighting for over a year, but then returned to the ring in July 1917, both contests held at the Rochester Airdome. He was given his first win since arriving in America in his encounter with Willie Langford but this was followed by another loss, this time to Bryan Downey. On 28 September 1917, Dyer fought in Boston, Massachusetts, facing local fighter Tommy Robson, in which the referee declared a draw. His next fight, against Frankie Maguire in Pennsylvania, was given to Dyer by the Philadelphia Record after the fight went the distance. Dyer's next fight was against Lew Williams, which was given to Williams by the New York Evening Telegram, though The New York Sun believed Dyer shaded the match with more precise punching. On 3 November 1917, A fight with Panama Joe Gans was arranged. The fight was held at the Clermont Avenue Rink in Brooklyn, location of his last two contests, the loss to Williams and then a win over Young Battling Nelson. Dyer easily outpointed Gans and was awarded the decision by several New York papers. The win over Gans caused some members of the press to talk of Dyer as a challenger for welterweight title holder Ted \\"Kid\\" Lewis, the London boxer who was then based in America. A match was made but Lewis injured a finger and the match was called off. By the time Lewis was fit he had lost his title to Jack Britton, and Britton was not interested in fighting Dyer. Dyer fought twice more in New York in 1917, avoiding the newspaper decisions with a knockout win over Kid Queens and then a technical knockout of Kid Carter. Dyer in military uniform during his time at Camp Grant In late 1917 Dyer faced Tommy Robson again in two encounters in Massachusetts. The first, fought in Boston, was a disputed result after the bout went the distance, though it is recorded as a win for Robson. The second match, at Cuddy's Arena in Lawrence, was intended to be between Robson and Ted Lewis, but when Lewis could not fight, Dyer stepped in. This second bout also ended in a newspaper decision for Robson. Despite fighting for twelve rounds against Robson, Dyer entertained the crowd after the fight by playing his ukulele and singing popular songs. As in Australia, Dyer continued to appear at charity events in aid of the war effort. In January 1918 he appeared as part of a fundraiser for the basketball team The Newark Elks, who had several players fighting in Europe. Headlining the bill was world boxing champion Benny Leonard. On 1 February 1918 Dyer was awarded a points victory over Frankie Mack in Boston, which he followed up with another win this time over Terry Brooks. At the start of the Brooks fight, as Dyer was getting into the ring, he was handed a telegram informing him that he had been appointed as a boxing instructor for the National Army. Dyer had been refused admission into the British and American Armies on account of the broken cartilage in his right knee. Dyer was eventually based at Camp Grant in Illinois, but fought one more bout, a win over Walter Butler of Boston before beginning his commission. Dyer did not fight outside the armed forces during the rest of the war, but he proved successful in his role as camp boxing instructor with Camp Grant performing well in boxing tournaments. Dyer also continued his charity work, singing and boxing in front of the public and the armed forces. With the end of the war, Dyer returned to civilian life. His first fight outside the army was against local boxer Tommy Ferguson at the Town Hall in Scranton, Pennsylvania. The Scranton Times gave the decision to Ferguson, though the Evening Public Ledger gave every round to Dyer. Just a day later this was followed by a decisive loss to Eddie Trembley in Jersey City. Dyer then finished with his third fight within the week by facing Joe Egan on 18 February, a late substitute for Paul Doyle. Dyer lost by points decision. After defeating Young Battling Nelson again, in a rematch set in Binghamton, Dyer lost on points a week later to Wisconsin fighter Pal Reed. He continued to appear at charity contests in the early half of 1919, mainly for the Boxers' Loyalty League, sparring with the likes of Tim Healy and Silas Green. By now Dyer's vaudeville bookings were far outnumbering his boxing appearances and in the latter half of 1919 he faced only a handful of opponents in paid boxing matches. These included a newspaper decision loss to Steve Latzo in May and a win over Johnny Evans in New Jersey in July. Between August and September Dyer was part of a touring boxing show organised by the Knights of Columbus, fighting for the entertainment of returned and injured soldiers. Dyer fought a few more professional bouts in America, a draw and a loss to Joe Egan and a newspaper decision win over Jimmy Gray, but by 1920 Dyer had left the country and had returned to Europe. Career end When Dyer returned to Europe he initially travelled to France, where he sang and played to theatres in Paris. Only one boxing match is recorded during his time there, against middleweight Jean Audouy. Before the fight Dyer was advised by a doctor not to wear his strapping he had used to support his injured left leg, but in the seventh round his leg gave way again and Audouy was declared the winner. Just a week before his encounter with Audouy, Ted Lewis had regained his British middleweight title but Dyer's reoccurring injury now ruled out any encounter between the fighters. By July Dyer was back in Britain and was fit enough to re-enter the ring, stopping Nicol Brady via technical knockout in a contest in Wallsend. He followed this with a points decision over Jack Zimmer and then won through Will Brooks' disqualification in a contest held in Cardiff. In November 1920 Dyer was invited to the National Sporting Club in London to face 'Bermondsey' Billy Wells. During the bout the referee twice instructed both men to make a proper contest of the fight. The referee let the match go the full fifteen rounds and then, instead of declaring a winner, he called the fight a 'no contest', with the fighters' purse being given to charity. After the National Sporting Club debacle, Dyer turned more and more to his singing and very few fights are recorded after 1920. A fight against Jim Slater in January 1922 is believed to be his last bout.BoxRec, although an incomplete source, states \\"Apparently this was Dyer's last fight. He spent most of his time on stage, and boxing seems to have never been more than sideline for him\\" =Later life= After retiring from boxing, a decision forced on him by his ailing knee, Dyer focused on his theatre appearances. His voice though, was not as it once was, and he strained to reach the higher notes of his range and bookings began to dry up. Dyer then refocussed on boxing, but this time as a manager. In the 1920s he moved to London, where he set himself up as a physical culture expert and ran a small stable of fighters. The three fighters training under him were Bristolians George Rose and Reggie Hobbs and most notably Bert Kirby from Birmingham. Kirby went on to become the British flyweight champion when he took the title from Jackie Brown in 1930. Dyer also ran a gym for gentleman on the Strand, which was used by fighters such as Bantamweight champion Teddy Baldock and American Packey McFarland who Dyer faced when the two men were boxing instructors in the US Army. The gym was later demolished to make way for a new hotel and Dyer was forced to find a new location. Dyer took his role as a physical culture expert very seriously and insisted on managing the diet of his boxers. He was also at the forefront of a fad in the mid-1920s which was based on a diet of fruit and vegetable drinks, a lifestyle choice that he believed could cure all illnesses. Dyer continued in his career as a physical culture expert into the next decade and was still working out of London in that capacity in 1939. Dyer slowly slipped into obscurity, and his dealings after London, including his place and date of death, are unknown. Boxing record As there is no definitive date of when Dyer turned professional and many fights in the early 20th century were poorly recorded, the boxing record associated with Dyer is incomplete. His total bouts and results presently stand, as listed by Boxrec, as 72 fights, of which 44 were wins (14 by knockout), 20 losses (4 by knockout), 6 draws and 2 'no contests'. It is accepted that this list is incomplete and more bouts could be added in future, or changed. One commonly held misconception connected to Dyer is that he holds the second longest unbeaten record of fights of any boxer in world history, after fellow Welsh fighter Jimmy Wilde. This information was published in Nat Fleischer's The Ring: Record Book And Boxing Encyclopedia, in which it states Dyer fought 94 unbeaten fights between 1908 and 1912. Although it could be argued that Dyer may have boxed 94 fights between these years, and may have turned professional in 1908, it is widely accepted that his fight with Dick Emden in 1911 in which he dislocated his knee was a loss. This therefore challenges Fleischer's claim.

It also produces the dihydroisocoumarin mellein. It is a filamentous fungus in nature and has characteristic biseriate conidiophores. Traditionally a soil fungus, has now began to adapt to varied ecological niches, like agricultural commodities, farmed animal and marine species. In humans and animals the consumption of this fungus produces chronic neurotoxic, immunosuppressive, genotoxic, carcinogenic and teratogenic effects. Its airborne spores are one of the potential causes of asthma in children and lung diseases in humans. The pig and chicken populations in the farms are the most affected by this fungus and its mycotoxins. Certain fungicides like mancozeb, copper oxychloride, and sulfur have inhibitory effects on the growth of this fungus and its mycotoxin producing capacities. History and related species The genus Aspergillus was first described in 1729 by Pier Antonio Micheli. Under this genus the species Aspergillus ochraceus was discovered by the German botanist and mycologist Karl Adolf Wilhelm in 1877. After this discovery, some other species that looked similar to Aspergillus ochraceus were considered synonyms of this fungus. For example, Aspergillus alutaceus isolated by Berkeley in 1875, Sterigmatocystis helva isolated by Bainier in 1881, Aspergillus ochraceus var. microspora isolated by Traboschi in 1908, and Aspergillus Ochraceus- petali- formis isolated by Balista et Maia in 1957 are all considered synonyms of Aspergillus ochraceus. In 1979 two new species under the Aspergillus ochraceus group were discovered. Aspergillus bridgeri was isolated from soils collected in southcentral Wyoming and Aspergillus campestris from northcentral North Dakota. Physiology The colonies of Aspergillus ochraceus grow rapidly (45 to 55 mm in 7 days). The optimum temperature for their growth is 25 ¬∞C. In an agar plate the vegetative mycelium is mostly submerged in the agar, while the conidial heads are typically arranged in zones. The characteristic colour of the colony is yellow. Some colonies of Aspergillus ochraceus form pinkish to purple, irregular, pebble-like sclerotia up to 1 mm in diameter. The reverse look on a petri dish is pale to brownish. To the naked eye, the conidiophores of Aspergillus ochraceus appear as a powdery mass. Microscopically, smooth or finely roughened phialides are arranged on the conidial heads in a biseriate fashion (i.e., phialides are attached to intermediate cells called metulae, which in turn are attached to the vesicle). The metulae all around the perimeter grows in a radial orientation. In culture the conidial heads at first appear globose, but with age, the conidial chains adhere and develop into two or three divergent columns. Vinaceous purple sclerotia may be present. The characteristic colour of the conidiophores is chalky yellow to pale yellow-brown. The heights of the conidiophores are up to 1500 ¬µm high. The appearances of these conidiophores are granular with pale yellow-brown walls that attach abruptly to a \\"globose to subglobose vesicle\\". The vesicles, which are globose with thin walls and a diameter of 35 √ó 50 ¬µm, produce sterigmata over the entire surface in culture. The primary sterigmata measures 15-25 √ó 5-6 ¬µm, while the secondaries are 7-11 √ó 2-3.3 ¬µm. The conidia are arranged in dry, upright chains, often massing into two or more short columns per head, in wet microscopic mounts hyaline. The diameter of the conidia are around 2.5-3.5 ¬µm. Aspergillus ochraceus produces a mycotoxin named ochratoxin A (OTA). Mellein and 4-hydroxymellein are other toxic metabolites produced by this fungus. The alkaloid Circumdatin H was isolated from A. ochraceus. Ecology The ecological roots of Aspergillus ochraceus lay in the soil. This fungus was first isolated from varied soils. Evolutionary development has now well adapted Aspergillus ochraceus to occupy a great variety of environmental niches. It has been isolated from the marine alga Sargassum miyabei. This fungus has also been found in a wide variety of agricultural commodities like corn, peanuts, cottonseed, rice, tree nuts, cereal grains, and fruits. Similarly the presence of this fungus has been documented in coffee beans Apart from the actual colonies of fungi growing on substances, the toxins and metabolites produced by this fungus have also been found in a variety of places. For example, the mycotoxin OTA produced by this fungus was found to be present in airborne dust. Likewise, secondary metabolites of this fungus have been isolated from marine sponges. This fungus has also been found to be associated with the contamination of an edible caterpillar, named the phane worm. In terms of climate preferences, this fungus has been found to mainly colonise temperate and tropical geographical areas. Mycotoxin of importance in agriculture and farming Ochratoxin A (OTA), a mycotoxin produced by A. ochraceus, contaminates food and initiates apoptosis of plant cells. Significant loss in nutritive value and hazardous effect on the food chain are caused due to the same OTA toxin contamination in barley grains of Spain. OTA has been isolated from plant acquired foods products like cereal, vegetables, coffee, wine, liquorice and also animal acquired food products like pork and poultry. Apart from being found in human food products from farm animals, this fungus was also isolated from the poultry feed. Aspergillus ochraceus produces both OTA and Penicillic acid in poultry feed at optimum temperatures and moisture levels. Combinations of low temperature and moisture favored the growth of Penicillic acid, on the other hand combinations of high temperature and moisture favored the growth of OTA. In addition to poulty and agricultural products the harvesting of edible insects is also an important economic activity. The rural population of Botswana eat a caterpillar called 'phane worm'. As already mentioned above, this lepidopteran larva is often contaminated by A. ochraceus. So this fungus is also of economic importance in cultures that consume insects. Wineries are also subject to losses resulting from OTA contamination as a result of A. ochraceus grows on grapes, dried vine fruits and wine. Industrial use Aspergillus ochraceus was used for the industrial production of xylanase and Œ≤-xylosidase. In addition to producing enzymes, recently in a study done by Lee Ki in 2013, Aspergillus ochraceus was found to inhibit the growth of a Shiga toxin-producing bacteria called Escherichia coli (STEC) O157, implicating industrial use of this phenomenon to develop anti-bacterial drugs. In another study pertaining to the conversion of Xanthohumol, a prenylated chalconoid, which has antioxidant and anticancer properties, Aspergillus ochraceus was found to be able to convert it into a stronger antioxidant, increasing the compounds radical scavenging properties. The process of fermentation was found to be enhanced by the addition of Aspergillus ochraceus in the substrate mixture, which contained wheat bran and wheat straw liquor. The secondary metabolites of this fungus have shown to possess antibacterial activities that manifest the potential to inhibit human pathogens. For example, Œ±- Campholene aldehyde, Lucenin-2 and 6-Ethyloct- 3-yl- 2- ethylhexyl ester are the three secondary metabolites that showed antimicrobial effects against potential human pathogens. Effects of human consumption The consumption of OTA is found to have neurotoxic, immunosuppressive, genotoxic, carcinogenic and teratogenic effects in humans. Toxicological studies have shown OTA to have strong carcinogenic mycotoxin effects on the liver and kidney of humans. Renal failure in human subjects have been reported after the inhalation of OTA. In addition to organ damage after inhalation of OTA, cases of allergy development have also been found. A disease named allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, has been found to be caused due to the antigenic effects of Aspergillus ochraceus. Aspergillus ochraceus was found to be associated with the development of asthma in children too. Cases of occupational environmental hazards are also documented, due to the presence of this fungus in organic dust of poultry industry. The workers in the poultry farm, subjected to this contaminated organic dust suffer from lung inflammation and decreased pulmonary function. In addition to lung diseases, instances of Aspergillus ochraceus causing paranasal sinusitis have also been reported. Animal diseases A 4-year-old male mixed breed dog was diagnosed with ear discharge due to A. ochraceus otitis. But the dog was treated with oral itraconazole and topical miconazole, which cured the dog after three weeks of medication. In a study, to test the toxicity of OTA in rats, a different dietary dose of OTA was administered to male Fischer rats. Only chronic administration of OTA manifested as renal carcinogensis in these rats. Low levels of Aspergillus ochraceus contamination caused mycotoxic nephropathy in farm pigs and chickens from Bulgaria. Just as in Bulgaria, the mycotoxicoses produced by A. ochraceus is seen in chickens and other animals elsewhere. In this mycotoxicoses we see suppression of hemopoiesis, acute nephrosis, hepatic necrosis and enteritis. The mechanisms by which this fungus causes the nephrotoxicity in animals are cell apoptosis and lipid peroxidation. In the pig population this fungus has caused a number of diseases. Some of these diseased conditions are, subcutaneous edema, hydrothorax, hydroperitoneum, pulmonary atelectasis, edema of the mesentery and perirenal edema. The edema produced in these animals is so massive that ascites, hydrothorax, and hydropericardium develop, in addition to subcutaneous edena and mesenteric edema. Affected animals die within a few hours generally. In addition to these conditions, renal lesions have been reported, which consist of tubular degeneration, necrosis, hyaline tubular casts, interstitial fibrosis and tubular cell regeneration. Extensive interstitial fibrosis of the cortical labyrinth was another observation in the swine population. Bovine abortions have also been associated with A. ochraceus infection. Treatment and prevention Fungicides like mancozeb, copper oxychloride, and sulfur inhibit Aspergillus ochraceus growth at appropriate doses, temperature and time. These fungicides also decrease the capacity of this fungus to produce the mycotoxin OTA. Ozonated air can be used to prevent the growth of this fungus on foods products like sausages. In another study they found that, gamma irradiations are useful in the detoxification and inactivation of ochratoxin A (OTA). The ethonolic extracts from the bark of the tree Clausena heptaphylla, has shown to inhibit the growth of this fungus as well. Fatty acids methyl esters (FAMEs), extracted from Linum usitatissimum seeds, have been found to reduce the radial hyphal growth of Aspergillus ochraceus, even though slightly less than \\"Aspergillus flavus\\". In a very similar fashion, some essential oils extracted from aromatic plants, have shown to have fungicidal effects on Aspergillus ochraceus that colonized pulses. In animals too, attempts have been made to cure (OTA) toxicosis. For example, in the White Leghorn cockerel, chronic haematological damage caused by (OTA) exposure can be reduced by exogenous supplementation using a combination of L-carnitine and vitamin E. Recently an alcohol producing yeast strain, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was found to inhibit the growth of OTA. Transcriptional regulation of OTA biosynthetic gene was the inhibitory mechanism used by the bacteria to do so. Dietary exposure to OTA today is mainly a result of failures during processing and conservation procedures used by food industries. Improper agricultural technology, storage and transport practices as well as method of processing food are key checkpoints to avoid toxic consumption of OTA.

It is part of, along with the Fort Cavour and Umberto I and the Batteria Semaforo, the defensive positions of Palmaria. History and Description As with other coastal towers and lookouts of the Ligurian coast, the Scola Tower is part of a defensive system originally desired by the Senate of the Republic of Genoa in the 16th and 17th centuries for the purposes of protecting the coast and, consequently, the towns and villages. According to some studies, the tower may have been built in the early 17th century for an estimated cost of 56,000 Genoese liras, and was in response to new ballistic technologies which forced the Senate of Genoa to a rapid conversion of existing defensive sites and the creation of new ones. The tower is pentagonal in shape with an average wall thickness of about , which accommodates up to eight people (eight soldiers, including a captain and a master \\"bombardero\\") and ten cannons, and guards the Bay of Palmaria, Porto Venere and Lerici. During the Napoleonic Wars, it was at the center of a naval engagement on January 23, 1800 between the British and French fleets, and was damaged by the British through their efforts to remove the latter from the Gulf of La Spezia, leaving it in a state of total neglect for the first half of the 19th century. Used for target practice by the Marina Militare and scheduled for demolition in 1915, it was saved by catching the interest of Ubaldo Mazzini, a local official at the Ministry of Education, and it was eventually decided to convert the tower to a lighthouse. Between 1976 and 1980, the structure has undergone major restoration and consolidation of the perimeter wall.Isola Palmaria e Comune di Porto Venere Informazione Sostenibile.

At least five personal friends of Robert Burns were among the group of local gentleman, whose idea it was to form the club. Irvine in North Ayrshire is an old market town and port situated on the west coast of Scotland, approx 14 miles north of Ayr.World Burns Clubs Retrieved : 9 April 2012 History The Robert Burns statue on Irvine Moor. The Irvine Burns Club, originally formed in the Milne's Inn (now The Crown Inn) is now based in Wellwood House (known simply as 'Wellwood'), Eglinton Street, and has an unbroken history dating back to 2 June 1826. The club had twelve founding members of whom five were known to Robert Burns, and two were once his close friends. The original minute of the meeting reads: \\"The subscribers agree hereby to form, and do now form ourselves into a Committee for the purpose of establishing a Club, or Society for Commemorating the birth of Robert Burns the Ayrshire Poet ‚Äì and we agree to meet at an early day to get the preliminaries of the Club properly arranged.\\" The document is signed by John Mackenzie, M.D.; David Sillar, Bailie; William Gillies, Grain Dealer; John Peebles, Convener of Trades; James Johnston, Town Clerk; Robert Wyllie, Harbour Master; John Orr, Merchant; James Allan, Merchant (grocer); Maxwell Dick, Bookseller; William Shields, Senior, Merchant; John Fletcher, Surgeon; and Patrick Blair, Writer. Dr John Mackenzie, was the first club president. He had been a doctor in Mauchline, attended Burns' dying father at Lochlea in 1784 and married one of the \\"Mauchline Belles\\" before moving to Irvine in the capacity of personal physician to the Earl of Eglinton and his family. David Sillar, the first Vice-president, had been a friend of Burns since his teenage years, was a member of the Tarbolton Bachelors Club, became a grocer, and finally an Irvine Council Bailie.Irvine Burns Club In 1925 Provost Hogg arranged for the donation to the club of the councillor's chairs used by John Mackenzie and David Sillar in celebration of the club's centenary.Strawhorn, Page 186 The club meets monthly at its own premises, Wellwood House, and has a structure of a President and Vice-President, other office holders, Directors, and members. The year is centred on events such as the 'Annual Celebration' and the 'Wreath Laying' at the Irvine Moor Burns Statue during January, the Directors' Dinner in March, Founders Day in June, etc. The club is an active contributor to the community with regular opening times for visitors, Burns competitions, various events, visits by school pupils, musical entertainments, working co-operatively with other Burns clubs, etc. Wellwood House Burns family stained glass window at the Irvine burns Club.

Alexander Paterson had been a partner in Hunter's Bank; after its incorporation into the Union Bank, he and his son John continued as agents with them. Both served on the Irvine council, John from 1854, serving as Provost in 1873‚Äì78. John bought the previous house on this site in 1869 and in 1898, after his death, the house passed to his widow, Mrs Catherine Gillies Paterson, who, in 1904, acquired the adjoining property and built the present house. \\"Wellwood\\" passed to her daughter Annie, and then in 1934, to Annie's two surviving brothers, J Graham and Robert Paterson, who bequeathed it to Irvine Burns Club in 1955, subject to a life rent in favour of their housekeeper Miss McLean. Irvine Burns Club used the ground floor from 1963, and became the sole occupant in 1976. The building now houses a museum, with a Burns Room bearing unique murals, a large library, and a Concert Room. Wellwood has regular opening hours and free admission.Wellwood Irvine Burns Club Burns artefacts The Irvine Burns Club is one of the oldest continually existing Burns Clubs in the World and has an excellent collection of Burns artefacts, including the Kilmarnock Edition and Edinburgh editions of \\"Poems chiefly in the Scottish dialect\\", by Robert Burns. =Manuscripts= The club has six of the original manuscripts which Burns sent to John Wilson, printer, Kilmarnock, for his famous Kilmarnock Edition, published on 31 July 1786, namely ‚Äì The Twa Dogs, The Holy Fair, The Author's Earnest Cry and Prayer, The Address to the Deil, Scotch Drink and The Cottar's Saturday Night. These manuscripts were originally in the possession of Burns' friend Gavin Hamilton, a lawyer in Mauchline and the poet's landlord at Mossgiel Farm. They passed to a relative Hamilton Robinson, originally an apprentice in Hamilton's office, and his widow married Mr Alexander Campbell, the Burgher Kirk Minister (1809‚Äì1843) in Irvine. In 1837 Mr Campbell gave the manuscripts to Mr Patrick Blair a founder member of the club, for the Club. These poems are written on 17 folio sheets, seemingly the only surviving manuscripts of the Kilmarnock Edition. They have been inlaid in Dutch handmade paper, and secured between sheets of glass; each of the six volumes are bound in Levant Morocco leather. In 1888 they were selected for the Scottish Literature display at the Glasgow International Exhibition.Scottish National Memorials, Page 185 =Sketch= Rosslyn Castle entry bridge. Site of the sketch of Robert Burns by Alexander Nasmyth. The club owns one of two sketches, the other being in the National Galleries, made of Robert Burns in 1786 by Alexander Nasmyth when he visited Roslin Castle with the poet to enjoy the spectacle of the sunrise. This particular sketch was later used as the inspiration for a small full-length portrait in oils which Robert Chambers commissioned in 1827 and which was then engraved in 1837 for the Life of Burns by Lockhart.Mackay, Page 291 Nasmyth is said to have conceived of the pose used during the visit when burns was admiring the castle. Despite the diminutive size, this portrait is credited as the inspiration for many statues of the Robert Burns statues throughout the world.National Galleries of Scotland =Letters= The Club possesses two original letters from Robert Burns to his friend David Sillar, written from Ellisland Farm, Dumfriesshire, dated 5 August 1789, and 22 January 1790. The letters deal with Burns obtaining eleven subscribers for Sillar's own book of poems published in 1789. The club purchased these artefacts in 1975 from the Rev. David Sillar, Wetherby, Yorkshire, a great-great-grandson of Sillar. =Dr Fleeming's Day-Book= In 1956, 175 years after Burns was in Irvine, this unique artefact was found by Mr Charles Balcombe, a club member, in the attic of 49 Kirkgate, the former home of Dr Charles Fleeming.Mackay, Page 99 The entries for November 1781 include details of his treatment of Robert Burns, recorded as a \\"lint dresser, Irvine\\", showing that Surgeon Charles Fleeming (Fleming) had visited the Poet on five occasions in a period of eight days. The only surviving letter between Burns and his father relates to this episode and the depressed tone of its contents resulted in his father William travelling from Lochlie Farm, Tarbolton, to visit him.Mackay, Paage 100 =The Templeton Chair= In 2016 the chair that Robert Burns used whilst visiting Templeton's bookshop in Irvine was donated to the club by the Gilroy family. Mrs Gilroy's in 1930 stated that Burns' chair was carefully kept by Mrs McGavin (Templeton's daughter) and upon her death in 1881 Templeton's niece took charge of it. In 1909 Templeton's great-niece emigrated to Australia and took the chair with her as a precious family possession, saying that \\"the chair that Burns always used to sit in and, as Mrs McGavin used to tell my mother, many a good laugh and joke he had in it.\\"The Irvine Burns Club The Irvine Burns Club library The library at Wellwood House is composed of some 2,000 books donated and purchased over many years, divided into: Burns Works and Criticism; Burnsiana; General Literature and Poetry; Scottish History; Ayrshire History; All the works of John Galt (native of Irvine, 1779‚Äì1839); The works of James Montgomery (1771‚Äì1854) another native of Irvine who was known as a Christian poet; The works of Edgar Allan Poe, who spent some time at school in Irvine; Records of the local newspaper 'The Irvine Herald' from 1870; The five-volume set \\"Original Scottish Airs\\" (songs collected by George Thomson, FAS, Edinburgh) (New Edition 1826), donated to the Museum by Mrs W F Shankland of Kirkcudbright in 1987. The library holds a copy of Robert Burns Begg's (1891) \\"Memoir of Isobel Burns\\" that was privately printed for family members only. This rare edition was signed by the author, Robert Burns's nephew, and donated in memory of Sam Gaw, past president of the club and of the Robert Burns World Federation. Honorary membership Wellwood House and Eglinton Street. Detail of the President's Chain of Office medallion. Shortly after the Irvine Burns Club was founded in 1826, it was decided that prominent individuals, national and international, should be recognised by inviting them to become Honorary Members, with a proviso that each should write their letter of acceptance in their own hand. Local man, John Galt ‚Äì the novelist & Canadian pioneer together with James Montgomery, ‚Äì the \\"Christian Poet\\", to be honorary members. Both accepted the invitation by letter and thus began the tradition. Over the last 174 years over 250 letters have been collected, including James Glencairn Burns, the son of Robert, together with individuals represented in almost every field of human endeavour.World Burns Club Retrieved : 9 April 2012 The tradition has continued to the present day, including acceptance letters from Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher, sporting legends such as Roger Bannister, Jack Nicklaus, and Bobby Lennox, and many prominent Scots from different walks of life including JM Barrie, Sir Alexander Fleming, Jackie Stewart, Jimmy Shand, Winnie Ewing, each of the Scottish Parliament's four first ministers, and \\"19th Century literary giants such as Dickens, Tennyson, Browning, Thackeray, Longfellow, and Shaw, political figures from that era include Disraeli, Garibaldi, and Balfour.BBC News Retrieved : 9 April 2012 Burns scholar John DeLancey Ferguson accepted an honorary membership in 1962. The Loving Cups A central part of the annual Burns supper involves the ceremonial use of two loving cups, the first of which was presented by Sheffield Citizens in 1869 as a token of esteem and friendship to mark the purchase by the directors of the birthplace of James Montgomery, \\"The Christian Poet\\". He was a renowned newspaper editor, hymn writer, poet, journalist and lecturer. The second loving cup was given by David Sillar to his grandson William Cameron Sillar and was presented to the Irvine Burns Club by Mr. F. C. Sillar on 24 January 1964. Burns research The Irvine Burns Club encourages, promotes and facilitates research into Robert Burns, his family and topics related to his life, poetry, and songs. MacMillan's Publishing Alexander MacMillan (1818‚Äì1896) was born in Irvine. He was close to Burns in social class as his father Duncan Macmillan was an Ayrshire smallholder with a few cattle, who also worked as a carter, carrying coal from the pits to Irvine harbour. In 1845 the Macmillan brothers opened a bookshop and publishing firm in Cambridge, before Alexander moved what was by then, after the death of his brother, his publishing firm to London in the 1860s. His library contained an extensive collection of early Burns editions, mostly bound to match his first edition volume of the 'First Edition'.

It was founded in 1708, becoming the ninth church of its denomination established in Delaware with the help of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts. History Members of the Church of England settled in the area from around 1680, meeting in homes and later the courthouse. They petitioned the Bishop of London to send clergy to serve them and other churches in Sussex County; the first missionary arrived in 1708, but stayed for only a year. A permanent Sussex Mission was established by Rev. William Becket, who came to Lewes in September 1721 and remained until his death in 1743. Through his work, St. Peter's and three other churches flourished in Sussex County. He is buried in St. Peter's churchyard. It is not known exactly when the first church was built, although it was sufficiently finished to hold services when Becket arrived in 1721. In a letter of October 1728 to the Bishop of London, Becket describes St. Peter's Church as follows: : [It is] 40 feet in length 24 broad, the wall between the plate and the sill is 15 feet. The frame... Wood. the Roof... covered with Cypress Shingles and the wall with Boards of the same wood,.. the walls wainscoted with Cypress plank as high as the tops of the pews. The Pulpit, reading desk, Communion Table and Rail are handsomely built of Black Walnut ‚Äî the pews... of pine plank... the number of people frequenting this church I reckon... about 150. The original communion table is still in use as the altar in the present church. The church also has the original Book of Common Prayer used by the first congregation. In 1773 the church was presented a silver communion service made by John David, Silversmith of Philadelphia. It consists of four pieces, a flagon with domed cover for wine 10‚Äù high, chalice with removable cover 12‚Äù high, and a paten 10‚Äù in diameter. Each piece is inscribed ‚ÄúThe Gift of the Honorable John Penn Esq. To St. Peter‚Äôs Church in Lewis Town June 10, 1773.‚Äù The service is still used for communion on special occasions. John Marshall Phillips, Curator at Yale University, wrote that the Chippendale Period communion service was ‚Äúoutstanding‚Äù and ‚Äúthe finest silver in Delaware.‚Äù The silver has been exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum in New York, Christie's in London, and in other museum exhibits. Clergy for the church were supplied by the SPG until the American Revolution. St. Peter's survived the split with the Church of England, becoming part of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States in 1785. John Andrews, after being ordained Deacon of the Anglican Church in 1767, was appointed by the USPS as missionary of said church in which he honored for three years. A new church was constructed in 1808, about 30 or 40 feet to the south and west of the old church. On 15 September 1808, the Rev. James Wiltbank preached a sermon to the congregation in the completed building, which sat on the site of the present building. In 1848 it was decided to replace this building as well, as it was \\"much decayed and badly constructed for a house of worship.\\" In 1853 the old church was moved to the southwest corner of the churchyard on Third Street. Plans were purchased from a Philadelphia architect and on 27 May 1854, the Right Reverend Alfred Lee, Bishop of Delaware laid the cornerstone of the present building. The vestry asked Bishop Lee to consecrate the church in 1858, but the church was probably finished long before this, for Episcopal churches can only be consecrated when all debts have been paid. The steeple was added in 1870, and a sacristy and other rooms were added to the rear of the church in 1903.

He published a Surgical Dictionary which went through many editions. Biography Cooper was born in September 1780. His father, who had made a fortune in the West Indies, died when his three sons were still young. The eldest, George, became a judge of the supreme court in Madras, and was knighted. The second, Samuel, was educated by Dr. Charles Burney at Greenwich, and in 1800 entered St. Bartholomew's Hospital. In 1803 he became a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and settled in Golden Square. In 1806 he gained the Jacksonian prize at the College of Surgeons for the best essay on Diseases of the Joints. He then began writing about surgery, for which he achieved a reputation, with his books going to several editions. His book (1840) \\"First Lines of Theory and Practice of Surgery\\" was the first formal acknowledgement of advanced melanoma as untreatable. He stated that the only chance for a cure depends upon the early removal of the disease (i.e., early excision of the malignant mole.) More than one and a half centuries later, this situation remains largely unchanged. (London: Longman, Orme, Brown, Green and Longman) After his wife's death, Cooper in 1813 entered the army as surgeon, and served at the battle of Waterloo. Retiring on the conclusion of peace, he devoted his attention to editing the successive editions of his two principal works, and also gained a considerable surgical practice. In 1827 he became a member of the council of the College of Surgeons, and delivered the Hunterian oration in 1834. From 1831 to 1848 he was surgeon to University College Hospital and professor of surgery in the college. In 1845 he was elected president of the College of Surgeons, and in 1846 Fellow of the Royal Society. Cooper died of gout on 2 December 1848.

The film contains sequences in the order of appearance: a man seducing each of two trespassers in his apartment, a foursome on the rooftop, a threesome fantasy, a window voyeurism, and the subway scene.  Plot  Tony Stefano finds Steve Henson and Mike Raymond trespassing his apartment and seduces each of them respectively. Afterwards, Tony then goes to his bed and then fantasizes a threesome scene. Meanwhile, Mark Miller, Christopher Lance, Bill Joseph, and Kevin Luken are engaging an orgy on the rooftop of the apartment building. In the next scenario, Mike Raymond voyeurs at Tom Brock by the window, and they then engage each other. In the last scenario, Jim Pulver and Jeff Quinn hook each other up in an empty subway car.

The reviewer from Rad Video rated this movie four out of five stars and praised its sex scenes and male bodies but found its runtime too short.\\"Inch by Inch.\\" Alane Video. Web. 10 April 2012. Mark Adnum from Outrate called this film \\"a masterpiece of gay porn packed with great sex and hot guys\\". Both reviewers found its ending a tease to an upcoming sequel that never happened. In the book The Culture of Queers (2002), Richard Dyon called the subway scene a blend of \\"realism and 'classical cinema'\\". Dyon observed: the production setting of \\"the interior of subway carriage\\" appeared \\"clean\\" and less gritty than the actual interior of the subway, as the graffiti were \\"too legible and too appropriate to be true.\\" Nevertheless, he found sex performances of two men sexy, titillating, well shot and edited, and well-done signals of \\"abandonment and sexual hunger\\" as part of realism of anonymous sex. Director Matt Sterling picked two scenes of this film as his favorites for the compilation of Matt Sterling's accomplishments, Best of All: the window voyeurism scene of Tom Brock and Mike Raymond, and the subway scene of Jim Pulver and Jeff Quinn. In 1986, Inch by Inch won two Gay Producers Association Awards for the Best Video and Best Newcomer (Nick Eliot) and one Adam Film World award for the Gay Movie of the Year.

Career Horbowski-Zaranek (known in Germany simply as Vladimir Horbowski) was born in Tbilisi into a family of Polish and Ukrainian-Georgian nobles who left Russia and went into exile in Brussels in 1921 after the October Revolution. After studying at the Royal Conservatory of Brussels, he moved to Berlin, and was a pupil and assistant of Leonid Kreutzer. He was part of the circle of Ferruccio Busoni, which included Rachmaninoff. He later explained that he owed his most lasting artistic inspiration to these people. A highly gifted pianist in his youth, an accident denied Horbowski a career as a concert pianist, and he turned to the educational work. After Kreutzer was driven from his teaching post by the Nazi government in 1933 and emigrated to Japan, Horbowski took over the piano class at the Berlin Conservatory. From 1934 to 1945 Horbowski also headed piano classes at the Berlin Klindworth-Scharwenka Conservatory. He developed a teaching method that inspired his students to focus on learning the work by heart, and to concentrate primarily on phrasing, dynamics, pedaling and accurate attention to the score. He also pioneered a kind of finger movements which allowed to play complex pieces with lesser technical effort. After World War II, Horbowski took a position as professor of piano at the in Stuttgart. He taught material from Bartok's Mikrokosmos to concert literature. Pianists from around the world came to Stuttgart, to learn under his guidance the art of piano playing from a different angle. Numerous students won international competitions and awards, are known as concert pianists and are teaching at conservatories and music schools. Horbowskis served several times on the jury of the Queen Elisabeth Music Competition in Brussels, one of the world's most important music competitions. After his retirement, Horbowski moved to Munich, where he served as a teacher and adviser to many pianists. He died at the age of 85 after a long illness.

He also had the Reverend Mr Ferryman build a rustic hut at the bottom of the garden where Jenner treated the poorer families in the district.

At the time, evacuation was a controversial policy, and the film was produced with the aim of building support for it. Westward Ho! was the first of a series of five-minute propaganda films distributed weekly to cinemas between 1940 and 1942. Synopsis A group of schoolchildren from London are preparing for evacuation. After a medical examination, they meet at a railway station, uncertain of their destination. The train arrives and their journey to the countryside begins. Many of them have never seen the countryside before, and enjoy looking out of the carriage windows during the trip. Eventually, the children arrive at their destination, the Devon town of Torquay. After registration at a local school building, the children are handed over to the families who will be looking after them for the near future. The following day, the children write to their parents to inform them of their new addresses and begin settling into their new school classes. They also start to adjust to other aspects of life in Torquay, including working in the fields and playing on the beach. The film ends with a plea from mothers of other northern European countries, including Belgium and France. They urge British families to evacuate their children, wishing that they had had the same opportunity. Production The production of Westward Ho! marked the beginning of a new Ministry of Information programme of five-minute propaganda films. According to Sir Kenneth Clark, Controller of Home Publicity for the Ministry of Information, the aim was \\"to help people to remember government messages by putting them in dramatic form\\". These films were distributed free to cinemas once a week between 1940 and 1942, when the programme stopped. The project was initially placed under the leadership of Dallas Bower, who invited feature film director Thorold Dickinson to help create the inaugural production. The idea for the first film's subject came from a letter written to a newspaper from a mother who objected to evacuation. Westward Ho! was thus conceived as a way of showing the importance of evacuation, encouraging support for the policy and reassuring parents about the procedures that were in place. Production of the film was finished quickly, with the film receiving its premiere at the Dominion, on Tottenham Court Road, just two weeks after filming had begun. The total cost of the production was ¬£450.

The Derjaguin approximation (or sometimes also referred to as the proximity approximation) due to the Russian scientist Boris Derjaguin expresses the force profile acting between finite size bodies in terms of the force profile between two planar semi- infinite walls. This approximation is widely used to estimate forces between colloidal particles, as forces between two planar bodies are often much easier to calculate. The Derjaguin approximation expresses the force F(h) between two bodies as a function of the surface separation as : F(h) = 2 \\\\pi R_{\\\\rm eff} W(h), where W(h) is the interaction energy per unit area between the two planar walls and Reff the effective radius. When the two bodies are two spheres of radii R1 and R2, respectively, the effective radius is given by : R_{\\\\rm eff}^{-1} = R_1^{-1}+R_2^{-1}. Experimental force profiles between macroscopic bodies as measured with the surface forces apparatus (SFA)J. Israelachvili, Intermolecular and Surface Forces, Academic Press, London, 1992. or colloidal probe technique are often reported as the ratio F(h)/Reff. Quantities involved and validity The force F(h) between two bodies is related to the interaction free energy U(h) as : F(h) = - {dU \\\\over dh}, where h is the surface-to- surface separation. Conversely, when the force profile is known, one can evaluate the interaction energy as : U(h) = \\\\int_h^{\\\\infty} F(h') \\\\, dh'. When one considers two planar walls, the corresponding quantities are expressed per unit area. The disjoining pressure is the force per unit area and can be expressed by the derivative : \\\\Pi(h) = - {dW \\\\over dh}, where W(h) is the surface free energy per unit area. Conversely, one has : W(h) = \\\\int_h^{\\\\infty} \\\\Pi(h') \\\\, dh'. The main restriction of the Derjaguin approximation is that it is only valid at distances much smaller than the size of the objects involved, namely h ‚â™ R1 and h ‚â™ R2. Furthermore, it is a continuum approximation and thus valid at distances larger than the molecular length scale. Even when rough surfaces are involved, this approximation has been shown to be valid in many situations. Its range of validity is restricted to distances larger than the characteristic size of the surface roughness features (e.g., root mean square roughness). Special cases Frequently used geometries for the Derjaguin approximation. Two identical spheres, a planar wall and a sphere, and two perpendicularly crossing cylinders (left to right). Frequent geometries considered involve the interaction between two identical spheres of radius R where the effective radius becomes : R_{\\\\rm eff} = R/2. In the case of interaction between a sphere of radius R and a planar surface, one has : R_{\\\\rm eff} = R. The above two relations can be obtained as special cases of the expression for Reff given further above. For the situation of perpendicularly crossing cylinders as used in the surface forces apparatus, one has : R_{\\\\rm eff} = \\\\sqrt{R_1R_2}, where R1 and R2 are the curvature radii of the two cylinders involved. Simplified derivation Explanations concerning the derivation of the Derjaguin approximation for two identical spheres. Consider the force F(h) between two identical spheres of radius R as an illustration. The surfaces of the two respective spheres are thought to be sliced into infinitesimal disks of width dr and radius r as shown in the figure. The force is given by the sum of the corresponding swelling pressures between the two disks : F = \\\\int \\\\Pi(x) \\\\, dA, where x is the distance between the disks and dA the area of one of these disks. This distance can be expressed as x=h+2y. By considering the Pythagorean theorem on the grey triangle shown in the figure one has : R^2 = (R-y)^2+r^2. Expanding this expression and realizing that y ‚â™ R one finds that the area of the disk can be expressed as : dA = 2 \\\\pi r \\\\, dr = 2 \\\\pi R \\\\, dy = \\\\pi R \\\\, dx . The force can now be written as : F(h) = \\\\pi R \\\\int_h^{\\\\infty} \\\\Pi(x) \\\\, dx = \\\\pi R W(h), where W(h) is the surface free energy per unit area introduced above. When introducing the equation above, the upper integration limit was replaced by infinity, which is approximately correct as long as h ‚â™ R. General case In the general case of two convex bodies, the effective radius can be expressed as follows : \\\\frac{1}{R_{\\\\rm eff}^2} = \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{R'_{1}}+\\\\frac{1}{R'_{2}} \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{R_{1}}+\\\\frac{1}{R_{2}} \\\\right) + \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{R'_{1}}-\\\\frac{1}{R_{1}} \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{R'_{2}}-\\\\frac{1}{R_{2}} \\\\right) \\\\sin^2 \\\\varphi, where R'i and R\\"i are the principal radii of curvature for the surfaces i = 1 and 2, evaluated at points of closest approach distance, and œÜ is the angle between the planes spanned by the circles with smaller curvature radii. When the bodies are non- spherical around the position of closest approach, a torque between the two bodies develops and is given by : T = \\\\pi R_{\\\\rm eff}^{3} V(h) \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{R'_{1}}-\\\\frac{1}{R_{1}} \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{R'_{2}}-\\\\frac{1}{R_{2}} \\\\right) \\\\sin 2 \\\\varphi, where : V(h) = \\\\int_h^{\\\\infty} W(h') \\\\, dh'. The above expressions for two spheres are recovered by setting R'i = R\\"i = Ri. The torque vanishes in this case. The expression for two perpendicularly crossing cylinders is obtained from R'i = Ri and R\\"i -> ‚àû. In this case, torque will tend to orient the cylinders perpendicularly for repulsive forces. For attractive forces, the torque will tend to align them. These general formulas have been used to evaluate approximate interaction forces between ellipsoids. Beyond the Derjaguin approximation The Derjaguin approximation is unique given its simplicity and generality. To improve this approximation, the surface element integration method as well as the surface integration approach were proposed to obtain more accurate expressions of the forces between two bodies. These procedures also considers the relative orientation of the approaching surfaces.

London: Routledge, 1999, pp. 102‚Äì113. Print. Gilbert Moses recalls: \\"The Holmes County people came in from the farms to see us. We had to play in the afternoon because they wanted to get back home by dark.\\" For professional help in theater management the Free Southern Theater began working with professor Richard Schechner, then at Tulane University, who joined the theatre as one of its producing directors.Dent, p. 23. They toured rural Louisiana and Mississippi presenting plays such as Samuel Beckett‚Äôs Waiting for Godot. Initially consisting of both black and white actors, the company gradually became exclusively African-American and presented only plays by black playwrights such as the controversial LeRoi Jones (later known as Amiri Baraka). From the first, the company was plagued by artistic and managerial disagreements;Harding, p. 56. and, with free admission as a primary objective, money was always in short supply. Following their January 1965 tour, the company did fundraising performances in New York. Under financial duress and hoping to draw on a larger middle class black population, the troupe moved to New Orleans in 1965Dent, p. 53. where they purchased an office space and gathered a board of directors. The company went from eight members to twenty-three. In 1966 Moses, Schechner, and O‚ÄôNeal left, and the company was taken over by African-American poet and writer Thomas Dent assisted by Val Ferdinand (later known as Kalamu ya Salaam).Brief Biographies: Thomas Covington Dent Biography. The company launched workshops for actors and introduced plays written by their own members.Harding, p. 87. They adapted the play In White America by Martin Duberman to depict the murders of Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) field workers James Chaney, Michael Schwerner, and Andrew Goodman, killed in Philadelphia, Mississippi, by the Ku Klux Klan.Dent, p. 188. They also performed Waiting for Godot in whiteface.Dent, p. 190. and Ossie Davis's \\"Purlie Victorious\\".Dent, Schechner, Moses. But in spite of grants from the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations, and support from celebrities including Harry Belafonte, Arthur Ashe, Bill Cosby, and Julian Bond, The Free Southern Theater gradually lost its creative momentum and financial support. In 1980, The Free Southern Theater closed, however the 1985 production A Funeral for the Free Southern Theater: A Valediction Without Mourning, honored the company ‚Äúfeaturing a jazz funeral and a three-day conference of art for social change‚Äù. John O‚ÄôNeal‚Äôs theater company Junebug Productions strives to carry on the legacy of the Free Southern Theater. In addition to John O'Neal and Gilbert Moses, well known actors who appeared in FST productions included Roscoe Orman, and Denise Nicholas.The University of Southern Mississippi: Digital Collections.  Founding members  = Gilbert Moses = Gilbert Moses, a founding member of The Free Southern Theater and noted theater director, was born in Cleveland in August 1942. As a student at Oberlin College, Moses studied for a year at the Sorbonne in Paris before leaving school to join the civil rights movement. During his time in Mississippi, Moses served as a journalist for the Mississippi Free Press. New York Times theater critic Mel Gussow observes that an interest in the work of Jean Vilar and the Theatre National Populaire led Moses to pursue more \\"socially relevant theater\\". Following his involvement with The Free Southern Theater, Moses directed stage productions both on and off-Broadway. In 1969 Moses won an Obie Award for Amiri Baraka's 1969 play Slave Ship. Reflecting on a 1972 New York Times interview with Moses, Gussow observes how he \\"called for a deeper investigation of the lives of black people in the United States\\". He quotes Moses, ‚ÄúWe as blacks are starved for images of ourselves all over this country‚Äù. Moses died of multiple myeloma in April 1995. = Doris Derby = Born in either 1939 or 1940 in the Bronx, New York, Doris Derby‚Äôs long career has spread across a wide array of disciplines, ranging from theater to education. From an early age, Derby expressed strong interest in community activism and civil rights and joined a National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) youth group in the Bronx.Civil Rights History Project, US, Joseph Mosnier, and Doris Adelaide Derby. Doris Adelaide Derby oral history interview conducted by Joseph Mosnier in Atlanta, Georgia, 2011-04-26. Atlanta, Georgia, None , 4, 2011. Video. Retrieved from the Library of Congress, <https://www.loc.gov/item/2015669107/>. As a student at Hunter College in New York, Derby was a member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). The department of African American studies at Mississippi State University observes that the SNCC ‚Äúorganized voter registration drives, self help economic and educational initiatives and carried out protests at such places as segregated local, statewide and national governmental facilities, public movie theaters, parks, medical facilities and churches‚Äù. Derby‚Äôs work within the SNCC was centered, primarily, in New York, Georgia, and Mississippi. In Mississippi Derby taught adult literacy through the SNCC and helped found The Free Southern Theater. In 1990, Derby joined the faculty of Georgia State University and served as the founding Director of the Office of African American Student Services and Programs, as well as, Adjunct Associate Professor of Cultural Anthropology. A noted photographer, as well, Derby‚Äôs work has been exhibited at the Smithsonian Institution and the Bronx Museum of Art. Her documentary photographs are known to ‚Äúdepict the life of struggling Americans who defied the post-emancipation status quo brought about by political, economic, social and cultural domination and exploitation‚Äù. In 2012, Derby retired from Georgia State University following a successful 22 years of service. = John O‚ÄôNeal = Like fellow FST founder, Doris Derby, John O‚ÄôNeal worked for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in Mississippi as a field director. O‚ÄôNeal also served as national field program director of the Committee for Racial Justice. The recipient of the Award of Merit from the Association of Performing Arts Presenters and a Ford Foundation Award, O‚ÄôNeal has written eighteen plays, a musical comedy, poetry, and several essays. In 1980, The Free Southern Theater produced their final performance, a solo piece written and performed by O‚ÄôNeal titled Don't Start Me to Talking or I‚Äôll Tell Everything I Know. The play features the character Junebug Jabbo Jones, ‚Äúcreated by the SNCC members to represent and symbolize the wit and wisdom of common folk‚Äù. This performance marked the final production of the FST, but also signified the creation of O‚ÄôNeal‚Äôs new theater company, Junebug Productions. John O‚ÄôNeal currently serves as the Founding Director and Artistic Director Emeritus for Junebug Productions.  Notable productions  The first productions put on by the Free Southern Theatre were In White America and Waiting for Godot. These productions toured through the poor areas of the south, especially in Mississippi, where the company was founded. As part of their mission, the shows never charged an entry fee and performed in public places like churches and community halls. As mentioned in the History section, their production of Waiting for Godot was performed in whiteface since most of the cast was African American at the time. The theater also performed Purlie Victorious. In a New York Times article, a company member only referred to as \\"James\\" (James Cromwell, who played Pozzo) describes the enthusiasm that Godot received from the audiences in Mississippi.  Outreach  In addition to free performances throughout its existence, the Free Southern Theatre remained rooted in its Civil Rights roots. They had workshops for the community and college students at various stops on their tours, an acting apprenticeship, and a sponsorship program for local artists in Mississippi. Their partnership with the SNCC was essential for them to gain funding and support in order to continue their mission. The Free Southern Theater had to end its operations in 1980. Their mission did not entirely end, however, as Junebug Productions was formed in the shadow of the Free Southern Theater. This company is still working in several communities in the south in order to bring arts to areas that need it most. Their biggest project is the National Color Line Project in which the company travels and collects stories surrounding the Civil Rights Movement and uses them to archive history as well as bring new light to the current racial situation in the U.S. References ;Notes ;Sources * Dent, Thomas C.; Richard Schechner; Gilbert Moses; The Free Southern Theater by The Free Southern Theater: A Documentary of the South's Radical Black Theater with Journals, Letters, Poetry, and Essays, and a Play Written By Those Who Built It; New York; Bobbs-Merrill; 1969; ASIN B000H546Q2 * Free Southern Theater, \\"A General Prospectus for the Establishment of a Free Southern Theater, Jackson, Mississippi\\", Tulane University Online Exhibits, accessed November 21, 2016. * Harding, James Martin; Cindy Rosenthal; Restaging the sixties: Radical Theaters and their Legacies; Ann Arbor; University of Michigan Press, 2007; External links * Dent, Tom, and Jerry W.

Islamic extremism in Egypt has been the cause of much terrorism and controversy in the country in the 20th century, and still continues to be a main issue in the current Egyptian society. The main conflict between Islamic extremists and the government officials throughout history stems from two major issues: ‚Äúthe formation of the modern nation-state and the political and cultural debate over its ideological direction.‚ÄùKenney, Jeffery T. Muslim Rebels: Kharijites and the Politics of Extremism in Egypt. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006. Print. pg 56. Origins Islamic extremism has its roots in a sect of Islam called Kharijism, which came about around 600 CE when the third and fourth caliphs were murdered during the first civil war.Kenney, Jeffery T. Muslim Rebels: Kharijites and the Politics of Extremism in Egypt. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006. Print. pg 4. The Kharijites no longer exist today, and it did not continue as a sect of Islam, but their beliefs laid the early groundwork for much of what Islamic extremists believe today. During the time of their existence the name was understood as anyone who rebelled against the caliph or their appointer ruler, but overtime the name came to denote anyone of Islamist beliefs, or ‚Äúreligiously motivated militants.‚ÄùKenney, Jeffery T. Muslim Rebels: Kharijites and the Politics of Extremism in Egypt. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006. Print. pg 4,5 Much like the Islamic extremists today, the Kharijites ‚Äúgave themselves the right to judge who is a true believer of Islam and who is not.‚ÄùJabbour, Nabeel. The Rumbling Volcano: Islamic Fundamentalism in Egypt. Pasadena: Mandate Press, 1993. Print. pg 41. Also the Kharijites would eventually split into various sects, ‚Äúwhose common denominator was their claim that believers had to denounce‚Äù any Muslim leader who did not follow the Quran.Kepel, Gilles. Muslim Extremism in Egypt: The Prophet and Pharaoh. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. Print. pg 58. The ideals of Kharijism would continue to exist in the more modern sects that were formed, but the sect itself would not continue to exist like the Sunni or Shia.Jabbour, Nabeel. The Rumbling Volcano: Islamic Fundamentalism in Egypt. Pasadena: Mandate Press, 1993. Print. pg 31. 20th century =The Society of Muslim Brothers= During the 20th century, Egypt experienced several waves of revolutions to regain control of their nation from colonial rulers as to create a modern nation-state. Much of Egypt was Muslim at the time although there were significant numbers of Jews and Christians as well, but many of the political revolutions that Egypt experienced were centered on religions and how they related to politics. ‚ÄúThe result was an ideological conflict over the direction of the Egyptian nation, over who had the legitimate authority to determine the direction,‚Äù and ‚Äúby the 1930s a pattern of radical politics had taken hold across the Middle East.‚Äù Kenney, Jeffery T. Muslim Rebels: Kharijites and the Politics of Extremism in Egypt. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006. Print. pg 59, 60 In 1928, Hasan al-Banna founded the Society of Muslim Brothers, or Muslim Brotherhood, a prototype of the contemporary Islamic extremist movements.Kepel, Gilles. Muslim Extremism in Egypt: The Prophet and Pharaoh. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. Print. pg 22. At this time, the revolutions were causing outbreaks of violence rooted in the political upheaval, but the Brothers denied to view their position as anything but religious. Like the Kharijites before them, the Brothers firmly believed that the law could only follow the guidelines that God had set for them.Kenney, Jeffery T. Muslim Rebels: Kharijites and the Politics of Extremism in Egypt. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006. Print. pg 61. The Brotherhood rose to popularity through the 30s and 40s, and still had a significant membership in the 1950s, when Gamal Abdel Nasser began to rise to power. Nasser's influence Nasser and his party took control of Egypt in July 1953, and he quickly set out to destroy the largest branch of the Muslim Brothers.Kepel, Gilles. Muslim Extremism in Egypt: The Prophet and Pharaoh. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. Print. pg 26. By the end of 1954, Nasser‚Äôs goals to ‚Äúmobilize civic society‚Äù to create modern, independent Egypt, had ended the lives of several leaders of the Brotherhood while arresting or forcing the others into underground hiding.Kepel, Gilles. Muslim Extremism in Egypt: The Prophet and Pharaoh. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. Print. pg 26. For Nasser, ‚ÄúIslam could and should be politicized, as long as it remained subordinate to the state‚Äôs political purpose.‚ÄùKenney, Jeffery T. Muslim Rebels: Kharijites and the Politics of Extremism in Egypt. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006. Print. pg 69. Hoping that their political actions would be absolute, Nasser and Sadat would face the Islamist militants several more times in the coming decades. =Sayyid Qutb and Signposts= While detained in the Nasser regime‚Äôs concentration camps, the remaining members of the Muslim Brothers discussed and strategized new plans to take revenge on the secular enemy regime and Islamiscist thought was reconstructed.Kepel, Gilles. Muslim Extremism in Egypt: The Prophet and Pharaoh. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. Print. pg 27. One of the incarcerated members was a man by the name of Sayyid Qutb (1906‚Äì1966), who was being detained in the camp in the year 1957. He was so ‚Äúhorrified by the barbarism of the camp guards‚Äù who brutally massacred twenty-one inmates who refused to do labor for fear of dying that he ‚Äúbelieved the guards and torturers had forgotten God,‚Äù and ‚Äúonly the imprisoned Brethren were still true Muslims.‚Äù.Kepel, Gilles. Muslim Extremism in Egypt: The Prophet and Pharaoh. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. Print. pg 28,29. While in the camp Qutb wrote a book titled, Signposts, that would serve as a reflection of the time spent in the camp would later serve as a ‚Äútheoretical tool‚Äù that provided the future mission of the Muslim extremists.Kepel, Gilles. Muslim Extremism in Egypt: The Prophet and Pharaoh. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. Print. pg 35. Qutb was released from the prison camp in May 1964, and continued plans to overthrow the regime except for the Brotherhood had divided and could not agree on a political strategy.Kepel, Gilles. Muslim Extremism in Egypt: The Prophet and Pharaoh. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. Print. pg 31. Qutb was arrested a second time in 1965 before being sentenced to hanging in 1966 with several other Muslim Brothers. Although Qutb along with many other Islamists became martyrs for the cause their legacy did not die with them. Qutb‚Äôs writings argued that the Nasser regime belonged to the jahiliyya category. Jahiliyya is an Islamic concept of ‚Äúpre-Islam barbarism‚Äù where the people were ignorant of the guidance of God.Kepel, Gilles. Muslim Extremism in Egypt: The Prophet and Pharaoh. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. Print. pg 37. Qutb claimed that ‚Äúthe restoration of Islam required a genuine revolution‚Äù under the guidance of the Quran.Kepel, Gilles. Muslim Extremism in Egypt: The Prophet and Pharaoh. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. Print. pg 53. =Shukri Mustafa= The next major influencer of Islamic extremism in Egyptian history is Shukri Mustafa (1942‚Äì1978). Egypt was still under Nasser‚Äôs rule when twenty-three-year-old Mustafa joined the Muslim Brotherhood, and was arrested for distributing Muslim Brotherhood materials at Asyut University. Mustafa was sent to Tura prison originally, but was transferred to one of the concentration camps for the Islamic extremists where he encountered different readings of Qutb‚Äôs Signposts, where the youth followers had split into several branches of thought.Kepel, Gilles. Muslim Extremism in Egypt: The Prophet and Pharaoh. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. Print. pg 74. Mustafa joined the Qutbian group of Brothers that sought ‚Äúcomplete physical and spiritual separation from the jahiliyya society.‚ÄùKenney, Jeffery T. Muslim Rebels: Kharijites and the Politics of Extremism in Egypt. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006. Print. pg 127. This ideal was based on Muhammad‚Äôs hijra from Mecca to Medina, ‚Äúwhereby the Prophet removed his band of believers from the dangers and corruption of the unbelievers.‚ÄùKenney, Jeffery T. Muslim Rebels: Kharijites and the Politics of Extremism in Egypt. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006. Print. pg 127. This group of Islamicists that were eventually led by Mustafa were known as al-Takfir wa‚Äôl-Hijra, and based on the ideal of complete separation from the jahiliyya society; they became a modern version of the Kharijites. After Nasser‚Äôs death from health issues, Anwar Sadat took rule over Egypt, and released the prisoner‚Äôs from the concentration camps in 1971, as to try to make peace with the Islamic extremists. Then in 1973, after a conflict with the authorities, Mustafa and some of his followers took refuge in the landscape of the Minya region, ‚Äúenacting the pure model that Mustafa had idealized in prison.‚ÄùKenney, Jeffery T. Muslim Rebels: Kharijites and the Politics of Extremism in Egypt. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006. Print. pg 127. However, in 1977, the group kidnapped[Sheikh Muhammad Hussein al- Dhahabi as a hostage in an attempt to free their brothers, but al-Dhahabi was killed resulting in Mustafa‚Äôs arrest and execution.Kepel, Gilles. Muslim Extremism in Egypt: The Prophet and Pharaoh. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. Print. pg 78. The Takfir group The Takfir group were among the many Islamic extremists that followed in the Kharijite ways, but ‚Äúthe sincerity as Muslims has overshadowed their rationality.‚ÄùKenney, Jeffery T. Muslim Rebels: Kharijites and the Politics of Extremism in Egypt. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006. Print. pg 131. These groups were so concerned with the faults of the Muslim society in Egypt that they took extreme measures in attempt to change the way the modern society functioned. This tension of identifying as both modern and Muslim, has been a source of conflict since the days of colonialism. Kenney states, \\"The problem is that Muslims have lost their ‚Äúcultural identity,‚Äù immersing themselves in the ways of the West; and as a result, they have become weak and divided. The young have lived through this cultural decay, and they have also witnessed the harsh manner in which Muslim activists have been treated in the recent past. Thus their natural instinct is to chance the situation and to seek revenge.\\"Kenney, Jeffery T. Muslim Rebels: Kharijites and the Politics of Extremism in Egypt. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006. Print. pg 131. The Takfir group did not begin as a violent sect, but because of the violence shown to them, they reacted with the same harshness, which creates this never- ending conflict of religious extremism versus the secular state. Sadat‚Äôs government took a democratic position and was willing to negotiate with the Islamic extremist groups, but the religious extremists continued to act out against the government.Kenney, Jeffery T. Muslim Rebels: Kharijites and the Politics of Extremism in Egypt. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006. Print. pg 134. After the government suppressed the Takfir, the group dissolved, and the members would then join other Islamist groups, some of which would cause major uprisings in the future. =Salih Sirriya= Salih Sirriya was born in Ijzim, near Haifa, in 1933 where he would later join the Islamic Liberation Party and be introduced to the Islamist theories.Kepel, Gilles. Muslim Extremism in Egypt: The Prophet and Pharaoh. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. Print. pg 93. Several years later after traveling the Middle East, he settled in Cairo where the Muslim Brotherhood sparked his interest.Kepel, Gilles. Muslim Extremism in Egypt: The Prophet and Pharaoh. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. Print. pg93. ‚ÄúUnlike Shukri, Sirriya created no counter-society and organized no hijra to Cairo‚Äôs furnished flats.‚Äù.Kepel, Gilles. Muslim Extremism in Egypt: The Prophet and Pharaoh. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. Print. pg 93. Even though they disagreed with the jahiliyya society under Sadat, Sirriya and his followers remained in Cairo living normal lives planning a coup d‚Äôe‚Äôtat.Kepel, Gilles. Muslim Extremism in Egypt: The Prophet and Pharaoh. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. Print. pg 93. On April 18, 1974 Sirriya had organized a student ambush at the Military Academy in Heliopolis to hijack the armory and assassinate Sadat.Kepel, Gilles. Muslim Extremism in Egypt: The Prophet and Pharaoh. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. Print. pg 94. The plan failed and Sirriya was arrested, tried, and sentenced to death along with another organizer.Kepel, Gilles. Muslim Extremism in Egypt: The Prophet and Pharaoh. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. Print. pg 94. Jama'at Islamiyya Another similar group that involved students was Jama‚Äôat Islamiyya, an Islamist student association that became a powerful force on university campuses during the relatively calm time before the war of 1973.Kepel, Gilles. Muslim Extremism in Egypt: The Prophet and Pharaoh. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. Print. pg 129. The group held the majority of the positions in the Student Union, and was soon seen as a threat to the regime for their influence amongst other youth.Kepel, Gilles. Muslim Extremism in Egypt: The Prophet and Pharaoh. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. Print. pg 129. ‚ÄúIn the absence of an alternative vanguard ideology, these groups attracted a growing following,‚Äù and campuses became filled with religious literature and activity.Sivan, Emmanuel, and Menachem Friedman. Religious Radicalism and Politics in the Middle East. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1990. Print. pg 143. =Islamic extremism in the media= Al-Da'wa After Sadat‚Äôs release of the Islamicist prisoners, old members of the Brotherhood asked for state recognition of their group, and although Sadat never agreed to their requests he did grant them the privilege to publish a monthly magazine, Al-Da'wa.Kepel, Gilles. Muslim Extremism in Egypt: The Prophet and Pharaoh. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. Print. pg 103. The magazine was first published in 1976 and ran until September 1981.Kepel, Gilles. Muslim Extremism in Egypt: The Prophet and Pharaoh. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. Print. pg 103. Al-Da'wa became a vehicle for the Islamicist movement to reach the general public, and it allowed them to express their intentions and goals on a variety of subjects including social, political, economic, and religious issues.Kepel, Gilles. Muslim Extremism in Egypt: The Prophet and Pharaoh. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. Print. pg 103. Finally, Al-Da'wa was not the sole piece of Islamicist press, but the magazine was popular enough amongst this community that it could serve as a sounding board to judge reactions of the current activities.Kepel, Gilles. Muslim Extremism in Egypt: The Prophet and Pharaoh. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. Print. pg 103, 104. Al-Da'wa is just another example where the ‚Äúdesire to distinguish the just struggle against interfactional strift, ‚Äùbut it also gave ‚Äúunreserved support‚Äù to the members of the Brotherhood.Sivan, Emmanuel, and Menachem Friedman. Religious Radicalism and Politics in the Middle East. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1990. Print. pg 110. Sheik Kishk Islamicist thought also made an appearance through a different form of media, the radio. A man named Abd al-Hamid Kishk, better known as Sheik Kishk, was responsible for recorded sermons that began appearing around 1972.Kepel, Gilles. Muslim Extremism in Egypt: The Prophet and Pharaoh. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. Print. pg 175. Kishk was a religion student and became a leader of prayer, or imam, in government mosques in 1961, but he was arrested by the government in 1966 based on his suspected involvement with the Muslim Brotherhood.Kepel, Gilles. Muslim Extremism in Egypt: The Prophet and Pharaoh. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. Print. pg 175. He was released two years later after and continued to preach at the Ministry of Awqaf, a government ministry in charge of religious endowments.Kepel, Gilles. Muslim Extremism in Egypt: The Prophet and Pharaoh. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. Print. pg 175. Kishk‚Äôs sermons became so popular that extra buildings had to be constructed for his Friday sermons, and they began recording his sermons to be publicly aired on the radio in 1972.Kepel, Gilles. Muslim Extremism in Egypt: The Prophet and Pharaoh. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. Print. pg 175. After about a decade of popularity amongst the Egyptian people, he was arrested again in 1981, and many of his tapes were banned.Kepel, Gilles. Muslim Extremism in Egypt: The Prophet and Pharaoh. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. Print. pg 176. Kishk was released in 1982, after the assassination of Sadat, and the new regime has given him access to the media yet again.Kepel, Gilles. Muslim Extremism in Egypt: The Prophet and Pharaoh. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. Print. pg 176. =Al-Jihad= On 6 October 1981, President Anwar Sadat was assassinated during a military parade by Khalid al-Islambuli, a member of a well-known organization that would bring the ‚Äúimage of the Kharijites to a new level of public attention,‚Äù the Jihad organization.Kenney, Jeffery T. Muslim Rebels: Kharijites and the Politics of Extremism in Egypt. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006. Print. pg 134. The group tried to stage a revolution after the assassination, but was defeated quickly by the government. The Jihad organization, al-Jihad is named after the Islamic term, jihad, which is the ‚Äúholy combat.‚ÄùKepel, Gilles. Muslim Extremism in Egypt: The Prophet and Pharaoh. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. Print. pg 193. As an organization, the Jihad is more of an ‚Äúalliance to like-minded Islamists than a single bureaucratic entity,‚Äù and it has two main branches in Egypt, in Cairo and in Asyut, but the Jihad organization has built a following in countries all throughout the Middle East.Kenney, Jeffery T. Muslim Rebels: Kharijites and the Politics of Extremism in Egypt. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006. Print. pg 135. This is where al-Jihad differs from other groups such as the Takfir group that was led by one leaderZeidan, David. \\"Radical Islam in Egypt: A Comparison of Two Groups.\\" Middle East Review of International Affairs. 3.3 (1999): n. page.

Web. 28 Mar. 2012. . pg 2,3. Mohammed Abdul-Salam Farag One of the main figures in the Jihad, was Mohammed Abdul-Salam Farag. Farag was an electrician, who was an extreme Islamist thinker, and was involved in planning the assassination of Sadat.Kepel, Gilles. Muslim Extremism in Egypt: The Prophet and Pharaoh. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. Print. pg 192. He was arrested and executed for his involvement in the assassination, but left a long-lasting legacy behind him. Farag was a former member of the Muslim Brotherhood and had participated in several other radical groups, but was disillusioned by their passive approach to Islamist thought.Zeidan, David. \\"Radical Islam in Egypt: A Comparison of Two Groups.\\" Middle East Review of International Affairs. 3.3 (1999): n. page. Web. 28 Mar. 2012. . pg 3.

Despite the strong reactions of the government after the assassination of Sadat, al-Jihad reformed into smaller branches and has continued to be the source of terrorist acts and violent community outbreaks ever since.Zeidan, David. \\"Radical Islam in Egypt: A Comparison of Two Groups.\\" Middle East Review of International Affairs. 3.3 (1999): n. page. Web. 28 Mar. 2012. . pg 7. =The end of the century= After the assassination of Sadat, moving into the last decade of the century, al-Jihad remained the most prominent Islamic extremist group in Egypt, and was now harkening back to the ideals of their previous military commander, Lt. Col. Abbud al-Zumar, to recruit and rely on the masses to stage a successful uprising.Sivan, Emmanuel, and Menachem Friedman. Religious Radicalism and Politics in the Middle East.

Religious Radicalism and Politics in the Middle East. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1990. Print. pg 71. Terrorism amongst these groups was not a new occurrence, and throughout the century it came and went in waves of attacks, each more severe than the last.Tal, Nachman. Radical Islam in Egypt and Jordan. Brighton: Sussex Academic Press, 2005. Print. pg 80. The third and last wave of this century began with 1974 ambush of the Military Technological Academy and continued past the end of the century.Tal, Nachman. Radical Islam in Egypt and Jordan.

Radical Islam in Egypt and Jordan. Brighton: Sussex Academic Press, 2005. Print. pg 80. Under Mubarak Hosni Mubarak took over control of the regime after Sadat, and while the first four years of his presidency experienced a relatively low number of violent attacks from radical groups, terrorism continued to increase and the early 1990s became the bloodiest years of the century.Tal, Nachman. Radical Islam in Egypt and Jordan. Brighton: Sussex Academic Press, 2005. Print. pg 81. Much of the movement of the Muslim Brotherhood was non-violent and occurred within the social welfare infrastructures where they found supporters in the people who were socially and economically disadvantaged.Tal, Nachman. Radical Islam in Egypt and Jordan. Brighton: Sussex Academic Press, 2005. Print. pg 85. As the tension rose between the religious and the secular sectors of Egyptian society the movements and acts once again became violent amongst some many of the newer radical groups, and with each attack the regime responded with more severity than the last, which only fueled the radical groups rage against the oppression.Tal, Nachman. Radical Islam in Egypt and Jordan. Brighton: Sussex Academic Press, 2005. Print. pg 85. The new groups that had developed in the 1990s were branches of the prominent groups in the previous two decades, including al-Jihad, and were composed of a much younger, less educated, rural demographic.Tal, Nachman. Radical Islam in Egypt and Jordan. Brighton: Sussex Academic Press, 2005. Print. pg 85. Also the 1990s led to an increase in attacks against political figures, including assassination attempts directed towards the chairman of the parliament, Dr. Rif‚Äô at Mahgoub in 1990, the Egyptian minister of information, Safwat al-Sharif in 1993, and the Egyptian Prime Minister, Atef Sidki also in 1993.Tal, Nachman. Radical Islam in Egypt and Jordan. Brighton: Sussex Academic Press, 2005. Print. pg 95. Despite that many of these attacks were targeted towards figures of power, the Egyptian public feared the wrath of these radical groups. Because ‚Äúextremists exhibit a decided [and collective] tendency toward bigotry, intolerance, compulsive excessiveness in personal piety, the [extreme] judgment of others,‚Äù the decisions and actions of these radical groups ‚Äúdeprives all people of the right to safety and protection, and instead sanctions their killing and the confiscation of their lives and property.‚Äù Kenney, Jeffery T. Muslim Rebels: Kharijites and the Politics of Extremism in Egypt. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006. Print. pg 170. Legacy Despite the large numbers of followers and support for these groups, they still remain a minority in Egyptian society.Zeidan, David. \\"Radical Islam in Egypt: A Comparison of Two Groups.\\" Middle East Review of International Affairs. 3.3 (1999): n. page. Web. 28 Mar. 2012. . pg 7. Their beliefs and actions are contradictory to traditional interpretations of Islam, and for them to take power over the people would require a massive shift in the established belief system.Zeidan, David. \\"Radical Islam in Egypt: A Comparison of Two Groups.\\" Middle East Review of International Affairs. 3.3 (1999): n. page.

Ann Elizabeth Mayer argues that Kharijism does support a democratic model in fact that it is a communal decision to elect a leader, and that this could be the early Islamic model from which to build a modern reform.Kenney, Jeffery T. Muslim Rebels: Kharijites and the Politics of Extremism in Egypt. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006. Print. pg 183.

It is edited by the French broadcasting group MK2 and its title pays tribute to the trilogy \\"Three Colors\\" of Krzysztof Kie≈õlowski. It is distributed only in Paris: in MK2 movie theaters, the Fnac network of Paris, and in 250 cultural places, restaurants, bars, concert halls, and museums. Trois Couleurs reaches 600,000 readers with a total circulation of 200,000. Most of the content is dedicated to cinema and to the promotion of independent films with interviews of directors like Jim Jarmusch or Frederick Wiseman. The editorial policy claims to analyze complicated cultural phenomenon in a simple way in order to suit a readership as wide as can be the audience of a movie theater.  History  At first, Trois Couleurs was only dedicated to the current affairs of MK2 movie theaters. In 2007, editor Elisha Karmitz reshaped the magazine and widened the editorial policy in order to make a proper cultural magazine out of Trois Couleurs. Thus, it was a perfect illustration of a consumer turning into a media.Interview: Elisha Karmitz, directeur de MK2 Agency Moreover, an extension of the distribution systems to 250 cultural places, restaurants, bars, concert halls and museums in Paris accompanied this change. The 50th issue of Trois Couleurs was the first issue published into the reshaped form: there were only 56 pages.MK2 donne une nouvelle jeunesse √† 'Trois Couleurs' The magazine claimed to share an independent look at trends and news in the cultural sector which was conveyed by topics like ¬´ Cult Scene ¬ª, which gave the audience to read a scene which changed the way of making movies. Therefore, the editorial staff offered a very subjective and personal analysis of film and cultural events: for example, it always gave ¬´ 3 reasons to see [a] movie ¬ª. Thus, Trois Couleurs strengthened its relationship with the readership : the readers were in fact very important to the editorial policy, so a page was dedicated to the publication of pieces of art related to cinema drawn by some of the readers. Trois Couleurs developed a practical approach of the events. Besides, the magazine became influent due to the broadcasting of videos of concerts, interviews and documentaries.Daily Motion The editorial staff flew to Detroit to shoot a documentary on Motown RecordsTracks of my tears - 50 ans de Motown and directed the video of a concert of Mos Def at √âlys√©e Montmartre in 2007Mos Def live in Paris which was broadcast on Dailymotion. They repeated the experience with a concert of the Wu-Tang Clan in 2008.WU TANG CLAN live in Paris In 2009, Trois couleurs put on weight \\"Avant/Apr√®s\\" de Trois couleurs ‚Äì nouvelle formule avril 09 and widened its editorial policy: an urban lifestyle guide was added, featuring the best cultural spots in Paris. Then, Trois couleurs claimed to be a prescriber for cultural and urban lifestyle. The magazine got also a new logo which was more aesthetic and charismatic and inspired of urban culture. In December 2009, Trois Couleurs launched his first special issue, which focused on the counterculture of the 1960s and invited Hedi Slimane to be guest editor in chief. '‚ÄôTrois Couleurs was the first free French media to charge for collector issues. Although the monthly magazine talked about news and events, special issues put a cultural corpus into perspective depending on three axis: a thematic approach, a portfolio and several discussions with artists. The first special issue was successful, a fact which fostered the editorial staff to edit a new one when Tom Dicillo‚Äôs documentary on The Doors was released. The special issues were often related to historical events: for example, an issue was dedicated to the Stanley Kubrick exhibition of the Cin√©math√®que Fran√ßaise in 2011. Trois Couleurs\\" also edited a special issue in 2012 when the movie ¬´ On The road ¬ª (based on Jack Kerouac‚Äôs novel) was released and which is particularly relevant of the spirit of the magazine because it was built around the problematic ¬´The man. The book. The film. ¬ª which allowed them to dedicate the contents to the process of creation. In April 2011, the editorial staff shot a 75 minutes documentary about hackism which was directed by one of its editors for the French channel ¬´ France 4 ¬ª. Then, Trois Couleurs met an ex-contributor to WikiLeaks and hacktivists of Anonymous before it became famous. Furthermore, this legitimated Trois Couleurs\\" ‚Äò role of prescriber. The documentary was entitled ¬´ Pirat@ges ¬ª and got several good reviews. During the Festival de Cannes 2011, Trois Couleurs launched a reshaped form of the magazine, which meant 132 pages. √âtienne Rouillon, who was editor in chief on the special issue \\"Games Stories\\" and director of ¬´ Pirat@ges ¬ª became editor in chief of the whole magazine in 2012.  Policy  The aim of Trois Couleurs is to do alternative press in order to suit a readership as wide as can be the audience of a movie theater; moreover, its editorial policy is to always try to analyze complicated cultural phenomenon in a simple way and to open elitist production in the fields of culture, music and cinema to the largest audience they can get. In order to suit its readership, Trois Couleurs favours storytelling in the writing of its articles, like in the special issue called \\"Games Stories\\", released in 2011 to accompany the eponymous exhibition at the Grand Palais. Nevertheless, the magazine keeps a very classical tone and form, so its name is relevant to explain the dialectical construction of its articles. Indeed, a topic is dealt with three levels analysis: *The analysis of the new perspectives in art field opened by the release of a project *The analysis of its feedback *The analysis of it becoming a phenomenon  Circulation  The target of Trois Couleurs Magazine consists in 60% of women, 50% of 15-34 years old people, 40% of middle-class people and 75% of Parisians. The magazine reaches 600,000 readers with a total circulation of 200,000, with MK2‚Äôs movie theaters being responsible for 70% of the total circulation.  Layout  = First part of the magazine = The first pages focus on the news of the month to go, as an echo to the following pages dedicated to cinema. These are set sections, whom the most important are: * Be kind, rewind: this section puts into perspective a lately released movie and one of the same inspiration or dedicated to the same theme * Tendency: while a theme is put on the top of the news because of the broadcasting of a movie, Trois Couleurs analyzes it and backs it with a video corpus * Crosswords: the editorial staff asks someone well-known to comment some paragraphs and quotes from a literary work which is related to the project that person is releasing. * An eye for an eye: this short section analyzes the similarities between a film broadcast in movie theaters and an oldest one * Curriculum vit√¶ : two pages are dedicated to those who operate behind the scenes, by detailing the curriculum vitae of technical experts, concept designers and experts in programming. * Study Case: the editorial staff gives the pros and cons of a movie which is debatable * Investigation File: the editorial staff analyzes a trendy topic during 3 pages * Sex Tape': an article focusing on eroticism in a cultural production = Central Pages = They focus on cinema and highlight neglected cinematographic phenomenon. The contents also gather interviews of actors and directors who are related to a recently broadcast movie. All of the monthly released movies are deciphered according to a personal and subjective look. = Store = These pages present the movies, CDs, books, exhibitions, and video games that the redaction loved. = Guide = This is the last part of the magazine, which develops a practical approach of the Parisian lifestyle thanks to a guide listing the best concerts, bars and exhibitions of the month.

The species is endemic to Australia. Description Plants grow to between 30 and 40 centimetres high. The small, grey green, narrow to ovate leaves are 2.3 to 4 mm long and 0.6 to 0.9 mm wide. The single pea flowers have dark red keels, yellow-orange wings and a yellow-orange standard with red markings on the rear. These are produced between July and October in the species' native range. Taxonomic history The species was formally described by botanist Robert Brown in 1811 in Hortus Kewensis. Brown gave it the name Sclerothamnus microphyllus. The specific epithet is derived from the Greek words micro, meaning small and phyllon meaning leaf, alluding to the plant's small leaves. The species was transferred to the genus Eutaxia in 1894. Another species described by Ferdinand von Mueller in 1858, Eutaxia diffusa, was reclassified as a subspecies of Eutaxia microphylla in 1957, however Mueller's original name was reinstated in 2010. Distribution Eutaxia microphylla is recorded across southern South Australia and north- eastern Tasmania. In Victoria it predominantly occurs in the west of the state and in New South Wales it is recorded in mallee and Mugga Ironbark communities to the west of the Great Dividing Range.

Life 25 Rutland Street, Edinburgh The grave of Robert Cox, Dean Cemetery, Edinburgh He was the son of Robert Cox, leather- dresser, of Gorgie Mills, near Edinburgh, and of Anne Combe, sister of George Combe and Andrew Combe. He was born at Gorgie on 25 Feb. 1810, and received his early education at a private school and at Edinburgh High School. Besides attending the classes of law and of general science at the University of Edinburgh, he also studied anatomy under Robert Knox. For some years Cox was in the legal office of his uncle, George Combe, who wished him to become a partner in the business; but Cox declined. He passed as a writer to the signet, but limited his practice, and occupied himself mainly with scientific and literary matters. At about the age of twenty-five he accepted the secretaryship of a literary institution in Liverpool, the Philosophical Literary and Commercial Institution or Literary, Scientitic, and Commercial Institution, but resigned it in 1839 from considerations of health, and returned to Edinburgh. The attention of Cox was first directed to the Sabbath question by the actions of the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway Company, in withdrawing a limited passenger service in connection with their Sunday trains. Becoming a shareholder, he attended two half-yearly meetings of the company in 1850, at each of which he moved that to the Sunday trains which were being regularly run passenger carriages should be attached. Cox took an active part in the Right of Way Association, and was one of the parties to the action against George Murray, 6th Duke of Atholl, by which Glen Tilt was reopened to the public. A Liberal in politics, he interested himself in social and philanthropic movements of a non-sectarian kind in Edinburgh. He was in practice the manager of the Phrenological Museum, a director and strong supporter of the United Industrial School, a director of the School of Arts, and an active promoter of university endowment and of schemes connected with the higher education of the country. He was a patron of art, and a member of the Edinburgh Association for Promotion of the Fine Arts. Cox lived his final years at 25 Rutland Street, in Edinburgh's fashionable West End.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1871-72 His immediate neighbour (at 23) was the author Dr John Brown. Cox died, unmarried, on 3 February 1872. He is buried with his sister, Marion Cox (1803-1850) in Dean Cemetery in western Edinburgh. The grave lies on the north wall of the original cemetery, close to the grave of his maternal uncle, George Combe. The low-relief bronze head on the grave is sculpted by William Brodie. Works Cox was the active editor of George Combe's Phrenological Journal from Nos. XXXIV to L. of the first series, to which he also contributed articles. After his return to Edinburgh he was induced by Messrs. Black to undertake the compilation of the index to the seventh edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. In 1841 he also resumed the editorship of the Phrenological Journal; it ceased in 1847, on the death of Andrew Combe, of whom he contributed a memoir to the last number. Cox's speeches on the sabbatarian question appeared as a pamphlet, A Plea for Sunday Trains; it was afterwards expanded to 560 pages, published in 1853 as Sabbath Laws and Sabbath Duties; considered in relation to their Natural and Scriptural Grounds, and to the Principles of Religious Liberty. He went on to publish in 1865 the erudite and lucid The Literature of the Sabbath Question, in two volumes. In 1860 he published The Whole Doctrine of Calvin about the Sabbath and the Lord's Day, extracted from his Commentaries, and in 1863 What is Sabbath Breaking? a Discussion occasioned by the Proposal to open the Botanical Gardens of Edinburgh on Sunday Afternoons. He also contributed most of the article \\"Sabbath\\" to Chambers's Encyclop√¶dia. Cox assisted his brothers Dr. Abram Cox of Kingston and Sir James Cox or Coxe, one of her majesty's Commissioners in Lunacy for Scotland, in the revision of Andrew Combe's popular physiological works, and those of George Combe's books dealing with the brain and nervous system. In 1869 he edited, along with James Nicol of Aberdeen, the Select Writings of Charles Maclaren, editor of The Scotsman.

Social structure is obscure in the early part of the period, for which there are few documentary sources. Kinship groups probably provided the primary system of organisation and society was probably divided between a small aristocracy, whose rationale was based around warfare, a wider group of freemen, who had the right to bear arms and were represented in law codes, above a relatively large body of slaves, who may have lived beside and become clients of their owners. From the twelfth century there are sources that allow the stratification in society to be seen in detail, with layers including the king and a small elite of mormaers above lesser ranks of freemen and what was probably a large group of serfs, particularly in central Scotland. In this period the feudalism introduced under David I meant that baronial lordships began to overlay this system, the English terms earl and thane became widespread. Below the noble ranks were husbandmen with small farms and growing numbers of cottars and gresemen (grazing tenants) with more modest landholdings. The combination of agnatic kinship and feudal obligations has been seen as creating the system of clans in the Highlands in this era. Scottish society adopted theories of the three estates to describe its society and English terminology to differentiate ranks. Serfdom disappeared from the records in the fourteenth century and new social groups of labourers, craftsmen and merchants, became important in the developing burghs. This led to increasing social tensions in urban society, but, in contrast to England and France, there was a lack of major unrest in Scottish rural society, where there was relatively little economic change. Early Middle Ages =Kinship= Detail of the Class II Hilton of Cadboll Stone, showing mounted members of the aristocracy The primary unit of social organisation in Germanic and Celtic Europe of the early Middle Ages was the kin group and this was probably the case in early Medieval Scotland.C. Haigh, The Cambridge Historical Encyclopedia of Great Britain and Ireland (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990), , pp. 82‚Äì4. The mention of descent through the female line in the ruling families of the Picts in later sources and the recurrence of leaders clearly from outside of Pictish society, has led to the conclusion that their system of descent was matrilineal. However, this has been challenged by a number of historians who argue that the clear evidence of awareness of descent through the male line suggests that this more likely to indicate an agnatic system of descent, typical of Celtic societies and common throughout North Britain.A. P. Smyth, Warlords and Holy Men: Scotland AD 80‚Äì1000 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1989), , pp. 57‚Äì8.J. T. Koch, Celtic Culture: a Historical Encyclopedia (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2006), , p. 1447. =Social structure= Scattered evidence, including the records in Irish annals and the visual images like the warriors depicted on the Pictish stone slabs at Aberlemno, Forfarshire and Hilton of Cadboll, in Easter Ross, suggest that in Northern Britain, as in Anglo-Saxon England, the upper ranks of society formed a military aristocracy, whose status was largely dependent on their ability and willingness to fight. Below the level of the aristocracy it is assumed that there were non-noble freemen, working their own small farms or holding them as free tenants.J. T. Koch, Celtic Culture: a Historical Encyclopedia (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2006), , p. 369. There are no surviving law codes from Scotland in this period,D. E. Thornton, \\"Communities and kinship\\", in P. Stafford, ed., A Companion to the Early Middle Ages: Britain and Ireland, c.500-c.1100 (Chichester: Wiley-Blackwell, 2009), , pp. 98. but such codes in Ireland and Wales indicate that freemen had the right to bear arms, represent themselves in law and to receive compensation for murdered kinsmen.J. P. Rodriguez, The Historical Encyclopedia of World Slavery, Volume 1 (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 1997), , p. 136. =Slavery= Indications are that society in North Britain contained relatively large numbers of slaves, often taken in war and raids, or bought, as St. Patrick indicated the Picts were doing, from the Britons in Southern Scotland.L. R. Laing, The Archaeology of Celtic Britain and Ireland, c. AD 400‚Äì1200 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006), , pp. 21‚Äì2. Slave owning probably reached relatively far down in society, with most rural households containing some slaves. Because they were taken relatively young, many slaves would have been more integrated into their societies of capture than their societies of origin, in terms of both culture and language. Living and working beside their owners in practice they may have become members of a household without the inconvenience of the partible inheritance rights that divided estates. Where there is better evidence from England and elsewhere, it was common for slaves who survived to middle age to gain their freedom, with such freedmen often remaining clients of the families of their former masters.A. Woolf, From Pictland to Alba: 789 ‚Äì 1070 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , pp. 17‚Äì20. =Religious life= Remains of a chapel on Eileach an Naoimh In the Early Medieval era most evidence of religious practice comes from monks and is heavily biased towards monastic life. From this can be seen the daily cycle of prayers and the celebration of the Mass. There was also the business of farming, fishing and in the islands, seal hunting. Literary life revolved around the contemplation of texts and the copying of manuscripts. Libraries were of great importance to monastic communities. The one at Iona may have been exceptional, but it demonstrates that the monks were part of the mainstream of European Christian culture. Less well recorded, but as significant, was the role of bishops and their clergy. Bishops dealt with the leaders of the tuath, ordained clergy and consecrated churches. They also had responsibilities for the poor, hungry, prisoners, widows and orphans. Priests carried out baptisms, masses and burials. They also prayed for the dead and offered sermons. They anointed the sick with oil, brought communion to the dying and administered penance to sinners. Early local churches were widespread, but since they were largely made of wood,G. Markus, \\"Religious life: early medieval\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 509‚Äì10. like that excavated at Whithorn,J. R. Hume, Scotland's Best Churches (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), , p. 1. the only evidence that survives for most is in place names that contain words for church, including cill, both, eccles and annat, but others are indicated by stone crosses and Christian burials. Beginning on the west coast and islands and spreading south and east, these were replaced with basic masonry-built buildings.I. Maxwell, A History of Scotland's Masonry Construction in P. Wilson, ed., Building with Scottish Stone (Edinburgh: Arcamedia, 2005), , pp. 22‚Äì3. =Education= In the Early Middle Ages, Scotland was overwhelmingly an oral society and education was verbal rather than literary. Fuller sources for Ireland of the same period suggest that there may have been filidh, who acted as poets, musicians and historians, often attached to the court of a lord or king, and passed on their knowledge in Gaelic to the next generation.R. A. Houston, Scottish Literacy and the Scottish Identity: Illiteracy and Society in Scotland and Northern England, 1600‚Äì1800 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), , p. 76. After the \\"de-gallicisation\\" of the Scottish court from the twelfth century, a less highly regarded order of bards took over these functions and they would continue to act in a similar role in the Highlands and Islands into the eighteenth century. They often trained in bardic schools, of which a few, like the one run by the MacMhuirich dynasty, who were bards to the Lord of the Isles,K. M. Brown, Noble Society in Scotland: Wealth, Family and Culture from the Reformation to the Revolutions (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2004), , p. 220. existed in Scotland and a larger number in Ireland, until they were suppressed from the seventeenth century. Much of their work was never written down and what survives was only recorded from the sixteenth century.R. Crawford, Scotland's Books: A History of Scottish Literature (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), . The establishment of Christianity brought Latin to Scotland as a scholarly and written language. Monasteries served as major repositories of knowledge and education, often running schools and providing a small educated elite, who were essential to create and read documents in a largely illiterate society.A. Macquarrie, Medieval Scotland: Kinship and Nation (Thrupp: Sutton, 2004), , p. 128. High Middle Ages Map of mormaer and other Lordships in Medieval Scotland, c. 1230 =Ranks= The legal tract known as Laws of the Brets and Scots, probably compiled in the reign of David I (1124‚Äì53), underlines the importance of the kin group as entitled to compensation for the killing of individual members. It also lists five grades of man: King, mormaer, to√≠sech, √≥cthigern and neyfs.A. Grant, \\"Thanes and Thanages, from the eleventh to the fourteenth centuries\\" in A. Grant and K. Stringer, eds., Medieval Scotland: Crown, Lordship and Community, Essays Presented to G. W. S. Barrow (Edinburgh University Press: Edinburgh, 1993), , p. 42. The highest rank below the king, the mormaer (\\"great officer\\"), was probably composed of about a dozen provincial rulers. Below them the to√≠sech (leader), appear to have managed areas of the royal demesne, or that of a mormaer or abbot, within which they would have held substantial estates, sometimes described as shires.G. W. S. Barrow, Kingship and Unity: Scotland 1000‚Äì1306 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1989), , pp. 15‚Äì18. The lowest free rank mentioned by the Laws of the Brets and Scots, the √≥cthigern (literally, little or young lord), is a term the text does not translate into French. There were probably relatively large numbers of free peasant farmers, called husbandmen in the south and north of the country, but fewer in the lands between the Forth and Sutherland. This changed from the twelfth century, when landlords began to encourage the formation of such a class through paying better wages and deliberate immigration. Below the husbandmen a class of free farmers with smaller parcels of land developed, with cottars and grazing tenants (gresemen). The non-free bondmen, naviti, neyfs or serfs existed in various forms of service, under terms with their origins in Irish practice, including cumelache, cumherba and scoloc who were tied to a lord's estate and unable to leave it without permission, but who records indicate often absconded for better wages or work in other regions, or in the developing burghs. =Feudalism= The feudalism introduced under David I, particularly in the east and south where the crown's authority was greatest, saw the placement of lordships, often based on castles, and the creation of administrative sheriffdoms, which overlay the pattern of administration by local thanes. Land was now held from the king, or a superior lord, in exchange for loyalty and forms of service that were usually military. It also saw the English earl and Latin comes begin to replace the mormaers in the records.A. Grant, \\"Scotland in the Central Middle Ages\\", in A. MacKay and D. Ditchburn, (eds), Atlas of Medieval Europe (Routledge: London, 1997), , p. 97. However, the imposition of feudalism continued to sit beside existing system of landholding and tenure and it is not clear how this change impacted on the lives of the ordinary free and unfree workers. In places, feudalism may have tied workers more closely to the land, but the predominantly pastoral nature of Scottish agriculture may have made the imposition of a manorial system, based on the English model, impracticable.A. D. M. Barrell, Medieval Scotland (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), , pp. 16‚Äì19. Obligations appear to have been limited to occasional labour service, seasonal renders of food, hospitality and money rents.G. W. S. Barrow, \\"Scotland, Wales and Ireland in the twelfth century\\", in D. E. Luscombe and J. Riley-Smith, eds, The New Cambridge Medieval History, Volume IV. 1024-c. 1198, part 2 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), , p. 586. =Royal women= St Margaret of Scotland, the first king's wife to be recorded as \\"queen\\", from a later genealogy A large proportion of the women for who biographical details survive for the Middle Ages, were members of the royal houses of Scotland, either as princesses or queen consorts. Some of these became important figures in the history of Scotland or gained a significant posthumous reputation. There was only one reigning Scottish Queen in this period, the uncrowned and short-lived Margaret, Maid of Norway (r. 1286‚Äì90).R. M. Warnicke, Mary Queen of Scots (London: Taylor & Francis, 2012), , p. 9. The first wife called \\"queen\\" in Scottish sources is the Anglo-Saxon and German princess Margaret, the wife of Malcolm III, which may have been a title and status negotiated by her relatives. She was a major political and religious figure within the kingdom, but her status was not automatically passed on to her successors, most of whom did not have the same prominence.J. Nelson, \\"Scottish Queenship in the Thirteenth century\\", in B. K. U. Weiler, J. Burton and P. R. Schofield, eds, Thirteenth-Century England (London: Boydell Press, 2007), , pp. 63‚Äì4. Ermengarde de Beaumont, the wife of William I acted as a mediator, judge in her husband's absence and is the first Scottish Queen known to have had her own seal.J. Nelson, \\"Scottish Queenship in the Thirteenth century\\", in B. K. U. Weiler, J. Burton and P. R. Schofield, eds, Thirteenth-Century England (London: Boydell Press, 2007), , pp. 66‚Äì7. =Monasticism= Some early Scottish monasteries had dynasties of abbots, who were often secular clergy with families, as at Dunkeld and Brechin.A. Macquarrie, Medieval Scotland: Kinship and Nation (Thrupp: Sutton, 2004), , pp. 117‚Äì128. Perhaps in reaction to this secularisation, a reforming movement of monks called C√©li D√© (lit. \\"vassals of God\\"), anglicised as culdees, began in Ireland and spread to Scotland in the late eighth and early ninth centuries. Some C√©li D√© took vows of chastity and poverty and while some lived individually as hermits, others lived beside or within existing monasteries.B. Webster, Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity (New York City, NY: St. Martin's Press, 1997), , p. 58. The introduction of continental forms of monasticism to Scotland is associated with Queen Margaret (c. 1045‚Äì93). She was in communication with Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, and he provided a few monks for a new Benedictine abbey at Dunfermline (c. 1070). Subsequent foundations under Margaret's sons, Edgar (r. 1097‚Äì1107), Alexander (r. 1107‚Äì24) and particularly David I (r. 1124‚Äì53), tended to be of the reformed type that followed the lead set by Cluny Abbey in the Loire from the late tenth century. Most belonged to the new religious orders that originated in France in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. These stressed the original Benedictine virtues of poverty, chastity and obedience, but also contemplation and service of the Mass and were followed in various forms by reformed Benedictine, Augustinian and Cistercian houses. This period also saw the introduction of more sophisticated forms of church architecture that had become common on the Continent and in England, known collectively as Romanesque.M .Perry, M. Chase, J. R. Jacob, M. C. Jacob, T. H. Von Laue, Western Civilization: Ideas, Politics, and Society (Cengage Learning, 2012), , p. 270.T. W. West, Discovering Scottish Architecture (Botley: Osprey, 1985), , p. 10. =Saints= The Monymusk Reliquary, or Brecbennoch, said to house the bones of Columba One of the main features of Medieval Catholicism was the Cult of Saints. Saints of Irish origin who were particularly revered included various figures called St Faelan and St. Colman, and saints Findbar and Finan.G. W. S. Barrow, Kingship and Unity: Scotland 1000‚Äì1306 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1989), , p. 64. Columba remained a major figure into the fourteenth century and a new foundation was endowed by William I (r. 1165‚Äì1214) at Arbroath Abbey and his relics, contained in the Monymusk Reliquary, were handed over to the Abbot's care.B. Webster, Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity (New York City, NY: St. Martin's Press, 1997), , pp. 52‚Äì3. Regional saints remained important to local identities. In Strathclyde the most important saint was St Kentigern, whose cult (under the pet name St. Mungo) became focused in Glasgow.A. Macquarrie, Medieval Scotland: Kinship and Nation (Thrupp: Sutton, 2004), , p. 46. In Lothian it was St Cuthbert, whose relics were carried across the Northumbria after Lindisfarne was sacked by the Vikings before being installed in Durham Cathedral.A. Lawrence-Mathers, Manuscripts in Northumbria in the Eleventh and Twelfth Centuries (Woodbridge: Brewer, 2003), , p. 137. After his martyrdom around 1115, a cult emerged in Orkney, Shetland and northern Scotland around Magnus Erlendsson, Earl of Orkney.H. Antonsson, St. Magn√∫s of Orkney: A Scandinavian Martyr-Cult in Context (Leiden: Brill, 2007), . One of the most important cults in Scotland, that of St Andrew, was established on the east coast at Kilrymont by the Pictish kings as early as the eighth century.G. W. S. Barrow, Robert Bruce and the Community of the Realm of Scotland (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 4th edn., 2005), , p. 11. The shrine, which from the twelfth century was said to have contained the relics of the saint brought to Scotland by Saint Regulus,B. Webster, Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity (New York City, NY: St. Martin's Press, 1997), , p. 55. began to attract pilgrims from across Scotland, but also from England and further away. By the twelfth century the site at Kilrymont had become known simply as St. Andrews and it became increasingly associated with Scottish national identity and the royal family. Its bishop would supplant that of Dunkeld as the most important in the kingdom and would begin to be referred to as Bishop of Alba. The site was renewed as a focus for devotion with the patronage of Queen Margaret,M. Lynch, Scotland: A New History (Random House, 2011), , p. 76. who also became important after her canonisation in 1250 and after the ceremonial transfer of her remains to Dunfermline Abbey, as one of the most revered national saints. =Schools= In the High Middle Ages there were new sources of education, such as song and grammar schools. These were usually attached to cathedrals or a collegiate church and were most common in the developing burghs. By the end of the Middle Ages grammar schools could be found in all the main burghs and some small towns. Early examples including the High School of Glasgow in 1124 and the High School of Dundee in 1239. There were also petty schools, more common in rural areas and providing an elementary education.M. Lynch, Scotland: A New History (Random House, 2011), , pp. 104‚Äì7. Late Middle Ages =Kinship and clans= Map showing Highland clans and lowland surnames The agnatic kinship and descent of late Medieval Scottish society, with members of a group sharing a (sometimes fictional) common ancestor, was often reflected in a common surname in the south. Unlike in England, where kinship was predominantly cognatic (derived through both males and females), women retained their original surname at marriage and marriages were intended to create friendship between kin groups, rather than a new bond of kinship.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 29‚Äì35. As a result, a shared surname has been seen as a \\"test of kinship\\", providing large bodies of kin who could call on each other‚Äôs support. This could help intensify the idea of the feud, which was usually carried out as a form of revenge for the death or injury of a kinsman. Large bodies of kin could be counted on to support rival sides, although conflict between members of kin groups also occurred.J. W. Armstrong, \\"The 'fyre of ire Kyndild' in the fifteenth-century Scottish Marches\\", in S. A. Throop and P. R. Hyams, eds, Vengeance in the Middle Ages: Emotion, Religion and Feud (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2010), , p. 71. The combination of agnatic kinship and a feudal system of obligation has been seen as creating the Highland clan system, evident in records from the thirteenth century.G. W. S. Barrow, Robert Bruce (Berkeley CA.: University of California Press, 1965), p. 7. Surnames were rare in the Highlands until the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In the Middle Ages all members of a clan did not share a name and most ordinary members were usually not related to its head.J. P. Campbell, Popular Culture in the Middle Ages (Madison, WI: Popular Press, 1986), , p. 98, n. At the beginning of the era, the head of a clan was often the strongest male in the main sept or branch of the clan, but later, as primogeniture began to dominate, it was usually the eldest son of the last chief.J. L. Roberts, Clan, King, and Covenant: History of the Highland Clans from the Civil War to the Glencoe Massacre (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2000), , p. 13. The leading families of a clan formed the fine, often seen as equivalent in status to Lowland gentlemen, providing council to the chief in peace and leadership in war.M. J. Green, The Celtic World (London: Routledge, 1996), , pp. 667. Below them were the daoine usisle (in Gaelic) or tacksmen (in Scots), who managed the clan lands and collected the rents.D. Moody, Scottish Family History (Baltimore, MD: Genealogical Publishing Com, 1994), , pp. 99‚Äì104. In the Isles and along the adjacent western seaboard, there were also buannachann, who acted as a military elite, defending the clan lands from raids and taking part in attacks on clan enemies. Most of the followers of the clan were tenants, who supplied labour to the clan heads and sometimes act as soldiers. In the early modern era they would take the clan name as their surname, turning the clan into a massive, if often fictive, kin group. =Structure= From 1357 onwards parliaments began to be referred to as the Three Estates,D. E. R. Wyatt, \\"The provincial council of the Scottish church\\", in A. Grant and K. J. Stringer, Medieval Scotland: Crown, Lordship and Community (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998), , p. 152. adopting the language of social organisation that had developed in France in the eleventh century.W. W. Kibler, ed., Medieval France: An Encyclopedia (London: Routledge, 1995), , p. 324. It was composed of the clergy, nobles and burgesses,P. J. Bawcutt and J. H. Williams, A Companion to Medieval Scottish Poetry (Woodbridge: Brewer, 2006), , pp. 22. (those that pray, those that fight and those that work). This marked the adoption of a commonplace view of Medieval society as composed of distinct orders.J. Goodare, The Government of Scotland, 1560‚Äì1625 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), , p. 42. Within these estates there were ranks for which the terminology was increasingly dominated by the Scots language and as a result began to parallel that used in England. This consciousness over status was reflected in military and (from 1430) sumptuary legislation, which set out the types of weapons and armour that should be maintained, and clothes that could be worn, by various ranks. A table of ranks in late Medieval Scottish society Below the king were a small number of dukes (usually descended from very close relatives of the king) and earls, who formed the senior nobility. Below them were the barons, who held baronial manors from the crown. From the 1440s, fulfilling a similar role were the lords of Parliament, the lowest level of the nobility with the rank-given right to attend the Estates. There were perhaps 40 to 60 of these in Scotland throughout the period.A. Grant, \\"Service and tenure in late medieval Scotland 1324‚Äì1475\\" in A. Curry and E. Matthew, eds, Concepts and Patterns of Service in the Later Middle Ages (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2000), , pp. 145‚Äì65. Members of these noble ranks, perhaps particularly those that had performed military or administrative service to the crown, might also be eligible for the status of knighthood.K. Stevenson, Chivalry and Knighthood in Scotland, 1424‚Äì1513 (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2006), , pp. 13‚Äì15. Below these were the lairds, roughly equivalent to the English gentlemen. Most were in some sense in the service of the major nobility, either in terms of landholding or military obligations, roughly half sharing with them their name and a distant and often uncertain form of kinship.J. Goodacre, State and Society in Early Modern Scotland (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), , pp. 57‚Äì60. Below the lords and lairds were a variety of groups, often ill-defined. These included yeomen, later called by Walter Scott \\"bonnet lairds\\", often owning substantial land. Below them were the husbandmen, lesser landholders and free tenants that made up the majority of the working population.A. Grant, \\"Late medieval foundations\\", in A. Grant and K. J. Stringer, eds, Uniting the Kingdom?: the Making of British History (London: Routledge, 1995), , p. 99. Serfdom died out in Scotland in the fourteenth century, although through the system of courts baron landlords still exerted considerable control over their tenants. Society in the burghs was headed by wealthier merchants who often held local office as a burgess, alderman, bailies or as a member of the council. A small number of these successful merchants were dubbed knights for their service by the king by the end of the era, although this seems to have been an exceptional form of civic knighthood that did not put them on a par with landed knights.K. Stevenson, \\"Thai war callit knynchtis and bere the name and the honour of that hye ordre: Scottish knighthood in the fifteenth century\\", in L. Clark, ed., Identity and Insurgency in the Late Middle Ages (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2006), , p. 38. Below them were craftsmen and workers that made up the majority of the urban population.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 48‚Äì9. =Social conflict= Historians have noted considerable political conflict in the burghs between the great merchants and craftsmen throughout the period. Merchants attempted to prevent lower crafts and guilds from infringing on their trade, monopolies and political power. Craftsmen attempted to emphasise their importance and to break into disputed areas of economic activity, setting prices and standards of workmanship. In the fifteenth century a series of statutes cemented the political position of the merchants, with limitations on the ability of residents to influence the composition of burgh councils and many of the functions of regulation taken on by the bailies. In rural society historians have noted a lack of evidence of widespread unrest of the nature of that evidenced the Jacquerie of 1358 in France and the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 in England. This was possibly because in Scotland there was relatively little of the type of change in agriculture, like the enclosure of common land, that could create widespread resentment before the modern era. Instead a major factor was the willingness of tenants to support their betters in any conflict in which they were involved, for which landlords reciprocated with charity and support.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 50‚Äì1. Both Highland and border society acquired reputations for lawless activity, particularly the feud. However, more recent interpretations have pointed to the feud as a means of preventing and speedily resolving disputes by forcing arbitration, compensation and resolution.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 28 and 35-9. =Popular religion= The fifteenth-century Trinity Altarpiece by Flemish artist Hugo van der Goes Traditional Protestant historiography tended to stress the corruption and unpopularity of the late Medieval Scottish church, but more recent research has indicated the ways in which it met the spiritual needs of different social groups.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 76‚Äì87.D. M. Palliser, The Cambridge Urban History of Britain: 600‚Äì1540 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), , pp. 349‚Äì50. Historians have discerned a decline of monastic life in this period, with many religious houses keeping smaller numbers of monks, and those remaining often abandoning communal living for a more individual and secular lifestyle. The rate of new monastic endowments from the nobility also declined in the fifteenth century.Andrew D. M. Barrell, Medieval Scotland (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), , p. 246. In contrast, the burghs saw the flourishing of mendicant orders of friars in the later fifteenth century, who, unlike the older monastic orders, placed an emphasis on preaching and ministering to the population. The order of Observant Friars were organised as a Scottish province from 1467 and the older Franciscans and the Dominicans were recognised as separate provinces in the 1480s. In most Scottish burghs, in contrast to English towns where churches and parishes tended to proliferate, there was usually only one parish church,P. J. Bawcutt and J. H. Williams, A Companion to Medieval Scottish Poetry (Woodbridge: Brewer, 2006), , pp. 26‚Äì9. As the doctrine of Purgatory gained importance in the period, the number of chapelries, priests and masses for the dead within them, designed to speed the passage of souls to Heaven, grew rapidly.Andrew D. M. Barrell, Medieval Scotland (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), , p. 254. The number of altars dedicated to saints, who could intercede in this process, also grew dramatically, with St. Mary's in Dundee having perhaps 48 and St Giles' in Edinburgh over 50. The number of saints celebrated in Scotland also proliferated, with about 90 being added to the missal used in St Nicholas church in Aberdeen. New cults of devotion connected with Jesus and the Virgin Mary began to reach Scotland in the fifteenth century, including the Five Wounds, the Holy Blood and the Holy Name of Jesus. There were also new religious feasts, including celebrations of the Presentation, the Visitation and Mary of the Snows.C. Peters, Women in Early Modern Britain, 1450‚Äì1640 (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2004), , p. 147. Tower of St Salvator's College, St Andrews, one of the three universities founded in the fifteenth century In the early fourteenth century the Papacy managed to minimise the problem of clerical pluralism, by which clerics held two or more livings, which elsewhere resulted in parish churches being without priests, or serviced by poorly trained and paid vicars and clerks. However, the number of poor clerical livings and a general shortage of clergy in Scotland, particularly after the Black Death, meant that in the fifteenth century the problem intensified.Andrew D. M. Barrell, Medieval Scotland (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), , pp. 244‚Äì5. As a result, parish clergy were largely drawn from the lower and less educated ranks of the profession, leading to frequent complaints about their standards of education or ability. Although there is little clear evidence that standards were declining, this would be one of the major grievances of the Reformation. Heresy, in the form of Lollardry, began to reach Scotland from England and Bohemia in the early fifteenth century. Lollards were followers of John Wycliffe (c. 1330‚Äì84) and later Jan Hus (c. 1369‚Äì1415), who called for reform of the Church and rejected its doctrine on the Eucharist. Despite evidence of a number of burnings of heretics and limited popular support for its anti-sacramental elements, it probably remained a small movement.Andrew D. M. Barrell, Medieval Scotland (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), , p. 257. There were also further attempts to differentiate Scottish liturgical practice from that in England, with a printing press established under royal patent in 1507 to replace the English Sarum Use for services. =Expansion of schools and universities= The number and size of schools seems to have expanded rapidly from the 1380s. There was also the development of private tuition in the families of lords and wealthy burghers. The growing emphasis on education cumulated with the passing of the Education Act 1496, which decreed that all sons of barons and freeholders of substance should attend grammar schools to learn \\"perfyct Latyne\\". All this resulted in an increase in literacy, but which was largely concentrated among a male and wealthy elite,P. J. Bawcutt and J. H. Williams, A Companion to Medieval Scottish Poetry (Woodbridge: Brewer, 2006), , pp. 29‚Äì30. with perhaps 60 per cent of the nobility being literate by the end of the period.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 68‚Äì72. Until the fifteenth century, those who wished to attend university had to travel to England or the continent, and just over a 1,000 have been identified as doing so between the twelfth century and 1410. After the outbreak of the Wars of Independence, with occasional exceptions under safe conduct, English universities were closed to Scots and continental universities became more significant.B. Webster, Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity (St. Martin's Press, 1997), , pp. 124‚Äì5. Some Scottish scholars became teachers in continental universities. This situation was transformed by the founding of the University of St Andrews in 1413, the University of Glasgow in 1450 and the University of Aberdeen in 1495. Initially these institutions were designed for the training of clerics, but they would increasingly be used by laymen who would begin to challenge the clerical monopoly of administrative posts in the government and law. Those wanting to study for second degrees still needed to go elsewhere and Scottish scholars continued to visit the continent and English universities, which reopened to Scots in the late fifteenth century. =Women= Margaret Tudor, praying before a vision of the Virgin and infant Christ, from Hours of James IV of Scotland, c. 1503 Medieval Scotland was a patriarchal society, where authority was invested in men and women had a very limited legal status. How exactly patriarchy worked in practice is difficult to discern.E. Ewen, \\"The early modern family\\" in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, eds, The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , p. 274. Women could marry from the age of 12 (while for boys it was from 14) and, while many girls from the social elite married in their teens, by the end of the period most in the Lowlands only married after a period of life-cycle service, in their twenties.E. Ewen, \\"The early modern family\\" in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, eds, The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , p. 271. The extensive marriage bars for kinship meant that most noble marriages necessitated a papal dispensation, which could later be used as grounds for annulment if the marriage proved politically or personally inconvenient, although there was no divorce as such.J. E. A. Dawson, Scotland Re-Formed, 1488‚Äì1587 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , pp. 62‚Äì3. Separation from bed and board was allowed in exceptional circumstances, usually adultery.E. Ewen, \\"The early modern family\\" in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, eds, The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , p. 273. In the burghs there were probably high proportions of poor households headed by widows, who survived on casual earnings and the profits from selling foodstuffs or ale.E. Ewen, \\"An Urban Community: The Crafts in Thirteenth Century Aberdeen\\" in A. Grant and K. J. Stringer, Medieval Scotland: Crown, Lordship and Community: Essays Presented to G.W.S Barrow (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998), p. 164. Spinning was an expected part of the daily work of Medieval townswomen of all social classes.E. Ewen, \\"An Urban Community: The Crafts in Thirteenth Century Aberdeen\\" in A. Grant and K. J. Stringer, Medieval Scotland: Crown, Lordship and Community: Essays Presented to G. W. S. Barrow (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998), p. 171. In crafts, women could sometimes be apprentices, but they could not join guilds in their own right. Some women worked and traded independently, hiring and training employees, which may have made them attractive as marriage partners.M. A. Hall, \\"Women only? Women in Medieval Perth\\", in S. Boardman and E. Williamson, The Cult of Saints and the Virgin Mary in Medieval Scotland (London: Boydell & Brewer, 2010), , p. 110. Scotland was relatively poorly supplied with nunneries, with 30 identified for the period to 1300, compared with 150 for England, and very few in the Highlands.J. E. Burton, Monastic and religious orders in Britain: 1000‚Äì1300 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994), , p. 86.G. W. S. Barrow, Kingship and Unity: Scotland 1000‚Äì1306 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1981), , p. 80. The Virgin Mary, as the epitome of a wife and mother was probably an important model for women.M. A. Hall, \\"Women only? Women in Medieval Perth\\", in S. Boardman and E. Williamson, The Cult of Saints and the Virgin Mary in Medieval Scotland (London: Boydell & Brewer, 2010), , p. 109. There is evidence from late Medieval burghs like Perth, of women, usually wives, acting through relatives and husbands as benefactors or property owners connected with local altars and cults of devotion. By the end of the fifteenth century, Edinburgh had schools for girls, sometimes described as \\"sewing schools\\", which were probably taught by lay women or nuns.M. Lynch, Scotland: A New History (Random House, 2011), , pp. 104‚Äì7. There was also the development of private tuition in the families of lords and wealthy burghers, which may have extended to women. =Children= Childhood mortality was high in Medieval Scotland.E. Ewen, \\"'Hamperit in ane holy came': sights, smells and sounds in the Medieval town\\", in E. J. Cowan and L. Henderson, eds, A History of Everyday Life in Medieval Scotland: 1000 to 1600 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2011), , p. 126. Children were often baptised rapidly, by laymen and occasionally by midwives, because of the belief that unbaptised children would be damned.E. J. Cowan and L. Henderson, \\"Introduction: everyday life in Scotland\\", in E. J. Cowan and L. Henderson, eds, A History of Everyday Life in Medieval Scotland: 1000 to 1600 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2011), , p. 6. It was more normally undertaken in a church and was a means of creating wider spiritual kinship with godparents.E. Ewen, \\"The early modern family\\" in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, eds, The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , p. 278. Cemeteries may not represent a cross section of Medieval society, but in one Aberdeen cemetery 53 per cent of those buried were under the age of six and in one Linlithgow cemetery it was 58 per cent. Iron deficiency anaemia seems to have been common among children, probably caused by long-term breastfeeding by mothers that were themselves deficient in minerals. Common childhood diseases included measles, diphtheria and whooping-cough, while parasites were also common. In Lowland noble and wealthy society by the fifteenth century the practice of wet-nursing had become common. In Highland society there was a system of fosterage among clan leaders, where boys and girls would leave their parent's house to be brought up in that of other chiefs, creating a fictive bond of kinship that helped cement alliances and mutual bonds of obligation.A. Cathcart, Kinship and Clientage: Highland Clanship, 1451‚Äì1609 (Brill, 2006), , pp. 81‚Äì2. The majority of children, even in urban centres where opportunities for formal education were greatest, did not attend school. In the families of craftsmen children probably carried out simpler tasks. They might later become apprentices or journeymen.E. Ewen, \\"An urban community: the crafts in thirteenth-century Aberdeen\\", in A. Grant and K. K. J. Stringer, eds, Medieval Scotland: Crown, Lordship and Community (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998), , p. 157. In Lowland rural society, as in England, many young people, both male and female, probably left home to become domestic and agricultural servants, as they can be seen doing in large numbers from the sixteenth century.I. D. Whyte, \\"Population mobility in early modern Scotland\\", in R. A. Houston and I. D. Whyte, Scottish Society, 1500‚Äì1800 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), , p. 52. By the late Medieval era, Lowland society was probably part of the north-west European marriage model, of life- cycle service and late marriage, usually in the mid-20s, delayed by the need to acquire the resources to be able to form a household.E. Ewen, \\"The early modern family\\" in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, eds, The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , p. 277. Notes ","title":"Scottish society in the Middle Ages"},{"id":"35431275","text":"The culture of Northern Cyprus is the pattern of human activity and symbolism associated with Northern Cyprus and Turkish Cypriots. It features significant elements influenced by or developed upon the culture of Turkey, but combines these elements with a unique Cypriot approach and local traditions (in common with Greek Cypriots), as well as several other influences, such as the British and contemporary western cultures.  Music  Ziynet Sali is a Turkish Cypriot pop singer famous in Turkey and Northern Cyprus. = Contemporary music = Turkish Cypriot cities and towns regularly organize festivals that include performances of local and international singers and bands. Some Turkish Cypriot singers, such as Ziynet Sali and I≈üƒ±n Karaca, have achieved fame in Turkey. The Turkish Cypriot band Sƒ±la 4 produced music that is considered essential for the Turkish Cypriot identity, and also acquired fame in Turkey. Rock and pop music are popular with the public in Northern Cyprus, important singers and bands include SOS and Fikri Karayel. = Folk music = Kamran Aziz, pictured here in 1954, was a leading Turkish Cypriot composer Turkish Cypriot folk music consists of a rich variety of local tunes, influenced by the mainland Turkish music to a limited extent. Historically, it was shaped around the tradition of weddings, the primary social gatherings at the time. Violin, goblet drum, known locally as \\"darbuka\\", zurna and other drums were heavily used in these gatherings, and a large number of traditional songs developed based on this legacy. Many traditional songs are shared with the Greek Cypriot community. The songs were not only used for entertainment at weddings, but also at other special occasions such as bayrams, circumcision ceremonies and wrestling matches, when a band, called \\"ince saz\\" (\\"shrill ensemble\\") consisting of a darbuka player, violinist, tambourine and cymbals players would be assembled. The name was given with reference to the shrill and loud sounds of the instruments that could be heard from miles away, signalling entertainment. In the distant past, when the society was gender- segregated, blind violinists would be hired to come and play at women's quarters as men were not allowed to see them, these violinists frequented the Kumarcilar Han in Nicosia. Turkish Cypriot folk music can be categorized into two groups: the t√ºrk√ºs and \\"oyun havalarƒ±\\", music that was meant to accompany folk dances and entertainment during weddings. Among the t√ºrk√ºs, some important ones are \\"Dillirga\\", \\"Kebap√ßƒ±larƒ±n ≈üi≈üi\\" (\\"the skewers of the kebab makers\\") and \\"Portakal atƒ±≈üalƒ±m\\" (\\"let's throw each other oranges\\"). Whilst Kamran Aziz mostly composed non-folkloric pieces, many of her compositions are now considered to be part of the Turkish Cypriot folk music canon. She is also considered to have started Turkish Cypriot pop music in its modern sense. = Classical music = Musicians from the Lefko≈üa Municipal Orchestra performing in B√ºy√ºk Han In Northern Cyprus, both western and Ottoman styles of classical music are performed. R√ºya Taner, Turkish Cypriot classical pianist The Northern Cyprus State Symphony Orchestra was established in 1975, but the efforts to develop and promote it never met with success. In 2014, the Presidential Symphony Orchestra was established. It was initially intended to consist of 39 musicians, but delivered its first concert in the Bellapais Abbey in Kyrenia with 61 participating musicians, all of whom were Turkish Cypriots. The Bellapais Abbey hosts international festivals of classical music, including the Bellapais International Festival of Classical Music, and is considered in important platform of classical music. The International Northern Cyprus Music Festival is also an important musical event, held in September and October in the Bellapais Abbey, ancient city of Salamis and the Kyrenia Castle, holding concerts and shows of classical music, tango, symphonic rock, chamber orchestras, flamenco and Romani music. North Nicosia has its own Lefko≈üa Municipal Orchestra that performs at open spaces, such as parks and squares, and is also home to the annual Walled City Jazz Festival. R√ºya Taner is a Turkish Cypriot pianist who has achieved international acclaim. The first Ottoman classical music establishment in Cyprus was founded in 1924 and was called Dar√ºl-Elhan. It was involved in education and performances, and dissolved in 1953 to be replaced by several groups. In 1985, the State Turkish Music Choir was established to officially institutionalize the activities. The choir is still active and frequently delivers concerts throughout Northern Cyprus.  Dance  = Folk dances = Turkish Cypriot children, dressed in traditional clothing, preparing for a folk-dance show Turkish Cypriot culture also incorporates a great diversity of folk dances with various influences, including different versions of karsilamas, √ßiftetelli and zeybek. There is no definite number of Turkish Cypriot folk dances and dances have different names and styles in different regions. Dances could be exclusively for men, women or for mixed groups These folk dances were a crucial part of the weddings in the past, along with folk music. and carry motifs of traditional entertainment, lifestyles and important occasions. A folk dance tradition that still exists among Turkish Cypriots is the \\"testi oyunu\\", where an earthen pot is filled with coins, almonds, raisins and candies before weddings by the mother and in-laws of the bride-to-be and young women dance around the pot and finally break it during the dance. The scattered candies are then picked up by children. Since the 1980s, there has been a revival of the traditional folk dances in Northern Cyprus due to the intensive activities of the folk dance groups established by the Ministry of Education, municipalities and various associations. This has led to the revival of previously forgotten traditions such as the henna night dances and also paved the way for the mixed practice by men and women of dances traditionally associated with one sex only, such as \\"testi oyunu\\". Turkish Cypriot folk dance groups practice their traditions in festivals in several European countries. Since the 1980s, the country has also organized international folk dance festivals and competitions, in Trikomo/ƒ∞skele and G√∂nyeli. The first folk dance and folklore association in Northern Cyprus, HASDER, was founded in 1977. = Other styles of dance = The Bellapais Abbey is home to many classical music and dance events. The universities of Northern Cyprus are sources of diversity in terms of dance, as they hold nights where the students from tens of countries and continent perform their traditional dances. Northern Cyprus hosts annual dance festivals in several styles. Salsa Jam is an annual festival of salsa, held in Kyrenia and the International Cyprus Tango Festival takes place in the Bellapais Abbey every year, organized by the Cyprus Tango Culture and Arts Association. Shows of other styles of dance, such as traditional Chinese dance, occasionally take place. Several modern dance activities also take place in North Nicosia, where a number of dance schools are established. Internationally renowned musicals and dance shows are performed in front of crowded audiences in the Atat√ºrk Culture and Congress Center. In 2010, North Nicosia was part of the international Earthdance activity, which was witnessed by thousands of locals. Literature = Poetry = Kaytazzade Mehmet Nazƒ±m, an early Turkish Cypriot poet The historical R√ºstem Bookshop in North Nicosia. Poetry is the most widely published form of literature in Northern Cyprus. Turkish Cypriot poetry is based on both the effects of Turkish literature and the culture of the island of Cyprus, along with some reflection of the British colonial history. Early Turkish Cypriot poets include Kaytazzade Mehmet Nazƒ±m, A≈üƒ±k Kenzi and Hasan Hilmi Efendi, who was called \\"the sultan of poets\\" by the Ottoman sultan Mahmud II.Gazioƒülu, Ahmet C. (1990). The Turks in Cyprus: a province of the Ottoman Empire (1571‚Äì1878), 293‚Äì295, K. R√ºstem. However, these poets are often not included in a distinct Turkish Cypriot literature as their writing identified with the Ottoman Empire and the Islamic community rather than Turkish Cypriots, whose literary identity had not been established at this time. The first era of Turkish Cypriot poetry after the introduction of the Latin alphabet, characterised by poets such as Nazif S√ºleyman Ebeoƒülu, Urkiye Mine Balman, Engin G√∂n√ºl, Necla Salih Suphi and Pembe Marmara, had strong nationalistic elements due to the political attitudes of Turkish Cypriots at the time and stylistically reflected the poetry of the Turkish mainland. Meanwhile, other poets, such as √ñzker Ya≈üƒ±n, Osman T√ºrkay, who was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature twice,Kozmik ≈üiirin yazarƒ± (H√ºrriyet), retrieved on 31 December 2014. and Nevzat Yal√ßƒ±n sought to write in more original styles, with the influence of nascent poetic styles in Turkey and those in Britain. This group of poets were very prolific and increased the popularity of poetry in the Turkish Cypriot community, and are seen as key figures in Turkish Cypriot literature.Turan, Metin. √áaƒüda≈ü Kƒ±brƒ±s T√ºrk ≈ûiirinde Eƒüilimler/ Y√∂nelimler (√áukurova University) Retrieved on 27 May 2012. In the 1960s, some poets attempted to popularize the then-mainstream poetic movements in Turkey. However, these attempts failed as the Turkish Cypriot society had a different political and cultural background. During this period, poets such as Fikret Demiraƒü, who followed a writing style in line with Turkey, developed a movement of abstract poetry in Cyprus. The nationalism gave way to a notion of Cypriotness in the 1970s, with the influence of Ya≈üƒ±n, T√ºrkay and Yal√ßƒ±n. During this period, the so-called \\"1974 generation of poets\\" arose, led by poets including Mehmet Ya≈üƒ±n, Hakkƒ± Y√ºcel, Nice Denizoƒülu, Ne≈üe Ya≈üƒ±n, Ay≈üen Daƒülƒ± and Canan S√ºmer. The poetry of this generation was characterized by the appreciation of the Turkish Cypriot identity as distinct from Turkish identity and the identification of Cyprus as the Turkish Cypriot homeland instead of Turkey, in contrast to the previous nationalist poetry. This approach is often called the \\"Cypriot poetry of rejection\\" as it resists the influence of Turkey, highlighting the cultural rift between Turkey and Cyprus due to the recent experience of war and therefore the independence of the Turkish Cypriot poetry and identity. This was followed by an increased adoption of the Mediterranean identity in the 1980s, accompanied by the effects of the liberalization of the Turkish Cypriot society, as reflected in the feminist elements, of which a particular example is Neriman Cahit.‚ÄúBo≈üluƒüun hasadƒ± kalemledir‚Äù (Radikal) retrieved on 31 December 2014.Ya≈üƒ±n, Mehmet.

Balman has published her works in Yesilada, T√ºrk Dili, and T√ºrk'e Dogru literary magazines in Turkey. = Oral literature = M√¢ni is an important form of traditional oral literature in the Turkish Cypriot culture. Before the transformation of the Turkish Cypriot society in the 20th century, winter nights were traditionally spent with the family, with the members of the family exchanging manis, riddles and folk tales for entertainment. While Turkish Cypriot manis originate from the Turkish oral tradition, they show significant functional differences, such as the elimination of religion-based manis about Ramadan in Cyprus. It was used as an important expression of love, especially during the times when lovers had to meet in secret. Traditionally, the use of manis have differed by the gender, with women using them at weddings, circumcision ceremonies, visits to the neighbors, and other forms of entertainment, as well as during harvest, while men performed them at weddings, festivals and while drinking in taverns. Manis were learned from elderly mani tellers, who sometimes made subtle criticisms to the listener in the mani. This led to a tradition of \\"mani atƒ±≈ümasƒ±\\", when two sides had a conversation, sometimes in a humorous way, using manis. Manis were also used for delivering advice to young people. There were special manis for weddings, ceremonies of asking for the girl's hand and henna nights. Currently, the use of manis has greatly decreased in the society, but still persists, especially among women in rural areas. They are also used for entertaining the children by the elderly. In Turkish Cypriot folklore, fairy tales are called \\"mesel\\" (as opposed to \\"masal\\" in standard Turkish). These fairy tales were usually told to children by elderly women, who were either relatives or guests of the parents. They were also told in coffeehouses by traditional storytellers. Turkish Cypriots fairy tales exhibit significant similarities with those in Anatolia and some are very similar to those in Turkmenistan. They often feature surrealistic events, such as those in foreign palaces and countries with exotic plants, or those featuring jinns engaged in the traditional Turkic sport cirit. However, they usually depict themes encountered in daily lives, such as love and ambition and were used to pass on traditional concepts regarding roles in the family, dynamics of relationships and conflicts that arise due to behavior to the children. Often, fairy tales are very typical with their use of language, as they utilize certain phrases and patterns to denote the beginning and the end of the story, as well as certain actions.  Media  = Television = BRT headquarters in Nicosia. Northern Cyprus has fourteen television channels, often accompanied by radio stations owned by the same company. Of these, BRT, which has two channels and many radio stations, is the state television.Kahvecioƒülu, Hasan. Cyprus - Part Two BRT is also the oldest Turkish Cypriot TV channel; it was established as a radio station in 1963, and launched its first television broadcast in 1976.BRT FROM 1963 TO TODAY (BRT) Retrieved 2011-04-22. Several Turkish Cypriot television channels are aligned with political parties or ideologies and make programs and reports according to their ideology, rather than for economic interests or publicity. Another factor that heavily politicizes Turkish Cypriot television is the political interests of the television channel owners, despite the Turkish Cypriot law prohibiting any person to own more than 20% of the shares of a channel. =Cinema= Anahtar (Key), released in 2011, was the first full- length film entirely produced in Northern Cyprus. Some other co-productions have also taken place. A co-production of Northern Cyprus, Turkey, Britain and the Netherlands, Kod Adƒ± Ven√ºs (Code Name Venus) was shown in the Cannes Film Festival in 2012. The film director and screenwriter Dervi≈ü Zaim achieved fame with his 2003 film Mud (√áamur) which won the UNESCO award at the Venice Film Festival. The documentary film Kayƒ±p Otob√ºs (The Missing Bus), directed by Turkish Cypriot journalist Fevzi Ta»ôpƒ±nar, was aired on the TRT TV as well as participating in the Boston Film Festival in 2011. The film tells the story of eleven Turkish Cypriot workers who left their homes in a bus in 1964 that never came back. Their remains were found in a well in Cyprus in October 2006.  Handicrafts  The Lefkara lace. The Lefkara lace is an important form of embroidery in Northern Cyprus and is celebrated nationwide. Before 1974, it was produced in the mixed village of Pano Lefkara. After the invasion, it was brought to the north by Turkish Cypriot refugees, where it became popular everywhere and started being sold in the historic center of North Nicosia, in B√ºy√ºk Han and Arasta. The lace is believed to be more than 700 years old and a synthesis of Venetian and Cypriot culture, and has 7-8 surviving forms. The Lapta lace, also known as \\"hesap i≈üi\\", is an exclusively Cypriot handicraft and is mostly practiced by Turkish Cypriots around Lapithos. It is rooted in the 19th century and has unique patterns. \\"Koza i≈üi\\", made from the silk cocoons of caterpillars, is another handicraft that is exclusive to Cyprus, where the cocoons are cut and embroidered in trays in unique designs. Braiding together reeds, straws, branches of date trees and other branches to make baskets and ornaments is a common handicraft in Northern Cyprus. A unique product, traditionally braided by Cypriot women, is the sesta, which is a uniquely designed pan with original designs, made from the stem of a particular kind of wheat. A traditionally important and symbolic handicraft in the Turkish Cypriot culture is the manufacture of chairs from reeds and straws. These chairs were traditionally ubiquitous in homes, where they were considered standard furniture. However, this handicraft is currently under the threat of extinction due to the competition from plastic chairs and meticulous work involved. Traditional handicrafts in Cyprus are commonly taught and practiced by women's village courses, organized by the government and municipalities, and exhibited at cultural centers. There are also courses open to everyone, organized by municipalities, and some associations promoting and producing handicrafts. Most forms of embroidery, however, are still considered as women's work. Sports Nicosia Atat√ºrk Stadium is the largest stadium in Northern Cyprus. There are five stadiums in Northern Cyprus, with each holding a capacity ranging anywhere from 7,000 to 30,000. The most popular sport in Northern Cyprus is soccer.

Theater Karag√∂z and Hacivat Theater in Northern Cyprus is mostly carried out by the Turkish Cypriot State Theater, municipal theaters and a number of private theatrical companies. Cyprus Theater Festival, organised by the Nicosia Turkish Municipality is a large organization with institutions from Turkey participating as well.

An early Turkish Cypriot theatre group, 1880s The origins of Turkish Cypriot theater lie in Karag√∂z and Hacivat, a shadow play that was popularized in the island as a form of entertainment during the Ottoman era. This form of theater has lost its popularity nowadays, but remains to be televised during religious festivals.Turkish-Cypriot Theatres, cypnet.co.uk, retrieved on 28 December 2014. After the 1840s, as the Ottoman Empire started modernizing, theater with greater European elements met with the Turkish Cypriot public.

Each leaf also divides only twice (bipinnate): * The central midrib of the frond (rachis) branches into many horizontal leaflets (pinnae). * Each pinna midrib bears many small leaflets (pinnules). Forms and distribution There are two natural Mauritian varieties, which occur mainly in the upland forest in the higher parts of the island, and are both endangered. There is one natural Reunionese variety: * C. borbonica var. borbonica (R√©union). * C. borbonica var. latifolia (Mauritius), which bears an umbrella-shaped crown * C. borbonica var. sevathiana (Mauritius), which bears a funnel-shaped crown Related species In Mauritius, they share the island with several other tree ferns - the naturally occurring Mauritian species Cyathea grangaudiana and Cyathea excelsa - and the alien non-indigenous Cyathea cooperi which is introduced from its native Australia. In R√©union, they share the island with the naturally occurring R√©unionese species Cyathea glauca and Cyathea excelsa - and also with the introduced Cyathea cooperi.A revision of the fern family Cyatheaceae in the Mascarene Islands (2006) Cyathea borbonica can be distinguished from all of these other species by its small stipe and by its fronds' two-level division.M.

It consists of five poems in free format, followed by 45 haiku in eleven suites. It is one of the two collections Transtr√∂mer has written after his 1990 stroke, and it was therefore written at a slow pace with the left hand. It was published in English in 2006. Content Five free-form poems are followed by 45 which follow the form of the haiku, organised into eleven suites. The suites are loosely organised by genre and themes, which include the carpe diem motif, theistic epiphanies, nature depictions, snapshots from travels and reflections on death. The themes frequently blend. Genesis In November 1990, Tomas Transtr√∂mer suffered a stroke which paralysed the right side of his body and damaged his ability to speak. He therefore had to cancel a large-scale poetry project he was working on, about the history of Europe, to instead write more concise poems. Several times he considered to quit writing altogether, but kept coming up with new ideas. He returned to the haiku format, which he according to himself had been both reading and writing for his whole life. His earliest published haiku were written in 1959, when he worked at a youth prison, and in 1996 he published the collection The Sorrow Gondola which contained eleven more. The next eight years he continued to write the same way, with his left hand and at a slow pace. The haiku in The Great Enigma were not written with a strict adherence to classic conventions, but do follow the rule of three lines with five, seven and five syllables. The main inspirations for the poems were travelling, death and dreams. Publication The book was published in Sweden on 19 March 2004 by Albert Bonniers f√∂rlag. The cover is a painting by the artist Peter Frie which was selected by Transtr√∂mer. In April the book was released on CD, read by actor Krister Henriksson, and accompanied by Transtr√∂mer on piano, performing bits by Josef Mattias Hauer, Federico Mompou, Maurice Karkoff, Cor de Groot and Werner Wolf Glaser with his left hand. The collection was translated to English by Robin Fulton, and first appeared in the 2006 volume The Great Enigma: New Collected Poems. Reception Svenska Dagbladet's critic wrote: \\"When reading [the first five poems] you are delighted by the natural easiness which always has characterised Transtr√∂mer's poetry, in the following haikus by the formal restraint and discipline which makes up the other side of his authorship - not a word too much!\\" The critic continued: \\"Transtr√∂mer's new poems are permeated by a completely natural piety. No high tones, no preachment! Only a calm confidence before mortality and a through and through unsentimentally formulated gratitude for being able to exist, to participate.\\" The book was nominated for the August Prize. In 2007, Frie, whose painting is on the book's cover, collaborated with Transtr√∂mer and exhibited 13 original landscape paintings inspired by the book.

CVac was developed by the biotechnology company Prima BioMed (Nasdaq: PBMD) through to Phase II clinical studies between 2001 and 2015. After inconclusive clinical data in ovarian cancer 2013 and 2014, Prima announced in February 2015 that it had ceased recruiting into CVAc clinical studies and was seeking commercial partners for the product.  Treatment method  CVac is an ex vivo dendritic cell priming technology involving MFP, or mannan fusion protein, where a fusion protein of MUC1 and Glutathione S-transferase is coupled to oxidized polymannose. The dendritic cells are the orchestrators of the immune system. ‚ÄòPriming‚Äô dendritic cells involves exposing those cells to disease antigens in order to get the immune system to properly recognise the antigen and mount an appropriate response. With CVac this takes place outside the body of the patient (ex vivo), with dendritic cells obtained by leukapheresis. The antigen in this case is MUC1, known to be overexpressed on a variety of cancer cells and in CVac MUC1 is conjugated to the carbohydrate mannan to facilitate uptake by the dendritic cells. CVAc can be administered subcutaneously, whereas Provenge is intravenous.  Early development in Melbourne  CVac originated in the mid-1990s at the Austin Research Institute, a medical research facility then associated with Melbourne's Austin Hospital (and that merged with the Burnet Institute in 2006). The original version of the product was developed in the laboratory of the Austin Professor Ian McKenzie in 1993. CVac therapy was originally intended to be in vivo but the Austin researchers started getting better results in ex vivo therapy.  Development by Prima BioMed  Prima BioMed was formed around 2001 to commercialise a number of Austin Research Institute projects including CVac. The company was taken public in July 2001 on the ASX in a reverse takeover of a defunct mineral explorer called Prima Resources. CVac ultimately ended up as Prima BioMed's core project until Prima's acquisition of the French biotechnology company Immutep SA in 2014.  Dubai Approval  CVac was approved for use by the Dubai Health City Authority in May 2011.  Manufacturing  CVac was manufactured in Germany by Fraunhofer IZI (Das Fraunhofer-Institut f√ºr Zelltherapie und Immunologie), an institute of the Fraunhofer Society in Leipzig, Saxony The Fraunhofer IZI was authorized to manufacture the treatment in Europe in late 2011 after meeting criteria laid down by the German Arzneimittelgesetz (Drug Law). Prima intended that its product would be manufactured at this one central location, with patient blood being flown to Leipzig and primed dendritic cells being shipped back to the relevant trial site.

The Draco Foundation promotes democracy and the preservation of natural justice through two operational arms: Council Watch and the National Residents' Associations Database. These activities, along with the Foundation itself, are non-partisan and funded through private donations. All the work performed by the Trust is adopts a community-centric approach and is run by volunteers. Draco Foundation aims to educate the public about how the law works, especially around local government. They undertake research, hold forums and conferences, publish articles, and bring people from the civil society sector together. The Trust operates in the civil society sector, mainly with residents associations. Draco funds Council Watch - a website that improves transparency, accountability and best practice in local government - and also the National Residents' Association Database. Notable Activities In 2010 the Trust convened the first national conference for New Zealand residents' and ratepayers' associations, at the Grand Hall of parliament buildings, Wellington. That same year the Trust appealed a decision by the Charities Commission to refuse registration as a charitable entity. The appeal was rejected by the court in a decision by Ronald Young J, handed down on 15 February 2011.http://www.nzlii.org/nz/cases/NZHC/2011/368.html Historical Reference The Foundation is named after Draco, the first lawgiver of ancient Athens. His contribution to democracy was considerable, as he replaced oral laws (known only to a special class, arbitrarily applied and interpreted) with written laws; thus made known to all literate citizens, who could make appeal to the rulers of Athens for injustices. Draco's legal code was very stringent (leading to the term \\"Draconian\\"). However the Draco Foundation does not advocate for draconian laws in the modern sense of the word. Rather it supports the application of the law equally to all citizens and organisations: including agents of the Government - in the true spirit of Draco's approach to justice.

It was named after Prahlada and dedicated to the Hindu deity Narasimha. The temple is presently in ruins, since its destruction in 1992 by a Muslim mob in retaliation for the destruction of the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya, India by a Hindu mob earlier that year. History =Founding= The original temple of Prahladpuri is said to have been built by Prahlada, son of Hiranyakashipu, the king of Multan (Kashya-papura) in honor of Narsing Avatar, an incarnation of Hindu deity Vishnu, who emerged from the pillar to save Prahlada. Survey & Studies for Conservation of Historical Monuments of Multan. Department of Archeology & Museums, Ministry of Culture, Government of Pakistan =Early= The Prahladpuri temple like the Sun Temple of Multan suffered several material losses and was reduced to a nondescript shrine by the 19th century. It is located on top of a raised platform inside the Fort of Multan, adjacent to tomb of Baha‚Äôul Haq Zakariya. A mosque has subsequently built adjacent to temple. =Sikh era= In 1810, the height of the temple was significantly raised, which lead to tensions with the Muslim community. The records suggested by Dr. A.N. Khan say that temple was once rebuilt in the decade of 1810, when the area was under the rule of Sikhs. However, Alexander Burnes, who visited the temple in 1831, said that he found it deserted and without a roof. In his memoir \\"Travels into Bokhara\\", he describes the Pyladpooree temple as a low building supported by wooden pillars, with Hanuman and Ganesha as guardians to its portal. He further quotes \\"It is the only place of Hindoo worship in Mooltan; we were denied entrance to it\\". Later, in year 1849, when British laid siege of Multan Fort against Mul Raj, a shell fired by British army fell on gunpowder store within the fort, thus destroying almost all of the fort except the mausoleums of Bahauddin Zakaria and his sons and the Prahladpuri temple complex.MONUMENTS OF MULTAN Survey & Studies for Conservation of Historical Monuments of Multan. Department of Archaeology & Museums, Ministry of Culture, Government of Pakistan Alexander Cunningham described this temple as it was seen in 1853 by him who wrote that: ‚ÄúIt was a square brick building with some very finely carved wooden pillars for the support of the roof.Cunningham, 129 =Colonial era= The present temple was first built in 1861 by Mahant Bawl Ram Das at cost of Rs.11,000 by way of public donation and again in 1872 by the subsequent Mahanta of Prahladpuri temple with donations from Thakur Dawara Fateh Chand Tanksalia and other Hindu citizens of Multan.  1881 Riot  In 1881 while renovating the temple, a major dispute arose between Hindus & Muslims over the height of shikhara of the temple which was to be raised higher than the dome of the adjacent shrine of Bahauddin Zakariya, which was opposed by local Muslims. Hindus also became vehemently opposed the sale of beef in the city, with the beef controversy eclipsing the temple controversy. On 20 September 1881, a communal riot erupted over the temple's height and sale of beef, resulting in 50,000 rupees worth of damage. Hindu rioters burned a mosque in the city's bazaar and attacked the Walli Muhammadi Mosque and burned a Quran, which was then retaliated for by a Muslim mob 2 hours later that then attacked Prahladpuri Temple and burnt it. The entire contingent of British troops from Multan Cantonment were called out to control the mobs. However, the temple was renovated with funds raised by Hindu community of Multan and was managed by the community.Ajudhia Das, who was formerly Mahant of two temples at Multan named Prahlad and N'arasingpuri, was removed from his office on January 23rd, 1913, by a Panchayat appointed at a mass meeting of Hindus which was convened on that date. All India reporter, Volume 3 by D.V. Chitaley, 1923 = Post Independence = After the creation of Pakistan, most Hindus migrated to the newly independent Republic of India and the affairs of temple were managed by minority Hindus of city. The original idols of Lord Narasimha were taken to India by Baba Narayan Das Batra from Multan at the time of independence in 1947. They are now placed in a temple at Haridwar. =Retaliatory destruction= In 1992, the temple was destroyed by a Muslim mob in retaliation for the destruction of Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, India by a Hindu mob who claimed the site was the exact location where Ram was born.https://www.sci.gov.in/pdf/JUD_2.pdf Architecture The temple was built on a high platform inside Multan Fort and was before 1992 a prominent landmark of Multan. It had a main hall, circumlocutory and skylights and a large mandapa. The central hall had a replica of idol under a baldachin. Adjacent to temple was dharamshala complex. Traditions, however, claim that the original temple was a columnar structure and both the roof and the columns supporting it were made of pure gold. It is further stated that for some unknown reason, this entire building sank into ground and over it was built a new temple.Latif, 54 Significance The temple is of ancient origin and is located on the site where the original temple is said to have been built by Prahlada himself. It is the place where the Lord Narasimha is said to have appeared out of pillar to save him from his father Hiranyakashyapa. The Hindus, therefore, believe the tradition and the festival of Holika Dahan started here. Conservation The temple is in ruins since its destruction by violent Muslim mob in 1992. In 2006, on occasion of Urs of Baha-ud-din Zakariya, the minister of government, ordered construction of facilities for Wuzu and in 2008 facilities for Langar in premises of temple. These actions were later protested by some NGOs as according to the Constitution of Pakistan, no Muslim construction can be done within the places of worship of other religions. A case was filed and court ordered stay on construction. The matter is still pending in court. Many peaceful protests were held by minority organizations and many persons and organizations have requested Government of Pakistan to restore this ancient temple of importance.

Structure  Structure new One type of fiber optic temperature probe consists of a gallium arsenide (GaAs) semiconductor crystal that is mounted on the end of an optical fiber. The probe is completely non-metallic. The fiber optical sensor is completely non-conductive and offers complete immunity to RFI, EMI, NMR and microwave radiation with high temperature operating capability, intrinsic safety, and non-invasive use. . Website producer fiber optical thermometers - Optocon AG. retrieved 10 April 2012.  Measurement principle  The principle of operation is based on the temperature dependence of the band gap of GaAs. The GaAs crystal fixed on the tip of the fiber will be transparent at a wavelength above 850nm. The position of the band edge is temperature dependent and is shifted about 0.4nm/K. The light is directed via the optical fiber to the crystal, where it is absorbed and partially reflected back into the fiber. A miniature spectrometer provides a spectrum with the position of the band edge, from which the temperature is calculated.Dr. rer. nat. Claus Renschen: Unverzichtbares Messverfahren. In:'MSR Magazin 5/2007  Applications  = Medical = MRI Tomograph Fiber optic sensors offer complete immunity to RF and microwave radiation with high temperature operating capability, so they can be used for measurement on patients and materials in magnetic resonance scanner (MRI). In strong magnetic fields there is a small offset in the temperature reading approximately proportional to the strength of the magnetic field squared. The magnitude of the offset is also affected by the orientation of the GaAs crystal within the magnetic field, the geometry of the GaAs crystal, and impurities in the GaAs. Metallic sensors can breed errors at the image acquisition. For special cancer treatment sensors with a diameter of 0.5mm are available. These can be used minimal invasive for monitoring of tissue temperature. Another application of fiber optical measurement technique is laser therapy. Through an endoscope laser energy is coupled and the temperature will be measured via a fiber optic probe at the location of therapy. . Website Agil Leipzig - Transferbrief. retrieved 10 April 2012. = Environmental = Industrial areas often contaminate the soil with oil, toxic and persistent organic compounds. To clear these fields, soil heating by radio waves is frequently used. Fiber optical sensors are deployed to monitor and control this process. A high- power generator will deliver energy in radio frequency range. The polluted soil is covered with electrodes, which will heat the surface dielectric. Besides, several fiber optical probes are put in the soil. Depending on the measured value different values of temperature and temperature distribution can be realized in the soil. Depending on the level of contamination the temperature will be increased slightly to activate a higher decomposition of soil organisms, alternatively the soil water will condensate in a temperature range up to 150¬∞C together with non-steam resistant organic contaminations. A perforated soil air extraction system takes the steams away and recirculates them into a filter system.. Website producer fiber optical thermometers - Optocon AG. retrieved 10 April 2012. = Chemical and petrochemical = Fiber optic temperature probes are designed to withstand harsh and corrosive environments. The sensors are intrinsically safe. There are no components which create sparks, leading to explosions. They consist of completely non- conductive components and can therefore be used in hazardous areas. They can have a length up to 2.5 miles, so that the analysis can be placed outside the hazardous area. = Microwave and radiofrequency environments = In microwave heated installations chemical digestion under pressure and temperature for the determination of trace and ultra-trace analysis in downstream processes will be executed, for that reason it was found that under certain pressure and temperature conditions, the yield or efficiency of extraction or digestion processes could be significantly improved. So fiber optical temperature sensors are the only way to control temperatures in microwave chemistry. = Generator and transformer = Generating Station The claims of a modern society relating to electricity requirement approach the full capacity of the generating stations. To ensure industrial safety the temperature must be tightly controlled. High power generators are often filled with hydrogen in order to cool effectively. Besides the heavily contaminated electromagnetic environment the risk for explosions is high. Only fiber optical thermometer can be used for measurement in these areas. = Wood drying = In the renovation of wooden structures can control the core temperature of the wood on a fiber-optic temperature probe beams in place. The thermal drying of wood components in the installed state between 80 and 95¬∞C is sufficient to effect the dry rot infestation to combat and prevent damage. The probes used for temperature measurement consist of a jacketed PTFE glass fibers with a GaAs crystals (gallium arsenide) tip and are completely non-metallic. = Electric motors = In the industry, the machinery and equipment is increasing to the limits of their strength exhausted.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005 as the Poverty Island Light Station. History In 1864, the railroad connection between Escanaba and Negaunee was completed, allowing iron ore to be easily transported to the southern shore of the Upper Peninsula. Shipping traffic into Escanaba immediately increased, which also increased the traffic through the relatively narrow Poverty Island Passage near the southern shore of Poverty island. The Poverty Island Passage was hazardous to traverse after dark, so in 1867 the Lighthouse Board requested funds to build a lighthouse on the southern tip of Poverty Island. However, Congress did not appropriate funds, some $18,000, until 1873. Work on the light began the same year; however a late season fire destroyed some of the building material stored near the partially completed lighthouse. Work continued in 1874, but the tower was only partially completed before funds ran out. A temporary light was installed. After an additional $3,000 was appropriated, the light station was completed in 1875. The permanent light, with its fourth order Fresnel lens, was finally lit on August 10, 1875. In 1885, a fog signal station was constructed nearby. In 1894, an iron oil house and docks were constructed. The light was automated in 1957 and the buildings abandoned. The light was deactivated in 1976 after another light was installed in a skeletal steel tower nearby. The cast iron lantern was removed from the tower and discarded nearby along with other lighthouse equipment. In the 1980s the lantern was rescued by the Delta County Historical Society, who used it to refurbish the Sand Point Light in Escanaba. The lighthouse remains abandoned, and in 2011 was declared by Lighthouse Digest to be \\"America‚Äôs Most Endangered Lighthouse.\\" Description The Poverty Island Light was designed to be a near duplicate of the Sturgeon Point Light. The tower is high, with the light installed in a cast iron lantern at above the ground. A wood frame and brick keeper's quarters is attached.

The process was first used in his film A Place to Stand, produced for the Ontario pavilion at Expo 67, held in Montreal.  Background  The 1956 Associated British-Pathe fantasy/science-fiction release The Door in the Wall (dir. Glenn Alvey, screenplay by Alvey and H.G. Wells) can be seen as a primitive forerunner of Chapman's technique. Using what it announced as ‚ÄúThe Dynamic Frame - in which the shape and size of the picture change according to the dramatic needs of the story\\",British Pathe the film displayed, however, neither movement of image panels nor multiplicity or division of images. Chapman felt ‚Äúit was clear that its failure was creative, not technical‚Äù and decided against advice to employ this matting technique when making a film for the Telephone Association Pavilion at Expo 67.The birth of A Place to Stand, Christopher Chapman/How to make or not to make a Canadian film, Andr√© P√¢quet (ed), La Cin√©math√®que canadienne, 1968 Scene from Christopher Chapman's A Place to Stand (1967) premiering the multi-dynamic image technique Chapman initially had great difficulties with the technical aspects of his expanded concept for A Place to Stand and almost gave up on the idea as a result; in his own words, he \\"had nothing to read about how to do it.\\" Working from 350 pages of notes,The Personal Vision of Christopher Chapman, CM, RCA, CSC, CFE, Ontario Film Institute; 1989 interview published March, 2010 he was limited to editing on a two-picture-head moviola, so that only two images could be viewed simultaneously; he ‚Äúcould never 'see' the film develop.‚Äù Shots were viewed ‚Äúwith an eye to vertical frames and horizontal frames, odd frames, small frames and large frames.‚Äù It was important to also shoot material that would be of limited interest, so as not to confuse the viewer with too many visual stimuli. Editing required close attention to where the various images would direct the viewer's gaze.Leslie Scrivener, \\"Forty years on, a song retains its standing\\", Toronto Star April 22, 2007. The technique as employed in A Place to Stand displayed as many as 15 images at a time. In this way, the under-18-minute film contained an actual hour-and-a-half of footage. The dimensions of the original screen used were 66 feet or 20.12 m (wide) by 30 feet or 9.14 m (high). Unlike other multi-image films, it did not require special equipment or a special theatre.Westland Expo 67  Response The film and its innovative technique enjoyed great immediate popularity. It was seen by an estimated two million at Expo 67 and was later distributed to theatres, ultimately reaching an audience of an estimated 100 million in North America and Europe.Expo 67 A Place to Stand was nominated in two categories at the 1967 40th Academy Awards presented on April 10, 1968, Best Documentary Short Subject and Best Live Action Short Subject, winning in the latter. It also won Chapman the Canadian Film Award (later to become the Genie Awards) for Film of the Year (and additionally won for Best Non-Feature Sound-Editing).IMDb, Awards for A Place to Stand Chapman himself was ultimately appointed to the Order of Canada in 1987.The Governor General of Canada, Order of Canada, Christopher Martin Chapman, C.M., R.C.A.  Influence  Scene from The Thomas Crown Affair (1968) demonstrating one example of the multi-dynamic image technique Prints of Chapman's film were purchased for viewing by executives, producers and directors by almost all of the major studios in Hollywood. The technique has inspired many films and television series, most notably Norman Jewison's 1968 film The Thomas Crown Affair. Steve McQueen, star of the film, was on hand for the premiere screening of A Place to Stand at the Todd-AO studios in Hollywood, and personally told an unsure Chapman (who \\"thought it was a failure\\") that he was highly impressed; the following year, Norman Jewison had incorporated the technique into the film, inserting the scenes into the already finished product. (Chapman later dissuaded a ‚Äúvery disappointed‚Äù McQueen from using the technique in his 1971 vehicle Le Mans, claiming ‚Äúit was much too big a film, with too many writers; it wouldn't work that way.‚Äù He has stated that ‚Äúmany filmmakers then adopted multi-dynamic image even though few understood it.‚Äù) The Boston Strangler, also from 1968 (director Richard Fleischer), has several long multi-frame sequences clearly based on Chapman's original in terms of arrangement and rhythm; here, however, the panes remain static and do not show identical images in simultaneous multiplicity. Fleischer used the technique again, this time with subdivided images and moving panes closer to Chapman's original, in the title sequence to his 1973 film Soylent Green. Chapman's innovation found quick favour in late 1960s and 1970s television, notably in title sequences. Mannix, Barnaby Jones, Kojak, Medical Center, Dallas, Phyllis, Lancelot Link, Me and the Chimp, The Brady Bunch and The Bob Newhart Show (beginning with the fifth season in 1976-77) are all examples of the technique being used in opening credits to some extent, whether approximately as in A Place to Stand or combined with regular film sequences (as with the latter). Indeed, the multi-dynamic image technique has been referred to in the press as the \\"Brady Bunch effect\\". The Globe and Mail, Obituary: \\"Christopher Chapman, Oscar Winner who invented 'Brady Bunch' effect\\"The Hollywood Reporter, \\"Oscar-Winning Creator of 'The Brady Bunch' Effect Dies at 88\\" The more contemporary U.S. action drama TV series 24 as well as the Canadian documentary series Final 24 both also use the technique. More broadly, the multi-dynamic image technique has been credited with laying the groundwork for the IMAX format.tiff: Canadian Film Encyclopedia See also * Multi-image * Split screen (filmmaking) References Category:Expo 67 Category:1967 in Canada Category:Canadian inventions Category:Cinematic techniques Category:Special effects ","title":"Multi-dynamic image technique"},{"id":"35432040","text":"The Dorchester Area Schools Partnership (DASP) is a group of 19 schools in the Dorchester area.

It manufactures ostomy and orthotic products. Salts Healthcare has a network of customer care centres that provide home delivery of all stoma and incontinence products. These centres also provide advisors and stoma care nurses to support their prescription customers.  History of Salts Healthcare  Brothers John and William Salt started out as apprentice locksmiths in Wolverhampton in the early 1700s. Using the skills gained from his apprenticeship, John Salt became a well established surgeons' instrument maker and cutler. He handed the business over to his son William Salt in 1755 who had been learning the family trade as a journeyman with Mr. La Roche in Silver Street London. Manufacturing surgeons' instruments remained the focus of the business but because surgeons' instruments are not replaced often, Salts started manufacturing new medical devices. After William's death in 1793 the business was passed onto Richard Salt who in the 1800s relocated the factory to larger premises in Dale End, Birmingham. Richard Salt opened a second site in Coleshill Street. The death of Richard forced quite a remarkable change in the business, with Sarah (Richard's wife) taking control for a short while. She then handed the business over to Thomas Partridge Salt. Thomas died at the age of 45 during a Cholera epidemic. In 1845 the business was once again moved to bigger premises by Mary and Thomas Partridge II, to Bull Street. During this period the factory was moved to Cherry Street. By the end of the 19th century, trade in Birmingham was improving and so was the Salts' business, achieving the Royal Seal of Approval and becoming in 1845 Cutlers to Her Majesty. Still focusing on surgeons' instruments and truss manufacture in 1863 Salts was granted the Royal Warrant to become Cutlers to the Emperor of the French in 1867. In that same year Salts was awarded an Honorable Mention at the Paris Universal Exhibition. The business now being led by Thomas Partridge II along with Ashton T. Salt was manufacturing a wide range of appliances and attending to various conditions, from amputations to back complaints. Thomas Partridge II, being an expert in his field even published the books: A practical treatise on rupture: Its Causes, Management and Cure, and Various Mechanical Contrivances Employed for its Relief, and A Treatise on Deformities and Debilities of the Lower Extremities. Manufacturing surgical instruments and anatomical mechanicians left Salts relatively unaffected by the economic depression of 1866‚Äì1868, being able to cease cutlery manufacture in the last quarter of the 19th century, to focus on the manufacture of Orthopedic devices. This led to the patent of the Orthonemic Truss. Demand for medical products continued to grow into the early 20th century and with the outbreak of World War One Salts found itself manufacturing artificial limbs for serviceman injured during the war. 1945 brought about changes to the National Health Service which led to contract changes for limb makers, leaving Salts looking to change its focus. Three years later Professor Brian Brooke from Birmingham General Hospital approached Salts to see if it could make collection devices similar to the ones he had seen produced in the US. When requests to the American manufacturer for a supply or licensing agreement failed Salts decided to manufacture a limited range of handmade \\"collection\\" bags. Although manufacturing the bags was not very profitable, Salts looked to improve the lifestyle of stoma patients, which led to the research and development of an entire range of stoma care products. Today Salts functions with a head office and distribution centre in Birmingham and two Salt family brothers playing an active role in the business.

The festival was founded by Stefan Metz, cellist of Orlando Quartet. Since its foundation, Orlando has made an important contribution to the development and promotion of chamber music in the Netherlands and abroad. Two events are organized annually: the ten-day Orlando Festival during the summer and the Orlando winter course with four teaching days during the winter/spring . Characteristic of the Orlando Festival is the combination of chamber music concerts and education for amateur musicians of all levels and all ages, aimed at young professional musicians. Since the first edition in 1982, the heart of the Orlando Festival has been in Abbey Hotel and Conference Rolduc in Kerkrade, where all participants stay, and where the afternoon concerts, lessons, master classes and workshops take place. The ten Orlando evening concerts, performed by approximately 30 international and renowned chamber musicians, partly take place on other stages in Limburg and the Euregion, such as Parkstad Limburg Theater Kerkrade, Kloosterbibliotheek Wittem and the Sint Janskerk in Maastricht. The Orlando Festival has a national appearance but is also rooted in the region. The young ensembles and vocalists of the masterclass provide approximately 20 regional concerts in beautiful locations. The special and successful Orlando formula - versatile programming, high performance level, concerts in combination with education - makes the Orlando Festival unique, not only in the Netherlands, but also worldwide. With approximately 100 events in ten days, the Orlando Festival focuses on audiences from the Euregion and the Netherlands, and festival visitors and active participants from all over the Netherlands and abroad. The radio stations Radio 4, L1 and De Concertzender record almost all Orlando concerts for later broadcast, reaching an estimated 200,000 listeners annually. Orlando also annually produces 1 to 2 compact discs with (live) recordings of interesting parts of the festival program.  History of the Orlando Festival  Poster Orlando 30 yearsIn 2011, the Orlando Festival celebrated its 30th anniversary, with Stefan Metz saying goodbye as director and artistic director. With the arrival of Maarten Mostert, a new period began for the Orlando Festival. In 2012 a new set-up was carried out, whereby there was no longer a pronounced youth and adult week, but all participants were present at Rolduc simultaneously. From September 2014 Henk Guittart is the artistic director of the Orlando Festival. On December 1st, 2015, he was appointed Director / Artistic Director of the Chamber Music Limburg Foundation, responsible producer of the Orlando Festival.  Orlando musicians  The Orlando Festival welcomes a large group of professional musicians every year. The musicians teach participating ensembles of all levels during the day, from amateurs to young professional ensembles. The musicians also provide the afternoon and evening concerts at the Orlando Festival. Regularly returning ensembles include Rusquartet, Nemtsov Duo and Osiris Trio. Since 2015, the Gruppo Montebello has been a resident at the Orlando Festival. Gruppo Montebello was the name for ensemble projects conducted by Henk Guittart at the various conservatories where he worked from 1991 to 2011. (The Italian \\"Montebello\\" means \\"beautiful mountain\\" and in German: Sch√∂nberg.)Gruppo Montebello at the Orlando Festival 2019 (Photo by S√©nen Fern√°ndez Garc√≠a)Since 2011, when this plan started in Canada, the name Gruppo Montebello has been used exclusively for an ensemble with carefully selected professional chamber musicians with whom Guittart realizes his long-term projects: performing and recording the large ensemble compositions of the three composers of the Second Viennese School: Arnold Sch√∂nberg, Anton Webern and Alban Berg for CD. And recordings of the complete chamber music arrangements of orchestral works, which arose during the years of the Verein f√ºr musikalische Privatauff√ºhrungen, founded in Wien and Prague from 1918 to 1924 by Arnold Sch√∂nberg, as well as later arrangements of symphonic repertoire for small, single instrumentations.  Rolduc Abbey  Rolduc Abbey, Kerkrade The Orlando Festival, as international chamber music festival, has been linked to festival location Rolduc since 1982. This unique venue contributes greatly to the unique Orlando experience. The building breathes 900 years of history, which is immediately perceptible when you enter the impressive courtyard. The collection of buildings, gardens and courtyards has a total acreage of 8,5 hectare, whilst the whole property, including a vineyard, totals 35 hectare. Rolduc is the largest abbey complex in the Benelux and is on the UNESCO list of 100 most important monuments in our country. Rolduc is located in the beautiful South Limburg, close to the border with Germany and only a short distance away from Belgium. Cities such as Maastricht, Heerlen, Aachen and Valkenburg are located less than half an hour away. Not far from the abbey there are beautiful nature areas such as the Wormdal or the Anstelvallei with its slope forests, monumental farms, crystal clear stream and panoramic views of the Cranenweyer reservoir via the various hiking and cycling routes.  Orlando European Summer Course for Chamber Music (OESC)  From the summer of 2021 the Orlando Festival hosts the Orlando European Summer Course for Chamber Music (OESC). OESC offers young artists from the countries of the European Union in chamber music ensembles (2 to 9 musicians) an intensive course of about 30 hours of specialised education. OESC takes place during the 10 days of the annual Orlando Festival, with chamber music lessons, master classes and coaching in several essential other skills. Participation includes also the opportunity to perform at regional concerts and at the Orlando concerts. OESC presents a variety of opportunities to grow and learn in many different aspects of music making. This includes musical subjects such as HIP (historically informed performance) from baroque to 20th century repertoire, and all kinds of useful techniques and skills such as efficiency in rehearsing, knowledge of learning development, communication within the ensemble and dealing with mental and physical stress. OESC is designed for ensembles consisting of Bachelor and Master students and for young professional chamber music ensembles (from duo to nonet, for all classical instrumentalists and vocalists).  Orlando winter course  During the Orlando winter course, amateur musicians receive inspiring and stimulating lessons in teamwork. They learn how to make music together with others, they work on the important parts of the ensemble playing and on efficiently studying new repertoire. The course is aimed at amateurs of all ages and all levels, from beginners to advanced. Accompanied by professional chamber music teachers, a composition is rehearsed during four rehearsal mornings, which are performed at a concluding concert.

Left to right (front row): Yukio, Rin and Shiemi. Left to right (back row): Konekomaru, Shura, Izumo, Suguro/Bon, Mephisto and Shima. The fictional characters from the manga and anime series Blue Exorcist were created by Kazue Kato. The story revolves around Rin Okumura, a teenager who discovers he is the son of the god demon Satan, born from a human woman and the inheritor of Satan's powers. When Rin's guardian dies while fighting Satan, Rin decides to become an exorcist in order to defeat his father. Entering into the True Cross Academy to learn how to fight demons, Rin meets several other exorcist apprentices whom he starts to bond with. Critical reception to the characters has been positive for their traits and interactions. Main characters =Rin Okumura= is the sixteen-year-old protagonist of the story. He is a son of Satan, born from a human woman and is the inheritor of Satan's powers. His powers were sealed at birth into the demon-slaying blade by Mephisto Pheles, the True Cross Academy principal, allowed him to live a normal human life for nearly 16 years with his twin brother Yukio and his foster father Shiro Fujimoto. Rin becomes aware of his true identity after Kurikara can no longer seal his powers, setting off a chain of events that lead to the death of Shiro at the hands of Satan, who attempts to drag Rin back to the demon realm, Gehenna. Mephisto Pheles later confronts Rin, who demands that Mephisto let him join the exorcists to fight against the demons. Mephisto personally enrolls Rin into the True Cross Academy so that Rin can pursue his goal to obtain the title of \\"Meister\\" in Knight, then become a Paladin and defeat Satan. He also wants to earn Yukio's respect. While currently an Esquire, Rin wishes to obtain the highest rank of an Exorcist, Paladin, to prove Fujimoto did not want to use him as a weapon. Rin is also a good cook, preparing meals for himself and Yukio. Rin can access the power he has inherited from Satan through drawing Kurikara. The sheath acts as a portal to Gehenna, which, when the blade is drawn, returns Rin to his demon form. While in his human form, Rin exhibits a number of physical traits that are signs of his demonic nature that are intensified in the demon forms. In both forms, Rin can control incredibly destructive bright blue flames, the trademark sign of anything related to Satan. However, when he draws Kurikara, the magnitude of the flames dramatically increases and often leads to Rin being \\"consumed\\" by his own flames and losing his mind. Rin later meets a spirit named Kongo Ucchusma who teaches him how to control his flames (in the anime, this was changed to Shura and Yukio who helped him). Rin also has a Cat Sith, Kuro, who was initially Shiro's, as his familiar, and it has 2 tails like a nekomata. When Yukio awakened Satan's power in his eyes and shot him, the demon part of Rin awakens and for a moment takes over his body and nearly kill his friends when he unleash the full power of Satan's flame until Rin takes back control. The resulting awakening caused Rin's appearance to change to similar in appearance with his demonic self. Rin is voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto in Japanese and by Bryce Papenbrook in English, while in VOMIC he is voiced by Daisuke Namikawa. In the Blue Exorcist musical, he was portrayed by Ryou Kimura. =Yukio Okumura= is Rin's younger fraternal twin brother. When it was discovered that the woman impregnated by Satan was going to have twins, it was believed that Satan's powers would be split between them. Due to the weakness of Yukio's body, however, he did not inherit any of Satan's power, thus being born fully human with the full extent of Satan's powers going to Rin. Yukio did, however, receive a spirit wound at birth from his brother, which allowed him to be aware of demons for as long as he can remember. Yukio secretly trained to become an Exorcist from the age of seven in order to protect Rin through the help of Fujimoto. While both Yukio and Rin are in their first year at True Cross Academy, Yukio is already an instructor at the Exorcist cram school teaching Anti-Demon Pharmacology to Rin's class. It is often stated that Yukio is considered a prodigy, having already acquired the title \\"Meister\\" in both the Dragoon and Doctor class, while ordinarily most people would aim for Meister in only one class (both are still fully qualified exorcists). He is currently ranked a Middle First class exorcist. Though it is shown that Yukio had once cared for his brother, after beginning to train to become an exorcist to protect Rin, he begins to loathe his brother due to Rin's special treatment as the son of Satan with powers and blames him for their adoptive father's death, which adds to the fire fueling his resentment. However, as the series goes by, Yukio starts to care about his brother like he did before. Fearing Rin will be consumed by his demonic nature, Yukio often berates him for his impulsive actions and reckless attitude. Despite being usually kind, it is shown that he has a somewhat sadistic side that he hides. During the fight against Todo, Yukio discovers he also inherited Satan's flame through his eyes that unconsciously protects him whenever he was near death. The discovery causes Yukio to be obsessed to know the truth behind his and Rin's birth. After reading the file sent by Lightning that contains the Order of True Cross' secret, Yukio came to believe that Shiro never loved him and only raised him to become a living weapon while his brother was loved because he completely inherited Satan's power. His obsession to find out the truth and jealousy towards Rin leads Yukio to join Illuminati. In the anime, It is changed so that he has the powers of Satan although this is not canon. He is voiced by Jun Fukuyama in Japanese and by Johnny Yong Bosch in English, while in VOMIC he is voiced by Ry≈´ichi Kijima. In the Blue Exorcist musical, he was portrayed by Kimito Totani. Exorcists =Shiemi Moriyama= is the daughter of the woman who runs an Exorcist-only shop. She is kind and has an abiding love of gardening, but often lacks confidence in herself. Before the series, Shiemi never went out of her home and tended to the garden with her grandmother. After her grandmother died, Rin and Yukio exorcise the demon that was leeching her life force and she decides to become an Exorcist. She is currently an Esquire and with Yukio's help, she later passes the exams to study in the Academy's regular classes as well. Initially, Shiemi scored poorly in tests despite her upbringing, but it was soon discovered that she was using the names that she has created herself. After learning to use official names, Shiemi's grades went up. At first while at the academy, Shiemi only talked with Rin and Yukio, but she eventually comes to amicable terms with Ryuji, Konekomaru, and Renzo. She also earns Izumo's friendship despite being initially used and mistreated by her. Shiemi becomes devastated upon learning Rin's secret, feeling she is not trustworthy enough to them to have initially included her with this knowledge. However, on the Kyoto mission, she reconciles with Rin upon seeing how much he is suffering as a result of his nature. Shiemi has the talent to become a Tamer and can summon a reliable Greenman spirit that can produce healing herbs and plant-related barriers. Shiemi is shown to have great inner strength as she can keep her Greenman around for extended periods without tiring. Her Greenman is able to understand her way of naming plants and is able to produce the correct one when asked. Shiemi admits that she doesn't really understand the difference between romantic love and friendship due to her isolated childhood and still considers herself too young for love. However, after Yukio left and Rin was nearly killed by his own flame, Shiemi realized that she has been in love with Rin all along. She is voiced by Kana Hanazawa in Japanese and by Christine Marie Cabanos in English. In the Blue Exorcist musical, she was portrayed by Ari Nakajima. =Ryuji Suguro= (nicknamed ) is a stubborn and hot-tempered individual. Despite his delinquent appearance and attitude, he is very hardworking and the best student in class. Ryuji is the heir to the Cursed Temple in Kyoto. Because of the destruction of the temple in the Blue Night and his anger towards his father Tatsuma Suguro, he swears he will defeat Satan and rebuild his Temple. When Rin's identity is revealed, Ryuji, along most of his classmates start avoiding him, but after a confrontation with his father and Rin, Ryuji and his classmates help Rin escape impending execution and reconciles with him, claiming that he only blames Rin for not trusting his friends with his secret. During the battle with the Impure King he inherits a familiar named Karura (a phoenix like demon which has the ability to use strong amount of red flames to incinerate almost everything and reincarnate when it dies) from his father Tatsuma Suguro, he uses its power to create a Gouhaen (a fire-element barrier) in order to prevent any miasma coming out from the Impure King from spreading further. Ryuji is currently an Esquire just like Rin and the others, trying to achieve Meister in both Aria and Dragoon. He later becomes Lightning's apprentice, as at this point Bon had lost his direction in life and needed a new path to follow. He is voiced by Kazuya Nakai in Japanese and by Kyle Hebert in English. In the Blue Exorcist musical, he was portrayed by Y≈´ki Tomotsune. =Renzo Shima= is a very carefree yet fearful character. He is very loyal to Bon and Konekomaru, since they both grew up with him at the Cursed Temple in Kyoto. Renzo is the second of the cast who accepts Rin after discovering his identity, finding ignoring Rin to be troublesome. He is obsessed with women, and particularly infatuated with Izumo. In elementary school, he was referred to as the \\"Erotic Demon\\". Now that he is in high-school, he is trying to be more refined. His hair is naturally black, but he dyed it pink (to the chagrin of his father). Renzo carries a K'rik (Khakkhara) staff to fight like his two brothers and plans to achieve the Meister in Aria. Later in the manga, it is revealed that Renzo has all this time hidden his true abilities as he is capable of summoning high level demons to do his bidding. However, using said summoning really drains him. Revealing himself as an spy for Illuminati, Renzo abandons the Academy and returns to the organization, but later his brother confides to Rin and the others that he is in fact a double agent recruited by Mephisto, eventually returning to his friends' side. Despite he claims that he was on the True Cross' side all along, there is lingering doubts among the members of the order regarding his true loyalty. He is voiced by K≈çji Yusa in Japanese and Brian Beacock in English. In the Blue Exorcist musical, he was portrayed by Kazuki Watanabe. =Konekomaru Miwa= is a timid but brilliant individual, able to come up with complex strategies in a short window of time. He is very loyal to Ryuji and Renzo, as they had grown up together at the same Temple in Kyoto. He is kind to everyone, but it takes a long time for him to reconcile with Rin after discovering his secret, despite seeing his true character. He is an orphan and the surviving head of the Miwa family. He plans to achieve the Meister in Aria. In the anime, a crow demon took advantage of Konekomaru's fear of Rin and possessed him, before Rin is able to save Konekomaru. He is voiced by Y≈´ki Kaji in Japanese and Miki Moran in English. In the Blue Exorcist musical, he was portrayed by Jun Muruyama. =Izumo Kamiki= Hailing from a family of shrine maidens dedicated to the deity Inari, is easily one of the best students and she is aware of it. She has a tsundere attitude and is offensive towards everyone except her childhood friend Noriko Paku, who was the only one in her elementary school who would talk to her. Very prideful and often difficult to talk to, Izumo does care about her fellow Esquire and is the first of Rin's classmates to accept Rin after his identity as Satan's son was revealed. Izumo attempts to achieve a Meister in Tamer, and can summon two Kitsune (foxes) to fight for her. During the school festival, Izumo is captured by Renzo after he reveals himself as an spy from Illuminati. Izumo's past is also revealed; the kitsune she summons actually lived with her family for generations. Her mother loved Izumo and her sister dearly, but accidentally caused herself to become possessed by the nine-tailed fox when her boyfriend rejected her. Izumo called the Illuminati for help and they took over her shrine for their own nefarious purposes. After realizing that she has been tricked but was powerless to do anything, she reluctantly attends True Cross Academy as an exorcist student to become a new vessel for the nine- tailed fox in exchange Illuminati won't harm her sister. When she was forced to move the nine-tailed fox from her mother into herself, Izumo finally admitted how much she loves the friends she made during her time at the academy and accepted their help. Once she was rescued and found her sister safe but forgot about her, Izumo determines to stop pitying herself and move forward with her life. She is voiced by Eri Kitamura in Japanese and Kira Buckland in English. In the Blue Exorcist musical, she was portrayed by Anna Hachimine. True Cross Order The is the main organization of Exorcists within the series, a global exorcist institution that is controlled by the Vatican. The True Cross Order has roots in Christianity, and was founded by medieval Christian knights. Originally established as a military order, the organization's centuries-long campaign against demons has allowed it to discover and develop new exorcism techniques from all around the globe. As of today, the Order is the largest and most powerful exorcist organization in the world. Given that they have defended mankind from demons for roughly 2000 years, the Order trains exorcists. In addition, the Order takes it upon itself to heal humans who have been harmed by demons, as well as to proactively investigate possible demonic activity. An additional mission of the True Cross Order is to find and destroy human organizations that support demons and demonic activity, such as Demon Eaters or the Illuminati. =Mephisto Pheles= is the Chairman of True Cross Academy's Japanese branch (using the name, , in public). He is portrayed as a man with more money than sense but is very cheap when it comes to spending on others. After Shiro Fujimoto's death, he is ordered to kill Rin but instead accepts Rin's proposal of becoming an Exorcist and enrolled him into True Cross Academy. Mephisto is a powerful exorcist - he is an Honorary Knight (but does not hold a Meister), and claims that he desires to \\"bring peace to both Assiah and Gehenna\\". Despite having served the True Cross for at least two centuries, elements of the Order still consider him suspicious. Their mistrust has its reasons as during the series it is hinted that indeed Mephisto has some secret agenda which involves Rin, working behind the scenes regarding the events around him since he joined the order. Mephisto says Assiah is the best playground for him; he fully enjoys Japanese culture, and proudly admits to Rin that he is an otaku. He owns a large collection of anime and manga-related items, some of which feature characters from Kazue Kato's first manga series, Robo & Usakichi. Just like Amaimon, Mephisto is a son of Satan, making him Rin and Yukio's half-brother, and one of the \\"Eight Demon Kings\\", originally known as Samael, the \\"King of Time\\". This is confirmed by how, numerous times in the series, he can be heard chanting \\"Eins, zwei, drei\\", which is German for \\"One, two, three\\". In Gehenna's hierarchy of Demon Kings he is second only to Lucifer, his older brother and the \\"King of Light.\\" His ability to transform into a small dog or conjure a giant cuckoo clock are only glimpses of his true powers which allow him to control space and time. Mephisto is suggested to know what will happen, likely due to being King of Time, and has made more than one comment about how he is manipulating the other characters behind the scenes. In a fourth wall break, he tells the readers he believes humans have three desires, which are lust (procreation), greed (financies) and knowledge (curiosity). He is voiced by Hiroshi Kamiya in Japanese and Sam Riegel in English, while in VOMIC he is voiced by T≈çru ≈åkawa. In the Blue Exorcist musical, he was portrayed by Y≈´ya Nakahara. His name is derived from Mephistopheles, a demon from the German legend of Faust. =Shiro Fujimoto= is a Catholic priest at the Southern Cross Monastery, a Paladin in the True Cross Order (the title awarded to the strongest exorcist), Shura Kirigakure's mentor, and foster father to Rin and Yukio Okumura. He was qualified as a Knight, Dragoon, Doctor, Aria and Tamer through his cait sith familiar, which he called Kuro. Shiro is a man dedicated to his duties and was considered the strongest exorcist. Stealing the demon- slaying sword Kurikara, Shiro and Mephisto ultimately used the sword to seal the demon heart of the son of Satan and Yuri Egin. Shiro then adopted Yuri's children, Yukio who did not inherit Satan's power, and Rin, full inheritor of Satan's powers. It is revealed that Shiro is actually born a clone from the Asylum, a facility that gathered orphans and trained them to become exorcists, with a branch called Section 13 serves as experimentation lab to create a suitable vessel for Lucifer. In Shiro's case, he was a clone of Azazel. Resenting the place, Shiro escaped and met the orphaned Yuri and for a while they stayed together until the Asylum retrieved him together with Yuri who was able to see demons. Desperate for freedom, Shiro strikes a deal with Mephisto to make him exorcist, though even after reaching the rank of Paladin, he was still bound to the Section 13 albeit having more freedom. During this time, he formed a close relationship with Yuri, and even possibly fell in love with her despite having rejected her earlier love confession. Shiro is thought to be the only man in the world able to sustain possession by Satan himself and thus Satan was constantly after his body. He fights off Satan's attempts at possessing his body through sheer willpower, but after receiving a mental shock from Rin accusing him of \\"playing father\\" and not caring, Satan takes over his body. After Satan summons the Gehenna's Gate to retrieve Rin, Shiro regains control of his body temporarily and commits suicide in order to stop Satan. Due to his death, the already tense relationship between Rin and Yukio become worse as Yukio blames Rin for Shiro's death and resents Rin for that. Because of this, Rin decides to avenge Fujimoto by killing Satan with his own hands; he also considers him to be the coolest person he knows. He is voiced by Keiji Fujiwara in Japanese and Kirk Thornton in English, while in VOMIC he is voiced by Yoshito Yasuhara. In the Blue Exorcist musical, he was portrayed by Yasuhiko Imai. In 2017 anime, Shiro is voiced by Hiroaki Hirata. =Shura Kirigakure= is an Upper First Class Exorcist. She trained under the guidance of Shiro Fujimoto to obtain the title \\"Meister\\" in Knight and can draw a demon sword from a symbol above her chest when she states, \\"Devour the Eight Princesses, slay the Serpent\\". She dresses revealingly, with bikini tops and shorts. Her sword skills allow her to fight on par with upper level demons like Amaimon. Frequently chipper and obnoxious, Shura is carefree about her job, as she drinks alcohol in excess and oversleeps. She appears to harbor a dark past, as she claims Shiro \\"came and rescued\\" her. Its later revealed Shura is cursed by a pact her ancestor made with a snake deity; she will die atrders to investigate the Japanese Branch and eliminate anything she discovered related to Satan. Shura intended to dispose of \\"her master's mess\\", Rin, after verifying that Rin was Satan's son, but Rin convinces her he would become a Paladin and prove Shiro was right to let him live. Shura decides to teach Rin how to control his powers in accordance with Shiro's wishes. Later it is revealed that her true mission is to keep an eye on Mephisto, whose real intentions are still shrouded in mystery. She is voiced by Rina Sat≈ç in Japanese and Wendee Lee in English. =Igor Neugauss= is an Upper First Class Exorcist as well as lecturer in the Academy, who obtained the titles of Tamer, Doctor and Aria. He wears an eyepatch over his left eye, and has Aria incantations and magic circles tattooed on both arms. He had a run-in with Satan when he was younger, which robbed him of his family and the sight in his left eye, which is why he holds immense hatred for Satan and demons that are related to Satan. Yet ironically, he is extremely loyal to Mephisto, willing to listen to his every command, which is why he stopped his attacks on Rin prior to the latter becoming an Exorcist. In the anime, he ends up the suspect for the Masked Man attacks on those allied with Rin; however, the truth is much worse. \\"Someone\\" used a demon to bring his wife, Michelle, back to life, and her mental instability at the horrible memory of the Blue Night caused her to attack anything related to Satan, even the friends of his sons. He is voiced by Ry≈çtar≈ç Okiayu and Patrick Seitz in English. =Arthur Auguste Angel= is the newly appointed Paladin. He was ordered by the Grigori to interrogate Mephisto and capture Rin as evidence. Arthur is a respected Exorcist with dubious ethics, as said by Shura to be like a saint on the outside but really a devil inside. He uses the sentient demon sword Caliburn. When speaking, Caliburn shows extreme affection towards him and talks like a love-struck teenage girl. Arthur has a great dislike of Rin (simply because of his lineage), being annoyed that the son of Satan destroyed the Impure King. Arthur is a terrible liar, and hinted to be somewhat of an idiot (by Shura) since he always lets Lightning do the thinking for him. In the spin-off, Salaryman Exorcist, it is shown that Arthur has an immense distaste for dirty objects getting near him and draws Caliburn to eliminate the dirt. In the anime, Arthur is replaced by Yukio when Ernst takes over the Vatican. He is voiced by Daisuke Ono in Japanese and by David Vincent in English. =Nemu Takara= is a quiet and mysterious character that carries around a sock puppet. He uses ventriloquism to talk and he is usually rude. Although initially posing as an Esquire, Nemu's powers are revealed to be equivalent to that of an upper first class Exorcist. He is hired by Mephisto as a 'moderator' for the cram students. It's suggested Nemu's puppet is sentient and is actually the one controlling his body, since it was telling Nemu to calm down; adding to this is that Nemu's eyes are usually seen closed, suggesting that he is in a trance. He is voiced by Tsubasa Yonaga in Japanese and by Brianne Siddall in English. Other characters =Amaimon= is the \\"King of the Earth\\" and another son of Satan. Among the Eight Demon Kings, he is the seventh in strength. Amaimon has vast control over the land, such as being able to create earthquakes. He is eccentric and hates being laughed at or ignored. Unlike his father and elder brother Mephisto Pheles, Amaimon initially had little interest in Rin, instead wishing to tour Japan upon arrival, but quickly became obsessed with his younger half-brother after fighting him. Amaimon mentions he has a cousin who has an interest in the occult and even goes on to say that he would be happy if he brought him a human eye. After Rin defeats Amaimon in the anime, he turns into a green hamster for the rest of the episodes, running in a hamster wheel located in Mephisto's office. He retains his ability to speak to Mephisto. In the manga, Mephisto Pheles stopped Rin and Amaimon from fighting when Rin went berserk; he is later kept in another dimension, skewered in place by Mephisto until Amaimon's desire to kill Rin cools. Once he promised not to do anything violent for the time being, Amaimon attends True Cross Academy as Mephisto's nephew and is placed in the same class as Shiemi. He has an obsession with sweets, as he is seen with a lollipop in his mouth most of the time. He is voiced by Tetsuya Kakihara in Japanese and Darrel Guilbeau in English. In the Blue Exorcist musical, he was portrayed by Y≈´ki Tamaki. =Saburota Todo= is a former Upper Second Class exorcist, teacher at the Exorcist Cram School, and Director of the Saishinbu, an area of the True Cross Academy containing dangerous artifacts including Right and Left Eyes of the Impure King. He is sly and skillfully manipulates others to achieve his still-unknown goals. After stealing the Left Eye of the Impure King, he officially left the True Cross Order. He can take control of demons and use their abilities. He seems to be interested in Yukio's development due to him being a son of Satan, and even attempted to convince him to kill Rin. He became hotter by gaining Karura's power. He is voiced by Kazuhiro Yamaji and by Junichi Suwabe in his youth in Japanese and Ray Chase in English. =Satan= is the main antagonist and the lord of demons who wishes to take control of the humans' world, Assiah. While father to Mephisto Pheles, Amaimon, and Lucifer, he also fathered Rin and Yukio Okumura through their human mother. When Rin awakes his demonic powers inherited from his father, Satan takes control of Rin's guardian, Shiro Fujimoto, in order to encounter and use his son to destroy Assiah. However, Fujimoto's suicide causes him to lose contact with Rin. Years before the start of the series, Satan was a spirit known as Rinka and has yet to develop an ego. He often played with the child Yuri and kept her company as she grew up until he inadvertently possessed one of the clones created at the Asylum. Using the clone, he went berserk like a child throwing tantrum and would only listen to Yuri. When Shiro defeated him in a game during an attempt to get him to expand his sociality, he began to change, beginning to read books to expand his knowledge of the world and eventually claimed himself to be a god, taking on his current identity as Satan. This belief makes him looking down on other beings and dismiss the value of life. He escaped from Asylum for six months until he finally returned after the clone body he was possessing began to rot. He took over Section 13 to demand new body while delaying his deteriorating vessel through the use of Elixir. This earned him Lucifer's loyalty and allowed Section 13 to continue their experimentation on the Elixir. The Order took this to their advantage to preserve Section 13 under pretext the whole Asylum being taken hostage by Satan. Only until Yuri confronted him and he realized his love for Yuri that Satan decided to abandon Section 13 so he could spend his remaining life with her. Unfortunately, the researchers leaked their plan, allowing the Order to capture the weakened Satan and Yuri. While officially being declared dead, Satan's immobile body was used as lab rat for the order to continue improving Elixir, which eventually led to the Blue Night incident. In the anime series, Satan once again tries to achieve his plans by using Yukio as his vessel, but Yukio is freed by Rin. He really seemed to care about Rin and Yukio's mother; it was their shared dream to make world where demons and humans lived together in harmony. He meets her spirit at the end of the anime, where she comforts him on his failure by explaining their sons are the first step. He is voiced by Keiji Fujiwara in Japanese and Kirk Thornton in English, while in VOMIC he is voiced by Atsushi Imaruoka. =Reiji Shiratori= was the leader of the delinquent gang. He attacks Rin after Astaroth, King of Rot takes over his body. Astaroth was exorcised by Shiro Fujimoto and Reiji hasn't been seen since. Reiji was a delinquent gang leader and likes troubling others. Due to his evilness he was further possessed by Astaroth, the King of Rot. He is very sadistic. In contrast with his delinquent personality, Reiji comes from a rather rich family. Later on, it is revealed that he too attends True Cross Academy as a student. He is voiced by Kentar≈ç It≈ç in Japanese and Derek Stephen Prince in English. =Tsukumo Kamiki= is Izumo's little sister. She is four or so when we are introduced to her and about nine years old when we see her after the whole nine-tailed fox mess. After an incident when her mother got possessed by a nine-tailed fox demon, she and Izumo were taken to an Illuminati headquarters. They were told they were there for their \\"protection\\" and that the Illuminati was \\"taking care of their mother\\". One day Izumo awoke without her sister without beside her as usual. An Illuminati agent named Maria Yoshida said that she had found out they were going to use Tsukumo for experiments, so the night before, Maria had taken Tsukumo to be adopted. She was adopted right away because of her young age. Five years later it is revealed that Maria had not been lying to Izumo, Tsukumo had been adopted by Nemu Takaras' aunt and uncle. Tsukumo was safe from the Illuminati because she had been taken in by people protected by the True Cross Order. Unfortunately, when Izumo approached her sister for the first time in five years, her sister did not remember her. =Yuri Egin= was the mother of Rin and Yukio Okumura. She was an orphan who was taken by the Order of True Cross to the Asylum where she is trained as an exorcist. She eventually became Lower Second Class Exorcist as a Tamer. Despite her talent, she refused to fight in the frontlines because she loved demons and prefer to work at the Demon Farm. Yuri was well-known and popular amongst her peers, but she only has eyes for Shiro whom despite being outwardly violent, she believed has kindness deep inside him. She professed her love for Shiro and got rejected, but this also softened Shiro's heart who gradually began to socialize well with others. Ever since she was a child, she was accompanied by a spirit Rinka, who later eventually became known as Satan. After Rinka possessed one of the clones created by Section 13, Yuri decided to take care of him since he would only listen to her or else he'll throw a tantrum. Even after Rinka changed and took identity as Satan, Yuri still decided to wait for the day until he return and then save him. When Satan did return after his vessel became to deteriorate, Yuri confronted and convinced him to stop his obsession in getting a new body, promising to stay by his side until he dies. She eventually bore him twin children and they decided to leave Section 13, but their escape was leaked, resulting them being captured by the Order. To cover the existence of Section 13, Yuri was blamed for the entire incident and deemed as a witch for being pregnant with Satan. Despite the consequence, Yuri refused to abort her children, insisting she will protect them. In the anime, she was a Lower Second Class Exorcist, and about sixteen years ago, bore Satan's children. Her personality was somewhat like Rin's, rebelling against her father's wishes by living in the forest. Despite being an Exorcist, she regarded demons, such as the Goblins and the Snowmen, as her friends. She believed they were curious about life in Assiah and only acted evil because they resented being ostracised by humans. She first encountered Satan on a mission investigating spontaneous combustion. Unlike her companions, Yuri was able to resist being incinerated by Satan's flames. She took pity on him and allowed him to possess her to experience life in Assiah. Not long after, their children Rin and Yukio were conceived. Her own father ordered her to be burned alive after she refused to abort her unborn children. She was saved by Satan and fled back to the woods and gave birth before passing away. Many have claimed that the twins strongly resemble their mother. She is voiced by Megumi Hayashibara in Japanese and Cherami Leigh in English. =Kuro= is a cat sith and Rin Okumura's familiar, but before he was once the familiar of Shiro Fujimoto until his death at the hands of Satan. He is a black cat with two tails (which is considered to be sacred in ancient Japan) who possesses the abilities of change from a small cat into a nekomata, a giant demon cat with immense strength and power, and the demon telepathy, which allow him to mentally communicate with other demons, including Rin. In ancient times, Kuro used to be the guardian deity of some local silk farmers, until be forgotten by people as the times changed, going berserk, but Fujimoto tamed him and made him his familiar. He soon gained a new role as one of the guardians of the True Cross Academy. After learning of Shiro's death, Kuro lost control and begin attacking the academy, until Rin calm him down, becoming his familiar in the process. He is voiced by Ayahi Takagaki in Japanese and Stephanie Sheh in English. =Lucifer= Anime-only characters =Ernst Frederik Egin= is an anime-only, non-canon character. He is Yuri Egin's father and Rin and Yukio's grandfather. He holds a deep hatred against Satan and demons for ruining his life. In the anime only arc, Ernst gave the order to have his daughter, Yuri Egin, executed when he found out that she was pregnant with the children of Satan, indicating that his hatred is unbound by family love. His hatred only grew after the blue night, when he was possessed by Satan, who was trying to save Yuri. Following Yuri's escape,he orders her and her children to be hunted down and destroyed, and believed that they were all killed. He also is against the Grigori's decision to allow Mephisto to belong in the Order, going along with his dislike for demons. After discovering his grandsons are actually alive and working as exorcists, He recruits Yukio (since he believes that he is purely human, whereas Rin has awakened his demonic abilities) as a part of his plan to wipe out all demons. As such, he hates Rin, and even attempts to kill him to open the Gehenna Gate using his blood. He is killed when a vengeful Satan sucks him through the Gehenna Gate he opened. He is voiced by Toshihiko Miki in Japanese and Dave Mallow in English. =Usamaro= is a young demon Rin meets in the Phantom Train subjugation mission during the events of the movie. He seems to be sealed in a shrine for an unknown reason. He is looked after by Rin during the festival. He is voiced by Rie Kugimiya in Japanese and Cassandra Lee in English. =Qing-Long Liu= is an Upper First Class Exorcist from the Taiwan branch that is featured in the film. Comes to Japan to help True Cross Academy change a new barrier. From an elite family and has high exorcism skills. He is voiced by Hidenobu Kiuchi in Japanese and Todd Haberkorn in English. Reception The characters of Blue Exorcist have been well received by publications for manga and anime with Rin Okumura's receiving most with Danica Davidson from Otaku USA praising his heroic traits despite his demonic nature. Although Carl Kimlinger found that the cast contained several stereotypes found in other series, the delivery from them made the series entertaining first noting the comedy and then fight scenes. In a later review he noted how the secondary characters were given their own episodes to be developed as well other ones where they get closer with Rin. Similar comments were given by Comic Book Bin reviewer Leroy Douresseaux who enjoyed the interaction between the cast, while Chris Beveridge from The Fandom Post noted that while characters' regrouping may feel forced, the revelation of Rin's nature bring multiple reactions to them. The designs by author Kazue Kato were also praised for the way its character is given their distinct traits as well as the changes from Rin when using his demonic powers.

It plays an important role in the ecology of Lake Natron, the main regular breeding site for near-threatened lesser flamingos. Changes to land use in the river's headwaters or in the marshes before the river enters the lake could have a serious impact on this species. Course The Ewaso Ng'iro rises on the Mau Escarpment, where it drains the south part of the Mau Forest. The forest, which plays an important role in regulating and filtering the inflow to the river, is under threat from logging and land clearance for farming. Destruction would increase sediment loads in the river and cause greater seasonal variance in the volume of water. The river flows south through the rift valley to the east of the Nguruman Escarpment. It crosses the border into Tanzania, where it empties into Lake Natron. The river, which runs all year round, is the main inflow to the lake. The river once flowed directly into the lake, but in geologically recent times it has been dammed by a horst beside the Shompole volcano. This has caused the waters to spread out into the steadily expanding Engare Ng'iro swamp, where the river deposits its sediment. The sediment-free river water then seeps into the brine lake. The permanent swamp covers about . South of this a seasonal floodplain of about stretches down to Lake Natron and along its eastern shore. Possible changes Lesser flamingos over Lake Natron The Lake Natron basin has been designated a Wetlands of International Importance under the Ramsar Convention. However, in the past there have been plans to dam the Ewaso Ng'iro for hydroelectric power generation and for irrigation of the marshlands north of the lake, diverting water from other rivers to increase the flow. The plans would also include creating a variable freshwater lagoon with an area of about . If implemented, the impact on the lake's ecology could be drastic. Reduced salinity and pollution with agri-chemicals could wipe out the blue-green algae that provide food for the lesser flamingo. The lake is the main breeding ground for this near-threatened species. As of 2007 the dam project appeared to be on hold.

The game is the prequel to Lost Planet: Extreme Condition and Lost Planet 2 and takes place on the same planet of E.D.N. III. The game takes a more story-driven narrative approach to the campaign similar to the first game. Unlike the previous games in the series, which were developed internally by Capcom, the game was developed externally by Spark Unlimited with Matt Sophos serving as game director, though series creator Kenji Oguro was still attached as franchise creative director. Plot A prequel, Lost Planet 3 takes place long before the first game, following the story of Jim Peyton revealing the events that led to the first game. After nearly being buried alive in a cave an elderly Jim Peyton is found by his granddaughter Diana. Realizing that he does not have long to live he begins to tell her how he came to be on E.D.N. III. Fifty years earlier looking to support his family, Jim joins an expedition to mine the resources of E.D.N III. Funded by the NEVEC corporation, the expedition hopes to tap E.D.N III's \\"Thermal Energy\\", a blood like substance that could solve the Earth Energy problem. Jim meets Dr. Kendric Kovac, operations director Phil Braddock, Doctor Roman, head technician Gale and fellow Rig pilot Laroche. On a job to repair the comms relay, Jim begins to suspect there is a saboteur on the base when he sees someone near the damaged relays. He finds that Doctor Roman has had similar sightings, but dismisses his suspicions and focuses on working to support his family. Some time later Jim stumbles upon an abandoned NEVEC base revealing that the expedition crew were not the first ones to land on E.D.N III as they were told. The last records detail the Akrid attacking the base and killing the inhabitants. Attempting to leave, Jim fights a massive Akrid leaving his rig damaged and himself close to death before he is saved by the woman he saw at the comms relay. He awakens in a settlement a few days later, healed. The woman introduces herself as Mira and her people as \\"The Forgotten\\", survivors of NEVEC's first colonization attempt. Their leader Soichi, Mira's father, does not trust Jim but allows him to leave their enclave after repaying his debt under the agreement that he not reveal their existence. Returning to base he finds it under attack by Akrid, the result of an experiment by Dr. Kovac, who's been studying how to control them. Jim confronts Braddock with his discovery of the first colony. Braddock explains that his father was the colonies leader before it was lost, and that to maintain the expedition's funding from NEVEC he must keep the incident secret. Jim agrees to keep the colony secret and help him investigate what happened, keeping the Forgotten a secret. Several months pass and with the Forgotten's help Jim is able to retrieve information on what happened and give it to Braddock. He is shocked to find that when the colony was attacked his father abandoned it to save Braddock and his mother. Jim tries to tell Braddock about the Forgotten but is cut short when he must defend the base from an Akrid. In the following months Jim grows closer to the Forgotten and the Expedition, planning to bring Braddock and Soichi together so they can resolve their pasts. Before he can NEVEC unexpectedly takes over the Expedition. They begin looking for Dr. Roman, who with Jim's help has been working on triangulating the purest veins of Thermal Energy, however he finds Dr. Roman dead and in a fit of rage kills a NEVEC soldier nearby who presumably murdered her. Now determined to stop NEVEC Jim and the Forgotten prepare to sabotage their mining efforts with Gale's help. While enacting their plan however they are confronted by Laroche who has been sent by NEVEC to stop them. He reveals that he called NEVEC to the base after seeing Jim meet with Mira, and that NEVEC is attacking the Forgotten. Jim defeats Laroche but spares him and makes his way to the Forgotten's settlement. Soichi is killed and Jim forced to surrender when he finds NEVEC has taken his family hostage. Using Dr. Roman's stolen research combined with Dr. Kovacs smarts NEVEC has a plan to save Earth. Braddock helps Jim escape and free his family and the crew, including Laroche despite what he's done, he sacrifices himself to kill Neven's soldiers. Pursuing NEVEC's field commander Isenberg, Jim ruins his plan to take control of the Akrid and use them to wipe out the rebels and so NEVEC are not able to mine the living planet of pure energy and save earth, putting a stop to Isenberg's plan by killing him but nearly dying himself. With NEVEC defeated the expedition crew and the Forgotten become the first snow pirates. Gale and Mira use Soichi's research to create the Harmonizer, a device that uses thermal energy to heal the user. In the present Jim apologizes to his grand daughter for leaving a legacy where she has been forced to fight before passing away. An elderly Laroche finds them and rescues Diana. Diana is saddened by her grandfather's passing but looks forward to the possibility of winning the war and taking the planet back from NEVEC. Gameplay Using the game's mission-based mechanics, players can choose to take on core quests that progress the story, or side- quests to help out fellow colonists on the planet. The game will allow players to openly explore areas in a style similar to role-playing games with the ability to talk to non-player characters, obtain side-quests, upgrade equipment and build their own bipedal rigs using items gathered throughout the campaign. Thermal energy will no longer be tied to the characters' life support, and instead will primarily be used as a form of currency, giving the player more freedom to explore E.D.N. III. Once again, the antagonists of the game are the Akrid, \\"aliens\\" indigenous to the planet of E.D.N. III. Reception Lost Planet 3 received \\"mixed\\" reviews on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions a score of one nine, one eight, one seven, and one nine for a total of 33 out of 40. The Escapist gave the Xbox 360 version three stars out of five and called it \\"a solid third person shooter [that] is marred by some repetitive gameplay elements and a lack of depth with its mechanics and story\\". However, The Digital Fix gave the PS3 version a score of four out of ten and stated: \\"Two positive things to take away from everything is [sic] that it is arguably the best game Spark have ever produced and is not as bad as Aliens: Colonial Marines\\". Digital Spy gave it a similar score of two stars out of five and said it was not \\"a lost cause. There's some genuine emotion to be found in its storyline and a spattering of variety to its combat, but this is marred by unoriginal core gameplay and lackluster level design\\". Lost Planet 3 sold 27,503 PlayStation 3 copies on the first week of being on sale in Japan, the lowest sales debut out of the numbered installments of the series. Reporting on its fiscal year, Capcom described the game's sales as \\"below expectations\\", \\"due in part to intensifying competition in the European and US markets\\". =Awards= In January 2014, Lost Planet 3 writers Richard Gaubert, Orion Walker and Matt Sophos were nominated for Outstanding Achievement in Videogame Writing by the Writers Guild of America along with Assassin‚Äôs Creed IV: Black Flag, Batman: Arkham Origins, God of War: Ascension and The Last of Us (the latter of which was a winner).

The Lebanese system is parliamentary democracy, which implements a special system known as confessionalism. This system is intended to deter sectarian conflict and attempts to fairly represent the demographic distribution of the 18 recognized religious groups in government. High-ranking offices are reserved for members of specific religious groups. The President, for example, has to be a Maronite Christian, the Prime Minister a Sunni Muslim, the Speaker of the Parliament a Shi‚Äôa Muslim, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Deputy Speaker of Parliament Eastern Orthodox Christian. Family life Family life is very important in the Lebanese culture. Family functioning is associated with the values of collectivism in the Lebanese society. One person‚Äôs family functioning is indicative of their individual status and identity.Kazarian, Shahe S. \\"Family Functioning, Cultural Orientation, and Psychological Well- Being Among University Students in Lebanon.\\" The Journal of Social Psychology 145.2 (2005): 141-54. The average household size ranges between 3.9 and 4.9. =Kinship= Patrilineal kin group is another major unit of identity for the Lebanese. The actual extent of identity through kin groups varies. Large clans are typically more traditional and have political and economic ties to its unit. Instead, extended families are generally the boundaries of which these kin groups separate. The Lebanese household serves as the center of these kin groups. There are little variations in kinship patterns in the rural and urban areas of Lebanon. The value of family loyalty is heavily emphasized within these kin groups. One important expectation of family loyalty is nepotism, where family members are expected to find employment for each other, in order for its family unit to function and survive.Gulick, John. \\"Old Values and New Institutions in a Lebanese Arab City.\\" Human Organization 24.1 (1965): 49-52. =Children and parenting= Child-rearing practices are characterized by abundant protection imposed on children by parents.

Gender roles Notwithstanding the persistence of traditional attitudes regarding the role of women, Lebanese women enjoy equal civil rights and attend institutions of higher education in large numbers (for example, women constituted 41 percent of the student body at the American University of Beirut in 1983). Although women in Lebanon have their own organizations, most exist as subordinate branches of the political parties. The illiteracy rate for females in 2007 was 14%, compared to 6.6% among males. The economic activity rate for the age group 15 years and above is 68.9% for males, but only 20.4% for females. The proportion of seats held by women in parliament in 2009 was 3.1%.

He was the first president of Gettysburg College (then Pennsylvania College) 1834‚Äì1850. Biography At the age of 18, he began the study of medicine, but abandoned it for theology, and in 1819 the ministerium of Pennsylvania licensed him to preach. After holding pastorates at Martinsburg, Pennsylvania, and Shepherdstown, Virginia, he was called in 1827 to Philadelphia to take charge of the recently organized English-speaking congregation. In 1833 he was elected professor of biblical and oriental literature in the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettysburg, and the following year he was unanimously elected president of Pennsylvania College, also in Gettysburg. In 1850 he resigned his post as president of the college, in order to devote his time exclusively to duties in the theological seminary, where he continued to labor until his death. He was given the degree of D.D. by the University of Pennsylvania in 1837. Literary works Krauth edited the Evangelical Review from 1850 until 1861, and, besides articles in its pages, published various discourses, including his inaugural address as president of Pennsylvania College (Gettysburg, Pa., 1834), and Discourse on the Life and Character of Henry Clay (1852). He was co-editor of the general synod's hymn-book (1828), and edited the Lutheran Sunday-School Hymn-Book (Philadelphia, 1843). Family One of his sons, Charles Porterfield Krauth, was a noted Lutheran theologian. Another son, John Morris Krauth, joined the 26th Pennsylvania Emergency Militia in the days immediately prior to the Battle of Gettysburg, which fought a brief skirmish before fleeing from their post west of Gettysburg on June 26, 1863.

Usually considered to have been instigated by Marcel Duchamp's Fountain exhibited at the first exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists in 1917, and becoming a movement at the Cabaret Voltaire in February, 1916, in Z√ºrich, the Dadaism as a loose network of artists spread across Europe and other countries, with New York becoming the primary center of Dada in the United States. The very word Dada is notoriously difficult to define and its origins are disputed, particularly amongst the Dadaists themselves. The Dada movement has had continuous reverberations in New York art culture and in the art world generally ever since its inception, and it was a major influence on the New York School and Pop Art. Nevertheless, any attempt to articulate solid links between Dada and these movements must be tenuous at best. Such an attempt must begin philosophically with an acknowledgement of the Dadaists' demand to create a new world and artistically with an examination of the techniques the Dadaists used to do so. Overview Francis Picabia, R√©veil Matin (Alarm Clock), Dada 4-5, Number 5, 15 May 1919 \\"New York Dada\\" refers in general to the actions and principles of a group of loosely affiliated artists involved in the production, display, distribution, and criticism of art, being produced in the years 1913 to 1923 in New York City. The primary artists were Marcel Duchamp, Francis Picabia, Man Ray, Beatrice Wood, Louise Norton, Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, Juliette Roche Gleizes, and Jean Crotti. Because of this groups philosophical orientation (with an anti-nationalistic, anti-war, and anti-bourgeois attitude featuring prominently), techniques of art production (from varieties of Cubism to collage as well as ready-mades), critique of prior forms of art (in particular those forms identified with classical conceptions of mimetic representation, as well as those deemed tainted by affiliation with aristocratic or bourgeois values and or aristocratic or bourgeois patronage), self-pronounced allegiances (with each other as well as other avant-garde artists), and relation to other similar groups in Europe, they are referred to as Dada. \\"New York Dada\\" developed independently of Zurich Dada. According to Hans Richter, \\"We in Zurich remained unaware until 1917 or 1918 of a development which was taking place, quite independently, in New York.\\" The creations of Duchamp, Picabia, Man Ray, and others between the Armory Show in 1913 and 1917 eluded the term Dada at the time, and \\"New York Dada\\" came to be seen as a post facto invention of Duchamp. At the outset of the 1920s the term Dada flourished in Europe with the help of Duchamp and Picabia, who had both returned from New York. Notwithstanding, Dadaists such as Tzara and Richter claimed European precedence. Art historian David Hopkins notes: > Ironically, though, Duchamp's late activities in New York, along with the > machinations of Picabia, re-cast Dada's history. Dada's European > chroniclers‚Äîprimarily Richter, Tzara, and Huelsenbeck‚Äîwould eventually > become preoccupied with establishing the pre-eminence of Zurich and Berlin > at the foundations of Dada, but it proved to be Duchamp who was most > strategically brilliant in manipulating the genealogy of this avant-garde > formation, deftly turning New York Dada from a late-comer into an > originating force.Hopkins, David, A Companion to Dada and Surrealism, Volume > 10 of Blackwell Companions to Art History, John Wiley & Sons, May 2, 2016, > p. 83, Marcel Duchamp, Fountain, 1917; photograph by Alfred Stieglitz Beginning with a showing of the work of Picabia at gallery 291 (if not the armory show in 1913 where a few of the works of Picabia and Duchamp set the stage for future endeavors), owned and operated by renowned and historically influential photographer Alfred Stieglitz, this group began to take shape Coupled with Stieglitz‚Äôs gallery, the patronage, enthusiasm, and intellectual support of the Arsenbergs provided the economic conditions of possibility for the Dada artists to exist in New York at that time. The arche-typical city of modernity New York was an attractive destination for Duchamp as well as others because of the relative calm it offered in comparison to war plagued Europe (Duchamp once remarked, \\"I do not go to New York, I escape Paris.\\") as well as its incredible energy. Speaking of a series of New York inspired paintings, Picabia once said that \\"they express the spirit of New York as I feel it, the crowded streets... their surging, their unrest, their commercialism, their atmospheric charm... You of New York should be quick to understand me and my fellow painters [because] your New York is the cubist, futurist city.\\" People =Alfred Stieglitz= Francis Picabia, c.1921-22, Optophone I, 72 x 60 cm. Reproduced in Galeries Dalmau, Picabia, exhibition catalogue, Barcelona, November 18 - December 8, 1922 According to Naumann, Alfred Stieglitz was unquestionably \\"the individual most responsible for the introduction of modern art to America.\\" An active artist, primarily a photographer, as well as activist in the service of modern art, Stieglitz provided an avenue for the thought and work of the proto-Dada artists as well as the Dada artists with his journal and gallery, both named 291. Stieglitz first made contact with the (soon to be) Dadaists at the notorious Armory show of 1913 where Picabia and Duchamp exhibited paintings that caused an uproar in the New York art scene. Duchamp's Nude Descending a Staircase and Picabia's Dances at the Spring featured prominently at the show and caught the eye of Stieglitz, they proved to be just a taste of what was to come. According to Richter, \\"Stieglitz was a man of lively perception, intensely interested in everything that was new and revolutionary,\\" undoubtedly this demeanor and demand to seek new forms of artistic expression made him a perfect match for the European's coming ashore. =The Arensbergs= Walter Conrad Arensberg and his wife Louise were eccentric collectors of modern art and some of the earliest backers of the Dada artists. Without their support it is unlikely that any of the European Dadaists would have been able to live comfortably in New York and produce their art. They frequently hosted parties, exhibitions, and every other conceivable form of gathering at their large and very minimalist apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Beginning with the Armory show of 1913 Walter was \\"hit between wind and water.\\" With an apartment filled with art pieces that now adorn the walls of major museums (particularly the Philadelphia Museum of Art) the Arensbergs built a hive for the intellectual debates and creative juices of the Dadaists; \\"Over the course of five years ‚Äì from 1915 through 1921 ‚Äì they created a literary and artistic salon that could be ranked in importance with the circle that had formed around Gertrude Stein and her brothers in Paris a few years earlier.\\" Francis Picabia, (Left) Le saint des saints c'est de moi qu'il s'agit dans ce portrait, 1 July 1915; (center) Portrait d'une jeune fille americaine dans l'√©tat de nudit√©, 5 July 1915: (right) J'ai vu et c'est de toi qu'il s'agit, De Zayas! De Zayas! Je suis venu sur les rivages du Pont-Euxin, New York, 1915 =Francis Picabia= Francis Picabia was arguably the first of the \\"New York Dadaists.\\" According to Hans Richter, Picabia was driven by \\"an absolute lack of respect for all values, a freedom from all social and moral constraints, a compulsive urge to destroy everything that had hitherto been given the name of art.\\" As with Duchamp, Picabia was escaping the first World War, but he was also attempting to find an avenue for his artistic philosophy that utilized the achievements of early modern art in France while simultaneously distancing himself from them. For Picabia, New York was liberating in this regard. During his time in New York Picabia participated in riotous orgies of sex and drugs, while attempting to iron out his (anti-)artistic style.Jones, Amelia. 2004. Irrational modernism: a neurasthenic history of New York Dada. Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press. While in New York, \\"he gave up the Cubist style completely and began to produce the images of satiric, machine like contrivances that are his chief contribution to Dadaism.\\"Francis Picabia 1879‚Äì1953, dadart =Marcel Duchamp= Marcel Duchamp was undoubtedly one of the most influential artists of the 20th century. Beginning with his \\"Nude Descending a Staircase\\" which was exhibited at the famous Armory show of 1913, his work became well known and controversial across the New York, as well as American in general, art scene. His personality was equally intoxicating as his art; according to Richter, \\"Duchamp's attitude is that life is a melancholy joke, an indecipherable non-sense, not worth the trouble of investigating. To his superior intelligence the total absurdity of life, the contingent nature of a world denuded of all values, are logical consequences of Descartes' Cogito ergo sum.\\" Most famous amongst the works created by Duchamp in the New York period were his ready-mades, particularly the piece entitled Fountain. During his time in New York he maintained very close connections with both Stieglitz and the Arensbergs and was able to work on his mammoth project entitled \\"Large Glass\\". =Man Ray= Man Ray, 1920, The Coat-Stand (Porte manteau), reproduced in New York dada (magazine), Marcel Duchamp and Man Ray, April, 1921New York dada (magazine), Marcel Duchamp and Man Ray, April, 1921, Biblioth√®que Kandinsky, Centre Pompidou The most prominent of all the American Dadaists, Man Ray was a highly capable and innovative artist in a number of different mediums. Born in Philadelphia, he is the most prominent native artist amongst the New York Dadaists. Man Ray's style can be said to be something of a merger of mediums; his paintings, sculptures, photographs, and various constructions appear to be intertwined manifestations of all of these mediums in one. One of the ways that he managed to achieve this effect was with a purposefully careless looking way that he constructed his art.Belz, Carl. 1964. \\"Man Ray and New York Dada\\". Art Journal. 23 (3): 207‚Äì213. Politics Discussing the politics of Dada is often as contentious as the very politics under discussion. One of the major debates revolves around the question of art/anti-art(which inevitably leads to debates around the essence of \\"art\\" itself). It is fair to say that the Dadaists, and again it is important to reiterate that the Dadaists were only aligned in their rejection of alignment. \\"If 'Dada' had any attraction for them, it was taken as a call for freeing themselves of any movement, and not as a label for yet another movement.\\".Kuenzli, Rudolf E. 1986. New York Dada. New York: Willis Locker & Owens. p. 5. They were \\"anti-art,\\" if we take art to be a historically identifiable sociological category of human creative activity. In other words, they were against the bourgeois epoch of \\"art,\\" as well as those epochs that failed to achieve the frenzied critical representation of society that the Dadaists fed off of and built themselves. Therefore, it is no contradiction to say (or it is a productive contradiction in a dialectical sense) that New York Dada was Anti-Art-Art; their art was an anti-\\"art\\" (that is, the art they attempted to overcome). It is evident from the question of art as it appeared to the Dadaists and as their manifesto's described, that art is inherently a political concept, that the creation of art must be a critical practice. This is why the ready-mades were so baffling, they manage to contain the entire critical contradictory thrust of Dada in one fell prefabricated swoop.

Eriksson played for K√§rra KIF as a youngster, then moved to the Netherlands as a 16-year-old to join Eredivisie club Heerenveen. Named player of the season in the 2009‚Äì10 Eredivisie under-19 league, his career was put on hold when he suffered a broken neck in a car crash. After a lengthy rehabilitation, he returned to Heerenveen's reserves, and spent time on loan at BK H√§cken, with whom he played in the 2011 Allsvenskan. Released by Heerenveen, he had trials with Swedish clubs before returning to K√§rra KIF in March 2012. He represented his country at under-17 and under-19 level. Career Eriksson was born in Gothenburg, and began his football career with local seventh-tier club K√§rra KIF. The 15-year-old Eriksson attracted attention from bigger clubs in the locality, and trained with GAIS, before choosing to join the youth system of Eredivisie club Heerenveen. At 16, he moved to the Netherlands, initially on loan for a year, before the move was made permanent in 2008. He developed through that club's youth system, and, with his initial contract due to expire in the summer of 2010, signed a new two-year contract with the option of a further year. Eriksson had chosen Heerenveen because of the club's approach to personalised training for development players, and thought of the club as a \\"warm family\\", expressing his particular appreciation of how working with coach Jeffrey Talan had improved his strength and stamina. In 2009‚Äì10, he made his first appearances, and scored his first goal, for the club's reserve team, and finished the season as best player in the Eredivisie under-19 league, an honour determined by marks awarded by coaches to the best three opponents in each match. The award was due to be presented before the Johan Cruijff-schaal match in July, but Eriksson was unable to attend. In June, he was driving his girlfriend and a friend when his car was struck by another vehicle, left the road and overturned. His neck was broken, and doctors warned him that he might not walk again, let alone play football. After three months in a neck brace, and a total of nine months' rehabilitation, Eriksson returned to Heerenveen's reserve team. Eriksson returned to Sweden in September 2011, on loan to BK H√§cken, who had been interested in signing him before he went to Heerenveen. In his first game for the reserve side, he missed two chances but was fouled for a penalty, and made his Allsvenskan debut on 23 September as a second-half substitute in a 2‚Äì2 draw with local rivals IFK G√∂teborg. He was an unused substitute for the next game, but played in the reserves for the remainder of the season, and was then released back to Heerenveen. Heerenveen cancelled his contract in January 2012. After trials with Swedish clubs including √ñrgryte IS, and still suffering lower back and groin pain which doctors have been unable to relieve, Eriksson returned to K√§rra KIF in Division 4. He contributed 30 goals over the 22-game season to K√§rra KIF finishing five points clear at the top of the division. On 10 December 2012 the forward, left his club K√§rra KIF of the Swedish Football Division 3 and joined to √Öland Islands based IFK Mariehamn. He played only four League Cup matches and one Suomen Cup match for Mariehamn, before returned to Sweden in April 2013. He is since the release with out an club, but keeps fit with Div 2 Norra G√∂taland club Nordv√§rmland FF. International career Eriksson's first involvement with Sweden's representative teams came when he was called up for a national training camp as a 15-year-old. He went on to play for his country at under-17 and under-19 level.

Robin Boyd was known not only as an architect but also an architectural writer, educator and commentator. Born in 1919, as a member of the Boyd family, he came from a creative family background of sculptors, painters and architects. He and his wife Patricia occupied the South Yarra home with their two daughters.  Historical and cultural significance  Boyd House II is acknowledged as one of Robin Boyd's most prestigious houses.Boyd Foundation : Melbourne, Australia. Retrieved 31 March 2012 Boyd wanted to create a \\"private indoor- outdoor environment despite the narrowness of the allotment and the congested surroundings of the inner suburb.\\" Geoffrey Serle, 1995, 'Robin Boyd: A Life' (Melbourne University Press, (pbk.) p. 189. \\"It is significant as a material expression of Boyd's architectural ideas and writings, which were known internationally at the time.\\"http://www.architecture.com.au/emailnews/national/Heritage/VIC- RobinBoyd2.pdf It also stood out as architecture based on a strong structural- functional design, therefore the structure and function of the home in relation to society. Like Walsh Street, the allotment was on an incline. Originally, the allotment was part of a much larger plot of land and the Walsh Street house sits today on what was once a small side garden. The plan of the house was designed so that most views orient inwards, to the internal courtyard. Due to this introverted plan, views from the street into the house are limited. A large Monterey Pine Tree (Pinus radiata) is located at the front of the house and Boyd designed around the large tree in order to preserve it.  Influences  House II was the second Boyd home and the design was inspired by overseas architectural styles. Boyd was fond of International architecture, in particular the functionalist manner.vhd.heritage.vic.gov.au/reports/report_place/13584 When living in his first family home situated in Camberwell, he considered open plan living, and the idea of allocated areas for the adults and children in the one home. Boyd was also influenced by the \\"structural optimism of the Spanish engineer, Eduardo Torroja\\".Goad, Philip. \\"On the influence of Robin Boyd\\". Monument Magazine 99: pg 22 This optimism was matched by an ambitious proposition by Robin Boyd that considered how one could conceive the idea of dwelling in the Boyd house.Stuckey, Helen 1992, 'Transition no. 38 special issue : Robin Boyd', Dept. Architecture R.M.I.T Functionalism design strongly influenced the appearance of the house at Walsh Street. Boyd deeply considered the choice of material, structure and details. Furthermore, prior to the construction of the house he wrote \\"he [the architect] will interpret his own design in every furnishing and fitting, in the position of every ashtray, in where he leaves the evening paper, in how he sleeps in where and how he and his family eat.\\" Geoffrey Serle, 1995, Robin Boyd: A Life (Melbourne University Press, (pbk.) p. 189. Boyd's willingness to move between different tectonic vocabularies of structure and enclosure differed him from his colleagues where a single idea dominated the design and the house was transformed.Stuckey, Helen 1992, 'Transition no. 38 special issue : Robin Boyd', Dept. Architecture R.M.I.T' In this case it was an innovative idea of a draped roof slung over cables sheltering a house split into zones by an internal courtyard.  Awards  Before the Walsh Street Home became the chosen location for the Robin Boyd Foundation, it was an icon for Australian architecture of the Twentieth Century. It was also recognised internationally and is found in such journals as Japan Interior Design in 1962, The Architectural Review, London in 1960 and 1963 and J M Richard's New Buildings in the Commonwealth, London 1961.http://www.onmydoorstep.com.au/heritage-listing/13584/robin-boyd-house-ii In July 2006, Boyd's Walsh Street House won the RAIA (Royal Australian Institute of Architects) 25 Year Award in Victoria. Later, in October 2006 it won the National 25 Year Award. It is also listed in the Victorian Heritage Register.  Description  In 1947, Robin Boyd wrote \\"In his [the architects] own home all his philosophy of building must surely blossom‚Ä¶\\" Consequently, he tailored his Walsh Street home to suit the needs of himself and his family. The house is physically divided into zones, one for the adults and one for the children. The adults wing is located at the front of the home and the children's is at the back, where there is also vehicular access. In elevation, the brick fa√ßade is made up of two storeys with a strip of windows located high above the front door to prevent anyone seeing into the home, so the house cannot be understood from the street. A flight of splayed stairs from ground level leads to the first floor containing the formal living area, master bedroom, Boyd's study and bathroom. Stairs down to ground floor are situated inside the master bedroom, where furniture has been positioned to take on the role of the balustrading. On the ground floor is the less formal family, dining and kitchen space ‚Äì as well as access to the courtyard. Located across from the courtyard are the children's quarters. The internal courtyard has surrounding glazed walls, which protect it from wind and rain but not light ‚Äì they also allow for a visual connection between the separate buildings. Corridors along the sides of the courtyard provide access for the children to their quarters which contain three bedrooms (one with a study) and a bathroom. There is a lane situated behind the children's quarters, used as a carport. A sloping roof starting from the top of the double storey block, drapes down to the single storey children's block. The roof is held up by single cables tied to steel framing and placed at equal distances by timber members. The creation of the roof involved built-up felt layered on timber decking and an aperture over the internal courtyard was constructed for direct sunlight into the courtyard. Cavity brick construction created the side walls of the property, which were painted in natural earth-like tones. On the interior, the brick walls were clad with jarrah lined timber and the joinery has been made from limed-mountain ash. Since completion of the house, during the 1970s to 1980s, the bathroom in the children's quarters underwent a renovation by architect, Guilford Bell.

They use digital illusion techniques within the mediums of projection mapping, theatre, fine art and moving image.  Early Careers and Personal Lives The duo met in 2004 during a student exchange in Arnhem and married in 2005 in England. Davy McGuire graduated from Dartington College of Arts in 2005 with a degree in Devised Theatre, whereas Kristin McGuire studied Contemporary and Classical Dance at Frankfurt University of Music and Performing Arts. Whilst continuously collaborating on joint art projects Kristin worked as a dancer with a variety of international dance and theatre companies including Cirque du Soleil until the duo set up their joint studio in Bristol. In 2017 Kristin graduated from Glasgow School of Art as a Master of Research in Creative Practices. The duo is now resident in Kingston upon Hull where they create work under their company name Studio McGuire. They are represented by [Muriel Gupein Gallery] in New York, Woolff Gallery in London and the Projection Mapping Association of Japan in Tokyo and their works have been shown in more than 120 venues across 19 countries.  Theatrical Projects  = The Icebook = During a 4-month residency at the K√ºnstlerdorf Sch√∂ppingen Davy and Kristin created the Icebook, the world's first projection mapped pop up book in which a story is back projected onto the pages of the book. After putting a trailer of the work online, it went viral and launched the pair as an artist duo who had invented a new artistic medium by fusing projection mapping, paper craft, book art, theatre, performance and animation. The Icebook has been featured internationally on TV (Canal+ in France, Deutsche Welle in Germany and on NHK in Japan), as well as being published in Digital Arts, Contagious Magazine and Elle Girl Korea and several thousand international websites and blogs. Since 2011 the Icebook has toured to at least 60 art festivals, theatre festivals, digital art festivals, cinemas and film festivals, conferences and art galleries around Europe, America and Asia. =The Paper Architect= In 2013 Davy and Kristin received the Oxford Samuel Becket Theatre Award for their presentation of two projected paper dioramas, The Hunter and Psycho - Homage to Hitchcock. The production grant was awarded to create The Paper Architect, a theatre show blending paper craft, animation and live action, co-produced by the Barbican Centre London with CREATE in association with the Tobacco Factory in Bristol. The Paper Architect was invited to Perth International Arts Festival in 2015 where it won the Helpmann Award for Best Visual Theatre Production. =Howl's Moving Castle= For Christmas 2011, Davy and Kristin McGuire designed and directed a stage adaptation of Howl's Moving Castle at the Southwark Playhouse, who also commissioned the project. The production involved actors interacting with live video projections onto a set that replicated a paper pop-up castle. Howl's Moving Castle was adapted for the stage by Mike Sizemore and featured an original score by Fyfe Dangerfield. The cast included Stephen Fry as narrator Daniel Ings as Howl, Susan Sheridan as old Sophie, James Wilkes as Calcifer and Kristin played the part of young Sophie and the Witch of the Waste. Prior to its premiere Howl's Moving Castle received considerable media attention featuring on TV BBC News London, The Late Show with Joanne Good on BBC Radio London, national press and BBC online. After initial challenges due to technical difficulties Howl's Moving Castle sold out during the last weeks of a 6-week run. The production was Time Out's Critic's Choice in December and received four-star reviews from Metro and The Public Reviews. Reviews praised the imaginative staging, the groundbreaking and ambitious technical ability of the projections, and the visuals. Despite some mixed reviews the show was received as a production that successfully married film and theatre: \\"Is it a play, is it a film, is it an installation? No - it's super-theatre!\\" The show inspired Southwark Playhouse‚Äôs 2016 production of another story associated with Studio Ghibli, Kiki's Delivery Service. = Silent Movie = In 2007 Stroud Valleys Arts Space gave Davy and Kristin permission to create performance work for their annual Site Festival in Stroud. Davy and Kristin thus created and performed Silent Movie, a multimedia performance that mixes projections and live acting. The plot, which recounts a love story between a couple, is evocative of the silent movie genre from the beginning of the 20th century. The performance is viewed by an audience of 15 people through peep holes made in the front wall of a huge wooden box or a shopping window. In 2008 Silent Movie was shown at the Macau Arts Festival in China.  Commercial Commissions  =L'Alchimie de Courvoisier= In 2012 Congnac company Courvoisier commissioned the McGuires to create a bespoke theatrical installation showcasing the brand‚Äôs craftsmanship and the story of its history through a projected paper theatre. The installation which was displayed in Harrods of London in December 2012 received positive media attention. =A Journey to Wonderland= In 2013, ELLE Magazine China commissioned Davy and Kristin to design and direct a short film featuring Chinese actress Zhou Xun wearing Chanel outfits and jewelry. The film was created as a digital accompaniment of a special 25th anniversary editorial for ELLE China‚Äòs iPad edition. =Floating City= For Christmas 2013, the McGuires joined a team of artists headed by Joanie Lemercier commissioned by Barneys to decorate the shop windows of their Madison Avenue store in New York. Floating City was a large scale animated paper structure suspended inside one of the windows. The suspended paper model repeatedly transformed through projection mapping displaying a short looping New York time lapse. =Mikimoto= The Mcguires created a Christmas window display in 2016 for luxury pearl manufacturers Mikimoto's flagship store in Ghinza Road Tokyo. The installation combined paper architecture with shadow play and digital projection.  Public Commissions  = A Study of Eating Habits = In 2005 Davy and Kristin created their multimedia installation A Study of Eating Habits using early techniques of video projection mapping which has since become a signature of most of their works. For A Study of Eating Habits, the couple filmed themselves in their domestic environment over a period of a week and projected the sped up footage back onto the doors, tables and windows which they transferred from their house to a black box gallery space. A Study of Eating Habits was shown at the 2006 European Media Arts Festival in Germany, the 2006 BBC Big Screen Liverpool and the 2008 Macau Arts Festival in China. = Peepboardpleasure = In 2010, Davy and Kristin created a piece based on the illustrations of a traditional seaside peep-through board being replaced by moving video projections. Passers by are needed to poke their head through the holes in the board, thus turning them into fictional moving characters. Peepboardpleasure has been shown in Bristol, as part of the Gr√ºne Meile Festival in Germany, at Burdall's Yard in Bath and the Arts by the Sea Festival 2012 in Bournemouth. The artists were awarded a second stipend from the K√ºnstlerdorf Sch√∂ppingen for this work for which they created the interactive video installation Peepboardpleasure - A Peep Board with a Twist. =Psycho - Homage to Hitchcock= Psycho - Homage to Hitchcock is a projection mapped paper diorama created in 2012 depicting a scene from Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho movie. The installation consists of a TV screen and a paper replica of the Bates' house depicting a murder scene in a shower.https://vimeo.com/89172533#at=4 The documentation trailer of the installation received a staff pick on Vimeo. =The Hunter= As part of the Oxford Samuel Beckett Theatre Trust Award short listing process Davy and Kristin created The Hunter, a projection mapped paper diorama which subsequently won the couple the award. The Hunter has since been exhibited at the 12th Quenington Sculpture Show, the Doddington Sculpture Show, as part of the McGuire's retrospective in Shoreditch Town Hall in London, the World of Projection Mapping Festival in Kagawa/Japan and A Lamb in Wolf's Clothing in Bermondsey, London. =Ophelia's Ghost= Ophelia‚Äòs Ghost is a life sized holographic projection of Hamlet's Ophelia into a water filled basin creating the illusion of a ghostly presence underwater; it was commissioned by Altered Festival's 2015 Contemporary Art in Ancient Churches programme and has been shown as part of Compton Verney Art Gallery's exhibition Shakespeare in Art. =Starkers= In October 2015 they produced an installation called Starkers for the Museums at Night commission at Williamson Art Gallery and Museum in Birkenhead. The piece used projection mapping to make an animate a 200 year old statue called Pauline talk to the audience depicting its experience of body image and mortality. =Micropolis= They were commissioned by Hull UK City of Culture to create an installation as part of The Land of Green Ginger project. Micropolis was a 10 x 10 x 5 metre cardboard sculpture of a miniature city which contained digital projections of the cities miniature inhabitants Collections =Jam Jar Fairy Series= In 2013 the Royal Shakespeare Company commissioned Davy and Kristin to create Sprite Symphony, an art installation using pico projectors to create a display of holographic fairies projected into jam jars. The fairies knock and tap on their jars and thereby create a polyphonic musical composition. Sprite Symphony was exhibited in the RSC theatre foyer in Stratford upon Avon throughout winter 2013,http://www.rsc.org.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/in-stitches/sprite- symphony.aspx at the Enchanted Parks in Newcastle/Gateshead in December 2013, as part of the McGuire's retrospective in Shoreditch Town Hall, at Queens Hall Arts Centre and as part of A Lamb in Wolf's Clothing in Bermondsey, London in 2014. The installation was later developed into individual units in order to accommodate the demandhttps://www.societeperrier.com/blog/10-eccentric-works- of-art-youll-want-to-own-from-london-art-fair/the-fairies-series-by-davy-and- kristin-mcguire-3/http://www.murielguepingallery.com/artists/davy-and-kristin- mcguirehttp://www.lostateminor.com/2014/04/19/sprite-symphony-fairies-trapped- inside-jam-jars/http://www.longandryle.com/artists/davy-and-kristin-mcguire for purchasing individual fairy holograms, thus creating the Jam Jar Fairy Series.https://vimeo.com/90328968 = Pinboard= In 2008 the pair created their first music video, The Girl with two Tone Hair which they later turned into a video installation entitled Pinboard. Pinboard was first exhibited at the Stroud Site Festival in 2010. In 2011 the Quenington Sculpture Trust awarded Davy and Kristin a bursary to include Pinboard in the trust's biennial showcase. Pinboard was part of Barn Gallery's Artspace, a showcase of their work at Burdall's Yard in Bath in 2012, their retrospective The Hunter at Shoreditch Town Hall in Londonhttps://bestoflondonlife.wordpress.com/2014/03/07/davy-kristin-mcguire- the-hunter-and-other-works-shoreditch-town-hall/ and MEDI-ARTz Zushi Festival in Japan in 2014. = The Dark Dolls House = In 2018 The McGuires created a body of work for a solo exhibition at Woolff Gallery in London. Inspired by Film Noir, the pieces are black, wall hanging, wooden dolls houses that are digitally animated with moving images of various Film Noir Characters. Music videos American alternative rock band Thursday commissioned Davy and Kristin to direct and produce Magnets Caught in a Metal Heart, a music video for their album No Devoluci√≥n which Kerrang mentioned as \\"this stunning, artistic video for this killer new song\\". Through London based production house [Partizan] Davy and Kristin got to direct a music video for BRIT Award nominated Guillemots. Guillemot's lead singer Fyfe Dangerfield has since composed an original score for their stage adaptation of Howl's Moving Castle. The 2014 video Yanlƒ±≈ü Se√ßim (English translationWrong Choice) follows singer Atakan Ilgazdaƒü through film sets made out of paper.  Short Films  =Parting= French TV channel Canal+ commissioned 11 film makers to create a short film of 1:11 min length to commemorate 9/11.  Live Art  = Shooting the Messenger = Their first live art piece, entitled Shooting the Messenger was made in 2010 and took them on a hitchhiking tour around Great Britain in which they explored Marshal McLuhan's theories on the global village. Davy gave a talk about his experiences during this adventure at ACC Galerie, Weimar on 21 May 2010.

It is also a duty of the trainer to do mental and physical exercises to keep the animal healthy and happy. Methodology The trainers train these animals by using a positive reinforcement method called operant conditioning. Trainers use two types of reinforcers to train an animal to do a desired behavior. A primary reinforcer is an unlearned or unconditioned reward such as food. A secondary reinforcer is a learned or conditioned reward that acquires reinforcing value through its association with a primary reinforcer. Examples of a secondary reinforcer for the animal could be receiving rubs from a trainer or playing with an enrichment device like a basketball. Trainers need to make sure they reinforce the animal directly after they have successfully done the behavior. When the reinforcer is not given immediately, then the animal will not know that they did the correct behavior. In order to achieve this, the trainer needs to create a bridging stimulus which is a signal that tells the animal that they have done the correct behavior at the moment they respond to the stimulus. This signal from the trainer could be a whistle sound, a click from a training clicker, or even a point of a finger toward the animal. The bridging stimulus acts as a bridge between the moment of the desired behavior and the moment the animal receives the reward. This helps the animal to receive immediate feedback which leads to faster learning and the maintaining of focus when a trainer works with an animal across physical space or an interval of time that causes immediate reinforcement to be impossible. When training a new behavior, it is important to teach in small steps. By training in small steps, you can train an animal to do complex behaviors. This step-by-step learning experience is called shaping. Trainers create different signals for the animals for different behaviors. This helps let the animal know the correct behavior to perform. If an animal does not respond to a signal or responds with an undesired behavior, then the trainer normally will remain motionless and wait three seconds before trying the signal again. This three second pause is referred to as the Least Reinforcing Stimulus, or LRS. It is like a short \\"time-out\\" for the animals. The trainers try not to force a situation and never punish an animal for not doing a behavior correctly. History Of Applied animal training employs many of the behavioral training techniques described by B.F. Skinner developed an experimental analysis of behavior through the use of rats and pigeons in operant chambers. During Skinner‚Äôs pigeon project, he and some graduate students including Marian and Keller Breland, trained pigeons to use a screen and steer a missile to a target. However, this project was never operational. After this project, the Breland‚Äôs and Skinner were interested in potential applications of behavioral technology and operant principles. In 1944, the Breland‚Äôs opened a business called Animal Behavior Enterprises (ABE) on a farm they purchased. They used operant conditioning techniques to train a variety of animals for commercials, advertisements, and entertainment purposes. In 1950, the Breland‚Äôs opened a tourist attraction in Hot Springs, Arkansas called the I. Q. Zoo in Arkansas. The ‚ÄúZoo‚Äù featured exhibits where trained animals would demonstrate many different behaviors from dropping small basketballs into a hoop or hitting a small baseball bat on a miniature field to hit a home run and much more. In 1951, the Breland‚Äôs wrote an article called ‚ÄúA Field of Applied Animal Psychology‚Äù where they proposed that modern behavioral science and professional animal training are brought together through applied animal psychology. In the late 1950‚Äôs into the early 1960‚Äôs, the Breland‚Äôs promoted and patented Master Mind which was a dog training program and clicker training, in an early version, was created. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Breland‚Äôs and ABE adapted operant methods in order to use with marine mammals and began a training program at Marine Studios. The training program included training and developing new behaviors, providing written training manuals, instructing staff in operant methods, and designing props. When working with a dolphin named Splash, the Breland‚Äôs were able to precisely shape and control behavior through using the bridging stimulus. In 1955, the Breland‚Äôs wrote the first operant training manual for dolphins. It included general principles such as stimulus, bridging, shaping, differentiation, extinction, props, and schedules of reinforcement. It also included individual act instructions such as descriptions act goals, target behaviors, signaling instructions, specific training directions, and educational as well as publicity considerations. ABE started the use of training logs to systematize and standardize training and to track the animal‚Äôs progress. In addition, the Breland‚Äôs wrote the first manuals on training whales and dolphins. They scripted and created shows and taught others how to train using operant technology. Other marine parks that use operant training can be traced back to the ABE and the spread of behavioral technology helped the marine animal training industry to grow rapidly. The world‚Äôs first oceanarium called Marine Studios was located in St. Augustine, Florida and opened on June 23, 1938. This park was originally designed as an underwater movie studio, educational facility, and marine research center, but it became a popular tourist attraction. Park visitors could watch marine animals from an observation deck or through the clear walls of the saltwater pools. Atlantic bottlenose dolphins were featured in the first major dolphin attraction called the Top Deck Show. Personnel used a form of shaping by requiring varying and increasingly higher jumps. Personnel would hold fish over the water and the dolphins would leap into the air and take fish out of their hands or their mouth. Marine Studios hired a former sea lion trainer from the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus named Adolf Frohn to train the dolphins to, on command, play with innertubes. Frohn had no previous experience working with dolphins. He worked with a two-year-old-male dolphin named Flippy beginning in September 1949. Frohn first worked with Flippy to get him to remain in his presence and accept fish from him. The trainer did so by rowing a small boat around the lagoon to stay near Flippy. Flippy learned six tricks which included honk a bulb horn, ring a bell, raise a flag, retrieve and catch a ball, pull a surfboard ridden by a woman or dog, and jump through a hoop. Marine Studios announced the world‚Äôs first trained dolphin to the public in February of 1951. Frohn kept his training methods secretive by not keeping training records, not writing method instructions, and not allowing assistants to participate in training due to circus training tradition of passing down the craft through apprenticeship. He used positive reinforcement and believed in the importance of a trusting, patient, and affectionate relationship between a trainer and animal. The rising popularity of marine mammal attractions led to the creation of additional parks such as Sea Life Park Hawaii and SeaWorld. Sea Life Park was opened in 1963 and founded by Pryor and her first husband. Pryor used Ronald Turner‚Äôs operant training manual for dolphins and was able to train dolphins and teach training staff about operant conditioning. These methods were applied to training spinner, kiko, and pacific bottlenose dolphins. Pryor‚Äôs writings about her experiences played a major role in the spread of the use of operant psychology in animal training. SeaWorld was founded by George Millay, Ken Norris, and other investors. In 1964, Millay hired Kent Burgess to be SeaWorld‚Äôs Director of Animal Training who was from ABE. Burgess used his experience from Marineland of the Pacific and Marine Studios to apply behavioral training in a structured system that included using behavioral record keeping, manuals, and courses that train in behavioral psychology. Burgess used operant psychology to train a Killer whale named Shamu. After two months of training, Shamu performed in shows for the public on a regular basis. This show included behaviors like opening her mouth to have her teeth brushed and examined, showing her fluke reflexes, having her heart checked, kissing her doctor on the cheek, and jumping to a target 15 feet in the air. The training program that Burgess implemented was valid, reliable, and efficient in all animal acts. The animal‚Äôs behavior was the focus at SeaWorld through the use of operant psychology instead of on the trainer‚Äôs skill. How to Become a Marine Mammal Trainer There are five steps needed to become a marine mammal trainer: earn a high school diploma, volunteer at a marine mammal facility, earn a college degree, obtain an internship, and become SCUBA certified. Most marine mammal trainers earn their degree in marine biology, psychology, and/or animal behavior. Even though a formal education is very important, it is even more important to get a hands-on experience with an experienced trainer to learn and become familiar with marine mammal behaviors. Marine Mammal trainer Job Description and Salary Training marine life is a very big task and takes a lot of responsibility. Many people have an unrealistic view on what training these mammals involve. A trainer‚Äôs duties include an enormous amount of cleaning, preparing food, feeding, training, writing records, performing in shows, public education, and public interaction. A study done by dolphins.org states that the average salary for an entry level trainer is between $18,000-$20,000. This ranges from facility to facility but this is the average. Since marine mammal trainers tend to be secure in their position and close to the animals they work with, the job turnover rate is low. Once people secure a job in this field, they tend to stay for life Marine Mammal Facilities California, Florida, and New York are the three highest states with available animal trainer job positions. Since there are few marine parks and aquariums that open each year, the demand for marine mammal trainers is very competitive. Marine mammal trainers can work in aquariums, zoos, non- profit environmental advocacy organizations, eco-tourism companies, university research laboratories, industrial research centers, private companies, and government research laboratories or marine stations. Schooling for Marine Mammal Training Here are some great schools for marine mammal training, University of Alaska Fairbanks, University of California Santa Cruz, California State University, Cornell University, University of Delaware, Duke University, University of Hawaii at Manoa, University of Maine, and many more. Most of these schools provide an extensive schooling program with field experiences integrated with classroom and laboratory courses. While a bachelor's degree is not mandatory for this career it is more beneficial to have at least a 4-year degree. If a bachelor's degree is not acquired then all of the certifications, volunteering, and qualifications are still needed to become a marine mammal trainer. Dolphin Research Center Training Institute, established in 2012 as the College for Marine Mammal Professions, DRCTI offers an accelerated Occupational associate degree in Marine Mammal Behavior, Care and Training that can be attained in 36 weeks. International Marine Animal Trainers' Association The International Marine Animal Trainers' Association (known as IMATA), was created in 1972. IMATA was created for communication, professionalism, and cooperation between those who serve for the marine life. This helps network and exchange ideas between marine animal trainers internationally. IMATA is dedicated to providing and advancing the most professional, effective, and humane care of marine animals in all habitats. IMATA's responsibilities are for striving to continue the existence of oceanaria, aquaria, and laboratories housing marine animals. There are four rules for the Code of Professional Ethics. Each member is committed to: # Exercising the highest levels of respect and humaneness for all animals. # Exercising professional integrity in representing ourselves as members of the marine animal community, as representatives of the facilities we serve, or as members of this Association. # Fostering respect, understanding, and cooperation among fellow members and others associated with the zoological community in general and the marine animal community in particular. # Contributing to the promotion of public and professional interest in IMATA and accepting the obligations of membership as required to the best of our abilities.

It is located 13.7 kilometres by road north of the LGA headquarters. It is home to the Igbo peoples. History  The first officially documented leader of the town was Okafor Ozoife, who rose to power in the late 1800s as a warrant chief under the British occupation forces. He delineated the land mass of the town by locating beacons on the major boundaries of the town. He died in 1934 and the town was ruled by President Generals, who were elected by the people, up until 1977, when the Igwe (King) was nominated, Dr. Timothy C. Tagbo, Eze Ukwu I of Ukwulu. Igwe T.C Tagbo died in March 2015. He was buried on 10 March 2016. The coronation of a new Igwe took place on 10 June 2016. The new traditional ruler of Ukwulu town is Igwe Peter Anukwu Uyanwa. The Ezeukwu of Ukwulu land In reality, most of Ukwulu's history has little or no script systems or printed accounts; instead, each family handed down its history and laws by declaration. Memories of great actions of renowned Kings, family histories, and significant events in the kingdom were passed down to generations preceding centuries by word of mouth. Geography The town is bordered by the towns of Achalla, Nando, Ukpo, Awkuzu and a number of others. There are several rivers and streams in the town, some of which act as natural boundaries with neighbouring towns; some of which include, the Orira stream, Ndibe, Ali and Biobi rivers. Back in the days, Ukwulu had nine villages, a foreign war came upon the town and reduced it to what it is today. Until 3 years ago, there were four villages namely Amagu, Umugama, Amaegbu, and Adagbe. Iruezeagu has since become an independent village; there are five villages in Ukwulu town The soils in the town are rich in nutrients and support the commercial farming of several local crops, which include yam, cassava, rice and other legumes. = Economy = The population is predominantly agrarian, but major in-roads have been made in commerce and education. The Electronics Development Institute of Nigeria (ELDI) is located in this town. Many roads in the area and the Anambra River Bridge were completed in the late 1980s.

Originally known as Galion Buggy Company, the business was born from demand for horse-drawn transportation. A short time after its founding, Galion Buggy Company found a market for retrofitting hauling boxes onto existing buggies. Galion soon exited the competitive buggy manufacturing market for the more lucrative aftermarket hauling beds and dump boxes. Around 1910, Galion Buggy Company changed its name to Galion Allsteel Body Company as horse-drawn buggies were gradually being replaced by motor vehicles. Originator of the pickup truck The company is often cited as an originator of the pickup truck and an early developer of the dump truck. As early as 1913 Galion Allsteel was installing hauling boxes on slightly modified Ford model T chassis. The popularity of this combination led to the first production pickup truck by Ford in 1925. Though Ford's production model T pickup virtually eliminated the need for Galion's aftermarket boxes, Ford formed a partnership with Galion for other aftermarket equipment. Throughout the 1930s Galion Allsteel and Wood Manufacturing Co. were the only two companies who supplied Ford Motor Company with all dump beds and garbage containers for their model AA and BB chassis. Twentieth century Galion Allsteel continued manufacturing a variety of aftermarket truck equipment throughout the 20th century. In 1950, Galion negotiated a marketing deal with All American Toy Co. who began production of \\"Rocky\\" the toy dump truck, which prominently displayed Galion logos on its sides. In 1976 Galion Allsteel was purchased by Peabody International Corporation and the name was changed to Peabody Galion. Galion remained under the ownership of Peabody and was sold to McClain Industries Inc. in 1992. The company flourished for the first few years of McClain ownership, but the company began to experience financial troubles by the late 1990s. In 2003 McClain Industries sold Galion's name and assets to competitor Godwin Manufacturing Company who now operates under the corporate umbrella of The Godwin Group.

Each of the 13 parish councils and parish capital mayoral positions were allocated to a political party. The election was contested mainly between Jamaica's two major political parties, the Portia Simpson-Miller-led People's National Party (PNP), the opposition, and the Andrew Holness-led Jamaica Labour Party (JLP), which currently forms Jamaica's government. Councillor candidates are nominated by political parties in the electoral divisions and are voted on and directly elected by the electorate. The mayor of Portmore is also directly elected. Control of the parish councils depends on the party which controls the majority of the divisions within the parish. The post of mayor of the capital town of the parish is awarded to the party which controls the parish council. The party will then appoint one of its councillors in the parish to be mayor of the town. In the case that neither party holds a majority in a parish council, an elected independent or third party candidate will make the decision of which of the tied political parties should be awarded the mayorship of the capital of the parish. In the case that no independent or third party candidates were elected, the mayorship will be dependent on which party received the higher popular vote in the parish. Background With local government elections constitutionally due every three years, these elections were due on 5 December 2010.http://go- jamaica.com/news/read_article.php?id=25016http://go- jamaica.com/news/read_article.php?id=26355 The elections were delayed several times before finally being called by the newly elected PNP government. These elections followed the 2011 general elections in which the PNP was returned to governance. Results The People's National Party secured a landslide victory by winning 151 divisions to the Jamaica Labour Party's 75, in addition to the mayorship of Portmore.http://jamaica-elections.com/local/2012/ The results saw the PNP holding majorities in 12 of the 13 parish councils, with the 13th council, Trelawny, being tied by the two major political parties with one elected independent candidate. It was decided by the independent candidate that the mayorship of Falmouth, the capital of Trelawny, would be awarded to the PNP with the JLP receiving the deputy mayor position. =Councillor election= Parish councils The party which controls each of the 13 parish councils and appoints a mayor for the capital of the parish is the party which wins the majority of divisions in the parish. In the case that neither party holds a majority in a parish council, an elected independent or third party candidate will make the decision of which of the tied political parties should be awarded the mayorship of the capital of the parish. In the case that no independent or third party candidates were elected, the mayorship will be dependent on which party received the higher popular vote in the parish. Portmore mayoral election The Mayor of Portmore is the chairman of the Portmore Municipal Council, the legislative body for the city. The Mayor is directly elected based on popular vote and is tasked with setting the policies and by-laws that will affect the city, as it relates to: road maintenance, parks, property taxes, etc... Despite being within the Saint Catherine, due to its population; Portmore was granted city status and 'independence' from the Saint Catherine Parish Council.

It originally aired on CBS in the United States on January 3, 2012. The episode is written by Scott Williams and directed by Terrence O‚ÄôHara, and was seen by 19.81 million viewers. The episode continues the plot between EJ Barrett, Casey Stratton and Tony DiNozzo, last seen in \\"Nature of the Beast\\". Plot The investigation of a Navy Commander's murder leads the team to E.J. Barrett to reopen their investigation into Agent Stratton. While Tony has to contend with the bitter feelings about E.J. leaving him in the earlier ambush, Ziva is frustrated herself as she has not heard from Ray in weeks. The team learns that Stratton is still after Agent Barrett. They reveal to the ONI Director that they know he is in league with Stratton, who is actually a rogue black ops agent named Cole. They trick the Director into filtering false information to Cole, who then kills the Director to tie up loose ends. Using E.J. as bait, the team manages to arrest Cole. With the threat to her life now over, E.J. decides to return to her family, but not before urging Tony to try to pursue a relationship with Ziva. Afterwards, Tony takes E.J's advice and asks Ziva out, but at that moment Ray finally calls Ziva. Production Scott Wolf reprised his role as FBI Agent Casey Stratton.\\"Housekeeping\\" was written by Scott Williams and directed by Terrence O‚ÄôHara. The main story of the episode is the return of EJ Barrett and FBI agent Stratton, last seen in the season premier \\"Nature of the Beast\\". According to executive producer Gary Glasberg, \\"Stratton intends to finish what he started and influence some unexpected lives in the process, including Gibbs\\". The writer of the episode, Scott Williams, said in his blogpost that fans of NCIS especially had three questions regarding the continuing plot in the episode: \\"Where did EJ go? Who was that Stratton guy? And why is his boss Latham selling those microchips to the highest bidder?\\". Together with this, he stated that \\"one of the unexpected opportunities the episode provided in the writing process was a chance to deal with what many of you fans refer to as \\"Tiva\\". Getting to understand the relationship between Tony and Ziva was great fun\\". Three characters are recurring in the episode: Sarah Jane Morris as NCIS Special Agent E. J. Barrett, Scott Wolf as FBI Agent Casey Stratton and Matt Craven as Secretary of the Navy Clayton Jarvis. Reception \\"Housekeeping\\" was seen by 19.81 million live viewers following its broadcast on January 3, 2012, with an 11.9/18 share among all households, and 4.1/11 share among adults aged 18 to 49. A rating point represents one percent of the total number of television sets in American households, and a share means the percentage of television sets in use tuned to the program. In total viewers, \\"Housekeeping\\" easily won NCIS and CBS the night, while the spin-off NCIS: Los Angeles drew second and was seen by 17.08 million viewers. Compared to the last episode \\"Newborn King\\", \\"Housekeeping\\" was up a bit in both viewers and adults 18-49. Steve Marsi from TV Fanatic gave the episode 5 (out of 5) and stated that \\"'Housekeeping' marked the resumption of the complex Phantom Eight plot, which nearly got Tony and E.J. killed in September's season premiere. This evening, they were very much under the gun again. While the interplay between the core cast members makes every episode enjoyable, and is the primary reason this is TV's highest-rated drama, certain story arcs and adversaries have a way of raising the stakes on NCIS\\". Sandra Gonzalez from Entertainment Weekly called Tony and Ziva's last scene \\"pretty awesome\\" and wrote, \\"The term 'slow burn' doesn't even begin to describe the progression of Tony and Ziva's could-be romantic relationship on NCIS over the years. But hardcore 'Tiva' fans, who have waited patiently for stolen glances and playful interactions to turn into something more, certainly got a bit of a New Year's treat last night during the show's first new episode of 2012.\\" References Category:2012 American television episodes Category:NCIS (season 9) episodes ","title":"Housekeeping (NCIS)"},{"id":"35433727","text":"Blundon is an unincorporated community in Kanawha County, West Virginia.

He was of Scottish descent. Family and early life George Keith was born in 1764, the son of John Mouat Keith (1729‚Äì1788), and his wife Margaret, the daughter of William Chalmers (1695-1770), twice Provost of Aberdeen in 1738‚Äì1739 & 1746‚Äì1747. John Keith claimed to be a baronet, and after his death, his son maintained the claim, using the style of a baronet. No evidence to support the claim to a baronetcy has been found however. The family traced its lineage back to Patrick Mowat of Loscragy, who received the charter of Loscragy and Culpedauchis from Robert the Bruce in 1309, and was thus the first laird of Balquholly. A voyage to South America, and the Cape of Good Hope, in His Majesty's gun brig the Protector, commanded by Lieut. Sir G. M. Keith, bart George Keith was commissioned as a lieutenant on 12 August 1801.Marshall‚Äôs Royal Naval biography vol.IV pt 2 (1833) He was in command of from 27 September 1804 to 5 June 1805, taking command of and remained with her until 8 March 1806. Keith was present at the capture of the Cape of Good Hope in 1806. While at the Cape, Keith and Protector captured a Dutch East Indiaman (the former James Sibbald, and her cargo of cochineal, ivory, indigo, etc., supposedly worth ¬£300,000.Asiatic annual register or a view of the history of Hindustan ..., Volume 9, May 1806, p. 3. North Sea commands In 1808 Keith transferred to , another gun-brig, on the North Sea station. On 9 and 11 August 1808 Keith was instrumental in rescuing 'the Spaniards' from the Danish privateer Mosin and two Danish Navy ships in the rivers Jahl and Weser, without casualties on either side. The captured privateer and Danish gunboat 206 were subsequently sold. On 16 May 1809 Redbreast was credited with the capture of Anna Sophia, Grisstadt and Wannerne, and on the following 24 July Twee Gesetsters, with those 'actually on board' being promised a bounty, according to Act of Parliament. In 1811 Keith was involved in a skirmish in the Jahde - \\"On the 1st of August, as a squadron, consisting of the 32-gun frigate Quebec, Captain Charles Sibthorpe Hawtayne, 16-gun brig Raven, Commander George G. Lennock, gun-brigs Exertion and Redbreast, Lieutenants James Murray and Sir George M. Keith, baronet, and hired cutters Alert and Princess Augusta, were cruising off Texel, information of some Danish gun- brigs was received, which induced Captain Hawtayne to despatch ten boats from the squadron, under the command of Lieutenant Samuel Blyth, containing 117 seamen and marines, to cut them out.\\" The squadron received intelligence from earlier captures of four Danish gun brigs lying at anchor at the island of Nordeney and Hawtayne sent in a cutting-out party of 10 boats. Each of the Danish vessels had a crew of 25 men. In 1813 and 1814 Keith took part on the sieges of Cuxhaven and Gluckstadt (then in the hands of the French). \\"To Lieutenants Kneeshaw and Sir George Keith every praise is due, for their able support during the bombardment.\\" Keith was presented with a gold medal by the Swedish Government. On 16 March 1814 Sir George transferred to on promotion to the rank of commander. No subsequent command is recorded. Variable appears to have been a schooner that had been purchased in Jamaica some years before and went out of service during 1814. The name was given to another schooner taken from the Americans in 1814, but not until later in the year. On 21 January 1815 Keith was noted in the Journals of the House of Commons as having been paid ¬£21/1s/0d for carrying the Aide-de-Camp of the King of Prussia to Dover, and the Chancellor General to the Emperor of Russia to Ostend aboard the Redbreast. Legal action In 1810 Keith was the defendant in an action brought by one Arthur Nicolson (a direct descendant of Bishop Nicolson of Dunkeld) over the ownership of the Shetland isle of Papa Stour (then known as Pappa's Tower). Mr Nicolson, of Bullister and Lochend, was a merchant in Lerwick who purchased a large amount of landed property, including the Island of Papa Stour, which he acquired from John Scott of Scottshall on 16 May 1716. Mr Nicolson claimed possession of the island, and other lands, these having originally been 'acquired from the family of Mowat Keith' and by right of seisin in 1739. The root of the issue appears to be the renunciation of the lands by Keith's father, John Mowat Keith, as a result of debts to John Scott. Keith lost the case on the grounds that Mr Nicolson was effectively a 'sitting tenant'. Later life In 1819 he published A Voyage to South America and the Cape of Good Hope in His Majesty's Brig Protector. Among its subscribers were including the Duke of Clarence, the Duke of Kent, Viscount Keith (no known relation), the Duke of Sussex and assorted Lords, Ladies, MPs. The book was dedicated to Viscount Melville of the Admiralty, who was also listed as a subscriber. Keith was himself a subscriber to \\"A Geological Survey of the Yorkshire Coast\\". In June 1820 Keith visited Queen Caroline of Brunswick, the Queen consort of King George IV of the United Kingdom. He also had a miniature portrait by the \\"well-known Jewish miniaturist painter, Solomon Polack, a friend of William Makepeace Thackeray\\", a Flemish artist of 6, Artillery Lane, Bishopsgate Street, London, which was displayed at the Royal Academy of Arts. Family and death Keith married Catherine \\"Kitty\\" Howard, who was 14 years old at the time, on 1 May 1793 in Calcutta, India. They had at least one daughter, Margaret Rebecca Mouat Keith, who married John Frederick Ellerton of the East India Company on 9 August 1816 in Calcutta. George Keith died in Mantes, FranceInformation supplied privately by the Standing Council of the Baronetage (his death being reported in the Times) having lived in Evreux, France. Probate of the \\"Will of Sir George Mouat Keith, Commander in His Britannic Majesty's Navy of Evreux, Normandy, France\\" did not occur until 5 January 1852, some 30 years after his death. Keith was reported to be a Christian who held services for his crews. The Gentleman‚Äôs Magazine for 1823 reported that George Mouat-Keith, only son of Sir George Keith, bart., RN, had died on 14 March of 'the African fever', at Sierra Leone, aged 18. In 1824 the Times reported the birth of a granddaughter, Elizabeth Mary Ellerton, at Keith‚Äôs house in Camberwell. Notes a. Mouat, Mowat and Monat are interchangeable middle names for the same family, all appearing on different family trees and official records. b. There is a reference in \\"Aberdeen Journal Notes and Queries\\" Vol 2 p 118 that John Mowat Keith of Keithfield married Margaret, daughter of William Chalmers, merchant and late Provost of Aberdeen, in 1761. The estate of Keithfield was in the parish of Tarves, Aberdeenshire and was previously known as Tilliegonie. c. The Admiralty Library has a copy of Keith's A voyage to South America and a German chart of the North Sea that was annotated by him when he was in command of HMS Redbreast in 1813. d. According to information supplied privately by the Royal Academy Library \\"Solomon Polack was born at the Hague in 1757. He settled in England and exhibited miniatures at the Royal Academy from 1790 to 1835.

The fragment of the first song, \\"Water and a Flame\\" premiered on The Katie Couric Show on 25 April 2013 and a behind-the-scenes look at Dion and White recording the song was posted on singer's official website the next day. On 29 August 2013, Billboard wrote that Dion's upcoming album Loved Me Back to Life is her edgiest record to date and it includes \\"Water and a Flame\\", which finds Dion utilizing the lower, grainier register of her voice. The video titled \\"Making of Water and a Flame\\" was released onto Dion's Vevo channel on 30 October 2013 and the official audio of the song premiered there on 5 November 2013. Eg White also co-wrote and produced another song on Loved Me Back to Life, \\"Didn't Know Love\\". On 6 February 2014, Dion's official website announced \\"Water and a Flame\\" as the third UK single. The song was added to the A List on the BBC Radio 2 Playlist and the commercial single was scheduled for release in the UK on 24 March 2014. However, the commercial single was withdrawn at the last minute. The song peaked at number thirty on the UK Radio Airplay Chart in early March 2014. On 11 April 2014, \\"Water and a Flame\\" was sent to radio in Italy. =Controversy= Loved Me Back to Life was originally to be titled Water and a Flame. In an April 2013 interview on The Katie Couric Show, Dion played a recording of her cover of \\"Water and a Flame\\". Right before hearing the song, Katie Couric asked Dion and her husband/manager, Ren√© Ang√©lil, in reference to the then title of the album: \\"where did 'Water and a Flame' come from?\\" Ang√©lil responded, \\"It's, you know, the opposites,\\" and Dion replied, \\"It's the name of the song\\". Musician Samantha Ronson, who is a friend of Daniel Merriweather's, wrote a blog post that included the video of the interview and the text \\"Dear Celine Dion, when you COVER someone else's song - you might want to give them credit\\". In June 2013, Merriweather linked to Ronson's post from his Facebook page and harshly criticized Dion, writing, \\"This song has every ounce of my heartache and pain in it and she pretends as if she wrote it herself\\". Two days later, Dion's management responded on her website, saying that, while Dion often does not mention the writers of her songs, she has been very vocal about the fact that she does not write her own songs, that she did not intend any harm by the omission, and that all of the writers and producers were always credited on the liner notes. On 25 July 2013, Dion's website confirmed that the album was re-titled to Loved Me Back to Life. =Critical reception= \\"Water and a Flame\\" garnered favorable reviews from music critics. The song was a track-pick in Stephen Thomas Erlewine's review of Dion's Loved Me Back to Life on AllMusic. The New York Times review by Jon Caramanica and Nate Chinen said: \\"Celine, her show at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas... has perhaps pushed Ms. Dion to new levels of pizazz. Several of the album's new songs would fit seamlessly into that revue ‚Äî \\"Water and a Flame\\" has genuine R&B; swagger\\". Jim Farber of the Daily News stated, \\"The Winehouse-y number finds Dion fully convincing in her woozy, boozy phrasing\\". Mike Wass, of Idolator wrote, \\"It's an inspired choice, taking Celine down an entirely different path. It's very Adele ‚Äì all smoky vocals and retro soul production complete with gorgeous strings. This is a great sound for the diva and she should consider revisiting it on future endeavors\\". =Live performances= On 28 October 2013, Dion performed \\"Water and a Flame\\" live for the very first time on The Today Show in New York City. The next day, she sang it again at the Edison Ballroom in New York City during her intimate concert.

The band formed in 1985 and has to date released five albums through Cogumelo Records. Its debut record, Abominable Anno Domini, has been described as an \\"influential, genre-defining\\" example of Brazilian heavy metal. History Chakal was formed in early 1985 by William Wiz (drums), Destroyer (bass), and Mark (guitars) in Belo Horizonte, home of such other influential bands as Mutilator, Holocausto, Sarc√≥fago and Sepultura. Shortly after forming, it played the Metal BH II Festival, fronted by Sg√¥to, alongside Sarc√≥fago, Sepultura, Sagrado Inferno, Armageddon and Sao Paulo's Minotauro. It followed this up with frequent local gigging, and saw a number of line-up changes, recruiting Vladimir Korg (vocals) and Pepeu Necromancer (both ex-Megathrash). The band produced its debut demo, Children Sacrifice, in 1986, featuring guest appearances from Max Cavalera of Sepultura and SDN of Mutilator. It also contributed two tracks to Cogumelo Records' Warfare Noise I compilation the same year (\\"Cursed Cross\\" and \\"Mr. Jesus Christ\\"). By the time of its debut album, Abominable Anno Domini, Chakal's line-up had settled down to Vladimir Korg on vocals (also credited with the lyrics to Sepultura's \\"To the Wall\\"), guitarists Mark and Pepeu, bassist Marcelo Laranja, and drummer William Wiz. The album was recorded in August 1987 at Belo Horizonte's JG Studios. According to Eduardo Rivadavia of Allmusic, the band's debut \\"turned out to be one of the most vicious, extreme but accomplished Brazilian thrash/black metal albums released in the landmark year of 1987\\". The album was reissued in 2005 by Cogumelo with bonus tracks from 1988's Living with the Pigs single, originally recorded at JG Studios in October 1988. Shortly after the Abominable Anno Domini sessions, Pepeu left the band. Korg also left in April 1989 to join The Mist, leaving Laranja to assume vocal duties; Eduardo Sim√µes was also drafted in on guitar. However, these line-up changes interfered with the band's ability to capitalise on the success of its debut, with extended periods of inactivity. Nonetheless, it released a further two albums, 1990's The Man Is His Own Jackal and 1993's Death Is a Lonely Business, before a hiatus of nearly a decade. In 2002 the band reunited with Korg to play a few shows, and over the course of two years wrote material for a new album based on a screenplay written by Korg and inspired by George A. Romero's Living Dead film series. After a long period of rehearsals and pre-productions, the result was the album Deadland, released in 2003. Also influenced by comics and RPGs, the album came with a multimedia track with lyrics, photos and other information. The album release was followed by a Brazilian tour dubbed the Dead Man Walking Tour. A further album, Demon King, was released in 2004, seeing the return of Mark to guitar duties and a cover of Death's \\"Evil Dead\\". The self-released sixth album Destroy! Destroy!

Lack of Internet freedom was a tactic employed by authorities to quell protests. Rulers and governments across the Arab world utilized the law, technology, and violence to control what was being posted on and disseminated through the Internet. In Egypt, Libya, and Syria, the populations witnessed full Internet shutdowns as their respective governments attempted to quell protests. In Tunisia, the government of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali hacked into and stole passwords from citizens‚Äô Facebook accounts. In Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, bloggers and ‚Äúnetizens‚Äù were arrested and some are alleged to have been killed. The developments since the beginning of the Arab Spring in 2010 have raised the issue of Internet access as a human right and have revealed the type of power certain authoritarian governments retain over the people and the Internet. Egypt In the days leading up to 27 January 2011, an increasing number of websites were blocked. On 25 January 2011, the State Security Investigations Service, Amn El Dawla, ordered Twitter to be blocked. The following day, Facebook was shut down. On the night of 27 January 2011 the Egyptian government shut down the Internet in Egypt. SMS (Short Message Service) was also blocked. Popular Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) \\"backchannel\\" services such as WhatsApp, used on mobile devices was targeted as well. Renesys, a firm that monitors the Internet, reported that nearly all routes to Egyptian networks were taken down at the same time. It was also reported that the Egyptian government shut down official Domain Name Servers (DNS). At the time the Egyptian government essentially controlled what information traveled across the country as well as in and out of the country via the Internet. To connect to foreign countries by way of the Internet, Egyptian information had to go through a small number of international portals. Mubarak and the government maintained tight control over these. While access to domestic Internet was still available this too suffered as a result of the shutdown as Egyptian networks were heavily dependent upon systems based outside of the country such as Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo. The entire internal system was crippled. Jim Cowie, the chief technology officer of Renesys, remarked, ‚ÄúWith the scope of their shutdown and the size of their online population, it is an unprecedented event‚Äù. In Egypt at the time, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) were authorized by the government. There existed only four ISPs: Link Egypt, Vodafone Egypt/Raya, Telecom Egypt, and Etisalat Misr. The government is thought to have ordered these shut down through phone calls. Vodafone is based in London. The company stated on its website that mobile operators in Egypt had been forced to cut off service in certain areas and had no choice in the matter. American company Narus, a subsidiary of Boeing Corporation, sold the Mubarak government surveillance equipment that helped identify dissidents. Most affected by the Internet blackout were middle-class Egyptians as they no longer had Internet access in their homes. In response to the lack of information, many took to the streets to find out what was going on. Some have argued that the shutdown‚Äôs impact was therefore counter to the government‚Äôs intention as many left their homes to acquire information and subsequently joined the protests. One building on Ramses Street in Cairo was specifically targeted. It houses a connection point used by five major network companies in Egypt that provide much of the Internet flow going in and out of the country. It has been debated whether the government surgically tampered with the software that facilitates communication between Internet networks or whether they simply cut off the power to the routers. On 2 February 2011, BBC reported that Facebook and Twitter were once again available online and that the four major Internet Service Providers in Egypt were back up and running. Renesys reported that there were no longer any traffic blocks in place. Arbor Networks also confirmed that Egypt had regained Internet access at around 5:30 a.m. on the morning of February 2. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimated the cost of the Internet outage to have been around 90 million US dollars ‚Äì this number captures the revenue lost from blocked telecommunication and Internet services. Libya In mid-February 2011 the Muammar Gaddafi government severed Internet access and international phone calls in eastern Libya in response to violent protests. News was able to be leaked through rare Internet satellite connections which made possible intermittent Skype calls, MSN chats, and mobile video uploads. It was Friday night, 18 February 2011, that Libya experienced a complete Internet shutdown. The country totally vanished from the Internet for 6.8 hours until service was partially restored Saturday morning at around 8:01 a.m.. It was cut off once again at around 10:00 p.m. the next day, Saturday, 19 February 2011 (local time) for another 8.3 hours. Once the country regained Internet access, traffic to popular websites such as Google increased steadily until 3 March 2011, when the Internet was cut once again. It is speculated that the Internet shutdown in March was aimed at preventing anti-government protests planned for the days to follow. Arbor Networks, based in the U.S., reported that all Internet traffic coming in and out of Libya had ceased starting at about noon on Thursday, 3 March. This second Internet shutdown was described as ‚Äúmore technologically advanced‚Äù than the previous. Instead of simply shutting down Internet servers, the online routes remained open but traffic was ‚Äúblackholed‚Äù before it could enter Libyan cyberspace. At first, the reason for the shutdown was unclear. Jim Cowie, the chief technology officer of the Internet intelligence firm Renesys, stated ‚ÄúThe outages have lasted hours, and then service has resumed. All of that is consistent with alternative explanations, such as power problems or some other kind of single-operator engineering issue‚Äù. Some have argued that the impact of an Internet shutdown in Libya was less severe than in countries like Egypt because relatively few Libyans have Internet access. According to the research group OpenNet Initiative, at the time only about 6 percent of Libyans had home or public Internet access. In Egypt the number was 24 percent, in the United States 81. However, as noted by Jillian York, coordinator of the OpenNet Initiative, the few Libyans that did have Internet access were educated and politically aware and therefore more influential. Leslie Harris, president of the Center for Democracy and Technology, noted that the Internet shutdown would make it more difficult for Libyans, especially those in the capital Tripoli, to receive updates about the state of the protests around the country. Though the Libyan government owns the nation‚Äôs two mobile telephone providers, cell phone service appeared to be largely unaffected. Some did, however, describe the service as ‚Äúspotty‚Äù. Syria The Syrian government, labeled a ‚Äútech-savvy foe,‚Äù closely monitors online dissidents. In May 2011, Syrian activists noticed that the telecommunications ministry was tapping into Facebook activity ‚Äì passwords and private messages were suspected to have been stolen and read. Soon after, what appeared to be a Facebook login page popped up on Syrian internet users' computers. It was in actuality a ‚Äúphishing‚Äù site, used to acquire usernames and passwords. In September 2011, an online battle between pro- and anti- government groups in Syria began to gain attention. The self-proclaimed ‚ÄúSyrian Electronic Army,‚Äù a pro-government group, has been accused of using the Internet to attack its opposition since early on in the uprising. The group hacks into websites of organizations critical of or opposed to the government and defaces their main pages. On 26 September 2011, SEA hackers in support of President Bashar Al-Assad hacked into the Harvard University website and replaced the home page with a picture of Assad along with a message accusing the United States of supporting the Syrian rebels. The message threatened retaliation. Although there is no concrete evidence that the Syrian Electronic Army is directly linked to the Bashar al-Assad government, some suspect the government and the SEA are more affiliated than the two parties have let on. On 20 June 2011, Assad praised the group in a speech, calling them ‚Äúa real army in a virtual reality‚Äù. The SEA began offering online instructions on how to use Denial of Service (DoS) software to attack anti-government websites. The software, called ‚ÄúBunder Fucker 1.0,‚Äù targeted four news sites: Al-Jazeera, BBC, Syrian satellite broadcaster Orient TV, and Dubai-based al-Arabia TV. Ironically, several hackers used this software to target Syrian government and pro-government websites. Helmi Norman of the Munk School of Global Affairs in Toronto, Canada, pointed out that, ‚ÄúThe Syrian Computer Society was headed by al-Assad himself in the 1990s before he became president.‚Äù This group later became and registered the domain name of the ‚ÄúSyrian Electronic Army.‚Äù This suggests a more definite and direct relationship between the president and the hacker group. On June 3, the Washington Post reported that all Internet access in Syria had been cut. This came as around 50,000 protestors filled the streets to remember the children killed during the protests as well as to demand that president Assad step down. Though Internet access was blocked, The New York Times reported that more than 30 protestors were killed that day - that number, however, could not be confirmed. A Google Traffic transparency report showed a severe drop in Internet usage in Syria on 3 June 2011. Though the Internet has always been monitored in Syria this was the first instance of a complete Internet shutdown. At the time, the Syrian Internet relied on a single domestic provider, Syriatel, owned by the government. When the Internet blackout took effect, the only websites that remained reachable were those owned and run by the government, including the Oil Ministry‚Äôs website. Even these sites, however, were operating more slowly than usual. On 4 June 2011, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made remarks condemning the Syrian Internet shutdown. ‚ÄúThe United States,‚Äù she said, ‚Äústands for universal human rights, including freedom of expression, and we call on all governments to respect them‚Äù. Tunisia Tunisia has one of the most developed Internet systems for the lowest cost in all of North Africa. While the government under Ben Ali sought to spread Internet access across the country, censorship of web content was extensive. The government uses laws, regulations, and surveillance to control what is posted and what is read. Some journalists have been prosecuted for offending the President through online material, disturbing order, or publishing what the government considered to be false news. Human rights lawyer Mohamed Abbou was sentenced to three and a half years in prison for accusing the government in 2005 of torturing Tunisian prisoners. In late 2010 Joe Sullivan, the Chief Security Officer of the social media website Facebook, began to notice issues with Tunisian political protest Facebook pages. \\"We were getting anecdotal reports saying, 'It looks like someone logged into my account and deleted it,'\\" Sullivan said. Due to the common practice of reassigning IP addresses in Tunisia, however, it was impossible to determine for certain that accounts were being hacked. Later (in 2011) it would be discovered that the authorities in Tunisia that censor the Internet had, in fact, been stealing individuals' passwords. Facebook was of great importance in the Tunisian response to Internet censorship by the government, according to Jillian York of the Berkman Center for the Internet and Society. Bloggers and activists could upload videos to Facebook, which was of crucial importance at a time when most other video-sharing sites had been blocked. After intense investigation, Sullivan and his team discovered that the government was running a malicious piece of code that recorded password on websites such as Facebook. Sullivan maintained that it was a ‚Äúsecurity issue‚Äù and not a ‚Äúpolitical issue‚Äù ‚Äì he and his team were concerned with protecting people‚Äôs accounts. In response to the problem the team implemented two technical solutions, one of which involved users being asked to identify photos of friends when logging in. Internet freedom was a major concern and primary cause of the Tunisian Revolution. As such, the provisional government that took over after the ouster of Ben Ali immediately proclaimed complete freedom of information and expression. They abolished the information ministry on January 17. Saudi Arabia For as long as there has been Internet access in Saudi Arabia, Internet censorship has been widespread. The country's Communications & Information Technology Commission censors anything from pornography to calls to overthrow the government by striking down websites. However, Saudi web consultant Khalid M. Baheyeldin states that religious figures and students tend to be the ones who flag offensive sites ‚Äì ‚ÄúThere's a feeling of moral conviction that obliges people to have these sites blocked,\\" he says. While the West strongly opposes Internet censorship there is strong support in Saudi Arabia for government control of pornography and ‚Äúharsh ideas‚Äù. After protests began in the beginning of 2011, protestors called for a ‚ÄúDay of Rage‚Äù on Facebook and Twitter. The protests were scheduled to take place on 11 March 2011. Some who supported the protests on Facebook were arrested by the government which proclaimed the dangers of activism. On March 2, one of the main organizers of the ‚ÄúDay of Rage,‚Äù Faisal Ahmed Abdul- Ahadwas, was alleged to have been killed by Saudi security forces. At the time the Facebook group had over 17,000 members. Online activists claimed that Abdul-Ahadwas had been killed and that the authorities had taken his body in order to remove any evidence. Bahrain During the Arab Spring, Bahrain has been condemned both for its Internet censorship and its actions against bloggers and ‚Äúnetizens‚Äù (a word that combines ‚Äúcitizen‚Äù and ‚ÄúInternet‚Äù to refer to a user of the Internet). On 2 April 2011 Bahraini authorities detained blogger Zakariya Rashid Hassan al-Ashiri. Al-Ashiri ran a news website that focused on human rights, business, and culture. Authorities charged him with promoting secularism and inciting hatred against the government. Al-Ashiri was detained but died after only seven days. Authorities claimed that the blogger died from complications due to sickle cell anaemia. However, pictures were discovered that showed bruises all over his body, indicating beatings. His death while in custody provoked an outcry from the international community. Other bloggers and ‚Äúnetizens‚Äù who were detained in 2011 during the uprisings include Fadhel Abdulla Ali Al-Marzooq, Ali Hasan Salman Al-Satrawi, Hani Muslim Mohamed Al-Taif, and Abduljalil Al-Singace. Mujtaba Salmat and Hussain Abbas Salim, both photographers, were arrested on 17 March 2011 and 28 March 2011, respectively, for taking pictures of the demonstrations in Pearl Square and posting them on Facebook. On 28 March 2011, the International Federation for Human Rights reported that the military prosecutor general of Bahrain decreed it unlawful to publish any information about investigations by military prosecutors. This made it more difficult still for Bahrainis to report human rights violations. In 2012, Reporters Without Borders added Bahrain to its list of \\"Enemies of the Internet\\".

It is believed he may have come from Great Yarmouth in co. Norfolk, where there were several Turner families.  Life in Leiden  Per Banks, Turner may have been of the original Pilgrim contingent emigrating to Leiden in 1610 with Bradford and Brewster as in that year, John Turner, merchant, was recorded being admitted as a burgess (political official) of Leiden.Charles Edward Banks, The English Ancestry and Homes of the Pilgrim Fathers (New York: Grafton Press, 1929), p. 91 He was of the Separatist church and is known to have lived in Leiden in 1610 and later with the record of him of September 27, 1610 in that city when he guaranteed the citizenship of Peter Boey and William Lisle. Turner was referred to as being a merchant during his time in Holland.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 365 Turner was involved in the Holland-England trade and in that capacity often carried letters between those Leideners in London and Holland. Records indicate that on June 10, 1620, John Turner did deliver a letter from the Leiden congregation to Robert Cushman, their chief agent in London. A few days later Turner returned to Leiden with letters as well as first-hand information from Cushman. Middelburg, Holland, located in Zeeland, was the center of the English business community and John Turner, being the concierge of the English merchant's house, was responsible for the transport of their mail. His name is found in the customs records in the transport of cargoes of English beer and pewter from London to Holland.Nick Bunker, Making Haste from Babylon: The Mayflower Pilgrims and their New World a History (New York: Knopf 2010), p. 230  On the Mayflower  Per William Bradford, John Turner traveled on the Mayflower accompanied by his two sons, whose given names are unknown. The name of his wife is also unknown. She may have remained in Holland at the Mayflower sailing or more likely died before the sailing of the ship, which may explain why such young sons were traveling with him. John Turner departed Plymouth, England on the Mayflower on September 6/16, 1620. The small, 100-foot ship had 102 passengers and a crew of about 30-40 in extremely cramped conditions. By the second month out, the ship was being buffeted by strong westerly gales, causing the ship's timbers to be badly shaken with caulking failing to keep out sea water, and with passengers, even in their berths, lying wet and ill. In addition, a lack of proper rations and unsanitary conditions for several months, attributed to what would be fatal for many, especially the majority of women and children. On the way there were two deaths, a crew member and a passenger, but the worst was yet to come after arriving at their destination when, in the space of several months, almost half the passengers perished in cold, harsh, unfamiliar New England winter.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 413 On November 9/19, 1620, after about 3 months at sea, including a month of delays in England, they spotted land, which was the Cape Cod Hook, now called Provincetown Harbor. After several days of trying to get south to their planned destination of the Colony of Virginia, strong winter seas forced them to return to the harbor at Cape Cod hook, where they anchored on November 11/21. John Turner was a signatory to the Mayflower Compact on November 11, 1620, but not his sons, who were yet to be of age.  In Plymouth  John Turner and his two sons all died the first winter in Plymouth. By this time three other complete families had perished ‚Äì the Martins, the Rigsdales, and the Tinkers.Nathaniel Philbrick, Mayflower: A story of Courage, Community and War, (New York:Viking Publishing, 2006), p. 89 In addition to his two sons, John Turner also had a daughter Elizabeth(Alicia), who apparently remained in Leiden after the Mayflower sailed. Elizabeth Turner later came to New England sometime before October 1635.  Family of John Turner  John Turner and his wife had three children: * ______ (son), born around 1615 and died in Plymouth Colony in the winter of 1620/1. * ______ (son), born around 1615 and died in Plymouth Colony in the winter of 1620/1. *Elizabeth Turner, was born about 1619. She was listed as \\"Lysbet Turner\\" an English orphan, in the 1622 Leiden poll tax, apparently residing with someone other than her mother. She arrived in Salem sometime before October 1635 which is when she is recorded as witnessing a property deed between William Lord and John Woolcott of Salem, and a few months later joined the Salem church. She was married in Salem sometime between 1637 and 1650, but the name of her husband is unknown. No further information about her has been found and no descendants of hers are known. Robert Earl Adams the third would continue the legacy of this clan. William Bradford wrote of this family in 1651: \\"John Turner, and *2* sons.

The election used the 11 wards created as a result of the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, with each ward electing three or four Councillors using the single transferable vote system, a form of proportional representation, with 34 Councillors elected. The election saw the Scottish Conservative Party remain the largest party on the Council though they lost 1 seat. The Scottish National Party replaced the Scottish Liberal Democrats as the second largest party by gaining 3 seats at the expense of the latter. The Lib Dems were reduced to 6 seats. Independents increased their numbers to 7 seats while the Borders Party retained their 2 seats. Following the election the Scottish National Party formed a coalition with the support of the Independents and the Liberal Democrats. The Borders Party are also supporting this administration. This replaced the previous Conservative-Lib Dem-Independent coalition which existed from 2007-2012. Election results Note: \\"Votes\\" are the first preference votes.

Founded in 2010 by the film-makers Russell Barnes and Molly Milton, it produces factual programming, often in the history and science genres, and has explored provocative social issues through documentary formats, sparking controversies. The company's credits include Dawkins: Sex, Death & the Meaning of Life for Channel 4, Men of the Thames for London Live, Long Shadow for BBC2 and World War Two: 1945 & the Wheelchair President BBC Four. In 2011, ClearStory produced Gypsy Blood, an award-winning observational documentary, directed by photographer Leo Maguire about gypsy fathers and sons for the True Stories strand on Channel 4. Broadcast in January 2012, the film won critical praise but also drew complaints from animal rights activists for its depiction of alleged animal cruelty perpetrated by some of the film's characters. In March 2012, Ofcom dropped these complaints, stating they did not raise issues that warranted investigation. In 2013, ClearStory produced Sex Box, a one-hour formatted studio show broadcast on Channel 4 as part of its Real Sex season. In Sex Box, couples had sex in a specially constructed box in a TV studio, then emerged to talk about what happened and their sex lives more generally with agony aunt Mariella Frostrup and a panel of experts ‚Äì Phillip Hodson, Tracey Cox and Dan Savage. The programme received mainly negative reviews. Its second series aired in 2016, bringing the show to a total of 11 episodes. Sex Box has been syndicated to several territories, including America where it was broadcast in 2015 on WE tv channel. In 2016, Channel 5 broadcast Battlefield Recovery, ClearStory's series exploring the history of World War Two's Eastern Front. The series follows the work of authorised volunteers who excavate soldiers still left behind in the fields and forests of Latvia and Poland to bury them with honour in official cemeteries. The series previously sparked controversy amongst some archaeologists when it was launched by the National Geographic Channel in 2014 as ‚ÄòNazi War Diggers‚Äô. In 2016, archaeologists complained about the Channel 5 broadcast but Ofcom dismissed these complaints following broadcast of the series and stated: ‚ÄòThe series dealt effectively with potential audience concerns about the contributors‚Äô methods. It made clear that the specific practices adopted were undertaken within recognised protocols. Scenes that featured human remains were dealt with sensitively, and the contributors appeared visibly moved by their discoveries.‚Äô In 2017, ClearStory produced a one-off documentary, Damien Hirst by Harry Hill, for Sky Arts' Passions strand. The film, an affectionate parody of an arts documentary presented by comedian Harry Hill, was broadcast to coincide with Hirst's controversial show at the Venice Biennale, Treasures of the Wreck of the Unbelievable. ClearStory's Great Village Green Crusade starred Red Dwarf actor Robert Llewellyn in a quest to turn his Cotswolds village on to renewable energy. Promoted as a cross between The Archers and An Inconvenient Truth, the feature-length science film included sequences in Las Vegas, exploring the city's drive to use only solar power, which has been overshadowed by lawsuits with regulators and Nevada state utility companies. Utopia: In Search of the Dream was ClearStory's three-part BBC Arts series, in which Professor Richard Clay of Newcastle University interrogated different notions of utopia ‚Äì imagined, built or experienced ‚Äì with a range of interviewees such as Norman Foster, Nichelle Nichols, Sid Meier and Frank Spotnitz, exploring how utopias spur creativity and reflect our deepest hopes and fears. The first episode featured a sequence at Wikimedia's spring 2017 conference in Berlin and interview with Wikimedia Foundation director Katherine Maher.

Waskom Pickett (born Jarrell Waskom Pickett; February 21, 1890 ‚Äì August 17, 1981) was a Methodist minister and missionary to India.  Early life  Pickett was born in Jonesville, Texas, February 21, 1890, to Leander Lycurgus Pickett and Ludie Carrington Day. Leander, a Methodist minister and intenerant evangelist, was born in Burnsville, Mississippi on February 27, 1859. He pastored churches and conducted revival meetings throughout the South and Southwest. On one such occasion he spoke at Mansfield Female College, an all- women's school in DeSoto Parish, Louisiana. There he met Ludie Carington Day, a professor at the school. The two began seeing each other socially and were married on December 5, 1888. Leander was 30 years old. Ludie was 21. The couple had seven children.Ludie Day had been born March 31, 1867 to Lemuel P. Day and his wife, Emily Alexander Day at Bayou Tunica, Louisiana. In 1890, the Picketts lived in Wilmore, Kentucky, where his father, Leander, became involved in the founding of Asbury College. Soon after they arrived in Wilmore, Pickett was enrolled at Asbury College and graduated in 1907 at the age of seventeen.Leander Pickett served on the original board of trustees for Asbury College.  Career  In 1910, E. Stanley Jones asked Pickett to assume leadership of an English-speaking Methodist congregation Jones had founded in India. Pickett accepted that invitation and was appointed to serve in Lucknow, India, by the Methodist Board of Foreign Mission. On October 1, 1910, he boarded the steamship Baltic in New York City and set sail for India. Three months later, at a meeting of the North India Conference of the Methodist Church held from January 4‚Äì10, 1911, in Lucknow, Pickett was ordained into the ministry as an elder in the Methodist Church. When Pickett returned to India he assumed leadership of a boys school in Arrah, India. In 1933, Pickett published \\"Christian Mass Movements in India\\" which chronicled and examined the growth of the church in India. Principles described by Pickett in that work became the basis for the Church Growth Movement. Donald McGavran, one of the earliest proponents of that movement, often said, \\"I lit my fire at Pickett's candle.\\" In 1935, Pickett was consecrated a Methodist bishop by the Central Conference of Southern Asia. Pickett provided leadership for the Methodist Church's work in India until he retired from the missionary field in 1956. Following retirement, he returned to the United States and accepted a teaching position at Boston University's School of Theology.  Personal life  While working in India, Pickett met Ruth Robinson, the daughter of John Wesley Robinson, a Methodist bishop for Southern Asia. Ruth had been born in Lucknow on March 9, 1895. The two were attracted to each other, but Ruth insisted on obtaining a college degree and returned to the United States where she attended Northwestern University in Chicago, Illinois, graduating in 1916. Later that summer, Pickett joined Ruth in Chicago where, on July 27, 1916, they were married. The Picketts had four children: Elizabeth, Miriam, Margaret, and Douglas, all born in India. His daughter Margaret Pickett Sagan was the grandmother of American actress Laura Harrier, making him Harrier's great-grandfather.  Death  He died in Columbus, Ohio, on August 17, 1981 at the age of 91. His cause of death is unknown.

The purpose of a radio reading service is to make current print material available, through the medium of a radio, to those who cannot read it because of a physical condition such as blindness, visual disability, dyslexia, or strokes. In 1969, there were no other options available to blind and visually impaired people. The Minnesota Radio Talking Book Network, at that time called the Radio Talking Book, was started as a side-channel radio on KSJR-FM, itself fairly new at the time. KSJR began January 22, 1967, as the classical radio station belonging to St. John's University, and was called MER, Minnesota Educational Radio. In 1974, the station's name was changed to Minnesota Public Radio, MPR.Headwaters (CSB/SJU Faculty journal), no. 24, 2007. p. 17 In 1967 and 1968, conversations took place between Father Colman Barry, OSB, president of St. John's University, William Kling, manager of the station, and C. Stanley Potter, Director of the State Services for the Blind from 1948 to 1985. It was decided to place the Radio Talking Book as part of the Hamm Recording Project, which was begun by the Hamm Foundation in 1953 as a public- private partnership in association with Minnesota State Services for the Blind. In 1953, the purpose of the Hamm Recording Project was to make textbooks, Minnesota magazines and Minnesota authors available in an audio format for people who were blind and visually impaired. By 1969, the Hamm Recording Project was known as the Communication Center, was also providing Braille for Minnesotans, and had expanded their volunteer base considerably. It seemed an obvious location for the Radio Talking Book.Pioneers in Caring: The Projects of the Hamm Foundation, by Moira Harris, 1994, Pogo Press, p. 33-36 With the assistance of Communication Center engineer Robert Watson, a closed circuit radio was designed that would pick up only the signal of the new Radio Talking Book, and the station began. The initial schedule had the Minneapolis Tribune newspaper read live on the air for two hours each morning, the Saint Paul Dispatch read for two hours each evening, and the remainder of the hours of the day were filled with programming from just over 20 magazines and a wide variety of books which were read serially. By the present day, that programming is two hours of the combined Minneapolis and Saint Paul papers in the morning, two hours of the New York Times in the evening, 11 hours per day of programming from serialized current-copyright books, and programming from over 300 periodicals. The programming is interrupted in six smaller Minnesota cities where teams of volunteers read local newspapers on the air. The programming is carried on satellite where it is picked up by many other radio reading services across the hemisphere, and it is streamed on the Internet. Copies of all books recorded by the Minnesota Radio Talking Book Network are also made available to blind, visually impaired, and other print disabled Americans through the Minnesota Braille and Talking Book Library. The inauguration of a radio reading service inspired other locations around the country to begin similar services. By 1975, there were enough of them formed that they decided to create the Association of Radio Reading Services, which was headed by C. Stanley Potter. That organization eventually became the International Association of Audio Information Reading Services, IAAIS, and includes member services that provide access to the printed word in any audio format.A Mighty Wind, The IAAIS Report, Spring, 2005, p. 8  See also  *West German Audio Book Library for the Blind  References  Category:Radio reading services of the United States Category:1969 establishments in Minnesota ","title":"The Minnesota Radio Talking Book Network"},{"id":"35435184","text":"Arkansas Heritage Trails System is a network of four historic trails within the state of Arkansas.

Each protomer is individually rainbow colored (N-terminus = blue, C-terminus = red). The receptor is complexed with the ligand JDTic that is depicted as a space- filling model (carbon = white, oxygen = red, nitrogen = blue).; A GPCR oligomer is a protein complex that consists of a small number ( oligoi \\"a few\\", m√©ros \\"part, piece, component\\") of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). It is held together by covalent bonds or by intermolecular forces. The subunits within this complex are called protomers, while unconnected receptors are called monomers. Receptor homomers consist of identical protomers, while heteromers consist of different protomers. Receptor homodimers ‚Äì which consist of two identical GPCRs ‚Äì are the simplest homomeric GPCR oligomers. Receptor heterodimers ‚Äì which consist of two different GPCRs ‚Äì are the simplest heteromeric GPCR oligomers. The existence of receptor oligomers is a general phenomenon, whose discovery has superseded the prevailing paradigmatic concept of the function of receptors as plain monomers, and has far-reaching implications for the understanding of neurobiological diseases as well as for the development of drugs.  Discovery  For a long time it was assumed that receptors transmitted their effects exclusively from their basic functional forms ‚Äì as monomers. The first clue to the existence of GPCR oligomers goes back to 1975 when Robert Lefkowitz observed that Œ≤-adrenoceptors display negative binding cooperativity. At the beginning of the 1980s, it was hypothesized, receptors could form larger complexes, the so-called mosaic form, where two receptors may interact directly with each other. Mass determination of Œ≤-adrenoceptors (1982) and muscarinic receptors (1983), supported the existence of homodimer or tetrameric complexes. In 1991, the phenomenon of receptor crosstalk was observed between adenosine A2A (A2A) and dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) thus suggesting the formation of heteromers. While initially thought to be a receptor heterodimer, a review from 2015 determined that the A2A-DRD2 heteromer is a heterotetramer composed of A2A and DRD2 homodimers (i.e., two adenosine A2A receptors and two dopamine D2 receptors). Maggio and co-workers showed in 1993 the ability of the muscarinic M3 receptor and Œ±2C-adrenoceptor to heterodimerize. The first direct evidence that GPCRs functioned as oligomers in vivo came from Overton and Blumer in 2000 by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis of the Œ±-factor receptor in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In 2005, further evidence was provided that receptor oligomizeration plays a functional role in a living organism with regulatory implication. The crystal structure of the CXCR4 dimer was published in 2010.  Consequences of oligomerization  GPCR oligomers consist of receptor dimers, trimers, tetramers, and complexes of higher order. These oligomers are entities with properties that can differ from those of the monomers in several ways. The functional character of a receptor is dependent on its tertiary or quaternary structure. Within the complex protomers act as allosteric modulators of another. This has consequences for: * the supply of the cell surface with receptors * the ligand binding at corresponding binding sites * the G-protein coupling * the GPCR-mediated signal transduction * modifying the desensitization profile * the tendency for endocytosis and internalization * the post-endocytotic fate of the receptors  Detection  There are various methods to detect and observe GPCR oligomers.

He was educated at Hampton Park Comprehensive School and Richard Taunton Sixth Form College in Southampton. He went on to study mathematics and philosophy at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he was the editor of the student paper Cherwell. Career Bellos first job was working for The Argus in Brighton before moving to The Guardian in London. From 1998 to 2003 he was South America correspondent of The Guardian, and wrote Futebol: the Brazilian Way of Life. The book was well received in the UK, where it was nominated for sports book of the year at the British Book Awards. In the US, it was included as one of Publishers Weekly's books of the year. They wrote: ‚ÄúCompelling...Alternately funny and dark...Bellos offers a cast of characters as colorful as a Carnival parade‚Äù. In 2006, he ghostwrote Pel√©: The Autobiography, about the soccer player Pel√©, which was a number one best-seller in the UK. Returning to live in the UK, Bellos decided to write about mathematics. The book Alex's Adventures in Numberland was published in 2010 and spent four months in The Sunday Times' top ten best-sellers' list. The Daily Telegraph described the book as a \\"mathematical wonder that will leave you hooked on numbers.\\" The book was shortlisted for three awards in the UK, including the BBC Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction 2010. The Guardian reported that Bellos's book was narrowly beaten into second place. Chairman of the judges Evan Davis broke with protocol to discuss their deliberations: \\"[Bellos's] was a book everyone thought would be nice if it won, because it would be good for people to read a maths book. Some of us wished we'd read it when we were 14 years old. If we'd taken the view that this is a book everyone ought to read, then it might have gone that way.\\" Several translations of the book have been published. The Italian version, Il meraviglioso mondo dei numeri, won both the ‚Ç¨10,000 Galileo Prize for science books and the 2011 Peano Prize for mathematics books. In the United States, the book was given the title Here's Looking at Euclid. Alex Through The Looking-Glass: How Life Reflects Numbers and Numbers Reflect Life was published in 2014 and received positive reviews. The Daily Telegraph wrote: ‚ÄúIf anything, Looking Glass is a better work than Numberland ‚Äì it feels more immediate, more relevant and more fun.‚Äù Its US title was The Grapes of Math, about which The New York Times said Bellos was: ‚Äúa charming and eloquent guide to math‚Äôs mysteries‚Ä¶There‚Äôs an interesting fact or mathematical obsessive on almost every page. And for its witty flourishes, it‚Äôs never shallow. Bellos doesn‚Äôt shrink from delving into equations, which should delight aficionados who relish those kinds of details.‚Äù Bellos presented the BBC TV series Inside Out Brazil (2003), and also authored the documentary Et Dieu cr√©a‚Ä¶le foot, about football in the Amazon rainforest, which was shown on the National Geographic Channel. His short films on the Amazon have appeared on BBC, More4 and Al Jazeera. He also appears frequently on the BBC talking about mathematics.

The Network's solutions are based on proprietary SaaS-based technology and expert-level services. The company uses the phrase \\"Protect, Detect, Correct\\" to describe how its solutions enable global enterprises and institutions manage risks posed by fraud and unethical conduct. The Network current client base includes approximately 3,400 global organizations across a wide variety of industries and includes approximately half of the Fortune 500, representing almost 27 million employees worldwide. History The Network was founded in 1982 by Ralph Childs, a former FBI Special Agent, who implemented the first 24/7 anonymous reporting system to allow employees to bring unethical and illegal activities to their employers‚Äô attention without fear of reprisal. Childs, then principal of security consulting firm Childs Associates, incorporated the new venture under the name National Business Crime Information Network, Inc., which soon became known by the shortened name, The Network. Soon thereafter, the company realized the need to make all employees more aware of organizational ethics programs and initiated a series of awareness and communications products (‚Ä≥Prevention SystemSM‚Ä≥), as well as ethics training materials to meet these requirements. NetClaim In the mid-1990s, The Network expanded its hotline reporting system to include claims reporting for worker compensation and other similar issues. The system it developed to manage claims reporting, NetClaim, remains a viable part of the company‚Äôs market mix. Incident Management In 2005, the company developed its Case Management system (now known as Incident Management), which streamlined the incident and issue management process for corporate investigators and case managers. In May 2010, an enhanced version of the software was released as a replacement to the legacy system. Product Development In 2011, the company expanded its existing ethics and compliance training offerings with interactive web-based training offerings, which cover topics such as codes of conduct, conflicts of interest, anti-corruption, discrimination and harassment, insider training, information security and ethics reporting. That same year, the company introduced an enhanced version of its platform-level Reporting & Analytics engine. In April 2012, the company released its Policy Management solution, which enables organizations to use platform-level collaboration tools to create, distribute and manage company policies, track employee attestation, and know which version of a policy was in effect at any given time. In 2013, the company introduced a companion product to the Incident Management solution, CAPA/Remediation, designed to manage investigative follow-up and remedial tasks, as well as a Compliance Management solution designed for compliance risk assessment and employee survey management. In February 2013, a research firm (GRC 20/20 Research) awarded a Technology Innovator Award to The Network for the company's Integrated GRC Suite, a SaaS-based GRC system designed to deliver seamless native integration of enterprise-level compliance data and provide visibility between incidents, cases, policies, courses, and corrective or preventative action plans. GRC 20/20's chief analyst, Michael Rasmussen, referred to the Integrated GRC Suite as the \\"Apple of GRC\\" for its \\"design and end user experience.\\" Compliance Benchmarking Annually since 2006, the company has released an annual Corporate Governance and Compliance Hotline Benchmarking Report, which provides a statistical study of fraud reporting trends across a range of industries and corporate demographics. The 2013 report revealed that incident reporting rates continued to climb and that 72 percent of participants did not notify management of an issue prior to submitting a hotline report.

Although many people have the notion that this period was marked with the fight for power between Heungseon Daewongun (Ìù•ÏÑ†ÎåÄÏõêÍµ∞, ËààÂÆ£Â§ßÈô¢Âêõ - King Gojong's father) and Queen Min (King Gojong's wife), it was rather the era of great changes relevant to modernisation after the harsh oppressive years during the \\"Regency\\" of King Gojong's father. This reform also was one of the most successful for modernising in a short period of time during Korean history. Although the reform was mostly centred on the time period after the proclamation of the Korean Empire, it includes a number of other previous events that are closely related to the reform. Early modernizations (1883‚Äì94) Phase one of the Gwangmu Reform began with the first Korean delegation to America, and opening up for modernisation. Because of recurring Chinese interventions led by Li Hongzhang (Ïù¥ÌôçÏû•,ÊùéÈ¥ªÁ´†), there was relatively less development of Chosun compared to Phase Three. The main innovator in this phase is Queen Min. *1883: March.

American minister Lucius Foote arrived to take command of the modernization of Chosun's older army units that had not started Westernizing.

The Ministry of Presswork and Publication (Î∞ïÎ¨∏Íµ≠,ÂçöÊñáÂ±Ä)was opened for the modernisation of the printing industry. *1883: August. The first edition of the Hanseong sunbo (ÌïúÏÑ±ÏàúÎ≥¥,Êº¢ÂüéÊó¨Â†±) was published on this year. This is the first newspaper to be published in Chosun. *1884: The Daedong Corporation (ÎåÄÎèôÏÉÅÌöå,Â§ßÂêåÂïÜÊúÉ), the first modern domestic corporation in Korea, was established. *1885: February. The first Royal Medical Clinic, the Gwanghyewon (Í¥ëÌòúÏó∞,Âª£ÊÉ†Èô¢) was opened with the introduction of modern medicine by Horace Newton Allen. The name changed to Jaejoongwon (Ï†úÏ§ëÏõê,ÊøüË°ÜÈô¢) a month later. *1885: May. Presbyterianism is introduced to Chosun by Horace Grant Underwood. Many other Christian pastors came to Chosun, which became the fundamental background for religious freedom and equality between Koreans. *1885: July. The Korea-Chinese Cable Treaty (Ï°∞Ï≤≠Ï†ÑÏÑ†Ï°∞ÏïΩ,ÊúùÊ∑∏ÈõªÁ∑öÊ¢ùÁ¥Ñ) is signed and enforced, leading to a telegraphic connection between Hanseong and Peking. *1885: August.

It is part of Union Council Peeran of tehsil Mansehra. The village has a population of approximately 3,000 people. It is located 10 kilometres away from Attar shisha and 6 kilometres from Sandesar, from where its road diverges from the Kaghan Highway (N15). Maira Amjad Ali graveyard History According to legend, Qutb Shah (Persian: ŸÇÿ∑ÿ® ÿ¥ÿßŸá) was a ruler of Herat and a general in the army of Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni. Historical sources attest that the Khorasan and Herat were under the rule of King Nuh III of Samanids, the seventh of the Samanid line‚Äîat the time of Seb√ºk Tigin and his older son, Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi. The governor of HerƒÅt was a noble by the name of 'Faik', who governed on behalf of King Nuh III. Faik was a powerful, but insubordinate governor of Nuh III; and had been punished by Nuh III. Faik made overtures to Bogra Khan and Ughar Khan of Khorasan. Bogra Khan answered Faik's call, came to HerƒÅt and became its master. This person, Faik, had nothing to do with any fictitious 'Qutb Shah'. No real proof exists anywhere of the actual existence of any such individual. In 994, Nuh III invited Alp Tigin to come to his aid. Alp Tigin, along with Mahmud of Ghazni, defeated Faik and annexed HerƒÅt, Nishapur and Tous. It is claimed in legend and folklore that Qutub Shah and nine of his sons accompanied and assisted Sultan Mahmud Ghazni in his early eleventh-century conquests; of what today forms parts of Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan and Northern India, who, according to tribal traditions, settled primarily in the Salt Range. Geography The village is located on a plateau wedged between the Chowki mountains on the northeast side and the Sarjool top on its southwest. A small stream runs through the base of these hills toward the nearby hamlet of Samian. The average height of the village is 4,304 feet (1311 metres) above sea level. The subsoil is mainly mixed rocky clay. It is 17 kilometres from the nearby city of Mansehra and 29 kilometres from Balakot. Demography The village's population is approximately 3,000, with the predominant religion being Islam. Ethnically, the people identify themselves with various tribes including the Awans, Gujjars, Kashmiris, Rajputs and Swatis. Suleman Khel sulemani Governance The village is part of the Union Council Peeran of District Mansehra. Educational facilities The village is served by separate primary ,middle and High schools for girls and boys. There is no privately run schools, and it also has an NGO funded school running under TCF International, constructed after the devastating 2005 earthquake. Maira Amjad Ali Mosque Religious sites The village has a large, triple storied, newly constructed Jamia mosque called the \\"Jamia Masjid Siddique-e-Akbar (R.A)\\" with a spacious hall and a tall minaret, visible from quite some distance. There is a traditional religious seminary in the mosque. The old mosque has also been converted into a separate seminary for girls. Commercial facilities The traditional parking lot (adda) is surrounded by 15 to 20 shops which provide basic amenities. It is also served by a branch of the state-run utility stores. Most of the items of daily use are brought from the nearby city of Mansehra to which it is connected by road. There is also a (Khan market) of (Sajjad Khan Awan) in (adda) of the village.

Sarah was a judge in the 2007 Chris Austin Songwriting Contest. Sarah Hawker learned about traditional Appalachian singing from her aunt Ginny Hawker, traditional Appalachian singer, and her uncle Tracy Schwarz of the New Lost City Ramblers, as well as her grandfather, Ben Hawker, beloved Primitive Baptist singer and teacher, and teller of tall tales. Along with singing and songwriting, she plays guitar, clawhammer banjo and harmonium.

(BC) Dirty Linen Magazine August/September '05 \\"The Lonesome Sisters are vocalist Sarah Hawker and Debra Clifford on vocals and guitar. If the name Hawker seems familiar, Sarah is the niece of master traditional vocalist Ginny Hawker. Sarah was also one of the recipients of the prestigious Chris Austin Songwriter's Award at Merlefest 2004. It's fascinating to trace the progress of musical talent and these two recordings, while released within a year of each other, show a tremendous development in the duo's performing style and songwriting ability. Debra Clifford and Sarah Hawker have produced two recordings of great tenderness and beauty.

Based on the G√∂ppingen G√∂ 4 side-by-side seat training glider, it had a foldaway propeller, column-mounted above the fuselage and shaft-driven by a small internal piston engine. Design and development The Carden-Baynes Auxiliary or Scud 3 of 1935 was the first motorised glider to use an engine and propeller unit which could be retracted, allowing conventional gliding after self-launching. The Hi-20 MoSe (MoSe was short for Motor-Segler or motor glider) was the first German motor glider of this kind and the first such two seater; it is not known if Hirth was familiar with the earlier aircraft when he began the Hi-20's design in 1937. The Schempp-Hirth factory at Nabern (now Kirchheim/Teck) was busy with the production of the G√∂ppingen G√∂ 4 and with the outbreak of World War II, the sole prototype was not completed until 1941. Rather than develop a new aircraft for their foldaway power plant and propeller experiments, it was decided to save on time and money by using the wings and tail of a G√∂ppingen G√∂ 4. A new, steel framed rather than wooden, fuselage was constructed with very similar length and profile to the original. The propulsion unit, when deployed, consisted of a vertical, faired column carrying a pusher propeller with its hub about 700 mm (2 ft 3 in) above the fuselage, so the tips just cleared the structure. The column was pivoted just inside the fuselage with the engine at its short lower end. Engine and propeller were connected by a shaft within the column; at its top gears turned the drive-shaft through 90¬∞ and reduced the output speed by a factor of 2.3. After a powered climb to altitude, the unit was rotated on its pivot so the propeller fitted into a dorsal slot in the fuselage and the engine lay immediately behind the cockpit bulkhead. A new 19 kW (25 hp) air-cooled four cylinder two stroke engine was developed for the Hi-20 by W. Krautter. Cooling air was moved to the engine inside the fuselage through the propeller-bearing column. The first flight was made under aero tow in October 1941. More flights were made the following year but then development stopped, as war work took priority.

Life A nephew of John Harmar the scholar, he was born at Churchdown, near Gloucester, about 1594, and was educated at Winchester College. He obtained a demyship at Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1610, at the age of 16; graduated B.A. 15 December 1614, and M. A. 18 June 1617, and took holy orders. In 1617 Harmar was appointed usher at Magdalen College School; disputes seem to have arisen between him and the head-master, and Peter Heylyn, who was then at the college, notes in his diary that Harmar was a subject of mockery. In 1626 he obtained the mastership of the free school at St. Albans. While he was there the king visited the school, and his pupils recited three orations on the occasion. He held other scholastic offices, among them the under-mastership at Westminster School, and supplicated for the degree of M.B. on 4 July 1632. In 1650 Harmar was appointed Regius Professor of Greek at Oxford: though his learning was esteemed, he was unpopular as a seeker of patronage. In September 1659 he appears to have been one of the victims of a practical joke; a mock Greek Orthodox patriarch visited the university, and he delivered a solemn Greek oration before him. This imposter was a London merchant named Kynaston, in a prank set up by William Lloyd which also took in Gilbert Ironside the Younger.Falconer Madan, Oxford Books; a bibliography of printed works relating to the University and City of Oxford or printed or published there. vol. 3, (1895), p. 93; archive.org. In 1659, also, through the intervention of Richard Cromwell, he was presented by the university to the donative rectory of Ewhurst, Hampshire. On the Restoration of 1660 he lost both his professorship and his rectory, and retired to Steventon in Berkshire, supported mainly by his wife's jointure. Harmar died at Steventon on 1 November 1670, and was buried in the churchyard there, partly, at least, at the expense of Nicholas Lloyd the dictionary-maker.

During his time in Newark, Henderson lived and worked in The Governor's House In February 1643, Henderson led a sortie from the town that successfully repulsed Major- General Thomas Ballard's force of 6,000 Parliamentarians.

Two days later, the Earl of Manchester routed Henderson's Royalist cavalry at the Battle of Winceby.

Biographical details Islam was married and had two sons and one daughter. Work Islam, a former garment worker, was president of the Ashulia and Savar chapters of the Bangladesh Garment & Industrial Workers Federation and a leader of the Bangladesh Center of Worker Solidarity, which has advocated for improved working conditions and higher wages. In 2010, the organization led protests to push for a larger increase in the minimum wage for garment workers in the Bangladesh textile industry. Islam, as well as other labor leaders, had been arrested in connection with these protests. During his arrest in 2010, he was physically tortured by officers of the National Security Intelligence. Islam had recently been working to organize workers in factories belonging to the Shanta Group, which produces clothing for multiple American companies including Tommy Hilfiger, Nike, and Ralph Lauren. He had also assisted ABC News in setting up interviews with survivors of a recent factory fire in Bangladesh. Murder The 6 April 2012 issue of the Bangali-language newspaper Amar Desh carried photograph of a man whose identity was unknown at the time and whose dead body had been found by the Tangail police. From the photo in Amar Desh, Islam's family was able to recognize him. Islam's body was found on 5 April 2012 next to a road near Ghatail, Bangladesh, sixty-one miles north of Dhaka. His body bore marks of torture. He had last been seen alive in Ashulia, a center of the garment industry near Dhaka. It is suspected that he was murdered because he was involved in seeking justice for the general worker of garment sector of Bangladesh. Islam's murder is still unsolved, but his case gained international attention from AFL-CIO and the US State Department.

He was the first to prove chemical carcinogenesis. He was the Nobel Prize Nominee in 7 nominations.Katsusaburo Yamagiwa - Nomination Database  Life  Yamagiwa was born in Ueda, Nagano, the third son of the feudal retainer of the Ueda Domain in Shinano Province. He became the adopted son-in- law of Yoshiya Yamagiwa, a physician in Katsuya, Tokyo, and took the surname Yamagiwa. He completed his MD in 1888 from Imperial University of Tokyo. He was appointed as a professor at the Medical School, Imperial University of Tokyo and published his landmark work, By≈çri S≈çron K≈çgi, in 1895. Yamagiwa did all he could for the promotion of cancer research in Japan. In 1907 Cancer Science, peer-reviewed medical journal covering research in oncology, was first issued by him. In addition, he and his colleagues found the Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research in 1908. He died in Tokyo of pneumonia in 1930 at the age of 67.  Contributions  In a series of experiments conducted in 1915, Yamagiwa and his assistant K≈çichi Ichikawa (1888 - 1948) induced squamous cell carcinomas on the ears of rabbits using coal tar, demonstrating the latter's carcinogenic properties.  Recognitions  Yamagiwa and Ichikawa shared the Japan Academy Prize in 1919 for their work. The 1926 Nobel Prize went to Johannes Andreas Grib Fibiger, for his discovery of Spiroptera carcinoma, a microbial parasite which Fibiger claimed was the cause of cancer. This \\"finding\\" was discredited by other scientists shortly thereafter. Two years later, Katsusaburo Yamagiwa successfully induced squamous cell carcinoma by painting crude coal tar on the inner surface of rabbits' ears. Yamagiwa's work has become the primary basis for this line of research. Because of this, some people consider Fibiger's Nobel Prize to be undeserved, particularly because Yamagiwa never received the prize for his work. In 1966, the former committee member Folke Henschen strongly advocated that Dr. Yamagiwa deserved the Nobel Prize, but unfortunately, it was not realized.

It was the first movie by an already significant Canadian director (McDonald) to have its world premier at the Whistler event. The category of competition this mockumentary sequel entered in was the Borsos Award for Best Canadian Feature Film. It was judged alongside five other Canadian films in this category, losing to The Whistleblower by Toronto's Larysa Kondracki. Reception Expectations were set high for Bruce McDonald when he released the second instalment of Hard Core Logo. This caused the film to receive mixed reviews, from those who compared it to the original. Following its release in 2010, it received some positive reviews, such as that of Katherine Monk, from Postmedia News. She writes that it is a film about \\"artistic inspiration, maintaining a pure creative heart and connecting with others through honest expression.\\" Hard Core Logo 2 also garnered many negative reviews, such as that of Mathew Kumar, a critic for Exclaim. He writes that this film is a documentary of all the boring parts of music-making, unlike the first film, and then he says that it is a pathetic attempt at shocking the audience. The Globe and Mail later referred to the feature as giving the audience \\"no sense of urgency, desire, or necessity\\" to continue watching. The film received a 37 percent score on the film rating site Rotten Tomatoes.

Survey & Studies for Conservation of Historical Monuments of Multan. Department of Archeology & Museums, Ministry of Culture, Government of Pakistan. Ancient Multan was the centre of a solar- worshipping sect that was based at the temple. Some of the temple's appeal was derived from the belief that the temple's Aditya idol could cure maladies. The temple was highly revered, and was an object of pilgrimage for the Hindus from the region, even during the first centuries of Islamic rule. The large number of pilgrims, enriched the coffers of the new Muslim rulers of the region, as the Hindu pilgrims were taxed and their offerings confiscated. The temple's famous Aditya idol was destroyed in the late 10th century CE by Multan's new dynasty of Ismaili rulers. The temple was noted by the medieval Arab geographer Al-Muqaddasi to have been located in the most populous part of Multan, between the city's ivory and copper-smith bazaars. History The solar sect may have been derived from the worship of Mithra, an Indo-Iranian god, whose secret cult survived the spread of Zoroastrianism in Iran, while Mitra of the Rigveda lost its importance in India after Vedic period.

Chapekar, pp 29-30 Hsuen Tsang is said to have visited the temple in 641 AD, by which time the Multan Sun Temple was the most important sun temple in ancient India. Hsuen Tsang described an idol of the Sun God made of pure gold with eyes made from large red rubies.A Religious History of Ancient India, Up to C. 1200 A.D.: Smarta, epic-Pauranika and Tantrika Hinduism, Christianity and Islam by Srirama Goyala, 1986, pp 339 Gold, silver and gems were abundantly used in its doors, pillars and shikhara. Thousands of Hindus regularly went to Multan to worship the Sun God. Hsuen Tsang is also said to have seen several devadasis (\\"dancing girls\\") in the temple, and even refers to the Hindu festival celebrated in Multan in honor of the Hindu Sun God Surya. Travelers like Hsuen Tsang, Istakhari and others, mentioned other idols in their travelogue, saying that the idols of Shiva and Buddha were also installed in the temple. Al-Biruni visited Multan in the 11th Century and left a glowing description of the temple, though it had been destroyed by the time he visited the city. =Under Islamic rule= After the conquest of Multan by the Umayyad Caliphate in the 8th century AD it was destroyed and the original gold idol was taken away. The temple was rebuilt by local population and a wooden idol was placed in place of the original idol. Under the leadership of Muhammad bin Qasim, the Sun Temple was said to have been \\"carefully protected\\" by Multan's rulers. The temple was also used to ward off Hindu retaliators, as the Muslim rulers would threaten to destroy the revered idol in case of invasion. Multan's Sun Temple was noted to have accrued the early Muslim rulers large tax revenues from Hindu pilgrims.Schimmel pg.4 By some accounts, the temple accrued 30% of the state's revenues. Offerings brought by Hindu pilgrims, which were often very valuable, were forfeited to the city's rulers who used, sold, or gave the items away. During these early centuries of Islamic rule, the temple withstood local Islamic hostilities and still attracted Hindus from far and wide even after the Ghaznavids captured the region, which showed a strong Hindu presence still remaining in the area. =Destruction= The temple was destroyed by Multan's dynasty of new Ismaili rulers in the late 10th century, who in turn built an Ismaili congregational mosque atop the site after abandoning the city's old Sunni congregational mosque which had been built by the city's early Muslim rulers. The Ismaili mosque that had been built atop the Sun Temple's ruins was then in turn destroyed in the early 11th century by Mahmud of Ghazni. The Persian scholar Al-Biruni visited the site in the 11th century and noted that it was no longer visited by Hindu pilgrims as the site had laid in ruin without being rebuilt. Multan had come under the influence of the Ismaili Shias under the leader Jalam bin Shayban By the mid 900s. Shayban was a proselytizing Da'i of the Qarmatian sect that had been dispatched to the region upon the recommendation of Fatimid Caliph Imam al-Mu'izz, to replace the city's rebellious Da'i whose views regarding Imam successor ship contrasted with those of the Fatimids. The Qarmatian sect which replaced the rebellious Da'i had been expelled from Egypt and Iraq following their defeat at the hands of the Abbasids there. Qarmatians zealots had famously sacked Mecca,Mecca's History, from Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. and outraged the Muslim world with their theft and ransom of the Kaaba's Black Stone, and desecration of the Zamzam Well with corpses during the Hajj season of 930 CE.Glass√©, Cyril. 2008.

The dead were all members of the Guardia Civil studying in the nearby traffic school on Pr√≠ncipe de Vergara. The ETA members later convicted of participation in the attack included significant figures in the group, including Antonio Troiti√±o and I√±aki de Juana Chaos. Background The \\"comando Espa√±a\\" of ETA had been responsible for 20 deaths in the previous year, these included an attack in Madrid three months earlier, which had resulted in five deaths, and another the previous month which had killed three people. ETA as a whole had been responsible for 24 deaths in 1986 prior to the attack; 18 of those had occurred in Madrid, leading to claims that the organisation was focusing on the Spanish capital because it believed that attacks there had greater influence on public opinion than attacks in the Basque region. The attack had the highest number of casualties since the El Descanso bombing, by suspected jihadists in April 1985, had killed 18 people. Targets The police convoy consisted of 70 civil guards, aged between 18 and 25, who had left a traffic school in order to head to Venta de la Rubia, on the outskirts of the Spanish capital, where police engaged in daily practice riding a motorcycle. The convoy consisted of a bus, a minibus and a Land Rover and followed the same route at the same time every day, making it easier for ETA to target it. The attack The car bomb was loaded with 35 kilos of Goma-2 explosives and significant quantities of shrapnel and was triggered by remote control by Antonio Troiti√±o, who had been waiting for the passing of the convoy at a nearby bus stop. One of ETA's most active members, Jose Ignacio de Juana Chaos, was waiting nearby in a vehicle to flee. The explosion threw the bus into the air. Four officers were killed instantly and 32 others were injured, including six civilians. A further four officers were pronounced dead shortly afterward at the nearby La Paz clinic, with a ninth dead announced at 21:30 the same day, and three others dying of their injuries later. Those injured included commuters waiting at a nearby bus stop, while cars and property in the Plaza were also damaged. Reactions The Plaza Rep√∫blica Dominicana attack occurred three weeks after the general election and one day before the newly elected parliament opened. There was also speculation that the attack was in response to the French government's decision the previous day to extradite Jos√© Iturbe, the alleged military leader of ETA, from Gabon to face trial, though this theory was challenged by the Deputy Prime Minister Alfonso Guerra, who pointed out that such an attack would have required a longer period of planning. Mayor of Madrid, Juan Barranco Gallardo, called for solidarity with the victims and their families and requested a three-minute silence at midday the same day. Arrests Ant√≥n Troiti√±o, alias 'Miguel √Ångel' and Jos√© Ignacio de Juana Chaos were apprehended on 16 January 1987, when anti-terrorist police mounted an operation against their base of operations, a flat on R√≠o Ulla Street in Madrid. Four other ETA members: Cristina Arrizabalaga, Mar√≠a Teresa Rojo, Esteban Esteban Nieto, In√©s del R√≠o Prada and Inmaculada Noble were arrested in the same operation. In 1989, Troiti√±o was convicted of 22 murders and sentenced to 2,232 years in prison However he was released from prison on 13 April 2011. In√©s del R√≠o Prada received sentences totalling 3,828 years for her participation in this and other attacks. These sentences were to run concurrently, making her eligible for release in 2008.

He was the first artist using the term cyborg, coined in the early 60s by two American scientists. Training He began his studies into the cities of Lecce, Naples, Rome and Milan. In 1959 he formed friendship with Lucio Fontana and went often to his studio; that year he also met his friend Gianni Colombo. Around the 60s he formed friendship with Silvio Ceccato and first met Roberto Sanesi and Bruno Munari, who are stroke by his innovative ideas and they convinced him to move to Milan. In the same years he started a good relationship with Pedro Fiori and Domenico Cara. Beginnings In the later years he met Giulio Carlo Argan, Carmelo Strano, Luciano Inga Pin and Pierre Restany, who esteemed his work and who invited him to participate to the 10th anniversary of Nouveau R√©alisme in 1970, in Milan. For the event Valentini realized a work in honour of Yves Klein. He made scientific and interdisciplinary studies knowing several scientists, among whom the astrophysicist Cesare Guaita and Silvio Ceccato. He collaborated with research institutes and universities, such as the University of Pavia. He associated to biology and studies of organic matter the interest for telematics, information technology, cybernetics and astrophysics. He used for the first time various techniques whose name would be today nanoart, such as in the work ‚ÄúCristalli, stomi e cellule epidermali di stilo‚Äù (1978), or in other works made with cells cultures in vitro, or in any experiments touching the boundaries of science. In his various exhibitions in Italy and abroad Giovanni Valentini follows a route where art works with microscope and telescope to reveal matter‚Äôs facets, the complexity of life and her various shapes. Valentini also used programming language to realize images showing stars, planets and astronomical phenomena's scenery. In 1964 and 1966 he showed his works in personal exhibitions at the Montenapoleone art gallery in Milan, then in 1967 at the Rizzato-Whitworth-Diagramma art gallery of Luciano Inga Pin and finally at the Italian newspaper Il Giorno art gallery. Giovanni Valentini won the San Fedele prize in 1971 and then he held an exhibition on suspended animation, with nitrogen freezers containing animals placed in suspended animation, and radars which detect visitors movement. Again in 1971 he held a personal exhibition at the Apollinaire art gallery of Guido Le Noci, in Milan, and at the Obelisco art gallery, in Rome.

After buying the ranch, the local community decided that there could be more revenue from eco-tourism. Fees now provide income to the community and help cover the cost of maintenance. Several organizations have provided funding for infrastructure and conservation including Tusk Trust, Born Free Foundation and Lewa Wildlife Conservancy. and Projects Abroad (www.projects-abroad.org) Flora and fauna The Kigio Wildlife Conservancy contains diverse habitat including short grass, Leleshwa shrub, euphorbia woodlands and riverine woodlands. Almost 100 indigenous plant species are protected in the conservancy. There are over three hundred bird species including what is said to be the world's largest population of grey-crested helmetshrikes. There are about 3,500 head of large mammals, up from about 100 head in 1996. Grazing animals include African buffalo, common eland, impala, waterbuck, Grant's gazelle, Thomson's gazelle and Grant's zebra. Other species include spotted hyena, African leopard, hippopotamus, caracal, aardvark, aardwolf, honey badger and spring hare. The endangered Rothschild's giraffe is also found here. The last giraffe in the region was killed by poachers in 1996. The management of the reserve applied to the Kenya Wildlife Service to have Rothschild's giraffe moved to the conservancy. This was granted on condition that the conservancy was fenced, which was done with funding from the European Union and the Born Free Foundation. The conservancy, bounded by the Malewa River to the east, is now enclosed by an electric fence on the three other sides. The BBC programme, Born to be Wild included an episode that covered the process of relocating the giraffes. From eight Rothschild's giraffe moved from Lake Nakuru National Park in 2002 there were almost thirty by 2012. Visitors The conservancy offers accommodation at Malewa Wildlife Lodge and Kigio Wildlife Camp, both built with traditional techniques and materials. Guests may participate in activities that have minimal impact on the environment, including guided walks, cycling and fishing. They may also take game-spotting drives in open-sided 4x4 vehicles during the day or at night. Locally-made craft works are also sold, with much of the proceed going to the community fund.

Due to this reason Sainis gradually cut adrift from Rajputs on hills and adopted farming identity even though both tribes are of proven Rajput descent.SS Gahlot, 1989;Hugh Kennedy Trevaskis, 1928 The town Banga is also named after Bangas.

Cast * Rossif Sutherland as Robert * Karine Vanasse as Daphne * Don McKellar as Phil * Nicholas Campbell as Father * Greg Calderone as Customs Officer * Gregory 'Dominic' Odjig as Winston * Marie-H√©l√®ne Fontaine as Mother * Ella Jonas Farlinger as Natalie * Jamie Lyle as Children's Counciller Plot On the verge of his thirtieth birthday, Robert (Rossif Sutherland), a wealthy Wall Street broker, grieves his latest relationship gone awry and questions a loss of meaning and purpose to his career. Disenchanted with his life, he liquidates his assets and celebrates his newfound freedom that night in a Manhattan bar where he spots the mysterious, attractive Daphne (Karine Vanasse). Under the influence of alcohol and prodded on by his older mentor Phil (Don McKellar), Robert attempts to make a pass at Daphne only to be surprised by her responsiveness. The attraction between the two grows and soon they are off to a motel for a night of impassioned love-making infused with a hefty dose of drugs and alcohol. Early the next morning, Daphne prepares to leave but hesitates when she discovers Robert‚Äôs tote bag filled with cash. She blackmails Robert into posing as her fianc√© and travelling to North Bay to visit her parents. Later that morning, Robert awakens hungover in the passenger seat of his own car, to discover Daphne's ploy. Robert reluctantly relents to playing along as they reach the border crossing. Soon the two are traversing the Canadian wilderness with Daphne at the wheel of Robert's hatchback. After a period of time, the car radiator breaks down, forcing Daphne to pull over on a deserted portion of the highway. The pair eventually wave down a passing car, whose driver agrees to take them as far as Pembroke. At a pitstop, Daphne phones home, telling her mother she is engaged to be married and arranges for her and Robert to have lunch with her parents the next day. Daphne reveals to Robert that her parents kicked her out of the house ten years ago and that she has not spoken to her father since. Their driver drops them off at a motel, where Daphne tries unsuccessfully to seduce Robert. Robert calls his mentor Phil, who claims he hired Daphne to hook up with Robert as a birthday present. The next morning Robert confronts Daphne who admits Phil had indeed hired her to sleep with Robert. On the bus to North Bay, Daphne apologizes to Robert, telling him she will return the money after they meet her parents. Daphne reveals her real name is Marie. Upon reaching the bus terminal, Daphne/Marie returns the valise of cash to Robert, who, afraid he has been duped by Daphne/Marie, abruptly announces he is heading back to New York City. Daphne/Marie goes alone to her parents‚Äô house while Robert realizes Daphne/Marie had kept her promise and his money had been left untouched. Robert shows up late at the door and plays the part of Daphne‚Äôs fianc√©. Later, Daphne/Marie reveals she has a daughter, Natalie, and she and Robert go to visit Natalie at Sunday school. Daphne/Marie encounters Natalie but leaves shortly thereafter to catch a bus back to Manhattan. At the bus terminal, Daphne/Marie and Robert prepare to buy their tickets when Daphne‚Äôs father walks in accompanied by her mother and Natalie. Her father reveals her mother asked him to come to the bus terminal after Natalie called them. Daphne/Marie reconciles with her father and Natalie urges her mother Daphne/Marie to stay. Daphne/Marie and Robert agree. The movie closes with a reunited Daphne/Marie, Natalie, and Robert standing outside the bus terminal, gazing at a flock of geese soaring across the sky. Daphne/Marie and Robert look deeply into each other's eyes and smile. Reception =Critical response= Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail, gave the film two stars out of four, stating, \\"the plot collapses into a fairy-tale ending that is offered as an odd remedy for the characters‚Äô facile defeatism.\\" Peter Howell of the Toronto Star also criticized the plot, stating, \\"A miscast and mismatched Rossif Sutherland and Karine Vanasse stretch credulity at every quirk-filled turn as they follow a bag of loot and chase family problems on the long trek from New York to Ontario's 'Gateway to the North.' \\" Howell further remarked: \\"The eye-rolling script is the main problem.\\" To Toronto Star critic Linda Barnard, the film offered little to write home about. Barnard gave the film one and a half stars out of four, writing, \\"Even the sex is dull in I‚Äôm Yours, ...

It was established at the end of 2012 by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Max Planck Society, and Wellcome Trust, following a workshop held in 2010 at the Janelia Farm Research Campus. Together, these organizations provided the initial funding to support the business and publishing operations. In 2016, the organizations committed USD$26 million to continue publication of the journal. The current editor-in- chief is Michael Eisen (University of California, Berkeley). Editorial decisions are made largely by senior editors and members of the board of reviewing editors, all of whom are active scientists working in fields ranging from human genetics and neuroscience to biophysics and epidemiology. Business model The journal asks for an article processing charge of USD$2,500 for papers accepted for publication. Authors with insufficient funding are eligible for a fee waiver. Abstracting and indexing The journal is abstracted and indexed in Medline, BIOSIS Previews, Chemical Abstracts Service, Science Citation Index Expanded, and Scopus. According to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2018 impact factor of 7.080. The journal opposes the over-reliance on the impact factor by the scientific community. In an interview, Howard Hughes Medical Institute then President Robert Tjian reflected on eLife and noted, \\"The other big thing is, we want to kill the journal impact factor. We tried to prevent people who do the impact factors from giving us one. They gave us one anyway a year earlier than they should have. Don't ask me what it is because I truly don't want to know and don't care.\\" eLife Podcast The eLife Podcast is produced by BBC Radio presenter and University of Cambridge consultant virologist Chris Smith of The Naked Scientists. eLife digests Most research articles published in the journal include an \\"eLife digest\\", a non-technical summary of the research findings aimed at a lay audience. Since December 2014, the journal has been sharing a selection of the digests on the blog publishing platform Medium. eLife also publishes commentary articles called \\"Insights\\", which are also written in plainer terms than the research article, but focus more on the context of the research. Trying innovative rules of review Schekman criticized Nature, Science and Cell as \\"luxury journals\\" in 2013, comparing their low acceptance levels and high impact factors with high-end \\"fashion designers\\" who deliberately inflated demand for their brand due to scarcity. During the peer review process, eLife encourages the reviewers to discuss a manuscript and agree on a common recommendation. However, the acceptance rate of eLife was 15.4% in 2015, which is similar to the acceptance rates of Nature and Science - both below 10%. In June 2018, eLife announced that it would try innovative peer review model (for some 300 submissions) where the editorial decision to send a manuscript out for review is tantamount to offering publication to that manuscript, thereby putting the authors in control of publication after editorial screening has been passed.

In 1989, a judge in Miami began to take a hands-on approach to drug addicts, ordering them into treatment, rather than perpetuating the revolving door of court and prison. The result was creation of drug court, a diversion program. That same concept began to be applied to difficult situations where legal, social and human problems mesh. There were over 2,800 problem-solving courts in 2008, intended to provide a method of resolving the problem in order to reduce recidivism.  Efforts  Judith Kaye was Chief Judge of New York from 1993‚Äì2008 where she was most responsible for implementing court reform utilizing problem-solving courts in her state, one of the first in the nation. She also co-founded the Center for Court Innovation, a non-profit think tank headquartered in New York that helps courts and criminal justice agencies decrease crime, provide aid to victims and increase the public's confidence in the justice system. Center for Court Innovation researchers explored whether problem-solving justice always requires a specialized court or if core principles and practices from these specialized courts are transferable to conventional courts. After interviewing judges, attorneys and representatives from probation departments and service providers, researchers concluded that a number of principles‚Äîsuch as judicial monitoring and linking offenders to services‚Äîcould be transferable. The study, conducted in cooperation with the Collaborative Justice Courts Advisory Committee of the Judicial Council of California, was the first of its kind in the country. In 2005, The New Press published Good Courts: The Case for Problem-Solving Justice. The first book to describe the problem-solving court movement in detail, Good Courts features profiles of Center demonstration projects. The book is being used in law schools and public policy schools, due in part to a law school course on problem-solving justice that the Center piloted at Fordham Law School. The National Association of Drug Court Professionals had more than 25,000 members working in 2,663 drug courts and 1,219 other problem-solving courts as of late 2011. Their annual conference offers education and training from experts for problem-solving professionals world-wide. Both problem-solving courts and the use of therapeutic jurisprudence greatly improved the outcomes of most cases. Programs have been established for teen court, DWI court, re-entry court Community court, Domestic violence court, Sex offense court, mental health court, and veterans' court.  Principles  According to the Center for Court Innovation, there are six principles required for problem-solving courts to be effective. There must be better information available to the staff through training, and comprehensive defendant information for justice officials. Community engagement with the public will encourage cooperation of witnesses, jurors, & community watch groups, and foster trust. Collaboration between legal officials (judges/prosecutors/attorneys/probation officers), social service providers, victim groups and schools will keep everyone focused on the goal. Individualized Justice links offenders to the services they need and provides services for victims to aid in their recovery. Offenders must be held accountable with compliance monitoring and consequences for non-compliance. Outcomes need to be analyzed for cost versus benefit, and to provide continuous improvement of the process.  Differences  Problem-solving courts look just like traditional courts, but defendants are referred to as \\"clients\\" and the judge has extensive knowledge about the client and talks with them directly. A client placed in a treatment program is monitored by the judge for months or years, and will return to court periodically to assess progress and/or problems. The judge can order the client to serve jail time as a punishment while in a treatment program, and the judge decides when the client is to be released from the program.  Criticism  A 2005 article in the New York Times noted that because judges have total discretion, the results can be inconsistent. When that situation existed in the criminal justice system, mandatory sentencing guidelines were instituted. Legal scholars have warned that judges may also force their values upon defendants from different cultures. Those critical of the system say many treatment programs are unnecessarily harsh, and any deviation from the rules is punished. Some public defenders have criticized the use of problem-solving courts because accused persons who accept intervention are implicitly treated as guilty; the courts do not allow an accused person to receive a determination of innocence or guilt. New York Supreme Court Judge James A. Yates has characterized their use as a trend toward \\"an inquisitorial system of justice\\". Judges in problem-solving courts need other skills beyond a knowledge of the law; they also must sometimes function as a social worker, therapist, and accountant. Law schools have only recently begun to provide courses on problem-solving justice, and New York Judge Fern Fisher commented that not all judges have the patience and attitude necessary to be effective.  Federal guidance  The Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) is the branch of the U.S. Department of Justice tasked with proving the concept and providing guidelines to state court systems that seek to implement a program. The BJA identified ten projects and provided funding to demonstrate the theories in practice and document their results.

History  There have been previous attempts to increase the availability of free and up- to-date scientific research. In 2004, there were reports in British media of a \\"revolution in academic publishing\\" which would make research freely available online but many scientists continued to publish their work in the traditional big name journals like Nature. The barriers to free access for recent scientific research became a hot topic in 2012, after a blog post by mathematician Timothy Gowers went viral in January. According to the Financial Times, the movement was named by Dennis Johnson of Melville House Publishing, though scientist Mike Taylor has suggested the name came from The Economist. =Research Works Act= In December 2011 the Research Works Act was proposed in the US Congress to restrict open access to research funded by the US federal government. This followed other similar proposed measures such as the Fair Copyright in Research Works Act. These attempts to limit free access to such material are controversial and have provoked lobbying for and against by numerous interested parties such as the Association of American Publishers and the American Library Association. =The Cost of Knowledge= In January 2012, Cambridge mathematician, Timothy Gowers, started a boycott of journals published by Elsevier. In part this was a reaction to their support for the Research Works Act. In response to an angry blog post by Gowers, the website The Cost of Knowledge was launched by a sympathetic reader. An online petition called The Cost of Knowledge was set up by fellow mathematician Tyler Neylon, to gather support for the boycott. By early April 2012, it had been signed by over eight thousand academics. As of mid-June 2012, the number of signatories exceeded 12,000. = Access2Research = A normalized heatmap of per-capita signatures to the Access2Research petition by U.S. state. Highest support from Massachusetts (red), lowest from Mississippi (white). In May 2012, a group of open-access activists formed the Access2Research initiative that went on to launch a petition to the White House to \\"require free access over the Internet to journal articles arising from taxpayer-funded research\\". The petition was signed by over 25,000 people within two weeks, which entitled it to an official response from the White House.US open-access petition hits 25,000 signatures in two weeks - Research Information, accessed 7 June 2012 (WebCite archive) Open access Since about 2000, open access journals, which do not charge online readers, have been alternatives to the traditional journals. Successful publishers of these include BioMed Central which publishes over 200 journals, and the Public Library of Science, which publishes seven open access journals including PLoS ONE. As part of the Academic Spring, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Max Planck Society and Wellcome Trust announced in April 2012 the establishment of eLife, which started publishing in October 2012. Commentary and reactions Mike Taylor has argued that the Academic Spring may have some unexpected results beyond the obvious benefits. Referring to work by the biophysicist Cameron Neylon, he says that, because modern science is now more dependent on well-functioning networks than individuals, making information freely available may help computer-based analyses to provide opportunities for major scientific breakthroughs. Government and university officials have welcomed the prospect of saving on subscriptions which have been rising in cost, while universities' budgets have been shrinking. Mark Walport, the director of Wellcome Trust, has indicated that science sponsors do not mind having to fund publication in addition to the research. Not everyone has been supportive of the movement, with scientific publisher Kent Anderson calling it \\"shallow rhetoric aimed at the wrong target.\\" See also * Sci-Hub References Category:21st-century social movements Category:Open access (publishing) Category:Open science ","title":"Academic Spring"},{"id":"35438284","text":"The Maricopa Police Department is the agency responsible for law enforcement within the City of Maricopa, California.

The school was re-launched on 1 September 2016 as Radnor House Sevenoaks, a co- educational independent school for boys and girls aged 2.5-18. It is a member of the ISA and IAPS. History The five eras of the Combe Bank estate: 18th century, Campbell family ‚Äì Baron Sundridge‚Äôs seat 19th century, Cardinal Manning and William Spottiswoode The Mond era The Order, and school to date World Wars, evacuation and recuperation The Combe Bank estate has been through a number of ownerships, as many an estate. The grade 1 palladian House by Roger Morris, was built for Col John Campbell and modelled on the Argyll family seat of Inverary. It became in the early 19th century the boyhood home of Henry, later Cardinal, Manning, and later of William Spottiswoode, the King‚Äôs printer. 1907 saw the estate purchased by Ludwig Mond of the British chemical engineering giant ICI. The difficult economic climate of the 1920s saw the 518 acres of the estate sold in seventeen lots sold in three tranches. For the founding of a convent and school the House and grounds were purchased by the Society of the Holy Child Jesus. In the World Wars Combe Bank provided convalescence for the wounded, latterly under the British Red Cross and St John of Jerusalem; the school having evacuated first to Torquay and latterly to Coughton Court in Warwickshire. Combe Bank a convent boarding and day school from the 1920s was re-founded in 1973 as an independent girls‚Äô day school. Science, religion and learning are recurring themes in the history of Combe Bank. As a Fellow of the Royal Society William Spottiswoode a mathematician, undertook research of light, publishing in 1874, ‚ÄúThe Polarisation of light‚Äù, and ‚ÄúLecture on Electrical discharge‚Äù in 1881. Spottiswoode later becoming President of the Royal Society. Among those who visited Combe Bank at this time were literary figures such as Oscar Wilde and Matthew Arnold; and scientists T H Huxley, Charles Darwin and Michael Faraday. Each of the eras in the estate‚Äôs history has seen extension and remodelling of the property. Significant among which must rank the stable block of 1809, becoming part used in the 1900s as garaging for the motor vehicles of the Monds as keen ‚Äòautomobilists‚Äô, and later as laboratories for Robert Mond in his work on carbonyls. Later as St Anthony‚Äôs, the stables provided accommodation for the Order. In the House, the work by Walter Crane of the Arts and Crafts movement in ‚ÄòThe Saloon‚Äô in the 1880s can be seen, and that of Walter Cave, President of the Royal Society of British Architects effecting a design by Adam for the ‚ÄòAdam Room‚Äô ceiling again in the 1900s. A major extension to the north added ‚ÄòThe Long Gallery‚Äô giving the Mond family a ballroom and space for amateur theatricals. Wartime needs saw the creation of 9 wards providing 73 recuperation beds. The Order‚Äôs major extension was completed in 1931 and provided a dining room, hall, and classrooms above. The Order made the Long Gallery their chapel, a space which today serves as the Sixth Form Common Room. Subsequent developments have included a gym, swimming pool, sports hall, STEM Centre and Performing Arts theatre. Curriculum The 2015 ISI report scored the school as ‚ÄòExcellent‚Äô (highest grading, equivalent to the Ofsted ‚ÄòOutstanding‚Äô) for the areas linked to their teaching and learning, achievement, pastoral care and personal development. . The curriculum in the Prep is rich, engaging and hugely varied with pupils studying ICT, Performing/Visual Arts and Outdoor Adventurous Education alongside the more traditional subjects such as English, Maths, Geography, History and Science. In the Senior School pupils study a wide-ranging curriculum which places equal value on traditional subjects whilst also preparing pupils to flourish in a rapidly evolving world. Activities Radnor House Sevenoaks offers an extremely varied co-curricular programme including Art & Design, Young Enterprise, Duke of Edinburgh Award, Science, Debating, Literature, Performimng Arts & Music and Sports. Radnor House Sevenoaks also aims to introduce children to the benefits of charitable giving from an early age. The school supports local and national charities and also works with Project Le Monde to support the Radnor House School in Uganda.

Much of the film was shot in France (mainly in Paris and Lyon), with some scenes shot in Prague. A few scenes were shot in India also.  Plot  Story starts with a narration of Paris and its symbolization of love. Marie Elise is Narrator who says you can be in love but never find love/lover here in Paris. A Parisian reads a script of a play as follows. Ishkq is the name of girl who is born in Paris (Preity Zinta) who doesn't believe in deep love but all she wants is no commitments in relationship and wants to be free and is a Photographer and play writer. Akash Kapoor, Cash with an A (Rhehan Malliek) and his friend Karan who comes to see him off are seen running on the railway station because they might miss last train to Paris when narrator says that Akash doesn't know that he will regret if he doesn't leave this train. Who knows if he leaves what will he miss in his life and Akash gets a work call while they wait for bidding goodbye. Karan says please come to my marriage, Akash says my kiss and love to Amelia(friends fianc√©), Karan again says please do come for his marriage but Akash is not sure. Akash enters the train and scrolls his mobile and sees a girl keeping her luggage on top and says in Hindi. The girl is Ishkq and turns around to reply to Akash. They flirt around and have wine in the train to Paris, Ishkq says that she was roaming in Rome for weekend because she loves being served by men and Italian waiters to be specific and guesses if Akash is Gujarati. Akash introduces and says he is from Delhi, Funjabi (Punjabi) and moved to London a year ago, he missed his flight to London so catching this train to Paris and next day morning to London. While leaving Akash asks for spending time with him but Ishkq denies, but she later agrees since he is also not interested in commitment and will never meet again or ask address, number or email id. Akash gives her a rose and Ishkq asks him to meet at 7:55pm sharp at Eiffel tower entrance. Ishkq surprises Akash by showing him the Eiffel tower fills with lights and she narrates how she met an Italian waiter and fell in love at first sight in Rome, but he is weak and started crying. She used to go every morning his cafe for breakfast. When they roam around they see couple kissing but he never kisses her, she hints that after hot kisses cold gelato is good. He gets her gelato but charges her 4 euros. Akash teases her that even her love will be charged by this Italian waiter and her love for being served by men. Seems that he is an agent working at London and lives on commission like the hero of movie Jery Mcquire played by Tom Cruise. Akash falls in love with her eyes and says anyone will forget if they see her eyes filled with love but again teases her last bf ‚Äì Italian waiter. It was love in air or Paris's magic, both wanted the night to be beautiful. Chunky Pandey stops them running around, says he has everything like antiques in the world and gives him a fun dice and they go to disc have drinks and dance. At midnight, they walk on streets and Ishkq says about her school time boyfriend and say pickup lines to each other. They also share evil break up lines and go for dinner where a dance girl approached Akash and asks them to visit next day. But she seems to read their mind and tells Ishkq will get married in few months but Ishkq never believes and leaves the restaurant but the physic lady says she will find her father soon. They throw dice and movie comes up and it's too late but they plan to make their own and enact few scenes. They go to park and Akash confesses that he never fell in love or shed a tear for anyone. Ishkq reveals that he had a snake charmer type boyfriend and she cried over him, because he said that she will never be happy and will be sad and lonely. Akash cried only when his parent divorced but his parents were happy that his tears were never seen. Ishkq says she fears loneliness and she will be left alone and not able to make others happy. Akash says the world is scared about this. Their loneliness spoke volumes and made them friends. It was next morning, they had coffee and Ishkq said she didn't like goodbye so asks Akash to leave first but asks him to wait for another surprise. They both agree they had the best night ever. Akash waits till he gets late and leaves. Next moment Ishkq arrives in the caf√© with a gift but since he left she also leaves thinking they will never meet. There was an unconnected and unknown bonding between the two which both didn't realize. But could they forget one evening in Paris? The foreigner has read the first part of the play and leaves the dressing room but thinks the story's staring would be a part of someone's life. The foreigner is none other than Ishkq mother, Ishkq Marie Elise. Assistant says Deborah is here and her mother says she is not yet finished with the script. Both their lives are back to normal and they forget that beautiful night, time didn't stop. Akash used to smile thinking about it sometimes. Akash gets a late-night message for Karan's wedding at Paris and says to Susan that Karan is irritating since Akash doesn't wants to come for Karan's wedding as he doesn't believe in marriage, Susan explains then Akash should not expect Karan to speak for rest of life. Akash searches for Ishkq and goes in Paris. There they go together to Karan wedding and Akash realized his love for Ishkq and takes her all around and she confesses that the beautiful portrait of her mom is drawn by her dad the amazing artists according to Akash. He proposes her but she refuses him saying he is not her saviour from loneliness and insecurity. They part ways never to meet each other. Ishkq‚Äô s mom realizes her feelings and calls Akash to her home where Akash tells that her daughter is afraid of any serious relationship because of the split between her parents and feels insecure. Soon her mother realized and tells her that her parents Ranveer and Marie decided to part happily because of their careers and all these years Ishkq misunderstood that her dad left her. Akash leaves her a card with apologies and that he will leave for London on next morning 8am train and will taste the laksa from the station restaurants. Ishkq is seen running towards him and confessing her love to him and that if he leaves she will be alone again. He proposes to her again and hug and cry.

Soundtrack  Music director duo Sajid-Wajid composed the songs for Ishkq in Paris. The soundtrack release date was announced on 15 September via Zinta's Twitter account. The songs are penned by Jalees Sherwani, Prasoon Joshi, Kumaar, Kausar Munir, Sophie Choudry and Priya Panchal.  Reception  = Box office performance = The film, collecting 4.2 million Rupees with an occupancy of \\"just 5 to 10 percent in multiplexes across the country\\". Comparatively, the new release that took the top place, Fast & Furious 6, collected 60 million Rupees on its first day. Despite being its opening weekend's second highest-grossing Hindi film, and third highest-grossing overall according to the International Business Times, the film \\"opened on such a bad note that it would require some miracle to come out with a decent number during the weekend\\", and in fact Ishkq in Paris only managed to collect a little over 10 million Rupees over the three-day period, and has been labeled a disaster. Internationally, the film was released simultaneously on 15 screens in the United Kingdom and 8 screens in the United States where it also received a tepid response, garnering merely ¬£11,057 and $6,732 respectively during the opening weekend, far less than the lower-profile Punjabi-language film Jatts in Golmaal, which opened on the same day. All-in- all, in its first week, Ishkq in Paris barely crossed the 20 million Rupee mark worldwide. = Critical response = Writing for Sify, Sonia Chopra gave the film an extremely positive review, praising the entirety of the cast, the cinematography and the dialogues and labelling it \\"great\\" and \\"irresistible, despite its flaws\\". Rachit Gupta of Filmfare gave the film 3/5 stars but did not have many positive things to say, calling the film a \\"flaky and uninteresting love story\\". Divya Solgama gave the film 2.25/5 stars on MoviezAdda, calling the film decent \\"overall\\", praising Preity Zinta's performance and criticizing the weak, dull screenplay. Similarly, in The Times of India, Meena Iyer gave 2.5/5 stars, stating \\"the actress is good but there ends the show\\", while Gaurav Malani called the film not \\"bad\\", but \\"boring\\", which to him was worse. In Bollywood Hungama, Taran Adarsh gave it the same rating, praising the chemistry between the two leads as well as the visuals, but criticizing the screenplay, concluding that Ishkq in Paris was \\"decent fare\\". Writing for India Today, Vinayak Chakravorty found that despite similarities with other films, it managed to find some originality and that Isabelle Adjani's performance was impressive, but was disappointed by the direction, the lack of chemistry between the leads, Rhehan Malliek's lack of screen presence, the fact that Preity Zinta's performance is similar to many other roles she's done before and deemed the script \\"bad\\". while similarly in Mint, Nandini Ramnath concluded that \\"if the movie works at all\\", it was because of the short runtime and Preity Zinta's \\"contagious joy at being the cynosure of attention\\". In The Asian Age, Suparna Sharma commended Zinta for producing the film herself and appreciated the short runtime but also found the story to be \\"wispy thin\\", Malliek to have \\"no personality\\" and Adjani to be \\"wasted\\" Raja Sen for Rediff.com has given 1/5 stars and says Ishkq in Paris is a bad film brought further down by a bunch of Bollywood cliches and a fading Preity Zinta, which is the same rating given by Mayank Shekhar in the Daily Bhaskar, who goes on to call the lead characters \\"uninteresting\\" and lament the state of Preity Zinta's career. Strangely enough, Shekhar incorrectly claims that Zinta plays two roles in the film, that of Ishkq and Ishkq's mother. in.com gave the film a poor review too, criticizing the weak screenplay and Preity's performance. In a special \\"Twitter review\\" for IBN, Shomini Sen deemed that though \\"Preity Zinta tries hard [...], except for some amazing shots of Paris [the film] has nothing much to offer.\\", while in another, more traditional review, Rajeev Masand called the film \\"misguided\\" and \\"overwrought\\", in addition to finding Rhehan Malliek \\"as expressive as a slab of granite\\". In Koimoi, Mohar Basu gave the film 2/5 stars, praising the editing but criticizing the screenplay and the lack of chemistry between the leads. while India TV News felt that Preity Zinta's screen presence is the only reason to watch the film despite the \\"decent\\" cinematography and \\"crisp\\" editing, as Rhehan Malliek is \\"unconvincing\\" and the music \\"unmemorable\\". Teena Elizabeth Chacko, writing in Book My Show, found the cinematography \\"excellent\\" as well as the narration by Isabelle Adjani, deemed the performances by Zinta and Malliek to be decent and the music average, but found fault with the multitude of clich√©s, the cheesy dialogues and the numerous illogical moments, giving the film 1.5/5 stars and stating that one could \\"definitely afford to miss it\\", while in The Indian Express, Shubhra Gupta gave it 2/5 stars, lamenting that it was filled with \\"all the clich√©s that you can think of\\". Glam Sham's Enkayaar criticized the screenplay, as did Shubha Shetty-Saha in Mid Day, who went on to call Adjani \\"wasted\\", Malliek \\"flat\\" and felt that Preity Zinta looked desperate to recapture her lost success, deeming the film \\"disappointing\\". In the Hindustan Times, Sarit Ray thought the film felt dated though he did enjoy the cinematography and in The Hindu, Sudhish Kamath gave the film one of its worst reviews, calling the writing \\"weak\\" and the actors \\"awful\\", warning potential viewers that going to see the film might leave them \\"feeling suicidal\\". For the Mumbai Mirror, Karan Anshuman thought the movie was \\"without heart\\", the actors had no chemistry and felt sorry for the state of Preity Zinta's career, encouraging her to \\"be bold\\" and \\"change the act\\", similarly in Daily News and Analysis, Tushar Joshi felt that the actress seemed \\"in a constant need for approval\\", advising only her die-hard fans to go watch the film. The Deccan Herald, Shilpa Jamkhandikar called the film \\"mediocre\\", a \\"farce of a film\\" and Preity Zinta \\"a shadow of her past [self]\\", while Khalid Mohamed wrote in the Deccan Chronicle that the screenplay was \\"thinner than crepe\\". For First Post, Deepanjana Pal deemed the film completely illogical, in Business of Cinema, Udita Jhunjhunwala claimed that despite its short runtime \\"Ishkq in Paris feels like a nine-hour flight, with jet lag\\" and Box Office India thought the cinematography was \\"outstanding\\", Zinta's performance was \\"noteworthy\\" and the background music \\"superb\\", but concluded that director Prem Raj \\"impresses a little but disappoints a lot\\", predicting a flop. For The New Indian Express, Nandini Krishnan called Preity Zinta \\"irritating\\" and the film \\"an insult to cinema, Paris, love and Isabelle Adjani\\" and in the Pakistani The Friday Times, Nandini Krishnan was \\"appalled\\" by the film, calling it \\"disastrous\\" and making fun of \\"the almost 40-year-old Zinta [...] trying to pass off as the still-beautiful Adjani's daughter\\", saying it \\"gave [her her] first laugh of the film\\". Similarly in Outlook, Namrata Joshi was saddened by Zinta's plastic surgery-altered looks, thought she lacked chemistry with her co-star and called the narration tedious.
