Multifocal plane microscopy (MUM) or Multiplane microscopy or Biplane microscopy is a form of light microscopy that allows the tracking of the 3D dynamics in live cells at high temporal and spatial resolution by simultaneously imaging different focal planes within the specimen. In this methodology, the light collected from the sample by an infinity-corrected objective lens is split into two paths. In each path the split light is focused onto a detector which is placed at a specific calibrated distance from the tube lens. In this way, each detector images a distinct plane within the sample. The first developed MUM setup was capable of imaging two distinct planes within the sample. However, the setup can be modified to image more than two planes by further splitting the light in each light path and focusing it onto detectors placed at specific calibrated distances. Another technique called multifocus microscopy (MFM) uses diffractive Fourier optics to image up to 25 focal planes. Presently, MUM setups are implemented that can image up to four distinct planes. Introduction Fluorescence microscopy of live cells represents a major tool in the study of trafficking events. The conventional microscope design is well adapted to image fast cellular dynamics in two dimensions, i.e., in the plane of focus. However, cells are three-dimensional objects and intracellular trafficking pathways are typically not constrained to one focal plane. If the dynamics are not constrained to one focal plane, the conventional single plane microscopy technology is inadequate for detailed studies of fast intracellular dynamics in three dimensions. Classical approaches based on changing the focal plane are often not effective in such situations since the focusing devices are relatively slow in comparison to many of the intracellular dynamics. In addition, the focal plane may frequently be at the wrong place at the wrong time, thereby missing important aspects of the dynamic events. =Implementation= MUM can be implemented in any standard light microscope. An example implementation in a Zeiss microscope is as follows. A Zeiss dual- video adaptor is first attached to the side port of a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope. Two Zeiss dual-video adaptors are then concatenated by attaching each of them to the output ports of the first Zeiss video adaptor. To each of the concatenated video adaptor, a high resolution CCD camera is attached by using C-mount/spacer rings and a custom-machined camera coupling adaptor. The spacing between the output port of the video adaptor and the camera is different for each camera, which results in the cameras imaging distinct focal planes. It is worth mentioning that there are many ways to implement MUM. The mentioned implementation offers several advantages such as flexibility, ease of installation and maintenance, and adjustability for different configurations. Additionally, for a number of applications it is important to be able to acquire images in different colors at different exposure times. For example, to visualize exocytosis in TIRFM, very fast acquisition is necessary. However, to image a fluorescently labeled stationary organelle in the cell, low excitation is necessary to avoid photobleaching and as a result the acquisition has to be relatively slow. In this regard, the above implementation offers great flexibility, since different cameras can be used to acquire images in different channels. 3D super-resolution imaging and single molecule tracking using MUM A comparison of the depth discrimination of MUM with conventional single plane microscopy. Modern microscopy techniques have generated significant interest in studying cellular processes at the single molecule level. Single molecule experiments overcome averaging effects and therefore provide information that is not accessible using conventional bulk studies. However, the 3D localization and tracking of single molecules poses several challenges. In addition to whether or not images of the single molecule can be captured while it undergoes potentially highly complex 3D dynamics, the question arises whether or not the 3D location of the single molecule can be determined and how accurately this can be done. A major obstacle to high accuracy 3D location estimation is the poor depth discrimination of a standard microscope. Even with a high numerical aperture objective, the image of a point source in a conventional microscope does not change appreciably if the point source is moved several hundred nanometers from its focus position. This makes it extraordinarily difficult to determine the axial, i.e., z position, of the point source with a conventional microscope. More generally, quantitative single molecule microscopy for 3D samples poses the identical problem whether the application is localization/tracking or super-resolution microscopy such as PALM, STORM, FPALM, dSTORM for 3D applications, i.e. the determination of the location of a single molecule in three dimensions. MUM offers several advantages. In MUM, images of the point source are simultaneously acquired at different focus levels. These images give additional information that can be used to constrain the z position of the point source. This constraining information largely overcomes the depth discrimination problem near the focus. The 3D localization measure provides a quantitative measure of how accurately the location of the point source can be determined. A small numerical value of the 3D localization measure implies very high accuracy in determining the location, while a large numerical value of the 3D localization measure implies very poor accuracy in determining the location. For a conventional microscope when the point source is close to the plane of focus, e.g., z0 <= 250 nm, the 3D localization measure predicts very poor accuracy in estimating the z position. Thus, in a conventional microscope, it is problematic to carry out 3D tracking when the point source is close to the plane of focus. On the other hand, for a two plane MUM setup the 3D localization measure predicts consistently better accuracy than a conventional microscope for a range of z-values, especially when the point source is close to the plane of focus. An immediate implication of this result is that the z-location of the point source can be determined with relatively the same level of accuracy for a range of z-values, which is favorable for 3D single particle tracking. Dual objective multifocal plane microscopy (dMUM) Dual objective multifocal plane microscope (dMUM). In single particle imaging applications, the number of photons detected from the fluorescent label plays a crucial role in the quantitative analysis of the acquired data. Currently, particle tracking experiments are typically carried out on either an inverted or an upright microscope, in which a single objective lens illuminates the sample and also collects the fluorescence signal from it. Note that although fluorescence emission from the sample occurs in all directions (i.e., above and below the sample), the use of a single objective lens in these microscope configurations results in collecting light from only one side of the sample. Even if a high numerical aperture objective lens is used, not all photons emitted at one side of the sample can be collected due to the finite collection angle of the objective lens. Thus even under the best imaging conditions conventional microscopes collect only a fraction of the photons emitted from the sample. To address this problem, a microscope configuration can be used that uses two opposing objective lenses, where one of the objectives is in an inverted position and the other objective is in an upright position. This configuration is called dual objective multifocal plane microscopy (dMUM).

It was originally open for just ten months between 1849 and 1850, and did not reopen until 1861. It then served as the frontier between the Midland Railway to the south and the London and North Western Railway to the North, with trains from each railway terminating at the station. Through trains did not begin until the two companies were merged in 1923. The station closed in 1954. The village's Community Centre is now on the site of the former station. History Ingleton station opened on 31 July 1849 as a temporary northern terminus of the \\"Little\\" North Western Railway (NWR), who were authorised to build a line from Skipton to Tebay. However, the company ran into financial difficulty and decided to concentrate on the less expensive construction of a branch line to Lancaster, and on completion of that branch, the short section between and Ingleton was closed only ten months after opening, on 1 June 1850.Western, Robert (1990), The Ingleton Branch, Oakwood Press, Oxford, , p.10 A complex sequence of negotiations over the building of line north of Ingleton followed. A number of railway companies were interested in the line as part of a route from London to Scotland; the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) already had such a route and were opposed to their competitors gaining one. Eventually it was agreed that the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway (L&CR;) would build the Ingleton Branch Line from the existing Ingleton Station to .Western (1990), pp.17‚Äì22 By the time the branch was completed in 1861, the L&CR; was operated by the LNWR, and the NWR was operated by the rival Midland Railway (MR), and the LNWR did everything in its power to frustrate the MR's ambition of using the new line as a main route to Scotland. Thus the LNWR had its own station at the other end of Ingleton Viaduct. The Ingleton Branch, and the LNWR station, opened on 16 September 1861. The MR reopened the original Ingleton station two weeks later on 1 October 1861, but refused to let LNWR trains use it.Western (1990), p.27 Passengers had to walk nearly a mile (1¬Ω km) between the two Ingleton stations, descending into the valley below and climbing up the other side, where they often had a long wait as the companies did not cooperate over timetabling either.Western (1990), p.29 By 1862, the MR agreed to allow LNWR trains to terminate at the Midland station, but both Ingleton stations remained open and connections were not timetabled.Western (1990), p.37 The presence of the Midland station played a major role in the success of the Ingleton Waterfalls Trail which opened in 1885 and attracted visitors from Bradford, Manchester and Leeds.Ingleton Waterfalls Trail: History. Retrieved 16 July 2012 In 1923, the LNWR and MR were merged into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. The LNWR station closed and, for the first time, passengers could travel through Ingleton without changing trains.Western (1990), pp.48 & 56 The site of the former LNWR station was host to three LMS caravans in 1934 and 1935, four from 1936 to 1938 and finally two caravans in 1939. On 30 January 1954, the station closed along with all passenger services on the line. The station continued to be used for goods until 1965, and the tracks were lifted in 1967.Western (1990), pp.68‚Äì69 The station was demolished and the site is now occupied by Ingleton Community Centre and the village's main car park. Ingleton Viaduct Ingleton Viaduct A viaduct of 11 arches each wide, long with a maximum height of crosses the valley of the River Greta. The foundations of this had been laid in 1849 by the NWR, but it was left to the L&CR; to build it from late 1858 to 18 May 1860. It was built with white sandstone from a Bentham quarry,Western (1990), pp.23 & 27 to designs by the line's engineers, Joseph Locke and John Errington.

Legend An image of Xiangliu from the Imperial Encyclopedia According to the Classic of Mountains and Seas (Shanhaijing), Xiangliu (Xiangyao) was a minister of the snake-like water deity Gonggong. Xiangliu devastated the ecology everywhere he went. He was so gluttonous that all nine heads would feed at the same meal. Everywhere he rested or breathed upon (or that his tongue touched, depending on the telling) became boggy with poisonously bitter water, devoid of human and animal life. When Gonggong received orders to punish people with floods, Xiangliu was proud to contribute to their troubles. Eventually, Xiangliu was killed, in some versions of the story by Yu the Great, whose other labors included ending the Great Flood of China, in others by N√ºwa after he was defeated by Zhurong. The Shanhaijing says his blood stank to the point it was impossible to grow grain in the land it soaked and the area flooded, making it uninhabitable. Eventually Yu had to restrain the waters in a pond, over which the Sky Lords built their pavilions. Sun Jiayi identified Xiangliu as an eel: An oral version of the Xiangliu myth, in which Xiangliu is depicted as a nine-headed serpent responsible for floods and other harm, was collected from Sichuan as late as 1983.

He made over 280 Football League appearances in the years after the Second World War. Career Parr played locally for Bristol Boys whom he captained. Pat Beasley signed Parr in February 1957 for Bristol City as a speedy, tough tackling and ball winning wing half. Bristol City had a disastrous six match run in December 1957 which included five defeats whilst conceding 24 goals. Gordon Parr made his debut as a replacement for Alan Williams in the Second Division at left half v Middlesbrough on 28 December 1957 as a 0‚Äì0 draw brought the poor defensive run to an end. Parr made only 2 appearances in 1957‚Äì58 and none in the next two seasons of Second Division football. The first two seasons back in the Third Division also saw Parr consigned to reserve team football. With the \\"Robins\\" languishing in mid table the following season Parr was given a second chance. By this time he was more of a defensive mid fielder marking tightly but retaining his earlier tough tackling style. Parr replaced David Pyle at right half early in 1962‚Äì63 making 16 appearances and playing in the two Third round FA Cup ties with Aston Villa. Bobby Etheridge began the following season in the right half position but Parr replaced him with Bristol City lying 14th in the table. Parr remained at right half for the rest of season 1963‚Äì64 making 39 appearances scoring two goals as City climbed the table to finish 5th. Parr also played in all of the 5 FA Cup ties as City lost 1‚Äì5 at Sunderland in the 4th round. Parr started as right half in the following season and made 21 appearances scoring one goal before first Terry Bush and then Chuck Drury completed the season in the right half position as Bristol City finished runners up in the Third Division. In the first season back in the Second Division 1965‚Äì66 Parr regained the right half position after injury to Chuck Drury and ended the season in possession of the shirt making 17+1 appearances scoring one goal. The goal came in the last game of the season as City won 4‚Äì1 v Ipswich Town in the final match of John Atyeo's long career with Bristol City. After the 5th-place finish of 1965‚Äì66 followed a succession of seasons fighting to avoid relegation. In 1966‚Äì67 City finished 15th and Parr made 38 appearances at right half in a defence of Mike Gibson, Tony Ford, Alec Briggs, Parr, Jack Connor and Gordon Low that missed only 7 games between them in the whole season. The same defence played in the 5th round FA Cup tie as City lost 2‚Äì0 at Tottenham Hotspur. Parr switched to a central defensive role at left half replacing Low as new signing Ken Wimshurst took the right half shirt in a midfield position. Parr also deputised at full back making 36 appearances in 1967‚Äì68 as City finished 19th but again enjoyed an FA Cup run to the 5th round before losing 2‚Äì0 at Leeds United. Parr and Jack Connor were an ever-present central defensive pairing in 1968‚Äì69 making 42 appearances as City rose to 16th. Parr made a further 38 appearances with new central defensive partner Dickie Rooks signed from Middlesbrough in 1968‚Äì69 with Bristol City finishing in a respectable 14th place. Parr continued alongside Rooks in the following season making 31+2 appearances as City slipped to 19th place. Parr played in 8 of the 9 League Cup ties as City lost 1‚Äì3 on aggregate after extra time in the two legged semi final. In his final season at Ashton Gate Parr made only 2+3 appearances in 1971‚Äì72. Gordon Parr moved to Waterford the League of Ireland champions on a free transfer. He won his first senior medal as the Blues retained their League Championship and this gave Parr the opportunity to play in the 1972‚Äì73 European Cup against AC Omonia, although briefly, as Waterford lost in the 1st knockout round despite winning the home leg. Parr returned to play two seasons in the Western League with Minehead before retiring. After retiring from playing Gordon Parr returned to his earlier profession as a self-employed electrician living in Abbots Leigh near Bristol. Gordon Parr could be content that he had made the utmost use of his limited natural talent, and that never in his life had he let his side down on the football field.

Stubbs was described as a tourist attraction, having been flooded with cards and letters, and drawing 30 to 40 tourists each day (most of whom were en route to other Alaska destinations, such as Denali) who hoped to meet \\"the mayor\\". Stubbs's position was honorary, as the town is only a historic district. Every afternoon, Stubbs went to a nearby restaurant and drank water laden with catnip out of a wineglass or margarita glass. At least one opinion writer for the Alaska Dispatch News insisted that the whole story was false, and that Talkeetna did not have a cat mayor. Stubbs died on July 21, 2017, at the age of 20 years and 4 months.Stubbs, Talkeetna‚Äôs honorary cat mayor, dies , by Chris Klint, at KTVA; published July 23, 2017; retrieved July 23, 2017 Early life and election In 1997, Lauri Stec, manager of Nagley's General Store, found Stubbs in a box full of kittens in her parking lot. The owners were giving the kittens away; Stec chose \\"Stubbs\\" because he did not have a tail. Stubbs was widely described as having been elected after a write-in campaign by voters who opposed the human candidates, but National Public Radio pointed out that this could not have happened because \\"the tiny town has no real mayor, so there was no election.\\" Nagley's General Store was used as Stubbs's \\"mayoral office\\" during his tenure. Stubbs was featured in an effort to protest the 2014 U.S. Senate race in Alaska when people urged voters to write Stubbs in on the ballot. Stubbs was featured in a video criticizing both the Democratic and Republican candidates for Senate.  Late life  In 2015, he became too old and slowed down his public presence. He died on July 21, 2017. His owners said that ‚ÄúHe was a trooper until the end of his life.‚Äù. Stubbs lived to the age of 20 years and three months. Stubbs's owners have suggested that another family cat, Denali, may assume Talkeetna's \\"mayoralty\\". Injuries On August 31, 2013, Stubbs was attacked by a dog. He was placed under heavy sedation at a veterinary hospital 70 miles away in Wasilla, having suffered a punctured lung, a fractured sternum, and a deep cut in his side. A crowd-funding page was set up to help pay his medical bills. Stubbs remained in the veterinary hospital for nine days before returning to the upstairs room of the general store. As a result, he was discouraged from roaming. Donations toward his care were received from around the world; the surplus was given to an animal shelter and to the local veterinary clinic. Other incidents included Stubbs being shot by teenagers with BB guns, falling into a restaurant's deep fryer (which was switched off and cool at the time), and hitching a ride to the outskirts of Talkeetna on a garbage truck.

The initiative was the subject of several books, numerous scholarly articles in academic journals, and a Warner Bros. short filmIt Happened in Springfield at Internet Movie Database starring Andrea King. Following the publicity it received, the plan became the national model for citizenship and multicultural education during World War II, and school administrators throughout the U.S. traveled to Springfield to witness the plan in action. The widely stated purpose of the plan was to foster democracy and eliminate racism from schooling. It involved innovative advances in curriculum, including the use of cooperative learning and democratic living classroom activities. Students also participated in projects where they learned about the history and culture of other groups in their broader community. Beyond the school, the plan expanded education into local factories where adult workers were provided with citizenship classes. Lastly, it included new methods for teaching students how to recognize racist propaganda, while it was also innovative in producing positive propaganda, publicizing the advantages of intergroup education for the entire nation. In 1971 a doctoral student at Teachers College, Columbia University viewed The Springfield Plan in retrospect.  References  * Chatto, C I., & Halligan, A. L. (1945).

History The terminal building of the former airport. The airport was first built in 1936 with a 1,200-meter main runway and a 900-meter auxiliary runway. Both runways were 40 meters wide and 32 centimeters thick. The airport was mainly used by the military, but also had civil flights to Chongqing, China's wartime capital. During World War II, the airport was known as Kanchow (Kan Hsien) Airfield and was used by the United States Army Air Forces Fourteenth Air Force as part of the China Defensive Campaign (1942‚Äì1945). Kanchow was used as a photo- reconnaissance base by the Americans, which flew unarmed P-38 Lightning aircraft equipped with an array of mapping cameras on combat missions over Japanese-held territory. The airport also was the temporary base of many P-51 Mustang and B-25 Mitchell medium bombers during the war, which rotated flights in and out of the airfield frequently.

With Mirski at head, Osijek philharmonic performed the most complex pieces of domestic and foreign composers. In 1923 Mirski became the director of the opera at the Croatian National Theatre in Osijek. At that time, among other things, Mirski recognized the potential of a young tambura player Julije Njiko≈° - ƒêule, then still a boy, who would later become the founder of the important Croatian tambura institutions.

His very large landholdings were later the subject of disputes that eventually went to the Supreme Court of the United States. Biography Bartolom√© Baca was born around 1767 in Bel√©n, Nuevo M√©xico. He came from a Spanish aristocratic family, and inherited or acquired great personal wealth. He married Mar√≠a de la Luz Ch√°ves, daughter of Vicente Ch√°ves and Juana Arag√≥n, on 2 May 1790 in San Felipe de Neri, Albuquerque, New Mexico. Baca was made captain of Albuquerque's volunteer militia when it was organized in 1808, carrying out his duties \\"with honor and valor\\". Bartolom√© Baca established himself at Torreon, overlooking the Estancia Valley, where he obtained a grant of land from the Spanish Governor Facundo Melgares. The land was described as bounded \\"on the north, by the Monte del Cibolo; on the east, by the Estancia Springs; on the south, by the Ojo del Cuebro; and on the west by the Abo mountains.\\" The area of the grant was about . Baca took possession of this land in July 1819. Baca lived at San Fernando, but built a large ranch house at Estancia Springs for his three sons, who looked after the ranch. They grazed 40,000 sheep, 900 cattle and 300 mares on the grant. The ranch was profitable until 1833, when Navajo raids increased, killing the shepherds and stealing the livestock, and leading to the ranch eventually being abandoned. Bartolom√© Baca was Governor and Captain-General of New Mexico from 1823 to 1825. Bartolom√© Baca died on 30 Apr 1834 in Tom√©, Nuevo M√©xico. Governor of New Mexico Baca was governor of the province of New Mexico from August 1823 to September 1825. When Captain Baca became g√©fe pol√≠tico, equivalent to Governor, in 1823, the Mexican inhabitants of the territory suffered from constant Apache raids. Baca was also g√©fe militar, and commanded the garrison at Santa Fe, but this had just 119 men and officers. In 1824 the cost of maintaining this company was $35,488. In addition, the settlers maintained a militia at their own expense. Baca used a combination of bribes and treaties to reduce problems with the Navajos and Apaches, and this was generally but by no means always successful. In July 1824 Baca invited all the principal Comanche chiefs to meet with him on the Canadian River. Only a few turned up, and the others could not be found, much to Baca's displeasure. In January 1825 there were Comanche raids near San Elizario and El Paso. Apparently the main Comanche chief obeyed Baca's request to come to Santa Fe on this occasion, but Baca reported that the Comanches were \\"insolent as they have become accustomed to be.\\" In 1825 Baca and New Mexico's legislature, the Diputaci√≥n Provincial, opened the land of the Pueblo Indians of Pecos to settlement by Mexicans wherever the land was not cultivated. Baca issued licenses to U.S. citizens to trap beaver on condition that they hired Mexicans and taught them the skills required. Baca was interested in developing trade with the United States. In the spring of 1824 Baca sent a courier to Council Bluffs, announcing that New Mexico planned to march 1,500 men to the Missouri River to pacify the Indian trobes and open the route for trade, arriving on or before 10 June 1824. In 1825 he commissioned Don Manuel Escud√©ro, the first Mexican to take a caravan along the Santa Fe Trail, to visit the United States to discuss commerce. Escud√©ro, who was a member of the Chihuahua provincial assembly, was to ask for greater protection for Mexican traders. He was robbed by Osages on the left bank of the Arkansas River, for which he gained compensation by the United States. Bartolom√© Baca land grant The Mexican government made grants from the Bartolom√© Baca grant to other settlers in 1829, 1834 and 1841. The United States occupied the territory in 1846, introducing a new land tenure system, while original records of sale were lost. This was to lead to long-running legal disputes over ownership, eventually going to the Supreme Court of the United States in 1897, which found that there was no proof Baca had ever owned the land.

Kristiansen (born December 13, 1962) is a former American politician of the Republican Party. He was a member of the Washington House of Representatives, representing the 39th district, and the former House Minority Leader.http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=26576  Controversy  In 2010, Washington State officials received a formal complaint regarding Representative Kristiansen's campaign finances. According to state law, contributions from a single business were legally capped at $1600 per election. The Rairdon Auto Group, however, contributed four times that amount. This was accomplished by writing 4 separate checks for $1600, with each originating from 4 different Rairdon dealership locations. The dealerships shared ownership and board members, and the donations bore identical dates. During Representative Kristiansen's 2010 campaign for the legislature, the independence of the dealerships was called into question, as well as the legality of using multiple business locations to circumvent campaign contribution limits. In 2009, shortly before receiving campaign contributions from the Rairdon Auto Group, Representative Kristiansen cosponsored HB 2182. The purpose of HB 2182 was to reduce business and operations taxes for automotive dealers and automotive service providers. Legislative documents describe HB 2182 as \\"AN ACT Relating to reducing the business and occupation tax rate for retailers, wholesalers, and service providers of motor vehicles\\" and an amendment of RCW 82.04.860. On February 20, 2018, while arguing against new gun regulations in the State Legislature during a regularly scheduled news conference in the state capital, Olympia, Kristiansen told the media that \\"More people are actually killed by knives than by guns.\\" This comment was in response to a mass shooting that happened just a week earlier in Parkland, Florida, where 17 people were killed. Kristiansen then told a fictitious story about a knife attack in Norway that he claimed took the lives of two dozen children at a youth camp, pressing the point that knives were more dangerous than guns, and as such, no new gun ban legislation should be brought forth. As it turns out, the story told by Rep. Kristiansen was not true and never actually happened. The falsification of the story was confirmed by Norwegian Criminology Professor Hedi Lomell at the University of Oslo and by Jon-√Öge √òysleb√∏, the press attach√© at the Norwegian Embassy in Washington, D.C. In 2016, according to an annual report by the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs, Washington State experienced 18 homicides by knife compared to 95 homicides by firearms. In 2016, Dan Kristiansen received $1,950 from the NRA during WA House Dist. 39, Snohomish race.  Retirement from office  On March 6, 2018, two weeks after the \\"...more people are killed by knives than guns\\" story he told of Norway, Dan Kristiansen announced he will not seek re- election in November. The 39th District representative has stepped down from his role, but will complete his term.

Programmes Dancers who have worked with DanceAbility include Alito Alessi, Emery Blackwell, Karen Nelson, Scott Smith, and Charlene Curtis. Alessi launched DanceAbility with Karen Nelson in 1987, after reading an article about Contact Improvisation in Contact Quarterly dance and improvisation journal. DanceAbility began as a project of the Joint Forces Dance Company, giving a workshop on Contact Improvisation. DanceAbility became an international project beginning with workshops in Germany in 1991; teachers of inclusive and contemporary dance from several countries participated in DanceAbility gatherings annually during the early 1990s in Eugene, Oregon. In the early years of DanceAbility, the majority of inclusive dance teachers were self-taught. DanceAbility offered teacher certification in 1997. Teacher training remains one of its core projects. Teacher training is now given in several countries, including: * the United States (Eugene, Oregon) * Buenos Aires, Argentina * Milan, Italy * Amsterdam, Netherlands * Trier, Germany * Vienna, Austria (at ImPulsTanz Festival) * Helsinki, Finland Following a major donation in 2007 from Marisa De Leon, founder of a school for children with disabilities in Montevideo, Uruguay, DanceAbility International has expanded into Latin America. Workshops have been held in Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Puerto Madryn, S√£o Paulo, and Montevideo. DanceAbility International has been the subject of three documentaries: * Common Ground * All Bodies Speak * Joy Lab Research Alessi's writing on the topic of Contact Improvisation has appeared in Contact Quarterly dance journal, and in Dance, Human Rights, and Social Justice‚ÄîDignity in Motion, edited by Naomi Jackson and Toni Shapiro- Phim.

Romanticism in medicine was an integral part of Romanticism in science. :Romantic writers were far better read in medicine than we tend to remember: Byron consulted popular health manuals by Adair and Solomon; Coleridge read deeply in his physician, James Gillman's, library; Percy Shelley ordered Spallanzani's complete works and immersed himself in the vitalist controversy, while Mary Shelley read Gall and Spurzheim; Blake engraved plates for medical literature published by Joseph Johnson; and Keats, of course, was trained as a physician. The impetus for Romantic ideas in medicine came from the Great Britain, and more specifically Scotland - John Hunter (1728‚Äì93) - and the idea of life as a principle not reducible to material constructs, and John Brown (1735‚Äì88), founder of the Brunonian system of medicine (see also, Romanticism in Scotland#Science). The nexus for Romantic Medicine was Germany, largely nurtured and guided by German natural scientific inquiries regarding the vital aspects of nature, such as that of Johann Friedrich Blumenbach (1752‚Äì1840) and his influential ideas regarding a life principle (Bildungstrieb), a formative drive (nisus formatives) as well as a philosophical tradition that emphasized the dynamic aspects of man and nature, and their essential relationship as part of a unity - German idealism and Naturphilosophie - all guided by Immanuel Kant's (1724‚Äì1804) challenge calling for critical inquiry as the basis for science. The essence of romantic medicine was to overcome the deep crisis that Western medicine found itself in during the latter half of the 1700s by means of a science of life (pathology and physiology grounded in history) that went beyond the simple application of the method of the inertial sciences (physics and chemistry, grounded in mathematics) that had worked so well for inert nature, but was found wanting when applied to vital nature, but also a science of life that went beyond the idea of medicine as a subjective art largely to be left to individual practice. The Zeitgeist of Romantic medicine sought to unite the uneasy partnership of material natural science and subjective clinical practice to create a true scientific foundation for Western medicine (see also Romanticism and epistemology)  The question of life  The issue of life ‚Äì what is life? ‚Äì or the scientific inquiry and quest (questio) regarding vital nature was one that increasingly drew the attention of philosophers and scientists in the 1700s, following the great advances concerning the laws and principles of inert nature - the Copernican, Galilean and Newtonian revolutions in celestial and earthly mechanics - astronomy and physics. With great confidence and optimism, philosophy and science turned to the mystery of life, or rather, that of health - how to restore and maintain it. Those most immediately drawn to this field were those who had some concern with health issues, physicians in particular. Thus, a natural alliance formed between natural philosophy and science on the one hand and medicine on the other. What they had in common was to advance the discipline of the study of living functions or physiology.  Irritability  Because of the influence of the inertial sciences and the success of the method used to gain knowledge of the laws and principles applying to inert nature, the initial approach was to apply the same method to vital nature. What emerged from this was the extensive study in the first part of the 1700s of ‚Äòirritability‚Äô, this being based on the central nervous system and involving physical forces such as electricity and magnetism. However, the mechanico-material explanation was not fruitful when it came to actually dealing with life in the case of healthcare practitioners. Albrecht Von Haller's (1708‚Äì77) 'irritability' hypothesis and its failure adequately to explain the phenomenon of life, as well as the waning capacity of the Western mentality to participate living nature that lay at the root of the Hippocratic system of humours (or noetic capacities), led to a split between those who clung to the ancient tradition, but in name only (becoming routinists or empiricists), and those, largely in the universities, who sought a (material- mechanical) scientific basis regarding life and medicine. This split led to a widely acknowledged crisis in Western ‚Äòmedicine‚Äô in the latter half of the 1700s. :That medicine c. 1800 was caught in the throes of a foundational crisis is testified to by numerous sources and above all by the documented collective striving of all leading European countries to totally reform medicine. No later than the 1780s ‚Äì as the sources clearly show ‚Äì were the leading doctors aware of the critical situation.  Romantic medicine and dynamics  The attempt on the part of philosophers and scientists to come to grips with the question of life led to an emphasis away from mechanics or statics, to dynamics. Life was action, living movement, a manifestation of an underlying polarity in nature and the universe. Instead of seeing nature from a ‚Äòone-eyed, color blind‚Äô spectator perspective, what was needed was a perspective that was binocular and participative. Inertial science had advanced in man's understanding of inert nature, her outer form or shell, what Francis Bacon termed natura naturata (outer form or appearance). However, it was not capable of going beyond this to a more dynamic discernment or apperception of the living inner content of nature, the domain of life ‚Äì life in general, not just life biological as Samuel Taylor Coleridge, at the philosophic core of the scientific effort to penetrate to natura naturans, put it, asking further ‚Äúwhat is not life?‚Äù based on the understanding of life as a dynamic polarity between powers, forces and energies. As one observer wrote \\"Die eigentliche Lebenslehre der Romantik aber war: Polarit√§t.\\" But as he promptly adds: \\"Sie klingt uns √ºberall entgegen, nicht nur in der Naturphilosophie.\\" = The foundations = = Bacon's Novum Organum = The groundwork for this intensive search to understand life was laid down by Francis Bacon, who sought to sweep clean the Augean stables of late medieval Scholasticism, with its increasingly obtuse and confused attempts to approach natura naturans (nature becoming or 'naturing') using the old Greek noetic capacity, already long lost to the Western mind and having gone underground into the arts, but also the nominalist straying into abstractions and refractions in their study of natura naturata via secondary phenomena as in Newton's study of color (cf. Goethe's Farbenlehre or Study of Color). Neither the Realists nor the Nominalists of late medieval scholasticism could handle the task before them, and Bacon sought, at the start of the Age of Science, to provide a method to approach nature's outer form rationally, but by means of a conscious use of man's higher faculty in the form of the ‚Äòforethoughtful inquiry‚Äô (‚Äòlux siccum‚Äô), that is, an inquiry that brought a particular idea, itself evinced through the mind and the domain of true philosophy, namely, the \\"mind‚Äôs self-experience in the act of thinking\\" (Coleridge's Biographia Literaria), or epistemology. The Baconian approach was further developed by C.S. Peirce who made a distinction between induction and abduction: the latter being the method of discovering hypotheses, the former that of testing them. = Coleridge and the role of philosophy = Bacon's work provided what Coleridge termed ‚Äòmethod‚Äô ‚Äì the derivation of laws or ideas to guide the mind (mens) in its observation of nature, out of which emerges understanding (concepts) and principles (reason). It is also the task of philosophy, as Coleridge emphasized, to \\"settle the nomenclature,\\" as the key to science is terminology where one term is not synonymous with something else, as is the case in demotic language, but instead the term discloses its meaning and increases understanding and knowledge. This was further developed by Heidegger and phenomenology (such as with the term Veranlassung). Greek philosophy (love of wisdom or sophia) later emerged as philology (love of the Logos) to interpret philosophical works. It is this penetration of nature using both the eductive (as opposed to the projective) arts (innate wisdom) and (Logos- backed) sciences to achieve a rational, conscious understanding of nature, both outer form and inner essence that those who became part of the Romantic movement in England and Germany in particular, were seeking. It is not surprising that Romanticism, a scientific endeavor and quest, involved the cultural sciences or humanities (epistemology, philology, literature, poetry, music, etc.), as well as the natural sciences. = Search for method for vital nature = Romanticism rejected the application of the method that had worked so well for inert nature to the realm of living nature, or life biological. While living organisms contained a degree of a mineral, material nature amenable to being approached via the laws of material physics and chemistry, life itself could not thereby be satisfactorily explained. On the one side, the material scientists sought a solution in reducing the non-material or metaphysical to ‚Äòjust‚Äô a manifestation of the material, essentially thereby ignoring that this did not at all account for life. On the other side, a part of the ‚ÄòOld School‚Äô, drawing from the Hippocratic humoral theory (involving non-mechanical, etheric concepts), sought to emphasize the non-physical or vital aspect of nature, which somehow existed above and outside of nature and directed its activities. The Romantic scientists and philosophers rejected both reductionist mechano-materialism (material natural science) and conflationist mystical-idealism (vitalism). = Locke, Fichte and German Idealism = Romanticism also involved a fundamental understanding of functional polarities as the basis for and essence of life as Idea, Law and Principle. One of these polarities in cultural history involved the seminal influence of the English genius and the germinal or gestational genius of German-language culture. Coleridge mentions this in his Essays on Method, and the theme is explored in D.E. Faulkner-Jones' The English Spirit. The seminal ideas came from Francis Bacon regarding scientific method and from John Locke regarding the ideas of self-consciousness and mind. Locke set up a relationship between mind (subject) and outer world (object) wherein the mind is set in motion by objects producing sensations but also has an internal activity of its own (reflection) that acts on the sensations to create perception and conceptions. For Locke, the activity of mind is paramount, as for Bacon, and it is only through the activity of mind (consciousness) that the outer world can be ‚Äòrealized‚Äô as causative and as actual. Identity for Locke lay in the capacity for the ‚ÄòI‚Äô (consciousness) to unite disparate ‚Äòdeeds‚Äô or actions of nature (as cognized by the mind), into a meaningful unity. For Locke, identity of self exists in nothing other than participation in life (the etheric) by means of fluctuating particles of matter rendered meaningful and real by acts of the mind and consciousness. The Romantics, as Locke, refused to accept the view that life is a product of ‚Äúthe chance whirlings of unproductive particles‚Äù (Coleridge). Locke's ideas were taken up by Johann Fichte in Germany and developed into a philosophy of nature and natural science based on mind and consciousness, which he termed Wissenschaftslehre. Fichte, as so many of that time, was also inspired to challenge Kant's views on human freedom (constraints by material forces) and the limits to cognition, and sought this in Locke's emphasis on the mind and consciousness as the pivotal actor and creator of reality. For Fichte, selfhood (Ichheit) is an act not a thing or a substance, and being or identity consists in the acts of mind and self-consciousness, such that being and identity are co-operant. Fichte's work heavily influenced German philosophy and science, leading to a general system of thought known as German Idealism (including Schelling and Hegel), though this idealism would either end paradoxically in accepting the methods of material science for natural science (Naturphilosophie ‚Äì Schelling), or in academic and lifeless dialectics (Hegel) that negate life rather than support it and used for political ends (Marxism). = The Idea of the living principle = Prior to Fichte's writings, the idea of life as a power and principle independent of and not reducible to matter or substance had been put forward in England and Scotland in the mid-1700s, by the philosopher, Thomas Reid and John Hunter (surgeon), a highly influential anatomist and surgeon as well as an observational scientist in the true Baconian tradition. Hunter rested the idea of the life principle on solid observation of nature. For him, anatomy and structure, matter and form were simply outer expressions of a vital dynamics. This idea found a receptive soil in German philosophy and eclectic medicine, as represented by Christoph Hufeland (1762‚Äì1836), which had developed the concept of a life force or energy (Lebenskraft) as well, but one that had remained largely speculative or metaphorical. In 1781, Johan Friedrich Blumenbach, a natural philosopher and researcher published his thoughts regarding the Bildungstrieb, a dynamic power that was evolutive, progressive, and creative. Blumenbach's work provided for the later important distinction (by Samuel Hahnemann) between a sustaining power (homeostasis) and a generative power (Erzeugungskraft), not just for procreation in all its myriad forms, but also creative acts of the mind, which Coleridge said involved the imagination (as opposed to fancy), both primary (unconscious figuration) involving perception, and secondary, the latter leading to apperceptive concepts as a result of conscious acts of the mind (ideas applied to perceptions). All of this set up a climate for ideas and concepts that went beyond the mechanistic method of inertial science, one that allowed a role for creative actions of the mind (works of art) as well as reactions to sensations involving objects. Equally, the climate was conducive to considering a dynamic between subject (self and mind/consciousness) and object, one in which the mind is both receptive and pro-active, and also one in which the mind is critical to determining the meaning and reality of any given stimulation from the world outside. = Crisis in medicine = By the end of the 1700s, medicine, not only in Germany, but throughout Europe, was in a deep crisis. This widely acknowledged crisis was brought into stark relief in 1795 in a famous critical essay by a German physician and philosopher, (1766‚Äì1827),Ignaz Je≈æower, Das Buch der Tr√§ume, 1928, p. 499. in the ‚Äòshot‚Äô that was heard around the medical world. \\"Erhard's attack focused on what he called the \\"uncertainty\\" of medical knowledge and its failure to measure up to the criteria of a philosophical Wissenschaft. He located the central problem in doctors' lack of a clear idea either of illness in general or of particular diseases.\\"  The ‚Äòelements‚Äô of a new system  Johann B. Erhard‚Äôs essay, coupled with the earlier introduction of the Brunonian system into German medical circles, almost immediately triggered a remarkable surge of writings by a graduating medical student, Andreas R√∂schlaub. R√∂schlaub wrote his doctoral dissertation on the work of a rather obscure and then little known Scottish physician, John Brown, Elementa Medicinae. Almost at the same time, in 1796, a German physician., Samuel Friedrich Hahnemann, who had been highly critical of the medical practices of his day, published a remarkable essay on the treatment of disease that became the foundation for the homeopathic approach to medicine, as part of a more comprehensive scientific approach for therapeutics he termed Heilkunde, and then later Heilkunst. (Lesser Writings, p. 251) While Brown‚Äôs work had been available in Germany for almost 15 years, since its publication in 1780, it had been mostly ignored or rejected, as in England itself, because the method outlined by Brown was seen as a mechanical approach, which hardly endeared it to the German philosophical tradition and mindset seeking a more dynamic, vital approach. However, R√∂schlaub grasped, where no one else had been able, even Schelling with his Naturphilosophie, that Brown had provided the very elements of an approach to health and sickness that were dynamic in nature and by means of a synthetic concept ‚Äì ‚Äòexcitation‚Äô ‚Äì that was the practical application of a Lockean and Fichtean approach to the problem of cognition due to subject/object or observer/observed, to the problem of the relationship between qualitative and quantitative, and also to the very problem of life itself. \\"Brunonian doctrine therefore fulfilled Erhard's call for a medical practice based on the \\"real\\" causes of disease rather than on divination of the meaning of symptoms. ... where Erhard had offered only criticism, Brunonianism offered an alternative. Brunonianism now stood ready to complete what Erhard had begun, and to inaugurate a revolution in German medicine.\\" = R√∂schlaub and the general theory of disturbance and disorder = Through R√∂schlaub‚Äôs writings, mainly between 1795 and 1806, Brown‚Äôs conception of life was brought out: as a potential in us that is brought into action and reality as a result of the workings of the actual (excitants or stimulants) on us, and of the living principle as a receptive potentiality (‚Äòexcitability‚Äô, or the capacity to be impinged upon) and pro-active (‚Äòexcitement‚Äô, or the capacity to respond to impingements), that is, as a dynamic power. Brown's use in the original Latin of ‚Äòincitability‚Äô (rather than the more restricted term used in the English ‚Äì ‚Äòexcitability) contained the germ of a distinction between the sustentive (Lebenskraft) and generative (Bildungstrieb) powers, as Coleridge astutely noted: ‚ÄúBrown has not proved that the Incitability itself cannot be altered ‚Äì not merely thro‚Äô incitement ‚Äì but unmittlebar [unmediated]‚Äì Says the Jena recensent, Feb. 1799, No. 48 (Notebooks 1:38). He might have been thinking of Brown's discussion of contagious diseases wherein we see this interplay between the general action (‚Äòaffection‚Äô) of the sustentive power (excitability/excitement) and the more specific and different action of ‚Äòcontagions‚Äô (e.g., LXXVI: ‚ÄúContagious diseases are] not an exception...because...no general affection follows the application of contagion, if no undue excess or defect of excitement is the consequence...\\"), or his reference to a pro-creative as well as sustaining power as in CCCXXVI (‚Äúevery living system lives in that which it procreates‚Ä¶that the system of nature remains and maintains an eternal vigour‚Äù). When added to his distinction between beneficial (‚Äòagreeable‚Äô) and harmful (malignities) ‚Äòexcitants‚Äô, Brown provided the basis for understanding how the level of excitability/incitability (potential) can be shifted upwards (potentiated). Finally, Brown introduced the powerful idea that pathology (unhealthy function) was simply physiology (healthy function) extended beyond a certain range of sustainable variability or pulsation (a function of the polarities that constitute life). R√∂schlaub worked initially with Fichtean insights and then Schelling and his Naturphilosophie, establishing a dynamic philosophical basis in natural science for medicine. However, he realized that medicine could not be restricted to natural science, even a dynamic science grounded in physiology (the germ of which was provided by Dr. Richard Saumarez in England in 1798, A New System of Physiology), but had an artistic/aesthetic side. In this regard, he made a distinction first between Wissenschaftslehre (natural science) and Heilkunde (the practical, clinical side of therapeutics), in which latter work he established the first teaching clinic, in concert with Dr. Markus, in Bamberg, Germany. R√∂schlaub made a further distinction between biophysical (Heilkunde) and biomedical (Heilkunst). The second took him into the very dimension of life itself, the etheric, that is, beyond the physical, a dimension that required an entirely different organ of knowledge from the intellect or Sinn (mens) that was the foundation of both WissenschaftsHeillehre and Heilkunde, as the construction of a protocol entails arte. Unbeknownst to him, one of his countrymen had been working on the development and understanding of this new cognitive capacity, called the Gem√ºt. As a result, Goethe was able to ‚Äòsee‚Äô (anschauende Erkenntnis) into the dynamic realm of nature (natura naturans) and comprehend the very movement behind the forms, and the very functions that determined a given form, including the dynamic archetype (Kraftwesen) out of which all forms of a given Idea (such as ‚Äòplant‚Äô or ‚Äòanimal‚Äô) emanated. It was Goethe who founded the science of morphology. Although Goethe termed this study Metamorphosenlehre, it was, more accurately stated, a pleomorphic process. This new cognitive capacity is what was needed for the physician or Leibarts to go beyond the inner symptomatics and outer semiotics of a case as a basis for assessment and evaluation used by the Old School, and to avoid the pitfalls of the merely empirical approach. It was the task of the physician to draw out (‚Äòeduce‚Äô), and allow ‚Äòto come forth‚Äô (Heidegger's Veranlassung and Hervorbringung), the natural state of health of the individual so as to enable him to undertake his individualized higher purpose in life. Heilkunst was not simply another projective art form such as painting, music, sculpture or poetry, but an educative art, in which the artist, the Heilk√ºnstler (Hahnemann), seeks to bring forth out of the tangle of illness and disease at all levels, the true physiological selfhood, the fully liberated (at liberty to follow his higher purpose or aspiration) and conscious (a super-conscious mind higher than ordinary or waking consciousness) man or mensch. R√∂schlaub also realized that Brown had only provided the basic ‚Äòelements‚Äô of a method for the science of life, and that what was still needed was the overarching or archetypal function from which all other functions were derivable and given meaning and direction, and which would also then provide the very goal and purpose of medicine and health, the ‚Äòpositive‚Äô as well as the ‚Äònegative‚Äô (removal of suffering) sides of healthcare. However, this overarching, archetypal function would have to wait until the 20th century for its discovery and elucidation by Dr. Wilhelm Reich (Super-imposition or √úberlagerung) and Rudolf Steiner's Metamorphosis, the exponents of the underlying Kraftwesen. = Hahnemann and the special theory of disease = At the same time that R√∂schlaub embarked on his quest for a true science of life and health, a compatriot, Dr. Samuel Hahnemann, who had quit his medical practice earlier in protest against the lack of science and efficacy of the Old School and the empty ‚Äòmetaschematisms‚Äô of the academic ‚Äòdoctors‚Äô, had also begun a similar quest for a true system of medicine. Hahnemann's essay of 1796 and subsequent writings, all part of an extended Organon der Heilkunst, laid down the basic foundation for a distinction between the sustentive (Lebenserhaltungskraft) [Aphorism 63, 205 fn., 262) and generative (Erzeugungskraft) [Aphorism 21-22] sides of the living principle, between physic, operating under the natural healing law of opposites (contraria contrarius), and medicine proper, operating under the natural curative law of similars (similia similibus), and between disease, a dynamica impingement on the generative power (degeneration), a derangement of the sustentive power, or disturbance of homeostasis. Hahnemann further established various principles for the application of the law of similars, including a crucial distinction between diseases of a fixed nature (tonic diseases), and those of a variable nature, the basis for the later discovery by some of his followers of a dual remedy prescribing, each remedy addressing one ‚Äòside‚Äô of disease, the tonic and pathic sides. Hahnemann set out a comprehensive approach to the diagnosis and treatment of disease, including a nosology.  Details of Heilkunst  Hahnemann argued, logically, that the material effects of disease could not be their own cause (causa morbii). Disease was instead a dynamic affection of the generative power occasioned by a spirit-like morbid entity (Krankheitswesen) [Aphorisms 22, 28] that had the power to impinge upon the generative power of a human (Menschenkraftwesen) [Aphorism 289 fn.], acting as malignant ‚Äòexcitants‚Äô in the Brunonian sense. However, this power depended on a susceptibility or receptivity (negative resonance) caused by weakening of the life force from various malignities (Brown's underlying diathesis). The disease process consists of a dual action: the initial action (Eerstwirkung) [Aphorisms 70,62,64,65] of the disease agent, which impinges upon the generative power, which is generally imperceptible (such as the initial infection by the measles microbe), and the counter or after-action (Gegenwirkung [Aph. 63,112, 115], Nachwirkung) [Aph. 62,70, 71] of the sustentive power, which produces the various sufferings the patient complains about. While the fixed nature of tonic diseases could be identified by discerning the underlying causal state of mind, along with a curative medicine based on fixed principles, the variable or pathic diseases could only be identified, along with their curative medicine, through the symptoms (suffering or pathos) produced by the disease in the patient. However, such an approach was problematic as a person could have more than one disease at a time (Aph. 40-44). This then required a principle to organize the symptoms into an identifiable complex (Inbegriff) correspondent to a given disease state. Just as each tonic disease has a unique state of mind disturbance, so does each pathic disease contain a unique disturbance of the thermal organization in man. This approach to pathic diseases Hahnemann termed homeopathy (from the Greek homoios and pathos, or similar suffering). This approach expanded empiricism from its limitation within the bounds of Erfahrung (experience of outer forms or natura naturata) to Erlebnis provings (experience via the life body of natura naturans). The tonic diseases were to be found in various jurisdictions: homotoxic (toxins), homogenic (physical and emotional traumas), pathogenic, iatrogenic and ideogenic (spiritual diseases engendered by false belief, which he termed the \\"highest diseases\\" - as compared to the ‚Äòdeepest‚Äô pathic diseases). The pathic diseases are found in reversible layers (‚Äòlayers prescribing‚Äô). Because the pathic diseases generally arise out of the more primary constant (tonic) diseases, such as the chronic diseases that arise out of the chronic miasms, Hahnemann also laid down the principle that the tonic diseases should be treated first, and second any remaining pathic diseases. :In order to treat successfully the other cases of disease occurring in man, and which, be they acute or chronic, differ so vastly among each other [pathic], if they cannot be referred to some primary disease which is constant in its character [tonic], they must each be regarded as peculiar diseases, and a medicine which in its pure effects on the healthy body shows symptoms similar to those of the case before us, must be administered. (Lesser Writings, p. 693) While the curative medicines for the tonic diseases could be largely determined by the principle linking disease and medicinal agent for the relevant jurisdiction, pathic disease treatment required a corresponding image of derangement of the Lebenskraft or Leib (executive organ of the Kraftwesen) so that this could be matched to the image presented by the patient. The problem lay in that a patient could present with more than one disease, each with a particular grouping of symptoms, but how could the practitioner link which symptoms manifest disorder(s) and of those ascribable to disease, and to which disease of the several possible at a given time in the patient, and finally, how could one trace any symptoms so identified to their origins? Here Hahnemann's genius adduced a living experience (Erlebnis) of the essence of a natural substance (Naturwesen) by way of a human prover, and in doing so, also provided the very practical scientific basis for removing the barrier set up by Kantian intellect between observer and observed, by invoking the cognitive capacity of Goethe's Gem√ºt (Aphorism 253 of the Organon der Heilkunst). Goethe himself, later in his life, recognized that Hahnemann had found a way to apply to and through human nature what he was doing with Mother Nature. In the light of difficulties treating more complex cases, Hahnemann undertook further research and developed a theory of chronic miasms, which are fixed nature diseases of the pathogenic type (originally infectious, but also inherited) which give rise to all the (secondary) chronic diseases, which are pathic in nature (cf. R√∂schlaub's Pathogenesis). Hahnemann also gave indications as to when the practitioner could tell that the disease had been cured by the similar medicine and healing was underway (the complete process termed \\"heilen\\" or remediation). Constantine Hering, often called the Father of Homeopathy in the US, further developed these guidelines, which are often referred to as \\"Hering's Law or Principles\\" : *from less vital to more vital organs *in the case of pain, from above down *in the same direction as the natural disease process. This was later expanded in the latter half of the 19th century by Dr. James Tyler Kent who noticed that when disease was suppressed or several groups of symptoms (diseases) developed in a patient over time, that the remedial process proceeded in the reverse order of their emergence. This provides the basis for a sequential treatment of diseases. If some symptoms become worse some time after the similar medicine or there is even a return of old symptoms, essentially in chronic, complex cases, this Hahnemann identified as part of the healing process, which involves the counteraction of the sustentive power of the Kraftwesen against the medicine (similar ‚Äòdisease‚Äô).[Aph. 63-64] While medicine had historically recognized, even into Hahnemann's time, the law of similars (similia similibus), it was also wary of its use because of risk of harm with the improper dose, and had largely abandoned it in favor of the other approach set out by Hippocrates involving the law of opposites, that is, acting to support the physis or sustentive power. Dr. Hahnemann discovered a way to attenuate the dose so that it could be rendered harmless but remain therapeutically active, what is often referred to as ‚Äòdynamization‚Äô. Later he also discovered a way in which to sublimate, or the increase in dynamic power, of medicines (cf. Brown's sthenic enhancement). Because of the use of these two laws, we have two great realms of therapeutics: medicine proper, (medic-al) which is the application of the law of similars, and physic-al, which is the application of the law of opposites. This gives us the mutually interactive and supportive jusrisdictions of the true Heilkundiger and Heilk√ºnstler ‚Äì physician and medician, involving respectively a \\"physic\\" approach based on the law of opposites and a \\"medic\\" approach based on the law of similars. = Compeers, not rivals = Dr. Brown provided the essential elements for a new, functional (actions of powers, forces and energies) approach to understanding life and health, which insights were elaborated by Drs. R√∂schlaub and Hahnemann. Through their work, a fundamental set of dynamic polarities emerged with which to understand the essential polaric nature of life itself: * sustentive and generative sides of the living power * disturbances that lead first to disorders which can render one susceptible to contracting disease * physical and medical interventions ‚Äì physician and medician * regimen and remedial agents for physic * tonic and pathic diseases/chronic miasms and chronic diseases * Erfahrung/Erlebnis * Healing and curing * Disease process: direct action of disease wesen and counteraction of human wesen * Remedial process: curative action and healing reaction At the same time, Goethe's scientific work on the underlying living functions in nature and Dr. Saumarez's new physiology of functions provided the necessary basis for understanding health and life. Underneath it all lay the elements of the Brunonian system, with its dynamic interplay of impression and response, positive or negative in terms of health (physiology) and divergences therefrom (pathology). = Goethe and Hahnemann = Goethe's approach to Mother Nature provided the theoretical foundation for and found a practical application in human nature in the works of Samuel Hahnemann. Goethe was aware of Hahnemann and his new approach to disease, and was treated using Hahnemann's system of medicine, Heilkunst. On one occasion Goethe wrote: :...Dr. Samuel Hahnemann...certainly a world-famous physician...I believe more than ever in this wonderful doctor‚Äôs theory as I have experienced...and continue to experience so clearly the efficacy of a very small administration.‚Äù And in another letter he strongly proclaimed himself a ‚ÄúHahnemannian disciple‚Äù... In his famous play, Faust, Goethe has the lead character, Mephistopheles, assert the homeopathic principle of similars: ‚ÄúTo like things like, whatever one may ail; there‚Äôs certain help.‚Äù :In his later life and in his writing and diaries, Goethe writes in Faust: ‚ÄòSimilia Similibus applies to all disorders‚Äò, identifying the central theme of homeopathy and elaborating his sympathy and understanding of homeopathy, as illustrated in Wilhelm Meister‚Äôs Apprenticeship and his Tower Society which ‚Äòadopts the homeopathic approach to its own psychological methods by using the irrational beliefs of its patients to cure them‚Äò, portraying the ‚Äòmistaken ideas as illness‚Äô, and using sickness to combat sickness. [also Werthe] Goethe wrote several letters in 1820 mentioning and supporting ‚ÄòHahnemann‚Äôs method‚Äô, ‚ÄòHahnemann‚Äôs terminology‚Äô, and declaring his ‚Äòconfession of faith of a Hahnemannian disciple‚Äô, and indicating that he had read his works and looked forward to reflecting on ‚Äòthe wonder physician‚Äô. Goethe was also aware of and followed Hahnemann's dietary rules. In 1826, he wrote to the Grand Duke Karl August that his diet was ‚Äòalmost Hahnemannian in its strictness‚Äô. Hahnemann grasped and worked directly with Goethe's key contribution to Romantic epistemology, the Gem√ºt, or emotional mind and resonance organ, as well as its polarity to the Geist or spiritual mind, the directive organ: Geistes oder Gem√ºths Zustandes des Kranken; Geistes- oder Gem√ºths-Krankheiten; gem√ºthlicher und geistiger Charakter; Gem√ºthsart; Gem√ºths- und Denkungs- Art; Geistes- und Gem√ºths-Organe, Gem√ºths-Verstimmung. Hahnemann undertook in the human realm what Goethe had explored in the plant realm with his morphology, that 'adventure of reason' Kant had stated was not possible, and observed first hand, through a living experience (Erlebnis) the impact of a natural Wesen (dynamic, living essential power) on a human Wesen (initially himself, and later other volunteers), producing a systematic image of the disturbance it produced in terms of pathology (alterations in feelings, functions and sensations) and semiology (outwardly perceptible signs), both over time in the one person, and then over time in a number of people giving an image (Bild) of the disturbance through its various expressions and manifestations, a Goethean approach. Indeed, the entire series and progression of provings or living experiences of medicinal substances by overtly healthy people constitutes an example of what Goethe was promoting as true scientific research: :The only way for a scientist to establish connections between seemingly isolated Erfahrungen or phenomena is through the \\"Vermannigfaltigung eines jeden einzelnen Versuches.\\" [cf. Hahnemann's Materia Medica derived from a plurality of provers for each medicament and the plurality of provings comprising the whole] The scientist must work \\"indefatigably\\" through the manifold permutations and forms of a particular experiment (Naturlehre 35). The scientist must first conduct a series [Reihe] of experiments and, second, serialize them, i.e. consider them as one continuous and complete series of experiments. Studied in this manner‚Äîa method that I laid out above as the first step in the practice of morphology‚Äîthese serialized experiments can represent \\"einen Versuch, nur eine Erfahrung\\" (Naturlehre 34) [cf. Hahnemnn's Arzneiversuche]. The serialization and subsequent reflection [meditation] on singular experiments and Erfahrungen, writes Goethe, produces an \\"Erfahrung [Phenomenon] von einer h√∂hern Art.\\" In his approach to disease diagnoses and treatment, Hahnemann avoided what Goethe considered the ‚Äògreatest failure‚Äô (Unheil) and fault of material science, namely the separation of experimenter from nature, producing abstract hypotheses (notions) and artificial (k√ºnstlich) approaches/treatments based on an accumulation of disparate facts, rather than seeing nature as a complex web of associations, and understanding, as did Hahnemann and Goethe that \\"scientific knowledge emerges out of relationships and historical contexts.\\" Hahemann also sought to understand disease in its historical progression, as in the case of his Wesensgeschichte of Psora, the archetype (tonic) of inherited chronic disease, as well as its pleomorphic unfolding via numerous (gradated) levels of secondary (pathic) diseases, which then required a sequential (scalar) approach to treatment. Goethe's morphological insights provide the theoretical basis for Hahnemann's empirical discoveries and living experiments ('provings' or Erlbenisse). In these provings, Hahnemann sought to contemplate the movement, the flow and transformation of a disease state (Gestalt), not just an abstract image. Hahnemann also had a Goethean understanding of the sequential nature or unfolding of a disease phenomenon. In Hahnemann's distinction between the two sides of the Lebenskraft ‚Äì the sustentive or Erhaltungskraft and the generative or Erzeugungskraft (Bildungstrieb), we find the polar logic identified in Goethe's Chromatology ‚Äì ‚Äòthe sufferings and deeds of light‚Äô via a turbid medium, in the struggle between light energy (Licht) and the now identified 'dark' energy (Finsternis). We also find this polarity, as well as Goethe's distinction between the spectrum of dark and of light, in the distinction Hahnemann made between primary or tonic disease (based on a super- sensible knowing of psychic states involving alterations in circumstances, occurrents and behaviors via the Goethean Gem√ºt or super-sensible cognitive organ) and secondary or pathic disease (based on the sensible manifestation of life energy at the somatic level in terms of feelings, functions and sensations, as well as signs). For Goethe the turbid medium is the atmosphere (airy realm), for Hahnemann it is the living organism (fluid or etheric realm). Goethe's interplay of Licht and Finsternis can also be seen in Hahnemann's polarity between Geist (Spirit) and Wesen (Dynamis). The objections that Goethe leveled against the taxonomy of Linnaeus in botany can be found in the medical sphere in Hahnemann's criticism of the blindly empirical or abstractly intellectual nosology of his time that took a few outer elements, arbitrarily conflated them, then confounded similarity of appearance here with identity of cause and origin. Hahnemann's criticism also was based on an historical study of the morphology of this medical state of mind or Kurwesen, much as Goethe considered the study of history of a phenomenon as a form of knowledge (as did the Greeks). Equally, Hahnemann was critical of a static approach to disease nosology, which was constantly shape- shifting as the interaction between Krankheitwesen and Menschenwesen expressed different aspects of the same underlying disease (these being considered different diseases in the static Linnean nosology of materialistic medicine). Hahnemann also understood that there was an element of fixity and variability to disease (found in his distinction (1796) between primary (tonic) and secondary (pathic) diseases, just as Goethe accepted a degree of form and structure at the physical level whilst pointing to the underlying dynamics leading to new forms over time (Darwin's adaptation). = Lutze and Sch√∂nlein = The works of Hahnemann and R√∂schlaub were continued and furthered by Drs. Arthur Lutze and Johan Sch√∂nlein (1793‚Äì1864) respectively. Lutze (1813‚Äì1870) took the foundations of Hahnemann's approach to disease and placed it on a solid romantic footing in consciously and consistently applying dual remedy prescribing (tonic and pathic disease associations in a given patient). Where Hahnemann had hesitated and eventually withdrew his public support in the 5th edition of his Organon der Heilkunst for dual remedy prescribing, having been unable yet to establish a principle upon which to ground it rationally (what is known as the ‚Äòdual remedy affair‚Äô), Lutze later re-issued the 5th edition with the withdrawn dual remedy section and clinically practiced based on such an approach. His contribution is recognized in the monument to both Hahnemann and Lutze in K√∂then, Germany.\\"Memories around the world\\" R√∂schlaub's innovative work in establishing a teaching clinic based on the Brunonian system, in conjunction with Dr. Albert Marcus, was developed further by J. L. Sch√∂nlein (1793‚Äì1864), who is recognized explicitly even in allopathic historiography for having established the scientific foundation for the modern teaching and practice clinic. This foundation is one based on natural science, but also on the arte (Pascal's spirit of finesse) of the practitioner, which is something objective and reproducible though based on a different logic and involving more fugitive causes (allopathic ‚Äòmedicine‚Äô accepting only the first and then only natural inertial science, not a true physiology of functions, both physical and etheric)  The schism  Up until the middle of the 19th century, following the pioneering work of Brown, Hahnemann, R√∂schlaub, Lutze and Sch√∂nlein, to mention only the main figures, the scientific approach to the question of life, particularly as reflected in the development of Healthcare, seemed conducive to the development of a method that was based on a cognitive capacity going beyond mere mentation (Sinn or mens) and a true physiology involving living functions rather than simply mechanics and chemistry. However, it seemed that the Zeitgeist (Spirit of the Times) could not yet accept such an approach, most minds being still fully ensconced in the intellectual phase (Coleridge's \\"epoch of the intellect and the senses\\") of human consciousness. It was only the extraordinary mind of genius that was able at this stage to meet the challenge of a true science of life and mind, what Colerdige termed the ‚ÄúDynamic System of Thought.‚Äù As a result, the analytical approach favored by the French, schooled in the Cartesian system of mind-body duality, and with their significant advances in surgery (albeit based on access to and development of original Greek medical writings and more modern Greek surgical practice), came to dominate Western science. In Germany, the work of Rudolf Virchow, while drawing from the advances made by Romantic science, effectively reduced and simplified them more in line with what the intellect was able to grasp. The achievements of Romantic Science and Medicine could not be denied, but neither could they be accepted; instead, the followers of the Romantic tradition were either denigrated as considered misguided, occult, and ultimately dreamers rather than serious scientists. The following historiographic assessment is the one that has generally prevailed until recently. :Around the middle of the 1800s, medicine makes a gigantic surge into a critical, empirical-analytical research project: Virchow's demand for a strict, natural [inertial] scientific method then enabled medical thinking to disentangle itself from the flowery and thorny fields of romantic Naturphilosophie and to transplant itself into the earth of natural scientific-analytic procedure. (Schrenk 1973) Virchow's cellular theory provided the supposed basis for life, without explaining it, and superseded the ancient, and by now denigrated humoral theory (because the noetic capacity to diagnose at this etheric level had waned). As such, chemistry and physics could become the basis for medicine, all the more in that medicine effectively had been reduced to surgery and chemistry, the latter due to Pasteur's ‚Äògerm theory‚Äô of disease (really an unproven hypothesis and where proven according to strict requirements of Koch's postulates, still not fully explanatory in terms of the concepts and reality of ‚Äòsusceptibility‚Äô and ‚Äòimmunity‚Äô, which contemporaries of Pasteur, such as B√©champ and Claude Bernard, sought to address). The problem of life was to be ‚Äòsolved‚Äô by Virchow's cellular hypothesis as the basis of life, which conveniently posited life within medicine without having to explain it. Thus, as N. Tsouyopoulos points out, Western ‚Äòmedicine‚Äô was effectively reduced to surgery and emergency drug treatments, possessing no basis to deal with chronic, complex disorders or diseases having rejected the dynamic approaches developed by the Brunonian orientation, as developed in general terms (physic and physiology) by R√∂schlaub/Sch√∂nlein and Saumarez, and in particular regarding disease (medicine and pathology) by Hahnemann/Lutze. As one reviewer of Tsouyopoulos' major work on romantic medicine summarized: \\"Romantic medicine was to fall into disfavour as the positivist approach from France gained ground, to the point where Karl August Wunderlich in 1859 dismissed it as mere hollow theory divorced from all empiricism, a myth that survived for nearly a century.\\" To the extent that human physiology contains a physical/chemical aspect (broken bones, impinging tumours on vital nerves, severed arteries, or severe tissue damage, significant hormonal or chemical imbalances, severe microbial invasion, and the like), a mechanic-material approach will produce effective results, witness the ‚Äòmiracles‚Äô of Western emergency medicine, but in the realm of internal ‚Äòmedicine‚Äô, there are no cures, only the suppression of symptoms or long-term disease and disorder management using chemical means, mostly synthetic, the intellect seeing no difference between a natural ‚Äòchemical‚Äô and a synthesized one. As one writer summarizes: \\"Alongside of English and French medicine of that time, whose significance was never under- appreciated, German Romantic Medicine comes off in no way as inferior or reactionary. Its contribution to overcoming the foundational crisis in medical history and for founding a scientific clinic is substantial and decisive for the whole of later developments...today, in our searching for new models and alternatives in medicine, Romantic Medicine lies closer to home than the so- called natural scientific medicine of the later 1800s and early 1900s.\\"  Contemporary use  In 2017, Kamiar-K. Rueckert introduced the term \\"Romantic Patient\\" in reference to Romantic medicine and romantic relationships to describe a patient group, which uses the defence mechanism of splitting to divide medicine into good spiritual alternative medicine and bad scientific- based medicine. In his view, these patients are on the one hand aware of their longing for an intuitively understood healing relationship, while on the other hand deny their underlying reason for this longing.

AN/APQ-120 has a long line of lineage, with its origin traced all the way back to Aero-13 FCR developed by the same company in the early 1950s. A total of half a dozen FCRs were tested and evaluated on the first 18 F-4s built, but they were soon replaced by later radars produced in great numbers, including AN/APQ-120. Aero 13 Aero-13 Fire Control System The Aero 13 FCR designed for Douglas F4D Skyray is the origin of AN/APQ-120, and it established the configuration of the airborne FCR not only for the radar families of AN/APQ-120, but also a standard for all other airborne radars to follow: Aero 13 FCR was designed as an integrated cylindrical module that could be plugged into the nose of an aircraft, instead of a set of semi-independent black boxes. Aero 1A Aero 13 did not have any capability for semi-active radar homing (SARH) air-to-air missile (AAM)s. 1A FCR was developed to add this capability by incorporating a continuous wave illuminator for SARH AAMs. This configuration of Aero 1A remained unchanged for later radars for F-4s all the way until AN/APQ-50. AN/APQ-35 Maintenance on an APQ-35 radar of a F3D-2 in Korea, 1953 The next radar to be installed on F-4 prototypes and pre-production series was AN/APQ-35, which was actually consisted of two radars: the AN/APS-21 search radar that could locate fighter-size targets at a range of 32 kilometers (20 miles), and the AN/APS-26 targeting radar, with a range of 3.2 kilometers (2 miles).APQ-35 AN/APQ-36 AN/APQ-36 is the improvement over earlier AN/APQ-35, and when AN/APQ-36 entered service on Douglas F3D Skyknight and Vought F7U Cutlass, it was the largest airborne FCR of its time. The more powerful AN/APQ-36 with large size did not have any problem being installed on F-4 prototypes, so that more powerful FCR of larger size would be developed. AN/APQ-41 The AN/APQ-41 was an improvement over the AN/APQ-36, and was designed to provide air intercept, search, to automatically track a selected target, and to supply lead angle and range information. Facilities were also provided for air-to-surface search, for beacon interrogation and response display, and for response display when used in connection with identification friend or foe (IFF).

F-4 equipped with this radar was specifically modified to meet US Navy Ferret electronic countermeasure aircraft requirement, which eventually did not materialize. AN/APQ-50 APQ-50 radar of a Douglas F4D Skyray AN/APQ-50 is the radar installed on low-rate initial production batch of F-4s, but as with earlier radars, it was not used in great numbers in comparison to later radars of the same family. The parabolic antenna is 24 inches in diameter, and in addition to providing all weather capability, AN/APQ-50 FCR also provides information on automatic firing of rockets. AN/APQ-72 AN/APQ-72 FCR is a development of AN/APQ-50, with diameter of the antenna increased by a third to 32 inches from the original 24 inches of AN/APQ-50. AN/APA-128 CW illuminator is integrated with the radar to give it a capability for radar guided AAMs. AN/APQ-72 is the first radar installed on F-4s to be built in great numbers, starting with the 19th F-4 produced. AN/APG-59 AN/APG-59 FCR is a modified AN/APQ-72 designed for the British. The main difference between AN/APG-59 and its predecessor AN/APG-72 is that AN/APG-59 had a radar dish which could be swung sideways in order to reduce the length of the aircraft to 54 feet so that it could fit on the small deck lifts of British carriers. Used in the AN/AWG-10. AN/APQ-100 AN/APQ-100 is the replacement for the AN/APQ-72, and it featured a redesigned radar scope in the rear cockpit that offered a plan position indicator (PPI) mapping display option, and adjustable range strobe for bombing. For air-to-ground missions, the radar interfaced with the inertial platform on F-4s. AN/APG-60 Modified AN/APQ-100 for the British to replace the AN/APG-59. As with AN/APG-59, AN/APG-60 also had a radar dish which could be swung sideways in order to reduce the length of the aircraft to 54 feet so that it could fit on the small deck lifts of British carriers. AN/APG-60 was later upgraded with Doppler capability during its upgrades, and integrated in the AN/AWG-11. AN/APQ-109 AN/APQ-109 is an improvement of the earlier AN/APQ-100 with an improved cockpit display able to handle TV imagery from weapons such as AGM-62 Walleye. Other significant additions included air-to-ground ranging, ground beacon identification and display capabilities. AN/APQ-109 was an improved, more reliable \\"hybrid\\" version of the AN/APQ-100 with solid-state components in the low-voltage sections. AN/APG-61 Modified AN/APQ-109 for the British to replace AN/APG-60. As with AN/APG-59/60, AN/APG-61 also had a radar dish which could be swung sideways in order to reduce the length of the aircraft to 54 feet so that it could fit on the small deck lifts of British carriers. Used in the AN/AWG-12. AN/APQ-117 AN/APQ-117 terrain following and attack radar, developed from earlier AN/APQ-109, with terrain following capability added.APQ-117 A fully solid-state radar developed from AN/APQ-117, the AN/APQ-120 radar was much more compact than its predecessors, allowing it to fit into the nose along with the cannon, and the radar was later integrated into AN/AWG-14. AN/AWG-10 AN/AWG-10 with AN/APG-59 AN/AWG is defined by the Joint Electronics Type Designation System (JETDS) and stands for (A/N) Army/Navy (A) Piloted Aircraft (W) Armament (G) Fire Control. AN/APG-59 was the first FCR integrated into AN/AWG-10, which developed into two more versions, A and B. The original AN/AWG-10 can detect an aerial target with 5 square meters radar cross section more than 100 kilometers away. AN/AWG-10A is a development of the original AN/AWG-10, with great improvement in reliability and maintainability by replacing the original transmitter in AN/AWG-10 by a solid state unit whose only tube was a klystron power amplifier. Adding a digital computer allowed much more effective missile launch equations. AN/AWG-10A also incorporated a new servoed optical sight. There were also additions of new modes such as continuously displayed impact point mode, freeze displayed impact mode, and computer released visual mode. AN/AWG-10B was further digitized version of AN/AWG-10/10A but retained many analog circuits. A key AVC (avionics change) was the replacement of the unreliable Doppler Spectrum Analyzer (DSA) with a reliable Digital Spectrum Processor (DSP) which also increased accuracy when operating in doppler mode.AWG-10 AN/AWG-11 AN/AWG-11 was a British AN/AWG-10 license-built by Ferranti. The radar used was AN/APG-60, and AN/AWG-11 is a slightly modified AN/AWG-10 in that it's compatible with AGM-12 Bullpup and WE.177, so that British F-4s can perform nuclear strike missions if required. AN/AWG-12 AN/AWG-12 was an improved AN/AWG-11 built by Ferranti with AN/APG-61 FCR. The main difference between AN/AWG-11 and AN/AWG-12 is that the latter has a better ground mapping mode, and it also can control a belly mounted SUU-23/A Vulcan. AN/AWG-12 finally retired in 1992 when the last F-4s in British service retired, and during its service life, it was upgraded with improvements of the AN/AWG-10A/B. AN/AWG-14 AN/AWG-14 is the final member of the lineage of this radar family, and it is a fully digitized upgrade of the AWG seriesAWG-14 incorporating AN/APQ-120. The open architecture and modular design enable AWG-14 to accommodate different radars, such as AN/APG-65, AN/APG-66, AN/APG-76, Elta EL/M-2011/2021 and EL/M-2032.

He is currently the musical director for Nicki Minaj and Justin Timberlake. Adam has also directed and played in performances with a star-studded list of cliental that includes Jay-Z, Kanye West, Eminem, Janet Jackson, Dr. Dre, The Jonas Brothers, The Roots, Ms.Marilyn Marshall, Al Green, The Isley Brothers, Angie Stone, Mike Posner, Steve Tirpak, Al Jarreau, Maroon 5, Demi Lovato, and Jill Scott. Early years Adam began his musical journey playing drums at the age of 4 at El Bethel church on Euclid Avenue in Trenton, NJ. With his father serving as the church organist, and his mother singing in the choir, Adam Blackstone has said he first fell in love with music at church. Though Adam had his sights set on being a drummer, Adam began playing bass in the 3rd grade after his music teacher suggested Adam try it out. Adam then started playing upright bass in the 9th grade, in order to join his Willingboro high school jazz band. Adam Blackstone later on earned a full scholarship to the University of the Arts in Philadelphia thanks to his musical abilities. It was there that Adam studied contemporary Jazz and really honed in and perfected his bass playing and arranging skills. Career Adam Blackstone began his career as a session musician in the Philadelphia. After becoming widely known in the area for his round, distinct tone, Adam caught the attention of drummer and producer Questlove of the well known Hip hop / Soul group, The Roots. His first big live show was at age 21 with Jay Z on his Fade to Black show at Madison Square Garden in November 2003. This show, along with Dave Chappelle's Block Party, were both filmed and made into popular documentaries that sold extremely well, and helped put Blackstone on the map. As Adam progressed, Adam became more well known among artists and labels for his tenacity, leadership skills, and hard work. Adam has since worked with and for several other A-list artists, providing all Adam can to not only meet, but exceed his clients standards. In 2012, Adam was the music director and bassist for pop superstar Rihanna on her 777 Tour, which involved playing in 7 countries in 7 consecutive days. Following his work with the popular American rock band Maroon 5, Adam Blackstone was also featured as an adviser to coach Adam Levine during NBC's season one of The Voice. In 2014, Adam Blackstone was recruited by Eminem for his comeback show after a 3-year hiatus at the famed Austin City Limits Music Festival.

A 3-dimensional anaglyph constructed from Cassini VIMS images shows a hilly crater floor with a prominent but topographically low central peak complex. While regular radial secondaries occur outside of the continuous ejecta blanket associated with the bright rays, clusters of numerous small craters could be identified in the eastern part of the crater floor and in the adjacent continuous ejecta.

Establishment In the early 1990s, Jim Archer (Chairman of Planning Systems Ltd. and Planning Project Management Ltd.) recognized rubbish as a never-ending resource for the production of energy if processed responsibly. With Mumo Musuva (Managing Director of Planning Systems Services Ltd.) he began to develop designs for a very simple, inexpensive rubbish burner which could also serve as a stove for cooking. With initial seed capital of US $10,000 through UNEP and coupled with funding from other institutions, the first prototype model of the Community Cooker was constructed in 2008 in one of Africa‚Äôs largest slums, Kibera. There are three Community Cookers in low-income areas in Kenya (including Kibera) and one at Planning Systems used for Research and Development purposes. In November 2010 the Community Cooker Foundation was created. The foundation now consists of a board of trustees, a secretariat and a committee who make decisions about future Community Cooker developments. The foundation also manages a wide range of volunteers, who assist in promoting the Community Cooker.\\"http://www.communitycooker.or.ke/about.html\\"  Background  VISION To develop economically sustainable energy solutions for a cleaner environment. MISSION Community Cooker Foundation works to transform environmental waste into energy for improved livelihoods and healthier communities. The Community Cooker is a sustainable Community Energy System currently operating in three informal settlements in Kenya; Laini Saba Village in Kibera, Karagita in Naivasha and Kawangware, Nairobi. This waste to energy technology has three complementary functions: 1) To address sanitation, health and aesthetic issues associated with the growing mounds of rubbish in informal settlements. 2) To provide communities with alternatives to charcoal, firewood and paraffin for cooking meals and boiling water. 3) To act as a platform from which Community Based Organizations (CBO‚Äôs) and institutions can run cost effective income generating activities.\\"http://www.communitycooker.or.ke/about.html\\"  The Issues  Rubbish is everywhere, and yet Local Authorities of developing nations are less and less inclined to collect and seldom dispose of responsibly, especially in low-income areas. This results in: Pollution of groundwater and rivers Pollution of the food chain, as domestic animals often eat from refuse heaps Breeding grounds for malarial mosquitoes, flies and rats Methane gas emissions from heaps of rotting rubbish General degradation of the natural environment and the quality of all forms of life in rubbish strewn areas Decline in property values due to the degradation of the environment and health \\"http://www.communitycooker.or.ke/about.html\\" More than 80 percent of Kenya‚Äôs urban dwellers, many of whom live in poor, informal settlements, use charcoal made from wood as their primary source of energy, according to government statistics. On average, burning 2 kg of dry wood emits 1 kg of stored carbon. Environmental Resource Management (ERM), an international consultancy, has calculated that, if operated 24 hours a day, the Community Cooker could save the calorific heat equivalent of burning about 3,000 mature trees over one year. The Community Cooker offers resourceful slum dwellers a fuel source that is far less expensive than wood fuel, charcoal, gas or kerosene.\\"http://www.trust.org/item/?map=garbage-fed-community-cooker-cuts- wood-use-energy-costs\\"  The Cooker  The Community Cooker is a simple machine and can be built almost anywhere. Repairs and maintenance can be carried out by members of the community. The Community Cooker represents a low technology, low cost and socially inclusive vision for change, engaging communities to participate in collecting rubbish to exchange for energy to cook food and heat water. Once set up, it has minimal operating expenses and can run for indefinite periods of time at minimal cost. While currently designed for cooking, the potential to convert energy into alternative uses exists, including activities such as brick and pottery baking, hot water institutions, soft metals smelting and generating electricity. The Community Cooker requires only rubbish and small droplets of water and disused engine oil to function at combustion temperatures of over 850 degrees Celsius, exceeding the WHO minimum standards for incineration in developing countries. With a total cooking surface of 1.7 sq. metres, including 8 hobs and two 18 cubic metre ovens for baking, the technology is designed to operate 24 hours a day. Over a two-hour period, the Community Cooker can cook 77 liters of food and heat 800 liters of water. 2,100 residents can be served over a 12-hour period.\\"http://www.communitycooker.or.ke/cooker.html\\" How it Works? ''' 1) Rubbish collection: A community, or specific groups or individuals collect rubbish in baskets, bags and wheelbarrows. 2) Sorting Rubbish: Rubbish is deposited and sorted on the lowest of the three stepped steel welded mesh racks. Rubbish sorters receive training in solid waste management to ensure that non-combustible materials and material which create harmful fumes are intercepted and removed, such as torch batteries, glass and rubber. Biodegradable scraps that fall through become compost manure. The remaining rubbish such as plastic bags, packaging, food scraps and even flying toilets, are placed on the second tiered rack for drying. Dry materials are shovelled down the chute to the firebox. 3) Incineration: Two simple taps are the only moving controls on the cooker: one tap controls a drip flow of recycled sump oil (discarded oil from vehicles) and one tap controls a drip flow of water. A drop of each, in equal amounts, falls onto the super-heated steel plate of the firebox, where the water vaporizes and boosts the flames, thereby increasing the temperature from about 250 degrees Celsius to more than 800 degrees Celsius (the World Health Organisation (WHO) minimum burning standard for incinerators in developing countries). As the firebox gets hotter, the network of steel pipes that pass around the cooker produce hot water. As the rubbish burns, heat is distributed under 8 cooking plates on the top of the Cooker and 2 ovens in the sides of the Cooker. 4) Using rubbish as fuel: The cooker can be used 24/7 by individuals or community groups to cook food for their own use or as an income generating activity. The cooker has a cooking surface of 1.7 square meters, two large ovens for baking, and storage capacity for heating 800 litres of water at any given time. Each oven is large enough to bake up to 10 loaves of bread at one time, or roast an entire goat. 5) Cleaner waste: A ten metre tall chimney rises out of the combustion chamber and above the neighbourhood rooftops. Because the flames are boosted by the regulated mixture of sump oil and water, the firebox and combustion chamber achieves ninety-nine percent combustion efficiency (Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale Surveillance Kenya, Environmental Measures Report NRB1152-0094, 21 March 2011). As a result, the chimney emits a nearly odourless white vapour when the stove is in use 6) Maintenance: Once all the rubbish in the combustion chamber has been burned and the users are ready to turn off the Cooker, one simply turns off the oil and water drip feed and stops feeding the rubbish through the chute. At the end of a burn, the operator should use a pipe or shovel to remove the ash below the firebox and combustion chamber. The ash can be used for block making.\\"http://www.communitycooker.or.ke/cooker.html\\" Awards and recognition The Community Cooker Foundation has spread the idea of Community Cooker and has received multiple international awards and recognitions: 1) Sustainia Copenhagen, Demark April 15, 2013 Shortlisted for the 2013 edition of Sustainia 100\\"http://www.communitycooker.or.ke/recognition.html\\" 2) The FT ArcelorMittal Boldness in Business Awards London March 20, 2013 Shortlisted for the FT ArcelorMittal Boldness in Business Awards in the Corporate Responsibility/Environment category.\\"http://www.communitycooker.or.ke/recognition.html\\" 3) The Icon Awards 2012 December 6, 2012 The Community Cooker is awarded; The Most Socially Responsible Design of the Year Award\\"http://www.communitycooker.or.ke/recognition.html\\" 4) FT/Citi Ingenuity Awards Urban Ideas in Action New York December 5, 2012 The Community Cooker was awarded; Energy - Urban Ingenuity Ideas in Action winner, with the Metropolitan Government of Tokyo as runner up The Overall Global Leader Ahead of GSK, College Possible (A University in USA) and JC Decaux ‚Äì Vƒólib with the Paris Bureau of Transport & City of Huston as runners up.\\"http://www.communitycooker.or.ke/recognition.html\\" 5) World Design Impact Prize Finland February 2, 2012 The Community Cooker was awarded the Inaugural World Design Impact Prize.\\"http://www.communitycooker.or.ke/recognition.html\\" 6) British Expertise Awards London U.K. November 2011 Open to all British registered consultants worldwide, the Community Cooker won the Environmental Impact Award.\\"http://www.communitycooker.or.ke/recognition.html\\" 7) Smithsonian Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Socially Responsible Design New York City, January 2011 The Community Cooker was showcased at the United Nations Headquarters from October 15, 2011 until January 9, 2012 as part of the Smithsonian‚Äôs Design with the Other 90%: CITIES exhibition.

She was the wife of Joshua Patten, captain of the merchant clipper ship Neptune‚Äôs Car. The ship was bound around Cape Horn from New York towards San Francisco when Joshua Patten collapsed from fatigue in 1856. His wife took command for 56 days, faced down a mutiny, and successfully managed to navigate the clipper ship into San Francisco. At the time she was 19 years old and pregnant with her first child.http://www.newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/mary-patten-19-pregnant- takes-command-clipper-ship-1856/  Early life and first voyage  Hong Kong harbor Mary Ann Brown was born in Chelsea, Massachusetts in 1837 to George and Elizabeth Brown. She married a young captain named Joshua Adams Patten in Boston on April 1, 1853 just before her 16th birthday. In 1855 Captain Patten was offered the command of a clipper ship named Neptune‚Äôs Car. Patten was hesitant to leave his wife for so long so early in their marriage, and so the ship‚Äôs owners granted permission for her to accompany him. Neptune‚Äôs Car was launched in 1853 and by 1855 the vessel had already developed a reputation for speed. It was 216 feet long and weighed 1,617 tons. According to the New York Herald, Patten was a last minute replacement for the ship‚Äôs previous captain, who had taken ill shortly before the vessel was set to travel the world. The Herald claims that Joshua and Mary Patten were aboard Neptune‚Äôs Car preparing to leave the dock only twelve hours after they first received the offer. For the next 17 months they sailed to San Francisco, China, London, and back to New York. Mary passed the time learning navigation and assisting Joshua with his duties as captain.  Husband's collapse and attempted mutiny  The ship departed from New York for San Francisco on July 1, 1856 along with two other clipper ships, the Intrepid and Romance of the Seas. This made speed a greater priority than usual, as it was common practice to place bets on which vessel would arrive first. Neptune‚Äôs Car was at the foot of Cape Horn when Joshua Patten developed tuberculosis and lapsed into a coma. Under usual circumstances the first mate would take command. However earlier in the voyage Captain Patten had caught him sleeping on watch and losing valuable time by leaving sails reefed. The mate had likely placed bets on one of Neptune‚Äôs Car‚Äôs competitors, and so Captain Patten had confined him to his cabin. The second mate was illiterate and unable to navigate, which left Mary Patten the most qualified person on board to bring the ship safely into port. The former first mate wrote Patten a letter warning her of the challenges ahead and imploring her to reinstate him, but she replied that if her husband hadn‚Äôt trusted him as a mate she couldn't trust him as a captain.\\"A Wife Worth Having\\". New York Daily Times, January 21, 1857, page 3 He then attempted to incite a mutiny by trying to convince the crew that they would be better off putting into the nearby port of Valparaisorather than continuing on to San Francisco. Patten knew that putting into port in South America would mean a loss of crew and quite possibly cargo. She responded by making an appeal to the crew, and in the end won their unanimous support. Patten later claimed that she didn‚Äôt change her clothes for 50 days, instead dedicating her free time to studying medicine and caring for her husband, who had been struck blind by the time they passed Valparaiso. She is credited with keeping him alive during the voyage although he never fully recovered his health.  Arrival in San Francisco and return northeast  When Neptune‚Äôs Car arrived at San Francisco Harbor Mary Patten rejected an offer to await a pilot to navigate the clipper ship into port, and instead took the helm herself. Despite all of Neptune‚Äôs Car‚Äôs tribulations, the clipper ship still arrived in San Francisco second, beating the Intrepid. The ship's insurers, recognizing that Mary Patten had saved them thousands of dollars, rewarded her with one thousand dollars in February 1857. In a letter responding to the gift, she said that she performed \\"only the plain duty of a wife.\\" \\"Mrs. Patten and the Insurance Companies\\". New York Daily Times, March 7, 1857, page 5 Joshua Patten survived the journey back to New York on the steamer George Law and safely returned to Boston with his wife. There Mary gave birth to a son whom she named Joshua. Captain Patten died in July 1857, less than a year after his last voyage.New York Daily Times, Jul 31, 1857, page 2 Mary Ann Brown Patten was given $1,399 from a fund for her relief set up by the Boston Courier.\\"Personal\\".

At the age of 25, she was struck and killed by two French nationals, Claude Khayat (dual French-Israeli national) and Eric Robic, who were driving a black BMW sports utility vehicle on September 16, 2011 in Tel Aviv. The two left the accident scene and fled to France to avoid criminal prosecution, where they accepted responsibility for the crime and expressed their regret. The Israeli and French authorities were in close communication with each other on how to proceed, as the French law of extradition, like Israel's, does not allow extradition of nationals, except to countries of the European Union, to bring them to justice. In July 2012, after an official complaint from the Zeitouni family, France launched a criminal investigation into the death of Lee Zeitouni that led to Khayat and Robic being charged for homicide, failure to assist a person in danger and unlawful escape to avoid responsibility. In December 2014 Eric Robic, the driver of the car that hit Zeitouni, was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to 5 years in prison. Passenger Claude Khayat was found guilty of deliberately failing to provide assistance to a person in danger and was sentenced to 15 months. Early life Lee Zeitouni was born in Kibbutz Neve Ur in 1986, and was the sibling of two brothers and a sister. At the time of her death, Zeitouni was a Pilates instructor. Death On September 16, 2011, Zeitouni was heading to a gym to teach a class when a black BMW sports utility vehicle with two occupants struck her on Pinkhas Street at 6:45 A.M. The impact sent Zeitouni flying onto the oncoming lane, where a second vehicle struck and instantly killed her. The two French nationals in the BMW, Eric Robic, 37, a businessman who frequently spends time in Israel, and Claude Khayat (who has dual French-Israeli nationality), a neighbor and close friend of Robic, escaped the scene and drove through red lights. They hid the car in the parking lot of the building they lived in on Maze Street in Tel Aviv, and fled the country. Thousands of people gathered for Zeitouni's funeral in her hometown of Kibbutz Neve Ur on September 18, 2011. Investigation Police officials conducted a nationwide search, and traced the vehicle to Eric Robic. Police discovered his apartment to be empty, since he quickly escaped to France together with Khayat. Detectives determined that Robic and Khayat had been drinking in Tel Aviv and Ramat Gan, and left a bar at around 6 A.M. on the day that Zeitouni was killed. Soon after, Israeli police asked Interpol for assistance in bringing the French tourists into custody, and an international arrest warrant was issued for Robic and Khayat. =Statements by suspects= In an interview with an Israeli television channel on September 22, 2011, Khayat said, ‚ÄúWe want to be in Israel, to go to the family and explain how much it hurts us too. But what can we do today? We killed a Jewish woman who was 25. For us this is the end of the world... We didn‚Äôt see her at all. If I would have seen her, I would have pressed on the brakes. But I saw her only when she was hit.\\" On October 23, 2011, Khayat and Robic stated that they spoke to an Israeli attorney who specializes in traffic accidents, and requested that the attorney begin discussions with state prosecutors to explore their options for a plea bargain or a specific sentence. In December 2011, the two suspects stated that they do not plan to return to Israel to face justice, but are determined to stay in France. One of their lawyers stated that it was possible that the Israeli authorities would allow the trial to take place in France, but stated that there was still a \\"power struggle\\" between the French and Israeli authorities at the moment. =Speeding by suspect= In late December 2011, Claude Khayat was caught driving at a speed of 156 kilometers per hour (nearly 100 mph) in France, and was released immediately after paying a fine for speeding. Zeitouni's boyfriend said \\"The fact that Claude Khayat was caught speeding in his new Audi A8 proves that France has become a sanctuary for fugitives... We expect the authorities in Israel to have them extradited and bring them to justice.\\" =Israel-France Cooperation= On September 18, a short while after the incident, Israel's State Attorney's Office announced that the authorities were communicating with their French counterparts regarding Zeitouni and the French tourists involved in the hit-and-run. Because Israel and France do not have an extradition treaty, French laws make it difficult, if not impossible, to bring the two French tourists to Israel for trial unless they agree voluntarily. According to the French prosecutor in the case, \\"French law does not allow the extradition of French citizens ‚Äì there are no exceptions.\\" If the two were convicted in France, they would face a minimal sentence, with a maximum of 10 years as opposed to 14 years in Israel. On September 21, 2011, Christophe Bigot, the French ambassador to Israel, visited Zeitouni's family, who demanded that he would act to extradite Robic and to Israel for a trial. Bigot responded that the French \\"will make an effort to return the two boys to Israel.\\" Bigot confirmed that there was close cooperation between the Israeli and French law enforcement officials, and that both Israel and France were dedicated to bringing the suspects to justice. On the same day, approximately 200 protestors outside the French embassy in Tel Aviv demanded that Robic and Khayat would be extradited to Israel. In late December 2011, Carla Bruni, the wife of then French President Nicolas Sarkozy, wrote a personal letter to Zeitouni's mother, Kate, in which she shared her condolences and sorrow. Bruni stated that France received Israel's request to investigate the matter and a prosecutor was appointed and a judge has taken the lead of the investigation. Bruni also wrote that Israeli investigators recently visited Paris and the French authorities conveyeda commitment to coordinate all their activities. In January 2012, Christophe Bigot stated before a Knesset panel that justice would be served in the case of Lee Zeitouni, but there was little chance that the two would be extradited to Israel from France. Bigot stated, \\"There is no indifference in France, we are ready to judge them and we want to judge them, we don‚Äôt see it any other way.\\" He also emphasized close cooperation between Israeli and French authorities in regards to the case. =Campaign to extradite suspects= Roy Peled, Zeitouni's fianc√©, created the organization 'Justice for Lee' to raise awareness about Zeitouni and achieve justice for her. Peled has stated, \\"I am not a lawyer and I do not care if there is a legal agreement or not, all I know is that justice must be found and we need to stop the next murder... Lee will never come back to me.\\" Peled is also concerned that foreign nationals who commit crimes in Israel manage to leave with few consequences, and stated that this is \\"very dangerous.\\" In late November 2011, activists in a group working to extradite Khayat and Robic from France to Israel handed out flyers at Ben-Gurion International Airport to passengers arriving from France. The flyers had the slogan \\"license to kill\\" written on them, and the group hoped to appeal to the French passengers, many of whom are Jewish, to assist in extraditing them from France. =French investigation and trial= In July 2012, Zeitouni's family filed a complaint in France against Robic and Khayat, after the family unsuccessfully tried to extradite the two to Israel. The French newspaper Le Figaro dedicated its headline to the story, and explained that the two suspects enjoyed a legal loophole that allowed them to remain free. The French authorities couldn't act without a complaint, while the Israeli authorities couldn't act without an extradition. According to the newspaper, \\"The move seals the deal\\" and Robic and Khayat would be tried in France. On July 11, 2012, France launched a criminal investigation into the death of Lee Zeitouni. On December 3, 2014, the driver of the car that hit Lee Zeitouni, Eric Robic, was found guilty of manslaughter, in coincidence with deliberately failing to provide assistance to a person in danger (\\"non-assistance √† personne en danger\\") and sentenced to 5 years in prison by the criminal court (tribunal correctionnel) in Paris. Passenger Claude Khayat was found guilty of deliberately failing to provide assistance to a person in danger and was sentenced to 15 months in prison.http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash- actu/2014/12/03/97001-20141203FILWWW00418-affaire-zeitouni-le-conducteur-eric- robic-ecope-de-5-ans-ferme.php References Israeli Jews 1986 births 2011 deaths Road incident deaths in Israel 2011 in Israel 2011 in France ","title":"Lee Zeitouni affair"},{"id":"36456734","text":"Kalateh-ye Gol (, also Romanized as KalƒÅteh-ye Gol) is a village in Shirin Darreh Rural District, in the Central District of Quchan County, Razavi Khorasan Province, Iran.

This species grows to in total length and is of minor importance to local fisheries, particularly during grunion runs in which the fish beach themselves to lay their eggs and are easily taken. Description The California grunion is a long, slender fish with a deeply forked tail. The dorsal fin is in two parts and has five to seven spines and nine to ten soft rays. The origin of the anal fin is immediately below the first dorsal fin, and this fin has twenty-one to twenty-four soft rays. The fish grows to a maximum length of . It is greenish above and silvery below. There is a blue patch on the cheek and a silvery-blue lateral stripe along the side. Distribution This species is endemic to the eastern Pacific Ocean. Its range extends from Monterey Bay southwards to Baja California, but it is uncommon north of Point Conception. It is also found in the Gulf of California. Its depth range is from the sea surface down to about . Breeding Breeding takes place between about March and August and happens on the second, third and fourth nights following the full moon, a little while after the tide has peaked. The fish swim towards a sandy beach and are carried up the shore by the advancing waves. Each female then digs herself into the sand tail first and lays a clutch of eggs in the wet sand. Several males may attempt to mate with one female, curling around her while they shed their milt, after which they get washed back to the sea. The female finishes laying her eggs, emerges from the sand and moves down the beach, the whole process usually taking half minute or so. The eggs remain buried in the sand until the next series of spring tides following the new moon a fortnight later. In the laboratory it has been shown that the eggs develop and are ready to hatch after about ten days, but only actually hatch after a period of agitation, as might occur when waves were pounding the sand in which they were buried and scouring away the sand covering them. By the time this happens in the wild, a fortnight after the eggs were laid, the female fish will have another batch of mature eggs, and may deposit these eggs in a similar manner at night during the exceptionally high tides associated with the new moon. Although some other fish species leave their eggs in locations that dry out (a few, such as plainfin midshipman, may even remain on land with the eggs during low tide) or on plants above the water (splash tetras), jumping onto land en masse to spawn is unique to the two grunions, capelin and grass puffer.Roland, T. (9 April 2010). Running with the Grunion. The Independent. Retrieved 20 August 2016.Martin, K.L.M. (2014). Beach-Spawning Fishes: Reproduction in an Endangered Ecosystem. CRC Press. . Feeding The fish feed on plankton such as copepods. They are preyed on by California halibut, rock bass, white croakers and other large predators. Humans catch them for food or use them as bait. The eggs are at risk from shore birds such as the whimbrel and the marbled godwit, which probe the sand with their beaks. The eggs are also sought by sandworms, ground squirrels, a species of isopod, and certain beetles and flies.

Working in the Boasian tradition of American Cultural Anthropology, he adopted critical stances of several ideas of his fellow Boasians, and became known as an original and critical thinker, pioneering several ideas that later became widely accepted within anthropology. Biography Like many anthropologists in the United States at the time, Lesser was Jewish. He studied at Columbia University. As an undergraduate he studied philosophy with John Dewey and did his graduate studies in Anthropology with Franz Boas. His first wife was Gene Weltfish, a fellow anthropologist and Caddoanist. He studied the culture and history of the Pawnee people and other Plains Indians, specializing in the study of kinship among the Siouan peoples. His 1933 work on the Ghost dance among the Pawnee was the first anthropological study of a cultural revitalization movement. Lesser was a critic of the psychological anthropology of Ruth Benedict preferring a more historicizing mode of explanation of cultural phenomena. His focus on history also led him to criticize the ahistorical structural functionalism of Radcliffe-Brown. In 1939 Lesser publicly broke with the Boasian historical particularism, arguing that it is possible to demonstrate general rules of cultural evolution. During World War II he worked as a social science analyst for the government and subsequently spent a number of years directing the Association of American Indian Affairs, and serving on the National Research Council. In 1947 along with 10 coworkers he was terminated from the State Department because of his political views, but he successfully defended himself in court and received an apology from the government and had his record cleared. Besides his contribution to Plains ethnography, Lesser is well known for his documentation of the Kitsai language. Following Boas, he was also among the first anthropologists to reject the notion of Race as a valid biological construct. In 1935 he wrote, \\"\\"We do not ask whether blond horses are smarter than black ones, because we have no a priori prejudice against skin color in horses.... Race attitudes, race theories and race problems must be reduced to the place where they belong, the realm of social phenomena\\" (Lesser 1935-36:49).\\" He held teaching positions at Columbia University, Brooklyn College, and Brandeis University before ending his career at Hofstra University, where he was chair of the department of anthropology and sociology from 1960 to 1965. Through his career he taught mostly undergraduates and had no doctoral students of his own. Select publications *1928. Bibliography of American Folklore. Journal of American Folk-lore 41:1-60. *1929.

Puerto Rican singer/songwriter Roy Brown popularized it by adapting it to song. It was first featured on the album √Årboles, from Brown and Cuban singer Silvio Rodr√≠guez and became one of Brown's most popular songs. Song history On the booklet of Roy Brown's hits album Colecci√≥n, he writes that the song \\"could've never been\\". Brown writes that in the late 70s, Corretjer handed him the lyrics, which he intended to be d√©cimas, to see if Roy could come up with something. Brown, who at the time was moving to New York City, forgot about them. Several years later, when Corretjer died, Brown started looking for the d√©cimas, but had a hard time finding them. A year later, Brown finally found them and says the music came \\"like a yank\\". However, he broke his finger playing basketball so he was unable to play it for a year.[Roy Brown's Colecci√≥n booklet] In 1987, he finally recorded it for the album √Årboles. Lyrical interpretation The song tells the story of a fictional character who recalls his heritage, product of the Puerto Rican migration to New York. He tells of his parents: a working-class father from Las Mar√≠as and an aspiring singer from Aguadilla, and how they migrated to the United States looking for better opportunities, resulting in his conception and birth on the mainland. Despite their aspirations, the song tells of the struggles of Puerto Rican immigrants in the States, which results in the death of his father and the mother's failed career. The song continues with the protagonist becoming proud of his Puerto Rican heritage, thanks to the upbringing of his grandfather. This leads him to proclaim himself as Puerto Rican, regardless of his birthplace. In the conclusion of the song, the protagonist declares himself that he would be \\"borincano\\" even if he was born on the Moon. This last line is what gives the title to the song.Boricua en la luna on Boricua PoetryBoricua en la luna on Antolog√≠a de poes√≠a; Corretjer, Juan Antonio (1980, p. 120) The song has become a symbol of national pride among some Puerto Ricans. The newspaper Primera Hora even used the title of the poem/song for a recurring series of articles on notable Puerto Ricans that have moved to the United States and other parts of the world. Other versions and covers \\"Boricua en la Luna\\" has become one of Roy Brown's most popular songs. Because of this, the song is featured on several other albums. The song appears on the live album Distancias en Vivo and in the greatest hits album Colecci√≥n. In the mid-90s, Puerto Rican rock band Fiel a la Vega began covering the song during their live presentations. In July 1997, they recorded a live version of the song during their acoustic concert. In it, lead singer Tito Auger shares the vocals with Roy Brown himself. When they released the concert album, El Concierto Ac√∫stico, \\"Boricua en la Luna\\" was one of the singles promoted.Boricua en la Luna on YouTube The next year, their version of the song received a Tu M√∫sica Award for Song of the Year. The song has continued to be a staple of the band during their live shows. In 1998, Fiel a la Vega joined local bands Haciendo Punto en Otro Son and Moliendo Vidrio for a series of concerts entitled Un Junte para la Historia. After three separate sets from each band, the three took the stage together for one last set. The last song from the concert was \\"Boricua en la Luna\\".

It was written in 1694, and is one of a series of odes in honour of the birthday of Queen Mary II of England.\\"Come ye sons of art\\", The Oxford Dictionary of Music. Oxford University Press (). The text of the ode is often attributed to Nahum Tate, who was poet laureate at the time. Background and history of the work As a court composer, Purcell was given the task of composing odes for the birthday of Queen Mary. Come, Ye Sons of Art, written for performance in April 1694, was the sixth and final ode: Queen Mary died at the end of that year. 20th-century performances included the inaugural concert of the BBC Third Programme (the forerunner of Radio 3) in 1946. Scoring and structure The ode is scored for 2 recorders, 2 oboes, 2 trumpets, timpani, strings, basso continuo and a choir with soprano, alto/countertenor, and bass soloists. It is possible that this instrumentation reflects additions by an 18th century editor. Music Purcell begins the ode with a symphony or overture consisting of three movements: a largo followed by a fugal canzona and an adagio. It seems that Purcell later rewrote the opening symphony and incorporated it into his opera The Indian Queen. The opening chorus is on the words \\"Come, Ye sons of Art,\\" and serves as the introduction to the text. For the countertenor duet Sound the Trumpet, instead of using actual trumpets, Purcell choose to incorporate a two-bar modulating ground bass as the singers imitate the sound of trumpets. The day that such a blessing gave is intended to be a prayer for the day to be of jubilation. This joy is displayed in the rest of the composition. Publication One of the numbers, Strike the Viol, was published in Orpheus Britannicus. The rest of the work remained unpublished. \\"The earliest surviving complete source is a manuscript score signed by one ‚ÄòRob[er]t Pindar‚Äô, and dated 1765‚Äîsome seventy years after Purcell‚Äôs death.\\"Rebecca Herissone. ed. Come ye Sons of Arts. London: Stainer & Bell, 2010. A new performance edition was published by Stainer & Bell in 2010, edited by Rebecca Herissone. This edition is based on a comparison of Come Ye Sons of Art with manuscripts of other Odes written by Purcell which reveal instrumental and editorial changes made by Pindar. Such comparisons led to the removal of eighteenth-century \\"enhancement\\". Dr. Herissone retains the overture, but suggests that Pindar may have incorporated this music from The Indian Queen into Come Ye Sons of Art. Herissone also points out that the \\"opening solo quite clearly begins ‚ÄòCome, ye sons of arts‚Äô, in the plural, not ‚ÄòCome, ye sons of art‚Äô as in Pindar‚Äôs score, so the decision has been taken in the edition to follow the text as given in Purcell‚Äôs autograph.\\" It appears the original title was 'Come, ye sons of arts.'

The building has been refurbished and stands as part of Pancho Villa State Park. After the Second World War, a one-story barracks (used by the personnel assigned to the U.S. Army's Air Base Columbus during the War) was moved to the southwest corner of the intersection of Route 11 (the Deming-Palomas road) and Route 9 (the Columbus-Hachita road). The first two rooms of this building were used by the U.S. Immigration Service Inspectors to inspect aliens who were applying for lawful admission to the United States and to provide administrative workspace for the Immigration Service and the Border Patrol. In 1946, the remainder of the building was converted into living accommodations for one of the Inspectors and his family. Three Inspectors were assigned to the office which was open, initially from 8:00 am to 8:00 pm and later from 6:00 am to 10:00 pm. When the Pancho Villa State Park was opened next to the site, a new Immigration/Customs building was built three miles south at the border and the former office building/residence became a town library and public meeting room.

Plot Ipah lives alone with her father, Rengga. The family is very poor and lives in the garbage dumps of Jakarta. Although Ipah wants to go to school, Rengga does not allow her. While Rengga works as a trash scavenger, Ipah takes several jobs and pays for her own schooling, helped by neighbours. Eventually Rengga relents, allowing Ipah to finish her schooling, and she goes on to become a teacher. Production Alang-Alang was directed by Teguh Karya, a multi-award winning filmmaker known for his films with social messages. It was sponsored by the Family Planning Coordination Board (, or BKKBN), and the Johns Hopkins University Population Communication Services (JHU/PCS). These organisations, dedicated towards family planning and welfare, considered the message of education important to their goals. Karya, who had previously worked with the BKKBN on Trilogi Khatulistiwa (The Equatorial Trilogy), adopted several aspects suggested by the Board, including the death of a woman after having too many children. Filming began in July 1994. Themes Karya and his sponsors had worked to explicitly make family planning and population the central themes. However, in a follow-up survey by JHU/PCS viewers reported seeing themes of education for women, street children's issues, anti-smoking, and intergenerational discourse. Karya initially described the series as \\"on a little girl who wants a better future\\". Release and reception Alang-Alang was broadcast in December 1994 on SCTV and viewed by 25-30 per cent of the country's television audience. Initially planned to be shown on the state owned TVRI, it was the first drama with a social message broadcast on SCTV. It sparked several polemics. According to the follow-up survey by JHU/PCS, families used the characters from Alang-Alang to discuss their own situation and relationships. For his role in the series, Zainal Abidin Domba won a Vidia Award for best supporting actor. Together with the Pakistani series Nijaat, Alang-Alang led to further collaborations between JHU/PCS and filmmakers.

In 2001, Ross and Fahroo announced the covector mapping principle, first, as a special result in pseudospectral optimal control, and later as a general result in optimal control. This principle was based on the Ross‚ÄìFahroo lemma which proves that dualization and discretization are not necessarily commutative operations and that certain steps must be taken to promote commutation. When discretization is commutative with dualization, then, under appropriate conditions, Pontryagin's minimum principle emerges as a consequence of the convergence of the discretization. Together with F. Fahroo, W. Kang and Q. Gong, Ross proved a series of results on the convergence of pseudospectral discretizations of optimal control problems.W. Kang, I. M. Ross, Q. Gong, Pseudospectral optimal control and its convergence theorems, Analysis and Design of Nonlinear Control Systems, Springer, pp. 109‚Äì124, 2008. Ross and his coworkers showed that the Legendre and Chebyshev pseudospectral discretizations converge to an optimal solution of a problem under the mild condition of boundedness of variations. Software contributions In 2001, Ross created DIDO, a software package for solving optimal control problems. Powered by pseudospectral methods, Ross created a user-friendly set of objects that required no knowledge of his theory to run DIDO. This was used in work on pseudospectral methods for solving optimal control problems.Q. Gong, W. Kang, N. Bedrossian, F. Fahroo, P. Sekhavat and K.

Formed in June 1940 from surplus Australian troops who had been sent to the United Kingdom shortly after the Fall of France, the battalion was originally designated the \\"71st Battalion\\", before being redesignated. After completing training in the United Kingdom, the 2/32nd served in North Africa in 1941‚Äì1942 as part of the 25th Brigade, which was assigned to the 9th Division, before being assigned to the 24th Brigade. In early 1943, the battalion returned to Australia and later took part in campaigns against the Japanese in New Guinea in 1943‚Äì1944 around Lae and on the Huon Peninsula, and in Borneo, landing on Labuan in mid-1945, before being disbanded in 1946. History Initially designated the 71st Battalion, the unit was raised in the United Kingdom in June 1940, as part of the 25th Brigade, which was formed from Australian troops that had been sent to the country to help bolster the garrison after the Fall of France. Understrength upon formation, the battalion consisted of only three rifle companies at the outset, rather than the usual four, and drew personnel from infantry reinforcements and surplus support corps troops. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Alonzo Sparkes, individual and collective training was completed at Tidworth Barracks and Colchester, and by October 1940, the battalion was redesignated as the 2/32nd Battalion, to bring them into line with the other units of the Second Australian Imperial Force. At the time, along with the troops of the 18th Brigade, they were tasked with responding in the event of a cross-Channel invasion. The circumstances of the battalion's establishment overseas resulted in the unique situation of the battalion's personnel being issued two different unit colour patches. Personnel who were in the United Kingdom at the end of 1940 were issued with a circular UCP consisting of purple over red, with a border of grey. However, this UCP was issued without reference to Army Headquarters in Australia, who issued battalion reinforcements in Australia with a UCP consisting of an upright white and yellow rectangle inside a grey circle: this was intended to link the battalion to the 32nd Battalion, which had served during the First World War. Upon arrival at the unit, though, these patches were replaced with the purple and red patches. The battalion received a third UCP, following the unit's involvement in the fighting at Tobruk, when the 9th Division units adopted a 'T'-shaped UCP. The feared invasion of the United Kingdom never eventuated, and by early 1941, the two Australian infantry brigades that had been sent to the United Kingdom were transferred to the Middle East. Arriving there in March 1941, the 2/32nd Battalion, along with the rest of the 25th Brigade, joined the 9th Division. A fourth company was raised while the battalion completed further training in Palestine and then, in April, the battalion joined the fighting in the Western Desert. After the Allies were pushed back to Tobruk, the 2/32nd Battalion was moved forward by train to Mersa Matruh, and then by ship to the encircled port of Tobruk. By May, they were firmly established and around this time, the battalion was transferred to the 24th Brigade, joining its other two battalions in the defence of the port. They remained there, conducting patrols and manning the line, until 23 September 1941, when the majority of the Australian garrison was withdrawn by sea. The 2/32nd subsequently served in Palestine and Lebanon until July 1942 when the 9th Division was called upon to help stem the tide of the German and Italian advance around El Alamein; throughout the remainder of the year, the battalion took part in the First and Second Battles of El Alamein. In December 1942, the battalion was withdrawn back to Gaza, where the 9th Division concentrated prior to departure from the Middle East; the Japanese had entered the war in the Pacific the previous year, and the Australian government had requested that their troops be returned as they were needed for the fighting in New Guinea. After a parade at Gaza in December, the 9th Division departed the Middle East in January 1943, arriving back in Australia the following month. A period of reorganisation followed, during which time the battalion was converted to the jungle divisional establishment, before being committed to the fighting for the first time in the Pacific in September 1943, when they were assigned to capture Lae, during the final stages of the Salamaua-Lae campaign. After conducting an amphibious landing north-west of the town, the battalion's involvement in the fighting was limited as it was held back as part of the divisional reserve throughout the operation and Lae was captured sooner than expected. The battalion's next campaign followed only a few weeks later, when the operations to secure the Huon Peninsula were launched, with the 24th Brigade landing at Finchhafen in late September. Throughout the following months, the 2/32nd was involved in the fighting around the landing beaches and then the advance inland. It was heavily involved in the fighting around Pabu, where over 195 Japanese were killed before the Australians continued the advance into the Christmas Hills in December 1943. The battalion's campaign ended in February 1944, when it was withdrawn back to Australia for rest. 2/32nd Battalion stores being transported by jeep on Borneo, July 1945 A long period of training followed on the Atherton Tablelands, as inter-Allied politics resulted in limited opportunities for the employment of Australian troops throughout 1944 and into 1945. As a result, it was not until mid-1945 that the 2/32nd went into battle again. The Borneo campaign ultimately proved to be their final involvement in the war. During the initial operations to capture Labuan, the battalion remained in reserve, and only came ashore on 12 June. The battalion was transported from Labuan to Padas Bay four days, on 16 June, via landing craft, and following this took part in capturing Weston the next day. The 2/32nd subsequently patrolled towards Beaufort, carrying out an attack on the town in concert with the 2/43rd Battalion on 26 June, to secure the Weston‚ÄìBeaufort railway line. Throughout early July the battalion advanced towards Papar. The main advance was made along the railway line with a flanking move being provided by one company that conducted an amphibious landing to the south; after these moves, the town was subsequently taken on 12 July 1945. Following the end of hostilities in August, the 2/32nd's personnel were repatriated to Australia in drafts for demobilisation or transfer to other units for further service. The remaining personnel were transported back to Australian as a cadre in January 1946, at which time the 2/32nd was disbanded. During its service, a total of 2,916 men served with the battalion of whom 214 were killed, 567 wounded and 225 captured. Members of the 2/32nd received the following decorations: three Distinguished Service Orders, four Military Crosses, four Distinguished Conduct Medals, 16 Military Medals, and 42 Mentions in Despatches; in addition, three members of the battalion were appointed as three Officers of the Order of the British Empire.

Since the 1850s, it has served as the Manly embarkation and disembarkation point for the Manly to Sydney ferry service. The wharf has been redeveloped a number of times since the first structure was constructed in 1856. New facilities were added in the early 20th century, and it was rebuilt in a modernist style in the early 1940s, the basic form of which remains today. The wharf was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 April 2000. In addition to passenger services, a cargo service was also run to Manly until the 1928-opening of the Spit Bridge. Following the closure of the cargo service, an amusement park, Manly Fun Pier, was opened on the east wharf in 1931 which closed prior to the 1990 redevelopment of the wharf. Services To the south west of the main wharf is the Manly Hotel Wharf also known as the East Wharf, which from a transport perspective is regarded as part of Manly Wharf.Manly Wharf Public Transport Map Transport for NSW Services from that wharf are shown as operating from platform 3 in the services below.

History  Fairlight (left) and Brighton The first wharf was constructed in 1856 on the same site as the present wharf. Lumby (2016) says the date was 1855, and the wharf built by English-born merchant and Manly enthusiast, Henry Gilbert Smith, who envisaged the place as a seaside resort. Smith bought up land in 1853 and eventually acquired an interest in steam ferries serving the locality. As well as building a house known as \\"Fairlight\\", Smith was responsible for cottages, a hotel, church, school, pleasure grounds and swimming baths. He also had much to do with planting the first Norfolk Island pines (Araucaria heterophylla) on the ocean front. Prior to the construction of the first Spit Bridge in 1928, retired passenger ferries were used as cargo carriers. Following the closure of the cargo service, an amusement park, Manly Fun Pier, was opened on the east wharf. The amusement park closed in 1989 and the two wharf structures were redeveloped in 1990. Dee Why approaching Manly Wharf, early 1940s which is being rebuilt. Image shows the older Edwardian structure being replaced by the current modernist structure. On the left is the east wharf which was a cargo wharf until 1928 and then an amusement park until 1989 Improvements were made to the wharf in the first half of the 20th century. These were swept away at the end of the inter-war era after the Maritime Services Board decided to construct an \\"imposing\\" new wharf during 1938 following several years of local agitation. A fire at the wharf in 1939 precipitated further action. The Maritime Services Board engaged gifted young modernist architect Arthur Baldwinson (1908‚Äì68), not long after his return from several years working in England, to design major reconstructions of the ferry wharves at Manly and Circular Quay. The wharf was built in a modernistic transport idiom with typical stylistic features of era such as play of circular and rectangular geometric terms, bayed facade to the water (marine connotations), wide arc plan at entrance, clock tower with \\"fins,\\" flat roofing marked by wide fascia board. The current entrance was originally designed as a tram terminus and turning area. The structure was subjected to major alterations to the wharf wings involving a T-shaped clerestorey. The works were completed in 1941. Until the mid-1960s, ferries docked at both sides of the wharf. When the Port Jackson & Manly Steamship Company introduced hydrofoils to the Manly service in the mid-1960s, a pontoon was attached to the eastern side to allow the hydrofoils to berth without their foils fouling the wharf. This was removed when the hydrofoils were replaced by JetCats in 1991. When the Freshwater class ferries were introduced in the 1980s, the western berth was rebuilt to accommodate their onboard gangways. The wharf complex has a number of retail outlets and restaurants.About Manly Wharf In 2014, plans were lodged to add a second storey to the wharf.Restaurants, extra shops planned in $7 million revamp of Manly Wharf Manly Daily 25 September 2014Manly Wharf revamp looks towards fine dining Hospitality Magazine 26 September 2014 The wharf was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 April 2000.  Description  A broad wharf supported on timber piers and with a concrete platform. The superstructure is constructed of steel and timber. The facade and side walls form an important architectural design, similar to the Circular Quay ferry terminals. The original part of the wharf was built in a modernistic transport idiom, with typical stylistic features of era including play of circular and rectangular geometric terms, bayed facade to the water (marine connotations), wide arc plan at entrance, clock tower with \\"fins\\", flat roofing marked by wide fascia board.

Extensive refurbishment in 1990.  Heritage listing  As at 11 April 2001, the wharf was considered of environmental significance as a visually prominent man-made feature; and of historical significance for its associations with the maritime activities at Manly as a tourist destination and suburb of Sydney, dependent on the ferry link to the CBD. Together with Circular Quay, the wharf is the only substantial older style ferry wharf surviving in Port Jackson: association with Manly's history as a recreational centre. Manly Wharf was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 April 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Of historical significance for its associations with the maritime activities at Manly as a tourist destination and suburb of Sydney, dependent on the ferry link to the Sydney CBD. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Of environmental significance as a visually prominent manmade feature.

Up until 1995 when this was introduced, the only digital SLR on the market had a very bulky external digital storage system. There were other primitive digital cameras but they were much lower resolution. Minolta combined an existing SLR with a three way splitter and three separate CCD image sensors, giving 1.75M pixel resolution. The base of the DSLR was the Minolta Maxxum 500si Super (the Dynax 500si Super in Europe and as Alpha 303si Super in Asia). Agfa produced a version of the RD-175 retailed as the Agfa ActionCam. The RD-175 was also notable as the first consumer digital camera to be used professionally, being used to create the full-motion claymation adventure video game The Neverhood. Technology Since state of the art CCD resolution at the time was not sufficient for Minolta, the light entering the central 12 mm √ó 16 mm area of the RD-175's focal plane was compressed by 0.4x relay optics behind the focal plane, similar to the optical reduction system used in the Nikon E series. The light bundled on the smaller sensor area increased the effective sensitivity (ISO) by 2 stops. Then the light was split and sent to three separate 4.8 √ó 6.4 mm sized 768 √ó 494 pixel (3 x 0.38 megapixel) image sensors, two used for green and one for the red and blue color, reducing the sensitivity increase to about 2 stops. The only usable ISO was 800. The three images were combined digitally and interpolated to the final size of 1.75 mega-pixels (1528 √ó 1146 pixels). Images were stored on an internal PCMCIA hard drive. The camera used Minolta AF A-mount lenses with a crop factor of 2.

He was the first known ƒçelnik of the Serbian court, in the nearest circle of the King, mentioned serving the first time in 1284 and the second time in 1327. The ƒçelnik was entrusted with the security of Church property from the nobility, and appeared in the role of a judge or executor of the King's decisions, in disputes between the Church and the nobility. Life He was born in the mid-13th century. Gradislav is mentioned in 1284, as serving King Stefan Milutin as ƒçelnik. The latter account also mentions a gift worth 400 perpers to the King, and 26 perpers to Gradislav. Gradislav is the first known ƒçelnik (—á–µ–ª–Ω–∏–∫, roughly \\"head, chief\\") that served a Serbian ruler. He was in the nearest circle of the King, and served at the royal court. The title holder in its early form, was entrusted with the security of property belonging to the Church from the aristocrats, so the holder appeared in the role of a judge or executor of the ruler's decisions, in disputes between the church and the nobility. At that time it was of a higher rank than stavilac, but lower than kaznac and tepƒçija, with vojvoda being the supreme title. In an edict from 1305‚Äì06, Branko is mentioned as ƒçelnik under Stefan Milutin, and is still in this position in an edict dated 1319. ≈†arkiƒá 1996, p. 66 In 1320, Stefan Uro≈° III (Milutin's son) returned from a 6-year exile at the Byzantine court in Constantinople, and received the appanage of Budimlje, while his half-brother and crown heir Stefan Konstantin was titled \\"King of Zeta\\". King Milutin became ill and died on October 29, 1321, and Konstantin was crowned King. Stefan Uro≈° III invaded Zeta after Konstantin refused to submit the throne to him, and killed Konstantin during the ensuing war. Next, ƒêura≈° Ilijiƒá served Stefan Uro≈° III as ƒçelnik (mentioned in 1326). The next year, Gradislav is mentioned as serving as ƒçelnik under Stefan Uro≈° III. In 1327, the hegumen of the Hilandar Monastery, Gervasije, arrived at the court of King Stefan Uro≈° III, because of a quarrel regarding the boundaries between the metochion (church-dependent territory) of Hilandar and the county of the Hardomiliƒá brothers Dmitar and Borislav (tepƒçija Hardomil's sons); the latter had taken a tract of land (\\"hills and the ground\\") between the village of Kosoriƒá and the Kosoriƒá monastery, which both parts claimed as theirs. Gradislav was sent to arbitrate the case, and was joined by twelve local elders that would show the exact boundaries between the parts. The tract of land was in fact part of the Hilandar metochion of Kosoriƒá, and after the boundaries were marked in the favour of Hilandar, hegumen Gervasije, on his own will, decided to give the brothers a piece of land that belonged to the ƒåeskovo monastery. On September 6, 1327, King Uro≈° III issued an edict with a golden seal at Svrƒçin, written by logotet Rajko, regarding the matter. This was the last mention of Gradislav.

Using the techniques of medicinal chemistry, the potency, selectivity, and other properties of these screening hits are optimized to produce candidate drugs.  Historical background  Classical pharmacology traditionally has been the basis for the discovery of new drugs. Compounds are screened in cellular or animal models of disease to identify compounds that cause a desirable change in phenotype. Only after the compounds have been discovered, an effort is made to determine the biological target of the compounds. More recently it has become popular to develop a hypothesis that a certain biological target is disease modifying and screen for compounds that modulate the activity of this purified target. Afterwards, these compounds are tested in animals to see if they have the desired effect. This approach is known as \\"reverse pharmacology\\" or \\"target based drug discovery\\" (TDD). However recent statistically analysis reveals that a disproportionate number of first-in-class drugs with novel mechanisms of action come from phenotypic screening which has led to a resurgence of interest in this method.  Similarity with pharmacognosy  Pharmacognosy, the investigation of botanics used in indigenous medical traditions is essentially classical pharmacology. Pharmacognosy and classical pharmacology are both often contrasted with reverse pharmacology, that is, working from the target backward to identify new drugs starting with screening libraries of compounds for affinity for particular target. In pharmacognosy, folk medicines are first tested in clinical trials for efficacy. Only after efficacy has been established, is an effort made to determine the biologic target of the drug.  Application to Ayurvedic drugs  Classical pharmacology is one of the approaches used for clinical trials on Ayurvedic drugs. In this approach, a folk medicine (e.g., Ayurveda) which has already been in use for many years and has anecdotal evidence of efficacy for the treatment of a disease (and is also presumed to be safe) is then tested for efficacy in a clinical trial. This method has been described somewhat confusingly as 'reverse pharmacology‚Äô by Dr. Ashok Vaidya. It is asserted that Ayurveda knowledge allows drug researchers to start from time-tested and safe botanical material. The best example of bioprospecting using traditional knowledge is reserpine, the anti- hypertensive alkaloid from Rauvolfia serpentina, which became available as a result of work carried out by CIBA in India in close collaboration with Ayurveda experts. The normal drug discovery course of ‚Äòlaboratory to clinics‚Äô in this case actually becomes from ‚Äòclinics to laboratories‚Äô.

February 2006. Nonetheless, no population for the village was recorded in the 1931 British census of Palestine. =Modern era= After the Six-Day War in 1967, Salhab has been under Israeli occupation. The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) established a three-member local development committee to administer the village's affairs in 1999. The principal services provided by the committee are the distribution of water and humanitarian aid. Today, Salhab's residents are entirely dependent on agriculture as a source of income. The village lacks educational institutions, health centers, retail shops and food markets and residents have to travel to 'Aqqaba and Tubas for access to such services. Geography Salhab is situated in the southwestern Zababdeh Valley on a small tell (\\"hill\\") with an average altitude of 430 meters above sea level. The village's steep northern slopes are full of scattered ancient building material dating to the Roman era. In 1987 the built-up area of Salhab consists of 15 dunams and is concentrated in the western section of the tell which also contains a number of small quarries. There are 30 cisterns in the village, but the nearest source of water is the Wadi al-Far'a spring, 10 kilometers to the southwest.

Following the book's release, Boyd, who was already a noteworthy theologian before the book's publication, gained national attention after the New York Times published a front page cover article on the book and Boyd's rejection of the religious right. He also discussed the book on The Charlie Rose Show and in the CNN documentary God's Warriors. The book was also discussed widely in publications such as Christianity Today and The Christian Century.  Background and summary  Boyd wrote the book in the wake of pressure he felt as a senior pastor to endorse George W. Bush and other conservative candidates, as well as other conservative causes, from the pulpit. During the 2004 United States Presidential Election year, many Christian evangelicals publicly supported the reelection of George W. Bush, and ended up playing a major role in his re- election. As early as the 1990s, Boyd had become seriously concerned about the politicization of Christianity in North America. Boyd was especially disturbed by the way in which Evangelical Christians had come to align themselves with right-wing politics and the Republican Party. Instead of endorsing Bush for president, he delivered a sermon series entitled \\"The Cross and the Sword\\" calling on Christians to take a more humble approach toward politics, arguing instead that Christians should be careful not to align themselves with any particular political ideology, party, or candidate and should instead focus on following Jesus and embodying the values he taught. Boyd then authored Myth of a Christian Nation to further explicate his views on the subject. Boyd's book challenges the theology of the Christian right and the theory of American exceptionalism, as well the claim that America is a \\"Christian Nation\\". He instead argues that America is flawed and imperfect just like any other nation, and that the United States mirrors all other nations, or \\"kingdoms of the world\\" as the book calls them. He then contrasts the ethics and foundations of the \\"kingdoms of the world\\" with Jesus' teaching of the kingdom of God. Boyd argues that Christians owe their full allegiance to the Kingdom of God and must reject the coercive, violent, and unjust methods and means used by the kingdoms of the world. Christians, he believes, have no duty to \\"Take America Back for God\\" or to even be involved in the political sphere, and should not use politics as a means of transforming society. Boyd's next book, The Myth of the Christian Religion: Losing Your Life for the Beauty of a Revolution, expands on many of the themes and topics discussed in The Myth of a Christian Nation.  Popular culture  Josh Dies, vocalist of the band Showbread, is a fan of Boyd and referenced the book in a song with the same title.

Marshall (August 23, 1875December 14, 1945) was an American writer. His historical novel Cedric the Forester was one runner-up for the inaugural Newbery Medal in 1922. Life Bernard Gay Marshall was born to Francis F. and Helen F. Doten Marshall in North Easton, Massachusetts, where he later attended high school. Wanting to be a writer, he \\"thought he could play in orchestras and make a living until he had a foothold as an author\\". He subsequently worked as a musician, legal stenographer, an advertising and technical writer, and as a ship builder during World War I. In July 1903 Marshall married Ida M. Conklin. The couple had one daughter, Harriet C. Marshall wrote five historical fiction novels, romantic adventure stories set in great periods of the Anglo-Saxon struggle for freedom.\\" The books are set in time periods ranging from the England of King Arthur to Andrew Jackson's United States. He also wrote short stories and articles for magazines, including Sunset, Boys' Life, St. Nicholas, Munsey's Magazine, The American Magazine and The American Boy. In addition, he wrote for technical magazines and edited several trade journals. By 1921 Marshall had moved to Berkeley, California, where he was a member of the San Francisco chapter of the Writer's Dinner Club. Bernard Gay Marshall died Dec. 14, 1945. Critical reception As a writer of historical fiction, Marshall's books were compared to Walter Scott's in length and desrciptive details, though another added that to call Cedric the Forester a second Ivanhoe was \\"a mistake\\", adding \\"Bernard Marshall has done a good piece of work, but he is not Sir Walter\\". Marshall's novels were widely read, and reviewed for both children and adults. His first book, Cedric the Forester, received one of the inaugural Newbery Honor awards in 1922, for \\"the most distinguished contribution to American literature for children\\". The American Boy issued part of his first book under the title \\"Churl and Overlord\\". The Unitarian Register Cedric the Forester referred to it as well written and informative, and the scouting magazine Boys' Life frequently reviewed his novels for its young readers. Marshall's novels were also well received by adults. Walter of Tiverton received a star from The Bookman, which reviewed it as a book for adults, as did The Outlook, calling it a \\"spirited romance\\". The Saturday Review praised Redcoat and the Minuteman for the \\"clean, clear simplicity of his narrative\\", saying the plot was \\"skilfully handled\\". Books Marshall's five books were all historical novels published by D. Appleton & Company. The first four were illustrated by J. Scott Williams. *Cedric the Forester, illus. J.S. Williams, D. Appleton, 1921, 318 pages When Saxon yeoman Cedric of Pellham Woods saves the life of Norman nobleman Dickon Mountjoy, he is made a squire, and a friendship begins between the two. Eventually Cedric becomes the best crossbowman in England, and is knighted. He then becomes instrumental in the establishment of the Magna Carta. The frequency of deaths in Cedric the Forester sometimes drew criticism. In 1922 Marshall was one runner-up for the inaugural Newbery Medal from the professional librarians, recognizing the previous year's \\"most distinguished contribution to American literature for children\\". Members of the American Library Association were asked to nominate a book and Cedric the Forester was one of six that received at least two votes;Page 3 in this reprint five were subsequently designated runners-up. Runner-up works are now called Newbery Honor Books, so latterday editions are authorized to display a silver seal on the cover. *Walter of Tiverton, illus. J.S.

Williams, Appleton, 1923, 317 pages Myles Delaroche, a descendant of Cedric the Forester, is an English Puritan, though his friend Arthur Hinsdale is a Royalist. The two men find their friendship tested by the English Civil War. The story portrays both sides of the struggle with understanding and sympathy. At one point Delaroche \\"saw that no peace would be durable, on whatever victories founded, if those who triumphed sought to impose their sway upon the nation and to forbid all forms of worship save their own.\\" Eventually Delaroche leaves England for the United States, allowing the series to continue there. *Redcoat and Minuteman, illus. J.S. Williams, Appleton, 1924, 277 pages Set during the American Revolution, this book tells the story of another Delaroche, Richard, who leaves Harvard to join the intelligence branch of the Minutemen. Delaroche encounters George Washington and Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, is mistaken for a loyalist, and takes part in the Battle of Bunker Hill. *Old Hickory's Prisoner: A Tale of the Second War for Independence, Appleton, 1925, 254 pages The United States is now involved in the War of 1812 and Hubert Delaroche is too young to join the army, so he volunteers as a messenger.

He was Count of Coligny since 1680 (in succession of his mother) and Duke of W√ºrttemberg-Montb√©liard since 1699 (in succession of his father) until his death. The first half of his life he was in exile and in military service of the House of Austria and lived for a long time in Silesia; only in 1697 he and his family were able to return of Montb√©liard, and two years later he assumed the government as the last legitimate male member of his dynasty. He gained a doubtful fame mainly through his arbitrary and absolutist rule as well as by his extravagant family life, which is why he is considered the \\"Black Sheep\\" of the House of W√ºrttemberg. Origins His father was George II (5 October 1626 ‚Äì 1 June 1699), who in 1662 succeeded his older half- brother Leopold Frederick as Duke of W√ºrttemberg-Montb√©liard; however, in 1676 he was expelled from his domains by the troops of King Louis XIV of France and only was able to return in 1697, two years before his death. George II was a member of the Imperial Comital and (since 1496) Ducal House of W√ºrttemberg in the cadet branch founded in 1617 after the division of the family lands between John Frederick, Duke of W√ºrttemberg and his younger brothers, among them Louis Frederick (father of George II), who received the possessions on the left bank of the Rhine (Montb√©liard, Riquewihr and Horburg) with full sovereignty. His mother was Anne de Coligny (4 September 1624 ‚Äì 13 January 1680), who jointly with her older sister Henriette de Coligny became in the heiresses of the County of Coligny (now a commune in the Ain department in eastern France) following the recreation of the County by a decree of the King of France after the death of the last male heir of the House of Coligny, Henry-Gaspard de Coligny (Anne and Henriette's nephew and 3rd Duke of Coligny) in 1657. Anne de Coligny was a member of one of the oldest princely houses in Europe, as the County of Coligny was ruled since medieval times by the House of Coligny, the so-called \\"Principality of Coligny\\", which belonged firstly to the Kingdom of Burgundy and later belonged to the Duchy of Savoy, with Revermont and parts of Bresse belonged to the Holy Roman Empire. Life =Youth in exile= The eighth and youngest child of Duke George II of W√ºrttemberg-Montb√©liard by his wife, Comtesse Anne de Coligny, Leopold Eberhard was born in 21 May 1670 in the city of Montb√©liard. He was the third son of his parents but the only one who survived infancy: his older brothers, Otto Frederick and Conrad Louis, died in infancy in 1653 and 1659 respectively, long before his birth. His youth was traumatized by the fact that his family was expelled from their ancestral domains when Leopold Eberhard was just a 6-years-old boy, and only returned to Montb√©liard after 22 years of exile at the age of 28. This was because since the end of the 17th century W√ºrttemberg was involved in the war between the Holy Roman Empire and the Kingdom of France, the Nine Years' War, the Great Turkish War and the War of the Spanish Succession, who caused major devastating in the west parts of the country. W√ºrttemberg particularly suffered the attacks of foreign troops, like King Louis XIV who successfully conquered the left-bank possessions of W√ºrttemberg under his control, with Montb√©liard occupied by French troops during 1676-1679 and 1680-1697. In 1676, Leopold Eberhard had to flee with his father Duke George II from their domains. In 1680, the 10-year-old Leopold Eberhard became Comte de Coligny after the death of his mother, the sole surviving heiress of Comte Gaspard III de Coligny. A few years later, in 1684, was offered to the exiled family the opportunity to return, but only if Duke George II recognized the French authority over his domains and thus leaving the Federation of the Holy Roman Empire; he immediately rejected the offer. Until 1698, Montb√©liard was ruled by Frederick Charles, Duke of W√ºrttemberg- Winnental (George II's first-cousin) as regent, but also served as a guardian for his underage nephew Eberhard Louis, Duke of W√ºrttemberg; however, due to the outbreak of the Nine Years' War, Frederick Charles and his ward were forced to flee to Nuremberg and were temporarily captured in 1692 by French troops. Only after the end of the Nine Years' War by the Treaty of Ryswick Duke George II (and thus his heir Leopold Eberhard) could returned to Montb√©liard. =Military service= As a landless prince with little prospect of ever being able to rule Montb√©liard, Leopold Eberhard followed a military career in Austria and, after having proved his worth, was made colonel by Emperor Leopold I and took part in various battles against the Ottomans in Hungary, distinguished himself as the commander of Tokaj Fortress and successfully he drove them of the country. He then lived several years in exile with his W√ºrttemberg cousins who ruled the Duchy of Oels since 1649. The ducal court was established in the city of Oels (now Ole≈õnica, located in the Lower Silesian Voivodeship in southwestern Poland). Leopold Eberhard therefore lived for several years in Silesia. There he met Anna Sabine Hedwiger, a lady- in-waiting at the court of Oels, and fell in love with her; they married on 1 June 1695 at the town of Rejowiz near Pozna≈Ñ in order to legitimized their newborn child. Because according to the laws of the House of W√ºrttemberg this union was morganatic, the ceremony was secret and completely ignored by Duke George II, who was already prepared a marriage for him with a princess of royal blood. =Duke of W√ºrttemberg-Montb√©liard= After the conclusion of the Treaty of Ryswick in 1697, George II could return to Montb√©liard; however, the country had suffered territorial losses due to the peace conditions. When his father died in 1699, Leopold Eberhard succeeded him as Duke of W√ºrttemberg- M√∂mpelgard, as his older brothers had died prematurely. Its dominions extended primarily to the historic County of Montb√©liard, which at the beginning of the 15th century passed to the House of W√ºrttemberg through the marriage of Henriette, the last Countess from the House of Montfaucon with Eberhard IV, Count of W√ºrttemberg. The capital of County, now called Montb√©liard, is located in the Doubs department in the Bourgogne-Franche-Comt√© region in France. In addition to Montb√©liard, Leopold Eberhard inherited the County of Horburg (now Horbourg-Wihr, an Alsatian commune in the Haut-Rhin department in Grand Est in north-eastern France) and a number of cities, such as Blamont, Ch√¢telot, Cl√©rmont, H√©ricourt, Franquemont and Reichenweier (now Riquewihr), also a commune in the Haut-Rhin department. The style of government developed by Leopold Eberhard after his succession to the throne didn't add much to his popularity. The County of Montb√©liard, marked by decades of war, by marauding troops and by foreign occupation, would have needed a paterfamilias open to the needs of the population, but received an absolutist ruler who, perhaps through decades of exile, preferred his interests to the detriment of his subjects. This autocratic style of government led in 1704 to considerable unrest and riots of the population of Montb√©liard against their sovereign. Leopold Eberhard, who saw himself questioned his sovereign rights, ordered the lifting of urban privileges and immunities as a punishment. However, the city administration didn't want to accept this, so it turned to their liege lord, the Holy Roman Emperor, to protest and to remedy the situation. In his arrogance, Leopold Eberhard considered this act as an attack on his person and an open revolution and decided to restore order through military force. Since he couldn't count with the support of either his German cousins or neighbors, he turned to King Louis XIV and asked him for the deployment of French troops to quell the uprising. If the use of military force against the population alone was sufficient reason to lose all sympathies of his subjects, then the use of French troops contributed to the hatred of the country, since the hard time of the French occupation was still clearly remembered. For years, the Holy Roman Empire had been overshadowed by war and was blamed, not without reason, for the devastation of its own land. Similarly, his economic policy was arbitrary, as he sought to improve his financial position at the expense of his subjects. In order to obtain more funds, he began to make illegal expropriations, using the \\"right of confiscation\\" who entered in practice after the Thirty Years War: because of the widespread devastation and the high mortality among the rural population several properties became vacant and as sovereign lord over these domains, in 1713 he sent to each locality officers in his name to confiscate property whose owners were unable to show titles of property. For many farmers, however, this was impossible, as not only people and animals were killed by the past wars, but also burned all the documents with the houses; because many could not prove their property they lost their possessions to the sovereigns, which caused great indignation throughout the country and odious expropriations, but the people was too fearful and ignorant about law that they weren't unable to oppose with the necessary energy. As one of the few positive aspects of his administration, it should be mentioned that Leopold Eberhard used parts of the confiscated lands (especially in the land of Etobon near H√©ricourt) to settle peasants from other parts of the country in war-torn and ruined lands, thereby revitalizing the economy. Among them were numerous Mennonites who had been expelled from Switzerland and Alsace for religious reasons, which contributed significantly to the improvement of agriculture in the County of Montb√©liard, as they were diligent and open to innovation, including land cultivation (especially potatoes) and livestock in Montb√©liard, and improving in the breed of cattle (see Montb√©liarde cattle). =Private life= A special part of Leopold Eberhard's biography was his scandalous family life. Married since 1 June 1695 with the Silesian lady-in- waiting Anne Sabine Hedwiger, this union according to the family laws of the House of W√ºrttemberg was morganatic; for this, Leopold Eberhard urged the Emperor to give his wife a noble title. In order to obtain this, he showed proofs that the Hedwiger family had noble origins and served the Empire with loyalty and dedication during generations; even a genealogy was constructed to support the claim. However, the case remained in suspense for the next six years. In the meanwhile, Leopold Eberhard and Anne Sabine had four children, of whom only two survive infancy: * Leopold Eberhard (b. 30 March 1695 ‚Äì d. 7 March 1709), born before their parents' marriage, was legitimized; Count of Sponeck since 1701. * Leopoldine Eberhardine (baptized 15 February 1697 ‚Äì d. 1786), Countess of Sponeck since 1701; married on 31 August 1719 with her adopted (and reputed biological) half-brother Karl Leopold von Sandersleben. * George Leopold (baptized 12 December 1697 ‚Äì d. ca. 1750); Count of Sponeck since 1701; married on 22 February 1719 with his adopted (and reputed biological) half-sister Eleonore Charlotte von Sandersleben. * Charlotte Leopoldine (b. 1700 ‚Äì d. 3 February 1703), Countess of Sponeck since 1701. However, soon the marriage failed, mostly because of Leopold Eberhard's unfaithfulness. During his campaigns against the Turks, the prince developed a friendship with Richard Curie, also known as \\"l'Esp√©rance\\" (the Hope, a war nickname), Captain of the Imperial army and son of a sergeant of justice in Montb√©liard.Louis Gabriel Michaud, Joseph Fr. Michaud: Biographie universelle, ancienne et moderne, Vol. 29 [retrieved 23 December 2017] Richard had five children, one son and four daughters; the Curie sisters (S√©bastienne, Polix√®ne, Henriette Edwige and √âlisabeth Charlotte Pierre-Fr√©d√©ric Beurlin: Recherches historiques sur l‚Äôancienne seigneurie d‚ÄôH√©ricourt, p. 147. [retrieved 23 December 2017]) were able to seduce Leopold Eberhard, and at one point all became his mistresses; however, at the end only Henriette Edwige and √âlisabeth Charlotte were able to kept the interest of the prince. After their return to Montb√©liard in 1697, Leopold Eberhard persuaded his wife to take the two Curie sisters as ladies-in-waiting. Without any care of the mockery of his subjects, Leopold Eberhard lived with his wife and mistresses until 1700, when Anne Sabine, found this situation unbearable, and finally separated from her husband (but without divorcing him) and moved to the castle of H√©ricourt, where she remained for the rest of her days. Finally, on 1 August 1701 Anne Sabine Hedwiger was created Countess of Sponeck (with the title of \\"Hoch- und Wohlgeboren\\") by the Emperor with the same title awarded to her children. The castle chosen by the title was a small Burg situated in the banks of the Rhine, and belonged to the House of W√ºrttemberg for generations. Despite the estrangement between him and Anne Sabine, Leopold Eberhard obtained for his brothers-in-law Georg Wilhelm Hedwiger (who continue to serve as the Duke's governor in the castle of Montb√©liard) and Johann Rudolf Hedwiger the title of Count of Sponeck for each of them. At first, was Henriette Edwige Curie who obtain the supremacy over the Leopold Eberhard's heart, and she became in his official mistress. However, the Duke marry her in 1697 with Johann Ludwig von Sandersleben, who appeared as the legal father of Henriette Edwige's first three children: * Karl Leopold von Sandersleben (b. 1698 ‚Äì d. after 19 October 1759), Baron de l'Esperance since 1700, Count of Coligny since 1716; married on 31 August 1719 with his (reputed biological) half-sister Countess Leopoldine Eberhardine of Sponeck. * Ferdinand Eberhard von Sandersleben (b. 31 August 1699 ‚Äì d. after 19 October 1759), Baron de l'Esperance since 1700, Count of Coligny since 1716; married on 16 July 1737 with Baroness Franziska Benigna Waldner von Freundstein (b. 8 February 1716 ‚Äì d. 21 February 1750). * Eleonore Charlotte von Sandersleben (b. 14 October 1700 ‚Äì d. 11 November 1773), Baroness de l'Esperance since 1700, Countess of Coligny since 1716; married on 22 February 1719 with her (reputed biological) half-brother Count George Leopold of Sponeck. In order to improve the status of his mistress, on 11 September 1700 Leopold Eberhard managed to obtain from the Emperor the title of Baroness de l'Esperance for Henriette Edwige and her children; in addition, the title was extended to Henriette's surviving siblings (including √âlisabeth Charlotte, who also was another mistress of the Duke) and their issue. After a short-lived union, on 1 March 1701 Henriette Edwige obtained the divorce from her husband, and from this point she and her children began to live at the Montb√©liard court.Neues allgemeines deutsches Adels-Lexicon Vol. 8, pp. 36-40. [retrieved 23 December 2017]. The real paternity of the Sandersleben children was questioned, but in all probability all were fathered by Leopold Eberhard. Henriette Edwige and Leopold Eberhard had five children, of whom only two survived infancy: * Baroness Elisabeth de l'Esperance (b. 1 May 1702 ‚Äì d. 12 March 1703). * Baroness Eberhardine de l'Esperance (b. 18 May 1703 ‚Äì d. after 1756). * Baron Leopold Eberhard de l'Esperance (b. 13 August 1704 ‚Äì d. 15 May 1705). * Baroness Leopoldine Eberhardine de l'Esperance (b. 15 September 1705 ‚Äì d. after 1756). * Baroness Henriette Hedwig de l'Esperance (b. 27 May 1707 ‚Äì d. May 1709). Henriette Edwige Curie died on 7 November 1707, six months after her last childbirth.Unequal and Morganatic Marriages in German Law [retrieved 23 December 2017]. In 1714, Leopold Eberhard legally adopted the three Sandersleben children. On 6 October of that year, the marriage between Leopold Eberhard and Anne Sabine Hedwiger was finally dissolved by the consistorium of Montb√©liard under the grounds of \\"incompatibilit√© d'humeur\\" (incompatibility of characters), under the condition that neither of them remarry; however, Anne Sabine contracted a second marriage in 1719 with Roger de Langheac (d. 1746), 6th Marquis de Coligny 2nd Comte de Dalet and descendant of Charles de Coligny. She died on 9 November 1735. On 10 August 1716, Leopold Eberhard gave to his Sandersleben adoptive children the County of Coligny, jointly with his own biological legally surviving offspring; from them they were called Count/Countess of Sandersleben-Coligny. The official French recognition of this cession was confirmed on 5 February 1718 in Paris;Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels: Adelslexikon vol. XII, tome 125, pp. 236‚Äì237. [retrieved 24 December 2017]. six months later (15 August), the Duke contracted a second married with √âlisabeth Charlotte Curie, sister of Henriette and also another of his mistresses. They had six children (some of them born before the wedding and subsequently legitimized), of whom only two survived to adulthood: * Baroness Henriette Hedwig de l'Esperance (b. 22 April 1711 ‚Äì d. 1728), born before their parents' marriage, was legitimized. * Baron Leopold Eberhard de l'Esperance (b. 28 July 1712 ‚Äì d. Ostheim, 13 September 1730), born before their parents' marriage, was legitimized. * Baron George de l'Esperance (b. 8 November 1714 ‚Äì d. 12 January 1715), born and died before their parents' marriage. * Baron Karl Leopold de l'Esperance (b. 1716 ‚Äì d. 25 July 1793), born before their parents' marriage, was legitimized; Imperial Count of Horneburg since 1761. Married three times: firstly on 16 May 1741 with Maria Jose de Fuentes de Toledo de Castilla (b. 1718/19 ‚Äì d. 30 June 1752), secondly with Baroness Elisabeth Charlotte von Malsen-Tilborch, and thirdly on 15 July 1783 with Marie Judith de la Riviere (b. 4 January 1748 ‚Äì d. Orl√©ans, 28 May 1834). * Baroness Elisabeth Charlotte de l'Esperance (b. 31 December 1717 ‚Äì d. 1729), born before their parents' marriage, was legitimized * Baron George Frederick de l'Esperance (b. Montb√©liard, 16 August 1722 ‚Äì d. Graz, 20 January 1760), married Countess Therese von Hartig (b. 1 September 1728 ‚Äì 23 March 1797). =Succession and death= A major scandal erupted when in 1719, Leopold Eberhard arranged the marriage of his two surviving children from his first marriage with his Sandersleben adopted children, who are in all probability his own biological offspring; in addition, the Duke began to sought to have all of his children declared legitimate and apt to succeed him, despite the previously signed Wilbader Treaty (18 May 1715) with his kinsman Eberhard Louis, Duke of W√ºrttemberg, were he recognized that he never married according to the family laws and that none of his children had any succession rights. In 1721, Leopold Eberhard asked the Emperor the recognition of his second marriage and the title of Hereditary Prince of Montb√©liard for his oldest surviving son Count George Leopold of Sponeck, but his efforts were unsuccessful. Leopold Eberhard died on 25 March 1723 aged 53 and was buried on 27 March at night without much ceremony in the crypt of the Church of Saint- Maimb≈ìuf of Montb√©liard. The Duke's children Count Georg Leopold of Sponeck as well as the Barons de l'Esp√©rance sued, but their claims were rejected by the Reichshofrat on 8 April 1723, which said that \\"according to the known laws and customs of Germany and the family compact of 1617, the children were unable to inherit to the princely dignity and to succeed to the immediate imperial estates and fiefs\\". The children then took the dispute to French courts, which sequestered the estates in M√∂mpelgard (Montb√©liard). Finally the French courts rejected their claims in 1747 and in 1748 the duke of W√ºrtemberg came into possession of M√∂mpelgard. The dispute dragged on for years and the duke's descendants did not give in until 1761.Johann Jakob Moser: Johann Jakob Mosers moempelgardisches Staatsrecht, ed. by Wolfgang Hans Stein, Stuttgart 1983, pp. 68‚Äì94.

The AnimeNation online store closed in 2014. AN Entertainment In 2002, AnimeNation entered the anime market due to increased licensing and retail competition. The name AN Entertainment comes from AnimeNation (AN), and Entertainment was chosen to possibly allow other shows (including live action) to be licensed.

The first title the company licensed was Risky Safety with Bang Zoom! Entertainment producing the dub and ADV Films distributing the release. AN Entertainment used a script created by Fansub group Sachigumi with modifications for its Risky Safety release and also acquired the TV broadcast rights. AN Entertainment acquired Miami Guns, but not TV broadcast rights, and the dub was produced by Phoenix Post Sound (Coastal Studios).

The Group is a major producer of Fragrance & Flavour chemicals, catering to key F&F; multinationals in markets such as North and South America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. Additionally, the Anthea Group produces speciality chemicals which are used in a range of applications such as pharmaceuticals, flame retardant polymers and agrochemicals. History The Anthea Group has its origins in 1991 with the establishment of Anthea Aromatics Pvt. Ltd. (AAPL), a company that was set up in Navi Mumbai to manufacture speciality chemicals used in the perfumery and flavour industry. In 2002, a new manufacturing facility was set up in Roha, Maharashtra to manufacture a key perfumery intermediate. In 2007, AAPL entered into a 50:50 joint venture with les D√©riv√©s R√©siniques et Terp√©niques (DRT), a reputed French multinational engaged in the research, development and manufacture of resin and terpene derivatives. In 2008, The Anthea Group took over Crown Chemicals Pvt. Ltd. located at Tarapur MIDC, and revamped this facility to manufacture synthetic Piperonal (Heliotropin) through a novel and eco-friendly route. In 2011, DRT took a substantial stake in Crown Chemicals. Subsequently, DRT increased its stake in Crown Chemicals, which is now a 50:50 JV between DRT and The Anthea Group. In 2016, ICICI Ventures, the private equity arm of ICICI Bank, is investing about Rs 120 crore for a minority stake in the Anthea Group. The Anthea Group is one of the most profitable in India with revenues of over Rs 350 crore (US$53 million) in 2015 - 16. The Anthea Group consists of four companies. Anthea Aromatics was founded by Vincent Paul, who is a former head of organic chemistry at Hindustan Lever Ltd.

The Anthea Group claims special focus on green chemistry and eco- friendly processes. The R&D; lab has been certified by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (India) since 2004. = Development of Synthetic Heliotropin (Piperonal) = Heliotropin (also known as Piperonal), an extract of the Sassafras tree, is used in the manufacture of perfumes, soaps and body lotions. Natural Heliotropin is obtained from Sassafras oil which is extracted from the roots of the Sassafras tree, a species of deciduous trees in the family Lauraceae. The massive commercial felling of Sassafras forests has led to the danger of extinction of the species. It is estimated that around 5 million trees are cut down every year to meet the worldwide demand for Heliotropin. The Anthea Group through its in-house research developed a synthetic grade of Heliotropin having a high purity, and has set up manufacturing facilities in Group company, Crown Chemicals. Synthetic Piperonal manufactured in Crown Chemicals is widely used in Fragrance, Flavour and Pharmaceutical applications. The US Food and Drug Administration has found synthetic Piperonal to be safe for human consumption.

Aberrant decoding or aberrant reading is a concept used in fields such as communication and media studies, semiotics, and journalism about how messages can be interpreted differently from what was intended by their sender. The concept was proposed by Umberto Eco in an article published first in 1965 in Italian and in 1972 in English. Concept Every communication act requires that the messages must be encoded into a set of signs by the sender. These signs must then be transmitted and decoded by the receiver to understand the contained messages. The code system must be shared by both the sender and the receiver in order for the communication to succeed. For example, thoughts must be encoded into words, transmitted through air, and then be decoded back to thoughts. Often the sender has a certain meaning to convey with his message, hoping the receiver will interpret it correctly. This right interpretation can be called the preferred decoding or preferred reading. When the interpretation of the message is different from what was intended, this can be called aberrant decoding. Aberrant decodings can occur in a more widespread range of situations, as wrong interpretation of a media product or text whose incoming message is not the one intended by the creator of the product or text.Danesi, Marcel (2009), Dictionary of Media and Communications. M.E.Sharpe, Armonk, New York. p. 3 According to Eco, aberrant decodings were rare in pre-industrial societies, when most communication occurred between people who shared the same culture. He lists four classes of exceptions where aberrant decodings could have happened: *People who did not share the same language. *People trying to interpret the meanings of past cultures. For example, Medieval people looking at Roman art. *People who did not share the same belief system. For example, Christians looking at pagan art. *People who came from different cultures. For example, white Europeans looking at Aboriginal art. Eco continues that in contemporary media, instead of being exceptions, aberrant decodings have become the norm. For example, TV broadcasters know beforehand that their messages will be interpreted in various ways. He speculated that because of this freedom of interpretation, the power of media over individuals might be much less influential than is thought. This idea of examining the messages contained in the media and how the audience interprets them has since become one of the core concepts of academic media research. Eco's article influenced, among others, Stuart Hall's encoding/decoding theory. John Fiske has argued that aberrant decoding occurs mainly with iconic codes, referring to visual messages.Iconic codes or iconic signs in semiotics and communication theory could also refer to a class of signs defined by iconicity (as in Peirce's triadic sign theory). But in this case Fiske contrasts iconic signs with \\"verbal language\\" (p. 78). As an example, he explains how prehistoric cave paintings of animals are often seen as graceful and moving. However, in 1960 Margaret Abercrombie claimed that the paintings are, in fact, depictions of dead animals. Thus if we accept Abercrombie's claim, we can argue that our modern culture, where we value living animals and only rarely encounter dead ones, has led us to aberrant decoding of the paintings.

It was designed by Sheerin & Hennessy (1885) and Clive Lucas & Partners (1985 restoration), and built during 1885. The property is owned by Mosman Council. The property is also called Boronia. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Boronia is one of two almost identical neighbouring freestanding houses built in 1885 by two Newtown carriage builders, James and John Kearey, as residences for themselves with a common garden and entrance. The other residence was Telopea, at 89B Cowles Road, which is now altered and built out by later development including a service station. Both houses are attributed to the well-known and prolific Sydney architectural firm of Sheerin & Hennessy. The 1890s depression hit the Kearey business so badly that all their assets had to be sold including \\"Boronia\\". The house faces south, addressing Military Road, from which it is set well back in an open garden behind a stone fence capped with iron cresting. A substantial two-storey wing was added at the north-east corner, probably in the late 1890s and soon afterwards a glazed bay with Art Nouveau detailing was added to the drawing room in this wing. The building remained virtually unaltered until it was acquired by Mosman Council in 1952, at which time it was considerably modified for occupation by the Mosman Municipal Library. Between 1978 and 1985 the building was used as offices and further altered. During 1985 Boronia was restored, reconstructed and adapted for use as a restaurant and function centre. =James and Ellen Kearey= Advertisement for the sale of Boronia and Telopea in 1896. The brothers James and John Kearey built Boronia in 1885. It was part of an estate which contained two identical houses called Boronia and Telopea and a common garden. James occupied Boronia and John lived in Telopea. James Kearey was born in 1842 in Sydney.New South Wales Birth Certificate V1842427 134 His parents were John and Mary Ann Kearey who had immigrated from Ireland. In about 1840 his father had established a coachbuilding business in Sydney and the firm had become very successful. His mother Mary Ann died in 1849 when he was only seven years old.New South Wales Death Certificate V18491142 140 His father remarried Catherine Fraser in 1851New South Wales Births Deaths and Marriages and James and his elder brother John were brought up by their stepmother. In 1872 his father died and John seems to have taken over the management of the coachbuilding firm. However, in 1877 the brothers together constructed a very impressive building in Pitt Street which featured in an 1878 edition of the Australian Town and Country Journal. The new business was called Kearey Brothers and for the next two decades the firm flourished. The brothers were credited with inventing a new type of carriage which was described in the newspaper The Sydney Mail. In 1871 James married Honora Murphy and the couple had three children. Honora died in 1879 and soon after James married Ellen Doherty. James and Ellen had eight children, five of whom were born at Mosman. In 1885 John and James built two adjoining villa houses in Mosman which they called Boronia and Telopea. James and his wife Ellen lived in Boronia and John and his wife Lucy lived in Telopea. The house has been described as it was when the Kearey brothers lived there in the following terms. :\\"Originally there was a row of large camphor laurels just inside the front fence and round flowerbeds were cut into the lawn to contain various species of plants. :The gardens originally included a vegetable and flower garden, an orchid and shrubberies and fern house. Several gardeners were employed to keep the grounds in order and to tend the grass tennis court\\". In 1891 John's wife Lucy died and three years later in 1894 John also died. James and Ellen continued to live at Boronia for two more years. However, in 1896 both houses were put on the market. The advertisement for their sale is shown on the right. Boronia was bought by George Willis Godwin and the Godwin family lived there for the next 50 years. =The Godwin Family= George Willis Godwin was born in 1856 in England and migrated to Australia at the age of 23 in 1879. In 1896 when he was 40 years old he married Olive Mildred Simpson who was 18 years his junior. He bought Boronia in the same year he was married and he and Olive lived there for the rest of their lives. The couple had three children John Willis Godwin, Ena Godwin and Noell Godwin. George was a money broker and had a flourishing business in Castlereagh Street in Sydney. After he retired he remained at BoroniaNSW Electoral Rolls between 1930 and 1940. and died in 1940 at the age of 84. He left his estate to his son John but his wife Olive continued to live at Boronia until her death in 1951. One of the Godwin's granddaughters, daughter of John Willis Godwin, Patricia Judy Godwin, gave an account of her memories of Boronia when she went to visit Olive with her mother. She said: After Olive died in 1951 her son John sold Boronia in the following year to Mosman Council. The Council still has ownership of the house. Since 1952 they have used the premises as a library, an office and a restaurant. Recently a major refurbishment of the house has been made by the Council and it is now managed under a commercial ten-year leasing arrangement with Mosman Catering who operate as a high tea restaurant and also host weddings and other events.  Description  =Property/Garden= The house is set in a formal Victorian garden setting, with a circular carriage drive or loop immediately south of the main front door, large lawn areas and trees and shrubs set off to both sides and the rear. Large old tree specimens of evergreen magnolia (M.grandiflora), camphor laurel (Cinnamomum camphora) flank it to the south- east, and a pair of symmetrically placed lemon scented gums (Corymbia maculata) frame the house's front gates to Military Road.Read, S., pers.comm., September 2006. =House= The house is completed in the Victorian Filigree style. Boronia is a two storeyed brick house with walls stuccoed and lined externally to simulate ashlar. Its main roof is hipped and slated and the verandah roof is corrugated metal painted in wide stripes. The double storey verandah is an ensemble of cast iron columns, friezes, brackets and balustrades, emphasised at the centre by a gable. The iron balustrading pattern was registered as NSW design No. 90 in 1881 by Fletcher, Bennett and Frew, Sydney Ironfounders. The front boundary is marked by an unusual assemblage of stone fence, cast iron fencing and impressive gates. Some original elements survive internally. = Condition = As at 6 September 2006, the building and its setting are in excellent condition. = Modifications and dates = *1920s: front stone wall moved back (north) due to road widening works. *Sympathetic minor alterations.  Heritage listing  As at 8 September 2006, Boronia was an excellent example of a substantial villa in the Victorian Filigree style on a site of ample frontage retaining much of its 19th century formal Victorian garden setting to the road. The handsome symmetry of the house is complemented by the open gardens and the stone and iron palisade front fence. The building and its setting are in excellent condition. Boronia was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. This item is historically rare regionally. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. This item is socially representative locally.

The dressing room balconies, with their short stretches of white fencing, can be seen on the middle floor at either end of the structure The Lord's Pavilion is a cricket pavilion at Lord's Cricket Ground in London, England. Designed by Thomas Verity and built in 1889‚Äì1890, the pavilion has achieved Grade II* listed heritage designation. Like the rest of Lord's, the pavilion is owned by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) but is also used by Middlesex County Cricket Club and the England national cricket team.  History  The current pavilion was opened in 1890 at a cost of ¬£21,000 after the original pavilion was destroyed by fire. Until 1999 women - except Queen Elizabeth II - were not permitted to enter the pavilion as members during play, due to the gender-based membership policy of MCC. The 1998 decision to allow female MCC members represented a historic modernisation of the pavilion and its clubs. In 1986 Diana Edulji was refused entry to the pavilion while captaining India on their tour of England. She quipped that the MCC should change its name to MCP (\\"male chauvinist pigs\\"). In 2004, the pavilion was closed for a major refurbishment costing ¬£8.2 million. The pavilion seating was extended to the upper levels and certain historic areas, such as the Long Room, were refurbished and redecorated. The only batsman to hit a ball over the top of the pavilion has been Albert Trott in 1889. In 2010, Somerset County Cricket Club captain, Marcus Trescothick was reportedly offered ¬£1 million to hit a six over the pavilion.  Rules  When Lord's is hosting a Test match, only members of MCC are permitted in the pavilion. However, for all other matches, members of Middlesex and their opponents are also permitted in the pavilion with the option to bring in two guests. This policy has been criticised by some MCC members who complained that the dress code was being flouted on Twenty20 matchdays by members' guests. The dress code in the pavilion is notoriously strict. Men are required to wear \\"ties and tailored coats and acceptable trousers with appropriate shoes\\" and women are required to wear \\"dresses; or skirts or trousers worn with blouses, and appropriate shoes\\". Features =Dressing rooms= The pavilion houses dressing rooms designated for home and away teams. Each dressing room has its own balcony, from which players waiting to bat, or other team personnel can watch the progress of the game. =Honours boards= If a player manages to score a century or take five wickets in a Test match innings, their names are placed on the Lord's honours board, located in the dressing rooms. England players' achievements are recorded on boards in the home dressing room and all other nationalities in the away dressing room. Several notable players, such as Shane Warne, Sachin Tendulkar, Brian Lara, Ricky Ponting, Curtly Ambrose have failed to qualify to have their names placed on the honours board. =Long Room= The Long Room, described as \\"The most evocative four walls in world cricket\\",Arm-Ball to Zooter, Lawrence Booth, Penguin 2006, , pp.150‚Äì151 is a feature of the Pavilion, a room players walk through on their way from the dressing rooms to the middle. The walk from dressing room to cricket field at Lord's is notoriously long and complex. On his Test debut in 1975, David Steele got lost \\"and ended up in the pavilion's basement toilets\\". The Long Room is lined with paintings of famous cricketers and administrators, from the 18th century to the 21st. Members of MCC and their guests have free access to the room (there are windows with views of the ground) and will often greet Australian batsmen walking out to bat with \\"witticisms ... like 'See you soon'\\".The joke being that the batsman will soon be out and return the way he went On this point, Australian Justin Langer,Langer also played at Lord's on many occasions as a (home) Middlesex player described walking through the Long Room like \\"being bearhugged by an invisible spirit\\". =Sightscreens= The Lord's pavilion includes four movable sightscreens, which move on wheels, to allow batsmen to adjust for different angles of bowling.

Education  Matejka was born in Jind≈ôich≈Øv Hradec; she studied at the Secondary School of Glassmaking in Kamenick√Ω ≈†enov from 1981 until 1985. She was a student of Professor Vladimir Kopecky at the Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague (AAAD) between 1989 and 1997. In 1995 she studied for two months at the Glasgow School of Art, in the Ceramic Department. From 2000 to 2005 she studied for a PhD, again at the AAAD.Sylva Petrova, Research Professor and Director of Institute for International Research in Glass asks Alena 10 questions.  Work  Matejka creates small and large sculptures from stone, marble, glass and ice. She creates small sculptures which float on water, but also builds huge installations such as the one in the underground Baroque casemates in Vy≈°ehrad. Gorlice is a major installation in the underground hall in the old castle of Vy≈°ehrad, consisting of a central colonnade of stone, with multiple stops, each with a different sculpture symbolising the choices one faces in life. While in Scotland in 1995, she developed an interest in studying ancient tombs and their ornamentation, and also visited old settlements. Later, she made a series of kettles from glass. This has fragments from her journey in Scotland, inspired by the landscape, the people, and the old Scottish culture. The kettles were given chassis, wheels and fictional royal names. In 2007, she created a bath tub made out of a single block of red granite from Sweden, entitled I sink, therefore I am, a pun on Ren√© Descartes' statement, I think, therefore I am. On the outside of the tub is a longer quote by Descartes.I sink ‚Äì Therefore I am ‚Äì www.alenamatejka.com (accessed 15 September 2012) She received first prize in international competitions in both Murano, Italy (1996) and Ebeltoft, Denmark (1997) for her sculptures in stone and glass.Dwinger, Jonna: Varieret ung glaskunst, Dansk kunsth√•ndv√¶rker blandt prismodtagerne ved Young Glass 97, Politikken 8 June 1997, Danmark Projects  She has been involved in several projects, often in collaboration with her husband Lars Widenfalk, a sculptor who works mainly with stone; usually marble and granite, but also with other materials such as glass. Artlantis is one of these projects, themed around the myth of Atlantis, and consisting of eight glass water containers. In four of these containers Matejka placed four granite houses, of varying sizes and architectural styles. Over the houses, hanging in the water, are small sculptures shaped like flowers, boats, doll heads and three hundred glass beads. These are all made of a special glass that reflects light in a distinctive way. Matejka's contribution was more the dreamy, fantasies and thoughts. Lars Widenfalk chose a more concrete or archaeological approach, with its granite sculptures of humans with live fish in the water containers.Artlantis Project ‚Äì www.matejkova.com (accessed 15 September 2012) Bed of Roses is made of ice and roses under the stay in Lule√• Winter Biennial.

It is possible that Varronianus was the young man referred to by John Chrysostom in two of his letters and homilies (\\"Homilies on Philippians\\" and \\"Letter to a Young Widow\\"). If so, it appears that Varronianus was still alive in AD 380, but was living in fear of his life, due to his imperial descent. At some point, he had one of his eyes removed, probably in an attempt to prevent him from making a claim to the throne.Scott McGill, Cristiana Sogno, Edward Watts, From the Tetrarchs to the Theodosians: Later Roman History and Culture, 284-450 CE (2010), pg. 245Edward Gibbon , \\"The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\\", vol. 2, chapter 25 Sources * Martindale, J.

With her adoptive mother, Elaine DePrince, Michaela authored the book Taking Flight: From War Orphan to Star Ballerina.Taking Flight: From War Orphan to Star Ballerina at Amazon. She rose to fame after starring in the documentary First Position in 2011, following her and other young ballet dancers as they prepared to compete at the Youth America Grand Prix. She formerly danced with the Dance Theatre of Harlem as the youngest dancer in the history of the company and currently dances as a soloist for the Dutch National Ballet. Since 2016 Michaela is a goodwill ambassador with the Dutch organisation War Child, based in Amsterdam. Early life Born as Mabinty Bangura into a Muslim family,Smith, David, \\"Sierra Leone war orphan returns to Africa en pointe for ballet debut\\", The Guardian, 16 July 2012. she grew up as an orphan in Sierra Leone after her uncle brought her to an orphanage during the civil war. Her adoptive parents were told that her father was shot and killed by the Revolutionary United Front when she was three years old, and that her mother starved to death soon after. Frequently malnourished, mistreated, and derided as a \\"devil's child\\" because of vitiligo, a skin condition causing depigmentation, she fled to a refugee camp after her orphanage was bombed. In 1999, at the age of four, she and another girl, also named Mabinty (later given the name Mia), were adopted by Elaine and Charles DePrince, a Jewish couple from Cherry Hill, New Jersey, and taken to the United States.Marquis, Cate, \\"Ballet documentary defies stereotypes\\", STL Jewish Light, 16 May 2012.

She trained in classical ballet at The Rock School for Dance Education in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Concurrent with intense ballet training, DePrince took online classes through Keystone National High School, where she earned her high school diploma.

DePrince was awarded a scholarship to study at the American Ballet Theatre's Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis School of Ballet for her performance at the Youth America Grand Prix. She pursued a professional career despite encountering instances of racial discrimination: aged eight, she was told that she couldn't perform as Marie in The Nutcracker because \\"America's not ready for a black girl ballerina\\", and a year later, a teacher told her mother that black dancers weren't worth investing money in. DePrince was one of the stars of the 2011 documentary film First Position, which follows six young dancers vying for a place in an elite ballet company or school, and performed on the TV show Dancing with the Stars. In 2011 she made her European debut in Abdallah and the Gazelle of Basra with De Dutch Don't Dance Division (Dance Company The Hague, NL), The Hague, Netherlands. She came back there a year later to dance The Sugar Plum Fairy in The Nutcracker at the Lucent Dance Theatre. In 2012, she graduated from the American Ballet Theatre's Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis School in New York, and joined the Dance Theatre of Harlem, where she was the youngest member of the company.Mackrell, Judith (28 November 2013), \\"Everyday racism: how to be a black ballet dancer in a white world\\", The Guardian. Her professional debut performance was in the role of Gulnare in Mzansi Productions and the South African Ballet Theatre's premiere of Le Corsaire on 19 July 2012. In July 2013, she joined the junior company of the Dutch National Ballet, based in Amsterdam. In August 2014 she joined the Dutch National Ballet as an √©leve. In 2015 she was promoted to the rank of Coryph√©e. In 2016 she was promoted to the rank of grand sujet, and then to soloist at the end of the same year.\\"Michaela DePrince CV\\", Nationale Opera & Ballet.

Passenger service to Union Station ran from 1851 until 1960, and commuter service also briefly ran from 1980 to 1986. Restoration of passenger service was considered in the early 2000s, but was rejected due to low cost-effectiveness. History Union Station in 1910 The \\"Biggest Chair\\" at Gardner station around 1910 Gardner gained train service on the Fitchburg Railroad (via the Vermont & Massachusetts) in 1851. Located at the intersection of the Fitchburg Railroad with the Boston, Barre and Gardner Railroad (which began service to Worcester in 1871), Gardner once had a large union station which was angled to serve both lines. The Fitchburg bought the BB&G; in 1885, and was itself bought by the Boston and Maine Railroad in 1900. The \\"Biggest Chair\\", a 12-foot-tall chair made by a local company, was placed in the station lawn around 1910. Passenger service to Worcester ended in March 1953, and service to Boston ended in 1960 when the B&M; discontinued all trains west of Fitchburg, ending more than a century of rail service. Union Station was demolished soon after. On December 27, 1976, the MBTA bought the Boston and Maine Railroad's northside commuter rail assets, including the entire length of the Fitchburg Line. The closure of the Lexington Branch the next month represented the limit of the contraction of the northside lines; as a result of the 1970s energy crisis and especially the 1979 energy crisis, a period of rapid expansion began in the end of the 1970s. On January 13, 1980, the MBTA extended commuter service on the Fitchburg Line from South Acton, with two round trips extended as far as Gardner. Trains did not stop at the former Union Station site, but instead at a narrow asphalt platform in the freight yard just to the west off Main Street. Service to Gardner ended seven years later on January 1, 1987, due to a dispute between the MBTA, Amtrak (who ran the trains), and Guilford Transportation (who owned the tracks between Fitchburg and Gardner). The MBTA contracted with Wilson Bus Lines to run Gardner-Fitchburg connecting service until June 1993, when the Montachusett Regional Transit Authority took over the route as a local service. =Proposed restoration= Old platform (in background) next to the newer MART garage Restoring commuter rail service to Gardner has been considered since 1987. In 2000, the Massachusetts State Legislature passed a bill that directed the MBTA to \\"conduct a feasibility study regarding the reestablishment of the commuter rail line to the cities of Gardner and Athol on the existing Fitchburg/Gardner/Athol spur line\\" as one of many expansion and improvement projects. However, restoration of service was deemed impractical for several reasons. Gardner is 64 miles and Athol 81 miles by rail for North Station - outside normal commuting distances. The line between Fitchburg and Gardner would cost $104.2 million to double track, and speeds are limited due to the grades going through the Mount Wachusett range. Because the Route 2 expressway is faster along the corridor than rail service would be, the expansion was projected to attract just 50 riders per day. (Ridership at the former station was just 24 riders per day in 1983 - the lowest among regular stops on the system.) Instead, it was decided to extend the Fitchburg Line 4.5 miles to a new station at Wachusett, which opened in September 2016 with a park-and-ride lot off Route 2 expected to attract 400 riders per day. The 1980s platform still exists; it became overgrown for a time but was later cleared off for freight yard access. Beginning in 2007, MART built a new bus garage on the site of the former freight house, which burned in 2002. An MBTA \\"T\\" roundel sign, which had remained for two decades after the end of service, was removed during construction. The new garage includes provisions for a platform should rail service ever return. Bus connections Even without rail service, Gardner serves as a hub for MART bus service. Two local routes, two interurban routes with local stops, and one intercity route operate from Gardner: *Gardner Route 1 *Gardner Route 2 *G-Link Gardner-Orange *G-Link Gardner- Winchendon *MWCC Commuter Rail/Intercity (runs to Fitchburg station to connect with commuter rail) MART also offers direct service from Gardner to Wachusett.

Harvard et al; Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2011, 6:54; are rare aberrations of human chromosome 1. In a common situation a human cell has one pair of identical chromosomes on chromosome 1. With the 1q21.1 CNVs one chromosome of the pair is not complete because a part of the sequence of the chromosome is missing, or overcomplete, because some parts of the sequence are duplicated. The result is that one chromosome is of normal length and the other one is too long or too short. The structure of 1q21.1 The structure of 1q21.1 is complex. The area has a size of approximately 6 Megabase (Mb) (from 141.5 Mb to 147.9 Mb). Within 1q21.1 there are two areas where the CNVs can be found: the proximal area or TAR area (144.1 to 144.5) and the distal area (144.7 to 145.9). A 1q21.1 CNV will commonly be found in one of these areas, but an overlap with the other area or parts that are outside these areas are possible. 1q21.1 has multiple repetitions of the same structure (areas with the same color in the picture have equal structures) Only 25% of the structure is not duplicated. There are several gaps in the sequence. There is no further information available about the DNA-sequence in those areas up till now. The gaps represent approximately 700 Kilobase. New genes are expected in the gaps. The area of 1q21.1 is one of the most difficult parts of the human genome to map. CNVs occur due to non- allelic homologous recombination mediated by low copy repeats (sequentially similar regions).  Forms of 1q21.1 CNVs  Four separate forms of 1q21.1 CNVs are mentioned in literature. * the 1q21.1 proximal deletions and duplications * the TAR syndrome * the distal deletion, known as the 1q21.1 deletion syndrome * the distal duplication, known as the 1q21.1 duplication syndrome The CNVs lead to a very variable phenotype and the manifestations in individuals are quite variable. Some people who have a CNV can function in a normal way, while others have symptoms of mental retardation and various physical anomalies. Cause of the syndrome Meiosis is the process of dividing cells in humans. In meiosis, the chromosome pairs splits and a representative of each pair goes to one daughter cell. In this way the number of chromosomes will be halved in each cell, while all the parts on the chromosome (genes) remain, after being randomized. Which information of the parent cell ends up in the daughter cell is purely decided by chance. Besides this random process, there is a second random process. In this second random process the DNA will be scrambled in a way that pieces are omitted (deletion), added (duplication), moved from one place to another (translocation) and inverted (inversion). This is a common process, which leads to about 0,4% variation in the DNA. It explains why even identical twins are not genetically 100% identical. Problem of the second random process is that genetic mistakes can occur. Especially due to the deletion and duplication process, the chromosomes that come together in a new cell may be shorter or longer. The result of this spontaneous change in the structure of DNA is a so-called copy number variation. Due to the CNV chromosomes of different sizes can be combined in a new cell. If this occurs around conception, the result will be a first cell of a human with a genetic variation. This can be either positive or negative. In positive cases this new human will be capable of a special skill that is assessed positively, for example, in sports or science. In negative cases, you have to deal with a syndrome or a severe disability, as in this case the 1q21.1 CNVs. Based on the meiotic process, the syndrome may occur in two ways. *1. a spontaneous deviation (a 'de novo' situation): two chromosomes come together of which one has a copy number variation as a result of the meiosis process. *2. a parent is unknowingly carrier of a chromosome with a copy number variation and passes it through at conception to the child, with different consequences for the child. Due to this genetic misprint the embryo may experience problems in the development during the first months of pregnancy. Approximately 20 to 40 days after fertilization, something goes wrong in the construction of the body parts and brain, which leads to a chain reaction. Because of the repetitions in 1q21.1, there is a larger chance on an unequal crossing-over during meiosis. Related genes Genes related to the proximal area are HFE2, TXNIP, POLR3GL, LIX1L, RBM8A, PEX11B, ITGA10, ANKRD35, PIAS3, NUDT17, POLR3C, RNF115, CD160, PDZK1, and GPR89A Genes related to the distal area are PDE4DIP, HYDIN2, PRKAB2, PDIA3P, FMO5, CHD1L, BCL9, ACP6, GJA5, GJA8, NBPF10, GPR89B, GPR89C, PDZK1P1 and NBPF11.

The film produced by Prem Prakash was written by his sons Bobby and Sanjay. It stars Prithviraj Sukumaran, Pratap Pothen, Narain, Samvrutha Sunil, Rima Kallingal, and Remya Nambeesan. Ayalum Njanum Thammil is a story of a committed senior doctor and an irresponsible junior doctor. Through their relationship, a vivid picture of the medical profession is drawn. The soundtrack and background score were composed by Ouseppachan. The film was released on 19 October 2012 to widespread critical acclaim. It won four Kerala State Film Awards, including Best Popular Film, Best Director, and Best Actor for Prithviraj. Plot Dr. Ravi Tharakan (Prithviraj Sukumaran) is a renowned cardiothoracic surgeon working in a private hospital. The plot begins with a traumatised girl being brought to the hospital. Ravi decides to operate on the girl for free, against the wishes of her father. The girl dies during the surgery. Her father and a few local politicians accuse Ravi for the death and protest in the hospital. Ravi is forced to flee through the back door, followed by the girl's relatives. He has an accident on the way and goes missing without any trace. The girl's death gains media attention, and the police start a thorough search for Ravi. The hospital management clears its name by sacking Ravi, but the chairman's private secretary Diya (Rima Kallingal) expresses dissatisfaction over the hospital's decision and starts a search on her own. She is very much attached to Ravi, who had once convinced her the importance of following ethics in the medical profession. She meets Dr. Vivek (Narain), who is a very close friend and a former classmate of Ravi. At the private medical college where Ravi completed his medical degree, he and Vivek were amongst the worst students. They were irresponsible in their studies and were not even able to distinguish between surgical instruments. Ravi had a campus romance, a junior Muslim student named Sainaba aka Sainu (Samvrutha). After completing the course, Ravi and Vivek were left with two options: either to pay the college 5 lakh or to do an internship in a village hospital. Vivek opts to pay. Ravi, who is not able to get the cash from his father Thomas Tharakan (Prem Prakash), chooses to work in the Redemption Hospital in Munnar, which is run by Dr. Samuel (Prathap Pothen) ‚Äî an altruistic physician who, by his absolute devotion to his profession, lives a lonely life. On his way to Munnar, Ravi's car crashes with a police vehicle. and Ravi is in turn harassed by S. I. Purushothaman (Kalabhavan Mani). Ravi lodges a complaint and gets the officer suspended. Ravi initially finds the job at the hospital uninteresting, mainly due to the uncompromising Samuel, who is very strict. He hates the lonely stay in a \\"jail-like\\" staff-quarters. The only consolations for Ravi are the letters by Sainu and occasional phone calls to Vivek. Ravi is soon accompanied by Dr. Supriya (Remya Nambeesan), another junior doctor, who helps him develop an interest in the job. However, he still finds it difficult to adjust to Samuel. Some months later, Samuel informs Ravi about a phone call that he received from Sainu's parents, who are planning to marry Sainu to someone else. Samuel was also asked to forbid Ravi from meeting or calling her. Ravi seeks help from Vivek, who secretly makes all arrangements for Ravi's and Sainu's marriage in Kochi, but Ravi is stopped by Purushothaman on his way to Kochi, in the name of a routine check. The officer who was actually waiting to avenge his suspension does not leave Ravi even after hearing about the marriage. Ravi arrives late only to see a house arrested Sainu, who has unwillingly agreed for another marriage. This incident shakes Ravi completely. His lonely stay in Munnar also haunts him, but he is able to be sincere to his job. One day, a girl is brought to the hospital in a serious condition. Ravi, the only duty doctor, rushes to her but decides not to attend the case after knowing that she is Purushothaman's daughter. He rejects the requests of hospital staff and other inmates. Not even the tears shed by Purushothaman at his feet are enough to melt his heart. The girl's condition becomes very serious, but she is saved by Samuel, who arrives sometime later. An angry Samuel slaps Ravi for his negligence. Insulted, Ravi decides to leave the place immediately but is stopped by Supriya, who supports Samuel's action. The next day, Ravi is summoned by a committee for investigation of a complaint filed by Purushothaman. Ravi is silent throughout the interrogation, and the committee decides to recommend that the Medical Council cancel his recognition. However, Samuel testifies for Ravi stating that Ravi is innocent and since the girl is saved, there arises no case of medical negligence. This incident and Samuel's testifying turns out to be an eye-opener for Ravi. His attitude to the purpose of life changes completely which he is able to follow throughout his later life. He leaves Redemption Hospital after his internship and leaves for London to pursue his higher studies, and later works in hospitals and gains a name for being service- minded. Having known more about Ravi from Vivek and Supriya, Diya comes to the conclusion that Ravi might have gone to meet Samuel. The police also tracks him at Munnar after tracing his phone calls. In a cemetery, Ravi is shown talking to Samuel about the girl's death, but it is later shown that Samuel is no more and that it was the news of Samuel's death that brought Ravi to Munnar. Ravi is arrested by the police and is brought to court. He is acquitted in the case after the dead girl's mother testifies for Ravi stating that it was upon her behest that Ravi opted to operate the girl.

DGEN  The DGEN program aims at developing a family of high-bypass-ratio two-spool unmixed-flow jet engines (turbofans) - the DGEN 380 and 390 - intended to equip 4- to 6-seat aircraft in a twin-engine configuration with a maximum take-off weight (MTOW) between 1400 and 2150 kg. The DGEN engines are recognizedPrice induction toujours √† la recherche d‚Äôun avionneur, Aerobuzz, April 2011 as being the only turbofans designed for the flight envelope of the general aviation (altitude under 25,000 ft, speed under Mach 0,35).

The airfield caters to recreational aircraft owners and pilots, all of whom are members of the New South Wales Sport Aircraft Club.Welcome to the NSW Sport Aircraft Club Website Overview The airfield was established to provide club members with a low cost option for owning and operating their aircraft. The operating costs of the airfield are paid through club membership fees and leasing of hangar space. The grounds are maintained by a caretaker who resides on site. It is reported that the annual operating cost under this model is approximately $65,000.Williamsdale Airfield Cost Benefit Analysis The airfield has become more popular with recreational flyers following the closure of Hoxton Park Airport in 2008. Upgrades to airport facilities have been completed progressively as funds permit and include the sealing of the entire length of runway 17/35 in 2008 and ongoing works to seal the apron and taxiway areas. In addition to regular flying club events, Wedderburn holds an annual open day and fly-in, an event that includes displays of a variety of home-built, ultralight, historic and military aircraft as well a barbecue and family friendly activities. The event is intended to be a social gathering for club members and an opportunity for interested members of the community to look around the facilities. In previous years, money raised has been donated to organisations such as CareFlight.NSW Sport Aircraft Club Inc Wedderburn Open Day Facilities Wedderburn airfield has a single runway, aligned 17/35 measuring approximately long. The strip has been progressively upgraded using funding from club members and was sealed to full length in 2008. There is currently no night lighting available, limiting the airport to daytime visual flight rules operation only. As Wedderburn caters to small recreational and general aviation category aircraft, the facilities are limited to use by aircraft not exceeding maximum takeoff weight. There is no control tower at the airfield, so pilots are required to coordinate takeoff and landings using a discrete Common Traffic Advisory Frequency. Weather information is available from nearby Camden Airport. Fuel (Avgas) is available and the site houses close to 100 hangars for the storage of members' aircraft. Accidents and incidents *On 2 May 1992 a Jodel D11 aircraft, registration VH-CKY suffered an engine failure shortly after becoming airborne at Wedderburn. The pilot attempted a left turn back towards the runway, but had insufficient height or speed to control the aircraft, which crashed nose down into trees. The pilot was killed in the accident and was the only person on board at the time.Aviation Safety Investigation Report 199201747 *On 22 June 2003 a Cessna 172 registration VH-TUR operating a private flight to Bankstown Airport in Sydney with four people on board rolled to the right and crashed shortly after takeoff at Wedderburn.

It is also referred to as the Peter Behrens Building (Peter-Behrens-Bau) by the operator of the H√∂chst Industrial Park, as the site of the former Hoechst works has been called since the merger of Hoechst AG and other companies and the subsequent abandonment of the traditional corporate name. The building had worldwide fame in a stylised form as part as the Hoechst company's tower and bridge (Turm und Br√ºcke) logo from 1947 to 1997. The related complex of buildings listed below is divided into two three-story administrative wings and a representative entrance area with its distinctive tower and bridge, linked to the building of the former central office (Hauptcomptoir) of the Hoechst company. It is accessible only to the public on specific days, because it is located in the cordoned-off area of the industrial park. Because of its importance for industrial heritage, it is part of the Route of Industrial Heritage of the Rhine-Main (Route der Industriekultur Rhein-Main). History =1920 to 1924 - Design and construction= In June 1920, the Executive Board of Hoechst under its Director-General Adolf Haeuser, decided to merge its technical departments, which had been widely scattered, in a prestigious new building on the old Mainzer Landstrasse (now Br√ºningstra√üe) in the eastern part of the then independent city of H√∂chst am Main. The facade of the new administration building would be at least 150 metres long. A plot was selected for this building next to the former central office, built in 1892. On 21 August, a request was made to the Berlin-based architect Peter Behrens, who immediately prepared the first drafts, so that on 14 September, a contract was signed for the new technical offices of the dye works. On 31 December 1920, the building department was presented with a proposed design and in January demolition of older buildings on the plot began. At the end of 1921, the building's shell was largely completed, but further work on the building was delayed. In particular, the lack of building materials during the years of hyperinflation and the occupation of the H√∂chst works by French troops on 5 May 1923 brought construction to a standstill at times until the introduction of the German Rentenmark in April 1924. The formal opening of the monumental office building was held on 6 June 1924. =1925-1945‚ÄîIG Farben= The new building soon lost importance as, on 12 November 1925, the Hoechst dye works was merged with other chemical companies to form IG Farben. In 1930, the administration of the then fourth-largest company in the world was transferred to the new IG Farben Building in Frankfurt's West End, designed by Hans Poelzig. The H√∂chst factory declined further in the next few years. In the 1930s several alterations were made inside the building as a result. Thus, the aisles of the big exhibition hall on the ground floor were converted into a telephone exchange for the factory and warehouses. The large conference room on the first and second floor, known as the marble hall (Marmorsaal), was divided into three offices. The Second World War left the H√∂chst work largely undamaged. The site was only hit by bombs on 29 June 1940 during an air raid, which devastated the lecture hall in the northern building. It was repaired during the war in a simplified form and renovated in 1951 in the style of the 1950s. =After the Second World War= Technical Administration Building in the mid 1950s In June 1952, IG Farben was released from Allied control. The company was liquidated and divided into eleven successor companies, including Hoechst AG. In 1954, Br√ºningstra√üe adjacent to the building was closed to public traffic. In 1965 all buildings at the Hoechst works were given new names in a uniform style. Since then the building built by Behrens has been called C 770 and the central office building opposite has been called D 706. The building built by Behrens became the location of the personnel department. =Infraserv= The conversion of Hoechst AG into a holding company began in 1994. Since 1 January 1998, the Behrens building has been owned by Infraserv GmbH & Co. H√∂chst KG, the operator of the H√∂chst industrial park (Industriepark H√∂chst), which was spun off Hoechst AG. An extensive restoration of the Behrens building began in 1998. Its facade was cleaned and repaired, all the windows and the building's services were replaced. The restoration was completed in 2002. In 2005, the auditorium was modernised and the Marble Hall on the second floor was renovated, with the building's original wooden panelling, which had been covered, now largely exposed. The exhibition hall, which had been heavily modified by alterations, was renovated in 2007 and restored as much as possible to its original state. The Behrens building is now the headquarters of the management of Infraserv H√∂chst and the Hoechst pension fund. The building is not accessible to the public, but can be seen as part of special guided tours on several days each year. Building Specifications Tower of the Behrens building with its distinctive clock Architectural detail of the bridge =Basics= The building's association with brick expressionism is reflected in both the external and internal architecture and can be recognised from the details. Central themes are the colours that refer to the client and the crystal motifs that can be seen as ornaments in the light sources, such as windows and lamps. The stained glass windows also quote the paintings of the De Stijl artistic movement. While Peter Behrens had extensive experience in construction for industry and government, the importance of craft work can also be seen in his work after the First World War. This meant that many components such as door handles, railings or single windows were finished by hand. =Facade= For cost reasons, and in contrast to the historicist central office building lying opposite, the technical administration building was built completely of brick. Behrens avoided a monotonous facade to the 185-metre long building complex by the fact that he used different coloured bricks and he divided the long building into three sections. The two wings of the office building converge at an obtuse angle from the entrance building, which has a fortress-like wall at its base, tapering towards the top. The windows are inset in sockets and are square and relatively small. This vertical dominance is broken by single horizontal friezes of bright broken masonry. The upper floors are set back and are built with parabolic-shaped windows, reminiscent of Gothic arches, as a defining element. =Bridge, tower and mid-section= The bridge and the tower are the two key elements of the complex. The middle section contains the main entrance and main staircase of the building. Its facade resembles that of the wings of the building, but has more emphasis on vertical elements. While topped with parabolic windows, the middle section has narrow columns of window. The tower dominates the middle section. In the upper area are the openings for chimes and a clock. Despite the existence of the bells chimes, it was never completed for cost reasons. Originally it was intended to signal the change of shift to the workers in the dye works with the sounds of Richard Wagner's Lohengrin. The tower was connected to the central office building built in 1892 with a masonry arch bridge over Br√ºningstra√üe that reflects the theme of the parabolic windows of the upper floor. The main entrance in the central block is built very cautiously as a representative feature. The three doors are recessed into the window gaps. Above the entrance there are two stone lions carved with the arms of the Meister, Lucius & Br√ºning company, which developed into the Hoechst company. =Interior Design= Entrance, main hall and staircase exhibition  Vertical view of the entrance hall Exhibition space with the workers' statue The main hall can be compared to the nave of a basilica that is connected to the entrance via a transept. The transept, which is the passage from the three entrances to the hall, is very low and dark, and thus forms a contrast to the impressive main hall. The hall occupies the entire height of the central building and is illuminated by large windows in the ceiling. Its height of 15 metres is stretched visually by several architectural tools. The individual storeys of the peripheral course are lower at the top and the windows are narrower. The only ornament in this hall is the bare masonry of the pillars that form a frame to the octagonal ceiling windows above and taper down. An alternate colour scheme counteracts the massiveness of the upper very broad masonry: the lowest clinker bricks are green, followed by blue, red, purple, orange and finally yellow. It was designed as a three-aisled hall, with the seven-metre high ceiling supported by six pillars, and is illuminated through large, coloured glass windows on three sides. This architecture, as well as the large windows appropriate for the lighting was changed over time in many cases. Already in the 1930s the area was transformed into a memorial for those killed as a result of World War II. In 1938, the aisles were separated by concrete floors and divided into several rooms, the first as a switchboard for the works and since the 1960s rooms have served as a storeroom and conference rooms. A statue of a worker with roll up sleeves, created by Richard Scheibe, was the only original feature that remained in the exhibition hall. From June to December 2007, the hall was restored to its original form, with the windows and walls rebuilt to the original design. The bright colours of the new brick stand out clearly from the original bricks of the entrance hall, which have faded over the decades, conveying an impression of Behren's original plans. The main stairs are located at the ends of the nave. They run over the balustrade of the mezzanine floors of the main hall to the third floor. The main staircase now contains an elevator that goes up to the fourth floor. The window facing the courtyard are painted in the colours of the mezzanine. Lecture hall and marble hall The auditorium of the Behrens building was located on the first floor above the showroom. The original hall was designed in accordance with the overall concept and had elaborate wood panelling. After it was burned during the Second World War, it was rebuilt in the 1950s in the style of that time. {  valign=top  View of the lecture hall  valign=top  Looking down from the top of the lecture hall } Opposite, above the entrance, was a hall known as the Marble Hall (Marmorsaal). It owes its name to its wall cladding of travertine, which is reminiscent of marble. A particular feature was the candlestick, which was also designed by Behrens. An exit to the bridge linked this space directly with the central office building opposite. As part of a reorganisation, the Marble Hall was divided into three separate offices and the candlestick also disappeared. Office suites and courtyard The office wings are close to the central structure. They are situated around a courtyard, which has walls that are veneered with white bricks so that incidental light is reflected up the surrounding corridors. The transitions to the offices are more simply built than the representative main hall. The dominant material is wood. In the office wings there are two small adjoining staircases at the end of the east wing and at the centre of the west wing. In both stairwells a paternoster lift operates and in the west wing there is also a freight elevator. In the north-west wing of the Behrens building there were originally the offices of the drafting rooms of the technical departments. Later, the rooms were divided into numerous individual rooms. {  valign=top View of the courtyard  valign=top Wood-paneled interior corridor of the office building  valign=top Internal walkway to the entrance hall lined with clinker bricks } Notes  References   External links  * Buildings and structures in Frankfurt Brick Expressionism Modernist architecture in Germany ","title":"Technical Administration Building of Hoechst AG"},{"id":"36460434","text":"Patricia \\"Pat\\" Neder (born December 14, 1966 in Waukesha, Wisconsin) is an American former handball player who competed in the 1992 Summer Olympics and in the 1996 Summer Olympics.

Rebuilt Rossi-Cerchi Tower History The present tower is a reconstruction after the prior structure was entirely razed by mining to destroy all the Florentine bridges over the Arno by retreating German forces during World War Two. The tower was built in the early 1200s by the Guelph Rossi family. The tower and the adjacent house were partially destroyed, after the Ghibelline victory at the Battle of Montaperti and the property was inherited at first by the Cerchi family, and later by the Canigiani family.Le torri di Firenze, by Lara Mercanti and Giovanni Straffi, Firenze, Alinea, 2003, page 156. The structure is presently part of the Hotel Pitti Palace al Ponte Vecchio. Bacchus Fountain  A statue of Bacchus is now present in a niche created in the tower. At the site, this statue was previously a fountain with a Roman Sarcophagus, a grouping which had been assembled in 1838. The Sarcophagus was destroyed in the World War. The statue was attributed to Giambologna. The present statue is a copy of the original now kept in the Bargello. Before the statue of Bacchus, the site had a statue of Centaurus, also by Giambologna, now moved to the Loggia della Signoria.

Mitochondria possess their own ribosomes responsible for the synthesis of a small number of proteins encoded by the mitochondrial genome. VAR1 is the only protein in the yeast mitochondrial ribosome to be encoded in the mitochondria - the remaining approximately 80 ribosomal proteins are encoded in the nucleus. VAR1 along with 15S rRNA are necessary for the formation of mature 37S subunits. Function It is thought that Var1 plays a role in the early steps of small subunit assembly and is required for the incorporation of at least one ribosomal protein. It is important for mitochondrial translational initiation, since it requires the interaction between the small ribosomal subunit and the message-specific translation factors. Ribosomal proteins in translation Ribosomes are the organelles that catalyse mRNA-directed protein synthesis in all organisms. The codons of the mRNA are exposed on the ribosome to allow tRNA binding. This leads to the incorporation of amino acids into the growing polypeptide chain in accordance with the genetic information. Incoming amino acid monomers enter the ribosomal A site in the form of aminoacyl-tRNAs complexed with elongation factor Tu (EF- Tu) and GTP. The growing polypeptide chain, situated in the P site as peptidyl-tRNA, is then transferred to aminoacyl-tRNA and the new peptidyl- tRNA, extended by one residue, is translocated to the P site with the aid the elongation factor G (EF-G) and GTP as the deacylated tRNA is released from the ribosome through one or more exit sites. Since Var1 helps form the small subunit of the ribosome, its significance become apparent in translation and cell survival.

Vanunu, a former Israeli nuclear technician at the Negev Nuclear Research Center, had left Israel and leaked secrets about Israel's nuclear program to the British media. Vanunu was successfully abducted after being lured to Rome and was smuggled to Israel by sea. He was tried, convicted, and sentenced to 18 years in prison.

The ride's name is inspired by the Congo River located in Africa. History Six Flags Astroworld and Intamin AG partnered in 1979 to build the world's first river rapids ride in 1980 called Thunder River. The popularity of Thunder River caused the start of the construction of another rapids ride, Roaring Rapids, at Six Flags Great Adventure in 1980. It was modeled after the kayak slalom course that was built in West Germany for the 1972 Summer Olympics. It was constructed in place of one of the park's first attractions, The Great Train Ride. After construction, it made its public debut at the park on June 16, 1981. After its debut, Roaring Rapids at Great Adventure received major modifications to get guests wetter with a safer ride experience. In 1991, Roaring Rapids received a new name, Congo Rapids, with the new theme area Adventure Rivers. Today, the river rapids is located in Adventure Seaport, along with Nitro and two kids areas: Safari Kids and Looney Tunes Seaport. Congo Rapids operates from Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend. Ride Once the twelve riders strap themselves into one of the twelve boats, the boat leaves the station to a canyon-themed, man-made river. During the ride, there are different objects in the water that disrupt the flow of the water creating rapids in the attraction. Also, the ride features waterfalls at the end of the course of the ride as another way to get riders completely soaked. Once riders go through the course of the ride, the boat will reach to one of the lifts to take the boat ~~s~~ back to the station. Congo Rapids features dual loading stations, where boats can be loaded twice as fast than one loading station.  Incidents  = Goose Stuck in Ride = On July 15, 2012, a goose was trapped in the conveyor belt of the ride and was resistant to fly away despite the attempts of the ride's staff. To save the goose, the operators would have to halt the rides already in motion making the exit from the ride dangerous for the passengers. Ultimately the staff decided to let the ride proceed, thus killing the goose that was stuck in the conveyor belt. Following the events, a representative of a goose endangerment protection organization named GooseWatch NJ, said, in reaction to the event, that they were ‚Äúdisturbed and saddened‚Äù by the staff's decision. The representative suggested that the park put in extra precautions into their attractions to prevent more of these incidents from occurring. To convince the park to do so the organization filed a request to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to investigate the incident. The spokeswoman of Six Flags at the time defended the decision of the ride's staff to not endanger the lives of the passengers in place of the goose's. Her reasoning for defending their decision is due to the dangerous process of evacuating the passengers which involves flushing the rafts into the ride's reservoir and having the riders exit the raft by a rope climb. There has been no follow-up on the result of the request filed to the USDA.

Structure Resolution of the crystal structure of the VHS domain of Drosophila Hrs and human Tom1 revealed that it consists of eight helices arranged in a double-layer superhelix. The existence of conserved patches of residues on the domain surface suggests that VHS domains may be involved in protein-protein recognition and docking.

It was registered with the Flag Institute as a regional flag in 2012. History In April 2012 the Black Country Living Museum launched a competition to design a flag for the Black Country. The competition was launched in response to a campaign by the Parliamentary Flags & Heraldry Committee, encouraging local communities to develop their own flags to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II and the United Kingdom's hosting of the Olympics during 2012. After 1,500 votes were cast by members of the public, a design by 11-year-old Gracie Sheppard was chosen as the winning entry. The creation of the flag was used as the catalyst for starting an official Black Country Day, established in 2013, and a Black Country Festival, established in 2014. Black Country Day was first introduced in March, but later moved to July 14 to mark the anniversary of the invention of the Newcomen beam engine. Design The Fountain Inn, Tipton flying the flag The flag owes its design to a quote made in 1862 by Elihu Burritt, the American Consul in Birmingham. He described the region as \\"black by day and red by night\\" ‚Äî a result of the local factory furnaces giving out smoke and grime during the day, and glowing by night. The flag background is therefore both black and red, with the chains showing a typical metal product manufactured in the area. The central white area represents the glass cone, a symbol of the region's glass-making heritage since 1790. The Pantone colours for the flag are: *Black *White *Red 186 C Flying the flag  Worcester Cathedral flying the Black Country Flag. The flag is one of very few regional, non-historic county, flags that may be flown without consent of a local planning authority, providing the flag is \\"maintained in a condition that does not impair the overall visual appearance of the site\\" and does not block official signs (such as road signs).\\"The flag of the Black Country, East Anglia, Wessex, any Part of Lincolnshire, any Riding of Yorkshire or any historic county within the United Kingdom\\" () In 2013, on Black Country Day (14 July), the Black Country flag was flown alongside the United Kingdom's Union flag, at Eland House, the headquarters of the Department for Communities and Local Government in Victoria, London.  Accusations of racist connotations  In July 2015, historian and campaigner Patrick Vernon said the use of chains on the flag represented a disturbing image of an industry that profited from slavery and colonial rule in Africa. Dudley Council leader Pete Lowe demanded Vernon apologise for \\"his divisive words\\" and hand back his OBE award. Vernon defended his views, writing in the Express & Star, \\"That is why I find the Black Country Day logo offensive, as the foundries and factories made chains, fetters, collars, padlocks and manacles which were used on slave ships from Africa and in the plantations during slavery in the Caribbean and North America. The iron was used for trading by merchants for exchange in Africa. Such was the extent of this trade, Henry Waldram, a Wolverhampton ironmaker, advertised his specialism in Sketchley's and Adam's Universal Directory of 1770 as 'Negro Collar & Handcuff maker'.\\" In July 2017, West Midlands newspaper the Express & Star reported that then recently elected local Labour MP Eleanor Smith had described the flag as \\"racist\\" and \\"offensive\\" and wanted it to be scrapped, citing possible slavery connotations of the chain imagery and colours. Responding to criticism, Smith said the flag made her feel \\"uneasy and unwelcome\\", and that she had been expressing the concerns of some constituents, but denied having ever described it as \\"racist\\". Dudley South Conservative MP Mike Wood raised criticism of Smith in the House of Commons, inviting Theresa May, Prime Minister at the time, to endorse the flag design. May commended the flag and praised Gracie Sheppard for its design. Writing in The Guardian in July 2017, University of Manchester historian of class and race Matthew Stallard responded, \\"It is, however, a historical fact that the Black Country was a key provider of metalworked goods to the slave trade and plantation economies of the Americas and throughout the British Empire. Scholars have consistently demonstrated the inherently interlinked nature of industrial development in all areas of the UK and imperial expansion, whether directly by trading British goods for people, using slave-produced raw materials, or the sale and use of British-made goods in slave or colonial economies.\\" In July 2020, senior management at West Midlands Fire Service reportedly asked fire stations in the region not to display the flag on Black Country Day due to concerns the imagery of a chain could have links to slavery. According to the Express & Star, fire fighters asked for the decision to be overturned, describing it as ‚Äúdivisive‚Äù and ‚Äúshort-sighted‚Äù.

HIZETJITWA is an acronym made up of the first letters of the names of the indigenous tribes that are the focus of the organisation: Himba people, Zemba people, Tjimba people and Twa people. These native, semi nomadic people live in the mountainous and semi deserted areas of North West Kunene in Namibia and Angola. Individuals belonging to the Herero people in northern Kunene and from the Omusati Region (Ruacana area), are also members of HIPO. The executive director is Tjinezuma Kavari. Founding HIPO was launched by the local people in 2007 and had by 2012 established committees in 85 communities, and an estimated membership of between 1,500 and 3,000. Around 40% of the members and 33% of the local committees are female, a good result in an otherwise male-dominated culture. Realising that continuing to be illiterate was detrimental to their culture and way of life, a special focus of the organisation is education. HIPO works on 5-year plans, annual plans and 3-month plans as approved by the board. For 2010 the budget is N$980,000, including 80,000 for efforts in establishing a HIPO organization in Angola. The annual accounts are audited by an internationally recognized Namibian auditor. The Namibia Association of Norway‚Äù (NAMAS) is the main funding source, with major contributions from the Norwegian government (Norad). NAMAS had previously supported the establishment of 40 schools for the native members in Northern Kunene, during the period from 1997 to 2007. From a skeleton staff in 2008, the current HIPO administration now consists of an Executive Director, a Finance and Administration Officer and a Full Time Field Officer. In addition to this, there are 10 Field Officers who have been recruited from society members. An adviser funded by NAMAS has also been recruited. The board members are elected in the annual meeting, to join the board for a 3-year period. The current board was elected in August 2010. The board consists of members from the different tribes, and from the different geographical areas in Northern Kunene.CONSTITUTION OF HIZETJITWA (Ovahimba, Ovazemba, Ovatjimba, Ovatwa) INDIGENOUS PEOPLE ORGANISATION (HIPO) (As amended by the HIPO Annual Meeting in Etoto 21 and 22 August 2009) Motto Development, Dignity, Unity.

Biography He was born in Cieszyn into the noble Grodski family, and received his education in the Jesuit college of Vienna. In 1603 he entered the Jesuit novitiate of Brno. After making his first religious profession in 1605, he went on to the Jesuit College in K≈Çodzko (1606‚Äì1607). To be able to teach in high schools, he spent a year in the seminary in ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice. In 1608, he returned to K≈Çodzko to complete his education in music. He graduated from philosophy and theology in the Clementinum of Prague and in 1614 was ordained a priest. From 1616, he was entrusted with the management of a hostel in Prague for poor students. After the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), he was sent to Kassa, Kingdom of Hungary (today: Ko≈°ice, Slovakia) with Hungarian Istv√°n Pongr√°cz, a colleague from the Jesuit seminary. When the army of the Prince of Transylvania, George R√°k√≥czi, took Kassa, Melchior stayed at the castle, together with Istv√°n Pongr√°cz and canon Marko Krizin. On 7 September 1619, the Transylvanian army stormed the castle and arrested the priests. They gave them a death sentence on charges of treason; accusing them of inviting the Polish army into Kassa. They were tortured and then beheaded that day. The execution of the priests, known for their gentleness and courtesy, shocked the local population, Catholics and Protestants alike. The bodies of the martyrs were recovered, after negotiations with Gabriel Bethlen, and were buried in the vicinity of Kassa. In 1636, they were moved to Nagyszombat (today: Trnava, Slovakia). Veneration and Canonization The cause of beatification of the Kassa (Ko≈°ice) martyrs was opened in 1628 and they were finally beatified on 15 January 1905 by Pope Pius X.

During the 1966 Flood of the Arno River the hotel was under construction . Only the basements, the stairs and the third floor garret had been built. Probably these structures prevented the tumbling down of the nearby edifices. In 1972 part of the building was turned into a first class 4 stars hotel with the name of ‚ÄúLaurus‚Äù, to keep some memory of the ancient history of the area and in particular of the laurel grove placed between Via dell‚ÄôAlloro and Via del Giglio.

He suffered from tuberculosis, however it was treated in New York and was able to return to his pastoral duties. Responsible for the developments of many educational institutions he was significantly responsible for the development of St. Clare's Mercy Hospital. He opposed the confederation of Newfoundland and Canada as did many other Catholic clergy, and articulated his view prior to the 1948 referendums. In reaction to this, the Loyal Orange Association advised Protestants to resist Catholic influence by supporting union with Canada. The results were correlated with demographics, and a majority of districts on the Avalon peninsula with mostly Catholic voters supported responsible government instead of confederation.

In July 1943 he was transferred to the headquarters of the 3rd Division. On 19 August 1943, for medical reasons, Barber relinquished command of the 4th Brigade and returned to Melbourne, seconded to the Citizens Military Force. In September 1943 he left service with the honorary rank of brigadier. Post-war Barber lived at 60 Close St, South Yarra, Melbourne until about 1960, then moved to Terrara Rd, Mitcham, Melbourne.

As the youngest of four brothers (he had a twin sister), he studied economics at the University of Frankfurt (1955‚Äì1956), and at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich (1956‚Äì1961). His professor there was Ernst Geitlinger. Together with J√ºrgen Morschel he edited the magazine nota, which appeared in four numbers (1959‚Äì1960) and was dedicated to international art and concrete poetry. Both started the gallery nota in Munich (1960/1961),nota ‚Äì studentische Zeitschrift f√ºr bildende Kunst und Dichtung. Ed. by Gerhard von Graevenitz and J√ºrgen Morschel.

In 1961, von Graevenitz lived in Paris, where he was in contact with the Groupe de Recherche d'Art Visuel (GRAV) and shared a studio with Julio Le Parc. In 1962 he was co-founder of the international movement Nouvelle Tendance (new tendencies, Neue Tendenzen). Until the group's break-up in 1965, he was one of the four organizers of the international group-shows, operating from Munich. The first solo-exhibition of his work was organized in 1962 at Gallery Roepcke in Wiesbaden. He participated in exhibitions such as \\"the Responsive Eye\\" (1965) MOMA, New York and \\"Licht-Kunst-Licht\\" (1966) at Van Abbemuseum /Eindhoven.KunstLichtKunst. Exhib. Cat. Stedelijk van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven 1966 In 1970 he settled in Amsterdam.

From 1979 on he was a member of the board of Stichting de Appel in Amsterdam. Kinetics In 1958, after initial painterly experiments with material, he began his white monochrome reliefs (\\"White Structures\\") with concave and/or convex points or circles, showing structures as progressions, degressions and chance constellations on a grid. In 1961, he created his first kinetic object, and, from 1963 onwards, light-objects, He installed his light-wall in 1966 (which was shown in London, Eindhoven and in 1969 at the Venice Biennale ). He constructed \\"play-objects\\", some of them meant as models for multiples, and in 1962 he made serigraphs in many series, investigating non-hierarchical fields on the basis of chance-operations similar to his first kinetic objects . From 1972 onwards he used the possibilities of a chance-generator for computer-graphics, aided by the mathematician Rolf W√∂lk. For some years from 1968 his large kinetic wall hung in the foyer of the Gemeentemuseum Den Haag. In 1968 he participated in documenta 4 in Kassel with three large kinetic objects. In the 1970s he installed kinetic environments in N√ºrnberg (1969), Milan (1973) and Amsterdam (1977).Berswordt-Walrabe, Kornelia von: Gerhard von Graevenitz. Eine Kunst jenseits des Bildes. Staatl. Museum Schwerin, von der Heydt-Museum Wuppertal. Ostfildern-Ruit 1994. (3-86106-013-2) Changing structures In his work, von Graevenitz investigated and systematically visualized the phenomena of perception as determined by variable movements, light projections, space, time, chance and order. He was engaged with the optical illusion of movement ( Op art ) as well as real movement, using invisible motors and mechanics. He aimed to show a changing structure of geometrical elements with their unforeseeable movement, open for indeterminable constellations, - mostly on a contrasting ground. He intended for the eye to engage in game playing. In the late 1960s, non-hierarchical fields of the same elements gave way to fewer and larger elements, which were more complex in their movement. E.g. he created one concave elliptical element which moved completely alone on its ground. In opposition to the representatives of the first constructive movement ( Piet Mondriaan, Max Bill ) von Graevenitz did not believe in a Modernist utopian value of his art, but took it to be a special model for thoughts about how networks of relationships work in general.Gerhard von Graevenitz.

History According to temple records, the temple was founded in 668 by an ancestor of the K≈çno clan at the behest of the abdicated Empress Saimei. Ippen was born at the temple in what was then Iyo province in 1239. As a child he was known as Sh≈çjomaru. In the year 1248, his mother died, and he became a monk with the name Zuien.

Later, she attended the Lowell Whiteman School in Steamboat Springs, Colorado and trained with the Steamboat Springs Winter Sports Club, both of which, the school and the ski team, have produced many Olympic skiers. She attended college while skiing on the US Ski Team, graduating from Colorado College. United States Ski Team Outtrim earned a spot on the US Ski Team in 2005, after she tied for second in the Nor-Am Cup moguls rankings. On January 13, 2006, she competed in her first World Cup, which took place in Deer Valley, Utah, and she placed 7th. She started strong, as that was her best World Cup result that season and only top-10 out of those 8 World Cups. Her highest world ranking was 8th in moguls in 2012, but she was 9th in moguls in 2011 and 2010 as well. In the World Ski Championships in Inawashiro, Japan, on March 7‚Äì8, 2009, she placed 6th in dual moguls and 17th in moguls. But she improved upon that in the 2011 World Ski Championships in Deer Valley, Utah on February 2 and 5, 2011, placing 5th in moguls and 9th in dual moguls. She has two World Cup podiums, a 1st and a 2nd. The 2nd place finish was in Moguls in Ruka, Finland on December 10, 2011, where she scored a 22.25 (Hannah Kearney, also of the US Ski Team, won with a score of 24.70). Her World Cup victory came in moguls in Sierra Nevada, Spain on March 18, 2010; in 2nd and 3rd were Austrian Margarita Marbler and American Heather McPhie, and Outtrim was the fastest of the podium finishers and won with a score of 24.38, which was more than half a point higher than Marbler's 23.73 and McPhie's 23.71.Federation Internationale de Ski Between 2005 and 2010, she was on the Nor-Am Cup podium 14 times, with 7 victories.

During the Nazi reign he was responsible for Aryanization of Jewish property in the district of Chemnitz. In the early 1950s he was actively involved in uncovering human rights violations in the Soviet occupation zone such as arbitrary arrests, secret trials, and detention in labor camps. On 8 July 1952, he was kidnapped by the East German Ministry for State Security Stasi held in Hohensch√∂nhausen prison, then handed over to the KGB and eventually executed in the Butyrka prison in Moscow. According to a Life Magazine article dated 28 July 1952, Linse was kidnapped from outside his home on Gerichtsstra√üe American occupation zone of Berlin where at around 7.30am he was assaulted and bundled into a car. A woman who witnessed the event cried out for help and a lorry (truck) driver gave chase. The kidnappers in the car fired shots at the lorry (truck) with a pistol and dropped caltrops to deter the chase, and the car escaped into the Soviet occupation zone of Berlin with a vehicle barrier being raised to help speed the escape. (It needs to be remembered that the Berlin Wall was not constructed until 1961, so travel between the zones was still relatively unhindered at this time.) The Life article claimed to quote part of a response to the kidnapping from Neues Deutschland, a communist supported paper, translated in Life as \\"Linse....got lost. Not a single agent of war-mongering imperialism will be safe, wherever he hangs out ‚Äì be it West Berlin, Bonn, Paris or even Washington.\\" A West German police press statement, made on 13 July, identified and named four male kidnappers and 13 other accomplices who were involved in the kidnap. The police stated that all those involved were in the employ of the East German Ministry for State Security, also known as the Stasi.

He rose to the rank of admiral after service in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. Family and early life Kelly was born in Holsworthy, Devon on 3 February 1785 and baptised on 1 September 1790. He was the son of Benedictus Marwood Kelly (1752‚Äì1836) lawyer and private banker, and Mary Coham. He entered the Royal Navy on 19 October 1798 as an able seaman aboard , serving under Captain Philip Wodehouse. He moved with Wodehouse to the 28-gun and then to the 80-gun in November 1799, under the command of his uncle, Captain William Hancock Kelly. Benedictus spent the next six years aboard her, and in her assisted at the capture of Admiral Jean-Baptiste Perr√©e's squadron of three frigates and two brigs on 19 June 1799. He attended the expedition of 1800 and 1801 to Ferrol and Egypt, and was wounded in a boat attack on the French defences at Portoferraio on the island of Elba. He spent some time on the books of the 100-gun HMS Royal William, the flagship of Admiral George Montagu and the 74-gun under Captain Mark Robinson. As a captain in 1838 Kelly returned to serve under his uncle in October 1804, now in command of the 98-gun . He remained aboard Temeraire after William Kelly was superseded by Captain Eliab Harvey, and on 12 January 1805 was appointed a sub-lieutenant aboard a schooner. He was commissioned as lieutenant on 31 January 1806 and appointed to the 50-gun .Royal Naval Biography. John Marshall - 1830 Adamant was ordered to escort a convoy of East Indiamen as far as the Cape of Good Hope and on 6 May 1806 he assisted in the capture of the 30-gun Spanish frigate Reparadora. In August 1807 he moved to the 32-gun and served under a succession of commanders, Frederick Warren, William Ward, and Samuel Hood Inglefield. Under Inglefield Kelly was present with the squadron under Charles Dashwood in an attack on the town of Saman√° in San Domingo on 11 November 1808. The town was captured and the 5-gun privateers Guerri√®re and Exchange were also taken. Kelly was then given command of the boats of Daedalus and the frigate and sent to chase down and capture the officers and men of the privateers, who had escaped upriver. Kelly was successful in this endeavour, capturing them all after four days of tracking and a fierce skirmish. Promotion From Daedalus Kelly moved to become first lieutenant of the 64-gun in March 1810. Polyphemus was the flagship of Vice-Admiral Bartholomew Rowley, who died during his posting. Kelly was sent home with the despatches aboard . He captained the 18-gun sloop during the Invasion of Java between August and September 1811, and was promoted to commander on 28 November 1811. He then spent a period on half-pay without active employment, despite petitioning the Admiralty for a posting during the War of 1812 and Lord Exmouth's expedition to Algiers. Kelly was finally given a seagoing commander with an appointment to the 22-gun on 22 September 1818. He served off the coast of Africa until February 1822.

Background  The First Scutari War was waged in period 1405‚Äì1413 between Bal≈°a III and the Venetian Republic. In this war Bal≈°a III tried to capture Scutari and its surrounding region which was given to the Venetians by his father ƒêuraƒë II Bal≈°iƒá in 1396. Using the anti- Venetian rebellion of the Scutari population, Bal≈°a III managed to capture several nearby towns in 1405. The Venetians then convinced Bal≈°a's towns Budva, Bar, and Ulcinj to accept their suzerainty. After several years of battles and negotiations the war was ended in 1412 with treaty which obliged Bal≈°a III and Venice to return everything to the pre-war situation. Both parties were unsatisfied with the peace treaty and believed that the other party was in breach of the agreed terms and that the other party should pay more for the damage during the war.  War  = Between Zeta and Venice = In March 1419 Bal≈°a III again attempted to recapture Scutari and its surrounding area. In May he managed to capture Drivast and in August 1419 its castle. The Venetians tried to bribe Kastriotis and Dukagjinis to fight against Zeta in 1419, but it seems without success. The Venetians also tried to win over some other prominent members of Albanian nobility who supported Bal≈°a III, like Koja Zaharia who was asked to recognize Venetian suzerainty over his Dagnum. Then they tried to win over the Hoti and Matagu≈æi tribes. = Between the Serbian Despotate and Venice = Possession changes in Zeta  Capture of Drivast, Sveti Srƒë, and Bar  Lazareviƒá and his Serbian Despotate had been ceded Lordship of Zeta from Bal≈°a III in April 1421, but the Venetians did not recognize him, holding on to the occupied Zetan coast and Bojana, including Drivast recaptured by them after Bal≈°a's death. Venetians emphasized to the despot's envoy that they had no intention to cede Bal≈°a's former possessions to the despot and even requested Ottoman support in case of the despot's attack. In August 1421, Lazareviƒá led his army into Zeta. Gjon Kastrioti, who was a Serbian ally, reinforced Lazareviƒá with troops led by one of his sons immediately upon the arrival of the latter in Zeta.ƒÜoroviƒá 2001: \\"–£–∑ –°—Ç–µ–≤–∞–Ω–∞ —Å–µ –±–æ—Ä–∏–ª–æ –∏ –Ω–µ—à—Ç–æ –ê—Ä–±–∞–Ω–∞—Å–∞ –ò–≤–∞–Ω–∞ –ö–∞—Å—Ç—Ä–∏–æ—Ç–∞, –∫–æ—ò–∏ —ò–µ –ø—Ä–∏—à–∞–æ –¥–µ—Å–ø–æ—Ç—É –æ–¥–º–∞—Ö –ø–æ –¥–æ–ª–∞—Å–∫—É –æ–≤–æ–≥ —É –ó–µ—Ç—É.\\" According to Fan Noli it was Stanisha who was sent by his father, together with auxiliary forces, to help the Serbian despot to capture Scutari from the Venetians. With their support, the despot immediately captured Sveti Srdj and Drivast. Then he went to the coast and took Bar in the middle of November 1421. Lazareviƒá appointed Voivode Mazarek to administer his possessions in Zeta. Until then, Mazarek administered Lazareviƒá's possessions inons in Rudnik (1414) and Ostrovica. Noblemen from Bar were then invited to a meeting ithe n cathedral of St. George where they recognized the suzerainty othe f Serbian despot while Mazarek recognized their right to govern the city according to their own legislations. Serbian despotate in 1422  Truce  Lazareviƒá concluded the six-months truce with Venice and left to support king Sigismund in his fight against the Hussites. The truce was agreed to last until 15 May 1422. After Lazareviƒá's initial success, the Venetians readily accepted the truce. The towns of Scutari, Ulcinj, and Budva at that moment remainined under their control. The Venetians used the truce to reinforce the Scutari garrison. They transported soldiers, food, and arms to Skadar through river Bojana. During the truce in the first half of 1422, peace negotiations were held in Venice and attended by the despot's envoy Duke Vitko. They were continued in Serbia between Venice's envoy Marco Barbadigo and Lazareviƒá himself. When Lazareviƒá demanded the surrender of disputed towns, Venice refused and war resumed.  Battles on Bojana  Despot Stefan did not continue the war immediately after the truce because he was busy with other activities, but his voivode Mazarek undertook actions to prevent Venetian reinforcement of the Scutari garrison. He erected several fortresses on the right bank of river Bojana from where he controlled the river. When Venetian captain Niccolo Capello was sent to transport food, supplies, and archers to the besieged Scutari using three galleys, Mazarek's forces on Bojana forced his galleys to retreat to the Adriatic Sea. In July 1422, the Venetian Senate ordered Niccolo Capello to return to Bojana and complete his mission, but he decided to wait for two galleys of providur and supracomite Marco Bembo and Marco Barbo carrying soldiers and material for destruction of the fortress Mazarek had erected in Sveti Srƒë.  Siege of Scutari in 1422  Lazareviƒá's forces besieged Scutari, probably in June 1422, and for a year, it seemed that Venice would have lost their possessions. In November 1422, a Venetian fleet destroyed Mazarek's fortresses on Bojana and reached Sveti Srƒë. Due to low water level they could not continue their voyage through Bojana. Supported by some local Albanians, Venice managed to break the siege in December 1422. The Scutari garrison led by captain Niccolo Capello unexpectedly attacked Lazareviƒá's army during one December night and broke the siege. After the siege was broken Venetians reinforced Scutari's garrison with additional 400 cavalry and between 200 and 300 infantry.  Siege of Scutari in 1423  Lazareviƒá's army did not suffer serious casualties and returned under Scutari's fortress in January 1423. In January 1423, Venice bribed and won over the Pamaliots on Bojana, and then bought over several tribal leader in or near Zeta: the Pa≈°troviƒái, Gjon Kastrioti (who had extended to the outskirts of Alessio), the Dukagjins, and Koja Zaharija. Though none of these were mobilized militarily by Venice, they left the ranks of Lazareviƒá's army, thus became a potential danger to Lazareviƒá. Although Venetian admiral Francesco Bembo offered money to Gjon Kastrioti, Dukagjins, and to Koja Zaharija in April 1423 to join the Venetian forces against the Serbian Despotate, they refused. In summer of 1423, Despot Lazareviƒá sent ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá with 8,000 cavalry to Zeta. He besieged Scutari and erected fortresses on Bojana to cut off Venetian supplies of the besieged city. Duke Sandalj was prepared to support Lazareviƒá in his attempts to capture Scutari. Faced with such difficult situation Venetian governors were instructed to negotiate peace.  End of war  = Treaty of Sveti Srdj = The conflict was ended in August 1423, after conclusion of the treaty (the Peace of Sveti Srdj). In the name of the Serbian Despotate, the treaty was signed by ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá (with two witnesses who were Ottoman officials). Brankoviƒá was the despot's representative in Zeta since 1423 and was also in charge for all negotiations. According to the treaty the Serbian Despotate kept Drivast and Bar while Venice kept Scutari, Ulcinj, and Kotor. Venice was obliged to return Budva and Grbalj region to Serbia and to pay 1,000 ducats in annual tribute for Scutari to the Lazareviƒái, which they initially had paid out to Bal≈°a III. Both parties agreed to exchange prisoners and to raze their forts on Bojana which was agreed to be completely in Venetian hands. After the treaty was signed Francesco Bembo invited ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá to a ceremonial reception organized on his ship sailing through Bojana, followed by other ships of the Venetian fleet. ƒêuraƒë then asked Venice to support him with six galleys in an eventual war against the Ottomans and to confirm him all privileges previously held by his father Vuk, knez Lazar, and Despot Stefan Lazareviƒá. = Treaty of Vuƒçitrn = Although the treaty of Sveti Srƒë had been signed there were many issues that remained unresolved. Therefore, the situation was not fully resolved until the final settlement was achieved by an agreement signed in Vuƒçitrn in 1426. The treaty of Vuƒçitrn was revised in Drivast on 11 November 1426.  Aftermath  ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá succeeded Stefan Lazareviƒá after his death in 1427 and lost control over Bar to the Venetians in 1443.

Lenovo claims it is the slimmest in its class. The hinge connecting the base to the display is key to the design of the A720. The screen is anchored by a base which includes most of the unit's hardware and all of its ports. Lenovo says that this design makes ports more accessible. The A720 uses a quad-core Intel Core-i7 processor, 8 gigabytes of RAM, and a 1-terabyte hard drive. A DVD- drive comes standard and an upgrade to Blu-ray is an option. Ports include ethernet, two USB 3.0 and two USB 2.0 connections respectively, and HDMI ports for both input and output. The A720's ability to accept HDMI input allows for using the screen with external devices. An internal TV-tuner is optional. A wireless mouse and keyboard that connect via wi-fi are included. Reviews A review published in the Bangkok Post stated, \\"With all its merits, the A720 is not the perfect home computing solution. It is the most expensive on the market, has a very reflective screen, suffers the same service issues as notebooks with its compact form factor, and its touchscreen has few applications (for now). But the screen is fantastic (reflection issues apart), it's plenty powerful and it can be used as a replacement TV, which should win many punters over.\\" In a review published by ZDNet, James Kendrick wrote, \\"The 27-inch display is simply gorgeous whether working on the desktop or playing video in full-screen glory. The latter is a key function of the A720, whether using the Blu-ray drive or other video source. There is an optional TV tuner and full remote control to turn the system into an HD TV system.

The Chemnitz Tar Mummy is a mummified human body which has been on display at the museum since 2003. Work of the museum Within the scope of researching and presenting the industrial and economic history of Saxony, the association's remit includes collecting and preserving cultural artefacts, preserving Saxony's industrial heritage, and using the buildings as museums. Individual museums The individual museums of the association are: Chemnitz Museum of Industry () : Exhibits include Saxony, its industrialists, its workforce, creativity, consumers, textile manufacture, and motor car engines. West Saxon Textile Museum in Crimmitschau () : Exhibits include the buildings themselves, a complete historic textile factory owned by the Pfau brothers (producing woollens from 1885); the original looms and other machinery for preparing wool for weaving; and a detailed timeline with photographs. Ehrenfriedersdorf Tin Mine () : Exhibits include the tin mine itself, where visitors can travel down to a depth of 100 metres; a collection of over 1000 minerals; medicinal galleries; and a jewel grindery. Knappenrode Energy Factory () : Exhibits include the Lausitz Mining Museum, a century-old brick factory and powerstation; treasures of the earth; the pit's fire brigade and rescue team; fireplaces; lignite and the environment; mine surveying; diggers, locomotives and railways; pit head frames and underground clearances; and living beside the factory gates. The museums present Saxon industrial history in different ways: as a conventional museum, a textile factory, a \\"show\\" mine, and a special museum for the whole spectrum of Saxon industry, from mining via the textile industry and textile machinery manufacture, to machine tool manufacture.

Notable exhibits  = Chemnitz Tar Mummy = Chemnitz Tar Mummy The Chemnitz Tar Mummy is a mummified human body which has been on display at the Saxon Museum of Industry in Chemnitz since 2003. In 1884 a body of an unknown, 1.66 m tall workman was found in a tar container of the Chemnitz Gasworks 1. The cause of his death could not be ascertained. Because there were no signs of violence found in his body, the man was buried in the ground. After 23 years, in 1907, the body was exhumed for re-examination at the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Leipzig. A further examination revealed that the body was completely mummified. Because of tar, a gas-plant-by-product, and its preserving action on the body and the working clothes, the Chemnitz Tar Mummy is well preserved to this day. as reprinted at  References   External links  * Official Web site of the museum * Visitors * Saxony TV news * FDP Chemnitz * Saxony TV news * Bild * Freie Presse * Saxony TV news * Freie Presse * Ad Hoc News * Museum entry on European Route of Industrial Heritage Industry Industry museums in Germany Culture of Saxony Museums in Chemnitz Crimmitschau Ehrenfriedersdorf Hoyerswerda ","title":"Saxon Museum of Industry"},{"id":"36461602","text":"Argyris Chionis (; 22 April 1943 - 25 December 2011) was a Greek poet.

He started his career with Football League Third Division North club Nelson, where he made 76 league appearances in five seasons. After a short spell in non-League football with Stalybridge Celtic, Warhurst returned to professional football with Bradford City in 1932 and spent five years with the Yorkshire club. He ended his playing career with Southampton, playing his final league match in 1939. He later assisted the club in a non-playing role. In later life, he worked as a hotelier in Southampton. Biography Warhurst was born in the town of Nelson, Lancashire, on 29 December 1907. He lived in the town until his transfer away from the local club in 1931. In later life he lived in Southampton on the south coast of England, where he owned the St. Mary's Hotel. When the hotel was demolished in 1972 to build a shopping centre, Warhurst took retirement. He died in Southampton on 17 February 1981, at the age of 73. Football career =Nelson= Warhurst was signed as an amateur by Football League Third Division North club Nelson in October 1926 after playing for the local British Legion team. He spent the 1926‚Äì27 season in the reserve team as an understudy to Fred Mace, playing six matches in the Lancashire Combination. At the start of the following campaign, Warhurst was offered his first professional contract by Nelson following the departure of Mace to Macclesfield Town. He made his first senior appearance for the club on 24 September 1927 in the 2‚Äì1 win against Durham City at Seedhill, taking the place of John Stoneham who had kept goal in the first five games of the season.Dykes (2009), p. 81 Warhurst retained his starting place for the following two matches as Nelson suffered consecutive away defeats at Barrow and Wrexham, before being replaced by William Bossons for the visit of Chesterfield on 8 October 1927. He went on to make 31 league appearances during the 1927‚Äì28 campaign, keeping three clean sheets but conceding 102 goals. Nelson suffered several heavy defeats throughout the season, losing by eight goals against both Bradford City and Stockport County; their total of 136 goals conceded remains the second-highest ever in a Football League season. Bossons and Stoneham were among those released by Nelson in 1928, and Des Fawcett was brought in from Darlington to compete with Warhurst for the goalkeeper position. The new arrival started the 1928‚Äì29 season as first choice, playing the first 13 matches. Warhurst made his first appearance of the season in the 0‚Äì1 away defeat by Wigan Borough on 3 November 1928. He kept goal in three consecutive Nelson wins the following month, and missed only one match in four months. Warhurst played 19 times before Fawcett regained the goalkeeper's jersey for the last nine games of the campaign.Dykes (2009), p. 82 Warhurst was selected for the first game of the 1929‚Äì30 season, a 2‚Äì2 home draw with Southport on 31 August 1929. He was one of four goalkeepers to appear in the opening four games of the campaign, along with James Mangham and new arrivals Lewis Botto and Peter Shevlin. Neither Mangham nor Botto ever played for Nelson again, but Shevlin kept his place in the team for most of the remainder of the season, and Warhurst was restricted to only three games.Dykes (2009), p. 83 He left the club temporarily in the summer of 1930 but returned in October of the same year and made his first appearance of the new season in the 0‚Äì2 loss away at Doncaster Rovers on 11 October 1930. Over the rest of the season Warhurst played 24 times for the first team, sharing goalkeeping duties with Shevlin and Charlie Hillam, who made 18 and 3 appearances respectively. Warhurst was selected in the starting line-up for Nelson's last ever game in the Third Division North, a 0‚Äì4 defeat to Hull City on 2 May 1931.Dykes (2009), p. 84 =Later career= Following Nelson's unsuccessful re-election to the Football League in 1931, many of the playing staff left the club. Warhurst was among them, signing with Cheshire County League side Stalybridge Celtic. He spent one year with Stalybridge, helping the team to a third-placed finish, their highest for eight seasons. In June 1932, Warhurst was signed by Football League Second Division outfit Bradford City on a free transfer. He remained with the club until the end of the 1936‚Äì37 season, making a total of 66 league appearances. He remained in the Second Division after leaving Bradford, signing with Southampton in May 1937, where he replaced the recently retired Bert Scriven. Warhurst became the first-choice goalkeeper over the next two seasons, playing 81 league games for the club in total. The outbreak of the Second World War necessitated the abandonment of the 1939‚Äì40 season after three matches, signalling the end of Warhurst's professional career. However, he continued to play for Southampton in the Wartime Leagues. During the war, he also played on occasions for the Cunliffe-Owen Aircraft works team based at Eastleigh. Described as \\"on the small side\\", Warhurst was a \\"sound 'keeper with a fine reputation for sportsmanship and comradeship\\". Warhurst remained with Southampton in a non- playing capacity after the war, being appointed as a first-team trainer‚Äìcoach in March 1946. He assisted the club for several seasons before leaving following relegation from the Second Division at the end of the 1952‚Äì53 campaign.

It was produced under the banner of Bheeshm International by Mukesh Khanna, who had earlier created and done the lead role in India's first television superhero Shaktimaan in 1997. It held the record of the most expensive Indian television drama ever for a short period. Premise The series follows the story of Aryamaan (Mukesh Khanna), the warrior Prince of the human inhabited Thar Empire of the Aariyana galaxy, situated millions of light years away from Earth. Aryamaan, son of Emperor Jarant and the Emperor's second wife Queen Rasa, is the rightful heir to the throne of the Thar Empire. When Aryamaan was born, the drought-struck Aariyana experienced its first showers in many years. The distressed civilians looked up to the boy and believed that he is their saviour and will tide them over in all adverse situations. However, Aryamaan's step-mother and Emperor Jarant's first-wife queen Nasa gets extremely jealous of Rasa and Aryamaan. She also gives birth to a mutated non-human child simultaneously when Rasa gives birth to Aryamaan. A further jealous Nasa makes more than one attempt to kill the baby Aryamaan. Queen Rasa realizes that as long as Aryamaan lives with her in Thar, there is danger to his life. She instead instructs a helper robot called Tobo to take the child to planet Gurukshetra, where the 750-year-old Hoshin, a direct descendant of the great Ariyan would raise Aryamaan. Hoshin trains Aryamaan in fighting and other practices of a warrior. After learning all he has to learn from Hoshin, Aryamaan receives a special armour suit, which can be opened from its showcase only by Aryamaan's hand print. Aryamaan first visits his Thar planet and finds out that Emperor Jarant has been overthrown by Nasa, appointing her half-human, half-beast son as a dummy king while making her the Royal Mother. Aryamaan meets his parents, who have been imprisoned and chained to work in the mines of Thar. Unable to do anything at the moment, Aryamaan sets out to various planets in search of a powerful weapon called Chandrahaas, to win back his lost kingdom. Along the way, has to confront his stepmother Queen Nasa, Shukrant, Narak and other evil villains.

He also described the show as the \\"Indian version of the famous Star Wars\\". The special effects were created by Crest Communications. The cost of production is said to be about Rs. 15 lakhs- Rs. 20 lakhs per episode. The team chose RK Studios for a month and Natraj Film Studio \\"to put up massive sets, including a spaceship with detailed interiors, including fake switchboards and consoles\\". The rest of the area was converted into a storage space for the costumes and props such as swords and lightsabers. Soundtrack The title song is given by Pyarelal Ramprasad Sharma of the Laxmikant‚ÄìPyarelal. According to him, the opening theme contains a balanced fusion between Indian melody and Western music.

His life  John Higgins was the Newcastle town crier, known locally as a bellman, in the mid to late 19th century. The official job involved \\"broadcasting\\" any official messages, for which he was paid by the local council. In addition to this he would also carry out unofficial/private briefs, usually concerning lost/missing or straying persons, children or animals and lost or stolen property. For these he charged the sum of one shilling, payable in advance. His job depended upon him having a good loud voice and a good memory. He also ran an extensive business as a house-agent in his spare time. Before he got the job of town crier, his life had been varied, having sold sweets (candy), clothes pegs, toys, lambs, had been a knife and scissors sharpener, cleared snow, collected for lotteries, and anything else which came his way, and from which he could make a profit. It is known that has held the position from the late 1850s until well into the 1870s but the exact duration is uncertain. The locals used to make fun of his loud voice, but fortunately he had a good sense of humour. He cut a fine figure in his top hat, tail coat and cane, as he walked the streets and exuded an air of distinction. He was well liked and much respected by the local inhabitants.

The presumed author, Einarr Hafli√∞ason, was a student and friend of Laurentius. Although incomplete, Laurentius saga is considered to be one of the best written of the early Icelandic biographies, as well as being an important source of information about the teaching and education methods of the day.Neijmann (2007) 91-92. It can be seen as one of the products of the North Icelandic Benedictine School. The saga is preserved primarily in two vellum manuscripts containing different versions of the saga: A (Reykjav√≠k, Stofnun √Årna Magn√∫ssonar, AM 406 a I 4to), written in H√≥lar around 1530, possibly by s√≠ra T√≥mas Eir√≠ksson; and B (Reykjav√≠k, Stofnun √Årna Magn√∫ssonar, AM 180 b fol.), also written in H√≥lar, this time around 1500.

The neighborhood has been active in the Syrian civil war. History Until the 1960s, the area of Tadamon was largely covered by orchards. However, the area began to be populated by Syrians who had fled the Golan Heights after Israel occupied that region in the 1967 Six Day War. The area also saw an influx of Syrians moving in from the countryside of Damascus. Most of the people who moved to Tadamon built their homes without government permits and the area has since developed as an informal neighborhood where roughly 90% of homes lack formally registered property deeds. During the Syrian Civil War, in 2012, most of Tadamon was overrun by rebels fighting under the banner of the Free Syrian Army (FSA). In 2015, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), took over part of the district from the FSA. Government forces reasserted complete control of Tadamon in a military offensive in 2018. Population According to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics, Tadamon had a population of 86,793 in the 2004 census.Damascus city population According to Agence France-Presse, Tadamon had a pre-war population of 250,000 but most of the inhabitants fled the area during war.

This quality of the games has made them effective for developing academic literacy, noted by the use of the games for English language education in Japan. The dissemination of this pedagogy has largely been through annual national conferences held at Barnard College and regional conferences held at institutions throughout the United States.Mob Rule, Political Intrigue, Assassination: A Role-Playing Game Motivates History Students, July 9, 2012. http://chronicle.com/article/Mob-Rule-Political- Intrigue/132767/, Retrieved August 7, 2012  Attributes  Reacting games have the following attributes:Reacting to the Past Game Designer's Handbook, 3rd ed., Nick Proctor (2011) * Real historical setting * Rich texts * Multiple class meetings * Roles with well-developed characters * Victory objectives * Indeterminacy * Reading, writing, and speaking * Narrative structure with drama * Possibility of alternate historical outcomes * Accessibility to non- specialists Reacting games might also include the following common elements: * Factions * Elements of secrecy * Opening vignettes * Central texts A growing number of reacting games also make use of in-game currency or Personal Interest Points (PIPs). Game length The earliest reacting games all centered around a single, classic text and were played during half or a third of a semester. As the format of reacting games evolved, the requirement for a classic text was dropped and shorter games emerged. At present, reacting games fall into the following categories: Full games consist of 1-3 sessions of setup, 5-8 sessions of game-play, and 1-2 sessions for debriefing. Short games consist of 1 session of setup, 2-3 sessions of game-play, and one session for debriefing. Many of these games are designed to replace a single textbook chapter and typically span a week of class. Microgames consist of a single session of game-play, but usually require some setup and debriefing in the preceding and subsequent class sessions. A grant from the National Science Foundation launched a dozen new game prototypes with a shorter format.Collaborative Research: Reacting to the Past Pedagogy for Science Education (2009). National Science Foundation, Award 0920441, https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0920441 Retrieved June 21, 2012. These are useful for conference workshops or for first-time reacting game players. They are meant to introduce the game format as much as they are to teach the content. Relationship to other games and simulations =Case studies= Case studies have long been used in the medical, business, and legal education. They might involve discussion, debate, problem-based learning, or role-play.Case Types & Teaching Methods: A Classification Scheme, National Center for Case Study Teaching in Science. http://sciencecases.lib.buffalo.edu/cs/collection/method.asp Retrieved June 21, 2012. By contrast, reacting games require debate and role-play. Unlike case studies, reacting games also must be set in a true historical setting. =Live action role-playing= A live action role-playing games (LARP) has participants assuming roles and playing them out in costume. While reacting games do indeed have students playing historical roles, this rarely involves costumes. Reacting games are used for education while LARP is primarily used for recreation. In addition, while LARPs usually include a fantasy element, reacting games are historical. =Educational debating= In educational debate (or debate team), students competitively debate a topic following explicit rules. While educational debate involves only two teams (\\"for\\" and \\"against\\"), reacting games can involve multiple teams, including an undecided, indeterminate set of players. Educational debate also involves no role-playing and is not set in a historical setting. In addition, while debates focus on a single issue, reacting games feature multiple intellectual collisions, which necessitates shifting coalitions of players. Thus, those that are \\"for\\" and \\"against\\" change with each successive issue. =Model United Nations= While reacting games and Model United Nations have many similarities (e.g. educational usage, roles, factions, voting) Model UN simulations frequently focus on a fictional, rather than a historical scenario. =Historical simulation games= Historical simulation games are designed to model historical events. Both tabletop and electronic forms can be used in classes with the intent to challenge students to work through difficult scenarios and explore possible alternate historical outcomes.Simulation Games and the Study of the Past: Classroom Guidelines. http://gamingthepast.net/theory- practice/simulation-games-and-the-study-of-the-past-classroom-guidelines/ Retrieved August 7, 2012 Reacting games may contain components of historical simulation games including random events and alternate historical outcomes, however, they are more typically focused around the clash of ideas and people than the direct modeling of military or historical events. =Economics simulation games= Economic simulations are commonly used in economics courses to model the outcomes of decisions made by groups of students in competition. Reacting games may include aspects of economic simulations: for example, the acid rain and the European environment gameAcid Rain and the European Environment, 1979-89. http://reacting.barnard.edu/acid-rain-and- european-environment-1979-89 Retrieved Aug 7, 2012 incorporates pollution credit trading as a primary game mechanism. Assessment Psychological studies of students participating in reacting games have shown students to gain an \\"elevated self-esteem and empathy, a more external locus of control, and greater endorsement of the belief that human characteristics are malleable compared with controls.\\" Additional assessments are being conducted to gauge science content learning in some reacting games.Collaborative Research: Reacting to the Past Pedagogy for Science Education (2009).

Studies of reacting games played online (rather than face-to- face) show similar learning gains but lower student satisfaction. There has been little critique for the time being of reacting games. While there has been a great deal of enthusiasm for the methodology, much of that is in opposition to traditional lectures. Some students prefer a game format to traditional lecturing, but not all. The question of learning style as well as the oft-neglected teaching style should be taken into account. In the past, new methodologies have frequently been met with great enthusiasm initially, only to eventually confront realities of the classroom learning environment. The games do not lend themselves to all course material. Also, if students are exposed to too many games, it is likely there would be a \\"boredom\\" effect, perhaps as strong ‚Äì if not even stronger ‚Äì than that which may exist for some students to traditional lecture courses. In September 2019, the Chronicle of Higher Education published a profile of Reacting to the Past, discussing its popularity as well as the debate surrounding the \\"idiosyncratic\\" pedagogy.

He frequently appears on national TV and radio and has provided evidence and advice on request to the UK Government and the House of Lords. Warren specialises in technology, undercover investigations, and science issues. He is the former technology editor of Scotland on Sunday and the Sunday Express and a former associate producer for the BBC2 Sci Files series. Career In 1991, Warren reported on Kuwait and Iraq for the Guardian newspaper during Kuwait's liberation in the first Gulf War and has reported from places as diverse as Taiwan, Romania, Argentina, the Philippines and the Kalahari Desert. A frequent reporter for the Sunday Times Insight team, Warren has also worked for the Sunday Times Magazine, most notably on the magazine cover story investigation into the illegal drug culture in Moss Side in Manchester in March 1993. In 1996, Warren was runner-up in the UK Press Gazette Business Awards for Technology Scoop of the Year. A guest speaker on Technology Ethics to the European Union‚Äôs Information Society Technologies conference in 1999 in Helsinki he is now a frequent speaker at conferences and events and now organises the annual Professor Donald Michie Conference on AI with Cooley the world's largest law firm and the Institution of Engineering Technology. Warren, who lives in Suffolk, is an acknowledged expert on computer security issues and is also recognized within the technology industry for his foresight. Warren was one of the UK‚Äôs first journalists to stress the issues raised by computer viruses and the need to address the threat of computer crime in the late 80s, a topic that Warren has been a noted campaigner on since that time. His writing on the topic has won a number of prizes. Warren is now the director of two technology websites, Cyber Security Research Institute and Future Intelligence. Biography Peter Warren was born in Harlow, Essex. Warren went on to work for Computer Talk after being educated at Newport Grammar School and Northumbria University. After Computer Talk he went on to write for the Sunday Times, The Guardian, Daily Express, Scotland on Sunday, the Sunday Herald, Mail on Sunday, Daily Mirror, Evening Standard, Sunday Business, Sunday Express and other specialist magazines. He has also appeared in documentaries with Channel 4, the BBC and Sky News. Warren is a regular commentator on cybercrime issues for Sky News. Warren has won many awards in his area. In 2006, Warren won the BT IT Security News story of the year prize for his work exposing the practice of discarding computer hard drives containing sensitive business and personal data. Then in 2007, Warren won the IT Security News story of the year prize again for work done with Future Intelligence showing that Chinese hackers had broken into the UK Houses of Parliament. In 2008 Warren won the BT Enigma Award for services to technology security journalism. A campaigning journalist, Warren also wrote the first articles highlighting the potential for the emerging internet to be abused by paedophiles in 1989 and as a result was asked to brief the first UK police force to respond to the danger, the Greater Manchester Police Obscene Publications Squad, on the issues the technology has produced. In 2005, with Michael Streeter, Warren wrote the critically acclaimed book, Cyber Alert, which accurately predicted the computer security situation the world is now dealing with. Since 2009, Warren has worked on the creation of the Cyber Security Research Institute, an organisation pulling together the UK‚Äôs top academic and business experts in the field of computer security with leading journalists in a bid to raise awareness of cybercrime. From 2012, Warren has worked as the presenter on the ground breaking PassW0rd radio show on London's ResonanceFM, an hour long monthly programme on the ramifications of technology that he has developed with the veteran radio producer Jane Whyatt. In 2013, Warren once again collaborated with Michael Streeter to write Cyber crime and warfare published by Hodder and Stoughton another critically acclaimed book on cybercrime. In 2014, Warren, Streeter and Jane Whyatt produced a report for the European think tank Netopia entitled Can We Make the Digital World Ethical? which was presented to the European Union and subsequently led to an invitation from the French Senate to give a speech to it. Since 2014, Warren has made a number of highly successful films on the issues raised by technology a number of which have led to great media interest. One, the Herod Clause - which was publicly endorsed by Europol - went viral on the internet and resulted in over a million downloads of virtual private network software from the cyber security company F-Secure. Peter Warren was one of the first people to raise concerns about the issues that AI will present and in 2014 he was the lead writer of ‚ÄòCan We Make the Digital World Ethical‚Äô for the European technology think tank Netopia which was presented to the EU. As a result of the EU presentation Warren was asked to give a presentation to the French Senate on technology ethics. The speech was very well received with DeepMind collaborator Professor Murray Shanahan, Professor of Cognitive Robotics at Imperial College who also gave evidence to the French Senate calling for it to be published. DeepMind, now owned by Google is one of the world‚Äôs leading AI companies. In 2017 he was asked to organise a series of conference to discuss the ramifications of AI by Cooley, the World‚Äôs largest law firm which includes Google and Microsoft among its many clients. The conferences are held jointly between Future Intelligence, Cooley and the Institution of Engineering Technology and are now named after Professor Donald Michie, one of the fathers of AI who originated the concept with Alan Turing over games of chess while working on cracking the Enigma Code during the Second World War. Warren was subsequently asked to submit evidence to the House of Lords Select Committee on AI which re-opened its investigation into the ethics of the technology after attending Warren‚Äôs first conference in 2018. Warren has now been asked to provide advice to the House of Lords on technology ethics and is currently writing a book on the issues for Bloomsbury which is intended to lay down ethical ground rules and discuss ways of possibly regulating the technology. Warren has supplied information on cyber security on request to Graham Wright in Wright's then role as Deputy Director of the Office of Cyber Security in the Cabinet Office he is currently working on a number of books and TV projects.

Its ribbed axes are anisotomous and possess slightly expanded nodes. Lateral axes are inserted at nodes on main axes. Whorls of much divided vegetative leaves are attached at nearly right angles to nodes of basal axes, and at acute angles to nodes of terminal axes. There are six leaves per whorl. The terminal strobilus includes a central axis and verticils of fertile units. Each fertile unit consists of a bract and numerous sporangia. The margin of the elongate-cuneate bract bears a distal and many lateral elongate segments. Clusters of elongate sporangia are abaxially attached to the base of the bract at the same level. The axis has an actinostele, composed of a three-ribbed, exarch primary xylem and radial secondary xylem. Although Rotafolia songziensis closely resembles Hamatophyton verticillatum in axis character, leaf morphology and primary xylem type, they are quite different in strobilar structure. Taxonomically, Rotafolia is placed in the order Sphenophyllales by three well-defined characters: 1) whorled appendages; 2) ribbed protosteles; 3) exarch primary xylem maturation. The sphenopsids arose and began to diversify as herbaceous plants in the Devonian and reached a climax in abundance and diversity during the Carboniferous. The genus Equisetum is usually accepted as the only extant representative of this group (Stewart & Rothwell, 1993: 180), although some authors have suggested that it should be subdivided into two genera, Equisetum and Hippochaete, mainly based upon the differences in growth habit, chemical components and antheridia (Ching, 1978). Both fossil and living sphenopsids are morphologically characterized by axes with well-defined nodes bearing verticils of leaves or branches and internodes with longitudinal ribs. Fertile organs, termed strobili or cones, comprise an axis possessing whorls of bracts, or sporangiophores with adaxially attached sporangia. Anatomically preserved axes demonstrate a vascular system varying from actinostele to siphonostele. The primary xylem maturation order is either exarch or endarch/mesarch. Secondary xylem is sometimes present. In China, some Upper Devonian sphenopsids have been documented (Table 1). Among them, Xihuphyllum megalofolium (Chen, 1988), Eviostachya hoegii (Wang, 1993) and Hamatophyton verticillatum (Li, Cai & Wang, 1995) have been studied morphologically and/or anatomically in detail. Other simply described sphenopsids still need further study. In the spring of 2002, abundant and well-preserved sphenopsid fossils were collected from Songzi and Yidu districts, south-western Hubei Province. By careful comparison with the formerly described sphenopsids, in this paper we combine material from the same horizon and localities previously referred to Sphenophyllum yiduense (Feng et al., 1977), Hamatophyton verticillatum, H. yiduense, Bowmanites songziensis (Feng, 1984), Sphenophyllostachys huangkuangensis, S. songziensis, S. oblongifolius, S. sp.1 and S. sp.2.

Some specimens herein were collected from the Upper Devonian Xiejingsi Formation, Huangkuang section (a coal-mining locality on top of a mountain), Liujiachang town, Songzi district, south-western Hubei. From the same horizon and section, two specimens were loaned by courtesy of Professor Feng Shao-Nan (Institute of Geology and Mineral Resources of Yichang). Others, including most of the strobili were obtained from the same formation, in the Tizikou section (another coal-mining locality on the top of a mountain), Maohutang village, Yidu district, c. 22 km north-west of Huangkuang section.

Vegetative main and lateral axes: The anisotomous axes consist of slightly enlarged nodes and ribbed internodes (Figs 2, 5, 7‚Äì9, 13). The first-order lateral axes depart at 65¬∞ from the nodes of the assumed main axes (Figs 2, 5, 7‚Äì9), with diameter of the former axes c. half that of the latter; the second-order lateral axes at 85¬∞ from the nodes of the first-order (Fig. 2, arrow), with the diameter of the former axes c. 2/3 of the latter. The lateral axes are slightly enlarged at the point of emission. Lacking preserved base or an apex, the biggest main axis noted is up to 16.5 cm long and c. 8.0 mm in diameter (Figs 2, 5). Two first-order lateral axes occur on either side. The distance between their insertions is 5.0 cm and one lateral axis extends up to 10 cm long; the internodes of the main axis range from 2.0 to 2.5 cm long and those of the left first-order lateral axis vary from 1.5 to 1.7 cm long. Two longitudinal ribs, c. 1 mm wide, are present on the exposed surface of the axes and are continuous at the internodes and nodes (Figs 2, 5, 7‚Äì9, 20, 21). The ribs reflect the position of internal vascular strands. The axes bear distinct tiny spines (Figs 8, 9, 13, 20, 21). About eight spines are visible along the side of an axis 1 cm long. The leaves are attached at nearly right angles to the nodes of the main and lateral axes (Figs 2, 5, 7‚Äì10). Vegetative terminal axes: Measuring 0.8‚Äì1.8 mm in diameter, the terminal vegetative axes (Figs 3, 4, 6) are much more slender than the main and lateral ones. They are composed of indistinct nodes and internodes. Without clear longitudinal ribs and spines, the internodes are 1.0‚Äì3.6 cm long and 1.0‚Äì2.0 mm in diameter. In contrast with the attachment to the main and lateral axes, the leaves are inserted at c. 45¬∞ to each node of the terminal axis. Vegetative leaves: All portions of axes show nodes that bear wedge or fan-shaped leaves (Fig. 2). Because of preservation, the axes generally show two rows of leaves (Figs 2, 5, 7‚Äì10), but there are actually six leaves per whorl based on transversely fractured axes at nodes (Figs 14, 17, 18). Leaves also occur at the branching points of an axis (Figs 2, 7, 8, 16). Three leaves aligned in parallel are deeply dissected in the middle (Fig. 16) as the leaves in Figure 11; their lower parts are obscured by the overlying axis. This plant is characterized by much divided leaves (Figs 2‚Äì12, 14, 15, 17, 19). The leaf base (e.g. Figs 12, arrow, 19, arrow) and leaf segments separately refer to the parts below and above the first leaf-dividing point. In one example, only leaf bases remain (Fig. 18). The ratio of the diameter of the leaf bases to that of the attached axes is c. 0.2‚Äì1.0. The leaves equally or unequally divide. In the former case, the leaf segments are somewhat symmetrical along the mid-longitudinal line through the leaf bases (e.g. Figs 12, 14, arrow, 19). The leaves divide 2‚Äì4 times, with the first division usually occurring at the mid-point of the leaf length. As illustrated in a better-preserved specimen (Fig. 12), the initial division of a leaf produces two longer (L) and shorter (S) segments; at an angle of 25¬∞, each longer segment then equally divides twice, forming four much shorter distal segments. A few leaves show indistinct rounded tips (Fig. 15, white arrows), while most leaves taper to a sharp point (Figs 14, 19). Neither veins nor spines have been observed on leaves except for a longitudinal thin depression on the leaf base possibly representing the vein (Fig. 15, black arrow). Strobili: Some axes bear distally incomplete (Figs 22, 23) and complete terminal strobili (Fig. 32). These fertile axes below strobili are analogous to the sterile axes in that they both possess nodes and internodes, with fragmentary leaves attached at the nodes (Figs 22, arrows, 23, white arrows, 32, arrows). As in the vegetative axes, the fertile axes are anisotomous, with the lateral fertile axis (Figs 23, black arrow, 32) thinner than the main one. The strobilus of the lateral axis is much shorter and thinner than that of the main axis (Fig. 32). Strobili consist of a central axis and lateral fertile units at nodes (Figs 24, 25, 27, 30, 41). On a single strobilar axis, the nodes are sometimes represented by distinct linear depressions on the rock matrix impression surface (Figs 30, 38, 39) and the internodes are of more or less constant length. The lateral fertile units seen on longitudinally fractured axes appear superficially to be arranged in two rows (Figs 22, 23, 30, 32), but two strobili in higher magnification show another row of compressed fertile units bearing sporangia above the strobilar axis (Figs 24, white arrows, 27, white arrows, 41). A strobilar axis possesses up to 16 whorls of fertile units (Fig. 25). Because of the lack of transversely fractured strobili and failure in d√©gagement, the precise number of fertile units per node could not be determined, although it may be six as is the case for vegetative leaves. Vertically adjacent fertile units are detached from each other. Rotafolia songziensis D.-M. Wang, Hao & Q. Wang gen. et comb. nov. Line drawing of mid-lower part of the strobilus in Fig. 24, illustrating arrangement of fertile units. Side view of fertile units showing a bract with a distal segment (arrows), many lateral segments and basal sporangia. Abaxial view of sporangia along vertically central area of strobilar axis indicating their attachment at the same level (marked by dotted line). A fertile unit consists of a bract and numerous sporangia. In adaxial view, the blade of the bract is attached to a strobilar axis and elongate wedge-shaped in outline (Fig. 33). On its surface, there are many linear depressions which may represent the remains of the epidermal cells (Figs 34, 42A, arrow 4). The blade bears a distal elongate segment (Figs 33, white arrow, 42A, arrow 1). At the lateral side of the blade near the strobilar axis, there are several lateral elongate segments that recurve toward the axis (Figs 33, black arrow, 42A, arrow 2). Possibly because of preservation, the other side of the blade lacks lateral segments. In abaxial view, lateral elongate segments are distinct on one side of the elongate wedge-shaped bract blade near the strobilar axis (Figs 29, upper arrow, 37, 42B, 42C). In these examples, elongate projections suggest lateral segments on the other side of the blade, which are shown by dotted lines in Figure 42B, C. They were folded and then pressed close to the upper surface of the bract blade. In oblique abaxial view, lateral elongate segments are observed on either one side (Fig. 42D, E) or two lateral sides (Figs 35, 36, white arrows) of the bract blade. In lateral view, the distal segment of the bract is sometimes visible (Figs 24, black arrows, 28, white arrows, 41, arrows, 42F, arrow); in one example, a distal segment is up to 8.0 mm long and dichotomous (Fig. 26, arrow); lateral segments slightly reflex towards the strobilar axis (Figs 28, 35, 36, 39).

D, E, oblique abaxial view of fertile units showing a bract with lateral segments and basal pendulous sporangia. F, side view of a fertile unit from Fig. 28 illustrating a bract with distal segment (arrow), lateral segments and basal sporangia. In side view, it is clear that many pendulous sporangia are abaxially attached at the base of a bract (Figs 28, black arrow, 39, arrow, 42F). It is also the case in abaxial (Figs 29, lower arrow, 37, arrow, 42B, arrow, 42C) and oblique abaxial (Figs 35, 36, black arrow) views of a bract. In adaxial view, about 2.0 mm above the attachment point to the strobilar axis, the bract blade possesses a linear depression (Fig. 42A, arrow 3) indicating the position where the abaxial sporangia were once attached. Corresponding to this example, abaxial sporangia are pendulous at the bract 3.3 mm away from the node of the strobilar axis (Fig. 38, arrow). Sporangia are sometimes observed along the vertically central area of the strobilar axis (Figs 24, white arrows, 27, white arrows) and, as illustrated in Figure 41, they are attached at the same level although their bract is indistinct (except the fertile unit in Fig. 27, middle white arrow) or has broken off when the specimens were split. When enlarged from the corresponding area of another strobilar axis, it is obvious that the sporangia are also inserted at the same level (Fig. 31). Sporangia are elongate in shape, showing no evident morphological differences with the lateral segments of the bract. Unfortunately, we have not found any spores or dehiscence of these sporangia. = Anatomy = An anatomically preserved sterile axis collected from the Huangkuang section (Fig. 40, arrow) shows that this plant possesses an actinostele, which is rounded-triangular shaped and c. 1.7 mm in diameter (Fig. 43). The xylem consists of a central primary xylem column and a surrounding zone of secondary xylem. The extraxylary tissues have not been preserved. In some portions of the xylem, the tracheids have broken down as a result of preservation. The primary xylem is roughly triarch in outline and has three xylem ribs with three shallow concave sides between. One rib is shorter radially than the other two, and the tips of three ribs are widely spaced. The ribs vary in radial dimension from 560 to 750 ¬µm, and average 520 ¬µm in tangential dimension. In this transverse section, the primary xylem is composed entirely of polygonal tracheids. The protoxylem tracheids are 12‚Äì(20)‚àí30 ¬µm in diameter and located at the tips of the ribs (Fig. 43, arrows). The tracheids of the metaxylem are 25‚Äì(60)‚àí85 ¬µm and generally centripetally increase in diameter. They are significantly larger than those of the protoxylem and secondary xylem. The secondary xylem opposite the shorter primary rib are strongly limonitized. Rays are indistinct in the compact secondary xylem. In contrast, abundant tracheids are arranged in radial files. The tracheid files vary in tangential dimension. The tetragonal tracheids of the secondary xylem are 17‚Äì(30)‚àí45 ¬µm in diameter, usually with the smaller ones situated beside the periphery of the metaxylem strand (Fig. 44, arrows). From inner to outer regions, the secondary xylem tracheids either appear relatively constant or gradually increase or abruptly decrease in size (Figs 43, 44).  COMPARISONS  Hamatophyton verticillatum is an important member of the Upper Devonian (Famennian) plant assemblage in China. It was established by Gu & Zhi (1974: 38‚Äì39) and described as having clear axis nodes and ribbed internodes, whorls of leaves with occasional hooked tips and loose strobili. The plant was placed in the Hyeniales and regarded as a possible primitive sphenopsid. Later, other authors reported or briefly described this genus from many outcrops of China (Table 1). Based on well-preserved material from Jiangsu, Hunan and Anhui Provinces, Li et al. (1995) studied H. verticillatum in detail. They thought this plant represented a new family Hamatophytaceae included in the order Sphenophyllales. In autumn 2003, one of the authors, Wang De-Ming, observed specimens of Hamatophyton verticillatum studied by Li et al. (1995) and found that they closely resemble Rotafolia songziensis in axis character, leaf morphology and primary xylem type. Both possess spiny and ribbed axes, divided leaves. The xylem is characterized by an exarch primary xylem with three ribs. However, as is found in some sphenophyllalean plants where vegetative organs are similar in appearance, these two taxa demonstrate considerable variation in strobilar structure. As to Hamatophyton, each sporangiophore at the strobilar node bifurcates into two parts. The shorter part acts as a possible bract, the longer one results in two adaxially recurved long stalks, each of which terminates in an elliptical sporangium. Two sporangia are more or less parallel to the sporangiophore before bifurcation. In Rotafolia, however, each fertile unit of the strobilus has an elongate-cuneate bract that bears a distal segment and 10‚Äì18 lateral elongate segments. 6‚Äì10 elongate abaxial sporangia are pendulous at the base of the bract. Where they are inserted on the bract, the sporangia are at the same level. Feng et al. (1977) reported Sphenophyllum yiduense in the Xiejingsi Formation, Maohutang village, Yidu district, Hubei Province. Feng (1984) briefly described Hamatophyton verticillatum, H. yiduense in the same formation, Huangkuang section, Songzi district and Tizikou section, Yidu district. These species refer to vegetative axes with either nodes/internodes or leaves. Feng (1984) also briefly described a strobilus, Bowmanites (=Sphenophyllostachys) songziensis, in the Xiejingsi Formation, Huangkuang section, Songzi district. Subsequently, according to the specimens from the same formation and section, Feng & Ma (1991) erected five species of Sphenophyllostachys, i.e. S. huangkuangensis, S. songziensis, S. oblongifolius, S. sp.1 and S. sp.2. Generally speaking, these taxa were regarded as possessing fertile axes with nodes and internodes, whorls of bracts that are decurrent and terminally curved towards the strobilar axis or occasionally bifurcate at tips; each bract has one or two variously shaped adaxial sporangia with a short stalk. One noticeable character is the so- called ‚Äòlines of ornamentation on the surface of the sporangium‚Äô in some species. Feng & Ma also suggested that the reproductive organ of Hamatophyton Gu & Zhi, 1974 be replaced by Sphenophyllostachys. However, Li et al. (1995) thought that ‚ÄòThe descriptions (of species of Sphenophyllostachys) are too simple and fail to make a comparison with the original specimens of H. verticillatum; and according to their descriptions, the illustrations in plates and the text-figures, the features of the strobili of Sphenophyllostachys are quite different from those of the type specimens of H. verticillatum. They may represent two different taxa‚Äô. We have checked the above plant specimens described from the Xiejingsi Formation of south-western Hubei, i.e. Sphenophyllum yiduense, Hamatophyton verticillatum, H. yiduense, Bowmanites songziensis and species attributed to Sphenophyllostachys. Of these, two specimens, loaned by courtesy of Professor Feng Shan-Nan, are hereby illustrated (Figs 30, 32, 38, 39). Although their fertile features are not easy to identify, it is most likely that ‚Äòthe lines of sporangial surface ornamentation‚Äô of Bowmanites songziensis (Feng, 1984) and species of Sphenophyllostachys (Feng & Ma, 1991) actually represent individual lateral segments of the bracts. Definite attachment of sporangia therefore has not been discovered previously. All these species show great morphological similarities with the present plant in strobili as well as axes and leaves. Furthermore, these fertile and vegetative parts are now found in an organic connection. In light of these close resemblances and connection, together with the same plant-occurring horizon in Huangkuang and Tizikou section, they are most probably synonymous. By careful comparison between these previously described fossils and our new material, we have decided to make a new taxon, Rotafolia songziensis gen. et comb. nov. A few organ genera have been established to represent the detached strobili assigned to the Sphenophyllales. Most of these Carboniferous and Permian form genera are characterized by whorls of bracts that are usually fused laterally for part of their length to form a disk (Stewart & Rothwell, 1993: 193). Among them, Bowmanites or Sphenophyllostachys have variously constructed bracts adaxially attached by a variable number of sporangiophores with anatropous or orthotropous terminal sporangia (Good, 1978). Each bract of the Sphenostrobus strobilus has a single axillary sporangiophore ending in one sporangium (Levittan & Barghoorn, 1948; Good, 1978). In Peltastrobus (Leisman & Graves, 1964), the more complex strobilus consists of a whorl of three sterile and three fertile units at each node. Sterile and fertile units alternate. Each fertile unit comprises a bract and a cluster of five axillary peltate sporangiophores bearing several concentric cycles of sporangia. Two sporangiophores are distally, two are proximally directed and one is at 90¬∞ to the strobilar axis. The strobili of Rotafolia differ from those of Bowmanites, Sphenostrobus and Peltastrobus in that the bracts are independent and bear distal and lateral elongate segments; multiple abaxial sporangia are attached to the base of the bracts at the same level. Recorded in the Upper Devonian, Eviostachya hoegii (Leclercq, 1957; Wang, 1993) is a sphenopsid that has whorls of divided vegetative leaves and opposite strobilar axes at nodes. The strobilus comprises whorls of sporangiophores. The sporangiophore equally trichotomizes twice to produce nine portions, each of which terminates in three adaxially recurved ellipsoid sporangia. The actinostele is three-ribbed. Although the sporangiophore bears sterile processes, it is not associated with any leafy bracts. These fertile structures differ greatly from those of Rotafolia songziensis. Occurring from Late Carboniferous to Early Permian, Lilpopia (i.e. Tristachya) is a sphenophyllalean taxon (Taylor & Taylor, 1993: 315). Although this plant possesses sporangia below a leaf [sensu the reconstruction presented by Kerp (1984)], it differs from Rotafolia in that the fertile region is situated between the upper and lower vegetative leaves, the sporophylls lack distal or lateral divisions and the tiny ovoid sporangia are arranged in clusters. Sphenophyllum (e.g. S. emarginatumBatenburg, 1977), a common sphenopsid of Carboniferous or Permian age, bears whorls of much divided vegetative leaves as in Rotafolia songziensis. As for the vegetative internal structure of Sphenophyllum, the primary xylem is also exarch and three-ribbed. However, the axes of some species show fascicular (opposite the primary xylem ribs) and interfascicular (between the ribs) regions of secondary xylem (Reed, 1949; Boureau, 1964: 96; Cichan & Taylor, 1982; Cichan, 1985); concentric zones of secondary xylem are sometimes present (Reed, 1949). In addition, the primary xylem of the stele in Sphenophyllum is much smaller than that in Rotafolia.  DISCUSSION  Generally speaking, the Sphenopsida (Equisetopsida) include two major orders, Sphenophyllales and Equisetales. According to Stein, Wight & Beck (1984), they share five characters, i.e. whorled appendages, leaf morphology, sporangiophores, spore features and secondary tissues. Among these synapomorphies, Stein et al. considered that only the whorled appendages are unambiguously defined. However, the leaves as in Sphenophyllum and secondary xylem were regarded to be relatively unproblematic (Kenrick and Crane, 1997: 242). According to the phylogenetic analysis on these characters, Stein et al. questioned whether the Sphenophyllales are as closely related to the Equisetales as commonly believed. We think that other anatomical differences also cast doubt on the close affinity between these two orders. The former order is characterized by ribbed protosteles with exarch primary xylem, while the latter by siphonosteles with endarch or mesarch primary xylem. In the sphenophyllalean primary xylem, a limited number of protoxylem strands are located at the tips of the ribs and the lacunae are problematic, which differ from the equisetalean multiple protoxylem marked by distinct carinal canals. In some previous works, however, the discussion of the origin of the sphenopsids concerns the Sphenophyllales and Equisetales as a whole. Skog & Banks (1973) regarded the sphenopsids as derived from the primitive trimerophytes through the Ibykales (e.g. Ibyka and Arachnoxylon) and then Hyeniales (e.g. Calamophyton), which somewhat corresponds with one of the hypotheses of Stein et al. (1984). To date, the members of these two orders have been placed in the Iridopteridales and Pseudosporochnales of the Cladoxylopsida, respectively (e.g. Berry & Stein, 2000). Two species of Hyenia (i.e. H. banksii and H. vogtii) were separated by Berry & Stein (2000) from the Hyeniales and assigned to Iridopteridales and other species with the exception of H. sphenophylloides were referred to Calamophyton (Fairon-Demaret & Berry, 2000). The Sphenophyllales mainly consist of the vegetative organ genus Sphenophyllum, several fertile organ genera (e.g. Bowmanites, Sphenostrobus, Peltastrobus) and Hamatophyton. Other possible members include Eviostachya, Cheirostrobus and Lilpopia. Fertile organ genera might represent the strobili of Sphenophyllum indicated by leafy axes with uniform vegetative internal structure preserved. Although the Sphenophyllales have variously shaped constructed fertile parts, they possess the whorled appendages typical of the Sphenopsida. In the list of Stein et al. (1984), another distinctive character of the sphenophyllaleans is three- to four-ribbed primary xylem. Secondary xylem appears unnecessary in defining this order, and is absent in axes of Hamatophyton, but this taxon was still assigned to the Sphenopsida (Li et al., 1995), which represents a primitive member of this group and leads to a new family Hamatophytaceae within the Sphenophyllales. Rotafolia belongs to the Sphenopsida in verticils of vegetative leaves and fertile units at distinct nodes. It fits well with the sphenophyllalean plants in three-ribbed primary xylems of axes. Exarch primary xylem was not identified by Stein et al. (1984) as a character of the Sphenophyllales. In fact, this order of xylem maturation characterizes the actinosteles (protosteles with ribbed primary xylems) of Sphenophyllum (Cichan, 1985), Eviostachya (Leclercq, 1957; Wang, 1993), Hamatophyton (Li et al., 1995), Rotafolia (this paper) and sphenophyllalean strobilar axes (Levittan & Barghoorn, 1948; Stewart & Rothwell, 1993: 194). However, the fertile unit of the strobilus of Rotafolia has an elongate- cuneate bract with a distal segment and lateral elongate segments, as well as numerous elongate abaxial sporangia pendulous at the base of the bract, which are distinct characteristics from other members of the Sphenophyllales. Thus, considering classification at the family level, Rotafolia is now left as incertae sedis.

Syntactically and semantically Xtend has its roots in the Java programming language but focuses on a more concise syntax and some additional functionality such as type inference, extension methods, and operator overloading. Being primarily an object-oriented language, it also integrates features known from functional programming, e.g. lambda expressions. Xtend is statically typed and uses Java's type system without modifications. It is compiled to Java code and thereby seamlessly integrates with all existing Java libraries. The language Xtend and its IDE is developed as a project at Eclipse.org and participates in the annual Eclipse release train. The code is open source under the Eclipse Public License. Yet, the language can be compiled and run independently of the Eclipse platform. History Xtend originated from Xtext, which is the technology used to define the language and the editor. Xtend was first released as part of Xtext in the Eclipse release Indigo in June 2011. Since the Eclipse release Juno (June 2012, Xtend version 2.3) Xtend has become a standalone project. The language Xtend described here should not be confused with the older language with the same name in the Xpand project. Initially, Xtend was named Xtend2 for better distinction. The '2' was dropped soon for simplicity. With its template expressions, Xtend is meant as a replacement of the entire Xpand technology. Philosophy Java is one of the most popular programming languages ever with a large ecosystem of libraries and tools. Yet, its syntax is considered verbose by some, and some concepts are missing and only added slowly. Xtend tries to get the best of Java, but reduce syntactic noise and add new features to allow for shorter and better readable code. To make it easier to learn for Java developers, Xtend's syntax is close to Java's. Xtend maintains maximum compatibility with Java by compiling to Java code and using Java's type system. Java code and Xtend code can be mixed inside the same project at will. Using a combination of lambda expressions and extension methods, the language can be extended by means of libraries, i.e. without changing the language itself. A small standard library makes heavy use of this. The Eclipse-based Xtend IDE offers syntax highlighting, code completion, refactoring, navigation and debugging. It integrates with Eclipse's Java Development Toolkit. Semantics Xtend resembles Java in many regards. Here is an example Xtend file: package sample import java.util.List class Greeter { def greetThem(List names) { for(name: names) { println(name.sayHello) } } def sayHello(String name) { 'Hello ' + name + '!' } } Xtend provides type inference, i.e. the type of \`name\` and the return types of the methods can be inferred from the context. Classes and methods are \`public\` by default, fields \`private\`. Semicolons are optional. The example also shows the method \`sayHello\` called as an extension method, i.e. like a feature of its first argument. Extension methods can also be provided by other classes or instances. Instead of using the imperative for-loop, one could use a functional style lambda expression in square brackets and call the higher-order function \`forEach\` in extension syntax on the list: def greetThem(List names) { names.forEach [ println(sayHello) ] } Note that the lambda's parameter, if not specified, is called \`it\`, which can be skipped like \`this\` in Java. Its type is inferred as string. Lambda expressions are also automatically coerced to single method interfaces, such that they can be passed e.g. as a \`java.lang.Comparable\`. Template expressions are multi-line strings within triple quotes with interpolated values in French quotes. In the example above one could write def sayHello(String name) ''' Hello ¬´name¬ª ! ''' Xtend offers intelligent white-space management - the above text will not be indented in the output - thus meeting the requirements of code generation. Further language features include multimethods, a powerful switch expression, and operator overloading by means of library methods.

In addition he co-presented SBS's Is Your House Killing You and appeared in ABC's Can We Help. Dingle once had a regular spot on 6PR radio Perth advising on health issues but during the inquest on his wife's death at the hands of a homeopath, was sacked by the station, who stated that its \\"duty of care was with our listeners\\" and doubted that he would return.  Education  Peter Dingle has Bachelor of Education from the State College of Victoria, and a Bachelor of Science (Hons) and a PhD from Murdoch University.  Research  Dingle's research interests include environmental and nutritional toxicology and health. His honours thesis investigated exposure to and health effects from domestic pesticides and his PhD investigated exposure to and health effects from formaldehyde in the home in 1994. Since 1994 he has been active in research on the role of the environment, nutrition and lifestyle contributors to chronic health conditions. Dingle undertook research into the Mtech (Moletech) Fuel Saver with Murdoch University in 2008. In his report he concluded: \\"Mtech Fuel Saver reduces toxic emissions, reduces total greenhouse gas contribution and fuel consumption, possibly saving Australians hundreds of dollars worth of petrol\\". The Sydney Morning Herald reported in 2009 that the \\"Moletech Fuel Saver, has been removed from the market after an investigation in Western Australia\\" due to misleading claims made about the product.  Time at Murdoch University  * Dingle was awarded a 'Teaching Excellence Award' by Murdoch University's VC in 2003. * During his time at Murdoch he wrote books about; treating ailments without drugs, nutrition and illness, self- help/memory guidance, medical deceptions and myths, toxic exposure in homes, environmental management and education, bacterial contamination and danger in cosmetics.  Position on autism  Dingle says autism is linked to the \\"(mal)nutrition of our children\\", and has made the claim that it is \\"apparent that many cases of autism and ADHD can actually be fixed by dietary changes\\". There is no scientific basis for this view.  Death of Penelope Dingle  Dingle's first wife, Penelope, died in August 2005 from cancer following a failed attempt in 2003 to treat her using homeopathy and spirituality. Due to the delay in seeking competent medical care, the cancer spread and Penelope's weight dropped to 35 kilograms (77 lb). She eventually had a complete bowel obstruction forcing her to undergo an emergency operation of a palliative nature in October 2003, before she died in 2005. The State Coroner noted that Peter Dingle had not done enough to convince his wife to seek timely medical treatment, and that his inaction had contributed to her death. The Coroner also found that the symptoms had been present from at least as early as October 2001, while Penelope was under the care of homeopath Francine Scrayen (whom he described as \\"not a competent health professional\\") before finally consulting a doctor in December 2002. In early 2003, her cancer was diagnosed and she was presented with a treatment option which the Coroner found would have given her a \\"good chance of surviving\\". The Coroner also found that her decision to not undergo timely treatment by a competent health professional was \\"influenced by misinformation and bad science\\" and rejected Peter Dingle's extensive claims of his own memory loss around the time of Penelope's treatment.

It was the first Russian movie released in IMAX.√øRussia‚Äôs STALINGRAD To Be Released In IMAX 3D Format October 2013Ambitious Russian 3D War Drama 'Stalingrad' Begins Filming. The film was released in September 2013 in Volgograd (formerly Stalingrad) and October in Russia before its international release in subsequent months (all releases were handled by the foreign-language arm of Columbia Pictures). The film was selected as the Russian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 86th Academy Awards, but it was not nominated. Stalingrad received the I3DS (International 3D and Advanced Imaging Society) Jury Award for Russia in 2014. The film is a love story set in November 1942 during the Battle of Stalingrad, three months into the six month battle that caused nearly 2,000,000 total casualties (wounded, killed, captured) for the two opponents, including tens of thousands of Russian civilians. The story follows soldiers from both sides as they fight to survive while saving the lives of their loves, and struggle with retaining their humanity in the face of certain death and the unspeakable horrors of war. The plot seems to be somewhat influenced by Chapter 57 of Life And Fate, by Soviet writer and journalist Vasily Grossman, and therefore does have a literary antecedent. Plot The film opens in Japan in the wake of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. As emergency personnel work to reach some victims trapped underground, one rescuer tries to keep the victims calm by telling the story of how he came to have five fathers, all killed during the Great Patriotic War (World War II). The trapped victims are young German students and the rescuers are Russian. In 1942, after the initial attack on Stalingrad, a small group of Russian soldiers take cover in a large five story residential building that happens to provide cover for a Russian crossing point on the Volga river. Five of these soldiers become the five fathers in the story: Polyakov (\\"Angel\\") who had become embittered when his wife and daughter were killed in an air raid; Chvanov, whose hatred of the Germans comes from their cruel treatment and methodical murder of his family; Nikiforov, a talented tenor singer before the war, who had become a cruel and vicious fighter; Sergey, drafted into the war as a spotter; and Captain Gromov, a veteran and hero who leads the group after finding them. The soldiers encounter a young girl named Katya, living alone in the building after her family had been killed. As they spend the next few days together, the soldiers grow fond of her, and she of them. Germans encamped near the crossing are led by Hauptmann Kahn; a highly decorated, but disillusioned soldier who falls in love with a Russian woman named Masha, who resembles his late wife. She at first detests him, but soon begins to reciprocate his love, although they cannot speak each other's language. Oberstleutnant Henze arrives to take command of the Germans. He chides Kahn both for his attraction to Masha, as well as his failure to eradicate the Russian soldiers. Henze decides to set an example by rounding up the Russian civilians living in the bombed out buildings, then burning a woman and her daughter alive. This enrages the Russian soldiers who ambush the Germans, killing several, but losing several of their own men in the process. The Germans and Russians then retreat to their own shelters to wait the others out. One afternoon, Chvanov teaches Katya how to aim her gun at a German washing himself at a water faucet and startled, accidentally shoots him, which causes retaliation that injures Chvanov. During one of his visits to Masha, Kahn promises to take her to safety when the time comes. On her 19th birthday, Katya is presented with a handmade cake from the soldiers, with a song by Nikiforov, whom she had earlier recognized as a famous singer. She is then given the gift of a bathtub filled with hot water, a luxury no one has experienced since the siege began. Sergey takes Katya to his old lookout spot, located in a building not occupied by either the Germans or the Russians. The two spend the night together, unknowingly creating the narrator of our story. After Polyakov ricocheted an artillery shell into the German complex, Kahn is ordered to begin the attack on them; he takes Masha to an abandoned building, hoping to save her from the coming fight. As she begs him to stay with her, she is shot by Chvanov for being a collaborator, enraging Kahn. Nikiforov is taken captive by the Germans, where he manages to brutally stab Henze before being killed himself. Henze's death puts Kahn back in charge. German reinforcements arrive with tanks that have the range to take out the Russian soldiers and their building. They open fire, fatally injuring Chvanov. Kahn and his soldiers attack, shooting Polyakov to death. Kahn then finds Gromov on the second floor trying to use a radio. The two of them shoot each other several times before collapsing. Sergey reaches them and uses the radio to order an air strike on their building, which is being overrun by German soldiers. Katya watches with a broken heart as the building is leveled, leaving no one inside alive. Back in the present day, the Germans are freed from the building. The girl to whom Sergey (who had been named after his biological father) had told his story seeks him out, and they share a moment of understanding before he is driven away.

During that time, two key episodes of the battle were shot, in which 900 extras and historical reenactors took part in crowd scenes. The main shooting process began at the end of May 2012 and ran until 27 July 2012. Colossal scenery was constructed especially for Stalingrad filming at the former factory \\"Krasny Treugolnik\\" in St. Petersburg, and the Third North Fort near Kronstadt. Every detail for the movie sets depicting the centre of Stalingrad and the east bank of the Volga were faithfully and painstakingly reproduced, reflecting the vast scale of the battle. The budget for its construction was more than 120 million rubles (US$3.5 million), and it took over 400 people working for 6 months to build. Unusually though, for all the attention to detail the film-makers took, the Panzers reproduced for a major scene late in the film were modeled on a much different later type of the German Mk.IV that did not enter service until around a year after the battle (the Mk.IV G/H)- a major oversight by the historical advisors and production team. The film was produced in 3D using equipment provided by a Hollywood company, 3ality Technica. It was released in 3D, IMAX 3D, and 2D. > For the reason that I continue to work on this project, I read all the > history of the Battle of Stalingrad.

Kretschmann played a Leutnant in the 1993 German film, and Bondarchuk was in the 1989 Russian film, which was directed by Yuri Ozerov. Reception Reception of the film was mixed. It was praised for stunning visuals, sound editing, music, and acting, but at the same time criticized for direction and melodramatic plot.

Some critics were disappointed by the film's plot on patriotic grounds: they felt it did not pay sufficient tribute to the heroes of the Stalingrad battle, but rather concentrated too much on the love story.

The site's consensus states: \\"There's no arguing with its impressive production values, but Stalingrad should have devoted more attention to the screenplay and spent less on special effects-enhanced spectacle.\\" On another American aggregation website, Metacritic, the film has a 49/100 (citing \\"mixed or average reviews\\"), based on reviews from 23 critics. =Box office= In Russia, Stalingrad was a huge box office success earning a total of US$51,700,000, which set a new box office record for contemporary Russian films. It also set the record for opening weekend takings there, with a revenue of US$16,120,000.

He also became known as the mentor of a generation of American historians, many of whom also won prizes for their writing. Early and family life Originally from Brucetown, Frederick County, Virginia, he was born to Mae Rosa Best (1860-1929) and her husband William Edward Hesseltine (1860-1905), who had married in Maricopa County, Arizona (Phoenix) in 1901.see talk page He had no memory of his father and spent his early childhood in Brucetown with his mother and her parents.1910 U.S.Federal Census for District 37, Stonewall, Frederick County, Virginia p. 8 of 19 His maternal grandfather, Dr. William Janney Best (1834-1908), was born in Loudoun County (and may have been related to John Janney a prominent local and Virginia politician; his farmer father James Best (b. 1805) owned an enslaved man and woman in 1840 and 1860).1840 U.S. Federal Census for Jonah Hood District, Loudoun County pp. 13 and 14 of 941860 U.S. Federal Census, Slave Schedule for Southern District, Loudoun County p. 33 of 47 Dr. Best did not own slaves, nor join either side in the American Civil War, but practiced medicine slightly to the west in Clarke County,1860 U.S. Federal Census for Clarke County, Virginia, family no. 3, p. 2 of 88 including treating soldiers of both armies.Frank Friedel, \\"The Teacher and his Students, The Wisconsin Magazine of History, vol. 66, no. 2 (Winter 1982-1983): 111-114.

The Biology and Evolution of Fossil Plants . Second Edition, Academic Press 2009, , p. 333 Description This plant is similar to Hamatophyton verticillatum and is found in the Xiejingsi Formation. R. songziensis consists of branched axes, up to 20 cm long, which have slightly swollen nodes and internodes with ribs and narrow branches produced from the nodes. The axes are protostelic. Cross sections show a roughly triangular or quadrangular organization of the primary xylem and radial arrangement of the secondary xylem. Primary xylem is exarch upon maturation, with protoxylem strands positioned around the tips of the primary xylem arms. No differentiation between fascicular and interfascicular regions of the secondary xylem is apparent, and ray cells are rarely observed. Protoxylem tracheids have helical wall thickenings, whereas the tracheids of meta- and secondary xylem possess scalariform and/or bordered pits. All R. songziensis axes bear trichomes or spines, some up to 2.8 mm long. At the nodes are whorls of six leaves, up to 2.4 cm long, that regularly or irregularly fork two to four times. The leaves are positioned perpendicular to the axis in proximal portions of the plant but inserted at acute angles in distal portions. Fertile branches are produced in a terminal strobilus (8.5 cm long), which is subtended by whorls of normally developed leaves. It consists of a central axis and up to 16 whorls of fertile units, each of which consists of a bract and 6-10 sporangia. The bracts are elongate-cuneate and have prominent marginal fringes; sporangia are attached to the abaxial surface at the base of each brac. Although R. songziensis closely resembles H. verticillatum with its external axis morphology, leaf shape, and structure of the primary xylem. However, the two forms differ in strobilus morphology.

The Earl of Clarendon, in his history of the war, noted that Owen described himself as \\"a plain gentleman of Wales, who had been always taught to obey the King\\"; by contrast Cromwell referred to Owen in passing as \\"a violent man, now got into trouble enough\\". Following the Second Civil War he was sentenced to death in 1649 for treason and the murder of a Parliamentarian official, William Lloyd, but was later reprieved. At the Restoration he was made Vice-Admiral of North Wales, dying in 1666. Early life Owen was born in around 1600 in the remote district of Eifionydd in north-west Wales. He was the eldest son of John Owen of Bodsilin, Anglesey (d.1613), secretary to Francis Walsingham. His mother, Elin Maurice, was the granddaughter and heiress of the politician Sir William Maurice of Clenennau: after the elder John Owen's death she remarried, to Lord Eure. Owen's background connected him with a tradition of High Anglicanism maintained by gentry families in Wales through much of the 17th century and centred on figures like Francis Mansell, principal of Jesus College, Oxford. This \\"church loyalism\\", which emphasised the king's divine right, was to play a \\"crucial role in the fate of the Royalist cause\\". After a period of military service, Owen inherited Clenennau on his mother's death in 1626, along with the large Maurice estates in south Caernarfonshire, Merioneth, and Anglesey. He was High Sheriff of Caernarfonshire in 1630 and of Merioneth the following year. First Civil War At the outbreak of the English Civil War Owen was put on the Commission of Array for Caernarfonshire. Charles I authorised him to use county funds to raise and equip a regiment of foot in the three shires of Gwynedd, though local opposition meant that the unit was not ready until May 1643. Owen and his regiment were initially in service at Oxford, before being sent to join Prince Rupert's force besieging Bristol, where he was wounded in the face. He was later appointed Governor of Reading, and fought at the First Battle of Newbury in September. Archbishop of York John Williams, who clashed repeatedly with Owen during 1645‚Äì6 over the latter's military governorship of Conwy. By the spring of 1644 he had returned to Wales; he was reappointed Sheriff of Caernarfonshire that autumn. Following Thomas Myddleton's invasion of Wales in the winter of 1644 Owen was knighted by Charles at Oxford and was made Governor of the strategic walled town of Conwy. In February he was commissioned Sergeant Major General of foot under the Governor of Chester, John Byron, 1st Baron Byron. Owen encountered a good deal of resistance to military rule at Conwy, where the town's defences had previously been organised by Archbishop Williams of York, a Conwy native. In May 1645 Owen forcibly took possession of Conwy Castle from Williams, for which he was personally rebuked by Charles. The relationship between Williams and Owen broke down completely in 1646 after the latter requisitioned cattle and stores from Williams' relations at Gwydir Castle, and with Royalist control of Wales crumbling, in August Williams finally assisted Parliamentarian troops under Thomas Mytton to take Conwy. Owen continued to occupy the castle until surrendering on \\"honourable terms\\" on 9 November. In the immediate aftermath of the war he retired to Clenennau; he was fined heavily by Parliament but rejected an offer from Rupert to lead a Welsh brigade in French service. Second Civil War The Menai Straits at Y Dalar Hir; Owen's involvement in the 1648 revolt ended in a running battle near this spot By 1648 prospects of a peace settlement appeared in danger; Charles made an agreement with the Engager faction of the Parliament of Scotland to invade England and restore him, while elements of the Parliamentarian army were mutinous over arrears of pay. A revolt over pay led by Major-General Rowland Laugharne began in South Wales in March 1648, which became overtly political when the rebels made contact with Charles. Most Royalists chose to abide by the terms of their surrender and avoided involvement: Owen was said to have initially considered joining Laugharne, but was persuaded to attempt to spread the rebellion to Caernarfonshire. In early May Owen began recruiting disaffected former Royalist officers; his former superior Byron also arrived in Anglesey from France. Throughout the spring he managed to avoid local Parliamentarian forces under Mytton and George Twisleton, Governor of Denbigh, and by early June had gathered a force of around 300 men. On 3 June he attacked Caernarfon, taking prisoner the current High Sheriff, William Lloyd of Plas Hen, and trapping Mytton in Caernarfon Castle. Lloyd was seriously wounded and later died of \\"neglect and ill-usage\\" at the hands of Owen's men. After a brief siege Owen received news that Twisleton was marching towards Caernarfon with a relief force. Raising the siege, Owen decided to intercept Twisleton, confronting him at Y Dalar Hir on the shore of the Menai Straits on 5 June. A confused running battle developed, in which Owen initially had the upper hand but failed to break Twisleton's reserves; a Parliamentarian trooper, Captain Edward Taylor, took on Owen in single combat, pulled him from his horse, and took him prisoner, after which the remaining Royalists scattered. Owen was taken by Mytton under guard to Denbigh Castle; Owen's officers made several unsuccessful rescue attempts. He was later moved to London and held at Windsor Castle. Trial and later life Clenenney Farm, near Dolbenmaen, which incorporates a wing of Owen's former manor house. Owen was charged with treason, the violation of his 1646 articles of surrender, and the murder of Lloyd. He was tried alongside Lords Goring, Holland, Cambridge, and Capel, who had also led local rebellions in 1648. At trial in February 1649 he was condemned to death; he is supposed to have commented that \\"it was a very great honour to a poor gentleman of Wales to lose his head with such noble lords\\" and swore \\"that he was afraid they would have hanged him\\". Owen later submitted a successful petition for reprieve; the reason for its success is \\"a mystery\\", but at the time was variously attributed to the personal intervention of Cromwell, Ireton, and foreign ambassadors, as well as to the kidnapping of Griffith Jones of Castellmarch as a hostage by the Royalist captain Bartlet. A later comment by Owen suggests that the regicide James Chaloner may have been responsible for the reprieve, although there is no obvious reason for his interest in Owen's case. By July he was at liberty in London, where he entertained John Evelyn with a Welsh harpist, and was back at Clenennau by September. During the 1650s Owen remained quietly at home, although his movements were subject to restrictions; in 1652 the poet John Taylor recorded that Owen entertained him at Clenennau with a \\"liberall welcome\\". In 1659 he joined George Booth's abortive Royalist rebellion, leading to another sequestration order being placed on his estate. After the 1660 Restoration of Charles II Owen was rewarded for his previous service by being appointed to the Vice-Admiralty for North Wales, but took relatively little further part in public life: Owen had little interest in or aptitude for politics, being \\"fundamentally a soldier\\". He died in 1666 and was buried at Penmorfa Church. Family Owen married Janet, the daughter of Griffith Vaughan of Cors-y-gedol, Merioneth: they had one son, William (1624‚Äì1677), through whom Owen was the ancestor of the Owen and (later) Ormsby-Gore families of Brogyntyn, and two daughters, Anne and Katherine. Katherine, who married Robert Anwyl, later became well-known as a patron of Welsh literature. Other members of the Owen family, over several generations, were also patrons of Welsh language poets; among the National Library of Wales' manuscript holdings from the Brogyntyn collection are several poems written in praise of Sir John Owen, including poems written at the time of his appointment as Sheriff and a lengthy eulogy.

It has occupied its current site on Port Jackson's, Iron Cove at Leichhardt since 1886. Leichhardt is an all-level competitive and recreational rowing club, with a long history of supporting women's rowing. The club has enjoyed a rebirth in the new millennium partly due to the success of its Masters, Corporate Challenge and learn-to-row programs. History Park and foreshore immediately adjacent to the LRC S.G Davison, the Mayor of Leichhardt presided over a public meeting at the Leichhardt Council Chambers on 29 May 1886 which was called for the purpose of forming a rowing club. Permission was obtained from the Crown for the Leichhardt Park Trustees to permit the use of water frontage for baths and rowing club sheds through the efforts of Solomon Hyam MLA. After a boatshed was built, Sir Henry Parkes, Premier of New South Wales formally opened the new club at a ceremony on 24 September 1887 before the largest group of people ever assembled on Leichhardt Park. The club was established free from the pressure of the amateur principle in place at Sydney and Mercantile. It was for both \\"manual labourers\\" and \\"brain toilers\\" and Parkes, who described rowing as \\"a healthy, beautiful and manly exercise\\", expressed his approval of the club's democratic principle regarding membership.http://www.rowinghistory-aus.info/club- histories/sydney/03-1.php Early club histories The club took delivery of its first boat ‚Äì a single skiff ‚Äì in late 1887. Life membership subscriptions paid by some of the foundation directors were used to fund a few further skiff purchases. Leichhardt was admitted to the New South Wales Rowing Association in March 1893. A severe storm fully destroyed the club and its fleet of boats in 1897 but rebuilding and replacement was fully complete by 1900. The club's initial racing colours were buff and blue but by 1902 club equipment was being painted in red and blue, the club's livery ever since. Henry Hauenstein was the club's first selected Olympic competitor, rowing in the men's eight at Stockholm 1912. He had regularly appeared in the New South Wales state eight since 1907.http://www.rowinghistory-aus.info/interstate- championships/1907.php#M8 Guerin-Foster King's Cup History Over 100 club members left to see active service in World War I and a number fell. After the armistice Hauenstein and fellow club-member Tom McGill rowed (along with Middleton of the Sydney Rowing Club) in the victorious AIF crew at Royal Peace Regatta who won the cup for eight-oared boats presented by King George V. In time, the King's Cup, became the trophy presented to the winning men's eight at the annual Australian Rowing Championships. At the commencement of World War II the club had 40 active members. By the war's end 90 club members had served in the forces. The Australian Military Forces occupied the park, foreshore and clubhouse from 1943 and the boats were rehoused at the neighbouring Haberfield Rowing Club.http://www.rowinghistory-aus.info/club- histories/leichhardt/10.php Guerin-Foster history Leichhardt Rowing Club began co-operating with nearby ladies rowing clubs from about 1910. Women began rowing for the club in the 1950s. In 1976 the club constitution was changed to admit women as constitutional members. The 1950s was a golden era for the club. Leichhardt won the Sydney premiership four times, including a hat trick, was runner-up four other times and third in the other two years. Four club men were selected for Olympic representation at Helsinki 1952 and five for Melbourne 1956.

Screen. It was released July 17, 2012 and for now contains 20 short episodes totaling 90 minutes in length. Erin McPherson, vice president and head of video for Yahoo, claims this is a first project in what will be known as online digital blockbusters. The series stars the voices of Tom Hanks, Holland Taylor, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Antoon, Chris Parnell, Joey Kern, Paul Scheer, June Diane Raphael, and Georg Stanford Brown. Created by Tom Hanks, the series begins after the world has ended. Electric City represents peace and security in the midst of rubble. Even though it seems to be an orderly utopia, there are still secrets, back-alley dealings, daring chases and murder. The episodes are available to view for free on Yahoo.com. Episodes continue to be available to purchase through apps for iOS and Android devices. Production Animation services for Electric City were provided by 6 Point Harness in Los Angeles under the direction of Joel Trussell. =Development= Tom Hanks, Josh Feldman, and Bo Stevenson, all of whom voice characters, began writing Electric City in 2003 without intending it as necessarily a web series. Tom Hanks wrote the first story in 2003 on an Olivetti Lettera 22 typewriter. Tom Hanks said that during the development the idea was just worked and reworked at Playtone, Hanks' production company, without a production or distribution plan until Yahoo! purchased the distribution. Plot In a post-apocalyptic setting, mankind is reduced to small settlements whose main business is to produce electric power. With fossil and nuclear fuel sources mostly depleted, the communities are dependent on naturally created electricity, be it by air, water, or muscle power (the latter of which is used as a punishment for criminals and other undesirables of this society). Under the motto \\"All in service to all\\" everyone must contribute to society's welfare. Electric City is actually a collective name for several geographically separated precincts. Central cultural and social administration takes place at Central Stations. Other precincts include: *Nerima, the site of Electric City's water purification facilities and of the Camera Obscura observatory, the meeting place of the \\"knitting society\\", *Greenlight, where the city's first university is located, *Morningside, the most modern precinct and residential area, *the Mines, a mining and manufacturing district, *the Agricultural Territories, the main food provider for the city, *and the Outside, an unsettled off-limits territory lining the coast near Electric City, which is inhabited by fugitives from the persecution by the \\"knitting society\\". The precincts' main connection is by their power cables and a wired radio service, but free communication, trading, and traveling has been made illegal, since it entails the wasting of precious electrical power reserves as well as the gradual loss of influence for the \\"knitting society\\", a matriarchal group of war survivors who founded Electric City and are ruthlessly trying to maintain their power base. The Tap Coders, an underground movement of free-thinkers trying to circumvent the current social restrictions by establishing an illegal communications network, especially present a considerable thorn which they seek to eliminate. Technology There appears to be a limited use of technology in this new society, wood seems to be the primary construction material instead of metal or plastic. Also firearms appear to be absent. Some conveniences are shown, such as electric light and electric heat. There are no horses or other pack animals, but bulk transportation appears to be available by freighter boats that traverse the canals. The Skytrain appears to be a crude electric tram system that runs on an elevated suspended cable. The Walking Post delivers interpersonal communication, but it seems to be of limited use, and does not carry parcels. The Wire Service is a form of radio that is broadcast to sets that are hardwired into the main studio at Wire Central. Electricity is generated through several sources, but the city is powered down overnight to conserve energy, except for the Wire Service. Citizens are discouraged for and punished if they are found to be tapping off of the Wire Service power supply.

History  The English Chamber Choir came into existence in 1972; its earliest engagements included Haydn's Nelson Mass, Faur√©'s Requiem and Kod√°ly's Laudes Organi with Hertfordshire Chamber Orchestra, and live performances at the old Rainbow Theatre in Finsbury Park, of the rock opera Tommy with The Who. These were followed by Rick Wakeman's Journey to the Centre of the Earth with the London Symphony Orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall. Over the years the choir has performed in all the major concert halls in London (South Bank, Barbican, St John's Smith Square, Cadogan Hall), in St Paul's Cathedral, Westminster Abbey, Westminster Cathedral and many other churches known for their musical traditions. It has sung abroad in Brussels, Antwerp, Basel, Zurich, Athens and Plovdiv (Bulgaria), and has visited many cities, towns and villages throughout the UK. It has appeared at the Chelsea Festival, the Byzantine Festival in London and as part of the Encounters exhibition at the Barber Institute in Birmingham. In May 2012 it made its debut at the Brighton Festival - England's biggest arts festival. It has sung by invitation for the Lord Mayor of London at the Mansion House and HM The Queen at Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle. In 2012 it re-recorded Wakeman's Journey to the Centre of the Earth at Abbey Road Studios.  Musical associations  The choir sings regularly with the Belmont Ensemble at St Martin-in-the-Fields, in London's Trafalgar Square, performing popular classics including Mozart's Requiem, Faur√©'s Requiem, Vivaldi's Gloria and Handel's Messiah. It has also commissioned many new works, most recently the Troparion of Kassiani from the Greek-Canadian composer Christos Hatzis and Sub tuum praesidium by Ivan Moody. The choir's repertoire spans at least five centuries. Although not a specialist ‚Äòearly music' choir, it performs many a cappella works from the 16th and 17th centuries. It has in repertoire all the major choral/orchestral works of the baroque and classical era: Bach's Passions and the B Minor Mass, Handel's Dixit Dominus, Solomon and many other oratorios, the Masses of Mozart and Haydn together with Mozart's Requiem and Haydn's The Creation. On occasion it has expanded its forces to perform Brahms' Requiem and Elgar's Dream of Gerontius. Its a cappella repertoire includes a wide spectrum from Tallis to Tavener. Britten and Poulenc feature prominently, together with Richard Strauss, Schoenberg, Arnold Bax and many other Romantic composers. For many years the choir featured on albums by Vangelis, and is probably best known for being featured on his soundtrack to the Ridley Scott film 1492: Conquest of Paradise. Other credits include the Era albums created by the French composer Eric L√©vi. The choir's relationship with Rick Wakeman, begun in 1974, continues to this day. In 2009 it appeared live with Wakeman at Hampton Court in a revival of his first solo album The Six Wives of Henry VIII as part of the celebrations of the 500th anniversary of Henry's accession to the throne and a few weeks later at Cadogan Hall in his 'unplugged' piano, choir and orchestra programme: P'n'O The choir has a special association with contemporary music written for the Orthodox Church and/or inspired by Eastern traditions. It has sung and recorded many works by John Tavener, Ivan Moody and Christos Hatzis, among others. It has also collaborated on several occasions with the William Tyndale Society in programmes exploring not only the words of Tyndale himself, but the use of vernacular texts in sacred music across Europe.  Fortieth anniversary  In October 2012 the choir celebrated its 40th anniversary with a concert in St John's Smith Square. This included works by Bach, Bax, Tallis (the 40-part motet Spem in alium), Christos Hatzis and Ivan Moody. Paddy O'Connell and Rick Wakeman were guests.  Film, television and radio  Film credits include 1492: Conquest of Paradise and Band of Brothers. The choir has appeared on Gordon Ramsey's Christmas Cookalong (when his guest was Gok Wan), on Chris Moyles' Quiz Night singing hymn-tunes to Stephen Fry, and from 2008 to 2011 has written and sung satirical versions of popular Christmas Carols on Radio 4's Broadcasting House on the Sunday morning before Christmas.

Founded by Afzal Kahn, the company has its headquarters in Bradford and showrooms in both Chelsea and Kensington in London. Initially the company designed and sold alloy wheels, but in 2003 developed into car design modifications and coachbuilding. As of 2011, the company employs 80 people, including 20 designers.  Work  Kahn, who has been called \\"the king of car customisation\\" by the automotive magazine, Autocar, pulled out of architecture to pursue his love for cars. Kahn Design Jeep Wrangler Sahara In 1996, Kahn designed the RS-R alloy wheel. The design, in which the spokes gave the appearance of continuing all the way to the rim was considered a first in the industry. Using capital derived from the initial sold-out production run of 1,000 RS-R wheels, Kahn founded A. Kahn Design in Bradford, West Yorkshire in the late 1990s. Kahn continued in the role of creative director, releasing further wheel designs, and adding exterior styling and vehicle interior design to the company's product range. He also sought partnerships with other fashion brands to collaborate on the interior designs, such as Harris Tweed. By 2002, Kahn Design had diversified into production of complete vehicle upgrades, necessitating a move to new, purpose-built premises in 2004, which incorporated body shop and leatherworking facilities. Kahn bought some Land Rovers and once the cars were in his studio he re-styled and re-engineered them. In 2013, Kahn opened a showroom on the King's Road in Chelsea, London for his Chelsea Truck Company which specialised in customising Land Rover Defenders and Jeep Wranglers. This was followed by the launch of a flagship showroom on Kirkstall Road in Leeds. A second Kahn Design boutique in London was launched in October 2017 on Kensington High Street. In 2014, Kahn moved into production of special edition vehicles, beginning with the release of a series of Land Rover Defender models under the Flying Huntsman brand, including extended bodywork, upgraded engine, suspension and braking systems and luxury interior design. The first two models to be announced, the 4x4 Huntsman 105 Longnose and the 6x6 Huntsman 110 Longnose, were revealed at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show. In 2015, Kahn released official images of a new supercar, based on the Aston Martin DB9, entitled Vengeance. In development for close to six years, the body, made from aluminum, was crafted using traditional hammer-formed methods, with each vehicle built by Kahn's team of craftsmen and automotive experts. The vehicle was unveiled at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show. Following the WB12 Vengeance, the 2017 Geneva International Motor Show saw the unveiling of the Vengeance Volante, a convertible version of the WB12 model. Officially unveiled at the 2016 Geneva International Motor Show, the Chelsea Truck Company Jeep Wrangler Black Hawk Edition has been described as a customised creation that combines glamorous finishes with bold body work. In April 2017, Kahn unveiled the Project Kahn Range Rover Sport SVR Pace Car, a bespoke version of Land Rover's 542bhp V8 SUV edition. In May 2017, it was announced, The London Taxi Company (LTC) had commissioned Kahn to create a run of bespoke versions of its TX4 cab, which will go out of production this year.

The Polish forces led by Crown Field Hetman Stanis≈Çaw Koniecpolski met with troops commanded by Swedish King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden. Gustavus Adolphus was wounded in the battle, which ended inconclusively. Fighting in Prussia ended in a stalemate for that year, and would not resume until 1628.  Background  In the summer of 1626 the Swedes invaded Pomerania and the Duchy of Prussia, taking Pillau (Baltiysk, Pi≈Çawa). The fighting spread, marked by a number of Swedish successes that year against the forces of the Polish king Sigismund III Vasa. In October, the Polish forces in the region were reinforced by the army of Crown Field Hetman Stanis≈Çaw Koniecpolski, relocated from the south-eastern border of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. Koniecpolski was able to slow down the Swedes and retake some territory, notably Puck (March), and defeated the Swedes at the Battle of Hammerstein (also known as Battle of Czarne) in April. In May 1627 Swedish King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden reinforced his units, attacking the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in Pomerania. Polish forces, commanded by hetman Koniecpolski, numbered under 15,000. In the summer of 1627 Koniecpolski decided to advance to the major port of the Pomerania, Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk). Both Koniecpolski and Gustav II Adolf desired a major battle. Koniecpolski needed to reduce the Swedes' strength, as their current numerical superiority made it difficult for his army to contain them; Gustav II Adolf meanwhile heard rumors of possible reinforcements for Koniecpolski arriving, and wanted to defeat him before his numerical superiority withered.  Opposing forces  The Polish army numbered 7,800, including 2,500 hussars and reiters, 2,000 Cossack light cavalry, 3,000 infantry (including 2,000 German mercenaries), and 300 artillery personnel. The Swedes were 10,100 strong, including about 6,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry. The Swedes had also a significant advantage in artillery. Gustavus Adolphus arranged his cavalry into three groups: right wing under colonel count Thurn, middle commanded by himself, and left under field marshal Herman Wrangel.  Battle  The field of battle consisted primarily of swamp of the Mot≈Çawa (Mottlau), with two levees passing through it. The Swedes were gathered south of Tczew; Poles - north of it. Gustavus Adolphus planned to provoke the Poles to charge through the levee, and break them with artillery and infantry fire. Before the main battle, when Gustavus Adolphus was scouting the battlefield, he was ambushed by a Polish unit which chased him back to his camp. The main battle begun some time later, before the noon of 7 August, with a charge of the Swedish cavalry, which pushed the Polish forces back. Koniecpolski responded with a counterattack, and the Swedes retreated to the camp; Koniecpolski however was too cautious to attack it. For a while, both armies were at a stalemate, with neither willing to advance and engage the opponent; eventually Koniecpolski begun to pull his forces back through the levee to his own camp. The Swedes charged the withdrawing Poles, and were able to disorganize the Polish cavalry, inflicting painful casualties (about 200-300) before being stopped by Polish infantry. Komiecpolski's horse was wounded and captured by the Swedes, which led them to suspect the Polish commander died. Thus Gustav II Adolf prepared a major assault for the following day. On the morning of 8 August the Swedes begun shelling the Polish positions and their artillery advantage resulted in a steady retreat of the Polish forces from their advance positions near the village of Rokitki (Rokittken). Eventually the Polish army was back in its main camp, and under artillery fire. Gustavus Adolphus decided to scout the field again before the final assault but was spotted by the Poles. He was targeted by infantry marksmen, who managed to wound him in the neck and arm, dropping him from the horse. With their commander wounded, the Swedes decided not to press the assault despite their very advantageous position.  Aftermath  From a strategic point of view the battle ended with a Polish victory, as the Poles prevented the Swedes from achieving his aim, and stopped the Swedes from taking more aggressive actions by taking advantage of their numerical superiority. The time gained also allowed Danzig to finish the construction of fortifications, which would be ready in spring of 1628. Overall, the campaign of 1627, ending with the Battle of Oliwa, was a Polish success. The wound Gustavus Adolphus received would put him in bed until autumn, and his right arm was weakened with some fingers partially paralyzed. Until 1628 both sides would focus on consolidating their position without any major actions. In the battle Gustavus Adolphus tested a new tactic, making their cavalry more aggressive, and charging into melee combat. This proved to be a major success, significantly responsible for the Swedish victory on the first day; this was particularly notable, as it marked the first time that the Swedish cavalry was able to take on the Polish cavalry, renowned at the time as the \\"best cavalry in Europe\\" according to English historian Michael Roberts. Further, Gustavus experimented with new artillery units and introduced a reorganization of infantry which would give birth to the brigade unit.

The hotel has 60 rooms and includes a subtropical garden. During World War II, it served as the headquarters of the Royal Air Force and of a squadron of British flying boats and served as a temporary residence for British officers in transit. It is one of many European hotels named Bristol, after the extensive travels of the wealthy Frederick Hervey, 4th Earl of Bristol. History George Dewey was a guest before returning to the U.S. in 1899. Princess Salm Salm was a guest while her husband was a prisoner of war. The hotel was established in the 19th century and was named after Frederick Hervey, 4th Earl of Bristol, an extensive traveller of Europe. Prior to the opening of The Rock Hotel in 1932, it was regarded as Gibraltar's flagship hotel. In September 1899, Admiral George Dewey, who led the United States Navy at the Battle of Manila Bay, stayed briefly at the hotel before his return to the United States later that month. The New York Times reported the following on 6 September 1899: \\"Admiral Dewey spent most of the day at the Hotel Bristol where he is living ashore, receiving a constant stream of visitors. He has declined all dinner and public invitations, as he is suffering from indigestion.\\" In 1915, Princess Salm Salm, the wife of a German prince and the eldest daughter of Archduke Friedrich, Duke of Teschen (commander of the Austro-Hungarian Army), lived at the hotel as a guest of the Queen of Spain. Her husband, Prince Emmanuel Salm, had been detained while hunting big game in Africa and was held as a prisoner of war in Gibraltar upon the outbreak of World War I. Princess Salm Salm left her five children in Austria to be close to her husband. According to some accounts, Princes Salm Salm was also considered a British prisoner in Gibraltar. In 1916, the prince and princess were released as part of a prisoner exchange negotiated by the King of Spain. Kenneth Dewar reconciled with Admiral Collard at the Bristol after \\"The Royal Oak Mutiny\\". In the spring of 1928, Rear Admiral Bernard Collard stayed at the Bristol during the court martial of Captain Kenneth Dewar after the notorious incident that the contemporary press dubbed \\"The Royal Oak Mutiny\\". Following the court martial, Dewar apologized to Collard in the dining room of the Bristol In April 1920 The Prime Minister Lloyd George who had landed from the P&O; liner Naldara, accompanied by Miss Lloyd George, Lord Riddel, Sir Maurice Hankey, Mr. Davies and Miss Stephenson had lunch at the Bristol Hotel. In April 1931 Don Juan de Borbon Age 18, son of King Alfonso XIII of Spain, who was a student at the Naval School at San Fernando together with his professor Capitain de Corbeta Fernando Abarzuza, arrived in Gibraltar by Spanish torpedo boat No.16. Arriving at 8.00am. They stayed at the Bristol Hotel, where he remained until invited by the Governor to stay at Government House. In September 1935, a recruiting drive was held at the hotel with the prospects increasing for war in East Africa arising out of the Abyssinia Crisis. The Second Italo-Abyssinian War broke out several days later with the Italian invasion of Abyssinia (now known as Ethiopia).Barker, A. J., The Rape of Ethiopia 1936, p. 33Nicolle, David, The Italian Invasion of Abyssinia 1935‚Äì1936, p. 11 In October 1938, General John J. Pershing's 73-year-old cousin, Dr. Edward Hamilton Pershing, recovered at the hotel after contracting smallpox while traveling aboard the British ocean liner Strathmore. During World War II, the Bristol Hotel was the headquarters of No. 200 Group of the RAF Coastal Command. Military officers in transit also utilised the hotel during the war, including some working for the SOE. The war conditions at the hotel were markedly different from the experience of those living in Great Britain as there was no blackout and steaks were on the menu. The hotel declined after World War II; it had been met with competition from The Rock Hotel which had taken its status as Gibraltar's flagship hotel in 1932. In 1954, one visitor described their room as \\"roved to be a cheerless, bare place with an lithograph of Queen Victoria hanging on the wall and two camp beds\\". During the early 1960s, work was done on the hotel to add hot water. During the later part of the 1960s, the hotel improved the kitchen and pool by making both larger, and by working with and improving the garden club.

History  Claiming to adhere to theses close to socialism, La Libre Parole is mainly known for its denunciation of various scandals, including the Panama scandal, which owes its name to the publication of a file about it in Drumont's newspaper. With the emergence of the Dreyfus affair, La Libre Parole enjoyed considerable success, becoming the principal organ for Parisian antisemitism. In the aftermath of major Hubert-Joseph Henry's suicide it sponsored a public subscription in favour of the widow in which the donors could express a wish. (A short sample: 0.5 francs \\"by a cook who would like to put the Jews in her ovens\\"; 5 francs \\"by a vicar who ardently wish to exterminate all Jews and Freemasons\\"; 1 franc \\"by a little vicar of Poitou who would be happy to sing with joy a Requiem for the last Jew left\\".)R. Girardet, Le nationalisme fran√ßais. 1871-1914 √©d. du Seuil, Paris 1983, pp. 179-181. La Libre Parole advocated a virulent anti-capitalism due to the link perceived by Drumont and his collaborators between Jews and capitalism. Drumont left the management of the newspaper in 1898 when he made his entry in politics (elected as deputy of Algiers until 1902). Around 1908, wishing to sell La Libre Parole to L√©on Daudet, Drumont tried to merge the newspaper with L'Action fran√ßaise, but this project failed. Starting in 1910, the newspaper was published by ultraconservative Catholics and never regained the level of success it had enjoyed with the belligerent style of Drumont. Gaston M√©ryhttp://revel.unice.fr/revel/pdf.php?id=6&revue;=loxias was one of its editors in chief. In January 1919, he published a statement by the Marquis de l'Estourbeillon in favour of the teaching of Breton in school. Anti- Semitism in France declined during the 1920s, in part because the fact that so many Jews died fighting for France during World War I made it more difficult to accuse them of not being patriotic. La Libre Parole, which had once sold 300,000 copies per issue, closed in 1924.  Legacy  The legacy of Drumont's daily newspaper was claimed by several ephemeral publications that reused the title La Libre Parole for nationalist and xenophobic organizations: * La Libre parole (1er no), later La Libre parole r√©publicaine (Paris, 7 novembre 1926 - avril 1929). * La Libre Parole de Paris (later Fontainebleau) (1928-1929 [?]) represents itself in 1929 as being the continuation of Drumont's daily newspaper; = 1930‚Äì1940s : the Libre parole of Henry Coston = * La Libre parole, \\"Monthly review\\", later \\"Anti-judeo-masonic review\\" (Brunoy later Paris, 1930-1936), edited by Henry Coston. In April 1935 it absorbed the biweekly Le Porc-√©pic (The Porcupine) and then appeared as La Libre parole et le Porc-√©pic. In October 1937, it was replaced by Le Si√®cle nouveau, a monthly magazine published by the National Office of Propaganda (Vichy). This Libre parole was published in parallel with the following: * La Libre Parole, \\"Independent nationalist body\\", monthly magazine (Paris, I-III, October 1930-1932), edited by Henry Coston. It also appeared in the same year under the name La Libre parole politique et sociale. **It later became La Libre parole populaire, \\"Monthly publication continuing the work of √âdouard Drumont\\" (Paris, I-II, 1933 - November 1934). **It changed name again to Libres paroles, \\"Journal de propagande nationaliste\\" (Paris, December 1934-1935). **Yet another change to La Libre parole \\"Journal hebdomadaire\\" (Paris, September 1935 - April 1939). In 1938, Coston officially took over the volume numbers of Drumont's La Libre parole. * Algiers deputy candidate Coston renamed his newspaper to La Libre parole d'Alger (later Libre Parole nord- africaine d'Alger et du Nord de l'Afrique), \\"Anti-jewish weekly of latin action\\" and sometimes La Parole encha√Æn√©e (Alger, avril 1936 - f√©vrier 1937 and a final issue in 1939). Henry Coston invoked, to justify the cessation of publication, the seizure of publications, leaflets, archives and documents in its offices.Andr√© Halimi, La d√©lation sous l'occupation, le cherche midi, p. 70-71 *In 1940, the authorities of Nazi occupied France did not permit the newspaper to reappear.

Consisting of twelve episodes (called \\"chapters\\"), it was initially intended to be a stand- alone miniseries before the series was expanded to four seasons (\\"books\\") and fifty-two episodes (\\"chapters\\") total. Book One: Air aired from April 14 to June 23, 2012, on the Nickelodeon channel in the U.S., and is broadcast in other countries beginning in June 2012. Book One: Air follows seventeen-year- old Korra from the Southern Water Tribe, and the successor of Avatar Aang from the preceding series Avatar: The Last Airbender, as she travels to the metropolis of Republic City to learn airbending and faces an anti-bender revolutionary group, the \\"Equalists\\", led by the masked Amon. Broadcast Before the series premiered on television, it was announced that the first two episodes would be pre-released online if \\"Korra Nation\\", an online social- networking platform for the show, reached 100,000 likes and shares. The goal was reached and at midnight on March 24, the first two episodes were released on a Viacom-owned website. They remained online for the duration of the weekend. Book One: Air aired on Nickelodeon and Nickelodeon HD between April 14, 2012, and June 23, 2012. For U.S. residents, the episodes were available for free viewing on the channel's website and for purchase through digital download services. Nicktoons re-aired Book One, with a few minutes of commentary from the series's creators during commercial breaks, from July 9 to July 20, 2012, under the name Korra: Making of a Legend. This series debuted in Canada on channel YTV on June 9, 2012, and on Nickelodeon Canada in late 2012. The series also premiered on Nickelodeon UK and Ireland on July 7, 2013. Synopsis The series opens introducing Korra as the Avatar and showing that she has mastered all elemental arts except airbending. Korra runs away to Republic City so that Tenzin, Avatar Aang's youngest son, can train her therein. In the metropolis, Korra clashes with police chief Lin Beifong (the daughter of Toph Beifong of the original series) after dispensing vigilante justice to the local triads. Tarrlok, an ambitious member of the city's ruling council, enlists Korra against the \\"Equalists\\", an anti-bender revolution led by the masked Amon. As Korra explores Republic City, she befriends the brothers Mako and Bolin and joins their pro-bending team, the \\"Fire Ferrets\\". The team is sponsored by Asami Sato, daughter of a wealthy industrialist, and the four together form the new \\"Team Avatar\\". After Korra's appearance in the city, the Equalists become increasingly violent, climaxing in an attack on the pro-bending arena. When Tarrlok indiscriminately represses non-benders, Korra refuses to support him. In the resulting fight, Tarrlok overpowers Korra with bloodbending, an illegal form of waterbending, and kidnaps her, framing the Equalists. As Amon arrives at Tarrlok's hideout and removes Tarrlok's bending, Korra escapes, only to find Republic City facing an Equalist conquest. In the two-part finale, naval reinforcements led by Iroh (the grandson of Zuko of the original series), are defeated by Equalist sea mines and biplanes. Attempting to find Amon, Korra learns that Tarrlok and Amon are the sons of Yakone, a mob boss defeated 42 years ago by Avatar Aang. Amon strips Korra of her bending abilities; but Korra reveals her dormant airbending abilities in a moment of distress, and exposes Amon as a waterbender, causing all his followers to desert him. He flees with Tarrlok, who detonates their boat on the open sea. Despondent, Korra establishes spiritual contact with her predecessor Aang, who restores her bending powers, allowing her to do the same to Amon's other victims.

The writers were credited for finding a believable balance between magic and technology and for their mature and nuanced portrayal of romantic relationships and conflicts. Critics also praised the writers' willingness and ability to tackle difficult themes such as social unrest, terrorism, Tarrlok's murder‚Äìsuicide of Amon, as well as the insinuation of Korra contemplating suicide during the season finale. While Book One: Air was generally well received, some aspects of the writing were criticized by reviewers. In Kotaku, Kirk Hamilton wrote that he felt that the series failed to tackle its central conflicts in a meaningful way, commenting also on the mix of comedy and drama, the many character arcs in a shorter series than Avatar, and the neat ending. Raz Greenberg of Strange Horizons commented that Korra seemed as though she had things too easy in life in comparison to Aang, and also criticized the show's rapid pacing. Max Nicholson of IGN praised the series' writing, animation, humor, setting, and characters, and wrote that elements characterized as a deus ex machina had been foreshadowed throughout. But in his opinion, the love triangle arc between Mako, Asami, and Korra fell flat and the pro-bending arc felt superfluous, although it led up to the conflict with Amon. He also considered that Mako, although a major character, felt underwritten. Lauren Davis of io9, while approving of the character arcs and the setting, was also disappointed about the series' pacing. =Ratings= The initial airings of Book One: Air, excluding reruns and digital downloads, drew an average of 3.7 million viewers per episode.Calculated from the numbers given and referenced in the chart, considering both the two-part premiere and finale as one episode each.

The novelizations were published by Random House in 2013: *Revolution (), adapting episodes one to six, published on 8 January 2013 *Endgame (), adapting episodes seven to twelve, published on 23 July 2013 =Soundtrack= The Legend of Korra is set to music by \\"The Track Team\\", the partnership of composers Jeremy Zuckerman and Benjamin Wynn. They jointly wrote the music for Avatar: The Last Airbender, but split their roles for The Legend of Korra: Zuckerman composed the music and Wynn was responsible for the sound design. Bryan Konietzko and Mike DiMartino's concept for the score was to blend traditional Chinese music with early jazz. On that basis, Zuckerman and Wynn composed a score combining elements of Dixieland, traditional Chinese music and Western orchestration, performed mainly by a string sextet and various Chinese solo instruments. A soundtrack CD, The Legend of Korra: Original Music from Book One, was released on July 16, 2013. It features 26 instrumental tracks. Konietzko wrote that the album release required \\"an incredibly frustrating wait and battle\\" to overcome \\"a bureaucratic impasse\\". He wished for the record to be commercially successful to convince Nickelodeon to release an Avatar: The Last Airbender soundtrack, a subject of many fan petitions. The day after its release, the album was the bestselling soundtrack album and no. 5 in the pop sales rankings at the online retailer Amazon.com.

The work was originally placed in the church of San Francesco at Macerata Feltria. Usually, Barontius (which is the latinized form of Baronzio) is a surname. However, from a document of 1362, which records the painter's tomb in the church of San Giuliano in Rimini it is clear that it was a patronymic. The only documentary evidence on the artist to date is a deed dated 1343 that cites ‚ÄúIohanne Baroncio pictore‚Äù as a witness. Scenes from the Life of Christ Based on the style of the painter, who may have been a disciple of Giotto but at second hand, Baronzio must have started his career around 1320 or a little later. Work The polyptych representing the Madonna and Child Enthroned with Saints (Galleria Nazionale delle Marche, Palazzo Ducale, Urbino) is the only secure basis for reconstructing his oeuvre. His Scenes from the Life of Christ (mid 1340s, Metropolitan Museum of Art) shows that Baronzio was a competent craftsman using a delicate range of colours. He also appears to have followed established Riminese iconography. Baronzio paid much attention to detail and used chromatic effects and decorative patterns as was common in the ossified traditions of the local school in its later stages. Baronzio is one of several fourteenth-century painters from Rimini, others being Giuliano, Pietro and Giovanni. The work of the Rimini school was influenced by Giotto who had visited and worked in Rimini.

He supported the independence of Mexico from Spain in 1821. He was Governor of the territory of Santa Fe de Nuevo M√©xico (New Mexico) from September 1825 until 1827. Early career Antonio Narbona was a Criollo, or locally born person of pure Spanish ancestry, born at Mobile in Spanish Louisiana, now Alabama. He arrived in Sonora in 1789 as a cadet in the Santa Cruz Company, sponsored by the commandant Brigadier Enrique Grimarest, who was his brother in law. He was promoted to ensign of the Fronteras garrison in Sonora on 27 January 1793. Lieutenant Antonio Narbona came to New Mexico from Chihuahua province in January 1805 at the head of a troop of soldiers sent to respond to a Navajo raid. The Navajos had made attacks on the Spanish military post at Cebolletta, and on nearby settlements. They were trying to recover their grazing land at the foot of Mount Taylor, their sacred Turquoise Mountain. Narbona's force travelled north from Zuni Pueblo, passing through the Narbona Pass to attack the Canyon de Chelly. The Narbona expedition killed over 115 Navajo and took 33 women and children as slaves. A 19th-century pictograph in the Canyon de Chelly National Monument represents the force. Sonora and Sinaloa In 1809 Narbona was promoted to captain at Fronteras. He became commander of the Tucson presidio. In 1815 he handed over command of Tucson to Lt Col. Manual Ignacio Arvisu. Fearing loss of protection, many of the settlers moved away. He was later given military command of Sonora. In 1819 he signed a peace treaty with the Apaches, who were in conflict with the settlers in Presidio. In 1820 he was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and was made Adjutant Inspector of the Comandancy General. Narbona was given command of the troops at Arizpe, leading them in support of the Plan of Iguala and Mexican independence from Spain. He and Sim√≥n El√≠as Gonzalez secured Arizpe and northeastern Sonora, then marched to Guaymas on the Gulf of California to put down opposition to the independence movement. On 6 September 1821 he led the chiefs and officers of the garrison who swore independence in accordance with the basis of the Plan of Iguala. As the top political leader refused to take the same attitude, he was forced to resign and Lieutenant Colonel Narbona took over command of the army in the provinces of Sonora and Sinaloa. Days later he led his forces in the direction of Guaymas, where the population led by father Pedro Leyva had refused to accept the plan, and forced them to submit. Narbona was elected second member of the Provincial Government of Sonora and Sinaloa, and on 23 July 1822 was appointed political leader of the provinces of Sonora and Sinaloa. During his administration the two provinces were separated for the first time. In the first half of 1823, he put down an uprising of the Opata and Yaqui. In August he gave the political and military command to Colonel Urrea. Promoted to colonel in April 1825, he led the forces that helped subdue the Yaqui led by Juan Banderas. He then handed over the force to the command of General Figueroa. Governor of New Mexico Colonel Antonio Narbona was appointed g√©fe pol√≠tico (equivalent to governor) of New Mexico from September 1825 to May 1827. In 1825 the United States President James Monroe sent three representatives to Santa Fe, New Mexico, to negotiate a \\"road between nations\\" and to establish trade routes and define hunting rights. George Champlin Sibley met with Governor Narbona and established cordial relations. As governor, he issued beaver-trapping licenses to foreigners from the United States on condition that they took Mexicans with them and taught them the skills. However, in 1826 he sent a report to the national government in which he expressed concern about the number of Anglo- Americans who had moved into Taos and Santa Fe. These did not just include merchants but also tradesmen such as carpenters, smiths, cabinet makers, painters and even hat makers. He died in Arizpe on March 20, 1830, and his namesake son, who was also military and attained the rank of colonel, was killed by Apaches in Cuqui√°rachi on the threshold of his house on December 23, 1848.

It consists of fourteen episodes (\\"chapters\\"). It focuses more on spiritual concepts and themes than the preceding season, Book One: Air. Ordered in early 2011, Book Two: Spirits began airing on Nickelodeon in the U.S. on September 13, 2013. Premise In a world in which some people can telekinetically control one of the four classical elements, the Avatar is the only individual who can \\"bend\\" all four elements and is responsible for maintaining balance in the world. This season focuses on Avatar Korra coming to terms with her role as the liaison between humans and the mystical \\"Spirit World\\". Book Two takes place six months after Book One; its narrative is divided between Republic City, the primary setting of the first season, and other locations such as the Spirit World and the South Pole home of the Southern Water Tribe. Korra's uncle Unalaq, the chief of the Northern Water Tribe, seizes control of the Southern Water Tribe as part of a scheme to free Vaatu, an ancient dark spirit. The narrative follows Korra's friends' efforts to win support for the southern tribe in Republic City, and Korra's quest to foil Unalaq's plans and learn about spirits. A two- part episode entitled \\"Beginnings\\" delves into the history of the Avatar lineage; it tells the story of Wan, the young man who became the first Avatar as a result of his attempts to maintain peace and balance between the material and spirit worlds and atone for empowering the dark spirit Vaatu. New characters introduced in this season include Unalaq and his children Desna and Eska; Kya and Bumi, the siblings of Korra's mentor Tenzin; and Varrick, an eccentric and wealthy inventor and businessman from the Southern Water Tribe. Production =Development= In early 2011, during the production of Book One: Air ‚Äì initially conceived as a standalone 12-episode miniseries ‚Äì Nickelodeon decided to order fourteen additional episodes to round out a standard 26-episode season. As of June 2012, Book Twos writing had been completed and the episodes were in the process of being storyboarded and animated. Joshua Hamilton and Tim Hedrick, writers for Avatar: The Last Airbender, contributed to the scripts of Book Two, and the season's episodes were directed by Colin Heck and Ian Graham. =Cast= Lisa Edelstein (Kya) Aubrey Plaza (Eska) James Remar (Tonraq) Voice actors added to the cast for Book Two: Spirits include: * Lisa Edelstein as Kya, Tenzin's elder sister, a waterbender, and the only daughter of Aang and Katara. * John Michael Higgins as Varrick, an eccentric businessman * Adrian LaTourelle as Unalaq, Korra's paternal uncle, Tonraq's younger brother, Senna's brother-in-law, Desna and Eska's father and chief of both Water Tribes who serves as the main antagonist of Book Two along with Vaatu * Aaron Himelstein as Desna, Korra's cousin * Aubrey Plaza as Eska, Desna's fraternal twin sister and Korra's other cousin. * James Remar as Tonraq, Korra's father and de facto leader of the Southern Water Tribe.

He encounters Aang's children in the Fog of Lost Souls, where he is forced to wander for eternity while going insane, his punishment for killing the moon spirit. Isaacs reprised his role after starring in Avatar: The Last Airbender. =Animation= After Studio Mir, which worked on the series' first season, initially declined to work on Book Two: Spirits, it was set to be completely animated by Japanese animation studio Pierrot. However, Mir's animation director Yoo Jae-myung said that because of problems with this arrangement, the series's producers asked Studio Mir to help step in and animate Book 2 as well, an offer they accepted to preserve their studio's reputation. He said that Studio Mir initially chose to focus on animating the less challenging The Boondocks rather than the second season of The Legend of Korra because of the exhaustion brought about by their work on the first season. At 46:10. Pierrot eventually animated episodes 1 through 6 and episode 9, while Studio Mir was responsible for episodes 7, 8, and 10 through 14. Release =Broadcast= Book Two began broadcast on Nickelodeon in the U.S. on September 13, 2013, after a 1-year hiatus. Airing on Fridays, it initially premiered at 7:00 PM EST but then shifted in mid- October to an 8:00 PM timeslot. Episodes 11 and 12 were shown on November 15, 2013. The Book Two Finale, episodes 13 and 14, were to be broadcast on November 22, 2013 but became available online on November 16, 2013. It was followed by Book Three: Changes, which consisted of thirteen episodes. =Marketing= Completed footage from Book Two was first made public in a June 2013 promotional video, in which Korra fights spirit creatures in an Arctic setting. The premiere episode was shown in full at The Legend of Korra panel at San Diego Comic-Con on 19 July 2013, together with the release of a trailer video for Book Two. Episodes Reception The premiere episode screened in advance at Comic-Con was positively reviewed by Max Nicholson of IGN, who appreciated the setup of the overarching conflict and the humorous writing. He also stated that \\"the animation in Book Two has taken yet another step up in quality, with noticeable advances in the action sequences and color treatment\\". At TV.com, Noel Kirkpatrick commented favorably on how the episode handled the necessary quantity of exposition, and on its introduction of the theme of conflict between spiritualism and secularism. Writing for Vulture, Matt Patches highlighted the loose, handheld-style cinematography ‚Äì challenging for an animated series ‚Äì and the \\"weird, wonderful\\", wildly imagined spirits fought by Korra; \\"a Kaiju parade with beasts that mirror velociraptors\\". The A.V. Club's Emily Guendelsberger stated that they kept up the first season's plot's \\"breakneck pace\\" and appeared intent on signaling a break with the convention of avoiding death in children's entertainment, by showing a spirit dragging a sailor to his likely death in the sea. She appreciated the nuanced portrayal of Korra's and Mako's relationship and Korra's character flaws, but remarked that Unalaq was being set up as the season's antagonist a bit too obviously. Parts 1 and 2 of the medial episode, \\"Beginnings\\", were positively received by critics as well. Max Nicholson of IGN rated the episode 9.6/10 and praised \\"Beginnings\\" for its \\"stunning\\" animation, \\"top-notch\\" voice acting, character origins of Avatar Wan, the friendship and heartfelt relationship between Wan and Raava, \\"great\\" new insights in the Avatar universe, and as a \\"masterstroke in storytelling and worldbuilding.\\" At the end of his review, he opined that \\"Book 2 has never looked so good.\\". \\"The Sting\\", which premiered before \\"Beginnings\\", was equally praised by Nicholson for the improvement of the characterizations of Mako and Asami and their chemistry between each other, in addition to establishing Varrick as a \\"greedy mastermind\\" rather than as an eccentric businessman and entertainer as he had been before. For \\"The Guide\\", Nicholson praised the character growths of Tenzin and the fleshed-out characterization of Jinora. He lauded the episode \\"A New Spiritual Age\\" for a \\"great character narrative\\" for Korra and the establishment of Unalaq as a more of a corrupt, twisted, and menacing villain. He was also surprised to see the return of Iroh of Avatar: The Last Airbender; this time, to help Korra with her journey in the spirit world. Parts 1 and 2 of \\"Civil Wars\\" were equally acclaimed by Nicholson for the friendship between Bolin and Varrick, the sibling dynamic of Tenzin, Kya, and Bumi, a \\"strong, complex conflict\\" for Korra, the respective relationship of Tenzin, Kya, and Bumi, and Korra, Tonraq, and Senna as the heart of the story, and the twist behind Tonraq's banishment from the Northern Water Tribe and his imprisonment. According to him, \\"Night of a Thousand Stars\\" brought out the best of Bolin and the worst of Varrick, as well as setting up the conflict for the last three episodes of Book 2. For \\"Harmonic Convergence\\", Nicholson praised its spectacular action sequences, fleshing out more on Unalaq's intriguing evil purpose, the heroism of Bumi, and the animation.

The vWD domain allows vWF to perform its blood- clotting function by carrying factor VIII around. Structure The D8 domain (amino acids 6-102 in vWF) is a highly structured region containing 24 paired cysteine residues. Secondary structure prediction from 75 aligned vWF sequences has revealed a largely alternating sequence of alpha-helices and beta-strands in the larger vWF protein. vWD is visible as lobes in cryo-EM images of the vWF. In a \\"D\\" domain of the vWF it is associated with a few other cysteine-rich domains named C8 (), TIL () and vWE. A crystal structure for the \\"D\\" domains in vWF (D' and D3) was solved in 2018 (). The VWD domain proper and the vWE domain are composed mostly of antiparallel beta sheets. C8 folds into a few helices. TIL is mostly loops with a triad of beta sheets. VWD also contains a calcium binding site. All these domains are disulfide rich. Function The vWD domain D'/D3 of the von Willebrand factor (vWF) serves as a carrier of clotting factor VIII (FVIII). The native conformation of the D' domain of vWF is not only required for factor VIII (FVIII) binding but also for normal multimerisation and optimal secretion. The interaction between blood clotting factor VIII and VWF is necessary for normal survival of blood clotting factor VIII in blood circulation. The VWFD domain is a highly structured region, in which the first conserved Cys has been found to form a disulphide bridge with the second conserved one. The other D domains in the protein are necessary for multimerisation. This domain is found in mucins, in zonadhesin, in otogelin, and in vitellogenin. Many of these proteins are extracellular glycoproteins. It is also found in a Cypridina-luciferin 2-monooxygenase . Its actual functions in these proteins are unknown.

Ash debuted on-screen on 28 September 2011. Weston attended a late audition for the role and was later told she had secured the part. Weston was signed to the serial on an initial six-month contract which was later extended by impressed producers. Ash is characterised as a rebellious, partying \\"rock chick\\", either spending her time drunk or hungover. Weston has vented that her character is also caring and wise. During her time on the show Ash has been involved in a friendship with Will Savage (James Atherton) which developed into a \\"will they, won't they?\\" style relationship. Ash was introduced along with brother Callum (Laurie Duncan). Her background and behaviour was explored following the introduction of her mother Martha Kane (Carli Norris) and sister Lacey Kane (Georgia Bourke). To further explore the family a storyline in which Ash contracts meningitis was devised. After the character's introduction she was voted fans favourite fresher in a poll run by Digital Spy. For her portrayal of Ash, Weston was nominated for \\"Best Actress\\" at The British Soap Awards 2012 and TV Choice Awards. Ash left the show on 16 October 2013 after being killed-off in an explosion as part of the show's 18th anniversary. Character creation and casting The character was created as one of five new students who arrive to study at Hollyoaks Community College. Ash was the last new student to be cast into the series, with Holly Weston securing the part. Weston said the audition and screen test was very \\"last minute\\". After her final screen test, Weston went on holiday and was informed that she had secured the role and was required to return to Liverpool to begin filming. For the role Weston later relocated to Liverpool where the serial is filmed. Weston said she and the other new cast members were initially signed to a six-month contract, which was a \\"trial period\\". Producers later decided to keep the character on. Weston said that when she first read about the character she was \\"really excited\\". She said it was \\"great\\" to get the part as she could not ask for a better character. Weston added that she had initial reservations about securing the part as eight other actresses attended the screen test for the role with one of the actresses having previously attended several other auditions. Entertainment website Digital Spy first announced the character of Ash on 5 September 2011. The Hollyoaks press office said that the collective are \\"possibly the coolest set of students ever to land in the Chester village\\". They \\"shake things up\\" and embark on a journey through \\"life's hardest lessons\\". Their first week on the programme has been touted the \\"most fun and cringe-worthy Freshers' weeks of all time\\". Character Development =Characterisation= She was initially described as a \\"wild party girl\\" and a \\"rock chick and rebel\\". E4.com described Ash stating that when she is around, \\"things get wild\\". You will never find Ash opting for a night indoors unless there is \\"alcohol, heavy metal and ill advised flashing\\" involved. Though Ash feels guilty over her antics the next morning, she convinces herself that it is part of the university student lifestyle. Ash has a brother, Callum Kane (Laurie Duncan) who she attempts to play the \\"responsible older sister\\" for. Weston has described Ash as \\"a bit of a child\\". She explained that her character \\"gets drunk a lot\\" and is \\"always hungover! She just wants to have a good time really\\". However, she opined that Ash actually has more depth to her persona, explaining that underneath the partying she has got \\"a bit of a heart\\" and has her \\"head screwed on\\". While she is attempting to have a good time, she also studies psychology, so she is \\"sussing everyone out\\". Weston said that Ash starts to have a \\"little play with people\\" because she knows what \\"they're thinking before they do\\". However at first, viewers do not realise she studies the subject because of the way she acts. Ash embarrasses herself during her first week because she drinks to much alcohol, so she \\"regrets it\\" afterwards, Weston added that real life university freshers can identify with the way she feels. Weston later gave advice to the National Union of Students, stating that new freshers should surround themselves with friends if they are going to go out drinking. She noted that Ash does not get into \\"unsafe situations because she surrounds herself with her new-found friends\\". Weston added that Ash is \\"independent\\" and is not tied down in a relationship. She explained that her character \\"doesn‚Äôt go in\\" for romances and instead is \\"out to have a laugh and be round her friends\\". Weston said that she loves that Ash just \\"doesn't care\\". She explained that when she first got the role on the serial she \\"wondered whether I'd have to wear loads of make-up, be dolled up all the time and wear heels! But it's really nice to be a little bit different. It's fun to play a cooler, messier character\\". Weston commented that she and the character have their similarities, although she wishes she had the \\"guts\\" to carry out \\"some things that Ash does\\" and she is not as wild as her on screen persona. =Relationships and friendships= Ash immediately strikes up a friendship with Will Savage (James Atherton), however he is in a relationship with Theresa McQueen (Jorgie Porter). Theresa becomes jealous of Will's new formed friendships, Porter said that Theresa \\"notices his growing bond with Ash\\" and she soon realises \\"she is not his number one priority anymore\\" when he opts to go partying with Ash and the freshers over meeting Theresa. Weston said that she read initial viewer reactions to Ash via internet forums. She said she felt worried because Ash was criticised, as viewers thought she was going to steal Will away from Theresa. She also cringed when she watched her first scenes with Will, because she was trying to \\"put on a sexy voice\\" on. Weston has said that Ash begins to hope the pair could become more than friends but she is unsure what Will thinks on the situation. She said that the storyline becomes a \\"kind of a 'will they, won't they?' scenario\\". Weston was unsure how Will would react towards Ash's feelings although she said Will \\"seems to care\\" for Ash. Atherton also explained that the spark could be explored further. He added that the romance has been \\"underlying\\" since Ash and Will met and has been \\"continuing to brew\\" as the storyline progresses. Weston later said that there is some kind of \\"hidden romance\\" between Ash and Will. She said that the \\"balance always hits one way or the other\\" with the pairing, adding that during the storyline in which Ash helps Will organise a festival, viewers see \\"what Ash thinks about the situation\\". Although Weston had previously thought Will liked Ash more than she liked him, she said it may now \\"be going the other way\\". Ash and Annalise Appleton (Tamaryn Payne) meet through Will. Weston explained that although the pair are not best friends they \\"get on strangely well, considering they both pretend that they can‚Äôt stand each other!\\" The characters \\"wind each other up\\" and at times Annalise is \\"really horrible\\" towards Ash, but Weston felt that Ash realises Annalise does not mean it which prevents her from snapping at Annalise. Payne added that the relationships starts off \\"very rocky\\" but it progresses to a \\"love/hate ‚Äì or even more of a love/love\\" relationship. She explained that Annalise cares about Ash but she finds her to be a \\"bit intimidating, because Ash gets on well with the guys really naturally, but Annalise doesn‚Äôt. Ash has got something that Annalise hasn‚Äôt, she‚Äôs just cool, and finds everything a bit easier\\". Weston explained that the pair argue, with one occasion when the pair \\"really get to each other\\" leading to Ash calling Annalise a bitch which differs from their usual \\"snide comments\\" to each other. Payne added that during the argument the pair \\"both said everything that they thought of each other, really nasty stuff!\\" She commented that she enjoys filming scenes with the two characters due to her real life friendship with Weston. =Extension of family and Meningitis= Ash is introduced along with brother Callum. Hollyoaks executive producer Emma Smithwick said that the siblings are \\"quite reserved and they keep themselves to themselves\\" which she felt needed to be explained. She felt that to explore the reasoning behind their behaviour viewers would need to learn more about \\"where they come from and their family life\\" which would involve introducing \\"satellite\\" family members. The character's background was explored via the introduction of her family. Weston welcomed the growth of the Kane family because of their similarities, with each one having \\"dark and moody\\" traits. Weston said she would like to further explore the family saying that \\"there‚Äôs definitely a lot of hidden stuff there that we haven‚Äôt seen yet, especially with the dad, who we don‚Äôt really know much about\\". Duncan said that Callum and Ash have always got on well and he \\"loves his sister very, very much\\". He added that Ash is Callum's best friend as she has helped him through a lot \\"over the years\\". On 20 March 2012 Digital Spy reported that the serial would explore the Kane family when Ash collapses and is diagnosed with meningitis. For the storyline Weston conducted research on the subject as she was unsure how Ash would be affected while she had the illness and she wanted to portray the role with realism. Hollyoaks worked closely with Meningitis trust when developing the storyline, with the trust aiming to raise awareness of meningitis in young adults. Weston backed Meningitis UK's Trust Your Instincts campaign which aims to raise awareness of symptoms, with the actress portraying Ash as having some of the \\"classic symptoms\\" during the storyline. Weston explained that in the buildup Ash returns from a night out and everybody \\"just think she‚Äôs drunk. So she wakes up with a hangover, which is so typical of Ash, and everyone‚Äôs ignoring her while she‚Äôs going: ‚ÄòNo, I feel really ill, and I didn‚Äôt drink that much.‚Äô Then she‚Äôs on the floor and they call the ambulance. [...] it‚Äôs quite serious, because they induce a coma\\". Weston explained that Ash's illness is the bacterial meningitis which is \\"really serious - you can die within a few hours of getting it\\". Ash becomes comatose with the illness. Weston said that she found these scenes difficult to film despite her presumption that the scenes would be \\"easy\\". She explained that the scenes were difficult as she found it hard to lie straight, stay awake and be aware of what was happening around her. Ash recovers and wakes from her coma. During the storyline Ash's family are affected in different ways. Weston revealed that the serial build up to the storyline by having Ash argue with her sister, Lacey (Georgia Bourke), so that when Ash becomes ill Lacey would feel guilty. When Ash is hospitalised her mother, Martha (Carli Norris), is also affected and does not cope well, forcing Callum to take over his mother's duties. Norris explained that although Martha would \\"die for her children\\" she is like a child herself and when she is required to support her family she can not handle it. Weston expressed that during the storyline viewers would see why Ash and Callum moan about Martha, explaining that viewers discover she has an alcohol problem. On how Callum is affected, Weston said that they are close as brother and sister which is proved within the storyline. She said that they usually pretend like they do not get on and Ash speaks to Callum like he is \\"the annoying little brother\\" but \\"underneath it all, you can see how much they care about each other\\". Weston felt that it was nice to explore a new side of their relationship during the storyline. Storylines Ash arrives during Freshers Week at the HCC, where she meets Will Savage (James Atherton). They make friends and she accompanies him back to his new student accommodation. She meets his roommates Annalise Appleton (Tamaryn Payne), Rob Edwards (David Atkins), Barney Harper-McBride (Tom Scurr) and Scott Sabeka (Calvin Denba). She goes out drinking with them and Ash and Rob do dares in the SU Bar, she strips and takes her bra off in front of the crowd. The next morning Ash is upset with her behaviour, however, she carries on partying for the rest of the week with her new friends. She starts spending time with Will, which makes his girlfriend Theresa McQueen (Jorgie Porter) jealous. She also clashes with Annalise over her behaviour and rapport with Rob. Ash is forced to admit she still lives at home with her family and her brother, Callum Kane (Laurie Duncan), disapproves of her wild behaviour. Ash later goes out drinking with Annalise, where she decides she can find herself a one-night stand. She chooses Riley Costello (Rob Norbury), who has just discovered that his fianc√© Mercedes Fisher (Jennifer Metcalfe) has been having an affair with his father Carl Costello (Paul Opacic) on their wedding day. She has sex with Riley in the toilets and is horrible to him when he regrets it. Ash later moves in with her friends. Ash starts to resent Will's behaviour when he starts to hang around with his rugby teammates. Ash wakes up from a night of drinking and thinks that she is hungover. She then collapses and is taken into hospital, where her family are told that she has meningitis. Ash recovers from her illness. Will plans a musical festival and promises a famous headliner in order to secure money for his family. Ash helps Will organise the event but when the festival begins she realises he does not have a headliner and attempts to persuade him to tell the audience. Will's event is saved by his cousin Dennis Savage (Joe Tracini). Lynsey Nolan (Karen Hassan) is murdered in a similar fashion to Silas Blissett's (Jeff Rawle) victims. Silas claims Will is his accomplice and the police discover Will has documents relating to Silas on his laptop and Lynsey's ring in his possession. Will is charged with her murder but released on bail. Ash supports Will, maintaining her view that Will would not hurt anyone. She convinces Will's brother Dodger Savage (Danny Mac) to speak to Will. When several villagers begin a hate campaign against Will, Ash decides she needs to convince Silas to tell the truth. She decides to visit him at the psychiatric hospital he is incarcerated in. Ash questions Will, asking him where he was when Lynsey was murdered. She discovers Will had been carrying out tasks for Silas including stealing Lynsey's ring and meeting a girl online and gaining her trust. She learns that after Will gained the trust of a girl he met up with her and filmed her. Ash tells Will that she does not believe he killed Lynsey but she no longer wants to help him due to his actions. Ash started a relationship with conman Ally Gorman (Dan O'Connor) which ended when Callum and their mother, Martha Kane (Carli Norris), caught him in bed with their younger sister, Lacey Kane (Georgia Bourke). Ash begins a relationship with Will after his wife, Texas Longford (Bianca Hendrickse- Spendlove) is murdered on their wedding day. When he discovered Ash's patient list he saw his mother Anna Blake's (Saskia Wickham) name on there which angered him. He took her on a picnic near cliffs and when he \\"dropped\\" his phone and asked Ash to pick it up he stood up behind her, ready to push her off but changed his mind. He made her quit her placement but Ash decided to continue seeing Anna. Ash finds out that Will can in fact walk and that he killed Texas and Anna so she locks herself in the bathroom so that he does not hurt her. As she screams for help, Will kicks down the door. She runs past him in an attempt to escape but Will quickly grabs her, pins her to the floor and tries to strangle her. He is stopped however as Dodger interrupts them, and Ash quickly gets to her feet and says she hates Will. An explosion from Ste Hay (Kieron Richardson) and Doug Carter's (PJ Brennan) leaving party below then explodes into the Kanes' flat. As Will gains consciousness and runs over to Ash and tells her he is sorry and that he loves her, Ash dies in his arms, as she tells Will he is going to hell. A month after Ash's death, Will is arrested for the murders of Texas and Anna. Reception For her portrayal of Ash, Weston was nominated for \\"Best Actress\\" at the 2012 British Soap Awards. She later received a \\"Best Actress\\" nomination at the 2012 TV Choice Awards. At the 2013 National Television Awards Weston was nominated in the category of \\"Serial Drama Performance\\". In a poll run by entertainment website Digital Spy to find readers favourite fresher Ash won, receiving 40.6% of the vote. An OK! columnist described Ash and Annalise as \\"two of the most popular new ‚Äòfresher‚Äô students\\", saying that the pair have one of the serial's \\"most fascinating and combustible combinations!\\" They opined that the characters had kept them \\"glued to the screen\\" with their \\"bitchy arguments\\". Soaplife's Brockway said \\"for a psychology student, Ash is pretty slow on the uptake. Not only is her boyfriend a killer, he's tried to finish her off twice and she hasn't even noticed.\\" References External links *Ash Kane at E4.com Hollyoaks characters Television characters introduced in 2011 Fictional bartenders Female characters in television ","title":"Ash Kane"},{"id":"36463378","text":"Spring of Life () is a 2000 Czech film directed by Milan Cieslar.

History The Hovenring was first conceived of in 2008, when increased traffic between Eindhoven and Veldhoven was starting to overwhelm the capacity of the roundabout on the crossing of the roads known as Heerbaan in Veldhoven and the Meerenakkerweg (Heistraat). In order to improve the flow of traffic and improve safety, it was decided to completely separate motorized and bicycle traffic. In addition, it was decided to transform the roundabout for cars into a regular crossing of streets, to improve the flow of traffic. This left a decision to be made about what to do about the bicycle traffic. The city council of Eindhoven decided that they wanted to develop an eye-catching project, in keeping with ambitions of the Brainport top technology region (a knowledge economy-driven cooperative of the municipalities in the Eindhoven metropolitan area). The design for the Hovenring was made by the ipv Delft design agency. The name was chosen through a competition held among the population of Eindhoven and Veldhoven. Literally the name means \\"ring of the Hovens\\", referring to Eindhoven, Veldhoven and Meerhoven (the residential area where the Hovenring is). In addition, the name refers to the suspended ring of the Hovenring, as well as to the ring and needle (the central pylon) of lights that are formed by the lights that adorn the construction. With the addition of the lights, the name also refers to Eindhoven's unofficial designation of \\"city of lights\\". The construction started on 11 February 2011. The new crossing was opened on 30 December 2011. About a week later, the crossing was again closed for all traffic, because the suspension cables were found to vibrate in a manner that was considered harmful. The Hovenring was finally opened to the public on 29 June 2012. Construction =Design= The Hovenring is officially a roundabout, but in fact it is a circular cable-stayed bridge with the diameter deck suspended from a single tall central pylon by 24 cables. The entire construction is made of steel. =Vibration issues= The suspension bridge had to be closed almost immediately after delivery due to unexpected vibrations in the cables caused by the wind. An investigation of the problem was undertaken during the next several weeks by professors of civil and mechanical engineering from the Eindhoven University of Technology, the Delft University of Technology and professor Albert Zasso of the Politecnico di Milano. It was finally determined that the problem was vortices of wind forming in the lee of the cables, causing far heavier vibrations than expected during design. A solution was found by applying additional dampers on the cables. Unfortunately this caused an extra delay of a month in the opening of the bridge, since the contractor initially mounted the dampers incorrectly. Comparison Circular Pedestrian Bridge in Lujiazui, China An important predecessor to the Dutch design is the cycle overpass roundabout of Tjensvollkrysset in Stavanger, Norway. Opened in 2010, it bears remarkable resemblance to the Hovenring, sharing for instance its 72 m diameter. The construction is out of concrete rather than steel, and support is more conventional. Considering the Eindhoven ring was designed from 2008 onwards, the designs may very well have been conceived independently of each other.
