History = German rail reform = At the end of the 1990s, the operational business of Deutsche Bahn was reorganised into five legally independent joint-stock companies. This measure formed part of the second stage of the German rail reform. Within the scope of the reform, a precursor company was initially established in 1997 to facilitate a transformation of the rail freight transport division structured under public law into a private enterprise company before the company DB Cargo AG was ultimately founded on 1 January 1999. The headquarters of DB Cargo AG were established in Mainz. = European expansion = At first, DB Cargo solely focused on activities in Germany. The Deutsche Bahn Group planned to invest billions in its subsidiary in order to improve its position in the transport and logistics market. When the competitive environment with other European providers became increasingly tough, Deutsche Bahn (DB) and the Dutch state-owned rail company Nederlanse Spoorwegen (NS) announced plans to merge their rail freight transport activities in 1998. Together, DB Cargo and NS Cargo reached revenues of around 6.9 billion Deutsche Mark (3.5 billion euros) and had 50,000 employees. Their amalgamation was the first ever cross-border rail merger, in which Deutsche Bahn retained its majority share of 94%. A financial holding company was created for this new company and began operations under the name Railion in the year 2000. = Internationalisation = Railion laid the foundation for the establishment of a leading European transport and logistics company that was open to further partners right from the start. While the European Commission and European Parliament aimed to promote competition among providers, the providers themselves instead opted to foster cooperation. In 2001, the Danish state-owned rail company Danske Statsbaner (DSB) merged its rail freight transport activities into the joint venture as its third partner and received shares totalling 2% in Railion in return, thus causing the stake of Deutsche Bahn to decrease to 92%. The cooperation between DB, NS and DSB played an essential role in Deutsche Bahn's long-term strategy for expansion in other European countries. This strategy covered not only state-owned rail companies but also the acquisition of private rivals, for example in Italy (2004), Switzerland (2007) and Poland (2009). These were joined by a multitude of smaller acquisitions such as the transport and logistics divisions of RAG AG. In Sweden, where Deutsche Bahn was unable to acquire its chosen target, the company instead focused on collaborations. At the end of the 2000s, Railion was therefore able to not only offer connections from north to south but also reliably serve rail lines running from west to east. Despite this progress, the tough competition had a negative impact on the company's economic development. Deutsche Bahn responded to this by introducing strict cost-saving measures, which significantly improved the situation at Railion. In 2010, the rail freight transport crisis was initially deemed to have been largely resolved. = Linking rail and road = In 2003, Deutsche Bahn transferred its share in Railion to the (which later became DB Mobility Logistics). After the successful acquisition of the then-listed logistics company Stinnes, including its freight forwarding subsidiary Schenker AG, a restructuring of responsibilities took place within Deutsche Bahn. DB Cargo, NS Cargo and other Railion companies subsequently solely focused on freight forwarding while Stinnes and Schenker took on central tasks in the fields of rail freight transport and sales. By consolidating all of its transport and logistics activities, Deutsche Bahn also aimed to achieve growth in the freight transport domain. The company adjusted its image to reflect this aim and as a result, DB Cargo was renamed Railion Deutschland. At this point, the general objective pursued by Deutsche Bahn was to better cover the entire transport chain with all transportation means and routes. Over the years that followed, however, this approach mainly resulted in a shift of its freight transport activities from the rail to the road. The company realised that it needed to improve the links between its rail and road transport in particular, and securing acquisitions was one way to do so. In 2009, Deutsche Bahn abandoned the Railion brand and instead chose to consolidate all of its rail freight transport activities under the name DB Schenker Rail. Its organisational structure initially remained unchanged. Media reports, however, already began to speculate about a stock market launch of the newly formed DB Schenker division. = Company restructuring = The business operations of DB Schenker Rail experienced a significant decline in the 2010s. One of the main factors behind this decline was the economic slump following the global economic and financial crisis. The company initially responded to this negative development by introducing a more flexible price structure. It aimed to use a combination of block trains for large clients and bookings of single wagons to establish a fixed timetable that would in turn increase the capacity utilisation of its trains. Other measures considered included closing freight railway stations in order to reduce fixed costs and making job cuts. These measures were met with sharp criticism by the trade unions, which demanded that the tough cost-cutting approach be stopped immediately. They even accused the company of mismanagement. After negotiations lasting several months, Deutsche Bahn Group and its works council finally agreed on a restructuring programme for DB Cargo that avoided across-the-board job cuts in 2017. The new approach instead aimed to gradually cut back on jobs over a period of several years. On the whole, however, the company wanted its freight transport activities to grow. To reflect the company's focus on its core business activities in the domain of rail freight transport, it was again renamed and designated as DB Cargo AG in 2016. The name was also readopted for its most important German and international subsidiaries and continues to apply in the present day. DB Cargo and DB Schenker are now equal sister companies within the integrated rail system of the DB Group. = Recent developments = According to media reports, DB Cargo reduced its fleet size by nearly a half in the 2000s and 2010s. The remaining locomotives were increasingly replaced by multi-system models that can also be used in the international rail network. The company additionally equipped its inventory of wagons with whisper brakes in order to halve the rolling sounds of its freight trains. On top of all this, it decided to focus on state-of-the-art sensors and telematics, which also improved its competitiveness. To progress its developments in this area, DB Cargo played a leading role in the \\"Innovative Freight Wagons\\" research project conducted on behalf of the German Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure (BWVI) between 2016 and 2019. Although the wagons used by DB Cargo have generally become older in recent years, they have also increased in size so that they can transport larger quantities of goods. Given that the majority of freight is still transported by road, DB Cargo has recently attracted more attraction based on the fact that rail freight transport plays an essential role in achieving climate targets. Within this context and based on expert opinions, the German Federal Government announced plans to transfer millions of lorry trips from road to rail after similar attempts made little progress in previous years. One of the main measures planned to achieve this aim is to gradually optimise the productivity of train drivers. The current changes being implemented at DB Cargo form part of the strategy to strengthen Deutsche Bahn in its entirety that was launched in 2019. During the global outbreak of the novel respiratory disease COVID-19, which hindered cross-border logistics due to limitations in the area of passenger and goods transport, the company was able to secure its transport operations successfully. DB Cargo provided additional capacities for transporting supplies for the population, especially food and hygiene products. Large special transports such as the \\"Pasta Express\\" from Italy most notably attracted headlines.  Organisational structure  DB Cargo AG, a public limited company under German law, acts as a holding company for the operational entities. Its corporate purpose covers rail and road services for the transportation of all kinds of goods and the procurement and operation of stationary and mobile means of transport such as locomotives, railcars, wagons and other containers. Its articles of association also cover related services. The holding company is entitled to carry out all activities deemed to serve the specified business purpose either directly or indirectly. This includes the establishment and management of companies and the acquisition of other companies. = Owners = DB Cargo AG has a share capital of 256,007,000,000 euros, which is divided into 51,201,400 no-par value bearer shares. When it transferred the assets and liabilities of its former freight transport division as part of the spin-off for the establishment of a new company, Deutsche Bahn AG acquired all of the company's shares and is therefore the sole shareholder of DB Cargo AG. A control and profit-and-loss-transfer agreement is in place between the parent company and subsidiary. DB Cargo AG is included in the consolidated financial statement of Deutsche Bahn. The company Deutsche Bahn AG is in turn wholly owned by the Federal Republic of Germany. = Management = Management board  The Board of Management of DB Cargo AG is composed of at least two people, one of whom is responsible for staff-related and social matters in connection with employees. Otherwise, the Supervisory Board determines the number and identities of the members of the Board of Management The current Members of the DB Cargo AG Board of Management are Sigrid Evelyn Nikutta (Chairwoman), Ursula Biernert (Human Resources), Thorsten Dieter (Service), Ralf G√ºnter Klo√ü (Production), Martina Niemann (Finance/Controlling) and Pierre Timmermans (Sales). The percentage of women on the board exceeds the average value of other German companies.  Supervisory board  The Supervisory Board of DB Cargo AG has 20 members. It is composed of shareholder and employee representatives in equal measure, who are elected according to the regulations of the and . The Supervisory Board currently has 6 female and 14 male members. Its Chairman is , who has been the CEO of Deutsche Bahn since 2017. The Vice-Chairman is Martin Burkert, a Member of the Board of the (EVG). Claus Weselsky, Chairman of the German Train Drivers' Union (GDL), is another member of the Supervisory Board, which therefore contains representatives from the two leading trade unions for the rail industry in Germany. = Companies = The business operations of DB Cargo are divided into three regions: Germany, Central Europe and Western & Eastern Europe. The German company DB Cargo AG is responsible for both operational services in the field of rail freight transport in Germany and central functions such as production, sales, finance and human resources for the entire DB Cargo Group. In 2010, Deutsche Bahn joined other rail companies in becoming a partner of the European , represented by its subsidiary DB Schenker Rail (now DB Cargo). Ever since it was first founded, the alliance has focused on the objective of making single wagonload transport, namely freight trains with wagons used by different clients, a more competitive alternative to lorry transport. Xrail also aims to achieve more customer- friendly service, efficiency and punctuality in cross-border transport, for example with its universal booking system, Xrail Capacity Booking (XCB).  Rail freight transport  Within the Deutsche Bahn Group, DB Cargo is mainly responsible for the following subsidiary and sister companies, all of which are directly involved in the domain of rail freight transport: * DB Cargo Belgium, Antwerp, Belgium * DB Cargo Bulgaria, Pirdop, BulgariaDB Cargo Bulgaria EOOD.

The company's core products particularly include block train and single wagonload transport services, the combination of rail and road, and carbon-neutral transport, for example for Audi. The latter is becoming increasingly important given that rail transport currently has the lowest carbon emissions of all carriers and also achieved the largest savings in recent years (1995‚Äì2015). The company additionally offers a wide range of industry solutions, for example for the chemicals industry and the timber and building materials trades. DB Cargo is also active on an international level. Its global operations particularly focus on transport between Europe and Asia, where the company has an extensive network. Its service portfolio also includes related services such as the sale and rental of locomotives and wagons. = Key figures = In the 2018 business year, DB Cargo transported more than 255 million tonnes of goods in 2,686 traction units and 82,895 freight wagons. Leased or hired materials are factored into these totals. The company provided its services on around 4,200 sidings belonging to clients in Germany, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands and Switzerland. It transported goods along a route network covering a total of 33,000 kilometres in Germany and, according to calculations by the (BAG), achieved an average punctuality rate of 72.9% when providing these services.  Criticism  The company is currently generating a loss. Critics accuse Deutsche Bahn of having neglected the necessary maintenance work on and modernisation of the DB Cargo infrastructure and claim that the comparably high average age of its locomotives and wagons is a prime example of this problem. In 2019, the German Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure (BMVI) responded to criticism by the German Federal Court of Auditors regarding the company's lack of investments by arguing that DB Cargo and other segments had yet to exhaust their full potential. Single wagonload transport plays a special role in the observation of the economic development of DB Cargo. Experts are currently demanding that the company subsidise its activities or shrink its business in this area in order to remain a strong competitive alternative to lorry transport.

Johnson in on June 10, 1968, after the April 4 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and the June 5 assassination of Robert F. Kennedy. Background The National Violence Commission established task forces on assassination, group violence, individual acts of violence, law enforcement, media and violence, firearms, and violence in American history. As reported by John Herbers in the New York Times, the Chairman of the Commission, Milton Eisenhower, stated that the Task Force Report on Individual Acts of Violence was \\"by all odds the most important\\" of the reports written for the Commission. The National Violence Commission was formed only a few months after release of the final report of the Kerner Commission, which assessed the big city protests of the 1960s. In its final report in December 1969, the Violence Commission, as the Kerner Commission, concluded that the most important policy issue was lack of employment and educational opportunity in inner city neighborhoods. The Commission framed lack of inner city opportunity within a larger American economy that prized material success and within a tradition of violence that the media transmitted particularly well: In one of its most important final report passages, the National Violence Commission observed: > To be a young, poor male; to be undereducated and without means of escape > from an oppressive urban environment; to want what the society claims is > available (but mostly to others); to see around oneself illegitimate and > often violent methods being used to achieve material success; and to observe > others using these means with impunity ‚Äì all this is to be burdened with an > enormous set of influences that pull many toward crime and delinquency. To > be also a Negro, Mexican or Puerto Rican American and subject to > discrimination and segregation adds considerably to the pull of these other > criminogenic forces. The Violence Commission recommended new investments in jobs, training and education ‚Äì totaling $20B per year in 1968 dollars. A long run \\"reordering of national priorities\\" was in order, said the Violence Commission, which shared the Kerner Commission‚Äôs moral vision that there could be no higher claim on the nation‚Äôs conscience. A majority of the members of the National Violence Commission, including both Republicans and Democrats, recommended confiscation of most handguns, restrictions on new handgun ownership to those who could demonstrate reasonable need, and identification of rifle and shotgun owners. \\"When in man's long history other great civilizations fell\\", concluded the Violence Commission, \\"it was less often from external assault than from internal decay‚Ä¶The greatness and durability of most civilizations has been finally determined by how they have responded to these challenges from within. Ours will be no exception.\\" Continuation In 1981, the Milton S. Eisenhower Foundation was formed as the private sector continuation of both the National Violence Commission and Kerner Commission. Founding and other early Eisenhower Foundation Trustees included: A. Leon Higginbotham, former Vice Chair of the National Violence Commission and federal Third Circuit Court of Appeals Judge; Fred Harris, former Member of the Kerner Riot Commission and former United States Senator; Nicholas deB. Katzenbach, former Chairman of the 1966 President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice and former Attorney General of the United States; David Ginsburg, former Executive Director of the Kerner Riot Commission and Counselor to the President during the Johnson Administration; Milton Eisenhower, former Chair of the National Violence Commission and President Emeritus of Johns Hopkins University; Patricia Roberts Harris, former Member of the National Violence Commission and former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development; Edward Brooke, former Member of the Kerner Riot Commission and former United States Senator; Marvin Wolfgang, former Co-Director of Research on the National Violence Commission and Professor of Criminology at the University of Pennsylvania; Henry Cisneros, former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and former Mayor of San Antonio; Lloyd Cutler, former Executive Director of the National Violence Commission and former Counselor to Presidents Carter and Clinton; Elmer Staats, former Comptroller General of the United States; James Rouse, President of the Rouse Corporation and Founder of the Enterprise Foundation; Frank Stanton, former President of CBS, Inc., and Chairman of the American Red Cross; and Alan Curtis, President of the Eisenhower Foundation. Mindful of the findings of the two Commissions, the Trustees of the Foundation focused on the inner city. As it evolved, the Foundation‚Äôs mission was to identify, finance, replicate, evaluate, communicate, advocate for and scale up politically feasible multiple solution inner city ventures. The priority was on wraparound and evidence based strategies that worked for the inner city and high risk racial minority youth. Over the decades, examples of evidence-based inner city Eisenhower Foundation successes have included the Quantum Opportunities Program, the Youth Safe Haven-Police Ministation Program, the Argus Learning for Living Program and Full Service Community Schools. Updates The Eisenhower Foundation has released two updates of the National Violence Commission, as well as updates of the Kerner Riot Commission. Eisenhower Foundation President Alan Curtis edited the Foundation‚Äôs 15 year update of the Violence Commission, published by Yale University Press in 1985. Curtis and Eisenhower Foundation Trustee Elliott Currie, Professor of Criminology, Law and Society at the University of California, Irvine, co-authored the Foundation‚Äôs 30 year update in 1999. The 1985 National Violence Commission update was featured on the CBS Evening News with Dan Rather and presented in a forum at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, a forum at the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, and a forum at the United States Senate at which Senator Edward Kennedy was keynote speaker. The Senate forum was published in a special issue of the Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science edited by Curtis and covered in a story in Foundation News. The Foundation News story concluded: > The policy message that emerged from the [Senate forum] participants was > clear. Using a public-private approach, efforts should be made to combine > employment, community involvement and family to prevent crime; move away > from a federal policy of increased incarceration; reverse the \\"trickle down\\" > policy of federal anti-crime programs affecting neighborhoods to a \\"bubble- > up\\" process emanating from the local level; and formulate a new cooperative > role for police as supporters, not strictly enforcers. Titled To Establish Justice, To Insure Domestic Tranquility, the 1999 update of the National Violence Commission was featured in a debate on the PBS News Hour with Jim Lehrer. Curtis observed to reporter Ray Suarez: > The original Violence Commission predicted that we would have a city of the > future in which the middle class would escape to the suburbs, drive to work > in sanitized quarters, and work in buildings protected by high tech. That > city of the future has come true. An editorial in the Detroit Free Press > said that city was Detroit. Domestic tranquility is roughly the same [in > 1999 as in 1969] in spite of the increase in prison building. On the other > hand, we haven‚Äôt had an increase in justice. We have 25 percent of all our > young children living in poverty. We have the greatest inequality in terms > of wealth and income and wages in the world. One of every three African- > Americans is in prison, on probation or on parole at any one time ‚Äì and one > out of every two in cities. That is a direct result of the racial bias in > our sentencing system and our mandatory minimum sentences. For example, > crack-cocaine sentences are longer, and crack cocaine is used more by > minorities. Powder cocaine sentences are shorter, and powder cocaine is used > more by whites. The result is that our prison populations are > disproportionately filled with racial minorities. Yet, at the same time, > prison building has become a kind of economic development policy for [white] > communities which send lobbyists to Washington. In addition, the National Violence Commission updates were covered by news stories in the Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, Newsweek and USA Today, interviews on NPR, and editorials in the Detroit Free Press, Philadelphia Daily News and Chicago Tribune, among other media. For example, the 1999 Detroit Free Press editorial focused on the Violence Commission‚Äôs 1969 \\"city of the future\\" prediction of \\"suburban neighborhoods, increasingly far-removed from the central city, with homes fortified by an array of security devices; high-speed police-patrolled expressways becoming sterilized corridors connecting safe areas [and] urban streets that will be unsafe in differing degrees‚Ä¶That was in 1969. Sounds like any metropolitan area you know?\\" Firearms policy In 2012, after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, the Washington Post published commentary by Curtis that reminded the nation of how, in 1969, a majority of National Violence Commission members, including both Republicans and Democrats, recommended confiscation of most handguns, restrictions on new handgun ownership to those who could demonstrate reasonable need, and identification of rifle and shotgun owners. Given that America is the only advanced industrialized nation in the world without effective firearms regulations and given that America, not surprisingly, therefore leads the industrialized world in firearms killings, the Foundation believes a new grassroots coalition against firearms in America should build on the recommendations of the National Violence Commission and better integrate the advocacy of, among others, the Brady Campaign, Mayors Against Illegal Guns, the Children's Defense Fund, racial minorities, women, outraged parents, teachers, youthful voters, grandparents and voters who view firearms control as a key policy against terrorist acts and mass killings.

As the head of the Kriminalpolizei (criminal police) in Munich, Frick took part in Hitler's failed Beer Hall Putsch of 1923, for which he was convicted of high treason. He managed to avoid imprisonment and soon afterwards became a leading figure of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) in the Reichstag. After Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933, Frick joined the new government and was named Reich Minister of the Interior. He was instrumental in formulating laws that consolidated the Nazi regime (Gleichschaltung), as well as laws that defined the Nazi racial policy, most notoriously the Nuremberg Laws. Following the rise of the SS, Frick gradually lost favour within the party, and in 1943 he was replaced by Heinrich Himmler as interior minister. Frick remained in the cabinet as a minister without portfolio until Hitler's death in 1945. After World War II, Frick was tried and convicted of war crimes at the Nuremberg trials and executed by hanging. Early life and family Frick was born in the Palatinate municipality of Alsenz, then part of the Kingdom of Bavaria, Germany, the last of four children of Protestant teacher Wilhelm Frick sen. (d. 1918) and his wife Henriette (n√©e Schmidt). He attended the gymnasium in Kaiserslautern, passing his Abitur exams in 1896. He went on studying philology at the University of Munich, but soon after turned to study law in Heidelberg and Berlin, taking the Staatsexamen in 1900, followed by his doctorate the next year. Serving as a referendary from 1900, he joined the Bavarian civil service in 1903, working as an attorney at the Munich Police Department. He was appointed a Bezirksamtassessor in Pirmasens in 1907 and became acting district executive in 1914. Rejected as unfit, Frick did not serve in World War I. He was promoted to the official rank of a Regierungsassessor and, at his own request, re-assumed his post at the Munich Police Department in 1917. On 25 April 1910, Frick married Elisabetha Emilie Nagel (1890‚Äì1978) in Pirmasens. They had two sons and a daughter. The marriage ended in an ugly divorce in 1934. A few weeks later, on 12 March, Frick remarried in M√ºnchberg Margarete Schultze-Naumburg (1896‚Äì1960), the former wife of the Nazi Reichstag MP Paul Schultze-Naumburg. Margarete gave birth to a son and a daughter. Nazi career Frick (3rd from left) among the defendants in the Munich Beer Hall Putsch trial, 1924. Adolf Hitler is 4th from the right. In Munich, Frick witnessed the end of the war and the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì1919. He sympathized with Freikorps paramilitary units fighting against the Bavarian government of Premier Kurt Eisner. Chief of Police Ernst P√∂hner introduced him to Adolf Hitler, whom he helped willingly with obtaining permissions to hold political rallies and demonstrations. Elevated to the rank of an Oberamtmann and head of the Kriminalpolizei (criminal police) from 1923, he and P√∂hner participated in Hitler's failed Beer Hall Putsch on 9 November. Frick tried to suppress the State Police's operation, wherefore he was arrested and imprisoned, and tried for aiding and abetting high treason by the People's Court in April 1924. After several months in custody, he was given a suspended sentence of 15 months' imprisonment and was dismissed from his police job. Later during the disciplinary proceedings, the dismissal was declared unfair and revoked, on the basis that his treasonous intention had not been proven. Frick went on to work at the Munich social insurance office from 1926 onwards, in the rank of a Regierungsrat 1st class by 1933. In the aftermath of the putsch, Wilhelm Frick was elected a member of the German Reichstag parliament in the federal election of May 1924. He had been nominated by the National Socialist Freedom Movement, an electoral list of the far-right German V√∂lkisch Freedom Party and then banned Nazi Party. On 1 September 1925, Frick joined the re-established Nazi Party. On 20 May 1928, he was one of the first 12 deputies elected to the Reichstag as Nazi Party members. He associated himself with the radical Gregor Strasser; making his name by aggressive anti-democratic and antisemitic Reichstag speeches, he climbed to the post of the Nazi parliamentary group leader (Fraktionsf√ºhrer) in 1928. He would continue to be elected to the Reichstag in every subsequent election in the Weimar and Nazi regimes. In 1929, as the price for joining the coalition government of the Land (state) of Thuringia, the NSDAP received the state ministries of the Interior and Education. On 23 January 1930, Frick was appointed to these ministries, becoming the first Nazi to hold a ministerial-level post at any level in Germany (though he remained a member of the Reichstag). Frick used his position to dismiss Communist and Social Democratic officials and replace them with Nazi Party members, so Thuringia's federal subsidies were temporarily suspended by Reich Minister Carl Severing. Frick also appointed the eugenicist Hans F. K. G√ºnther as a professor of social anthropology at the University of Jena, banned several newspapers, and banned pacifist drama and anti-war films such as All Quiet on the Western Front. He was removed from office by a Social Democratic motion of no confidence in the Thuringian Landtag parliament on 1 April 1931. Reich Minister Press session after the first meeting of Hitler's cabinet on 30 January 1933: Frick standing 4th from left When Reich president Paul von Hindenburg appointed Hitler chancellor on 30 January 1933, Frick joined his government as Reichsminister of the Interior. Together with Reichstag President Hermann G√∂ring, he was one of only two Nazi Reichsministers in the original Hitler Cabinet, and the only one who actually had a portfolio; G√∂ring served as minister without portfolio until 5 May. Though Frick held a key position, especially in organizing the federal elections of March 1933, he initially had far less power than his counterparts in the rest of Europe. Notably, he had no authority over the police; in Germany law enforcement has traditionally been a state and local matter. Indeed, the main reason that Hindenburg and Franz von Papen agreed to give the Interior Ministry to the Nazis was that it was almost powerless at the time. A mighty rival arose in the establishment of the Propaganda Ministry under Joseph Goebbels on 13 March. Frick's power dramatically increased as a result of the Reichstag Fire Decree and the Enabling Act of 1933. The provision of the Reichstag Fire Decree giving the cabinet the power to take over state governments on its own authority was actually his idea; he saw the fire as a chance to increase his power and begin the process of Nazifying the country. He was responsible for drafting many of the Gleichschaltung laws that consolidated the Nazi regime. Within a few days of the Enabling Act's passage, Frick helped draft a law appointing Reichskommissare to disempower the state governments. Under the Law for the Reconstruction of the Reich, which converted Germany into a highly centralized state, the newly implemented Reichsstatthalter (state governors) were directly responsible to him. On 10 October 1933, Hitler appointed him a Reichsleiter, the second highest political rank in the Nazi Party. In May 1934, he was appointed Prussian Minister of the Interior under Minister-President G√∂ring, which gave him control over the police in Prussia. By 1935, he also had near-total control over local government. He had the sole power to appoint the mayors of all municipalities with populations greater than 100,000 (except for the city states of Berlin and Hamburg, where Hitler reserved the right to appoint the mayors himself if he deemed it necessary). He also had considerable influence over smaller towns as well; while their mayors were appointed by the state governors, as mentioned earlier the governors were responsible to him. Frick (2nd from left) with Konrad Henlein on visit in Sudetenland, 1938 Frick was instrumental in the racial policy of Nazi Germany drafting laws against Jewish citizens, like the \\"Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service\\" and the notorious Nuremberg Laws in September 1935. Already in July 1933, he had implemented the Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring including forced sterilizations, which later culminated in the killings of the Action T4 \\"euthanasia\\" programme supported by his ministry. Frick also took a leading part in Germany's re-armament in violation of the 1919 Versailles Treaty. He drafted laws introducing universal military conscription and extending the Wehrmacht service law to Austria after the 1938 Anschluss, as well as to the \\"Sudetenland\\" territories of the First Czechoslovak Republic annexed according to the Munich Agreement. In the summer of 1938 Frick was named the patron (Schirmherr) of the Deutsches Turn- und Sportfest in Breslau, a patriotic sports festival attended by Hitler and much of the Nazi leadership. In this event he presided the ceremony of \\"handing over\\" the new Nazi Reich Sports League (NSRL) standard to Reichssportf√ºhrer Hans von Tschammer und Osten, marking the further nazification of sports in Germany.Dr. Frick presiding the Breslau Games On 11 November 1938, Frick promulgated the Regulations Against Jews' Possession of Weapons. From the mid-to-late 1930s Frick lost favour irreversibly within the Nazi Party after a power struggle involving attempts to resolve the lack of coordination within the Reich government.A legalistic follower, rather than an initiator, Frick the servant increasingly lost favour with his master, apparently because he misunderstood the basic nature of the Fuhrer's governance. Whereas the Third Reich thrived on inconsistencies, rivalries, and constant evolutionary change, Frick's juristic mind longed for order and legal stabilization. The incongruity was insuperable and it was thus logical enough that in 1943 the minister, whose share of practical power had rapidly diminished in the second half of the 1930s, ultimately even lost his official post.Udo Sautter, Canadian Journal of History For example, in 1933 he tried to restrict the widespread use of \\"protective custody\\" orders that were used to send people to concentration camps, only to be begged off by Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler. His power was greatly reduced in June 1936 when Hitler named Himmler the Chief of German Police, which effectively united the police with the SS. On paper, Frick was Himmler's immediate superior. In fact, the police were now independent of Frick's control, since the SS was responsible only to Hitler.Longerich, Peter (2012). Heinrich Himmler: A Life, Oxford University Press, p. 204.Williams, Max (2001). Reinhard Heydrich: The Biography: Volume 1, Ulric, p. 77. A long- running power struggle between the two culminated in Frick's being replaced by Himmler as Reichsminister of the Interior in August 1943. However, he remained in the cabinet as a Reichsminister without portfolio. Besides Hitler, he and Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk were the only members of the Third Reich's cabinet to serve continuously from Hitler's appointment as Chancellor until his death. Frick's replacement as Reichsminister of the Interior did not reduce the growing administrative chaos and infighting between party and state agencies.Hans Mommsen, The Dissolution of the Third Reich (1943‚Äì1945) Frick was then appointed as Protector of Bohemia and Moravia, making him Hitler's personal representative in the Czech Lands. Its capital Prague, where Frick used ruthless methods to counter dissent, was one of the last Axis-held cities to fall at the end of World War II in Europe.Trial:Wilhelm Frick Trial and execution Frick in his cell, November 1945 The corpse of Frick after his execution at Nuremberg, 1946 Frick was arrested and tried before the Nuremberg trials, where he was the only defendant besides Rudolf Hess who refused to testify on his own behalf. Frick was convicted of planning, initiating and waging wars of aggression, war crimes and crimes against humanity, and for his role in formulating the Enabling Act as Minister of the Interior and the Nuremberg Laws ‚Äì under these laws people were deported to concentration camps, and many of those were murdered there. Frick was also accused of being one of the highest persons responsible for the existence of the concentration camps. Frick was sentenced to death on 1 October 1946, and was hanged at Nuremberg Prison on 16 October. Of his execution, journalist Joseph Kingsbury-Smith wrote: His body, as those of the other nine executed men and the corpse of Hermann G√∂ring, was cremated at Ostfriedhof (Munich) and the ashes were scattered in the river Isar.

Cunningham, written by Victor Miller, and starring Betsy Palmer, Adrienne King, Harry Crosby, Laurie Bartram, Mark Nelson, Jeannine Taylor, Robbi Morgan, and Kevin Bacon. Its plot follows a group of teenage camp counselors who are murdered one by one by an unknown killer while attempting to re-open an abandoned summer camp. Prompted by the success of John Carpenter's Halloween (1978), director Cunningham put out an advertisement to sell the film in Variety in early 1979, while Miller was still drafting the screenplay. After casting the film in New York City, filming took place in New Jersey in the summer of 1979, on an estimated budget of $550,000. A bidding war ensued over the finished film, ending with Paramount Pictures acquiring the film for domestic distribution, while Warner Bros. Pictures secured European distribution rights. Released on May 9, 1980, Friday the 13th was a major box office success, grossing $59.8 million worldwide. Critical response was divided, with some praising the film's cinematography, score, and performances, while numerous others derided it for its depiction of graphic violence. Aside from being the first independent film of its kind to secure distribution in the U.S. by a major studio, its box office success led to a long series of sequels, a crossover with the A Nightmare on Elm Street film series, and a 2009 series reboot. A direct sequel, Friday the 13th Part 2, was released one year later.  Plot  In 1958 at Camp Crystal Lake, counselors Barry Jackson and Claudette Hayes sneak inside a storage cabin to have sex, where an unseen assailant murders them. Twenty-one years later, camp counselor Annie Phillips is driven halfway to the reopened Camp Crystal Lake by Enos, a truck driver, despite being warned by elderly Crazy Ralph. While driving, Enos warns Annie about the camp's troubled past, which involved a young boy drowning in Crystal Lake in 1957. After being dropped off, she hitches another ride from an unseen person, who chases her into the woods and slashes her throat. At the camp, counselors Ned Rubenstein, Jack Burrell, Bill Brown, Marcie Cunningham, Brenda Jones, and Alice Hardy, along with owner Steve Christy, refurbish the cabins and facilities. As a thunderstorm approaches, Steve leaves the campground to stock supplies. Ned sees someone walk into a cabin and follows. While Jack and Marcie have sex in one of the cabin's bunk beds, they are unaware of Ned's body above them, his throat having been slit. When Marcie leaves to use the bathroom, Jack's throat is pierced with an arrow from beneath the bed. The killer follows Marcie into the bathrooms and slams an axe into her face. Brenda hears a voice calling for help and ventures outside to the archery range, where the lights turn on. Later, Steve returns and recognizes the unseen killer, who stabs him. Worried by their friends' disappearances, Alice and Bill leave the main cabin to investigate. They find the axe in Brenda's bed, the phones disconnected, and Ned's truck inoperable. When the power goes out, Bill goes to check on the generator. Alice heads out to look for him and finds his body pinned with arrows to the generator room's door. She flees to the main cabin to hide, only to be traumatized further when Brenda's body is thrown through the window. Soon after, Alice sees a vehicle pull up and rushes outside, thinking it is Steve. Instead, she is greeted by Mrs. Voorhees, a middle-aged woman who claims to be an old friend of Steve and his family. She reveals that her son, Jason, was the young boy who drowned in 1957, blaming his death on the counselors who were supposed to be watching him, but were having sex instead. Revealing herself as the killer, she attempts to kill Alice, but Alice knocks her unconscious. At the shore, she tries to kill her again with a machete, but Alice gains the advantage and decapitates her. Exhausted, Alice boards and falls asleep inside a canoe which floats out on Crystal Lake. Suddenly, Jason‚Äôs decomposing corpse attacks her, at which point she awakens in a hospital surrounded by a police sergeant and medical staff who are tending to her. When Alice asks about Jason, the sergeant says there was no sign of any boy. She says, \\"Then he's still there,\\" as the lake is shown at peace. CastProduction=Development= Friday the 13th did not have a completed script when Sean S. Cunningham took out this advertisement in Variety magazine Friday the 13th was produced and directed by Sean S. Cunningham, who had previously worked with filmmaker Wes Craven on the film The Last House on the Left. Cunningham, inspired by John Carpenter's Halloween, wanted Friday the 13th to be shocking, visually stunning and \\"[make] you jump out of your seat.\\" Wanting to distance himself from The Last House on the Left, Cunningham wanted Friday the 13th to be more of a \\"roller-coaster ride.\\" The original screenplay was tentatively titled A Long Night at Camp Blood. While working on a redraft of the screenplay, Cunningham proposed the title Friday the 13th, after which Miller began redeveloping. Cunningham rushed out to place an advertisement in Variety using the Friday the 13th title. Worried that someone else owned the rights to the title and wanting to avoid potential lawsuits, Cunningham thought it would be best to find out immediately. He commissioned a New York advertising agency to develop his concept of the Friday the 13th logo, which consisted of big block letters bursting through a pane of glass. In the end, Cunningham believed there were \\"no problems\\" with the title, but distributor George Mansour stated, \\"There was a movie before ours called Friday the 13th: The Orphan. It was moderately successful. But someone still threatened to sue. Either Phil Scuderi paid them off, but it was finally resolved.\\" The screenplay was completed in mid-1979 by Victor Miller, who later went on to write for several television soap operas, including Guiding Light, One Life to Live and All My Children; at the time, Miller was living in Stratford, Connecticut, near Cunningham, and the two had begun collaborating on potential film projects. Miller delighted in inventing a serial killer who turned out to be somebody's mother, a murderer whose only motivation was her love for her child. \\"I took motherhood and turned it on its head and I think that was great fun. Mrs. Voorhees was the mother I'd always wanted‚Äîa mother who would have killed for her kids.\\" Miller was unhappy about the filmmakers' decision to make Jason Voorhees the killer in the sequels. \\"Jason was dead from the very beginning. He was a victim, not a villain.\\" The idea of Jason appearing at the end of the film was initially not used in the original script; in Miller's final draft, the film ended with Alice merely floating on the lake. Jason's appearance was actually suggested by makeup designer Tom Savini. Savini stated that \\"The whole reason for the cliffhanger at the end was I had just seen Carrie, so we thought that we need a 'chair jumper' like that, and I said, 'let's bring in Jason'\\". =Casting= A New York-based firm, headed by Julie Hughes and Barry Moss, was hired to find eight young actors to play the camp's staff members. Cunningham admits that he was not looking for \\"great actors,\\" but anyone that was likable, and appeared to be a responsible camp counselor. The way Cunningham saw it, the actors would need to look good, read the dialogue somewhat well, and work cheap. Moss and Hughes were happy to find four actors, Kevin Bacon, Laurie Bartram, Peter Brouwer, and Adrienne King, who had previously appeared on soap operas. The role of Alice Hardy was set up as an open casting call, a publicity stunt used to attract more attention to the film. King earned an audition primarily because she was the friend of someone working in Moss and Hughes's office, and Cunningham felt she embodied the qualities of Alice. After she auditioned, Moss recalls Cunningham commenting that they saved the best actress for last. As Cunningham explains, he was looking for people that could behave naturally, and King was able to show that to him in the audition. With King cast in the role of lead heroine Alice, Laurie Bartram was hired to play Brenda. Kevin Bacon, Mark Nelson and Jeannine Taylor, who had known each other prior to the film, were cast as Jack, Ned, and Marcie respectively. It is Bacon and Nelson's contention that, because the three already knew each other, they already had the specific chemistry the casting director was looking for in the roles of Jack, Ned, and Marcie. Taylor has stated that Hughes and Moss were highly regarded while she was an actress, so when they offered her an audition she felt that, whatever the part, it would \\"be a good opportunity.\\" Friday the 13th was Nelson's first feature film, and when he went in for his first audition the only thing he was given to read were some comedic scenes. Nelson received a call back for a second audition, which required him to wear a bathing suit, which Nelson acknowledges made him start to wonder if something was off about this film. He did not fully realize what was going on until he got the part and was given the full script to read. Nelson explains, \\"It certainly was not a straight dramatic role, and it was only after they offered me the part that they gave me the full script to read and I realized how much blood was in it.\\" Nelson believes that Ned used humor to hide his insecurities, especially around Brenda, whom the actor believes Ned was attracted to. Nelson recalls an early draft of the script stating that Ned suffered from polio, and his legs were deformed while his upper body was muscular. Ned is believed to have given birth to the \\"practical joker victim\\" of horror films. According to author David Grove, there was no equivalent character in John Carpenter's Halloween, or Bob Clark's Black Christmas before that. He served as a model for the slasher films that would follow Friday the 13th. The part of Bill was given to Harry Crosby, son of Bing Crosby. Robbi Morgan, who plays Annie, was not auditioning for the film when she was offered the role; while in her office, Hughes looked at Morgan and proclaimed \\"you're a camp counselor.\\" The next day Morgan was on the set. Morgan only appeared on-set for a day to shoot all her scenes. Rex Everhart, who portrays Enos, did not film the truck scenes with Morgan, so she had to either act with an imaginary Enos, or exchange dialogue with Taso Stavrakis‚ÄîSavini's assistant‚Äîwho would sit in the truck with her. It was Peter Brouwer's girlfriend that helped him land a role on Friday the 13th. After recently being written off the show Love of Life, Brouwer moved back to Connecticut to look for work. Learning that his girlfriend was working as an assistant director for Friday the 13th, Brouwer asked about any openings. Initially told casting was looking for big stars to fill the role of Steve Christy, it was not until Sean Cunningham dropped by to deliver a message to Brouwer's girlfriend, and saw him working in a garden, that Brouwer was hired. Estelle Parsons was initially asked to portray the film's killer, Mrs. Voorhees, but eventually declined. Her agent cited that the film was too violent, and did not know what kind of actress would play such a part. Hughes and Moss sent a copy of the script to Betsy Palmer, in hopes that she would accept the part. Palmer could not understand why someone would want her for a part in a horror film, as she had previously starred in films such as Mister Roberts, The Angry Man, and The Tin Star. Palmer only agreed to play the role because she needed to buy a new car, even when she believed the film to \\"be a piece of shit.\\" Stavrakis subbed for Betsy Palmer as well, which involved Morgan's character being chased through the woods by Mrs. Voorhees, although the audience only sees a pair of legs running after Morgan. Palmer had just arrived in town when those scenes were about to be filmed, and was not in the physical shape necessary to chase Morgan around the woods. Morgan's training as an acrobat assisted her in these scenes, as her character was required to leap out of a moving jeep when she discovers that Mrs. Voorhees does not intend to take her to the camp. Betsy Palmer explains how she developed the character of Mrs. Voorhees: Cunningham wanted to make the Mrs. Voorhees character \\"terrifying\\", and to that end he believed it was important that Palmer not act \\"over the top.\\" There was also the fear that Palmer's past credits, as more of a wholesome character, would make it difficult to believe she could be scary. Palmer was paid $1000 per day for her ten days on set. Ari Lehman, who had previously auditioned for Cunningham's Manny's Orphans, failing to get the part, was determined to land the role of Jason Voorhees. According to Lehman, he went in very intense and afterward Cunningham told him he was perfect for the part. In addition to the main cast, Walt Gorney came on as \\"Crazy Ralph\\", the town's soothsayer. The character of Crazy Ralph was meant to establish two functions: foreshadow the events to come, and insinuate that he could actually be the murderer. Cunningham has stated that he was apprehensive about including the character, and is not sure if he accomplished his goal of creating a new suspect. =Filming= The film was shot in and around the townships of Hardwick, Blairstown, and Hope, in Warren County, New Jersey in September 1979. The camp scenes were shot on a working Boy Scout camp, Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco which is located in Hardwick. The camp is still standing and still operates as a summer camp. The cinematography in the film employs recurrent point-of-view shots from the perspective of the villain. Savini was hired to design the film's special effects based upon his work in George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead (1978). Savini's design contributions included crafting the effects of Marcie's axe wound to the face, the arrow penetrating Jack's throat, and Mrs. Voorhees's decapitation by the machete. During the filming of the fight sequences between King and Palmer's characters, Palmer suggested rehearsing the scene based on her theater training: \\"I said to Adrienne that night 'Why don't we rehearse this scene, I have to slap you,' because on-stage when you slap somebody, you slap them.\\" While rehearsing, Palmer slapped King in the face, and she began crying: \\"She collapsed to the floor, crying, 'Sean! [Cunningham] She hit me.' I said, well, of course I hit her, we were rehearsing the scene. He said, 'No, no, no Betsy, we don't hit people in movies. We miss them.\\" =Music= When Harry Manfredini began working on the musical score, the decision was made to only play music when the killer was actually present so as to not \\"manipulate the audience\\". Manfredini pointed out the lack of music for certain scenes: \\"There's a scene where one of the girls ... is setting up the archery area ... One of the guys shoots an arrow into the target and just misses her. It's a huge scare, but if you notice, there's no music. That was a choice.\\" Manfredini also noted that when something was going to happen, the music would cut off so that the audience would relax a bit, and the scare would be that much more effective. Because the killer, Mrs. Voorhees, appears onscreen only during the final scenes of the film, Manfredini had the job of creating a score that would represent the killer in her absence. Manfredini borrows from the 1975 film Jaws, where the shark is likewise not seen for the majority of the film but the motif created by John Williams cued the audience to the shark's invisible menace. Sean S. Cunningham sought a chorus, but the budget would not allow it. While listening to a Krzysztof Penderecki piece of music, which contained a chorus with \\"striking pronunciations\\", Manfredini was inspired to recreate a similar sound. He came up with the sound \\"ki ki ki, ma ma ma\\" from the final reel when Mrs. Voorhees arrives and is reciting \\"Kill her, mommy!\\" The \\"ki\\" comes from \\"kill\\", and the \\"ma\\" from \\"mommy\\". To achieve the unique sound he wanted for the film, Manfredini spoke the two words \\"harshly, distinctly and rhythmically into a microphone\\" and ran them into an echo reverberation machine. Manfredini finished the original score after a couple of weeks, and then recorded the score in a friend's basement. Victor Miller and assistant editor Jay Keuper have commented on how memorable the music is, with Keuper describing it as \\"iconographic\\". Manfredini says, \\"Everybody thinks it's cha, cha, cha. I'm like, 'Cha, cha, cha? What are you talking about?'\\" In 1982, Gramavision Records released a LP record of selected pieces of Harry Manfredini's scores from the first three Friday the 13th films. On 13 January 2012, La-La Land Records released a limited edition 6-CD boxset containing Manfredini's scores from the first six films. It sold out in less than 24 hours. Release=Distribution= A bidding war over distribution rights to the film ensued in 1980 between Paramount Pictures, Warner Bros., and United Artists. Paramount executive Frank Mancuso, Sr. recalled: \\"The minute we saw Friday the 13th, we knew we had a hit.\\" Paramount ultimately purchased domestic distribution rights for Friday the 13th for $1.5 million. Based on the success of recently released horror films (such as Halloween) and the low budget of the film, the studio deemed it a \\"low-risk\\" release in terms of profitability. It was the first independent slasher film to be acquired by a major motion picture studio. Paramount spent approximately $500,000 in advertisements for the film, and then an additional $500,000 when the film began performing well at the box office. =Marketing= A full one- sheet poster, featuring a group of teenagers imposed beneath the silhouette of a knife-wielding figure, was designed by artist Alex Ebel to promote the film's U.S. release. Scholar Richard Nowell has observed that the poster and marketing campaign presented Friday the 13th as a \\"light-hearted\\" and \\"youth- oriented\\" horror film in an attempt to draw interest from America's prime theater-going demographic of young adults and teenagers. Warner Bros. secured distribution rights to the film in international markets. = Home media = Friday the 13th was first released on DVD in the United States by Paramount Home Entertainment on October 19, 1999. The disc sold 32,497 units. On February 3, 2009, Paramount released the film again on DVD and Blu-ray in an unrated uncut, for the first time in the United States (previous VHS, LaserDisc and DVD releases included the R-rated theatrical version). The uncut version of the film contains approximately 11 seconds of previously unreleased footage. In 2011, the uncut version of Friday the 13th was released in a 4-disc DVD collection with the first three sequels. It was again included in three Blu-ray sets: Friday the 13th: The Complete Collection, released in 2013, Friday the 13th: The Ultimate Collection, in 2018 and Friday the 13th: 40th Anniversary Limited Edition in 2020. In 2020, to celebrate the film‚Äôs 40th anniversary, Shout! Factory released a 4K scan of the original film, as well as parts 2-4, in a complete series box set. Reception= Box office = Friday the 13th opened theatrically on May 9, 1980 across the United States, ultimately expanding its release to 1,127 theaters. It earned $5,816,321 in its opening weekend, before finishing domestically with $39,754,601, with a total of 14,778,700 admissions. It was the 18th highest- grossing film that year, facing competition from other high-profile horror releases such as The Shining, Dressed To Kill, The Fog, and Prom Night. The worldwide gross for the film was $59,754,601. Of the seventeen films distributed by Paramount in 1980, only one, Airplane!, returned more profits than Friday the 13th. Friday the 13th was released internationally, which was unusual for an independent film with, at the time, no well-recognized or bankable actors; aside from well-known television and movie actress Betsy Palmer. The film would take in approximately $20 million in international box office receipts. Not factoring in international sales, or the cross-over film with A Nightmare on Elm Street's Freddy Krueger, the original Friday the 13th is the highest-grossing film of the franchise. To provide context with the box office gross of films in 2014, the cost of making and promoting Friday the 13th‚Äîwhich includes the $550,000 budget and the $1 million in advertisement‚Äîis approximately $4.5 million. With regard to the US box office gross, the film would have made $177.72 million in adjusted 2017 dollars. On July 13, 2007, Friday the 13th was screened for the first time on Blairstown's Main Street in the very theater which appears shortly after the opening credits. Overflowing crowds forced the Blairstown Theater Festival, the sponsoring organization, to add an extra screening. A 30th Anniversary Edition was released on March 10, 2010. A 35th-anniversary screening was held in the Griffith Park Zoo as part of the Great Horror Campout on March 13, 2015. = Critical response =Original theatrical reviews Linda Gross of the Los Angeles Times referred to the film as a \\"silly, boring, youth-geared horror movie,\\" though she praised Manfredini's \\"nervous musical score,\\" the cinematography, as well as the performances, which she deemed \\"natural and appealing,\\" particularly from Taylor, Bacon, Nelson, and Bartram. Variety, however, deemed the film \\"low budget in the worst sense‚Äîwith no apparent talent or intelligence to offset its technical inadequacies‚ÄîFriday the 13th has nothing to exploit but its title.\\" The Miami Newss Bill von Maurer praised Cunningham's \\"low-key\\" direction, but noted: \\"After building terrific suspense and turning over the audience's stomachs, he doesn't quite know where to go from there. The movie begins to sag in the middle and the expectations he has built up begin to sour a bit.\\" Lou Cedrone of The Baltimore Evening Sun referred to the film as \\"a shamelessly bad film, but then Cunningham knows this. This is sad.\\" Many critics compared the film unfavorably against John Carpenter's Halloween, among them Marylynn Uricchio of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, who added: \\"Friday the 13th is minimal on plot, suspense, and characterization. It's not very original or very scary, but it is very low-budget.\\" Dick Shippy of the Akron Beacon Journal similarly suggested that Carpenter's Halloween played \\"like Hitchcock when compared to Cunningham's dreadful tale of butchery.\\" The Burlington Free Presss Mike Hughes wrote that the film \\"copies everything, that is, except the quality\\" of Halloween, concluding: \\"The lowest point of the movie comes near the end, when it exploits the genuine grief and madness of the villain. By then, things simply aren't fun anymore.\\" Ron Cowan of the Statesman Journal noted the film as a \\"routine 'endangered teenagers' exploitation movie\\", adding that \\"Cunningham betrays a rather plodding approach to suspense for most of the film, sometimes allowing his camera to act as the killer, sometimes as the victim. And the victims, of course, deliberately put themselves in peril.\\" A significant number of reviews criticized the film for its depiction of violence: The Hollywood Reporter derided the film, writing: \\"Gruesome violence, in which throats are slashed and heads are split open in realistic detail, is the sum content of Friday the 13th, a sick and sickening low budget feature that is being released by Paramount. It's blatant exploitation of the lowest order.\\" Michael Blowen of The Boston Globe similarly referred to the film as \\"nauseating,\\" warning audiences: \\"Unless your idea of a good time is to watch a woman have her head split by an ax or a man stuck to a door with arrows, you should stay away from Friday the 13th. It's bad luck.\\" The film's most vocal detractor was Gene Siskel, who in his review called Cunningham \\"one of the most despicable creatures ever to infest the movie business.\\" He also published the address for Charles Bluhdorn, the chairman of the board of Gulf+Western, which owned Paramount, as well as Betsy Palmer's home city and encouraged fellow detractors to write to them and express their contempt for the film. Attempting to convince people not to see it, he even gave away the ending. Siskel and Roger Ebert spent an entire episode of their TV show berating the film (and other slasher films of the time) because they felt it would make audiences root for the killer. Leonard Maltin initially awarded the film one star, or 'BOMB', but later changed his mind and awarded the film a star and-a- half \\"simply because it's slightly better than Part 2\\" and called it a \\"gory, cardboard thriller...That younger viewers made it a box-office juggernaut is one more clue as to why SAT scores keep declining. Still, any movie that spawns this many sequels must have done something right\\". Contemporary On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Friday the 13th holds a 64% approval rating based on 55 reviews, with an average rating of 5.58/10. The consensus reads: \\"Rather quaint by today's standards, Friday the 13th still has its share of bloody surprises and a '70s-holdover aesthetic to slightly compel.\\" Bill Steele of IFC ranked the film the second-best entry in the series, after Friday the 13th Part 2 (1981). Critic Kim Newman, in a 2000 review, awarded the film two out of five stars, referring to it as \\"a pallid Halloween rip-off, with a mediocre shock count and a botched ending ... As the bodies pile up amongst this testy crowd of horny teens, there remains a vacant hole were someone scary should be. In a strange way, this film stands unique amongst all slasher films as one where the killer is nearly intangible.\\" Jeremiah Kipp of Slant Magazine reviewed the film in 2009, noting \\"a kind of minimalism at work, eschewing anything special in terms of mood, pacing, character, plot, and tension.\\" Further commenting on the revelation of the killer's identity, Kipp observed: In 2012, Bill Gibron of PopMatters wrote of the film: \\"This movie feels at least twice as long as its 90 minute running time and not always in a good way. There are far too many pointless pauses between the bloodletting. On the positive side, Tom Savini's make-up work is flawless, and Betsy Palmer's turn as big bad Pamela V. has to go down in history as one of the meanest 'mothers' in the entire horror genre. For those who think it's a classicthink again. Of a type? Absolutely. Of faultless movie macabre? No way.\\" Scott Meslow of The Week reviewed the film in 2015, assessing its original critical reception in a contemporary context: \\"Before it became an absurdly prolific franchise, Friday the 13th was a cynical, one- off attempt to make a fast buck on a sleazy slasher movie that accidentally ended up spawning a decades-spanning, multimillion-dollar phenomenon ... What's most striking about Friday the 13th is how little regard anyone but its fans seem to have for it.\\" =Analysis=Teen sexuality Film scholar Williams views Friday the 13th as \\"symptomatic of its era,\\" particularly Reagan-era America, and part of a trajectory of films such as The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) and Race with the Devil (1975), which \\"exemplify a particular apocalyptic vision moving from disclosing family contradictions to self-indulgent nihilism.\\" The film's recurring use of point-of-view shots from the killer's perspective have been noted by scholars such as Philip Dimare as \\"inherently voyeuristic.\\" Dimare regards the film as a \\"cautionary tale that succeeds in warning against the sexual impropriety even as it fetishizes violent transgression.\\" Film critic Timothy Shary notes in his book Teen Movies: American Youth on Screen (2012) that where Halloween introduced a \\"more subtle sexual curiosity within its morbid moral lesson,\\" films such as Friday the 13th \\"capitali[zed] on the reactionary aspect of teen sexuality, slaughtering wholesale those youth who deigned to cross the threshold of sexual awareness.\\" Commenting on the film's violence and sexuality, film scholar David J. Hogan notes that, \\"throughout the film, teenage boys are hideously dispatched, but not with the same buildup and attention to detail that Cunningham and makeup wiz Tom Savini reserved for nubile young girls.\\" Gender of villain The film has spurred critical discussion in regard to its villain being female, a plot point examined at length by film scholar Carol J. Clover in her book Men, Women, and Chainsaws. Clover notes the revelation of Pamela Voorhees as the killer as \\"the most dramatic case of pulling out the gender rug\\" in horror film history. Commenting on the first- person point-of-view shots from the killer, Clover writes: \\"'We' [the audience] stalk and kill a number of teenagers over the course of an hour of movie time without even knowing who 'we' are; we are invited, by conventional expectation and by glimpses of 'our' own bodily partsa heavily booted foot, a roughly gloved handto suppose that 'we' are male, but 'we' are revealed, at the film's end, as a woman.\\" On the killer's identity, Dimare has noted: =Legacy= Crowds attending a revival of screening of the film in Blairstown, New Jersey, where it was filmed Cultural impact Contemporary scholars in film criticism, such as Tony Williams, have credited Friday the 13th for initiating the subgenre of the \\"stalker\\" or slasher film. Cultural critic Graham Thompson also considers the film as a template, along with John Carpenter's Halloween (1978), that \\"instigated a rush\\" of films of its type, in which young people away from supervision are systematically stalked and murdered by a masked villain. While critical reception of the film has been varied in the years since its release, it has attained a significant cult following. In 2017, Complex ranked the film ninth in a list of the best slasher films of all time. Film scholar Matt Hills wrote of the film's legacy: \\"Friday the 13th has not just been critically positioned as intellectually lacking, it has been othered and devalued in line with the conventional aesthetic norms of the academy and official film culture, said to lack originality and artfulness, to possess no nominated or recognized auteur, and to be grossly sensationalist in its focus on Tom Savini's gory special effects.\\" The film was nominated in 2001 for AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Thrills. In April 2018, Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco, where the film was shot, held \\"Crystal Lake Tours,\\" an event dedicated to the making of the film which brought attendees to nine of the filming locations on the property. The event was attended by actress Adrienne King, who recounted the making of the film to fans. Other media=Sequel and franchise= As of 2018, Friday the 13th has spawned ten sequels, including a crossover film with A Nightmare on Elm Street villain Freddy Krueger. Friday the 13th Part 2 (1981) introduced Jason Voorhees, the son of Mrs. Voorhees, as the primary antagonist, which would continue for the remaining sequels (with exception of the fifth movie) and related works. Most of the sequels were filmed on larger budgets than the original. For comparison, Friday the 13th had a budget of $550,000, while the first sequel was given a budget of $1.25 million. At the time of its release, Freddy vs. Jason had the largest budget, at $30 million. All of the sequels repeated the premise of the original, so the filmmakers made tweaks to provide freshness. Changes involved an addition to the title‚Äîas opposed to a number attached to the end‚Äîlike \\"The Final Chapter\\" and \\"Jason Takes Manhattan\\", or filming the movie in 3-D, as Miner did for Friday the 13th Part III (1982). One major addition that would affect the entire film series was the addition of Jason's hockey mask in the third film; this mask would become one of the most recognizable images in popular culture. A reboot to Friday the 13th was released theatrically in February 2009, with Freddy vs. Jason writers Damian Shannon and Mark Swift hired to script the new film. The film focused on Jason Voorhees, along with his trademark hockey mask. The film was produced by Michael Bay, Andrew Form and Brad Fuller through Bay's production company Platinum Dunes, for New Line Cinema. In November 2007, Marcus Nispel, director of the 2003 remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, was hired to direct. The film had its United States release on February 13, 2009. =Novelization= In 1987, seven years after the release of the motion picture, Simon Hawke produced a novelization of Friday the 13th. One of the few additions to the book was Mrs. Voorhees begging the Christy family to take her back after the loss of her son; they agreed. Another addition in the novel is more understanding in Mrs. Voorhees' actions. Hawke felt the character had attempted to move on when Jason died, but her psychosis got the best of her. When Steve Christy reopened the camp, Mrs. Voorhees saw it as a chance that what happened to her son could happen again. Her murders were against the counselors, because she saw them all as responsible for Jason's death. =Comic books= A number of scenes from the film were recreated in Friday the 13th: Pamela's Tale, a two-issue comic book prequel released by WildStorm in 2007. In 2016, the book On Location in Blairstown: The Making of Friday the 13th was released detailing the planning and filming of the movie. =Video Game= In 2007, Xendex released game-adaptation movie Friday the 13th for mobile phones. In the game, the player plays as Annie Phillips (but unlike in the film she doesn\`t die), one of the counselors at Camp Crystal Lake. While the staff is preparing the camp for its first summer weekend, an \\"unknown stalker\\" begins murdering each of them. The player must discover the truth and escape the camp alive.

He was the founding priest of the National Shrine of the Little Flower church. He was one of the first political leaders to use radio to reach a mass audience: during the 1930s, an estimated 30 million listeners tuned to his weekly broadcasts. Initially, Coughlin was a vocal supporter of Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal, but became a harsh critic of Roosevelt, accusing him of being too friendly to bankers. In 1934, he established a political organization called the National Union for Social Justice. Its platform called for monetary reforms, nationalization of major industries and railroads, and protection of labor rights. The membership ran into the millions, but it was not well organized locally. After hinting at attacks on Jewish bankers, Coughlin began to use his radio program to broadcast antisemitic commentary. In the late 1930s, he supported some of the fascist policies of Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, and Emperor Hirohito of Japan. The broadcasts have been described as \\"a variation of the Fascist agenda applied to American culture\\". His chief topics were political and economic rather than religious, using the slogan \\"Social Justice\\". After the outbreak of World War II in Europe in 1939, the Roosevelt administration finally forced the cancellation of his radio program and forbade distribution by mail of his newspaper, Social Justice. Early life and work Coughlin was born in Hamilton, Ontario, to Irish Catholic parents, Amelia (n√©e Mahoney) and Thomas J. Coughlin. After his basic education, he attended St. Michael's College in Toronto in 1911, run by the Congregation of St. Basil, a society of priests dedicated to education. After graduation, Coughlin entered the Basilian Fathers. He prepared for holy orders at St. Basil's Seminary, and was ordained to the priesthood in Toronto in 1916. He was assigned to teach at Assumption College, also operated by the Basilians, in Windsor, Ontario. In 1923, a reorganization of Coughlin's religious order resulted in his departure. The Holy See required the Basilians to change the congregational structure from a society of common life patterned after the Society of Priests of Saint Sulpice, to a more monastic life. They had to take the traditional three religious vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience. Coughlin could not accept this. Leaving the congregation, Coughlin moved across the Detroit River to the United States, settling in the booming industrial city of Detroit, Michigan, where the automotive industry was expanding rapidly. He was incardinated (or formally enrolled) by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit in 1923. After being transferred several times to different parishes, in 1926 he was assigned to the newly founded Shrine of the Little Flower, a congregation of some 25 Catholic families among the largely Protestant suburban community of Royal Oak, Michigan. His powerful preaching soon expanded the parish congregation. Radio broadcaster In 1926, Coughlin began broadcasting on radio station WJR, in response to cross burnings by the Ku Klux Klan on the grounds of his church. The KKK was near the peak of its membership and power in Detroit. This second manifestation of the KKK, which developed chapters in cities and towns throughout the North and West as well as in its Southern origins, was also strongly anti-Catholic and anti- immigrant. In response, Coughlin's weekly hour-long radio program denounced the KKK, appealing to his Irish Catholic audience. When WJR was acquired by Goodwill Stations in 1929, owner George A. Richards encouraged Coughlin to focus on politics instead of religious topics. Becoming increasingly vehement, the broadcasts attacked the banking system and Jews. Coughlin's program was picked up by CBS in 1930 for national broadcast. The tower where he would broadcast his radio sermons from was completed in 1931. A number of studies of early broadcasting, and of Coughlin in particular,Michael Casey and Aimee Rowe. \\"'Driving Out the Money Changers': Radio Priest Charles E. Coughlin's Rhetorical Vision.\\" Journal of Communication & Religion 19.1 (1996).Ronald H. Carpenter, \\"Father Charles E. Coughlin, Style in Discourse and Opinion Leadership,\\" in Thomas W. Benson, ed., American Rhetoric in the New Deal Era, 1932-1945 (Michigan State University Press, 2006) pp 315-67. have drawn parallels between the \\"radio priest's\\" strident attacks on his opponents and the style and content of much of late 20th-century talk radio.Jack Kay, George W. Ziegelmueller, and Kevin M. Minch. \\"From Coughlin to contemporary talk radio: Fallacies & propaganda in American populist radio,\\" Journal of Radio Studies 5.1 (1998): 9-21. Political views In January 1930, Coughlin began a series of attacks against socialism and Soviet Communism, which was strongly opposed by the Catholic Church. He criticized capitalists in America whose greed had made communist ideologies attractive. He warned: \\"Let not the workingman be able to say that he is driven into the ranks of socialism by the inordinate and grasping greed of the manufacturer.\\" Radio League of the Little Flower membership application card. In 1931, the CBS radio network dropped Coughlin's program when he refused to accept network demands to review his scripts prior to broadcast. He raised independent money to fund his own national network, which soon reached millions of listeners through a 36-station syndicate originating from flagship station WJR, for the Golden Hour of the Shrine of the Little Flower, as the program was called. Throughout the 1930s, Coughlin's views changed significantly. Eventually he was \\"openly antidemocratic,\\" according to Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt, \\"calling for the abolition of political parties and questioning the value of elections.\\" =Support for FDR= Against the deepening crisis of the Great Depression, Coughlin strongly endorsed Franklin D. Roosevelt during the 1932 Presidential election. He was an early supporter of Roosevelt's New Deal reforms and coined the phrase \\"Roosevelt or Ruin\\" which entered common usage during the early days of the first FDR administration. Another phrase he became known for was \\"The New Deal is Christ's Deal.\\" In January 1934, Coughlin testified before Congress in support of FDR's policies, saying, \\"If Congress fails to back up the President in his monetary program, I predict a revolution in this country which will make the French Revolution look silly!\\" He also said to the Congressional hearing, \\"God is directing President Roosevelt.\\" =Opposition to FDR= Though politely received, President Roosevelt had little interest in enacting Coughlin's economic proposals. Coughlin's support for Roosevelt and his New Deal faded in 1934 when he founded the National Union for Social Justice (NUSJ), a nationalistic workers' rights organization. Its leaders grew impatient with what they considered the President's unconstitutional and pseudo-capitalistic monetary policies. Coughlin preached increasingly about the negative influence of \\"money changers\\" and \\"permitting a group of private citizens to create money\\" at the expense of the general welfare. He spoke of the need for monetary reform based on \\"free silver.\\" Coughlin claimed that the Great Depression in the United States was a \\"cash famine\\" and proposed monetary reforms, including the nationalization of the Federal Reserve System, as the solution. =Economic policies= Coughlin urged Roosevelt to use silver to increase the money supply and also reorganize the financial system. These and other such ideas did not find a receptive audience. However, investment in silver was increased for a limited period following the Silver Purchase Act of 1934, which resulted in U.S. silver mines being nationalized between 1934 and 1943 through stamp taxes.https://www.mysticstamp.com/info/this-day-in-history- june-19-1934/#:~:text=To%20help%20stabilize%20its%20value,stored%20or%20made%20into%20coins. Among NUSJ's articles of faith were work and income guarantees, nationalizing vital industry, wealth redistribution through taxation of the wealthy, federal protection of workers' unions, and limiting property rights in favor of government control of the country's assets for public good.\\"Principles of the National Union for Social Justice\\", quoted in . Illustrative of Coughlin's disdain for free-market capitalism is his statement: =Radio audience= By 1934, Coughlin was perhaps the most prominent Roman Catholic speaker on political and financial issues with a radio audience that reached tens of millions of people every week. Alan Brinkley wrote that \\"by 1934, he was receiving more than 10,000 letters every day\\" and that \\"his clerical staff at times numbered more than a hundred.\\" He foreshadowed modern talk radio and televangelism. However, the University of Detroit Mercy claims that Coughlin's peak audience was in 1932.https://libraries.udmercy.edu/archives/special- collections/index.php?collectionSet=community&collectionCode;=coughlin_cou&page;=2 In 1934, when Coughlin began criticizing the New Deal, Roosevelt sent Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. and Frank Murphy, both prominent Irish Catholics, to try to influence him. Kennedy was reported to be a friend of Coughlin. Coughlin periodically visited Roosevelt while accompanied by Kennedy. In an August 16, 1936 Boston Post article, Coughlin referred to Kennedy as the \\"shining star among the dim 'knights' in the [Roosevelt] Administration.\\" Increasingly opposed to Roosevelt, Coughlin began denouncing the President as a tool of Wall Street. The priest supported populist Huey Long as governor of Louisiana until Long was assassinated in 1935. He supported William Lemke's Union Party in 1936. Coughlin opposed the New Deal with growing vehemence. His radio talks attacked Roosevelt, capitalists, and alleged the existence of Jewish conspirators. Another nationally known priest, Monsignor John A. Ryan, initially supported Coughlin, but opposed him after Coughlin turned on Roosevelt. Joseph Kennedy, who strongly supported the New Deal, warned as early as 1933 that Coughlin was \\"becoming a very dangerous proposition\\" as an opponent of Roosevelt and \\"an out and out demagogue.\\" Kennedy worked with Roosevelt, Bishop Francis Spellman, and Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli (the future Pope Pius XII) in a successful effort to get the Vatican to silence Coughlin in 1936. In 1940‚Äì41, reversing his own views, Kennedy attacked the isolationism of Coughlin. In 1935, Coughlin proclaimed, \\"I have dedicated my life to fight against the heinous rottenness of modern capitalism because it robs the laborer of this world's goods. But blow for blow I shall strike against Communism, because it robs us of the next world's happiness.\\" He accused Roosevelt of \\"leaning toward international socialism on the Spanish question.\\" Coughlin's NUSJ gained a strong following among nativists and opponents of the Federal Reserve, especially in the Midwest. Michael Kazin has written that Coughlinites saw Wall Street and Communism as twin faces of a secular Satan. They believed that they were defending those people who were joined more by piety, economic frustration, and a common dread of powerful, modernizing enemies than through any class identity. One of Coughlin's campaign slogans was: \\"Less care for internationalism and more concern for national prosperity,\\" which appealed to the 1930s isolationists in the United States. Coughlin's organization especially appealed to Irish Catholics. Anti-Semitism Jewish TV producer Norman Lear has stated that he heard Coughlin make anti-Semitic remarks when he came across a radio sermon in 1931 and heard more anti-semitic sermons he examined over time as well.https://www.npr.org/transcripts/155521188https://www.npr.org/2016/07/07/484940550/a-television- giant-comes-into-focushttps://www.questia.com/magazine/1P4-2299762624/for-the- american-wayhttps://variety.com/2019/tv/news/norman-lear-people-for-the- american- way-1203337825/https://jewishjournal.com/commentary/opinion/rob_eshman/151495/ Some of these sermons also promoted anti-semitism by criticizing people who Jews considered to be \\"great heroes,\\" such as President Franklin Roosevelt. After the 1936 election, Coughlin expressed overt sympathy for the fascist governments of Hitler and Mussolini as an antidote to Communism. According to him, Jewish bankers were behind the Russian Revolution; he backed the Jewish Bolshevism conspiracy theory. Coughlin's Social Justice magazine on sale in New York City, 1939 Coughlin promoted his controversial beliefs by means of his radio broadcasts and his weekly rotogravure magazine, Social Justice, which began publication in March 1936. During the last half of 1938, Social Justice reprinted weekly installments of the fraudulent, antisemitic text The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. The Protocols is a Russian forgery that purports to expose a Jewish conspiracy to seize control of the world. On various occasions, Coughlin denied that he was antisemitic. In February 1939, when the American Nazi organization the German American Bund held a large rally in New York City, Coughlin immediately distanced himself from the organization, and in his weekly radio address, he said: \\"Nothing can be gained by linking ourselves with any organization which is engaged in agitating racial animosities or propagating racial hatreds. Organizations which stand upon such platforms are immoral and their policies are only negative.\\" In August of that same year, in an interview with Edward Doherty of the weekly magazine Liberty, Coughlin said: On November 20, 1938, two weeks after Kristallnacht (the Nazi attack on German and Austrian Jews, their synagogues, and businesses), Coughlin, referring to the millions of Christians who had been killed by the Communists in Russia, said, \\"Jewish persecution only followed after Christians first were persecuted.\\" After this speech, some radio stations, including those in New York City and Chicago, began refusing to air Coughlin's speeches without subjecting his scripts to prior review and approval. In New York City, his programs were cancelled by WINS and WMCA, and in New Jersey, Coughlin's programs were only broadcast on the part-time Newark station WHBI. On December 18, 1938, thousands of Coughlin's followers picketed the studios of station WMCA in New York City to protest the station's refusal to carry the priest's broadcasts. A number of protesters yelled anti-semitic statements, such as \\"Send Jews back where they came from in leaky boats!\\" and \\"Wait until Hitler comes over here!\\" The protests continued for several months. Historian Donald Warren, using information from the FBI and German government archives, has documented that Coughlin received indirect funding from Nazi Germany during this period. After 1936, Coughlin began supporting an organization called the Christian Front, which claimed that he was an inspiration. In January 1940, a New York City unit of the Christian Front was raided by the FBI for plotting to overthrow the government. Coughlin had never been a member of it. In March 1940, The Radio League of the Little Flower, the creators of the Social Justice magazine, self-published a book titled An Answer to Father Coughlin's Critics. Written by \\"Father Coughlin's Friends,\\" the book was an attempt to \\"deal with those matters which relate directly to the main charges registered against Father Coughlin‚Ä¶ to his being a pro-Nazi, anti-Semite, a falsifier of documents, etc.\\" (preface). Cancellation of his radio show At its peak in the early-to-mid 1930s, Coughlin's radio show was phenomenally popular. His office received up to 80,000 letters per week from listeners. Author Sheldon Marcus said that the size of Coughlin's radio audience \\"is impossible to determine, but estimates range up to 30 million each week.\\" He expressed an isolationist, and conspiratorial, viewpoint that resonated with many listeners. Some members of the Catholic hierarchy may not have approved of Coughlin. The Vatican, the Apostolic Nunciature to the United States, and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati all wanted him to be silenced. They recognized that only Coughlin's superior, Bishop Michael Gallagher of Detroit, had the canonical authority to curb him, but Gallagher supported the \\"Radio Priest\\". Owing to Gallagher's autonomy, and the prospect of the Coughlin problem leading to a schism, the Roman Catholic leadership took no action. Coughlin increasingly attacked the president's policies. The administration decided that, although the First Amendment protected free speech, it did not necessarily apply to broadcasting, because the radio spectrum was a \\"limited national resource,\\" and as a result, it was regulated as a publicly owned commons. The authorities imposed new regulations and restrictions for the specific purpose of forcing Coughlin off the air. For the first time, the authorities required regular radio broadcasters to seek operating permits. When Coughlin's permit was denied, he was temporarily silenced. Coughlin worked around the new restrictions by purchasing air-time, and playing his speeches via transcription. However, having to buy the weekly air-time on individual stations seriously reduced his reach, and it also strained his financial resources. Meanwhile, Bishop Gallagher died, and he was replaced by a prelate who was less sympathetic to Coughlin than Bishop Gallagher had been, Edward Aloysius Mooney. In 1939, the Institute for Propaganda Analysis used Coughlin's radio talks to illustrate propaganda methods in their book The Fine Art of Propaganda, which was intended to show propaganda's effects against democracy. After the outbreak of World War II in Europe in September 1939, Coughlin's opposition to the repeal of a neutrality- oriented arms embargo law resulted in additional and more successful efforts to force him off the air. According to Marcus, in October 1939, one month after the invasion of Poland, \\"the Code Committee of the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) adopted new rules which placed rigid limitations on the sale of radio time to 'spokesmen of controversial public issues'.\\" Manuscripts were required to be submitted in advance. Radio stations were threatened with the loss of their licenses if they failed to comply. This ruling was clearly aimed at Coughlin, owing to his opposition to prospective American involvement in World War II. In the September 23, 1940, issue of Social Justice, Coughlin announced that he had been forced off the air \\"by those who control circumstances beyond my reach.\\" Coughlin said that, although the government had assumed the right to regulate any on-air broadcasts, the First Amendment still guaranteed and protected freedom of the written press. He could still print his editorials without censorship in his own newspaper, Social Justice. After the devastating Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and the U.S. declaration of war in December 1941, anti-interventionist movements (such as the America First Committee) rapidly lost support. Isolationists such as Coughlin acquired a reputation for sympathizing with the enemy. The Roosevelt Administration stepped in again. On April 14, 1942, U.S. Attorney General Francis Biddle wrote a letter to the Postmaster General, Frank Walker, in which he suggested that the second-class mailing privilege of Social Justice be revoked, in order to make it impossible for Coughlin to deliver the papers to its readers. Walker scheduled a hearing for April 29, which was postponed until May 4. Meanwhile, Biddle was also exploring the possibility of bringing an indictment against Coughlin for sedition as a possible \\"last resort\\". Hoping to avoid such a potentially sensational and divisive sedition trial, Biddle arranged to end the publication of Social Justice itself. First Biddle had a meeting with banker Leo Crowley, another Roosevelt political appointee and a friend of Bishop Edward Aloysius Mooney of Detroit, Bishop Gallagher's successor. Crowley relayed Biddle's message to Mooney that the government was willing to \\"deal with Coughlin in a restrained manner if he [Mooney] would order Coughlin to cease his public activities.\\" Consequently, on May 1, Bishop Mooney ordered that Coughlin should stop his political activities and confine himself to his duties as a parish priest, warning him that his priestly faculties could potentially be removed if he refused to comply with the order. Coughlin complied with the order and was allowed to remain the pastor of the Shrine of the Little Flower. The pending hearing before the Postmaster General, which had been scheduled to take place three days later, was cancelled. Although he had been forced to end his public career in 1942, Coughlin served as a parish pastor until his retirement in 1966.  Death  Coughlin died in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, in 1979 at the age of 88. Church officials stated that he had been bedridden for several weeks. He was buried in the Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Southfield, Michigan.

Prorail is a part of NS Railinfratrust, the Dutch railway infrastructure owner. It consists of the following infrastructure management organisations: *Railinfrabeheer (Rail Infrastructure Management, RIB) *Railned (railway capacity allocation - long-term planning, more than 52 hours before the day of the train service) *Railverkeersleiding (traffic control - short-term planning, less than 52 hours before the day of the train service) The rail capacity supplied by ProRail is used by several public transport operators: * Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS), the passenger train operating company on main lines, * Smaller passenger operators, including Qbuzz, Arriva, Keolis Nederland, and Connexxion/Breng, * DB Regionalbahn Westfalen, which mainly operates in Germany * Cargo operatorsm including DB Cargo, Rotterdam Rail Feeding, and Lineas. * Smaller freight operators, including: Rail4Chem (now owned by Veolia), Veolia Cargo, ERS Railways, Bentheimer Eisenbahn, HGK, Portfeeders (part of ACTS), and SNCF Fret Its Utrecht headquarters is in the former offices of Nederlandse Spoorwegen (known as De Inktpot, \\"The Inkwell\\"), the largest brick building in the Netherlands. The building currently features a \\"UFO\\" on its facade resulting from an art program in 2000.  Funding  Funding for ProRail is provided by a government subsidy, and a fee paid by the railway operators (called infraheffing). The government subsidy totalled around ‚Ç¨2.5 billion from 2014‚Äì2017, and the infraheffing totalled approx. ‚Ç¨200 million in 2006, the remaining income was listed as 'other'. The fee that the public transport operators have to pay for this is lower than the cost, but increasing. In 2003 it was ‚Ç¨0.64 per train km and ‚Ç¨0.54 to ‚Ç¨2.16 for stopping at a station.  Performance oriented maintenance  Railways in the Netherlands are not maintained by ProRail itself. Instead, it is subcontracted to recognised maintenance contractors. The Dutch railway network is subdivided into 21 areas.https://maps.prorail.nl/portal/sharing/rest/content/items/1fbce2d13ee2468582ea76a2606fdae3/data For each area, all of the regular maintenance is contracted as one package, which is won by the contractor that submits the best offer. The contractor receives a fixed sum per month, and is fined in case of failure to meet the required performance. Contractors are incentivised to minimise cost, while ensuring good performance of the assets. This is called prestatiegericht onderhoud (performance oriented maintenance).

Framebuffer with memory controllers had been in common use for years at the time of this 1979 patent filing. * a calligraphic display \\"Arrangement for producing a pattern on a light-sensitive surface\\"  STDMA  H√•kan Lans is the designer of a tracking system which makes use of a Self-Organized Time Division Multiple Access (STDMA) datalink. The STDMA datalink is currently in use in Automatic Identification System (AIS). AIS is a short range coastal tracking system which is mandatory aboard international voyaging ships with gross tonnage (GT) of 300 or more tons, and all passenger ships regardless of size. STDMA is also in use as one of the three physical layer models proposed for Automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), a cooperative surveillance technique for air traffic control which is in the process of implementation. Lans has his own company, GP&C; Systems International AB, which is focused on marketing STDMA.  Legal disputes  Concerning the patent on the framebuffer controller, in 1997 Lans as an individual sued several companies, including Compaq, Gateway and Hewlett Packard, for not paying royalties, and allegedly infringing on his patent. The defendants counterclaimed that the patent was assigned to Uniboard AB, a company wholly owned by Lans. The judge ruled that this was the case and thus Lans lost the case. This has led to a dispute between Lans and his attorneys, who Lans has sued for misconduct. This suit was settled in April 2012. An allegation was presented on Swedish National Television that an attorney's conduct was due to alleged connections with The Pentagon, in order to stop Lans' progress on his STDMA patent.Sveriges Television , Uppdrag Granskning.

She is most commonly referred to simply as \\"Trillian\\", a modification of her birth name, which she adopted because it sounded more \\"space-like\\". According to the movie version, her middle name is Marie. Physically, she is described as \\"a slim, darkish humanoid, with long waves of black hair, a full mouth, an odd little knob of a nose and ridiculously brown eyes,\\" looking \\"vaguely Arabic.\\". p. 31. Biography Tricia McMillan is a mathematician and astrophysicist whom Arthur Dent attempted to talk to at a party in Islington. She and Arthur next meet six months later on the spaceship Heart of Gold, shortly after the Earth has been destroyed to make way for a hyperspace bypass. The trilogy later reveals that Trillian eventually left the party with Zaphod Beeblebrox, who, according to the Quintessential Phase, is directly responsible for her nickname. In the radio series, she is carried off and forcibly married to the President of the Algolian Chapter of the Galactic Rotary Club, and consequently does not appear in the second radio series at all. The later radio series (the Tertiary Phase and beyond) reveal this (probably) occurred only in the artificial universe within the Guide offices. In the books, which the third, fourth and fifth series follow, she saves the universe from the Krikketers, and later becomes a Sub-Etha Radio reporter under the name Trillian Astra. Some drafts of the movie's screenplay, and Robbie Stamp's \\"making of\\" book covering the movie, state that Trillian was to be revealed as half-human, an acknowledged divergence from Douglas Adams' original storyline. This would have been done in order to underline the loneliness of Arthur Dent, the only 100% Homo sapiens remaining in the universe, after Earth's demolition. This idea was scrapped after the \\"making of\\" book was written, and the scene revealing Trillian's heritage (by the mice, to Arthur, on the Earth Mark II) was re-written. An interview with actress Zooey Deschanel, included on the DVD version, has her mention that Trillian is half-human, suggesting the interview was recorded prior to the change of plan. Relationships In the novels and radio series, Trillian does not have a romantic relationship with Arthur (although when Arthur starts seeing Fenchurch, Ford Prefect asks him what happened to Trillian). In the fifth book, Trillian is revealed as the mother of Random Dent. It is unclear for how long (if ever) Trillian had a relationship with Zaphod. They seem to travel away from each other after the third book, although in the fourth one Arthur states Trillian is with Zaphod, and in the fifth Trillian implies that she hadn't had a child with Zaphod simply because they're different species. In the sixth novel, And Another Thing..., she pursues a relationship with Wowbagger, the Infinitely Prolonged; she accuses Arthur of carrying a torch for her as well. The 2005 film puts a different spin on the character. The main emotional arc of the movie is a love triangle between Trillian, Zaphod, and Arthur. Trillian is initially attracted to Arthur when she meets him on Earth, but she's disappointed by his apparent lack of spontaneity. During their travels, Trillian discovers that Zaphod may be the more superficially exciting choice, but Arthur is the man who truly cares about her, Arthur commenting when he is about to have his head cut open by the mice that his feelings for Trillian are the only thing that he ever had questions about where the answer made him happy. The film concludes with Arthur and Trillian sharing a brief kiss as they prepare to return to the Heart of Gold with Ford and Zaphod as Slartibartfast plans to restart Earth, Arthur concluding that he is ready to move on from the planet now that there is a world to come back to. Portrayals Trillian was played on radio by Susan Sheridan, on television by Sandra Dickinson (who also reprised an alternate-universe version of the role in the fifth and sixth radio series, playing both original and alternate-universe versions in the latter), on the Original Records LP version by Cindy Oswin, and in the 2005 film by Zooey Deschanel. In The Illustrated Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, she is portrayed by Tali, a model. In the original radio series, she is portrayed with an English accent - in both the TV series and movie she is played as an American. The \\"Quintessential Phase\\" of the radio series features Sandra Dickinson in the role of the alternate version of Tricia McMillan as a \\"blonder and more American\\" Trillian - the radio series indicates that the character is otherwise identical to the first Trillian and was born in the United Kingdom. In the book Mostly Harmless, it is said that both the alternate Tricia McMillan and Trillian have an English accent. In The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy novel, she is described as follows: \\"She was slim, darkish, humanoid, with long waves of black hair, a full mouth, an odd little knob of a nose and ridiculously brown eyes. With her red head scarf knotted in that particular way and her long flowing silky brown dress, she looked vaguely Arabic.\\" She has consistently not been portrayed as such in the television and film adaptions, although the film adaptation Trillian is closer to her appearance in the books than it was in the television series.

The entire globular granule may contain around 30,000 glucose units. A view of the atomic structure of a single branched strand of glucose units in a glycogen molecule. Glycogen (black granules) in spermatozoa of a flatworm; transmission electron microscopy, scale: 0.3 ¬µm Glycogen is a multibranched polysaccharide of glucose that serves as a form of energy storage in animals, fungi, and bacteria. The polysaccharide structure represents the main storage form of glucose in the body. Glycogen functions as one of two forms of energy reserves, glycogen being for short-term and the other form being triglyceride stores in adipose tissue (i.e., body fat) for long-term storage. In humans, glycogen is made and stored primarily in the cells of the liver and skeletal muscle. In the liver, glycogen can make up 5‚Äì6% of the organ's fresh weight, and the liver of an adult weighing 1.5 kg can store roughly 100‚Äì120 grams of glycogen. In skeletal muscle, glycogen is found in a low concentration (1‚Äì2% of the muscle mass) and the skeletal muscle of an adult weighing 70 kg stores roughly 400 grams of glycogen. The amount of glycogen stored in the body‚Äîparticularly within the muscles and liver‚Äîmostly depends on physical training, basal metabolic rate, and eating habits. Small amounts of glycogen are also found in other tissues and cells, including the kidneys, red blood cells, white blood cells, and glial cells in the brain. The uterus also stores glycogen during pregnancy to nourish the embryo. Approximately 4 grams of glucose are present in the blood of humans at all times; in fasted individuals, blood glucose is maintained constant at this level at the expense of glycogen stores in the liver and skeletal muscle. Glycogen stores in skeletal muscle serve as a form of energy storage for the muscle itself; however, the breakdown of muscle glycogen impedes muscle glucose uptake from the blood, thereby increasing the amount of blood glucose available for use in other tissues. Liver glycogen stores serve as a store of glucose for use throughout the body, particularly the central nervous system. The human brain consumes approximately 60% of blood glucose in fasted, sedentary individuals. Glycogen is the analogue of starch, a glucose polymer that functions as energy storage in plants. It has a structure similar to amylopectin (a component of starch), but is more extensively branched and compact than starch. Both are white powders in their dry state. Glycogen is found in the form of granules in the cytosol/cytoplasm in many cell types, and plays an important role in the glucose cycle. Glycogen forms an energy reserve that can be quickly mobilized to meet a sudden need for glucose, but one that is less compact than the energy reserves of triglycerides (lipids). As such it is also found as storage reserve in many parasitic protozoa. Structure 1,4-Œ±-glycosidic linkages in the glycogen oligomer 1,4-Œ±-glycosidic and 1,6-glycosidic linkages in the glycogen oligomer Glycogen is a branched biopolymer consisting of linear chains of glucose residues with an average chain length of approximately 8‚Äì12 glucose units and 2,000-60,000 residues per one molecule of glycogen Glucose units are linked together linearly by Œ±(1‚Üí4) glycosidic bonds from one glucose to the next. Branches are linked to the chains from which they are branching off by Œ±(1‚Üí6) glycosidic bonds between the first glucose of the new branch and a glucose on the stem chain. Due to the way glycogen is synthesised, every glycogen granule has at its core a glycogenin protein. Glycogen in muscle, liver, and fat cells is stored in a hydrated form, composed of three or four parts of water per part of glycogen associated with 0.45 millimoles (18 mg) of potassium per gram of glycogen. Glucose is an osmotic molecule, and can have profound effects on osmotic pressure in high concentrations possibly leading to cell damage or death if stored in the cell without being modified. Glycogen is a non-osmotic molecule, so it can be used as a solution to storing glucose in the cell without disrupting osmotic pressure. Functions=Liver= As a meal containing carbohydrates or protein is eaten and digested, blood glucose levels rise, and the pancreas secretes insulin. Blood glucose from the portal vein enters liver cells (hepatocytes). Insulin acts on the hepatocytes to stimulate the action of several enzymes, including glycogen synthase. Glucose molecules are added to the chains of glycogen as long as both insulin and glucose remain plentiful. In this postprandial or \\"fed\\" state, the liver takes in more glucose from the blood than it releases. After a meal has been digested and glucose levels begin to fall, insulin secretion is reduced, and glycogen synthesis stops. When it is needed for energy, glycogen is broken down and converted again to glucose. Glycogen phosphorylase is the primary enzyme of glycogen breakdown. For the next 8‚Äì12 hours, glucose derived from liver glycogen is the primary source of blood glucose used by the rest of the body for fuel. Glucagon, another hormone produced by the pancreas, in many respects serves as a countersignal to insulin. In response to insulin levels being below normal (when blood levels of glucose begin to fall below the normal range), glucagon is secreted in increasing amounts and stimulates both glycogenolysis (the breakdown of glycogen) and gluconeogenesis (the production of glucose from other sources). =Muscle= Muscle cell glycogen appears to function as an immediate reserve source of available glucose for muscle cells. Other cells that contain small amounts use it locally, as well. As muscle cells lack glucose-6-phosphatase, which is required to pass glucose into the blood, the glycogen they store is available solely for internal use and is not shared with other cells. This is in contrast to liver cells, which, on demand, readily do break down their stored glycogen into glucose and send it through the blood stream as fuel for other organs. History Glycogen was discovered by Claude Bernard. His experiments showed that the liver contained a substance that could give rise to reducing sugar by the action of a \\"ferment\\" in the liver. By 1857, he described the isolation of a substance he called \\"la mati√®re glycog√®ne\\", or \\"sugar-forming substance\\". Soon after the discovery of glycogen in the liver, A. Sanson found that muscular tissue also contains glycogen. The empirical formula for glycogen of ()n was established by Kekul√© in 1858. Metabolism=Synthesis= Glycogen synthesis is, unlike its breakdown, endergonic‚Äîit requires the input of energy. Energy for glycogen synthesis comes from uridine triphosphate (UTP), which reacts with glucose-1-phosphate, forming UDP-glucose, in a reaction catalysed by UTP‚Äîglucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase. Glycogen is synthesized from monomers of UDP-glucose initially by the protein glycogenin, which has two tyrosine anchors for the reducing end of glycogen, since glycogenin is a homodimer. After about eight glucose molecules have been added to a tyrosine residue, the enzyme glycogen synthase progressively lengthens the glycogen chain using UDP-glucose, adding Œ±(1‚Üí4)-bonded glucose to the reducing end of the glycogen chain.Nelson, D. (2013) Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry, 6th ed., W.H. Freeman and Company (p. 618) The glycogen branching enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a terminal fragment of six or seven glucose residues from a nonreducing end to the C-6 hydroxyl group of a glucose residue deeper into the interior of the glycogen molecule. The branching enzyme can act upon only a branch having at least 11 residues, and the enzyme may transfer to the same glucose chain or adjacent glucose chains. =Breakdown= Glycogen is cleaved from the nonreducing ends of the chain by the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase to produce monomers of glucose-1-phosphate: Action of Glycogen Phosphorylase on Glycogen In vivo, phosphorolysis proceeds in the direction of glycogen breakdown because the ratio of phosphate and glucose-1-phosphate is usually greater than 100.Stryer, L. (1988) Biochemistry, 3rd ed., Freeman (p. 451) Glucose-1-phosphate is then converted to glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) by phosphoglucomutase. A special debranching enzyme is needed to remove the Œ±(1-6) branches in branched glycogen and reshape the chain into a linear polymer. The G6P monomers produced have three possible fates: * G6P can continue on the glycolysis pathway and be used as fuel. * G6P can enter the pentose phosphate pathway via the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase to produce NADPH and 5-carbon sugars. * In the liver and kidney, G6P can be dephosphorylated back to glucose by the enzyme glucose 6-phosphatase. This is the final step in the gluconeogenesis pathway. Clinical relevance=Disorders of glycogen metabolism= The most common disease in which glycogen metabolism becomes abnormal is diabetes, in which, because of abnormal amounts of insulin, liver glycogen can be abnormally accumulated or depleted. Restoration of normal glucose metabolism usually normalizes glycogen metabolism, as well. In hypoglycemia caused by excessive insulin, liver glycogen levels are high, but the high insulin levels prevent the glycogenolysis necessary to maintain normal blood sugar levels. Glucagon is a common treatment for this type of hypoglycemia. Various inborn errors of metabolism are caused by deficiencies of enzymes necessary for glycogen synthesis or breakdown. These are collectively referred to as glycogen storage diseases. =Glycogen depletion and endurance exercise= Long-distance athletes, such as marathon runners, cross-country skiers, and cyclists, often experience glycogen depletion, where almost all of the athlete's glycogen stores are depleted after long periods of exertion without sufficient carbohydrate consumption. This phenomenon is referred to as \\"hitting the wall\\". Glycogen depletion can be forestalled in three possible ways. First, during exercise, carbohydrates with the highest possible rate of conversion to blood glucose (high glycemic index) are ingested continuously. The best possible outcome of this strategy replaces about 35% of glucose consumed at heart rates above about 80% of maximum. Second, through endurance training adaptations and specialized regimens (e.g. fasting low-intensity endurance training), the body can condition type I muscle fibers to improve both fuel use efficiency and workload capacity to increase the percentage of fatty acids used as fuel, sparing carbohydrate use from all sources. Third, by consuming large quantities of carbohydrates after depleting glycogen stores as a result of exercise or diet, the body can increase storage capacity of intramuscular glycogen stores.McDonald, Lyle. The Ketogenic Diet: A Complete Guide for the Dieter and the Practitioner. Lyle McDonald, 1998 This process is known as carbohydrate loading. In general, glycemic index of carbohydrate source does not matter since muscular insulin sensitivity is increased as a result of temporary glycogen depletion.McDonald, Lyle. The Ultimate Diet 2.0. Lyle McDonald, 2003 When experiencing glycogen debt, athletes often experience extreme fatigue to the point that it is difficult to move. As a reference, the very best professional cyclists in the world will usually finish a 4- to 5-hr stage race right at the limit of glycogen depletion using the first three strategies. When athletes ingest both carbohydrate and caffeine following exhaustive exercise, their glycogen stores tend to be replenished more rapidly; however, the minimum dose of caffeine at which there is a clinically significant effect on glycogen repletion has not been established.

It is related to the Ford Prefect and the later Ford Popular. The Anglia name was applied to various models between 1939 and 1967. A total of 1,594,486 Anglias were produced. It was replaced by the Ford Escort. Anglia E04A (1939‚Äì48) The first Ford Anglia model, the E04A, was released on 31 October 1939 as smallest model in the UK Ford range. It replaced the Ford 7Y and was a facelifted version of that model. The Anglia was a simple vehicle aimed at the cheap end of the market, with few features. Most were painted Ford black. Styling was typically late-1930s, with an upright radiator. There were standard and deluxe models, the latter having better instrumentation and, on pre-war models, running boards. Both front and rear suspensions used transverse leaf springs, and the brakes were mechanical. The two-door Anglia is similar to the longer, four-door, E93A Ford Prefect. A bulge at the back enabled a spare wheel to be removed from its vertical outside stowage on the back of the car and stowed flat on the boot floor, which usefully increased luggage space. Some back seat leg room was sacrificed to the luggage space, being reduced from 43¬æ inches in the Ford 7Y to 38¬Ω inches in the Anglia. The Anglia replaced the 7Y saloon, but the van version of the earlier model continued to be built until 1946, after which some very minor changes sufficed to rebaptize the van the \\"E04C\\".Ballard, p. 48 The domestic market engine was the straight-four side-valve engine familiar to drivers of predecessor models since 1933. The 1172 cc straight-four engine from the Ford Ten was fitted for some export markets, including North America, where imports began for model year 1948; these cars used the slightly more aerodynamic \\"three-hole\\" grille from the 1937-38 Ford Ten 7W, prefacing the 1949 E494A facelift. They also had sealed beam headlights and small, separate parking lights mounted underneath, as well as dual tail lights, into which flashing turn signals could be added without adding additional lights. A minor styling change was made in December 1947, with the name \\"Anglia\\" now incorporated in the top of the grille surround. The car retained a vacuum-powered wiper with its tendency to slow down or stop above about 40 mph (64 km/h), the point at which the suction effect from the induction manifold disappeared; however, the Anglia's wipers were supported by a vacuum reservoir, which partially addressed the propensity to stop entirely when the car was accelerated. A contemporary road test commended the Anglia's ability to pull away from 5 or 6 mph (8 or 10 km/h) in top gear. Compulsory driving tests had only recently been introduced in the UK. Most potential buyers would approach the vehicle without the benefit of formal driving tuition. The cars did have synchromesh between second and top gears, but not between first and second, so many would have sought, wherever possible, to avoid en route changes down to first. Production, hindered by the diversion of Ford's factory to military production during the Second World War, ceased in 1948 after 55,807 had been built. Initial sales in Britain actually began in early 1940. Production was suspended in early 1942, and resumed in mid-1945. The E04A was also built in Australia from 1940 to 1945 and was produced in tourer and roadster body styles. The former had a rear seat and the latter was a two-seater convertible. Anglia A54A (Australia: 1946‚Äì48) The Australian-built Anglia A54A used the chassis and front panels of the British E04A and was offered in 4-door sedan, tourer, coupe utility and panel van body styles. The 8HP 933cc engine was used and all models featured running boards. Three different types of radiator grille were fitted to A54A models. Both the original and the revised E04A grilles were used and a third style, unique to the A54A, was introduced in 1948. This featured a centrally placed vertical chrome strip.

Again it was a very spartan vehicle and in 1948 was Britain's lowest-priced four-wheel car. The 10HP, 1172 cc engine was again available in export markets - this model is called the E493OA.Ballard, p. 64 An Anglia tested by the British magazine The Motor in 1948 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 38.3 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost ¬£309 including taxes. Including all production, 108,878 were built. When production as an Anglia ceased in October 1953, it continued as the extremely basic Ford Popular until 1959. Rear Delivery vans based on the Anglia supported British commerce for several decades. These \\"commercial\\" versions often retained the mechanical components and front sections of superseded Anglia saloons. Anglia A494A (Australia: 1949‚Äì53) The Australian built A494A Anglias of the 1949 to 1953 period shared the frontal styling and 90 inch wheelbase chassis of their British E494A counterparts but differed in many other ways, notably in the range of body styles offered. A494As were produced in 4-door saloon, 2-door tourer, 2-door coupe utility and 2-door roadster utility models. All body styles had running boards, and the boot of the Australian saloon was less prominent than that of the British saloon. The 933-cc, 8 HP unit was initially the only engine offered, but the 1172-cc, 10 HP engine was available from 1950. At the time of its introduction, the A494A Tourer was the cheapest new car on the Australian market.

It was a completely new car, its style following the example of the larger Ford Consul introduced two years earlier and of its German counterpart, the Ford Taunus P1, by featuring a modern three-box design. The 100E was available as a two-door Anglia and a four-door Prefect. During this period, the old Anglia was available as the 103E Popular, touted as the cheapest car in the world. Internally there were individual front seats trimmed in PVC, hinged to allow access to the rear. The instruments (speedometer, fuel gauge and ammeter) were placed in a cluster around the steering column and the gear change was floor mounted. A heater and radio were optional extras. The dashboard was revised twice; the binnacle surrounding the steering column was replaced by a central panel with twin dials towards the driver's side in 1956; the last from 1959 had twin dials in a binnacle in front of the driver and 'magic ribbon' AC speedo similar to the 1957 E-series Vauxhall Velox/Cresta and '58/'59 PA models, and included a glovebox. Under the bonnet the 100E still housed an antiquated, but actually new, side-valve engine sharing the bore and stroke of the old unit but now with larger bearings and inlet valves and pump-assisted cooling. The three-speed gearbox was retained. Some models were fitted with a semi-automatic \\"Manumatic\\" gearbox. A second wind-screen wiper was now included at no extra cost, although the wipers' vacuum-powered operation was also retained: by now this was seen as seriously old-fashioned and the wipers were notorious for slowing down when driving up steep hills, or coming to a complete rest when trying to overtake. The separate chassis construction of the previous models was replaced by unitary construction and the front suspension used \\"hydraulic telescopic dampers and coil springs\\" ‚Äì now called MacPherson struts, a term that had not yet entered the public lexicon ‚Äì with anti-roll bar and semi- elliptic leaf springs at the rear. The car's wheelbase was the shortest of any Anglia, but the front and rear track were increased to , and cornering on dry roads involved a degree of understeer: the steering took just two turns between locks, making the car responsive and easy to place on the road, although on wet roads it was easy to make the tail slide out. A rare option for 1957 and 1958 was Newtondrive clutchless gearchange. The electrical system became 12 volt. A facelift of the Anglia 100E was announced in October 1957. This included a new mesh radiator grille, new front lamp surrounds, a larger rear window, larger tail lights and chrome bumpers. The 100E sold well; by the time production ceased in 1959, 345,841 had rolled off the production line. There were from 1955 two estate car versions, similar to the Thames 300E vans but fitted with side windows, folding rear seats and a horizontally split tailgate. This necessitated moving the fuel tank. These were the basic Escort and better appointed Squire, which sported wood trim down the sides. This feature has become a common feature of some Ford estates/station wagons ever since. The basic van variant was badged as a Thames product, as were all Ford commercials following the dropping of the Fordson badge. An Anglia saloon tested by the British Motor magazine in 1954 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 29.4 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost ¬£511 including taxes. File:Ford Anglia 100E Schaffen-Diest 2012.jpg1957 Ford Anglia 100E (earlier grille) File:Ford- anglia-101e-1958.jpg1958 Ford Anglia 100E (later grille) Anglia 105E (1959‚Äì68) The fourth Anglia model, the 105E, was introduced in 1959. Its American-influenced styling included a sweeping nose line, and on deluxe versions, a full-width slanted chrome grille in between prominent \\"eye\\" headlamps. (Basic Anglias featured a narrower, painted grille.) Its smoothly sloped line there looked more like a 1950s Studebaker (or even early Ford Thunderbird) than the more aggressive-looking late-'50s American Fords, possibly because its British designers used wind-tunnel testing and streamlining. Like late-'50s Lincolns and Mercurys (and later the Citro√´n Ami of France and the Consul Classic), the car sported a backward-slanted rear window (so that it would remain clear in rain, according to contemporary marketing claims). In fact, this look was imported from the 1958 Lincoln Continental, where it had been the accidental result of a design specification for an electrically opening (breezeway) rear window. It had muted tailfins, much toned-down from its American counterparts. An estate car joined the saloon in the line-up in September 1961. The instrument panel had a red light for the generator and a green one for the oil pressure. The new styling was joined by something the smaller Fords had been needing for some time, a new engine - a 997 cc overhead valve (OHV) straight-four with an oversquare cylinder bore that became known as the \\"Kent\\". Acceleration from rest was still sluggish, but it was much improved from earlier cars. Also new for British Fords was a four-speed manual gearbox with synchromesh on the top three forward ratios: this was replaced by an all-synchromesh box in September 1962 (on 1198 powered cars). The notoriously feeble vacuum-powered windscreen wipers of earlier Anglias were replaced with more conventional windscreen wipers powered by their own electric motor. The Macpherson strut independent front suspension used on the 100E was retained. In October 1962, 24-year-old twins Tony and Michael Brookes and a group of friends took an Anglia 105E fitted with the ¬£13 Ford Performance Kit to Montlh√©ry Autodrome near Paris and captured six International Class G World Records averaging . These were 4,5,6 and 7 days and nights and . The Anglia's strength and durability meant only tyre changes were required. The car's commercial success has subsequently been overshadowed by the even greater sales achieved by the Cortina: in 1960, when 191,752 Anglias left Ford's Dagenham plant in the 105E's first full production year, it set a new production-volume record for the Ford Motor Company. From October 1963, production continued at Ford's new Halewood plant at Merseyside alongside the newly introduced Corsair models. The Anglia Super introduced in September 1962 for the 1963 model year shared the longer stroke 1198 cc version of the Ford Kent 997 cc engine of the newly introduced Ford Cortina. The Anglia Super was distinguished by its painted contrasting-coloured side stripe. A new Anglia saloon tested by the British Motor magazine in 1959 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 26.9 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost ¬£610 including taxes of ¬£180. The old 100E Anglia became the new 100E Popular and the four-door Prefect bodyshell remained available as the new Ford Prefect (107E) which had all 105E running gear, including engine and brakes, while the 100E Escort and Squire remained available, unchanged. In 1961 the Escort and Squire were replaced by the 105E Anglia estate. The 100E delivery van also gave way to a new vehicle based on the 105E. Identical to the Anglia 105E back to the B post, the rest of the vehicle was entirely new. In South Africa, the Anglia's popularity came late. Sales really took off in early 1966, with the local introduction of the Anglia Super, and 1967 was the car's best year, with a ninth place in overall automobile registrations. Production actually continued longer in South Africa than anywhere else; it was built alongside the Escort from remaining stock until at least the end of 1968.Owners mourn the end of the Anglia 105E era, p. 36 File:Ford Anglis estate notdeluxe 997cc first registered July 1967 phoographed at Knebworth.jpgFord Anglia 105E Estate. The basic Anglia 105E featured a smaller, painted grille with a chromed reveal, rendering it easily identifiable from the De Luxe 105E.

Although they shared some front body panels with the Anglia Saloon, the vans were structurally quite different and had a taller windscreen and differently shaped side doors. Left hand drive export versions were designated Thames 308E. The Anglia name was used for certain export markets. From October 1962 the 5 cwt and 7 cwt Vans were also offered with the 1198cc engine from the Ford Anglia Super and these were designated Thames 309E. Left hand drive export versions were designated Thames 310E. In March 1965 the use of the Thames name was discontinued and from that time all Anglia-based vans were marketed as Ford Anglias. Production ended in November 1967 with a total of 205,001 vans having been produced. Anglia Torino 105E (1965‚Äì67) The Anglia Torino 105E was developed by the Italian subsidiary of Ford, using the chassis and mechanical components of the 105E Saloon, with new body panels. The Torino was styled by Giovanni Michelotti and built in Turin by Officine Stampaggi Industriali. 10,007 examples were sold in Italy. The model was also marketed in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Ford Anglia Torino 105E Anglia Super 123E (1962‚Äì67) From 1962, the 123E Anglia Super was available alongside the 105E, replacing the last of the line of Prefects, with a larger 1198 cc engine and other refinements. The same car was also sold in Europe. One Europe-only variant was the Anglia Sportsman, which carried its spare tyre on the back, somewhat similar to the continental kit often seen in the United States. Chrome bumper overriders, broad whitewall tyres, and optionally a side stripe kicking up at the end into the tail- lights/fin were also fitted. The Super only arrived in South Africa in 1966, although it did boost sales considerably. Towards the end of the run Ford experimented with two colours of metallic paint on the Anglia, \\"Blue Mink\\" and \\"Venetian Gold\\". 250 were made in the Blue and 500 were made in the Gold. Anglia saloons were provided with various levels of trim. The base model was the Standard, and this sported no chromework, painted rear light surrounds, steel slatted grille and limited interior trim. The deluxe had a chrome side strip, chrome rear lights, glovebox lid, sun visor and full width chrome radiator grille. The top of the range was the Super, which had twin chrome side strips, contrasting coloured roof and side flash, plusher interior trim, together with the 1198 cc engine and a gearbox with synchromesh on first gear. Optional extras were the mechanical upgrade of a Deluxe to a Super, retaining the Deluxe trim, or the upgrade of a Deluxe to a Super trim, but retaining the 997 cc engine, an option rarely taken up.

Its southern end is about north of the city of Winnipeg. Lake Winnipeg is Canada's sixth-largest freshwater lake and the third-largest freshwater lake contained entirely within Canada, but it is relatively shallow (mean depth of )International Lake Environment Committee excluding a narrow deep channel between the northern and southern basins. It is the eleventh-largest freshwater lake on Earth. The lake's east side has pristine boreal forests and rivers that were recently inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The lake is from north to south, with remote sandy beaches, large limestone cliffs, and many bat caves in some areas. Manitoba Hydro uses the lake as one of the largest reservoirs in the world. There are many islands, most of them undeveloped. The Sagkeeng First Nation holds a reserve on Turtle Island, in the southern part of the lake. The Anishinaabe people have been in this area for hundreds of years.  Hydrography  NASA false-colour image of Lake Winnipeg Lake Winnipeg has the largest watershed of any lake in Canada, receiving water from four U.S. states (North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota and Montana via tributaries of the Oldman River) and four Canadian provinces (Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario and Manitoba). The lake's watershed measures about . Its drainage is about 40 times larger than its surface, a ratio bigger than any other large lake in the world. Lake Winnipeg drains northward into the Nelson River at an average annual rate of 2,066 cubic metres per second (72,960 cu ft/s), and forms part of the Hudson Bay watershed, which is one of the largest drainage basins in the world. This watershed area was known as Rupert's Land when the Hudson's Bay Company was chartered in 1670. = Tributaries = Nelson River drainage basin The Saskatchewan River flows in from the west through Cedar Lake, the Red River (including Assiniboine River) flows in from the south, and the Winnipeg River (draining Lake of the Woods, Rainy River and Rainy Lake) enters from the southeast. The Dauphin River enters from the west, draining Lake Manitoba and Lake Winnipegosis. The Bloodvein River, Berens River, Poplar River and the Manigotagan River flow in from the eastern side of the lake which is within the Canadian Shield. Other tributaries of Lake Winnipeg (clockwise from the south end) include; Meleb Drain (drainage canal), Drunken River, Icelandic River, Washow Bay Creek, Sugar Creek, Beaver Creek, Mill Creek, Moose Creek, Fisher River, Jackhead River, Kinwow Bay Creek, Jackpine Creek, Mantagao River, Solomons Creek, Jumping Creek, Warpath River, South Two Rivers, North Two Rivers, South Twin Creek, North Twin Creek, Saskachaywiak Creek, Eating Point Creek, Woody Point Creeks, Muskwa Creek, Buffalo Creek, Fiddler Creek, Sturgeon Creek, Hungry River, Cypress Creek, William River, B√©langer River, Mukutawa River, Crane Creek, Kapawekapuk Creek, Marchand Creek, Leaf River, Pigeon River, Taskapekawe Creek, Bradbury River, Petopeko Creek, Loon Creek, Sanders Creek, Rice River, Wanipigow River, Barrie Creek, Mutch Creek, Sandy River, Black River, Sandy Creek, Catfish Creek, Jackfish Creek, Marais Creek, Brokenhead River and Devils Creek. Geology Lake Winnipeg and Lake Manitoba are remnants of prehistoric Glacial Lake Agassiz, although there is evidence of a desiccated south basin of Lake Winnipeg approximately 4,000 years ago. The area between the lakes is called the Interlake Region, and the whole region is called the Manitoba Lowlands. Natural history=Fish= The varying habitats found within the lake support a large number of fish species, more than any other lake in Canada west of the Great Lakes. Sixty of seventy- nine native species found in Manitoba are present in the lake. Families represented include lampreys (Petromyzontidae), sturgeon (Acipenseridae), mooneyes (Hiodontidae), minnows (Cyprinidae), suckers (Catostomidae), catfishes (Ictaluridae), pikes (Esocidae), trout and whitefish (Salmonidae), troutperch (Percopsidae), codfishes (Gadidae), sticklebacks (Gasterosteidae), sculpins (Cottidae), sunfishes (Centrarchidae), perch (Percidae), and drums (Sciaenidae). Two fish species present in the lake are considered to be at risk, the shortjaw cisco and the bigmouth buffalo. Rainbow trout and brown trout are stocked in Manitoba waters by provincial fisheries as part of a put and take program to support angling opportunities. Neither species is able to sustain itself independently in Manitoba. Smallmouth bass was first recorded from the lake in 2002, indicating populations introduced elsewhere in the watershed are now present in the lake. White bass were first recorded from the lake in 1963, ten years after being introduced into Lake Ashtabula in North Dakota. Common carp were introduced to the lake through the Red River of the North and are firmly established. =Birds= Lake Winnipeg provides feeding and nesting sites for a wide variety of birds associated with water during the summer months. American White Pelicans loaf near shore, Hecla-Grindstone Provincial Park Isolated, uninhabited islands provide nesting sites for colonial nesting birds including pelicans, gulls and terns. Large marshes, shores and shallows allow these birds to successfully feed themselves and their young. Pipestone Rocks are considered a globally significant site for American white pelicans. In 1998, an estimated 3.7% of the world's population of this bird at the time were counted nesting on the rocky outcrops. The same site is significant within North America for the numbers of colonial waterbirds using the area, especially Common terns. Other globally significant nesting areas are found at Gull Island and Sandhill Island, Little George Island and Louis Island. Birds nesting at these sites include Common and Caspian terns, Herring gull, Ring-billed gull, Double-crested cormorant and Greater scaup. Lake Winnipeg has two sites considered globally important in the fall migration. Large populations of waterfowl and shorebirds use the sand bars east of Riverton as a staging area for fall migration. The Netley-Libau Marsh, where the Red River enters Lake Winnipeg, is used by geese, ducks and swallows to gather for the southward migration. Piping Plovers, an endangered species of shorebird, are found in several locations around the lake. The Gull Bay Spits, south of the town of Grand Rapids are considered nationally significant nesting sites for this species. =Protected areas= *Beaver Creek Provincial Park *Camp Morton Provincial Park *Elk Island Provincial Park *Fisher Bay Provincial Park *Grand Beach Provincial Park *Hecla-Grindstone Provincial Park *Hnausa Beach Provincial Park *Kinwow Provincial Park *Patricia Beach Provincial Park *Sturgeon Bay Provincial Park *Winnipeg Beach Provincial Park =Environmental issues= Lake Winnipeg is suffering from many environmental issues such as an explosion in the population of algae, caused by excessive amounts of phosphorus seeping into the lake, therefore not absorbing enough nitrogen.$1.1M for Lake Winnipeg - Winnipeg Free PressCanada‚Äôs sickest lake , MacLean's Magazine The phosphorus levels are approaching a point that could be dangerous for human health. The Global Nature Fund declared Lake Winnipeg as the \\"threatened lake of the year\\" in 2013. In 2015, there was a major uptick of zebra mussels in Lake Winnipeg, the reduction of which is next to impossible because of a lack of natural predators in the lake. The mussels are devastating to the ecological opportunities of the lake.Lake Winnipeg a lost cause - CBC Online  History  It is believed Henry Kelsey was the first European to see the lake, in 1690. He adopted the Cree language name for the lake: wƒ´nipƒìk (·êê·ìÇ·êØ·ê†), meaning \\"muddy waters\\". La V√©rendrye referred to the lake as Ouinipigon when he built the first forts in the area in the 1730s. Later, the Red River Colony to its south took the lake's name for Winnipeg, the capital of Manitoba. Lake Winnipeg lies along one of the oldest trading routes in North America to have flown the British flag. For several centuries, furs were traded along this route between York Factory on Hudson BayFur Trade Canoe Routes of Canada/ Then and Now by Eric W. Morse Canada National and Historic Parks Branch, first printing 1969. (which was the longtime headquarters for the Hudson's Bay Company) over Lake Winnipeg and the Red River Trails to the confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers at Saint Paul, Minnesota. This was a strategic trading route for the First British Empire. With the establishment of the Second British Empire after Britain's loss of the Thirteen Colonies, a significant increase in trade occurred over Lake Winnipeg between Rupert's Land and the United States.  Economy = Transportation = Because of its length, the Lake Winnipeg water system and the lake was an important transportation route in the province before the railways reached Manitoba. It continued to be a major transportation route even after the railways reached the province. In addition to aboriginal canoes and York boats, several steamboats plied the lake, including Anson Northup, City of Selkirk, Colvile, Keenora, Premier, Princess, Winnitoba, Wolverine and most recently the diesel- powered MS Lord Selkirk II passenger cruise ship. = Communities = Communities on the lake include Grand Marais, Lester Beach, Riverton, Gimli, Winnipeg Beach, Victoria Beach, Hillside beach, Pine Falls, Manigotagan, Berens River, Bloodvein, Sandy Hook, Albert Beach, Hecla Village and Grand Rapids. A number of pleasure beaches are found on the southern end of the lake, which are popular in the summer, attracting many visitors from Winnipeg, about 80 km south. Gimli on Lake Winnipeg. = Commercial fisheries = Lake Winnipeg has important commercial fisheries. Its catch makes up a major part of Manitoba's $30 million per year fishing industry. The lake was once the main source of goldeye in Canada, which is why the fish is sometimes called Winnipeg goldeye. Walleye and whitefish together account for over 90 percent of its commercial fishing.

Founded in 1938, NS provides rail services on the Dutch main rail network (). The Dutch rail network is the busiest in the European Union, and third busiest in the world after Switzerland and Japan., International Union of Railways Annual Report, 2015. The rail infrastructure is maintained by network manager ProRail, which was split off from NS in 2003. Freight services, formerly operated by NS Cargo, merged with DB Schenker in 2000. NS runs 4,800 scheduled domestic trains a day, serving 1.1 million passengers. Also, NS provides international rail services from the Netherlands to other European destinations and carries out concessions on some foreign rail markets through its subsidiary Abellio.  History =Founding (1938)= The Hoofdgebouw I (Main Building I) complex in Utrecht, former Nederlandse Spoorwegen headquarters and nowadays the office of DB Cargo in the Netherlands Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS) was founded in 1938 when the two largest Dutch railway companies, the Hollandsche IJzeren Spoorweg-Maatschappij (HSM) and the Maatschappij tot Exploitatie van Staatsspoorwegen (SS), formally merged. These two companies had already been intensively cooperating as early as 1917. There were both economic and ideological reasons for the cooperation. As a result of World War I, the Dutch economy had declined causing HSM and SS to fall from profitability. Given their national importance, allowing them to slip into bankruptcy was not considered acceptable. While remaining independent companies, HSM and SS improved overall efficiency by cooperatively integrating their operations. The Government of the Netherlands further supported HSM and SS by purchasing shares in both firms. In 1938, the authorities merged the two companies to form the Nederlandse Spoorwegen. In the process, the Government of the Netherlands bought all remaining shares, yet never nationalised the company. Therefore, Nederlandse Spoorwegen remained, and still is owned by the Dutch Government. =Early years as a state enterprise (1940s‚Äì1970s)= During World War II the NS remained an independent company, but was forced to do the Germans' bidding; NS was forced to construct the railway lines to camp Westerbork and help in the deportation of almost a hundred thousand Jews to extermination camps. The NS went on a strike once during the war, in the winter of 1944-45, after it had declined to participate in one a year earlier. The NS played a pivotal role in the reconstruction of the country. There was little alternative transport in the country besides the train, while there was a huge demand for logistical services which the NS could provide. While the 1950s were a good time for the company, it started to decline in the 1960s, like most other railways around the world. Not only did the NS suffer from the competition of the car and other modes of transport, but it also suffered from a loss of income when natural gas started to replace coal as the main fuel in power stations and homes after a gas field was found near Slochteren. The NS had been involved in the transport of coal from the mines in Limburg to the remainder of the country. The NS responded with an aggressive strategy named Spoorslag '70. This strategy meant, among other things, that the NS substantially increased the number of trains per hour and also introduced the Intercity services. However, it was quite clear that this would never return the company to profitability. Nevertheless, the company was declared to be of national importance, meaning that it would receive large amounts of subsidies every year. =Reforms period (1980s‚Äì2000s)= Protests against neoliberal policies in 1983 In the early 1990s, the Government of the Netherlands started to question the subsidies given to the NS. Not only were there questions regarding the way the NS spent the subsidies, but, after the neoliberal reforms of the 1980s, it was also considered not done to award generic subsidies to companies. The authorities decided on the verzelfstandiging (corporatisation) of the NS although technically, this is not the case, but instead refers here to withdrawal of the subsidies. The idea was that not only rail transport was economically viable, but that there could be competition as well. There were two external circumstances which allowed for this to happen. Firstly, the European Union passed Directive 91/440, which prescribed, among other things, the formal separation of the national railways into two separate companies, one which deals with the infrastructure, and the other which deals with the transport activities. Secondly, the old CEO of the NS, Leo Ploeger, retired, which allowed the authorities to name a new CEO which would execute the government's plans. The new CEO was Rob den Besten. The plans entailed that the Government of the Netherlands would remain responsible for the rail infrastructure, while the NS would provide the passenger transport on a commercial basis. Where the services would prove to be economically inviable, the government would subsidise that route. The division which was responsible for the infrastructure would later be turned into NS Railinfratrust. Current headquarters in Utrecht To facilitate government plans for the company's commercial operation, Den Besten planned to split the NS into many smaller independent divisions. The idea was that these smaller divisions would be better able to respond to the market. The plans, however, received massive opposition from the unions, which meant that the only divisions created were NS Reizigers, and locomotive maintenance company NedTrain. There were also other internal changes in the company. The route managers got de facto control over the operation, but they were dependent of a different organ in the company. The freight sector NS Cargo became part of Deutsche Bahn after its merger with Railion in 2000 (later into DB Cargo).DB and NS sign freight merger Railway Gazette International 1 August 1999 These reforms were never much of a success and left the company in an uncontrollable state. The result was that the company started to decline rapidly, and that the employees started many unorganised strikes. Following this, the complete board of directors felt it necessary to resign in late 2001. In 2002 Karel Noordzij was named as new CEO of the NS with the mission to restore the confidence in the company. In essence, he did this by reversing most the reforms of the late 1990s and restoring the company to the old state. Meanwhile, the government had changed its opinion of the railways, it no longer considered competition on (passenger) transport a viable goal. Thus, the government started to commission railway operators to run routes on the network. The NS was granted (by the national government) the concession to run on the main lines, whereas other companies received a number of the concessions on the secondary lines. The goal is to give individual concessions for the individual lines, but (at least) until 2025 the NS holds the concessions for main lines. =Recent years (2010s)= The timetable change on 10 December 2006 saw the most routes to approximate the symmetry time in clock-face schedules to the one used in most other European countries. Previously, this was different at minute (46 seconds) and led to problems by cross-border trains. In August 2015, former Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations Roger van Boxtel was named CEO of Nederlandse Spoorwegen.  Controversies  NS has been involved in various controversies. * Technical problems with the high-speed V250 trains, which started its services on 29 July 2012, and ended on 17 January 2013, led to the resignation of CEO Bert Meerstadt in June 2013 and to a parliamentary investigation in 2015. The High Speed Alliance (HSA), a NS (90%) / KLM (10%) joint venture almost went broke due to the late introduction of the trains in combination with a too high price for the concession which the company paid to the Dutch government. HSA was liquidated in 2015. * In 2013, it was revealed that NS had been using a subsidiary in Ireland, NS Financial Services Company (NSFSC), to reduce its tax liability in the Netherlands. The procedure was determined to be lawful, but it was unfavorable for the Dutch taxpayers for a state-owned company to avoid national taxes. From 1998 the NS used the favourable tax climate in Ireland, which resulted in a profit to NS of more than ‚Ç¨270 million but a loss to the Dutch state of ‚Ç¨21 million in 2012 alone. The corporate tax rate in Ireland was 12.5%, in the Netherlands 25% at that time. NS used its Irish subsidiary to buy new trains, among others the high- speed V250 trains from the Italian firm Ansaldo Breda. The Dutch Minister of Finance, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, wrote to the parliament that NS would stop this tax evasion. Most rolling stock was transferred to the Netherlands-based NS Lease in December 2017.NS repatriates train leasing Railway Gazette International 26 February 2018 NSFSC was wound up in April 2019.NS ends Irish- registered leasing activities Railway Gazette International 29 April 2019 * In 2015 it became clear that a subsidiary of NS, Abellio, had shown unfair behaviour with regard to a tendering for public transport in the province of Limburg. The company had obtained confidential information from a competitor, Veolia, through a former employee of Veolia who had been hired by Abellio subsidiary Qbuzz. On 5 June 2015, it became clear that CEO Timo Huges of the NS had given incomplete and incorrect information about the tendering procedure. According to Minister Dijsselbloem, Huges had acted \\"sloppy, inaccurate and in violation of the law.\\" Consequently, Huges resigned from his position.  Coverage  The NS covers most of the country, with almost all cities connected, mostly with a service frequency of two trains an hour or more and at least four trains per hour between all of the largest five cities (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht and Eindhoven) as well as some smaller cities (Nijmegen, Amersfoort, Arnhem, 's-Hertogenbosch, Dordrecht and Leiden). From December 2008 train frequencies were increased on following services: Arnhem‚ÄìNijmegen (8 trains per hour) and The Hague‚ÄìRotterdam (12 trains per hour), Amsterdam Centraal‚ÄìHoofddorp (16 trains per hour). A night train service was added between Utrecht, Gouda and Rotterdam.www.treinreiziger.nl Trains usually run between 5:00 a.m. and 1:00 a.m. although there is also a night line which connects major cities in the Randstad throughout the night, as well as in weekends also some major cities in North Brabant. In addition to its domestic services, NS is also a partner (along with Stena Line and its British railway company Abellio Greater Anglia) in the Dutchflyer service. NS has also entered into a partnership with KLM to operate services on the new HSL-Zuid under the name Intercity Direct towards Breda and Brussels. Intercity Direct is part of NS International; other services such as Thalys to France and Intercity-Express to Germany and Switzerland are also part of NS International. =Rail network= NS trains at Arnhem Centraal The hoofdrailnet is the official core internal passenger railnetwork of the Netherlands. Currently NS has a concession until 1 January 2015 to provide all passenger services on this network, except that on some stretches there is an overlap with lines for which other operators have a concession. Some of the most notable of these stretches are those from Elst railway station to Arnhem Centraal railway station, where NS shares tracks with Arriva, and further on to Arnhem Velperpoort. Here the tracks are shared by three operators, as Breng, ultimately part of Transdev, operates there in addition to the two previously mentioned operators. Officially the overlaps do not constitute competition on the same lines. The concession was free of charge until 2009, and costs an increasing amount since then, up to ‚Ç¨30 million for the year 2014. The concession distinguishes main stations and other stations. Except on New Year's Eve, the main stations have to be served at least twice an hour per direction from 6 a.m. to midnight and the other stations at least once an hour. Exceptions are possible until the start of the next concession. The next concession period is 2025‚Äì2035. For the 2015‚Äì2025 concession, requirements include: for every train service where on average more than one-third of the passengers travel longer than 30 minutes, a train with a toilet is used, every newly ordered train has a toilet and in 2025 every train has to have a toilet. Currently trains on the hoofdrailnet without a toilet include the NS SGMm numbers 2111 to 2125, the so-called classical \\"Sprinter\\" and the Sprinter Lighttrain (SLT, these trains are being converted periodically to have a toilet on board).  Types of train service  NS provides three kinds of train service: # A Sprinter stops at all stations, and is mainly used for local traffic. On some smaller lines, though, it is the only kind of service. The name is derived from the 'Sprinter' (2900 class) rolling stock; however, the service was sometimes operated using older style rolling stock (such as 'Plan V/T': 400, 500, 800 and 900 class). # Intercity services only stop at larger stations, and were introduced in the 1970s to provide fast train connections throughout the country. Intercity services are operated by DDZ, VIRM and ICM class trains. An exception is the service between Den Haag Centraal and Eindhoven, which makes use of the high-speed line between Rotterdam and Breda, and requires Bombardier Traxx-hauled carriages. When a line is not served by Sprinters, Intercity trains stop at all stations. This takes place on the lines between Alkmaar - Den Helder, Bergen op Zoom - Vlissingen, Hoorn - Enkhuizen, Leiden - Woerden, and Deurne - Venlo. See also Intercity services in the Netherlands and List of Dutch Intercity stations . # The Intercity Direct service, which offers faster service between Amsterdam Centraal and Breda as it makes use of the high-speed line HSL-Zuid and calls at only two intermediate stations (Schiphol Airport and Rotterdam Centraal). Unlike other Intercity trains, the Intercity Direct requires payment of a supplement on top of the regular fare (‚Ç¨2.60 if bought online and swiping on the platform during peak hours and ‚Ç¨1,56 when swiping during off-peak hours) if a passenger's journey involves the high-speed line between Schiphol Airport and Rotterdam Centraal. A regular Intercity service that is free of supplements is still offered. There are also two former train categories, which are now used only by private operators: # Stoptrein: This is the original name for Sprinter trains. Between 2003 and 2013 NS discharged the Stoptrein formula in favour of Sprinter. Private operators do not use Sprinter so all private services in the Netherlands (except of the four Sneltreins of Arriva, see below) are Stoptrein. # Sneltrein: Sneltrein (in the English section of the old paper time tables, they were translated as \\"semi fast train\\" and were a class between Stoptrain and Intercity) was abandoned by NS in 2008. The NS Sneltrein services are now called Intercity, but they stop more often than \\"real\\" Intercities. The result is that some stations (like Woerden) are served by some Intercities while others pass it. As of 2015, there are four Sneltrein services by Arriva.  Fares and tickets  Rijssen to Almelo and back. The OV-chipkaart is the common form of fare payment. Single or return tickets, used by incidental travellers and tourists, are available at ticket machines and service counters at a surcharge of ‚Ç¨1. They are a disposable use-once only. It is possible to buy e-tickets online on the Dutch Railways website. E-tickets can also be purchased on the Belgian NMBS/SNCB B-Europe website. For long term use season tickets are available.Find the season ticket that suits you Travelling with these cards and tickets, one has to register starting a journey (check in) and ending it (check out) at the destination. One always has to travel away from the point of one's latest check-in. Thus, in the case of a voluntary detour, one has to check out and check in to register starting a new journey. Travellers need to be aware of the various companies other than the Nederlandse Spoorwegen. One needs to check out with one company and check in with another on some stations. There is common tariff system with four smaller passenger train operating companies: Keolis Nederland and Connexxion in the centre and the east, Veolia on the 'Maaslijn' and 'Heuvellandlijn' in the south east, Arriva in the north and most of the east of the country and on the 'Merwede- Lingelijn' (from Dordrecht to Geldermalsen). The OV-chipkaart is also used on buses and trams, where hourly tickets are for sale for those who have too little credit to travel but enough cash. = Off-peak discount passes = NS defines off-peak hours as weekdays 09:00-16:00 and 18:30-06:30, and on Saturdays and Sundays the whole day. Therefore, full fare is required on weekdays 06:30-09:00 and 16:00-18:30. With an OV-chipkaart that allows for a discount or free travel one is automatically granted the discount or free travel at the time of checking in. There is a number of season tickets available that suit individual preferences.All 7 season tickets (that allow for discounts) Logo Maastricht station in 2010 The NS corporate logo was designed in 1968 by Gert Dumbar and Gert-Jan Leuvelink both of the graphic design company Tel Design. Introduced in that same year, it replaced an earlier design which had been used since 1946. The logo, pervasive within trains and railway stations in the Netherlands, plays a significant part in Nederlandse Spoorwegen's signage, promotions, advertising and graphic design. The logo usually appears in blue or black on a dark yellow or white background. Since its introduction, NS livery has also had this same distinct dark yellow or white colour. The logo is a widened letter 'N' and a sideways (reversed) 'S'-shape. The two arrows in the logo represent the train's movement, and the two lines in the middle represent the track.

In dealing with the general public, these distinctions are not made and the terms Nederlandse Spoorwegen and NS are used. NS has contracts with Connexxion and BBA, now Veolia Transport for the provision of bus services to replace train services in the case of planned and unplanned cancellations. On 23 July 2010 NS sold Strukton to the construction company Oranjewoud N.V.. This concluded a long history of planning, designing and executing track development done by the NS.Oranjewoud N.V., the holding company that owns Strukton. Policy There is a delay refund scheme entitling passengers to a partial or full refund of the ticket price if a journey is delayed by half an hour or more. The scheme does not apply on short-distance journeys (tickets less than ‚Ç¨2.30) and cases in which the delay is the result of planned cancellations that were announced some days in advance. Refunds are, in general, half the ticket price of a one-way trip after a delay of over 30 minutes, the full ticket price after a delay of one hour or more. That applies to nearly all kinds of tickets. The refund is not considered a monetary compensation for lost time but rather as a reduction in charges where a poor service has been provided. The system has improved for holders of some rail passes. Part of the cost of the scheme is paid by ProRail, since they are responsible for part of the delays. Since 1 January 2004, tobacco smoking is prohibited on domestic trains, station halls and covered parts of platforms. The smoking of cannabis was already prohibited. Smoking is allowed near smoking-zones (Rookzones), posts with an ash-tray built in, scattered around stations. Since June 2003, the sale of coffee, soft drinks, beer, sandwiches, candy, etc., has ceased aboard domestic trains. The increasing number of Servex convenience stores at railway stations and the relatively short duration of most train journeys in the Netherlands have lowered the demand for on-train services. In 2005, a much reduced in-train service of drinks and small snacks has been reintroduced on longer journeys. Now, the RailTender service primarily operates in the intercity trains on the trajectory between Utrecht and Zwolle/Eindhoven, Zwolle and Almere, 's-Hertogenbosch and Nijmegen, Apeldoorn and Amersfoort, Rotterdam and Breda/Roosendaal/Antwerp Technological assistance for train staff Conductors have a smartphone with timetable, fares information, and a separate cardreader to read the OV-chipkaart. Statistics *14.73 billion passenger km per year (2005), which is 30% of the seat km. In 2018, NS saw its number of passengers increase by nearly 3 percent. On average, 1.3 million people took the train on a weekday, 100.000 more than in 2016 and the over 250 NS train stations are becoming increasingly crowded.

It has been a focus of dispute between the Hindu and Muslim communities since the 18th century. According to the mosque's inscriptions, it was built in 1528‚Äì29 (935 AH) by general Mir Baqi, on the orders of the Mughal emperor Babur. The mosque was attacked and demolished by Hindu Kar Sevaks in 1992, which ignited communal violence across the Indian subcontinent. The mosque was located on a hill known as Ramkot (\\"Rama's fort\\"). According to Hindus, Baqi destroyed a pre-existing temple of Rama at the site. The existence of this temple is a matter of controversy. Starting in the 19th century, there were several conflicts and court disputes between Hindus and Muslims over the mosque. In 1949, Hindu activists associated with the Hindu Mahasabha surreptitiously placed idols of Rama inside the mosque, after which the government locked the building to avoid further disputes. Court cases were filed by both Hindus and Muslims asking for access. The police locked the gates so that the public (Hindus as well as Muslims) could not enter. On 6 December 1992, a large group of Hindu activists belonging to the Vishva Hindu Parishad and allied organisations demolished the mosque, triggering riots all over the Indian subcontinent, killing around 2,000 people. In September 2010, the Allahabad High Court upheld the Hindu claim that the mosque was built on the spot believed to be Rama's birthplace and awarded the site of the central dome for the construction of a Rama temple. Muslims were also awarded one- third area of the site for the construction of a mosque.The Three Way Divide, Outlook, 30 September 2010. The decision was subsequently appealed by all parties to the Supreme Court, wherein a five judge bench heard a title suit from August to October 2019. On 9 November 2019, the Supreme Court quashed the lower court's judgement and ordered the entire site (2.77 acre land) to be handed over to a trust to build the Hindu temple. It also ordered the government to give an alternative five acre plot to the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board to replace the Babri Masjid that was demolished in 1992. The government allotted a site in the village of Dhannipur, from Ayodhya and by road from the site of the original Babri Masjid.  Etymology  The name \\"Babri Masjid\\" comes from the name of the Mughal emperor Babur, who is said to have ordered its construction. Before the 1940s, it was called Masjid-i Janmasthan (\\"mosque of the birthplace\\") including in official documents.Multiple sources state this fact:   Architecture = Background = The rulers of the Delhi Sultanate and their successors, the Mughals, were great patrons of art and architecture and constructed many fine tombs, mosques and madrasas. These have a distinctive style which bears influences of \\"later Tughlaq\\" architecture. Mosques all over India were built in different styles; the most elegant styles developed in areas where indigenous art traditions were strong and local artisans were highly skilled. Thus regional or provincial styles of mosques grew out of local temple or domestic styles, which were conditioned in their turn by climate, terrain, materials, hence the enormous difference between the mosques of Bengal, Kashmir and Gujarat. The Babri Mosque followed the architectural school of Jaunpur Sultanate. When viewed from the west side, it resembled the Atala Masjid in Jaunpur. = Architectural style = Site map of Babri Masjid The architecture of the mosque is completely a replica of the mosques in the Delhi Sultanate. Babri was an important mosque of a distinct style, preserved mainly in architecture, developed after the Delhi Sultanate was established, seen also in the Babari Mosque in the southern suburb of the walled city of Gaur, and the Jamali Kamili Mosque built by Sher Shah Suri. This was the forerunner of the Mughal architecture style adopted by Akbar. = Acoustics = \\"A whisper from the Babri Masjid mihrab could be heard clearly at the other end, 200 feet [60 m] away and through the length and breadth of the central court\\" according to Graham Pickford, architect to Lord William Bentinck (1828‚Äì33). The mosque's acoustics were mentioned by him in his book Historic Structures of Oudhe where he says \\"for a 16th-century building the deployment and projection of voice from the pulpit is considerably advanced, the unique deployment of sound in this structure will astonish the visitor\\". Modern architects have attributed this intriguing acoustic feature to a large recess in the wall of the mihrab and several recesses in the surrounding walls which functioned as resonators; this design helped everyone to hear the speaker at the mihrab. The sandstone used in building the Babri Mosque also had resonant qualities which contributed to the unique acoustics. = Ventilation = The Babri mosque's Tughluquid style integrated other design components and techniques, such as air cooling systems disguised as Islamic architectural elements like arches, vaults and domes. In the Babri Masjid a passive environmental control system comprised the high ceiling, domes, and six large grille windows. The system helped keep the interior cool by allowing natural ventilation as well as daylight.  History = Construction = The date of construction of the Babri Masjid is uncertain. The inscriptions on the Babri Masjid premises found in the 20th century state that the mosque was built in 935 AH (1528‚Äì29) by Mir Baqi in accordance with the wishes of Babur. However, these inscriptions appear to be of a more recent vintage. There are no records of the mosque from this period. The Baburnama (Chronicles of Babur) does not mention either the mosque or the destruction of a temple. The Ramcharitamanas of Tulsidas (1574) and Ain-i Akbari of Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak (1598) made no mention of a mosque either. William Finch, the English traveller who visited Ayodhya around 1611, wrote about the \\"ruins of the Ranichand [Ramachand] castle and houses\\" where Hindus believed the great God \\"took flesh upon him to see the tamasha of the world.\\" He found pandas (Brahmin priests) in the ruins of the fort, recording the names of pilgrims, but there was no mention of a mosque. Thomas Herbert described in 1634 the \\"pretty old castle of Ranichand built by a Bannyan Pagod of that name\\" which he described as an antique monument that was \\"especially memorable\\". He also recorded the fact of Brahmins recording the names of pilgrims. The earliest record of a mosque at the site traditionally believed by Hindus to be the birthplace of Rama comes from Jai Singh II (or \\"Sawai Jai Singh\\") ‚Äì a Rajput noble in the Mughal court who purchased land and established a Jaisinghpura in the area surrounding the mosque in 1717 (as he had also done in several other Hindu religious places). The documents of Jai Singh preserved in the Kapad- Dwar collection in the City Palace Museum of Jaipur, include a sketch map of the Babri Masjid site. The map shows an open court yard and a built structure with three temple spires (sikharas) resembling today's Babri Masjid with three domes. The courtyard is labelled janmasthan and shows a Ram chabutra. The central bay of the built structure is labelled chhathi, which also denotes birthplace. The European Jesuit missionary Joseph Tiefenthaler, who lived and worked in India for 38 years (1743‚Äì1785) and wrote numerous works about India, visited Ayodhya in 1767. Johann Bernoulli translated his work Descriptio Indiae (in Latin) into French, published in 1788. According to this account, Aurangzeb (r. 1658‚Äì1707) had demolished the Ramkot fortress, including the house that was considered as the birthplace of Rama by Hindus. A mosque with three domes was constructed in its place. However, he also noted, \\"others say that it was constructed by 'Babor' [Babur]\\". The Hindus continued to offer prayers at a mud platform that marked the birthplace of Rama. Tiefenthaler was well-versed in Persian and Sanskrit, having written a Sanskrit‚ÄìPersian dictionary, and other works in Persian. Evidently he did not find an inscription on the walls of the mosque stating that it was constructed under Babur's orders. He \\"emphatically attributed it to Aurangzeb, and Babur's name is carried by a few persons\\", states writer Kishore Kunal. = Inscriptions = Francis Buchanan-Hamilton (Buchanan) did a survey of the Gorakhpur Division in 1813‚Äì14 on behalf of the British East India Company. His report was never published but partly reused by Montgomery Martin later. Kishore Kunal examined the original report in the British Library archives. It states that the Hindus generally attributed destruction \\"to the furious zeal of Aurangzabe\\". However it said that the mosque at Ayodhya was ascertained to have been built by Babur by \\"an inscription on its walls\\". The said inscription in Persian was said to have been copied by a scribe and translated by a Maulvi friend of Buchanan. The translation however contained five pieces of text, including two inscriptions. The first inscription said that the mosque was constructed by Mir Baqi in the year 935 AH or 923 AH. The second inscription narrated the genealogy of Aurangzeb. In addition to the two inscriptions and their monograms (turghas), a fable concerning a dervish called Musha Ashiqan was also included. The translator doubted that the fable was part of the inscription but recorded that the scribe \\"positively says that the inscription was executed at the erection of this building\\". The translator also had a difficulty with the anagram for the date, because one of the words was missing, which would have resulted in a date of 923 AH rather than 935 AH. These incongruities and mismatches made no impression on Buchanan, who maintained that the mosque was built by Babur. In 1838, British surveyor Montgomery Martin wrote that the pillars in the mosque were taken from a Hindu temple. A section of historians, such as R. S. Sharma, deny this, and state that such claims of temple demolition sprang up only after the 18th century. In 1877, Syed Mohammad Asghar the Mutawalli (guardian) of the \\"Masjid Baburi at Janmasthan\\" filed a petition with the Commissioner of Faizabad asking him to restrain the Hindus that raised a chabutara on the spot regarded as the birthplace of Rama. In the petition, he stated that Babur had inscribed one word \\"Allah\\" above the door. The District Judge and the Sub-Judge visited the mosque in the presence of all parties and their lawyers and confirmed this fact. No other inscriptions were recorded. In 1889, archaeologist Anton F√ºhrer visited the mosque and found three inscriptions. One was a Quranic verse. The inscription XLI was Persian poetry in the metre Ramal, which stated that the mosque was erected by a noble 'Mir Khan' of Babur. The inscription XLII was also Persian poetry in metre Ramal, and said that the mosque was founded in year 930 AH by a grandee of Babur, who was (comparable to) \\"another King of Turkey and China\\". The year 930 AH corresponds to 1523, three years before Babur's conquest of Hindustan. Despite the apparent contradiction, F√ºhrer published the date of \\"A. H. 930 during the reign of Babar\\", in his book of 1891. Writer Kishore Kunal states that all the inscriptions claimed were fake. They were affixed almost 285 years after the supposed construction of the mosque in 1528, and repeatedly replaced. His own assessment is that the mosque was built around 1660 by governor Fedai Khan of Aurangzeb, who demolished many temples in Ayodhya. Lal Das, who wrote Awadh-Vilasa in 1672 describes the janmasthan (Rama's birthplace) accurately but does not mention a temple at the site. These developments were apparently known to local Muslims. In mid- nineteenth century, the Muslim activist Mirza Jan quoted from a book Sahifa-I- Chihil Nasaih Bahadur Shahi, which was said to have been written by a daughter of the emperor Bahadur Shah I (and granddaughter of Aurangzeb) in the early 18th century. The text mentions mosques having been constructed after demolishing the \\"temples of the idolatrous Hindus situated at Mathura, Banaras and Awadh etc.\\" Hindus are said to have called these demolished temples in Awadh \\"Sita Rasoi\\" (Sita's kitchen) and \\"Hanuman's abode.\\" While there was no mention of Babur in this account, the Ayodhya mosque had been juxtaposed with those built by Aurangzeb at Mathura and Banaras. The manuscript, Sahifa-I- Chihil Nasaih Bahadur Shahi, has not yet been found, and scholar Stephan Conermann has stated that Mirza Jan book, Hadiqa-yi shuhada, is not reliable. = Fable of Musa Ashiqan = According to an early 20th-century text by Maulvi Abdul Ghaffar and the surrounding historial sources examined by historian Harsh Narain, the young Babur came from Kabul to Awadh (Ayodhya) in disguise, dressed as a Qalandar (Sufi ascetic), probably as part of a fact- finding mission. Here he met the Sufi saints Shah Jalal and Sayyid Musa Ashiqan and took a pledge in return for their blessings for conquering Hindustan. The pledge is not spelled out in the 1981 edition of Ghaffar's book. Lala Sita Ram, who had access to the older edition in 1932 wrote, \\"The faqirs answered that they would bless him if he promised to build a mosque after demolishing the Janmasthan temple. Babur accepted the faqirs' offer and returned to his homeland.\\" = Other theories = However, some historians have argued that it was built during the Delhi Sultanate period (13th‚Äì15th century), and may have been renovated during Babur's period. R. Nath has stated that, judging from the architecture of the mosque, it should be taken to have been built in the pre-Mughal period. Apart from Hindus, Jains and Buddhists have also claimed the site. According to Jain Samata Vahini, the mosque was built over a 6th-century Jain temple. Similarly, Udit Raj's Buddha Education Foundation has claimed the mosque was built over a Buddhist shrine. = 1880s temple construction attempts = In 1853, a group of armed Hindu ascetics belonging to the Nirmohi Akhara occupied the site, and claimed ownership of the structure. Periodic violence erupted in the next two years, and the civil administration had to step in, refusing permission to build a temple or to use it as a place of worship. In 1855, after a Hindu-Muslim clash, a boundary wall was constructed to avoid further disputes. It divided the mosque premises into two courtyards; the Muslims offered prayers in the inner courtyard. The Hindus offered their prayers on a raised platform, known as \\"Ram Chabutara\\", in the outer courtyard. In 1883, the Hindus launched an effort to construct a temple on the platform. After Muslim protests, the Deputy Commissioner prohibited any temple construction on 19 January 1885. On 27 January 1885, Raghubar Das, the Hindu mahant (priest) of the Ram Chabutara filed a civil suit before the Faizabad Sub-Judge. In response, the mutawalli (Muslim trustee) of the mosque argued that the entire land belonged to the mosque. On 24 December 1885, the Sub Judge Pandit Hari Kishan Singh dismissed the suit. On 18 March 1886, the District Judge F.E.A. Chamier also dismissed an appeal against the lower court judgment. He agreed that the mosque was built on the land considered sacred by the Hindus, but ordered maintenance of status quo, since it was \\"too late now to remedy the grievance\\". A subsequent appeal before the Judicial Commissioner W. Young was also dismissed on 1 November 1886. On 27 March 1934, a Hindu‚ÄìMuslim riot occurred in Ayodhya, triggered by cow slaughter in the nearby Shahjahanpur village. The walls around the Masjid and one of the domes of the Masjid were damaged during the riots. These were reconstructed by the British Indian government. = Shia‚ÄìSunni dispute = In 1936, the United Provinces government enacted U.P. Muslim Waqf Act for the better administration of waqf properties in the state. In accordance with this act, the Babri Masjid and its adjacent graveyard (Ganj-e-Saheedan Qabristan) were registered as Waqf no. 26 Faizabad with the UP Sunni Central Board of Waqfs. The Shias disputed the Sunni ownership of the mosque, claiming that the site belonged to them because Mir Baqi was a Shia. The Commissioner of Waqfs initiated an inquiry into the dispute. The inquiry concluded that the mosque belonged to the Sunnis, since it was commissioned by Babur, who was a Sunni. The concluding report was published in an official gazette dated 26 February 1944. In 1945, the Shia Central Board moved to court against this decision. On 23 March 1946, Judge S. A. Ahsan ruled in favour of the UP Sunni Central Board of Waqfs. = Placement of Hindu idols = In December 1949, the Hindu organisation Akhil Bharatiya Ramayana Mahasabha organised a non-stop nine-day recitation of the Ramacharitamanas just outside the mosque. At the end of this event, on the night of 22‚Äì23 December 1949, a group of 50‚Äì60 people entered the mosque and placed idols of Rama and Sita there. On the morning of 23 December, the event organisers asked Hindu devotees to come to the mosque for a darshan. As thousands of Hindus started visiting the place, the Government declared the mosque a disputed area and locked its gates. Home Minister Vallabhbhai Patel and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru directed the state's Chief Minister Govind Ballabh Pant and Uttar Pradesh Home Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri to have the idols removed from the mosque premises. Pant issued orders to remove the idols, but Faizabad's deputy commissioner K. K. Nayar feared that the Hindus would retaliate and pleaded inability to carry out the orders. On 16 January 1950, Gopal Singh Visharad filed a civil suit in the Faizabad Court, asking that Hindus be allowed to worship Rama and Sita at the place. In 1959, the Nirmohi Akhara filed another lawsuit demanding possession of the mosque. On 18 December 1961, the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board also filed a lawsuit, demanding possession of the site and removal of idols from the mosque premises.  Demolition  In April 1984, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) initiated a campaign to gather public support for Hindu access to the Babri Masjid and other structures that had been allegedly built over Hindu shrines. To raise public awareness, VHP planned nationwide rath yatras (chariot processions*), the first of which took place in September‚ÄìOctober 1984, from Sitamarhi to Ayodhya. The campaign was temporarily suspended after assassination of Indira Gandhi, but revived in from 25 places on 23 October 1985. On 25 January 1986, a 28-year-old local lawyer Umesh Chandra Pandey, appealed to a court to remove the restrictions on Hindu worship in the Babri Masjid premises. Subsequently, the Rajiv Gandhi government ordered the locks on the Babri Masjid gates to be removed. Earlier, the only Hindu ceremony permitted at the site was a Hindu priest performing an annual puja. After the ruling, all Hindus were given access to the site, and the mosque gained some function as a Hindu temple. Communal tension in the region worsened when the VHP received permission to perform a shilanyas (stone-laying ceremony) at the disputed site before the national election in November 1989. A senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader, L K Advani, started a rath yatra, embarking on a 10,000 km journey starting from the south and heading towards Ayodhya. On 6 December 1992, BJP, VHP and RSS leaders gathered at the site to offer prayers and perform a symbolic kar seva. At noon, a teenage Kar Sevak (volunteer) was \\"vaulted\\" on to the dome and that signalled the breaking of the outer cordon. Soon after, a large number of kar sevaks demolished the mosque. = Aftermath = Communal riots between Hindus and Muslims occurred across India immediately following demolition of the mosque. Rioting in the immediate aftermath resulted in the deaths of an estimated 2,000 people. Six weeks of riots further erupted in Bombay, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 900 people. Jihadist outfits like Indian Mujahideen and Lashkar-e-Taiba have cited the demolition of Babri Masjid as justification for attacks directed against India. Gangster Dawood Ibrahim, wanted in India for his alleged ties to the 1993 Bombay bombings which killed 257 people, is believed to have been infuriated by the Babri Masjid's demolition. The site has since become a magnet for pilgrims. According to The Economist, \\"Among its souvenir stalls, those doing the briskest trade are the ones playing videos on a loop of Hindu fundamentalists demolishing the mosque.\\" = Regional impact = Riots in the aftermath of Babri Masjid's demolition extended to Bangladesh, where hundreds of shops, homes and temples of Hindus were destroyed. Widespread retaliatory attacks against scores of Hindu and Jain temples also took place across neighbouring Pakistan, with police not intervening. Reprisal attacks against Hindus in both countries, in turn, entered the discourse of right-wing Hindu nationalists ‚Äì for example, in 1995, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) appealed to the United Nations to protect Hindus in Bangladesh and Pakistan and Kashmir. The impact of Babri Masjid's demolition and its repercussions negatively affects relations between India and Pakistan until the present day. = Liberhan Commission = The Liberhan Commission set up by the Government to investigate the demolition later blamed 68 people including senior BJP, RSS and VHP leaders for the demolition. Among those criticised in the report were Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the party's chief LK Advani, and chief minister Kalyan Singh.Uproar over India mosque report: Inquiry into Babri mosque's demolition in 1992 indicts opposition BJP leaders Al-Jazeera English ‚Äì 24 November 2009 A 2005 book by the former Intelligence Bureau (IB) Joint Director Maloy Krishna Dhar claimed the senior leaders of RSS, BJP, VHP and Bajrang Dal had planned the demolition 10 months in advance. He also suggested that the Indian National Congress leaders, including prime minister P V Narasimha Rao and home minister S B Chavan, had ignored warnings about the demolition for deriving political benefits.Babri Masjid demolition was planned 10 months in advance ‚Äì PTI, Outlook, 30 January 2005.  Archaeological excavations  In 2003, by the order of an Indian court, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) was asked to conduct a more in-depth study and an excavation to ascertain the type of structure that was beneath the rubble. The excavation was conducted from 12 March 2003 to 7 August 2003, resulting in 1360 discoveries. The ASI submitted its report to the Allahabad high court. The summary of the ASI report indicated what appears to be the presence of a 10th-century shrine under the mosque. According to the ASI team, the human activity at the site dates back to the 13th century BC. The next few layers date back to the Shunga period (second-first century BC) and the Kushan period. During the early medieval period (11‚Äì12th century), a but short-lived huge structure of nearly 50 metres north‚Äìsouth orientation was constructed. On the remains of this structure, another massive structure was constructed: this structure had at least three structural phases and three successive floors attached with it. The report concluded that it was over the top of this construction that the disputed structure was constructed during the early 16th century. Muslim groups immediately disputed the ASI findings. The Safdar Hashmi Memorial Trust (Sahmat) criticised the report saying that it said that \\"presence of animal bones throughout as well as of the use of 'surkhi' and lime mortar\\" that was found by ASI are all characteristic of Muslim presence \\"that rule out the possibility of a Hindu temple having been there beneath the mosque.\\" The report claimed otherwise on the basis of 'pillar bases' was contested since no pillars were found, and the alleged existence of 'pillar bases' has been debated by archaeologists. Syed Rabe Hasan Nadvi, chairman of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) alleged that ASI failed to mention any evidence of a temple in its interim reports and only revealed it in the final report which was submitted during a time of national tension, making the report highly suspect. The Allahabad High Court, however, upheld the ASI's findings.  Title cases verdict  A land title case on the site was lodged in the Allahabad High Court, the verdicts of which was pronounced on 30 September 2010. In their verdict, the three judges of The Allahabad High Court ruled that the of Ayodhya land be divided into three parts, with one-third going to the Ram Lalla or Infant Lord Rama represented by the Hindu Maha Sabha for the construction of the Ram temple, one-third going to the Islamic Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board and the remaining one-third going to Nirmohi Akhara, a Hindu religious denomination. While the three-judge bench was not unanimous that the disputed structure was constructed after demolition of a temple, it did agree that a temple or a temple structure predated the mosque at the same site.Ram Janm Bhumi Babri Masjid: Gist of Judgments The excavations by the Archaeological Survey of India were heavily used as evidence by the court that the predating structure was a massive Hindu religious building. The five judges Supreme Court bench heard the title dispute cases from August to October 2019. On 9 November 2019, the Supreme Court ordered the land to be handed over to a trust to build the Hindu temple. It also ordered the government to give an alternative five acre plot to the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board to build a mosque, which the government allotted in Dhannipur, Ayodhya. Dhannipur is a village that already has four mosques.

Devine, Laurence D Stephens (1994) The Prosody of Greek Speech, p. 75; Gratwick, A.S. Plautus: Menaechmi, p. 44. or (syllabae) ancipitesAugust B√∂ckh, (1809). √úber die Versmasse des Pindaros, p. 116; C.W. Willink (2010), Collected papers on Greek Tragedy, p. 477.) is a position in a metrical pattern which can be filled by either a long or a short syllable. In general, anceps syllables in words, such as the first syllable of the Greek words (the Greek god of war) or \\"bitter\\", which can be treated by poets as either long or short, can be distinguished from anceps elements or positions in a metrical pattern, which are positions where either a long syllable or a short syllable can be used.M. L. West, \\"Three topics in Greek metre\\", The Classical Quarterly, Vol. 32, No. 2 (1982), pp. 281-297; p. 286. Another distinction can be made between the ordinary anceps positions at the beginning or middle of a line of verse and the phenomenon of brevis in longo, which is when a short syllable at the end of a line counts as long because of the pause which follows.M. L. West, \\"Three topics in Greek metre\\", The Classical Quarterly, Vol. 32, No. 2 (1982), pp. 281-297; p. 287. The word anceps comes from the Latin anceps, ancipitis, meaning \\"two-headed, uncertain, unfixed\\".https://logeion.uchicago.edu/anceps. The usage of the word in a metrical context is, however, relatively modern, and is not found in ancient writers. In Ancient Greek Anceps elements can be found in a variety of metres in Ancient Greek. Anceps elements in the middle or beginning of a line are characteristic of the iambic trimeter of Greek drama. A typical iambic trimeter has the following form (\\"‚Äì\\" = long, \\"u\\" = short, and \\"x\\" = anceps):W. W. Goodwin (1894), Greek Grammar, p. 358. : x ‚Äì u ‚Äì  x ‚Äì u ‚Äì  x ‚Äì u ‚Äì  Except for the last element, an anceps or a longum is sometimes replaced by two short syllables (see Resolution (meter) and Prosody (Greek)#Iambic). In the trochaic metres, on the other hand, the anceps comes at the end of each metron, for example the trochaic tetrameter catalectic: : ‚Äì u ‚Äì x  ‚Äì u ‚Äì x  ‚Äì u ‚Äì x  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  Anceps elements are also found in the Aeolic metres, such as the Sapphic metre, in which the first three lines are as follows, opening with a trochaic metron:W. W. Goodwin (1894), Greek Grammar, p. 365. : ‚Äì u ‚Äì x  ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì  In other Aeolic metres, it is possible for a line to begin with two anceps syllables in succession, for example in the glyconic metre: : x x  ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  u ‚Äì  In such metres it is not allowed for both ancipitia to be short; both in the Aeolic metres and in the eupolidean, the usual form of the base is ‚Äì ‚Äì or ‚Äì u, with u ‚Äì occurring much less often. Martin West argues that this double anceps opening is a relic of an earlier period, also reflected in Sanskrit, when the beginning of a line of poetry had free scansion and only the end was fixed.M. L. West, \\"Three topics in Greek metre\\", The Classical Quarterly, Vol. 32, No. 2 (1982), pp. 281-297; p. 287. West points out that in Ancient Greek, an anceps is not found next to a short element. He argues that in most metres, every 2nd or 3rd element is compulsorily long, and can be considered a locus princeps (principal position). Either before or after a princeps there must be a short element. Between each princeps and the next there can be either an anceps, a short, or two shorts. Some metres, such as the dactylic and anapaestic metres, have no anceps syllables, although they make liberal use of biceps. In Latin In Latin, in the metres of Roman comedy such as those of Plautus, anceps syllables are even more common than in the Greek equivalents. In Plautus the iambic senarius (which is the equivalent of the Greek iambic trimeter) has this form: : x ‚Äì x ‚Äì  x ‚Äì x ‚Äì  x ‚Äì u ‚Äì  The anceps elements, however, are not all equal, since the 2nd and 4th anceps elements, which are always short in Greek verse, tend to be short more frequently than the other ancipites. These two are long in 60% of lines, the 1st and 3rd in 80% of lines, and the 5th in 90% of lines.Gratwick, A. S. (1993), Plautus: Menaechmi, Cambridge University Press, p. 44. In the first two metrons, any of the long or anceps positions can be resolved into two short syllables, but this happens less frequently in anceps positions than in long ones.Moore, Timothy J. (2012), Music in Roman Comedy. Cambridge University Press, p. 220. Other metres which may have anceps positions in Latin are the bacchiac and cretic metres used in cantica (songs) in the plays of Plautus. For example, the bacchiac quaternarius is as follows: : x ‚Äì ‚Äì  x ‚Äì ‚Äì  x ‚Äì ‚Äì  x ‚Äì ‚Äì  and the cretic as follows: : ‚Äì x ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì x ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  The hendecasyllable metre used by Catullus and Martial has the following form, beginning in the same way as a glyconic line (see above): : x x  ‚Äì u u ‚Äì u ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  The first two syllables are usually long, but occasionally in Catullus u ‚Äì or ‚Äì u is found. However, in other metres of Latin poetry, anceps syllables do not occur (except for the usual possibility of brevis in longo at the end of the line). For example, in the dactylic hexameter, much use is made of biceps syllables, but there is no anceps and no resolution: : ‚Äì _uu_  ‚Äì _uu_  ‚Äì _uu_  ‚Äì _uu_  ‚Äì uu  ‚Äì x  There is also a pure form of iambic, used in Catullus 4, which also makes no use of anceps or resolution: : u ‚Äì u ‚Äì  u ‚Äì u ‚Äì  u ‚Äì u ‚Äì  In Arabic Anceps elements are also common in classical Arabic poetry. Unlike Greek metres, in Arabic, an anceps can often be found next to a short element, as in the most common Arabic metre, the ·π¨awƒ´l, of which the half- verse has the following form:Wright, W. (1951). A Grammar of the Arabic Language, vol. II, Cambridge University Press, p. 364. : u ‚Äì x  u ‚Äì x ‚Äì  u ‚Äì x  u ‚Äì u ‚Äì  Another very common metre, the basƒ´·π≠, has this form: : x ‚Äì u ‚Äì  x u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  _uu_ ‚Äì  The eighth element in the Basƒ´·π≠ metre is also theoretically anceps but in practice (in more than 99% of lines) it is always long.Stoetzer, Willem (1982) \\"Some Observations on Quantity in Arabic Metrics\\". Journal of Arabic Literature Vol. 13 (1982), pp. 66-75 In the rajaz metre, which is similar to the Greek iambic trimeter, the first two elements of each metron are anceps, although it is rare for both elements to be short: : x x u ‚Äì  x x u ‚Äì  x x u ‚Äì  In some metres, such as the popular KƒÅmil metre, biceps elements are used instead of anceps: : _uu_ ‚Äì u ‚Äì  _uu_ ‚Äì u ‚Äì  _uu_ ‚Äì u ‚Äì  In Persian In classical Persian poetry, apart from brevis in longo (see below), anceps elements are for the most part found only at the beginning of a line. In mostFor an exception see Elwell-Sutton, L.P. (1976). The Persian Metres. Cambridge University Press, p. 137. metres which begin with two short syllables, the first may be replaced by a long.Elwell-Sutton, L.P. (1976). The Persian Metres. Cambridge University Press, p. 86. Thus the meter khafƒ´f (the most common metre used in Saadi's GolestƒÅn),Thiesen, Finn (1982). A Manual of Classical Persian Prosody, with chapters on Urdu, Karakhanidic and Ottoman prosody. Wiesbaden, p. 261. has the following form: : x u ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì u ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì  In such verses, the anceps is long in about 80% of cases.Elwell-Sutton, L.P. (1976). The Persian Metres. Cambridge University Press, p. 128, 132. The only other place in Persian metre where there is a choice between long and short is in the ruba'i metre used in Omar Khayyam's quatrains, which goes as follows: : ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì _u u_ ‚Äì  x x u ‚Äì  ‚Äì _u u_ ‚Äì  The two ancipitia may be either u ‚Äì or ‚Äì u, but not two shorts or two longs. (The first is slightly more common.)Elwell-Sutton, L.P. (1976). The Persian Metres. Cambridge University Press, p. 135. In Sanskrit In Sanskrit, the classical language of ancient India, in the early period in some metres the first part of the line was very free. For example, epic poems such as the MahƒÅbhƒÅrata were mostly composed in a type of stanza known as the ≈õloka, which developed from the vedic anu·π£·π≠ubh metre. A ≈õloka usually consists of two 16-syllable half-verses of the following pattern: : x x x x  u ‚Äì ‚Äì x  x x x x  u ‚Äì u x  However, this does not quite give the full picture, since the second metron  u ‚Äì ‚Äì x  could sometimes be  u u u x  ,  ‚Äì u u x  ,  ‚Äì, ‚Äì ‚Äì x  or  ‚Äì u ‚Äì x . These variations are known as vipulas. Another restriction is that in the 1st and 3rd metron, the pattern  x u u x  was not permitted (see ≈öloka).Macdonell, Arthur A., A Sanskrit Grammar for Students, Appendix II, p. 232 (Oxford University Press, 3rd edition, 1927) As with Greek, Latin, and Arabic, the last element of every Sanskrit metre is anceps, that is, either long or brevis in longo. Another metre, the tri·π£·π≠ubh, which is commonly used in the Rigveda, the earliest form of Sanskrit, has four 11-syllable lines of the following pattern (the symbol \\",\\" represents a caesura or break between words). Thus the 5th element is an anceps, which if short must be preceded by a word-break, if long it must be followed by one:A. A. Macdonell (1916), A Vedic Grammar for Students, Appendix II, p. 441. : x ‚Äì x ‚Äì , u u ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì x  or : x ‚Äì x ‚Äì ‚Äì , u ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì x  In the high classical period of Sanskrit literature (5th to 12th century CE), a large number of metres were developed which for the most part had no anceps elements. For example, the mandƒÅkrƒÅntƒÅ metre, made popular by KƒÅlidƒÅsa in his poem Meghad≈´ta, has the following form without variation:Deo, Ashwini S. (2007). \\"The Metrical Organization of Classical Sanskrit Verse\\". Journal of Linguistics, Vol. 43, No. 1 (Mar., 2007), pp. 63-114. : ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  u u u u u ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  A third type of Indian metre, commonly used in Prakrit literature, but also sometimes in Sanskrit, is typified by the ƒÅryƒÅ metre. In metres of this type, lines of varying length are made up of feet which can be of any combination of long and short syllables, such as  ‚Äì ‚Äì ,  u u u u ,  ‚Äì u u ,  u u ‚Äì  or  u ‚Äì u , that adds up to the equivalent of four short syllables. Anceps vs. brevis in longo The anceps is distinct from brevis in longo, which refers to the phenomenon whereby a normally short syllable counts as long when used at the end of a line. The possibility of brevis in longo is found universally across all metres, while the anceps is found only in particular verse forms. Also, a brevis in longo is always felt to be long, while the anceps may be short or long freely.

His research on biogenesis paved the way for the downfall of the theory of spontaneous generation, a prevailing idea at the time that organisms develop from inanimate matters, though the final death blow to the idea was dealt by French scientist Louis Pasteur a century later. His most important works were summed up in his book Experiencias Para Servir a La Historia de La Generaci√≥n De Animales y Plantas (Experiences to Serve to the History of the Generation of Animals and Plants), published in 1786. Among his contributions were experimental demonstrations of fertilisation between ova and spermatozoa, and in vitro fertilisation. Biography The statue of Spallanzani in Scandiano has him examining a frog through a magnifying glass. Plaque dedicated to Spallanzani in Portovenere, Italy Dissertazioni di fisica animale e vegetabile, 1780 Spallanzani was born in Scandiano in the modern province of Reggio Emilia to Gianniccolo Spallanzani and Lucia Zigliani. His father, a lawyer by profession, was not impressed with young Spallanzani who spent more time with small animals than studies. With financial support from Vallisnieri Foundation, his father enrolled him to the Jesuit Seminary at age 15. When he was asked to join the order, he refused. Persuaded by his father and with the help of Monsignor Castelvetro, the Bishop of Reggio, he studied law at the University of Bologna, which he gave up soon and turned to science. Here, his famous kinswoman, Laura Bassi, was professor of physics and it is to her influence that his scientific impulse has been usually attributed. With her he studied natural philosophy and mathematics, and gave also great attention to languages, both ancient and modern, but soon abandoned them. It took him a good friend Antonio Vallisnieri jr. to convince his father to drop law as a career and took up academics instead. In 1754, at the age of 25, soon after he was ordained he became professor of logic, metaphysics and Greek in the University of Reggio. In 1763, he was moved to the University of Modena, where he continued to teach with great assiduity and success, but devoted his whole leisure to natural science. There he also served as a priest of the Congregation Beata Vergine and S. Carlo. He declined many offers from other Italian universities and from St Petersburg until 1768, when he accepted the invitation of Maria Theresa to the chair of natural history in the University of Pavia, which was then being reorganized. He also became director of the museum, which he greatly enriched by the collections of his many journeys along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. In June 1768 Spallanzani was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and in 1775 was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1785 he was invited to University of Padua, but to retain his services his sovereign doubled his salary and allowed him leave of absence for a visit to Turkey where he remained nearly a year and made many observations, among which may be noted those of a copper mine in Chalki and of an iron mine at Principi. His return home was almost a triumphal progress: at Vienna he was cordially received by Joseph II and on reaching Pavia he was met with acclamations outside the city gates by the students of the university. During the following year his students exceeded five hundred. While he was travelling in the Balkans and to Constantinople, his integrity in the management of the museum was called in question (he was accused of the theft of specimens from the University's collection to add to his own cabinet of curiosities), with letters written across Europe to damage Spallanzani's reputation. A judicial investigation speedily cleared his honour to the satisfaction of some of his accusers. But Spallanzani got his revenge on his principal accuser, a jealous colleague, by planting a fake specimen of a composite \\"species\\". When his colleague published the remarkable specimen Spallanzani revealed the joke, resulting in wide ridicule and humiliation. In 1796, Spallanzani received an offer for professor at the National Museum of Natural History, France in Paris, but declined due to his age. He died from bladder cancer on 12 February 1799, in Pavia. After his death, his bladder was removed for study by his colleagues, after which it was placed on public display in a museum in Pavia, where it remains to this day. His indefatigable exertions as a traveller, his skill and good fortune as a collector, his brilliance as a teacher and expositor, and his keenness as a controversialist no doubt aid largely in accounting for Spallanzani's exceptional fame among his contemporaries; his letters account for his close relationships with many famed scholars and philosophers, like Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, Lavoisier, and Voltaire. Yet greater qualities were by no means lacking. His life was one of incessant eager questioning of nature on all sides, and his many and varied works all bear the stamp of a fresh and original genius, capable of stating and solving problems in all departments of science‚Äîat one time finding the true explanation of stone skipping (formerly attributed to the elasticity of water) and at another helping to lay the foundations of our modern volcanology and meteorology. Scientific contributions=Spontaneous generation= Spallanzani's first scientific work was in 1765 Saggio di osservazioni microscopiche concernenti il sistema della generazione de' signori di Needham, e Buffon (Essay on microscopic observations regarding the generation system of Messrs. Needham and Buffon) which was the first systemtic rebuttal of the theory of the spontaneous generation. At the time, the microscope was already available to researchers, and using it, the proponents of the theory, Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis, Buffon and John Needham, came to the conclusion that there is a life-generating force inherent to certain kinds of inorganic matter that causes living microbes to create themselves if given sufficient time. Spallanzani's experiment showed that it is not an inherent feature of matter, and that it can be destroyed by an hour of boiling. As the microbes did not re-appear as long as the material was hermetically sealed, he proposed that microbes move through the air and that they could be killed through boiling. Needham argued that experiments destroyed the \\"vegetative force\\" that was required for spontaneous generation to occur. Spallanzani paved the way for research by Louis Pasteur, who defeated the theory of spontaneous generation almost a century later. =Digestion= In his work Dissertationi di fisica animale e vegetale (Dissertation on the physiology of animals and vegetables, in 2 volumes, 1780), Spallanzani was the first to explain the process of digestion in animals. Here he first interpreted the process of digestion, which he proved to be no mere mechanical process of trituration ‚Äì that is, of grinding up the food ‚Äì but one of actual chemical solution, taking place primarily in the stomach, by the action of the gastric juice. =Reproduction= Spallanzani described animal (mammal) reproduction in his Experiencias Para Servir a La Historia de La Generaci√≥n De Animales y Plantas (1786). He was the first to show that fertilisation requires both spermatozoa and an ovum. He was the first to perform in vitro fertilization, with frogs, and an artificial insemination, using a dog. Spallanzani showed that some animals, especially newts, can regenerate some parts of their body if injured or surgically removed. In spite of his scientific background, Spallanzani endorsed preformationism, an idea that organisms develop from their own miniature selves; e.g. animals from minute animals, animalcules. In 1784, he performed filtration experiment in which he successfully separated seminal fluid of frogs ‚Äì a liquid portion and a gelatinous animalcule (spermatozoa) portion. But then he assumed that it was the liquid part which could induce fertilisation. A staunch ovist, he believed that animal form was already developed in the eggs and fertilisation by semen was only an activation for growth. =Echolocation= Spallanzani is also famous for extensive experiments in 1793 on how bats could fly at night to detect objects (including prey) and avoid obstacles, where he concluded that bats do not use their eyes for navigation, but some other sense. He was originally inspired by his observation that tamed barn owl flew properly at night under a dim-lit candle, but struck against the wall when the candle was put out. He managed to capture three wild bats in Scandiono, and performed similar experiment, on which he wrote (on 20 August 1793): A few days later he took two bats and covered their eyes with opaque disc made of birdlime. To his astonishment, both bats flew completely normally. He went further by surgically removing the eyeballs of one bat, which he observed as: He concluded that bats do not need vision for navigation; although he failed to find the reason. At the time other scientists were sceptical and ridiculed his findings. A contemporary of Spallanzani, the Swiss physician and naturalist Louis Jurine, learned of Spallanzani's experiments, investigated the possible mechanism of bat navigation. He discovered that bat flight was disoriented when their ears were plugged. But Spallanzani did not believe that it was about hearing since bats flew very silently. He repeated his experiments by using improved ear plugs using turpentine, wax, pomatum or tinder mixed with water, to find that blinded bats could not navigate without hearing. He was still suspicious that deafness alone was the cause of disoriented flight and that hearing was vital that he conducted some rather painful experiments such as burning and removing the external ear, and piercing through the inner ear. After these operations, he became convinced that hearing was fundamental to normal bat flight, upon which he noted: By then he was too convinced that he suggested the ear was an organ of navigation, writing: The exact scientific principle was discovered only in 1938 by two American biologists Donald Griffin and Robert Galambos. =Fossils= Spallanzani studied the formation and origin of marine fossils found in distant regions of the sea and over the ridge mountains in some regions of Europe, which resulted in the publication in 1755 of a small dissertation, \\"Dissertazione sopra i corpi marino-montani then presented at the meeting the Accademia degli Ipocondriaci di Reggio Emilia\\". Although aligned to one of the trends of his time, which attributed the occurrence of marine fossils on mountains to the natural movement of the sea, not the universal flood, Spallanzani developed his own hypothesis, based on the dynamics of the forces that changed the state of the Earth after God's creation. A few years later, Spallanzani published reports about trips he made to Portovenere, Cerigo Island, and Two Sicilies, addressing important issues such as the discovery of fossil shells within volcanic rocks, human fossils, and the existence of fossils of extinct species. His concern with fossil witness how, in the style of the eighteenth century, Spallanzani integrated studies of the three kingdoms of nature. =Other works= Spallanzani studied and made important descriptions on blood circulation and respiration. In 1777, he gave the name Tardigrada (from Latin meaning \\"slow-moving\\") for the phylum of animal group comprising one of the most durable extremophiles still to this day. In 1788 he visited Vesuvius and the volcanoes of the Lipari Islands and Sicily, and embodied the results of his researches in a large work (Viaggi alle due Sicilie ed in alcune parti dell'Appennino), published four years later. Honours Spallanzani was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of London. He was member of Prussian Academy of Sciences, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and G√∂ttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities.

Alabama, 357 U.S. 449 (1958), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court. Alabama sought to prevent the NAACP from conducting further business in the state. After the circuit court issued a restraining order, the state issued a subpoena for various records, including the NAACP's membership lists. The Supreme Court ruled that Alabama's demand for the lists had violated the right of due process guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Facts In 1956, the Attorney General of Alabama, John Patterson, brought a suit to the State Circuit Court of Montgomery, Alabama, challenging the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) for violation of a state statute requiring foreign corporations to qualify before doing business in the state. The NAACP, a nonprofit membership corporation based in New York, had not complied with the statute, as it believed it was exempt. The state suit sought both to prevent the Association from conducting further business within the state and, indeed, to remove it from the state. Referring to the Association's involvement with the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955 and its role in funding and providing legal assistance to black students' seeking admission to the state university, the suit charged that the Association was \\". . . causing irreparable injury to the property and civil rights of the residents and citizens of the State of Alabama for which criminal prosecution and civil actions at law afford no adequate relief . . . .\\" On the day this suit was filed, the circuit court agreed to issue an ex parte order restraining the Association from conducting business in the state or taking steps to qualify it to do so. The Association, represented throughout by Robert L. Carter of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, responded by moving to dissolve the order on the grounds that its activities within the state did not require its qualification under the statute and that the state's suit was intended to violate its rights to freedom of speech and of assembly as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States. Before a hearing date was set, the state issued a subpoena for much of the Association's records, including bank statements and leases, but most notably the names and addresses of the \\"agents\\" or \\"members\\" of the Association in Alabama. In its response to the lawsuit, the Association admitted that it was in breach of the statute and offered to obtain qualification to continue business if that part of the ex parte order was lifted. Because the Association did not comply with the order to produce its records, that motion was denied and the Association was held in contempt and fined $10,000. The contempt order allowed for the reduction or remission of the fine if the production order was complied with within five days, after which the fine would be raised to $100,000. Contending that the State could not constitutionally force disclosure of the records, the Association moved to dismiss the contempt judgment once more. According to Alabama case law, however, a petitioner could not seek a hearing or to dissolve an order until it purged itself of contempt. Lead attorney on NAACP v. Alabama, Judge Robert L. Carter (left), with the dean of Georgetown University Law Center, William TreanorThe United States Supreme Court reversed the first contempt judgment. The Alabama Supreme Court then claimed the U.S. Supreme Court had relied on a \\"mistaken premise\\" and reinstated the contempt judgment, which the U.S. Supreme Court reversed again. The NAACP moved to try the case on the merits; this motion was denied and again appealed up to the U.S. Supreme Court, which remanded the case to Alabama, and ordered the Federal district court to try the case on the merits if the Alabama court system continued to refuse to do so. The Alabama state circuit court finally heard the case on the merits, and decided the NAACP had violated Alabama law and ordered it to stop doing business in the state; the Alabama appeals courts upheld this judgment, refusing to hear the NAACP's appeals on Constitutional grounds. Finally, the fourth time the case was heard by the U.S. Supreme Court, it granted certiorari and decided the case, itself, on the merits rather than remand the case to the balking Alabama court system, which had taken five years to get this far. Judgment In an opinion delivered by Justice John Marshall Harlan II, the Supreme Court decided in favor of the petitioners, holding that \\"Immunity from state scrutiny of petitioner's membership lists is here so related to the right of petitioner's members to pursue their lawful private interests privately and to associate freely with others in doing so as to come within the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment\\" and, further, that freedom to associate with organizations dedicated to the \\"advancement of beliefs and ideas\\" is an inseparable part of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The action of the state's obtaining the names of the Association's membership would likely interfere with the free association of its members, so the state's interest in obtaining the records was superseded by the constitutional rights of the petitioners..

He was a pioneer scientist in the study of cellular respiration, a biochemical process in living cells that extracts energy from food and oxygen and makes it available to drive the processes of life. He is best known for his discoveries of two important sequences of chemical reactions that take place in the cells of humans and many other organisms, namely the citric acid cycle and the urea cycle. The former, often eponymously known as the \\"Krebs cycle\\", is the key sequence of metabolic reactions that provides energy in the cells of humans and other oxygen-respiring organisms; and its discovery earned Krebs a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1953. With Hans Kornberg, he also discovered the glyoxylate cycle, which is a slight variation of the citric acid cycle found in plants, bacteria, protists, and fungi. Krebs died in 1981 in Oxford, where he had spent 13 years of his career from 1954 until his retirement in 1967 at the University of Oxford.  Biography = Early life and education = Krebs was born in Hildesheim, Germany, to Georg Krebs, an ear, nose, and throat surgeon, and Alma Krebs (n√©e Davidson). He descended from Jewish- Silesian ancestry and was the middle of three children, older sister Elisabeth and younger brother Wolfgang. Krebs attended the famous old Gymnasium Andreanum in his home town. Near the end of World War I, in September 1918, six months short of completing his secondary school education, he was conscripted into the Imperial German Army. He was allowed to take an emergency examination for his high school diploma, which he passed with such a high score that he suspected the examiners of being \\"unduly lenient and sympathetic\\". With the end of the war two months later, his conscription ended. Krebs decided to follow his father's profession and entered the University of G√∂ttingen in December 1918 to study medicine. In 1919 he transferred to the University of Freiburg. In 1923 he published his first scientific paper on a tissue staining technique. He did this work under the guidance of Wilhelm von Mollendorf starting it in 1920. He completed his medical course in December 1923. To obtain a Doctor of Medicine degree, and a medical license, he spent one year at the Third Medical Clinic in the University of Berlin. By then he had turned his professional goal from becoming a practising physician to becoming a medical researcher, particularly in biochemistry. In 1924 he studied at the Department of Chemistry at the Pathological Institute of the Charit√© Hospital, in Berlin, for training in chemistry and biochemistry. He earned his MD degree in 1925 from the University of Hamburg. = Career = In 1926 Krebs joined Otto Heinrich Warburg as a research assistant at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology in Dahlem, Berlin. He was paid a modest 4800 marks per year. After four years in 1930, with 16 publications to his credit, his mentor Warburg urged him to move on and he took up the position of Assistant in the Department of Medicine at the Municipal Hospital in Altona (now part of Hamburg). The next year he moved to the Medical Clinic of the University of Freiburg. At Freiburg he was in charge of about 40 patients, and was at liberty to do his own research. Before a year was over at Freiburg, he, with research student Kurt Henseleit, published their discovery of the ornithine cycle of urea synthesis, which is the metabolic pathway for urea formation. It is now known as the urea cycle, and is sometimes also referred to as the Krebs‚ÄìHenseleit cycle. Together they also developed a complex aqueous solution (a buffer), or perfusion ex vivo, for studying blood flow in arteries, which is now called the Krebs‚ÄìHenseleit buffer.) In 1932 he published the basic chemical reactions of the urea cycle, which established his scientific reputation. Krebs's life as a respected German scientist came to an abrupt halt in 1933 because of his Jewish ancestry. With the rise of Hitler's Nazi Party to power, Germany decreed the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, which decreed the removal of all non-Germans, and anti-Nazis, from professional occupations. Krebs received his official dismissal from his job in April 1933, and his service was terminated on 1 July 1933. An admirer, Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins at the University of Cambridge, immediately came to his rescue, and persuaded the university to recruit Krebs to work with him in the Department of Biochemistry. By July 1933 he was settled in Cambridge with financial support from the Rockefeller Foundation. Although Germany restricted him to bringing only his personal belongings, he was fortunate that the government agents allowed him to take his equipment and research samples to England. They proved to be pivotal to his later discoveries, especially the manometer developed by Warburg specifically for the measurement of oxygen consumption in thin slices of tissues; it was the basis for his research. He was appointed as Demonstrator in biochemistry in 1934 and in 1935 the University of Sheffield offered him a post of Lecturer in Pharmacology, with a more spacious laboratory and double the salary. He worked there for 19 years. University of Sheffield opened a Department of Biochemistry, now Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, in 1938 and Krebs became its first Head, and eventually a Professor in 1945. Krebs took over the running of the Sorby Research Institute in 1943. In 1944, the British Medical Research Council established the MRC Unit for Cell Metabolism Research at Sheffield, and Krebs was appointed the Director. With this his laboratory became so large that the locals jokingly nicknamed it \\"Krebs's Empire\\". He moved with his MRC unit to the University of Oxford in 1954 as Whitley Professor of Biochemistry, the post he held till his retirement in 1967. The editorial board of Biochemical Journal extended their good wishes on his retirement, but in return he promised to keep them busy, by producing scientific papers. He continued his research, and took his MRC unit to the Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford. From there he published over 100 research papers. = Personal life and death= Krebs with wife in Stockholm in 1953 Krebs met Margaret Cicely Fieldhouse (30 October 1913 ‚Äì May 1993) when he moved to Sheffield in 1935. They married on 22 March 1938. Krebs later described his life in Sheffield as \\"19 happy years\\". They had two sons, Paul (born 1939) and John (born 1945), and a daughter, Helen (born 1942). John (Sir John Krebs, and later Baron Krebs) became a renowned ornithologist, Professor at the University of Oxford, Principal of Jesus College, Oxford, and Member of the British House of Lords. After a brief illness, Krebs died on 22 November 1981 in Oxford.  Achievements = Urea cycle (Krebs‚ÄìHenseleit cycle) = In 1932 Krebs worked out the outlines of the urea cycle with a medical student Kurt Henseleit at the university of Freiburg. While working at the Medical Clinic of the University of Freiburg, Krebs met Kurt Henseleit, with whom he investigated the chemical process of urea formation. In 1904, two Germans A. Kossel and H. D. Dakin had shown that arginine could be hydrolysed by the enzyme arginase to form ornithine and urea in inorganic reaction. Based on this reaction, Krebs and Henseleit postulated that in living cells, similar reaction could occur, and that ornithine and citrulline could be the intermediate reactions. Krebs started working on the possible method for the synthesis of arginine. Using his Warburg manometer, he mixed a slice of liver with purified ornithine and citrulline. He found that citrulline acted as a catalyst in the metabolic reactions of urea from ammonia and carbon dioxide. He and Henseleit published their discovery in 1932. Thus the urea cycle (or \\"ornithine cycle\\") was established, and it was the first metabolic cycle to be discovered. = Citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle) = At the University of Sheffield, Krebs and William Johnson investigated cellular respiration by which oxygen was consumed to produce energy from the breakdown of glucose. Krebs had earlier suggested to Warburg while they worked together in Germany that by using a manometer it could be possible to detect the oxygen consumption and identify the chemical reaction in glucose metabolism. Warburg had flatly rejected the idea. In Sheffield Krebs vigorously worked to identify a possible chemical reaction and came up with numerous hypothetical pathways. Using the manometer he tested those hypotheses one by one. One hypothesis involving succinate, fumarate, and malate proved to be useful because all these molecules increased oxygen consumption in the pigeon breast muscle. In 1937 German biochemists Franz Koop and Carl Martinus had demonstrated a series of reactions using citrate that produced oxaloacetate. Krebs realised that these molecules could be the missing intermediates for such reaction. After four months of experimental works to fill in the gaps, Krebs and Johnson succeeded in establishing the sequence of the chemical cycle, which they called the \\"citric acid cycle\\". It is also known as the \\"Krebs cycle\\" or \\"tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle\\". Krebs sent a short manuscript account of the discovery to Nature on 10 June 1937. On 14 June he received a rejection letter from the editor, saying that the journal had \\"already sufficient letters to fill correspondence columns for seven or eight weeks\\", and encouraging Krebs to \\"submit it for early publication to another periodical.\\" Krebs immediately prepared a longer version titled \\"The Role of Citric Acid in Intermediate Metabolism in Animal Tissues\\", which he sent to the Dutch journal Enzymologia after two weeks and was published in two months. It was followed by a series of papers in different journals. = Glyoxylate cycle = Krebs continued to add more details to his citric acid cycle. The discovery of acetyl-CoA in 1947 by Fritz Albert Lipmann was another major contribution. However, this new discovery posed a problem in his classic reaction. In 1957 he, with Hans Kornberg, found that there were additional crucial enzymes. One was malate synthase, which condenses acetate with glyoxylate to form malate, and the other was isocitrate lyase, which provides glyoxylate for the reaction by cleaving it from isocitrate. These two reactions did not follow the normal citric acid cycle, and hence the pathway was named the glyoxylate bypass of the citric acid cycle, but is now known as the glyoxylate cycle.  Honours and awards  Krebs with Clementine Churchill and Frits Zernike in Stockholm in 1953 Krebs became a naturalised British citizen in 1939. He was elected Fellow of Trinity College, Oxford, 1954‚Äì1967. He was elected to the Royal Society in 1947. In 1953 he received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his \\"discovery of the citric acid cycle.\\" (He shared the Nobel Prize with Fritz Lipmann.) For the same reason he was given the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research in 1953. The Royal Society awarded him its Royal Medal in 1954, and Copley Medal in 1961. In 1958 he received the Gold Medal of the Netherlands Society for Physics, Medical Science and Surgery. He was knighted in 1958 and was elected Honorary Fellow of Girton College, Cambridge University in 1979. He was the Original Member of the Society for General Microbiology, which conferred him Honorary Membership in 1980. He received an honorary doctorate from 21 universities. In July 2015, Krebs's Nobel Prize medal was auctioned off for ¬£225,000 (around $351,225). The proceeds were used to found the Sir Hans Krebs Trust, which provides funding for doctoral students in the biomedical field and support chemists who had to flee their home countries.  Legacy  The University of Oxford had a building named Hans Krebs Tower, which was occupied by the Department of Biochemistry. In 2008 a new building for the Department of Biochemistry was constructed, on which a plaque was placed on 20 May 2013 by the Association of Jewish Refugees. The plaque was unveiled by John, Lord Krebs, and the inscription reads: The University of Sheffield has The Krebs Institute, founded in 1988. It is a research centre covering interdisciplinary programmes in biochemical research. In 1990 the Federation of European Biochemical Societies instituted the Sir Hans Krebs Lecture and Medal, which was endowed by the Lord Rank Centre for Research. It is awarded for outstanding achievements in biochemistry and molecular biology. The Society of Friends of Hannover Medical School gives the Sir Hans Krebs Prize, which is worth 10,000 euros. The Biochemical Society offers Krebs Memorial Scholarship to a postgraduate (PhD) student working in biochemistry or an allied biomedical science at any British university. As of 2014, the scholarship is worth ¬£18,500 and is given for a year, but is extendable up to three years.

BoxtopAmbush! is a man-to-man wargame developed by Avalon Hill. It was released under Avalon's Victory Games label and was developed by Eric Lee Smith and John Butterfield. It has been out of print since Avalon Hill was disbanded in 1998. Ambush! was innovative when it was released in 1983 since it was exclusively designed for single player play. Up to that point, wargames generally required at least two players. This was necessary since a player always had to play and control the opponent. Ambush! solved this problem by having the game scenario itself control the opponent. It accomplished this via tables, charts and a \\"paragraph book\\" which the player referred to see how the opponent was reacting. Having the scenario dictate the actions of the opponent had another advantage: perfectly hiding the enemy. In all previous board based wargames, chits or markers had to be placed on the board representing enemy units. Some chits contained question marks or otherwise hid what was actually on the space, but the opposing player knew where likely areas for the enemy were. With Ambush!, the enemy had no markers on the board at all until they became visible (usually by attacking the player). One drawback of Ambush!'s design was that it was difficult for players to create their own scenarios. Since each scenario had its own complex set of charts and tables, each cross- referenced to sections in the paragraph book, creating a scenario for the game from scratch could be a daunting undertaking. Players, then, were usually required to purchase Avalon Hill's expansion modules in order to play additional scenarios. Ambush! could also be played with more than one player, with players playing in different squads or controlling different soldiers.  Expansions  Ambush! spawned several expansion modules: * Move Out (1984) * Purple Heart (1985) * Silver Star (1987) There was also a Japanese theatre version of Ambush! called Battle Hymn, which had one expansion module called Leatherneck. Additionally, a solitaire game based on Ambush! called Open Fire! was released by Victory Games which put the player in command of US tanks in WW II. It was less successful and had a less elegant design. There was, finally, a two-player version of Ambush! called Shell Shock released in 1990. Computer versions There have been a number of literal translations of Ambush! to the computer, including a cyberbox moduledownload of cyberbox module as well as at least one version for the VASSAL game engine.download of VASSAL module Reception In 1984, Ambush! won the Origins Award for Best 20th Century Boardgame of 1983. Reviews * Casus Belli #22 (Oct 1984) Legacy While not the first boxed solitaire board wargame to be produced (Avalon Hill's B-17, Queen of the Skies had preceded it in 1983), Ambush! was probably the most successful. While the additional modules are testament to this successful design, the concept also appears to have been validated by Ambush!, as a fair number of other purpose-designed solitaire games (as opposed to two player games that \\"could\\" be played solitaire) followed it shortly after.

Southern Pacific Railroad Company, 118 U.S. 394 (1886), is a corporate law case of the United States Supreme Court concerning taxation of railroad properties. The case is most notable for a headnote stating that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment grants constitutional protections to corporations. The case arose when several railroads refused to follow a California state law that gave less favorable tax treatment to some assets owned by corporations as compared to assets owned by individuals. The Court's opinions in earlier cases such as Dartmouth College v. Woodward had recognized that corporations were entitled to some of the protections of the Constitution. Associate Justice John Marshall Harlan's majority opinion held for the railroads, but his opinion did not address the Equal Protection Clause. However, a headnote written by the Reporter of Decisions and approved by Chief Justice Morrison Waite stated that the Supreme Court justices unanimously believed that the Equal Protection Clause did grant constitutional protections to corporations. The headnote marked the first occasion on which the Supreme Court indicated that the Equal Protection Clause granted constitutional protections to corporations as well as to natural persons. Facts At the California Constitutional Convention of 1878‚Äì79, the state legislature drew up a new constitution that denied railroads \\"the right to deduct the amount of their debts [i.e., mortgages] from the taxable value of their property, a right which was given to individuals.\\". Southern Pacific Railroad Company refused to pay taxes under these new changes. The taxpaying railroads challenged this law, based on a conflicting federal statute of 1866 which gave them privileges inconsistent with state taxation (14 Stat. 292, ¬ß¬ß 1, 2, 3, 11, 18). San Mateo County, along with neighboring counties, filed suit against the railroads to recoup the massive losses in tax revenue stemming from Southern Pacific's refusal to pay. After hearing arguments in San Mateo County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Company, the California Supreme Court sided with the county. The Supreme Court of the United States issued an opinion consolidating three separate cases: Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Company, California v. Central Pacific Railroad Company, and California v. Southern Pacific Railroad Company. =Headnote= Bancroft Davis, the Reporter of Decisions and former president of Newburgh and New York Railway The headnote, which is \\"not the work of the Court, but is simply the work of the Reporter, giving his understanding of the decision, prepared for the convenience of the profession\\",United States v. Detroit Timber & Lumber Co., , (Syllabus). was written by the Reporter of Decisions, former president of the Newburgh and New York Railway Company J.C. Bancroft Davis. He said the following: > One of the points made and discussed at length in the brief of counsel for > defendants in error was that 'corporations are persons within the meaning of > the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.' Before > argument, Mr. Chief Justice Waite said: The court does not wish to hear > argument on the question whether the provision in the Fourteenth Amendment > to the Constitution, which forbids a State to deny to any person within its > jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws, applies to these > corporations. We are all of the opinion that it does.According to the > official court Syllabus in the United States Reports, Santa Clara County v. > Southern Pacific Railroad Company . So the headnote was a reporting by the Reporter of Decisions of the Chief Justice's interpretation of the Justices' opinions. But the issue of applicability of \\"Equal Protection to any persons\\" to the railroads was not addressed in the decision of the Court in the case. Before publication in United States Reports, Davis wrote a letter to Chief Justice Morrison Waite, dated May 26, 1886, to make sure his headnote was correct: > Dear Chief Justice, I have a memorandum in the California Cases Santa Clara > County v. Southern Pacific &c; As follows. In opening the Court stated that > it did not wish to hear argument on the question whether the Fourteenth > Amendment applies to such corporations as are parties in these suits. All > the Judges were of the opinion that it does.. Waite replied: > I think your mem. in the California Railroad Tax cases expresses with > sufficient accuracy what was said before the argument began. I leave it with > you to determine whether anything need be said about it in the report > inasmuch as we avoided meeting the constitutional question in the decision. C. Peter Magrath, who discovered the exchange while researching Morrison R. Waite: The Triumph of Character, writes \\"In other words, to the Reporter fell the decision which enshrined the declaration in the United States Reports...had Davis left it out, Santa Clara County v. Southern Pac. R. Co. would have been lost to history among thousands of uninteresting tax cases.\\". At the same time, the correspondence makes clear that the headnote does reflect the Court's thinking, at least before hearing any arguments to the contrary. Author Jack Beatty wrote about the lingering questions as to how the reporter's note reflected a quotation that was absent from the opinion itself. > Why did the chief justice issue his dictum? Why did he leave it up to Davis > to include it in the headnotes? After Waite told him that the Court > 'avoided' the issue of corporate personhood, why did Davis include it? Why, > indeed, did he begin his headnote with it? The opinion made plain that the > Court did not decide the corporate personality issue and the subsidiary > equal protection issue.. =Defense argument= While the decision of the Court did not rest on the Fourteenth Amendment, an argument on this ground had been delivered by the defense: > That the provisions of the Constitution and laws of California in respect to > the assessment for taxation of the property of railway corporations > operating railroads in more than one county, are in violation of the > Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution insofar as they require the > assessment of their property at its full money value without making > deduction, as in the case of railroads operated in one county and of other > corporations and of natural persons, for the value of the mortgages covering > the property assessed, thus imposing upon the defendant unequal burdens, and > to that extent denying to it the equal protection of the laws. Judgment A unanimous decision, written by Justice Harlan, ruled on the matter of fences, holding that the state of California illegally included the fences running beside the tracks in its assessment of the total value of the railroad's property. As a result, the county could not collect taxes from Southern Pacific that it was not allowed to collect in the first place.118 US Reports 412-17. This meant that the more significant question of the Equal Protection Clause was never actually addressed. Significance Thus the Supreme Court's actual decision never hinged on the equal protection claims. Nevertheless, the case has been allowed to have clear constitutional consequences, as it has been subsequently cited as affirming the protection of corporations under the Fourteenth Amendment. At the very least, this is a unusual exception to the normal understanding of the workings of the Court's rule of stare decisis ‚Äì the reliance on precedent. It is an instance in which a statement which is neither part of the ruling of the Court, nor part of the opinion of a majority or dissenting minority of the Court has been cited as precedent in subsequent decisions of the Court. In his dissent in the 1938 case of Connecticut General Life Insurance Company v. Johnson, Justice Hugo Black wrote > in 1886, this Court in the case of Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific > Railroad, decided for the first time that the word 'person' in the amendment > did in some instances include corporations. [...] The history of the > amendment proves that the people were told that its purpose was to protect > weak and helpless human beings and were not told that it was intended to > remove corporations in any fashion from the control of state governments. > [...] The language of the amendment itself does not support the theory that > it was passed for the benefit of corporations.Connecticut General Life > Insurance Company v.

When Bu√±uel died at age 83, his obituary in The New York Times called him \\"an iconoclast, moralist, and revolutionary who was a leader of avant-garde surrealism in his youth and a dominant international movie director half a century later\\". His first picture, Un Chien Andalou‚Äîmade in the silent era‚Äîis still viewed regularly throughout the world and retains its power to shock the viewer, and his last film, That Obscure Object of Desire‚Äîmade 48 years later‚Äîwon him Best Director awards from the National Board of Review and the National Society of Film Critics. Writer Octavio Paz called Bu√±uel's work \\"the marriage of the film image to the poetic image, creating a new reality...scandalous and subversive\\". Often associated with the surrealist movement of the 1920s, Bu√±uel created films from the 1920s through the 1970s. Having worked in Europe and North America, and in French and Spanish, Bu√±uel's films also spanned various genres. Despite this variety, filmmaker John Huston believed that, regardless of genre, a Bu√±uel film is so distinctive as to be instantly recognizable, or, as Ingmar Bergman put it, \\"Bu√±uel nearly always made Bu√±uel films\\". Seven of Bu√±uel's films are included in Sight & Sound's 2012 critics' poll of the top 250 films of all time. Fifteen of his films are included in the They Shoot Pictures, Don't They? list of the 1,000 greatest films of all time, second only to Jean-Luc Godard, with sixteen, and he ranks number 13 on their list of the top 250 directors. Early years Calanda, Spain Bu√±uel was born on 22 February 1900 in Calanda, a small town in the Aragon region of Spain. His father was Leonardo Bu√±uel, also a native of Calanda, who had left home at age 14 to start a hardware business in Havana, Cuba, ultimately amassing a fortune and returning home to Calanda at age 43 (1898). He married the 18-year old daughter of the only innkekeper in Calanda, Mar√≠a Portol√©s Cerezuela. The oldest of seven children, Luis had two brothers, Alfonso and Leonardo, and four sisters: Alicia, Concepci√≥n, Margarita and Mar√≠a. He would later describe his birthplace by saying that in Calanda, \\"the Middle Ages lasted until World War I\\".Bu√±uel, Luis. My Last Sigh. Trans. Abigail Israel. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2003. . page 8. When Bu√±uel was four and a half months old, the family moved to Zaragoza, where they were one of the wealthiest families in town. In Zaragoza, Bu√±uel received a strict Jesuit education at the private Colegio del Salvador, starting at age 7 and continuing for the next seven years. After being kicked and insulted by the study hall proctor before a final exam, Bu√±uel refused to return to the school. He told his mother he had been expelled, which was not true; in fact, he had received the highest marks on his world history exam.Bu√±uel, Luis. My Last Sigh. Trans. Abigail Israel. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2003. . page 30. Bu√±uel finished the last two years of his high school education at the local public school, graduating at age 16. Even as a child, Bu√±uel was something of a cinematic showman; friends from that period described productions in which Bu√±uel would project shadows on a screen using a magic lantern and a bedsheet. He also excelled at boxing and playing the violin. In his youth, Bu√±uel was deeply religious, serving at Mass and taking Communion every day, until, at the age of 16, he grew disgusted with what he perceived as the illogicality of the Church, along with its power and wealth. Federico Garc√≠a Lorca al piano. Granada. 1919. Colecci√≥n Fundaci√≥n Federico Garc√≠a Lorca In 1917, he attended the University of Madrid, first studying agronomy then industrial engineering and finally switching to philosophy. He developed very close relationships with painter Salvador Dal√≠ and poet Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, among other important Spanish creative artists living in the Residencia de Estudiantes, with the three friends forming the nucleus of the Spanish Surrealist avant-garde, and becoming known as members of \\"La Generaci√≥n del 27\\". Bu√±uel was especially taken with Lorca, later writing in his autobiography: \\"We liked each other instantly. Although we seemed to have little in common‚ÄîI was a redneck from Aragon, and he an elegant Andalusian‚Äîwe spent most of our time together... We used to sit on the grass in the evenings behind the Residencia (at that time, there were vast open spaces reaching to the horizon), and he would read me his poems. He read slowly and beautifully, and through him I began to discover a wholly new world.\\" Bu√±uel's relationship with Dal√≠ was somewhat more troubled, being tinged with jealousy over the growing intimacy between Dal√≠ and Lorca and resentment over Dal√≠'s early success as an artist. Bu√±uel's interest in films was intensified by a viewing of Fritz Lang's Der m√ºde Tod: \\"I came out of the Vieux Colombier [theater] completely transformed. Images could and did become for me the true means of expression. I decided to devote myself to the cinema\\". At age 72, Bu√±uel had not lost his enthusiasm for this film, asking the octogenarian Lang for his autograph. Career=Early French period (1925‚Äì1930)= Jean Epstein, Bu√±uel's first film collaborator In 1925 Bu√±uel moved to Paris, where he began work as a secretary in an organization called the International Society of Intellectual Cooperation. He also became actively involved in cinema and theater, going to the movies as often as three times a day. Through these interests, he met a number of influential people, including the pianist Ricardo Vi√±es, who was instrumental in securing Bu√±uel's selection as artistic director of the Dutch premiere of Manuel de Falla's puppet-opera El retablo de maese Pedro in 1926. He decided to enter the film industry and enrolled in a private film school run by Jean Epstein and some associates. At that time, Epstein was one of the most celebrated commercial directors working in France, his films being hailed as \\"the triumph of impressionism in motion, but also the triumph of the modern spirit\\". Before long, Bu√±uel was working for Epstein as an assistant director on Mauprat (1926) and La chute de la maison Usher (1928), and also for Mario Nalpas on La Sir√®ne des Tropiques (1927), starring Josephine Baker. He appeared on screen in a small part as a smuggler in Jacques Feyder's Carmen (1926). When Bu√±uel derisively rejected Epstein's demand that he assist Epstein's mentor, Abel Gance, who was at the time working on the film Napol√©on, Epstein dismissed him angrily, saying \\"How can a little asshole like you dare to talk that way about a great director like Gance?\\" then added \\"You seem rather surrealist. Beware of surrealists, they are crazy people.\\" After parting with Epstein, Bu√±uel worked as film critic for La Gaceta Literaria (1927) and Les Cahiers d'Art (1928). In the periodicals L'Amic de les Arts and La gaseta de les Arts, he and Dal√≠ carried on a series of \\"call and response\\" essays on cinema and theater, debating such technical issues as segmentation, d√©coupage, the insert shot and rhythmic editing. He also collaborated with the celebrated writer Ram√≥n G√≥mez de la Serna on the script for what he hoped would be his first film, \\"a story in six scenes\\" called Los caprichos. Through his involvement with Gaceta Literaria, he helped establish Madrid's first cine-club and served as its inaugural chairman. Un Chien Andalou (1929) Salvador Dal√≠ After his apprenticeship with Epstein, Bu√±uel shot and directed a 16-minute short, Un Chien Andalou, with Salvador Dal√≠. The film, financed by Bu√±uel's mother, consists of a series of startling images of a Freudian nature, starting with a woman's eyeball being sliced open with a razor blade. Un Chien Andalou was enthusiastically received by the burgeoning French surrealist movement of the time and continues to be shown regularly in film societies to this day. It has been called \\"the most famous short film ever made\\" by critic Roger Ebert. The script was written in six days at Dal√≠'s home in Cadaqu√©s. In a letter to a friend written in February 1929, Bu√±uel described the writing process: \\"We had to look for the plot line. Dal√≠ said to me, 'I dreamed last night of ants swarming around in my hands', and I said, 'Good Lord, and I dreamed that I had sliced somebody or other's eye. There's the film, let's go and make it.'\\" In deliberate contrast to the approach taken by Jean Epstein and his peers, which was to never leave anything in their work to chance, with every aesthetic decision having a rational explanation and fitting clearly into the whole, Bu√±uel and Dal√≠ made a cardinal point of eliminating all logical associations. In Bu√±uel's words: \\"Our only rule was very simple: no idea or image that might lend itself to a rational explanation of any kind would be accepted. We had to open all doors to the irrational and keep only those images that surprised us, without trying to explain why\\". It was Bu√±uel's intention to outrage the self- proclaimed artistic vanguard of his youth, later saying: \\"Historically the film represents a violent reaction against what in those days was called 'avant-garde,' which was aimed exclusively at artistic sensibility and the audience's reason.\\" Against his hopes and expectations, the film was a popular success with the very audience he had wanted to insult, leading Bu√±uel to exclaim in exasperation, \\"What can I do about the people who adore all that is new, even when it goes against their deepest convictions, or about the insincere, corrupt press, and the inane herd that saw beauty or poetry in something which was basically no more than a desperate impassioned call for murder?\\" Although Un Chien Andalou is a silent film, during the original screening (attended by the elite of the Parisian art world), Bu√±uel played a sequence of phonograph records which he switched manually while keeping his pockets full of stones with which to pelt anticipated hecklers. After the premiere, Bu√±uel and Dal√≠ were granted formal admittance to the tight-knit community of Surrealists, led by poet Andr√© Breton. L'Age d'Or (1930) Marie-Laure de Noailles was a prominent patron of avant-garde artists, who received L'Age d'Or as a birthday gift from her husband, Charles Late in 1929, on the strength of Un Chien Andalou, Bu√±uel and Dal√≠ were commissioned to make another short film by Marie-Laurie and Charles de Noailles, owners of a private cinema on the Place des √âtats-Unis and financial supporters of productions by Jacques Manuel, Man Ray and Pierre Chenal. At first, the intent was that the new film be around the same length as Un Chien, only this time with sound. But by mid-1930, the film had grown segmentally to an hour's duration. Anxious that it was over twice as long as planned and at double the budget, Bu√±uel offered to trim the film and cease production, but Noailles gave him the go-ahead to continue the project. The film, entitled L'Age d'Or, was begun as a second collaboration with Dal√≠, but, while working on the scenario, the two had a falling out; Bu√±uel, who at the time had strong leftist sympathies, desired a deliberate undermining of all bourgeois institutions, while Dal√≠, who eventually supported the Spanish fascist Francisco Franco and various figures of the European aristocracy, wanted merely to cause a scandal through the use of various scatological and anti- Catholic images. The friction between them was exacerbated when, at a dinner party in Cadaqu√©s, Bu√±uel tried to throttle Dal√≠'s girlfriend, Gala, the wife of Surrealist poet Paul √âluard. In consequence, Dal√≠ had nothing to do with the actual shooting of the film. During the course of production, Bu√±uel worked around his technical ignorance by filming mostly in sequence and using nearly every foot of film that he shot. Bu√±uel invited friends and acquaintances to appear, for nothing, in the film; for example, anyone who owned a tuxedo or a party frock got a part in the salon scene. L'Age d'Or was publicly proclaimed by Dal√≠ as a deliberate attack on Catholicism, and this precipitated a much larger scandal than Un Chien Andalou. One early screening was taken over by members of the fascist League of Patriots and the Anti- Jewish Youth Group, who hurled purple ink at the screen and then vandalised the adjacent art gallery, destroying a number of valuable surrealist paintings. The film was banned by the Parisian police \\"in the name of public order\\". The de Noailles, both Catholics, were threatened with excommunication by The Vatican because of the film's blasphemous final scene (which visually links Jesus Christ with the writings of the Marquis de Sade), so they made the decision in 1934 to withdraw all prints from circulation, and L'Age d'Or was not seen again until 1979, after their deaths, although a print was smuggled to England for private viewing. The furor was so great that the premiere of another film financed by the de Noailles, Jean Cocteau's The Blood of a Poet, had to be delayed for over two years until outrage over L'Age d'Or had died down. To make matters worse, Charles de Noailles was forced to withdraw his membership from the Jockey Club. Concurrent with the succ√®s de scandale, both Bu√±uel and the film's leading lady, Lya Lys, received offers of interest from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and traveled to Hollywood at the studio's expense. While in the United States, Bu√±uel associated with other celebrity expatriates including Sergei Eisenstein, Josef Von Sternberg, Jacques Feyder, Charles Chaplin and Bertolt Brecht. All that was required of Bu√±uel by his loose-ended contract with MGM was that he \\"learn some good American technical skills\\", but, after being ushered off the first set he visited because the star, Greta Garbo, did not welcome intruders, he decided to stay at home most of the time and only show up to collect his paycheck. His only enduring contribution to MGM came when he served as an extra in La Fruta Amarga, a Spanish-language remake of Min and Bill. When, after a few months at the studio, he was asked to watch rushes of Lili Damita to gauge her Spanish accent, he refused and sent a message to studio boss Irving Thalberg stating that he was there as a Frenchman, not a Spaniard, and he \\"didn't have time to waste listening to one of the whores\\". He was back in Spain shortly thereafter. =Spain (1931‚Äì1937)= Spain in the early 1930s was a time of political and social turbulence. Due to both a surge in anti-clerical sentiment and a longrunning desire for retribution for the corruption and malfesance of the extreme right and their supporters in the church, Anarchists and Radical Socialists sacked monarchist headquarters in Madrid and proceeded to burn down or otherwise wreck more than a dozen churches in the capital. Similar revolutionary acts occurred in many other cities in southern and eastern Spain, in most cases with the acquiescence and occasionally with the assistance of the official Republican authorities. Bu√±uel's future wife, Jeanne Rucar, recalled that during that period, \\"he got very excited about politics and the ideas that were everywhere in pre-Civil War Spain\\". In the first flush of his enthusiasm, Bu√±uel joined the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) in 1931, though later in life he denied becoming a Communist. Group of Hurdanos early in the 20th century In 1932, Bu√±uel was invited to serve as film documentarian for the celebrated Mission Dakar-Djibouti, the first large-scale French anthropological field expedition, which, led by Marcel Griaule, unearthed some 3,500 African artifacts for the new Mus√©e de l'Homme. Although he declined, the project piqued his interest in ethnography. After reading the academic study, Las Jurdes: √©tude de g√©ographie humaine (1927) by Maurice Legendre, he decided to make a film focused on peasant life in Extremadura, one of Spain's poorest states. The film, called Las Hurdes: Tierra Sin Pan (1933), was financed on a budget of 20,000 pesetas donated by a working-class anarchist friend named Ram√≥n Ac√≠n, who had won the money in a lottery. In the film, Bu√±uel matches scenes of deplorable social conditions with narration that resembles travelogue commentary delivered by a detached-sounding announcer, while the soundtrack thunders inappropriate music by Brahms. Las Hurdes was banned by the Second Spanish Republic and then by the Francoist dictatorship. It is a film which continues to perplex viewers and resists easy categorization by film historians. Las Hurdes has been called one of the first examples of mockumentary, and has been labeled a \\"surrealist documentary\\", a term defined by critic Merc√® Ibarz as \\"A multi-layered and unnerving use of sound, the juxtaposition of narrative forms already learnt from the written press, travelogues and new pedagogic methods, as well as a subversive use of photographed and filmed documents understood as a basis for contemporary propaganda for the masses\\". Catherine Russell has stated that in Las Hurdes, Bu√±uel was able to reconcile his political philosophy with his surrealist aesthetic, with surrealism becoming \\"a means of awakening a marxist materialism in danger of becoming a stale orthodoxy\\". After Las Hurdes in 1933, Bu√±uel worked in Paris in the dubbing department of Paramount Pictures, but following his marriage in 1934, he switched to Warner Brothers because they operated dubbing studios in Madrid. A friend, Ricardo Urgoiti, who owned the commercial film company Film√≥fono, invited Bu√±uel to produce films for a mass audience. He accepted the offer, viewing it as an \\"experiment\\" as he knew the film industry in Spain was still far behind the technical level of Hollywood or Paris. According to film historian Manuel Rotellar's interviews with members of the cast and crew of the Film√≥fono studios, Bu√±uel's only condition was that his involvement with these pictures be completely anonymous, apparently for fear of damaging his reputation as a surrealist. Rotellar insists, however, \\"the truth is that it was Luis Bu√±uel who directed the Film√≥fono productions\\". Jos√© Luis S√°enz de Heredia, the titular director of two of the films created during Bu√±uel's years as \\"executive producer\\" at Film√≥fono, recounted that it was Bu√±uel who \\"explained to me every morning what he wanted...We looked at the takes together and it was Bu√±uel who chose the shots, and in editing, I wasn't even allowed to be present.\\" Of the 18 films produced by Bu√±uel during his years at Film√≥fono, the four that are believed by critical consensus to have been directed by him are: > * Don Quint√≠n el amargao (Don Quintin the Sourpuss), 1935 ‚Äì a musical based > on a play by Carlos Arniches, the first zarzuela (a type of Spanish opera) > filmed in sound. * La hija de Juan Sim√≥n (Juan Sim√≥n's Daughter), 1935 ‚Äì > another musical and a major commercial success * ¬øQui√©n me quiere a m√≠? (Who > Loves Me?), 1936 ‚Äì a sentimental comedy that Bu√±uel called \\"my only > commercial failure, and a pretty dismal one at that\\". * ¬°Centinela, alerta!, > (Sentry, Keep Watch!), 1937 ‚Äì a comedy and Film√≥fono's biggest box-office > hit. During the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì1939), Bu√±uel placed himself at the disposal of the Republican government. The minister for foreign affairs sent him first to Geneva (September, 1936) and then to Paris for two years (1936‚Äì38), with official responsibility for cataloging Republican propaganda films. Besides the cataloguing, Bu√±uel took left-wing tracts to Spain, did some occasional spying, acted as a bodyguard, and supervised the making of a documentary, entitled Espa√±a 1936 in France and Espana leal, ¬°en armas! in Spain, that covered the elections, the parades, the riots, and the war. In August 1936, Federico Garc√≠a Lorca was shot and killed by Nationalist militia. According to his son, Juan Luis, Bu√±uel rarely talked about Lorca but mourned the poet's untimely death throughout his life. Bu√±uel essentially functioned as the coordinator of film propaganda for the Republic, which meant that he was in a position to examine all film shot in the country and decide what sequences could be developed and distributed abroad. The Spanish Ambassador suggested that Bu√±uel revisit Hollywood where he could give technical advice on films being made there about the Spanish Civil War, so in 1938, he and his family traveled to the United States using funds obtained from his old patrons, the Noailles. Almost immediately upon his arrival in America, however, the war ended and the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors Association of America discontinued making films on the Spanish conflict. According to Bu√±uel's wife, returning to Spain was impossible since the Fascists had seized power, so Bu√±uel decided to stay in the U.S. indefinitely, stating that he was \\"immensely attracted by the American naturalness and sociability\\". =United States (1938‚Äì1945)= 295pxthumbMuseum of Modern Art, 1943. Bu√±uel was employed at MOMA during WWII, supervising and editing documentaries for Latin American countries, commissioned by the Committee on Inter-American Affairs headed by Nelson Rockefeller Returning to Hollywood in 1938, he was befriended by Frank Davis, an MGM producer and member of the Communist Party USA, who placed Bu√±uel on the payroll of Cargo of Innocence, a film about Spanish refugee mothers and children fleeing from Bilbao to the USSR. The project was shelved precipitately when another Hollywood film about the Spanish Civil War, Blockade, was met with disfavor by the Catholic League of Decency. In the words of biographer Ruth Brandon, Bu√±uel and his family \\"lived from one unsatisfactory crumb of work to another\\" because he \\"had none of the arrogance and pushiness essential for survival in Hollywood\\". He just wasn't flamboyant enough to capture the attention of Hollywood decision makers, in the opinion of film composer George Antheil: \\"Inasmuch as [Bu√±uel], his wife and his little boy seemed to be such absolutely normal, solid persons, as totally un-Surrealist in the Dal√≠ tradition as one could possibly imagine.\\" For the most part, he was snubbed by many of the people in the film community whom he met during his first trip to America, although he was able to sell some gags to Chaplin for his film The Great Dictator. In desperation, to market himself to independent producers, he composed a 21-page autobiography, a section of which, headed \\"My Present Plans\\", outlined proposals for two documentary films: * \\"The Primitive Man\\", which would depict \\"the terrible struggle of primitive man against a hostile universe, how the world appeared, how they saw it, what ideas they had on love, on death, on fraternity, how and why religion is born\\", [italics in original] * \\"Psycho- Pathology\\", which would \\"expose the origin and development of different psychopathic diseases... Such a documental film, apart from its great scientific interest, could depict on screen a New Form of Terror or its synonym Humour.\\" [italics in original] Nobody showed any interest and Bu√±uel realized that staying in Los Angeles was futile, so he traveled to New York City to see if he could change his fortunes. In New York City, Antheil introduced Bu√±uel to Iris Barry, chief curator of film at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). Barry talked Bu√±uel into joining a committee formed to help educate those within the U.S. government who might not have appreciated fully the effectiveness of film as a medium of propaganda. Bu√±uel was hired to produce a shortened version of Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will (1935) as a demonstration project. The finished product was a compilation of scenes from Riefenstahl's Nazi epic with Hans Bertram's Feuertaufe. Bu√±uel stayed at MoMA to work for the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs (OCIAA) as part of a production team that would gather, review and edit films intended as anti-fascist propaganda to be distributed in Latin America by American embassies. While being vetted for the job at the OCIAA, upon being asked if he was a Communist, he replied: \\"I am a Republican,\\" and, apparently, the interviewer did not realize that Bu√±uel was referring to the Spanish socialist coalition government, not the American political party. Describing Bu√±uel's work at MoMA, his friend, composer Gustavo Pittaluga, stated: \\"Luis created maybe 2,000 remarkable works. We were sent anodyne documentaries, often extremely feeble primary materials, which the Museum team turned into marvellous films. And not just Spanish versions, but also Portuguese, French and English... He would create a good documentary through editing.\\" [italics in original] In 1942, Bu√±uel applied for American citizenship, because he anticipated that MoMA would soon be put under federal control. But that same year, Dal√≠ published his autobiography, The Secret Life of Salvador Dal√≠, in which he made it clear that he had split with Bu√±uel because the latter was a Communist and an atheist. News of this reached Archbishop Spellman, who angrily confronted Barry with the question: \\"Are you aware that you are harbouring in this Museum the Antichrist, the man who made a blasphemous film L'Age d'Or?\\" At the same time, a campaign on the part of Hollywood, through its industry trade paper, the Motion Picture Herald, to undermine the MoMA film unit resulted in a 66% reduction in the department's budget and Bu√±uel felt himself compelled to resign. In 1944, he returned to Hollywood for the third time, this time as Spanish Dubbing Producer for Warner Brothers. Before leaving New York City, he confronted Dal√≠ at his hotel, the Sherry Netherland, to tell the painter about the damage his book had done and then shoot him in the knee. Bu√±uel did not carry out the violent part of his plan. Dal√≠ explained himself by saying: \\"I did not write my book to put YOU on a pedestal. I wrote it to put ME on a pedestal\\". Man Ray ‚Äì a friend from Bu√±uel's surrealist period and collaborator on unrealized Hollywood projects. Bu√±uel's first dubbing assignment on returning to Hollywood was My Reputation, a Barbara Stanwyck picture which became El Que Diran in Bu√±uel's hands. In addition to his dubbing work, Bu√±uel attempted to develop a number of independent projects: * In collaboration with an old friend from his Surrealist days, Man Ray, he worked on a scenario called The Sewers of Los Angeles, which took place on a mountain of excrement close to a highway and a dust basin. * With his friend, Jos√© Rubia Barcia, he co-wrote a screenplay called La novia de medianoche (The Midnight Bride), a gothic thriller, which lay dormant until it was filmed by Antonio Sim√≥n in 1997. * He continued working on a screenplay called \\"Goya and the Duchess of Alba\\", a treatment he had started as early as 1927, with the actor/producer Flori√°n Rey and cameraman Jos√© Mar√≠a Beltr√°n, and then resuscitated in 1937 as a project for Paramount. * In his 1982 autobiography Mon Dernier soupir (My Last Sigh, 1983, My Last Breath, 1994), Bu√±uel wrote that at the request of director Robert Florey, he submitted a treatment of a scene about a disembodied hand, which was later included in the movie The Beast with Five Fingers (1946), starring Peter Lorre, without acknowledgement of Bu√±uel's contribution or payment of any compensation. However, Brian Taves, film scholar and archivist with the Library of Congress, has challenged the truth of this claim. In 1945, Bu√±uel's contract with Warner Brothers expired, and he decided not to renew it in order, as he put it: \\"to realize my life's ambition for a year: to do nothing\\". While his family enjoyed themselves at the beach, Bu√±uel spent much of his time in Antelope Valley with new acquaintances writer Aldous Huxley and sculptor Alexander Calder, from whom he rented a house. In his autobiography, in a chapter about his second spell in America, Bu√±uel states that \\"[o]n several occasions, both American and European producers have suggested that I tackle a film version of Malcolm Lowry's Under the Volcano\\", but that after reading the book many times as well as eight different screenplays he was unable to come up with a solution for the cinema. The movie was eventually made in 1984 by John Huston. =Intermediate years (1946‚Äì1961)=Mexico (1946‚Äì1953) In 1946, an old friend, producer Denise Tual, the widow of Pierre Batcheff, the leading man in Un Chien Andalou, proposed that she and Bu√±uel adapt Lorca's play La casa de Bernarda Alba for production in Paris. As it turned out, though, before they could both make their way to Europe, they encountered problems in securing the rights from Lorca's family. While in Mexico City, on a stopover, they had asked √ìscar Dancigers, a Russian √©migr√© producer active in Mexico, for financing. Dancigers ran an independent production company that specialized in assisting U.S. film studios with on- location shooting in Mexico, but following World War II, he had lost his connection with Hollywood due to his being blacklisted as a Communist. Although Dancigers wasn't enthusiastic about the Lorca project, he did want to work with Bu√±uel and persuaded the Spanish director to undertake a totally different project. Libertad Lamarque, star of Bu√±uel's first Mexican film. Bu√±uel was said to have held a long-time grudge against Lamarque because the actress was able to bring him to tears when he viewed a \\"corny melodrama\\" which she had made in Argentina: \\"How could I let myself cry over such an absurd, grotesque, ridiculous scene?\\" The Golden Age of Mexican cinema was peaking in the mid-to-late 1940s, at just the time Bu√±uel was connecting with Dancigers. Movies represented Mexico's third largest industry by 1947, employing 32,000 workers, with 72 film producers who invested 66 million pesos (approximately U.S. $13 million) per year, four active studios with 40 million pesos of invested capital, and approximately 1,500 theaters throughout the nation, with about 200 in Mexico City alone. For their first project, the two men selected what seemed like a sure-fire success, Gran Casino, a musical period piece set in Tampico during the boom years of oil exploitation, starring two of the most popular entertainers in Latin America: Libertad Lamarque, an Argentine actress and singer, and Jorge Negrete, a Mexican singer and leading man in \\"charro\\" films, a Mexican equivalent to the American western. Bu√±uel recalled: \\"I kept them singing all the time‚Äîa competition, a championship\\". The film was not successful at the box office, with some even calling it a fiasco. Different reasons have been given for its failure with the public; for some, Bu√±uel was forced to make concessions to the bad taste of his stars, particularly Negrete, others cite Bu√±uel's rusty technical skills and lack of confidence after so many years out of the director's chair, while still others speculate that Mexican audiences were tiring of genre movies, called \\"churros\\", that were perceived as being cheaply and hastily made. The failure of Gran Casino sidelined Bu√±uel, and it was over two years before he had the chance to direct another picture. According to Bu√±uel, he spent this time \\"scratching my nose, watching flies and living off my mother's money\\", but he was actually somewhat more industrious than that may sound. With the husband/wife team of Janet and Luis Alcoriza, he wrote the scenario for Si usted no puede, yo s√≠, which was filmed in 1950 by Juli√°n Soler. He also continued developing the idea for a surrealistic film called Ilegible, hijo de flauta, with the poet Juan Larrea. Dancigers pointed out to him that there was currently public interest in films about street urchins, so Bu√±uel scoured the back streets and slums of Mexico City in search of material, interviewing social workers about street gang warfare and murdered children. During this period, Dancigers was busy producing films for the actor/director Fernando Soler, one of the most durable of Mexican film personalities, having been referred to as the \\"national paterfamilias\\". Although Soler typically preferred to direct his own films, for their next collaboration, El Gran Calavera, based on a play by Adolfo Torrado, he decided that doing both jobs would be too much trouble, so he asked Dancigers to find someone who could be trusted to handle the technical aspects of the directorial duties. Bu√±uel welcomed the opportunity, stating that: \\"I amused myself with the montage, the constructions, the angles... All of that interested me because I was still an apprentice in so-called 'normal' cinema.\\" As a result of his work on this film, he developed a technique for making films cheaply and quickly by limiting them to 125 shots. El Gran Calavera was completed in 16 days at a cost of 400,000 pesos (approximately $46,000 US at 1948 exchange rates). The picture has been described as \\"a hilarious screwball send-up of the Mexican nouveau riche... a wild roller coaster of mistaken identity, sham marriages and misfired suicides\\", and it was a big hit at the box office in Mexico. In 2013, the picture was re-made by Mexican director Gary Alazraki under the title The Noble Family. In 1949, Bu√±uel renounced his Spanish citizenship to become a naturalized Mexican. The commercial success of El Gran Calavera enabled Bu√±uel to redeem a promise he had extracted from Dancigers, which was that if Bu√±uel could deliver a money-maker, Dancigers would guarantee \\"a degree of freedom\\" on the next film project. Knowing that Dancigers was uncomfortable with experimentalism, especially when it might affect the bottom line, Bu√±uel proposed a commercial project titled ¬°Mi huerfanito jefe!, about a juvenile street vendor who can't sell his final lottery ticket, which ends up being the winner and making him rich. Dancigers was open to the idea, but instead of a \\"feuilleton\\", he suggested making \\"something rather more serious\\". During his recent researches through the slums of Mexico City, Bu√±uel had read a newspaper account of a twelve-year-old boy's body being found on a garbage dump, and this became the inspiration, and final scene, for the film, eventually called Los olvidados. The film tells the story of a street gang of children who terrorize their impoverished neighborhood, at one point brutalizing a blind man and at another assaulting a legless man who moves around on a dolly, which they toss down a hill. Film historian Carl J. Mora has said of Los olvidados that the director \\"visualized poverty in a radically different way from the traditional forms of Mexican melodrama. Bu√±uel's street children are not 'ennobled' by their desperate struggle for survival; they are in fact ruthless predators who are not better than their equally unromanticized victims\\". The film was made quickly (18 days) and cheaply (450,000 pesos), with Bu√±uel's fee being the equivalent of $2,000. During filming, a number of members of the crew resisted the production in a variety of ways: one technician confronted Bu√±uel and asked why he didn't make a \\"real\\" Mexican movie \\"rather than a miserable picture like this one\\"; the film's hairdresser quit on the spot over a scene in which the protagonist's mother refuses to give him food (\\"In Mexico, no mother would say that to her son.\\"); another staff member urged Bu√±uel to abandon shooting on a \\"garbage heap\\", noting that there were many \\"lovely residential neighborhoods like Las Lomas\\" that were available; while Pedro de Urdimalas, one of the scriptwriters, refused to allow his name in the credits. Octavio Paz, ardent champion of Los olvidados and close friend during Bu√±uel's exile in Mexico This hostility was also felt by those who attended the movie's premi√®re in Mexico City on 9 November 1950, when Los olvidados was taken by many as an insult to Mexican sensibilities and to the Mexican nation. At one point, the audience shrieked in shock as one of the characters looked straight into the camera and hurled a rotten egg at it, leaving a gelatinous, opaque ooze on the lens for a few moments. In his memoir, Bu√±uel recalled that after the initial screening, Diego Rivera's wife the painter Frida Kahlo refused to speak to him, while poet Le√≥n Felipe's wife had to be restrained physically from attacking him. There were even calls to have Bu√±uel's Mexican citizenship revoked. Dancigers, panicked by what he feared would be a complete debacle, quickly commissioned an alternate \\"happy\\" ending to the film, and also tacked on a preface showing stock footage of the skylines of New York City, London and Paris with voice-over commentary to the effect that behind the wealth of all the great cities of the world can be found poverty and malnourished children, and that Mexico City \\"that large modern city, is no exception\\". Regardless, attendance was so poor that Dancigers withdrew the film after only three days in theaters. Through the determined efforts of future Nobel Prize winner for Literature Octavio Paz, who at the time was in Mexico's diplomatic service, Los olvidados was chosen to represent Mexico at the Cannes Film Festival of 1951, and Paz promoted the film assiduously by distributing a supportive manifesto and parading outside the cinema with a placard. Opinion in general was enthusiastic, with the Surrealists (Breton and poet Jacques Prevert) and other artistic intellectuals (painter Marc Chagall and poet/dramatist/filmmaker Jean Cocteau) laudatory, but the communists objected to what they saw as the film's \\"bourgeois morality\\" for containing a scene in which the police stop a pederast from assaulting a child. Bu√±uel won the Best Director prize that year at Cannes, and also won the FIPRESCI International Critics' Award. After receiving these accolades, the film was reissued in Mexico where it ran for two months to much greater acceptance and profit. Los olvidados and its triumph at Cannes made Bu√±uel an instant world celebrity and the most important Spanish-speaking film director in the world. In 2003, Los olvidados was recommended by UNESCO for inclusion in the Memory of the World Register, calling it: \\"the most important document in Spanish about the marginal lives of children in contemporary large cities\\". Bu√±uel remained in Mexico for the rest of his life, although he spent periods of time filming in France and Spain. In Mexico, he filmed 21 films during an 18-year period. For many critics, although there were occasional widely acknowledged masterpieces like Los olvidados and √âl (1953), the majority of his output consisted of generic fare which was adapted to the norms of the national film industry, frequently adopting melodramatic conventions that appealed to local tastes. Other commentators, however, have written of the deceptive complexity and intensity of many of these films, arguing that, collectively, they, \\"bring a philosophical depth and power to his cinema, together offering a sustained meditation on ideas of religion, class inequity, violence and desire\\". Although Bu√±uel usually had little choice regarding the selection of these projects, they often deal with themes that were central to his lifelong concerns: * sexual pathology: √âl (1953), Ensayo de un crimen (1955), and Abismos de pasi√≥n (1954) *the destructive effects of rampant machismo: El Bruto, (1953), El r√≠o y la muerte, (1955); *the blurring of fantasy and reality: Subida al cielo (1952), La ilusi√≥n viaja en tranv√≠a (1954); *the disruptive status of women in a male-dominated culture: Susana (1951), La hija del enga√±o (1951‚Äîa remake of the Film√≥fono production Don Quint√≠n el amargao of 16 years earlier), Una mujer sin amor (1952); and *the absurdity of the religious life: Nazar√≠n (1959) and Sim√≥n del desierto (1965). As busy as he was during the 1950s and early 1960s, there were still many film projects that Bu√±uel had to abandon due to lack of financing or studio support, including a cherished plan to film Mexican novelist Juan Rulfo's Pedro P√°ramo, of which he said how much he enjoyed \\"the crossing from the mysterious to the real, almost without transition. I really like this mixture of reality and fantasy, but I don't know how to bring it to the screen.\\" Other unrealized projects during his lifetime included adaptations of Andr√© Gide's Les caves du Vatican; Benito P√©rez Gald√≥s's Fortunata y Jacinta, Do√±a Perfecta, and √Ångel Guerra; Evelyn Waugh's The Loved One; William Golding's Lord of the Flies; Dalton Trumbo's Johnny Got His Gun; J. K. Huysmans' L√†-Bas; Matthew Lewis's The Monk; Jos√© Donoso's Lugar sin l√≠mites; a film of four stories based on Carlos Fuentes's Aura; and Julio Cort√°zar's Las m√©nades. Mexico and beyond: return to international filmmaking (1954‚Äì1960) Michel Piccoli. The popular French film star appeared in six Bu√±uel films, beginning with La Mort en ce jardin, 1956. As much as he welcomed steady employment in the Mexican film industry, Bu√±uel was quick to seize opportunities to re-emerge onto the international film scene and to engage with themes that were not necessarily focused on Mexican preoccupations. His first chance came in 1954, when Dancigers partnered with Henry F. Ehrlich, of United Artists, to co-produce a film version of Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, using a script developed by the Canadian writer Hugo Butler. The film was produced by George Pepper, the former executive secretary of the Hollywood Democratic Committee. Both Butler and Pepper were emigres from Hollywood who had run afoul of authorities seeking out communists. The result, Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, was Bu√±uel's first color film. Bu√±uel was given much more time than usual for the filming (three months), which was accomplished on location in Manzanillo, a Pacific seaport with a lush jungle interior, and was shot simultaneously in English and Spanish. When the film was released in the United States, its young star Dan O'Herlihy used his own money to fund a Los Angeles run for the film and gave free admission to all members of the Screen Actors Guild, who in turn rewarded the little-known actor with his only Oscar nomination. In the mid-1950s, Bu√±uel got the chance to work again in France on international co- productions. The result was what critic Raymond Durgnat has called the director's \\"revolutionary triptych\\", in that each of the three films is \\"openly, or by implication, a study in the morality and tactics of armed revolution against a right-wing dictatorship\\". The first, Cela s'appelle l'aurore (Franco-Italian, 1956) required Bu√±uel and the \\"pataphysical\\" writer Jean Ferry to adapt a novel by Emmanuel Robl√®s after the celebrated writer Jean Genet failed to deliver a script after having been paid in full. The second film was La Mort en ce jardin (Franco-Mexican, 1956), which was adapted by Bu√±uel and his frequent collaborator Luis Alcoriza from a novel by the Belgian writer Jos√©-Andr√© Lacour. The final part of the \\"triptych\\" was La Fi√®vre Monte √† El Pao (Franco-Mexican, 1959), the last film of the popular French star G√©rard Philipe, who died in the final stages of the production. At one point during the filming, Bu√±uel asked Philipe, who was visibly dying of cancer, why the actor was making this film, and Philipe responded by asking the director the same question, to which both said they didn't know. Bu√±uel was later to explain that he was so strapped for cash that he, \\"took everything that was offered to me, as long as it wasn't humiliating\\". In 1960, Bu√±uel re-teamed with scenarist Hugo Butler and organizer George Pepper, allegedly his favorite producer, to make his second English-language film, a US/Mexico co-production called The Young One, based on a short story by writer and former CIA-agent Peter Matthiessen. This film has been called \\"a surprisingly uncompromising study of racism and sexual desire, set on a remote island in the Deep South\\" and has been described by critic Ed Gonzalez as \\"salacious enough to make Elia Kazan's Baby Doll and Luis Malle's Pretty Baby blush\\". Although the film won a special award at the Cannes Film Festival for its treatment of racial discrimination, the US critics were so hostile upon its release that Bu√±uel was later to say that \\"a Harlem newspaper even wrote that I should be hung upside down from a lamppost on Fifth Avenue....I made this film with love, but it never had a chance.\\" =Late international period (1961‚Äì1977)= At the 1960 Cannes Festival, Bu√±uel was approached by the young director Carlos Saura, whose film Los Golfos had been entered officially to represent Spain. Two years earlier, Saura had partnered with Juan Antonio Bardem and Luis Garc√≠a Berlanga to form a production company called UNINCI, and the group was keen to get Bu√±uel to make a new film in his native country as part of their overall goal of creating a uniquely Spanish brand of cinema. At the same time, Mexican actress Silvia Pinal was eager to work with Bu√±uel and talked her producer-husband Gustavo Alatriste into providing additional funding for the project with the understanding that the director, who Pinal described as \\"a man worshiped and idolized\\", would be given \\"absolute freedom\\" in carrying out the work. Finally, Bu√±uel agreed to work again in Spain when further support was provided by producer Pere Portabella's company Film 59. Bu√±uel and his co-scenarist Julio Alejandro drafted a preliminary screenplay for Viridiana, which critic Andrew Sarris has described as incorporating \\"a plot which is almost too lurid to synopsize even in these enlightened times\\", dealing with rape, incest, hints of necrophilia, animal cruelty and sacrilege, and submitted it to the Spanish censor, who, to the surprise of nearly everyone, approved it after requesting only minor modifications and one significant change to the ending. Although Bu√±uel accommodated the censor's demands, he came up with a final scene that was even more provocative than the scene it replaced: \\"even more immoral\\", as Bu√±uel was later to observe. Since Bu√±uel had more than adequate resources, top-flight technical and artistic crews, and experienced actors, filming of Viridiana (which took place on location and at Bardem's studios in Madrid) went smoothly and quickly. Bu√±uel submitted a cutting copy to the censors and then arranged for his son, Juan Luis, to smuggle the negatives to Paris for the final editing and mixing, ensuring that the authorities would not have an opportunity to view the finished product before its planned submission as Spain's official entry to the 1961 Cannes Festival. Spain's director general of cinematography Jos√© Mu√±oz-Font√°n presented the film on the last day of the festival and then, on the urging of Portabella and Bardem, appeared in person to accept the top prize, the Palme d'Or, which the film shared with the French entry Une aussi longue absence, directed by Henri Colpi. Within days, l'Osservatore Romano, the Vatican's official organ, denounced the film as an insult not only to Catholicism but to Christianity in general. Consequences to nearly all concerned were swift: Mu√±oz-Font√°n was dismissed from his government post, the film was banned in Spain for the next 17 years, all mention of it in the press was prohibited, and the two Spanish production companies UNINCI and Film 59 were disbanded. \\"When today I amuse myself by making useless calculations, I realize that Bu√±uel and I shared more than two thousand meals together and that on more than fifteen hundred occasions he knocked on my door, notes in hand, ready to begin work. I'm not even counting the walks, the drinks, the films we watched together, the film festivals.\\" ‚Äì Jean-Claude Carri√®re on his long-term collaboration with Bu√±uel. Bu√±uel went on to make two more films in Mexico with Pinal and Alatriste, El √°ngel exterminador (1962) and Sim√≥n del desierto (1965)‚Äî along with Viridiana, they form the so-called \\"Bu√±uelian trilogy\\" ‚Äî and was later to say that Alatriste had been the one producer who gave him the most freedom in creative expression. In 1963, actor Fernando Rey, one of the stars of Viridiana, introduced Bu√±uel to producer Serge Silberman, a Polish entrepreneur who had fled to Paris when his family died in the Holocaust and had worked with several renowned French directors, including Jean-Pierre Melville, Jacques Becker, Marcel Camus and Christian-Jaque. Silberman proposed that the two make an adaptation of Octave Mirbeau's Journal d'une femme de chambre, which Bu√±uel had read several times. Bu√±uel wanted to do the filming in Mexico with Pinal, but Silberman insisted it be done in France. Pinal was so determined to work again with Bu√±uel that she was ready to move to France, learn the language and even work for nothing in order to get the part of C√©lestine, the title character. Silberman, however, wanted French actress Jeanne Moreau to play the role, so he put Pinal off by telling her that Moreau, too, was willing to act with no fee. Ultimately, Silberman got his way, leaving Pinal so disappointed that she was later to claim that Alatriste's failure to help her secure this part led to the breakup of their marriage. When Bu√±uel requested a French-speaking writer with whom to collaborate on the screenplay, Silberman suggested the 32-year-old Jean-Claude Carri√®re, an actor whose previous screenwriting credits included only a few films for the comic star/director Pierre √âtaix, but once Bu√±uel learned that Carri√®re was the heir to a wine-growing family, the newcomer was hired on the spot. At first, Carri√®re found it difficult to work with Bu√±uel, because the young man was so deferential to the famous director that he never challenged any of Bu√±uel's ideas, until, at Bu√±uel's covert insistence, Silberman told Carri√®re to stand up to Bu√±uel now and then; as Carri√®re was later to say: \\"In a way, Bu√±uel needed an opponent. He didn't need a secretary ‚Äì he needed someone to contradict him and oppose him and to make suggestions.\\" The finished 1964 film, Diary of a Chambermaid, became the first of several to be made by the team of Bu√±uel, Carri√®re and Silberman. Carri√®re was later to say: \\"Without me and without Serge Silberman, the producer, perhaps Bu√±uel would not have made so many films after he was 65. We really encouraged him to work. That's for sure.\\" This was the second filmed version of Mirbeau's novel, the first being a 1946 Hollywood production directed by Jean Renoir, which Bu√±uel refused to view for fear of being influenced by the famous French director, whom he venerated. Bu√±uel's version, while admired by many, has often been compared unfavorably to Renoir's, with a number of critics claiming that Renoir's Diary fits better in Renoir's overall oeuvre, while Bu√±uel's Diary is not sufficiently \\"Bu√±uelian\\". After the 1964 release of Diary, Bu√±uel again tried to make a film of Matthew Lewis' The Monk, a project on which he had worked, on and off, since 1938, according to producer Pierre Braunberger. He and Carri√®re wrote a screenplay, but were unable to obtain funding for the project, which would be finally realized in 1973 under the direction of Bu√±uel devotee Ado Kyrou, with considerable assistance from both Bu√±uel and Carri√®re. In 1965, Bu√±uel managed to work again with Silvia Pinal in what would turn out to be his last Mexican feature, co-starring Claudio Brook, Sim√≥n del desierto. Pinal was keenly interested in continuing to work with Bu√±uel, trusting him completely and frequently stating that he brought out the best in her; however, this would be their last collaboration. Belle de Jour (1967), and Tristana (1970) said: \\"Well, I think it was difficult for him, coping with his deafness. Some people said he was not that deaf, but I think, when you don't hear very well and when you're tired, everything sinks into a buzz, and it is very hard. French is not his language, so on Belle de Jour, I'm sure that it was much more of an effort for him to have to explain.\\". In 1966, Bu√±uel was contacted by the Hakim brothers, Robert and Raymond, Egyptian-French producers who specialized in sexy films directed by star filmmakers, who offered him the opportunity to direct a film version of Joseph Kessel's novel Belle de Jour, a book about an affluent young woman who leads a double life as a prostitute, and that had caused a scandal upon its first publication in 1928. Bu√±uel did not like Kessel's novel, considering it \\"a bit of a soap opera\\", but he took on the challenge because: \\"I found it interesting to try to turn something I didn't like into something I did.\\" So he and Carri√®re set out enthusiastically to interview women in the brothels of Madrid to learn about their sexual fantasies. Bu√±uel also was not happy about the choice of the 22-year-old Catherine Deneuve for the title role, feeling that she had been foisted upon him by the Hakim brothers and Deneuve's lover at the time, director Fran√ßois Truffaut. As a result, both actress and director found working together difficult, with Deneuve claiming, \\"I felt they showed more of me than they'd said they were going to. There were moments when I felt totally used. I was very unhappy,\\" and Bu√±uel deriding her prudery on the set. The resulting film has been described by film critic Roger Ebert as \\"possibly the best-known erotic film of modern times, perhaps the best\\", even though, as another critic has written, \\"in terms of explicit sexual activity, there is little in Belle de jour we might not see in a Doris Day comedy from the same year\\". It was Bu√±uel's most successful film at the box office. Critics have noted Bu√±uel's habit of following up a commercial or critical success with a more personal, idiosyncratic film that might have less chance of popular esteem. After the worldwide success of his 1967 Belle de jour, and upon viewing Jean-Luc Godard's film La Chinoise, Bu√±uel, who had wanted to make a film about Catholic heresies for years, told Carri√®re: \\"If that is what today's cinema is like, then we can make a film about heresies.\\" The two spent months researching Catholic history and created the 1969 film The Milky Way, a \\"picaresque road film\\" that tells the story of two vagabonds on pilgrimage to the tomb of the Apostle James at Santiago de Compostela, during which they travel through time and space to take part in situations illustrating heresies that arose from the six major Catholic dogmas. Vincent Canby, reviewing the film in the New York Times, compared it to George Stevens' blockbuster The Greatest Story Ever Told, in that Bu√±uel had made a film about Jesus casting nearly all the famous French performers of the time in cameo roles. The Milky Way was banned in Italy, only to have the Catholic Church intervene on its behalf. The 1970 film Tristana is a film about a young woman who is seduced and manipulated by her guardian, who attempts to thwart her romance with a young artist and who eventually induces her to marry him after she loses one of her legs due to a tumor. It has been considered by scholar Beth Miller the least understood of Bu√±uel's films, and consequently one of the most underrated, due to a \\"consistent failure to apprehend its political and, especially, its socialist-feminist statement\\". Bu√±uel had wanted to make a film of Benito P√©rez Gald√≥s' novel Tristana as early as 1952, even though he considered Gald√≥s' book the author's weakest. After finishing Viridiana and in the wake of the scandal its release caused in 1962, the Spanish censor flatly turned down this project, and Bu√±uel had to wait for 8 years before he could receive backing from the Spanish production company √âpoca Films. The censors had threatened to deny permission for the film on the grounds that it encouraged duelling, so Bu√±uel had to approach the subject matter very gingerly, in addition to making concessions to his French/Italian/Spanish producers, who insisted on casting two of the three primary roles with actors not of Bu√±uel's choosing: Franco Nero and Catherine Deneuve. On this occasion, however, Deneuve and Bu√±uel had a more mutually satisfactory working relationship, with Deneuve telling an interviewer, \\"but in the end, you know, it was actually rather a wonderful shoot. Tristana is one of my favorite films. Personally, as an actress, I prefer Tristana to Belle de Jour.\\" The germ of the idea for their next film together, The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972) came from Bu√±uel and Silberman discussing uncanny repetition in everyday life; Silberman told an anecdote about how he had invited some friends for dinner at his house, only to forget about it, so that, on the night of the dinner party, he was absent and his wife was in her nightclothes. The film tells of a group of affluent friends who are continually stymied in their attempts to eat a meal together, a situation that a number of critics have contrasted to the opposite dilemma of the characters in The Exterminating Angel, where guests of a dinner party are mysteriously unable to leave after having completed their meal. For this film, Bu√±uel, Silberman and Carri√®re assembled a top-flight cast of European performers, \\"a veritable rogues' gallery of French art-house cinema\\", according to one critic. For the first time, Bu√±uel made use of a video-playback monitor, which allowed him to make much more extensive use of crane shots and elaborate tracking shots, and enabled him to cut the film in the camera and eliminate the need for reshoots. Filming required only two months and Bu√±uel claimed that editing took only one day. When the film was released, Silberman decided to skip the Cannes Festival in order to concentrate on getting it nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, which it won, leading Bu√±uel to express his contempt for a process that relied on the judgment of \\"2500 idiots, including for example the assistant dress designer of the studio\\". As was his habit, Bu√±uel took advantage of the popular success of Discreet Charm to make one of the \\"puzzling, idiosyncratic films he really wanted to make\\". In 1973, at the Monastery of Paular in the Spanish Somosierra, he wrote the screenplay for The Phantom of Liberty (1974) with Carri√®re for production by Silberman and his Hollywood partners. The resulting film is a series of 12 distinctive episodes with separate protagonists, linked together only by following a character from one episode to another in a relay- race manner. Bu√±uel has stated that he made the film as a tribute to poet Benjamin P√©ret, a founding member of French Surrealism, and called it his \\"most Surrealist film\\". Bu√±uel's final film was That Obscure Object of Desire (1977), adapted by Bu√±uel and Carri√®re from an 1898 novel by Pierre Lou√øs called La Femme et le pantin, which had already been used as the basis of films directed by Josef von Sternberg (The Devil is a Woman, 1935) and Julien Duvivier (La Femme et le Pantin, 1959). The film, which tells the story of an older man who is obsessed by a young woman who continually evades his attempts to consummate a sexual relationship, starred the Spanish actor Fernando Rey, appearing in his fourth Bu√±uel film. Initially, the part of the young woman was to be played by Maria Schneider, who had achieved international fame for her roles in Last Tango in Paris and The Passenger, but once shooting started, according to Carri√®re, her drug usage resulted in a \\"lackluster and dull\\" performance that caused tempestuous arguments with Bu√±uel on the set and her eventual dismissal. Silberman, the producer, decided to abandon the project at that point, but was convinced by Bu√±uel to continue shooting with two different actresses, √Ångela Molina and Carole Bouquet playing the same role in alternating sequences throughout the film. In his autobiography, Bu√±uel claimed that this unusual casting decision was his own idea after drinking two dry martinis, saying: \\"If I had to list all the benefits derived from alcohol, it would be endless\\". Others have reported that Carri√®re had first broached the idea while developing the film's scenario, but had been brushed off by Bu√±uel as \\"the whim of a rainy day\\". Last years (1978‚Äì1983) After the release of That Obscure Object of Desire, Bu√±uel retired from filmmaking. In 1982, he wrote (along with Carri√®re) his autobiography, Mon Dernier Soupir (My Last Sigh), which provides an account of his life, friends, and family as well as a representation of his eccentric personality. In it, he recounts dreams, encounters with many well-known writers, actors, and artists such as Pablo Picasso and Charlie Chaplin as well as antics, like dressing up as a nun and walking around town. In his seventies, Bu√±uel once told his friend, novelist Carlos Fuentes: \\"I'm not afraid of death. I'm afraid of dying alone in a hotel room, with my bags open and a shooting script on the night table. I must know whose fingers will close my eyes.\\" According to his wife, Jeanne, Bu√±uel died in Mexico City in 1983 from diabetes complications.Reference Jeanne Rucar, \\"Memorias de una mujer sin piano\\". Cabaret Voltaire, Spain 1990 Fuentes has recounted that Bu√±uel spent his last week in hospital discussing theology with the Jesuit brother Juli√°n Pablo Fern√°ndez, a long time friend. His funeral was very private, involving only family and close friends, among them poets Octavio Paz and Homero Aridjis. Personal life Starting at age 17, Bu√±uel steadily dated the future poet and dramatist Concha M√©ndez, with whom he vacationed every summer at San Sebasti√°n. He introduced her to his friends at the Residencia as his fianc√©e. After five years, she broke off the relationship, citing Bu√±uel's \\"insufferable character\\". During his student years, Bu√±uel became an accomplished hypnotist. He claimed that once, while calming a hysterical prostitute through hypnotic suggestion, he inadvertently put one of the several bystanders into a trance as well. He was often to insist that watching movies was a form of hypnosis: \\"This kind of cinematographic hypnosis is no doubt due to the darkness of the theatre and to the rapidly changing scenes, lights, and camera movements, which weaken the spectator's critical intelligence and exercise over him a kind of fascination.\\" In 1926 he met his future wife, Jeanne Rucar Lefebvre,http://elpais.com/diario/1994/11/07/agenda/784162802_850215.html a gymnastics teacher who had won a bronze medal at the 1924 Paris Olympics. Bu√±uel courted her in a formal Aragonese manner, complete with a chaperone, and they married in 1934 despite a warning by Jean Epstein when Bu√±uel first proposed in 1930: \\"Jeanne, you are making a mistake... It's not right for you, don't marry him.\\" The two remained married throughout his life and had two sons, Juan Luis and Rafael. Diego Bu√±uel, filmmaker and host of the National Geographic Channel's Don't Tell My Mother series, is their grandson. Technique and influences Bu√±uel's technique of filmmaking was strongly influenced by mise-en-sc√®ne, sound editing and use of music. The influences on his filmmaking have included a positive relationship to surrealism and a critical approach to atheism and religion. Bu√±uel's style of directing was extremely economical; he shot films in a few weeks, rarely deviating from his script (the scene in Tristana where Catherine Deneuve exposes her breasts to Saturno ‚Äì but not the audience ‚Äì being a noted exception) and shooting as much as possible in order to minimize editing time. He remained true throughout his working life to an operating philosophy that he articulated at the beginning of his career in 1928: \\"The guiding idea, the silent procession of images that are concrete, decisive, measured in space and time‚Äîin a word, the film‚Äîwas first projected inside the brain of the filmmaker\\". In this, Bu√±uel has been compared with Alfred Hitchcock, another director famous for precision, efficiency and preplanning, for whom actually shooting the film was an anticlimax, since each man would know, in Bu√±uel's words, \\"exactly how each scene will be shot and what the final montage will be\\". According to actress Jeanne Moreau: \\"He was the only director I know who never threw away a shot. He had the film in his mind. When he said 'action' and 'cut,' you knew that what was in between the two would be printed.\\" Tributes (IES) Luis Bu√±uel, Zaragoza, Spain * In 1994, a retrospective of Bu√±uel's works was organized by the Kunst- und Ausstellungshalle in Bonn, as homage to one of the most internationally revered figures in world cinema.

A portion of the television mini-series Lorca, muerte de un poeta (1987‚Äì1988), directed by Juan Antonio Bardem recreates the student years of Bu√±uel, Lorca and Dal√≠, with Fernando Valverde portraying Bu√±uel in two episodes. He was played by Dimiter Guerasimof in the 1991 biopic Dal√≠, directed by Antoni Ribas, despite the fact that Dal√≠ and his attorney had written to Ribas objecting to the project in its early stages in 1985. Bu√±uel appeared as a character in Alejandro Pelayo's 1993 film Miroslava, based on the life of actress Miroslava Stern, who committed suicide after appearing in Ensayo de un crimen (1955). Bu√±uel was played by three actors, El Gran Wyoming (old age), Pere Arquillu√© (young adult) and Juan Carlos Jim√©nez Mar√≠n (child), in Carlos Saura's 2001 fantasy, Bu√±uel y la mesa del rey Salom√≥n, which tells of Bu√±uel, Lorca and Dal√≠ setting out in search of the mythical table of King Salom√≥n, which is thought to have the power to see into the past, the present and the future. Bu√±uel was a character in a 2001 television miniseries Severo Ochoa: La conquista de un Nobel, on the life of the Spanish √©migr√© and Nobel Prize winner in medicine, who was also at the Residencia de Estudiantes during Bu√±uel's time there. Matt Lucas portrayed Bu√±uel in Richard Curson Smith's 2002 TV movie Surrealissimo: The Scandalous Success of Salvador Dal√≠, a comedy depicting Dal√≠'s \\"trial\\" by the Surrealists in 1934 for his pro-Hitler sympathies. A 2005 short called The Death of Salvador Dali, directed by Delaney Bishop, contains sequences in which Bu√±uel appears, played by Alejandro Cardenas. Paul Morrison's Little Ashes hypothesizes a love affair between Dal√≠ and Lorca, with Bu√±uel (played by Matthew McNulty) looking on suspiciously. Bu√±uel, played by Adrien de Van, is one of many notable personalities encountered by Woody Allen's protagonist in Midnight in Paris (2011). Awards Bu√±uel was given the Career Golden Lion in 1982 by the Venice Film Festival and the FIPRESCI Prize ‚Äì Honorable Mention in 1969 by the Berlin International Film Festival. In 1977, he received the National Prize for Arts and Sciences for Fine Arts.

The decision consolidated two similar cases. Seeking to improve sanitary conditions, the Louisiana legislature and the city of New Orleans had established a corporation charged with regulating the slaughterhouse industry. Members of the Butchers' Benevolent Association challenged the constitutionality of the corporation, claiming that it violated the Fourteenth Amendment. That amendment had been ratified in the aftermath of the American Civil War with the primary intention of protecting civil rights of millions of newly emancipated freedmen in the Southern United States, but the butchers argued that the amendment protected their right to \\"sustain their lives through labor.\\" In the majority opinion written by Associate Justice Samuel Freeman Miller, the Court held to a narrower interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment than the plaintiffs urged, ruling that it did not restrict the police powers exercised by Louisiana because the Privileges or Immunities Clause protected only those rights guaranteed by the United States, not individual states. In effect, the clause was interpreted to convey limited protection pertinent to a small minority of rights, such as the right to seek federal office. In a dissenting opinion, Associate Justice Stephen J. Field wrote that Miller's opinion effectively rendered the Fourteenth Amendment a \\"vain and idle enactment.\\" Though the decision in the Slaughter-House Cases minimized the impact of the Privileges or Immunities Clause on state law, the Supreme Court would later strike down state laws on the basis of other clauses in the Fourteenth Amendment, including the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause. Background One writer described New Orleans in the mid- nineteenth century as plagued by \\"intestines and portions of putrefied animal matter lodged [around the drinking pipes]\\" whenever the tide from the Mississippi River was low; the offal came from the city's slaughterhouses. A mile and a half upstream from the city, 1,000 butchers gutted more than 300,000 animals per year. Animal entrails (known as offal), dung, blood, and urine contaminated New Orleans's drinking water, which was implicated in cholera outbreaks among the population. To try to control the problem, a New Orleans grand jury recommended that the slaughterhouses be moved south, but since many of the slaughterhouses were outside city limits, the grand jury's recommendations carried no weight. The city appealed to the state legislature. As a result, in 1869, the Louisiana legislature passed \\"An Act to Protect the Health of the City of New Orleans, to Locate the Stock Landings and Slaughter Houses, and to incorporate the Crescent City Livestock Landing and Slaughter- House Company,\\" which allowed the city of New Orleans to create a corporation that centralized all slaughterhouse operations in the city. At the time, New York City, San Francisco, Boston, Milwaukee, and Philadelphia had similar provisions to confine butchers to areas in order to keep offal from contaminating the water supply. The legislature chartered a private corporation, the Crescent City Live-Stock Landing and Slaughter-House Company, to run a Grand Slaughterhouse at the southern part of the city, opposite the Mississippi River. Crescent City would not slaughter beef itself but act as a franchise corporation, by renting out space to other butchers in the city for a fee, under a designated maximum. The statute also granted \\"sole and exclusive privilege of conducting and carrying on the livestock landing and slaughterhouse business within the limits and privilege granted by the act, and that all such animals shall be landed at the stock landings and slaughtered at the slaughterhouses of the company, and nowhere else. Penalties are enacted for infractions of this provision, and prices fixed for the maximum charges of the company for each steamboat and for each animal landed\\". The exclusivity would last for a period of 25 years. All other slaughterhouses would be closed up, forcing butchers to slaughter within the operation set up by Crescent City. The statute forbade Crescent City from favoring one butcher over another by promising harsh penalties for refusal to sell space to any butcher. All animals on the premises would be inspected by an officer appointed by the governor of the state. Over 400 members of the Butchers' Benevolent Association joined together to sue to stop Crescent City's takeover of the slaughterhouse industry. In the background of his majority opinion, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Freeman Miller reiterated the concerns of the butchers: > This statute is denounced [by the butchers] not only as creating a monopoly > and conferring odious and exclusive privileges upon a small number of > persons at the expense of the great body of the community of New Orleans, > but it is asserted that it deprives a large and meritorious class of > citizens‚Äîthe whole of the butchers of the city‚Äîof the right to exercise > their trade, the business to which they have been trained and on which they > depend for the support of themselves and their families, and that the > unrestricted exercise of the business of butchering is necessary to the > daily subsistence of the population of the city. The lower courts had found in favor of Crescent City in all cases. Six cases were appealed to the Supreme Court. The butchers based their claims on the due process, privileges or immunities, and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, which had been ratified by the states five years earlier. It had been passed with the intention of protecting the civil rights of the millions of newly emancipated freedmen in the South, who had been granted citizenship in the United States. The butchers' attorney, former Supreme Court Justice John Archibald Campbell, who had retired from the federal bench because of his Confederate loyalties, represented persons in a number of cases in New Orleans to obstruct Radical Reconstruction. Although the Fourteenth Amendment was passed mainly to protect the freedmen in the South, the language of Section 1 is not racially limited. Campbell used it to argue for a new, broad reading of the Fourteenth Amendment, in order to allow butchers of any race to \\"sustain their lives through labor.\\" Decision Associate Justice Samuel Freeman Miller (left) wrote the majority opinion, and Associate Justice Stephen Johnson Field (right) wrote the lead dissent In a 5‚Äì4 decision issued on April 14, 1873, by Justice Miller, the Court ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment did not forbid Louisiana's use of its police powers to regulate butchers. The Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment's Privileges or Immunities Clause affected only rights of U.S. citizenship, i.e. rights which \\"owe their existence to the Federal government, its National character, its Constitution, or its laws.\\"United States Supreme Court Reports, Volume 21, p. 409. The word \\"owe\\" is often misspelled as \\"own.\\" The Court supported this holding by pointing to the previous clause in the Fourteenth Amendment which expressly distinguished between federal and state citizenship; the Citizenship Clause says, \\"All persons born and naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State where they reside.\\" The Court elaborated: So, according to the Court, the butchers' Fourteenth Amendment rights had not been violated. As author Jack Beatty has put it, the Court thought the Privileges or Immunities Clause only protected \\"access to ports and navigable waterways, the ability to run for federal office, and to be protected while on the high seas... they did not include what we call 'civil rights.'\\" The Court also mentioned some rights enumerated in the Constitution, as examples of privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States: \\"The right to peaceably assemble and petition for redress of grievances, the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, are rights of the citizen guaranteed by the Federal Constitution.\\" But, the Court was wary of going further because, \\"in the absence of language which expresses such a purpose too clearly to admit of doubt,\\" turning the entire field of civil rights and state police power over to the federal government would be too radical of a change: At the time, the Court viewed due process in a procedural light rather than substantively. The Court also held that the amendment was intended primarily to protect former slaves: \\"It is so clearly a provision for that race and that emergency, that a strong case would be necessary for its application to any other.\\" Justice Stephen J. Field wrote in his dissent (which was the only dissent in the case joined by all the other dissenting justices) that Miller's opinion effectively rendered the Fourteenth Amendment a \\"vain and idle enactment.\\" Field accepted Campbell's reading of the amendment as not confined to protection of freed slaves but embracing the common law presumption in favor of an individual right to pursue a legitimate occupation. Field's reading of the due process clause of the amendment would prevail in future cases in which the court read the amendment broadly to protect personal interests against hostile state laws. Subsequent developments The victory of the Crescent City Company survived for only 11 years. By 1879, the State of Louisiana had adopted a new constitution prohibiting the state's ability to grant slaughterhouse monopolies, devolving regulation of cattle slaughter to parishes and municipalities, and banning the subordinate governmental units from granting monopoly rights over such activities. Having essentially lost its monopoly protection, the Crescent City Co. sued. That case ended in Butchers' Union Co. v. Crescent City Co. (1884), with the Supreme Court holding that Crescent City Co. did not have a contract with the state and so that revocation of the monopoly privilege was not a violation of the Contract Clause. Contemporary analysis Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe wrote that \\"the Slaughter-House Cases incorrectly gutted the Privileges or Immunities Clause.\\" Similarly, Yale Law School professor Akhil Amar wrote, \\"Virtually no serious modern scholar‚Äîleft, right, and center‚Äîthinks that Slaughter-House is a plausible reading of the [Fourteenth] Amendment.\\" On the other hand, Kevin Gutzman, contemporary U.S. constitutional scholar and historian, argues that the Fourteenth Amendment was originally meant to protect only \\"specifically federal rights\\" and describes the later, broader interpretation of the Amendment as \\"the Court's [use of] the Fourteenth Amendment to claim a capacious national judicial authority.\\" Gutzman believes that \\"legal academics despise the Slaughterhouse decision because they do think the federal courts should be 'a perpetual censor upon all legislation in the States.'\\" Kevin Newsom, who later became a federal appeals court judge, wrote in 2000 that the Slaughter-House Cases are consistent with using the Privileges or Immunities Clause to apply the federal Bill of Rights against the states, but not for applying unenumerated rights against the states.Newsom, Kevin. \\"Setting Incorporationism Straight: A Reinterpretation of the Slaughter-House Cases,\\" Yale Law Journal, Vol. 109, p. 643 (2000).

Deere found that cast-iron plows were not working very well in the tough prairie soil of Illinois and remembered the needles he had previously polished by running them through sand as he grew up in his father's tailor shop in Rutland, Vermont. Deere came to the conclusion that a plow made out of highly polished steel and a correctly shaped moldboard (the self-scouring steel plow) would be better able to handle the soil conditions of the prairie, especially its sticky clay.Attoun, Marti. \\"American Innovator, Agricultural Icon ,\\" AmericanProfile.com, April 17, 2005.

Displayed at The Henry Ford Museum There are varying versions of the inspiration for Deere's famous steel plow. In one version, he recalled the way the polished steel pitchfork tines moved through hay and soil and thought that same effect could be obtained for a plow. In 1837, Deere developed and manufactured the first commercially successful cast-steel plow. The wrought- iron framed plow had a polished steel share. This made it ideal for the tough soil of the Midwest and worked better than other plows. By early 1838, Deere completed his first steel plow and sold it to a local farmer, Lewis Crandall, who quickly spread word of his success with Deere's plow. Subsequently, two neighbors soon placed orders with Deere. By 1841, Deere was manufacturing 75‚Äì100 plows per year.

Glander, 337 U.S. 562 (1949), was a United States Supreme Court case in which two out-of-state corporations objected to ad valorem taxes imposed upon accounts receivable derived from goods manufactured in Ohio, though these accounts were not used in conducting business in Ohio. The court ruled that the tax violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. Background Wheeling Steel Corp., incorporated in Delaware was authorized to do business in Ohio, and maintained four of its eight manufacturing plants in Ohio. Wheeling's general offices were/are in Wheeling, West Virginia and had sales offices in twelve other states, including Ohio. All accounts were billed and collected from the corporation's main office in Wheeling, West Virginia. National Distillers Products Corporation was incorporated in Virginia and maintained its principal place of business in New York. National Distillers was admitted to do business in Ohio and maintained both a distillery and a warehouse in Ohio, as well as maintaining distilleries and warehouses in six other states. National Distillers operated its payroll through the local offices and conducted all other fiscal affairs from its office in New York. National Distillers did not maintain a sales office in Ohio; orders from Ohio were forwarded to the office in New York for approval. Both appellants paid all taxes required to do business in Ohio, all taxes on real and personal property in Ohio, and all franchise taxes. Additionally, Wheeling paid ad valorem taxes to West Virginia on all accounts receivable, including on those accounts receivable taxed by Ohio, pursuant to Wheeling Steel Corp. v. Fox, 298 US 193. National Distillers' accounts receivable were taxed by neither Virginia nor New York. The Ohio Tax Commissioner assessed ad valorem taxes on accounts receivable derived from shipments originating from Ohio manufacturing plants belonging to Wheeling Steel Corporation and National Distillers Products Corporation on the grounds that such accounts \\"result from the sale of property from a stock of goods maintained within the state.\\". The Board of Tax Appeals affirmed both assessments. Both appellants appealed the Tax Board's decision. The Supreme Court of Ohio affirmed the tax in both cases,150 Ohio St. 229, 80 N.E.2d 863 which were then brought before the Supreme Court of the United States. Opinion of the Court The court held that the ad valorem tax assessed against the accounts receivable of these corporations violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The court declined to address the issue of whether Ohio violated the Due Process Clause in assessing this tax. The court pointed out that Ohio was not required to admit these foreign corporations to do business within Ohio, and could have limited the terms that these corporations could conduct business within Ohio, so long as any limits did not violate rights derived from the Constitution. Instead, Ohio chose to admit these corporations to conduct business in Ohio, a privilege that these corporations paid taxes to secure and maintain. Because Ohio chose to domesticate these foreign corporations, these corporations became entitled to equal protection with all other domestic corporations established under Ohio law. Ohio's ad valorem tax impermissibly discriminates between domestic and foreign corporations, denying appellants equal protection under Ohio law. Dissent Mr. Justice Douglas is troubled by the notion that corporations are to be classified as people for the purpose of interpreting the Equal Protection Clause. The dissent points out that other clauses in the Constitution that refer to people or persons do not apply to corporations. To read that a reference to persons in the Equal Protection Clause includes corporations as persons is inconsistent and should not be presumed. [Annotation: Mr. Douglas is mistaken in equating 'people' to 'persons', being two distinct entities before the law. The 'people' are the state, the body of sovereigns, from which all lawful instruments derive their standing, and without which become null and void. 'Persons' have long been recognized as creatures of the 14th amendment, subject to the legislature and executive branches and all decisions emanated forthwith. All branches of government are and by the founding principles of America, must remain beneath the sovereigns (people), in all respects.] See also  * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 337 NotesExternal links * Category:1949 in United States case law Category:United States equal protection case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Vinson Court ","title":"Wheeling Steel Corp. v.

Fossils have been found in Mongolia, Germany, and Spain. Etymology The generic name Proailurus comes from the Greek , meaning 'before', and , meaning 'cat'. Description Proailurus lemanensis was a compact and small animal, just a little larger than the domestic cat, weighing about 20 lb (9 kg). It had a long tail, large eyes and sharp claws and teeth, with similar proportions to the modern viverrids. Its claws would have been retractable to some extent. Like the viverrids, Proailurus was at least partially arboreal. Classification The genus Proailurus was first described by Henri Filhol in 1879 for fossils found in the Saint-Gerand site in France. He named two species, Proailurus lemanensis, based on a mandible, and Proailurus julieni. However, P. julieni was later placed in the genus Stenogale. In 1882, Filhol described a third species, Proailurus medius. In 1888, Schlosser made \\"P.\\" medius the type species of the genus Haplogale. Haplogale media's placement was later confirmed by Robert Hunt's 1998 studies of aeluroid skulls. In 1999, Peign√© carried out a systematic review of the genus, naming another two species, P. bourbonnensis and P. major, in the process. Distribution and species Fossils of Proailurus lemanensis were first found in Saint-Gerand and later in Quercy. Robert Hunt, while measuring fragmentary fossils from Hasanda-Gol in Mongolia, placed a lower jaw fragment as Proailurus sp., but Peigne placed the fragment in nimravid genus Eofelis instead, which later authors supported, although at least one suggested the fragment could be assigned to Pseudaelurus cuspidatus instead. Several Proailurus-grade fossils have been found in North America, but remain undescribed. These include the Ginn Quarry cat, known from a complete skull, which has dentition similar to Proailurus lemanensis but with a slightly larger skull. Robert Hunt also noted several specimens that he believed belonged to Proailurus-grade felids, including a pair from the Sheep Creek site in Nebraska, one a lynx-sized felid, the other closer in size to a leopard. He also noted a remarkable individual from an East Cuyumungue locality, possibly the same species as the larger Sheep Creek specimen; and another specimen from Echo Quarry. However, the larger Sheep Creek specimen, the East Cayumungue individual, and the Echo Quarry specimen were all assigned to the species Pseudaelurus validus in 2001, and the smaller Sheep Creek material to Pseudaelurus skinneri in 2003. Evolution Proailurus is believed to have evolved from earlier ailuroid carnivorans such as Stenogale and Haplogale. It is a likely ancestor of Pseudaelurus, which lived 20-10 million years ago, and probably gave rise to the major felid lines, including the extinct machairodontines and the extant felines and pantherines, although the phylogeny of the cats is still not precisely known. Proailurus is largely considered to be the first \\"true\\" cat and the ancestor of the entire cat family. Most studies support this, placing Proailurus as the basal member of the Felidae. One 2005 phylogeny placed it as a basal member of the Feliformia, but later studies do not support this.

It is related to today's felines and pantherines as well as the extinct machairodonts (saber-tooths), and is a successor to Proailurus. It originated from Eurasia and was the first cat to reach North America, when it entered the continent at about 18.5 Ma ending a 'cat-gap' of 7 million years. The slender proportions of the animal, together with its short, viverrid-like legs, suggest that it may have been an agile climber of trees. Species and distribution=Europe= The first and most primitive species Pseudaelurus turnauensis (= Pseudaelurus transitorius) from the early Miocene was about the size of a domestic cat and probably evolved directly from the Oligocene Proailurus. The European Pseudaelurus turnauensis gave rise to additional species. Pseudaelurus lorteti was lynx-sized and the even larger Pseudaelurus quadridentatus weighed about and was approximately the size of a cougar. The latter showed a trend towards slightly enlarged upper canines, indicating that it may have given rise to the later saber-toothed machairodontines. Unexpectedly, the early Pseudaelurus turnauensis survived until 8 million years ago, at which time it is recorded in Germany, whereas the more derived Pseudaelurus lorteti and Pseudaelurus quadridentatus died out 2 million years earlier. A fourth European species is described as Pseudaelurus romieviensis, smaller than P. quadridentatus but larger than P. lorteti. =Asia= P. turnauensis is also recorded in Saudi Arabia from the early Miocene. P. lorteti is also recognized from the middle Miocene of Asia (Jiangsu, China), where two additional species, Pseudaelurus guangheensis from the middle Miocene of Gansu (China) and Pseudaelurus cuspidatus from the middle Miocene of Xinjiang (China) are reported. =North America= A total of five Pseudaelurus-grade species are known from North America. The species P. validus and P. skinneri are both from the late Hemingfordian, while P. intrepidus, P. marshi, and P. stouti (originally described as Lynx stouti) are all from the Early and Late Barstovian. Of those, P. validus, P. intrepidus, and P. marshi are all relatively large species, overlapping in size with each other and with the Eurasian species P. quadridentatus. P. stouti was smaller and more slender in form, and P. skinneri was also a smaller species, overlapping in size with P. lorteti, P. cuspidatus, and P. guagnheensis. Taxonomy and phylogeny Traditionally all the Pseudaelurus-grade species from Europe, Asia, and North America have been assigned to a single genus, even though the paraphyletic nature of the group has often being noted. Several authorities have split Pseudaelurus into separate genera or subgenera, including Hyperailurictis, Styriofelis, Miopanthera and Schizailurus. These different groups of Pseudaelurus-grade felids are often considered to have given rise to later felid lineages. The genus Styriofelis was originally proposed in 1929 by Kretzoi for the species Pseudaelurus turnaeunsis. Kretzoi also proposed the genus Hyperailurictis for the North American species Pseudaelurus intrepidus, and Miopanthera for Ps. lorteti. In 1964, Beaumont elaborated on Kretzoi's proposal and split Pseudaelurus into three separate genera: Pseudaelurus for the European Ps. quadridentatus, Schizailurus for Ps. lorteti, and Hyperailurictis for Ps. intrepidus. =Taxonomic history= In 1843, the paleontologist de Blainville published a description of a felid cranium and lower jaw fragment from Sansan, France. He assigned these fossils to a new species, Felis quadridentata. The cranium was later reassigned to another species, but in 1850 the lower jaw fragment was assigned to a new genus by Paul Gervais as Pseudaelurus quadridentatus, due to having certain primitive features. In 1858, Joseph Leidy described the species Felis intrepidus, from North America, and reassigned the species as Pseudaelurus intrepidus in 1869. After that discovery, another eight species of Pseudaelurus would be described in North America, but only five are still considered valid. In 1872, Henri Filhol described the species Pseudaelurus edwardsi from France, but the species was reassigned to the nimravid genus Eofelis in 2000. In 1882, a second species from Europe was described as Pseudaelurus turauensis, and a third species, Pseudaelurus lorteti, in 1899. The fourth European species, Pseudaelurus romieviensis, was described in 1934. In addition, the species Pseudaelurus transitorius was described in 1892, but most later authors considered it a synonym of P. turnaeunsis. In 1914, fossils from Africa were described and assigned to the species Pseudaelurus africanus. However, the species was later reassigned to first the genus Metailurus and finally to Afrosmilus. In Asia, the first description of Pseudaelurus was in 1910, when a fragmentary fossil was assigned to Pseudaelurus chinjiensis; however, it was reassigned in 1915 to the new genus Sivaelurus. The next appearance of Pseudaelurus-grade felids in Asia wasn't until 1986, when a lower jaw fragment and some dental fragments were assigned to the species Pseudaelurus lorteti. In 1990, the species Pseudaelurus guangheensis was described. In 1998, a second Asian species, Pseudaelurus cuspidatus, was also described. Both of the Asian species are known only from fragmentary fossils. In 1998, while measuring fragmentary fossils from the Hsanda-Gol locality in Mongolia, Robert Hunt referred a lower jaw fragment to Proailurus sp.; while this was reassigned to the nimravid genus Eofelis in 1999 instead, a 2004 review of felid material from other localities in Mongolia suggested that it could belong to Pseudaelurus cuspidatus instead, on basis of having similar features. However, the Hsanda-Gol specimen is dated back to the Oligocene, while Pseudaelurus cuspidatus is found solely in Miocene-aged localities. The same paper also described a pair of fragments (a lower jaw fragment and a metapodial) and attributed them to Pseudaelurus sp. In 2010, a review of the Felidae as a whole suggested that Pseudaelurus be split into three genera: Hyperailurictis for the five North American species, Styriofelis for two of the European species (P. lorteti and P. turnaunensis), and Pseudaelurus sensu stricto for P. quadridentatus. The status of P. romieviensis, P. guangheensis, and P. cuspidatus was given as uncertain. In addition, Miopanthera and Schizailurus were recognized as junior synonyms of Styriofelis. In 2012, a new species Styriofelis vallesiensis was described based on a specimen found in Spain. However, a review of the species in 2017 concluded that Leptofelis was sufficiently different from other Styriofelis species as to require a separate genus. It was thus reassigned to the new genus Leptofelis as Leptofelis vallesiensis. In 2017, a review of the species Felis pamiri, which was named based on a snout fragment from Turkey and dated to the late Miocene, concluded that Felis pamiri and Pseudaelurus lorteti were likely closely related to each other, and ancestral to the Panthera lineage. Both species were reassigned to the genus Miopanthera as Miopanthera lorteti and Miopanthera pamiri. =Phylogeny= The following cladogram is based on Piras et al. (2013) and illustrates the three more derived lineages that evolved from \\"Pseudaelurus\\" species.

Martinus Willem Beijerinck (, 16 March 1851 ‚Äì 1 January 1931) was a Dutch microbiologist and botanist who was one of the founders of virology and environmental microbiology. Biography Born in Amsterdam, Beijerinck studied at the Technical School of Delft, where he was awarded the degree of Chemical Engineer in 1872. He obtained his Doctor of Science degree from the University of Leiden in 1877. At the time, Delft, then a Polytechnic, did not have the right to confer doctorates, so Leiden did this for them. He became a teacher in microbiology at the Agricultural School in Wageningen (now Wageningen University) and later at the Polytechnische Hogeschool Delft (Delft Polytechnic, currently Delft University of Technology) (from 1895). He established the Delft School of Microbiology. His studies of agricultural and industrial microbiology yielded fundamental discoveries in the field of biology. His achievements have been perhaps unfairly overshadowed by those of his contemporaries, Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur, because unlike them, Beijerinck never studied human disease. In 1885 he became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. Scientific contributions He is considered one of the founders of virology. In 1898, he published results on the filtration experiments demonstrating that tobacco mosaic disease is caused by an infectious agent smaller than a bacterium. Translated into English in Johnson, J., Ed. (1942) Phytopathological classics. (St. Paul, Minnesota: American Phytopathological Society) No. 7, pp. 33‚Äì52 (St. Paul, Minnesota) His results were in accordance with the similar observation made by Dmitri Ivanovsky in 1892. Translated into English in Johnson, J., Ed. (1942) Phytopathological classics (St. Paul, Minnesota: American Phytopathological Society) No. 7, pp. 27‚Äì-30. Like Ivanovsky before him and Adolf Mayer, predecessor at Wageningen, Beijerinck could not culture the filterable infectious agent; however, he concluded that the agent can replicate and multiply in living plants. He named the new pathogen virus to indicate its non-bacterial nature. Beijerinck asserted that the virus was somewhat liquid in nature, calling it \\"contagium vivum fluidum\\" (contagious living fluid). It was not until the first crystals of the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) obtained by Wendell Stanley in 1935, the first electron micrographs of TMV produced in 1939 and the first X-ray crystallographic analysis of TMV performed in 1941 proved that the virus was particulate. Beijerinck also discovered nitrogen fixation,Beijerinck, M.W, 1901, √úber oligonitrophile Mikroben, Centralblatt f√ºr Bakteriologie, Parasitenkunde, Infektionskrankheiten und Hygiene, Abteilung II, Vol 7, pp. 561‚Äì582 the process by which diatomic nitrogen gas is converted to ammonium ions and becomes available to plants. Bacteria perform nitrogen fixation, dwelling inside root nodules of certain plants (legumes). In addition to having discovered a biochemical reaction vital to soil fertility and agriculture, Beijerinck revealed this archetypical example of symbiosis between plants and bacteria. Beijerinck discovered the phenomenon of bacterial sulfate reduction, a form of anaerobic respiration. He learned bacteria could use sulfate as a terminal electron acceptor, instead of oxygen. This discovery has had an important impact on our current understanding of biogeochemical cycles. Spirillum desulfuricans, now known as Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, the first known sulfate-reducing bacterium, was isolated and described by Beijerinck. Beijerinck invented the enrichment culture, a fundamental method of studying microbes from the environment. He is often incorrectly credited with framing the microbial ecology idea that \\"everything is everywhere, but, the environment selects\\", which was stated by Lourens Baas Becking. Personal life Beijerinck was a socially eccentric figure. He was verbally abusive to students, never married, and had few professional collaborations. He was also known for his ascetic lifestyle and his view of science and marriage being incompatible. His low popularity with his students and their parents periodically depressed him, as he very much loved spreading his enthusiasm for biology in the classroom. After his retirement at the Delft School of Microbiology in 1921, at age 70, he moved to Gorssel where he lived for the rest of his life, together with his two sisters. Recognition Beijerinckia (a genus of bacteria), Beijerinckiaceae (a family of Rhizobiales), and Beijerinck (crater) are named after him.

It is the animal from which the subfamily Machairodontinae gets its name and has since become a wastebasket taxon over the years as many genera of sabertooth cat have been and are still occasionally lumped into it. Discovery Early restoration by Lancelot Speed from 1905 depicting Machairodus with tiger-like markings Machairodus was first named in 1832, by German Naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup. Though its remains were known since 1824, it was believed by Georges Cuvier that the fossils had come from a species of bear, which he called Ursus cultridens (known today as Megantereon) based on composite sample of teeth from different countries, species and geologic ages, leading to what would become a long series of complications. Kaup however, recognized the teeth as those of felids and promptly reclassified the existing specimens as Machairodus, including M. cultridens in it. The name quickly gained acceptance and by the end of the 19th Century, many species of felid or related feliform (such as nimravids) were lumped into the genus Machairodus, including but not limited to Sansanosmilus, Megantereon, Paramachairodus, Amphimachairodus, Nimravides, and Homotherium among others. This would eventually turn Machairodus into something of a wastebasket taxon, which would be rectified with the discoveries of more complete skeletons of other machairodonts. Description In general Machairodus was similar in size to a modern lion or tiger, at long and standing about at the shoulder. M. aphanistus from the Mediterranean late Miocene is known to be rather tiger-like in size and skeletal proportions, with a mass of to . It was similar to the related Nimravides of North America. The skeleton also indicates that this species would have possessed good jumping abilities. M. alberdiae was contemporary with M. aphanistus in Cerro de los Batallones fossil deposits and was smaller and more primitive in anatomical features and would not have exceeded . M. horribilis of China is the largest known species of the genus and is comparable in size to the much later Smilodon populator, weighing around . Its skull, measuring upwards of in length, is one of the largest known skulls for any machairodont, with only a recently described S. populator skull rivaling it in size, with the latter cat outweighing M. horribilis at .https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/science/saber-toothed- tiger.html?referringSource=articleShare Overall, the skull of Machairodus was noticeably narrow compared with the skulls of extant pantherine cats, and the orbits were relatively small. The canines were long, thin and flattened from side to side but broad from front to back like the blade of a knife, as in Homotherium. The front and back edges of the canines were serrated when they first grew, but these serrations were worn down in the first few years of the animal's life. Machairodus probably hunted as an ambush predator. Its legs were too short to sustain a long chase, so it most likely was a good jumper, and used its canines to cut open the throat of its prey. Its teeth were rooted to its mouth and were as delicate as those in some related genera, unlike most saber-toothed cats and nimravids of the time, which often had extremely long canines which hung out of their mouths. The fangs of Machairodus, however, were able to more easily fit in its mouth comfortably while being long and effective for hunting. Despite its great size, the largest example of Machairodus, M. horribilis was better equipped to hunt relatively smaller prey than Smilodon, as evidenced by its moderate jaw gape of 70 degrees, similar to the gape of a modern lion. Classification M. aphanistus skeleton from Cerro de los Batallones The fossil species assigned to the genus Machairodus were divided by Turner into two grades of evolutionary development, with M. aphanistus and the North American \\"Nimravides\\" catacopis representing the more primitive grade and M. coloradensis and M. giganteus representing the more derived grade. The characteristics of the more advanced grade include a relative elongation of the forearm and a shortening of the lumbar region of the spine to resemble that in living pantherine cats. Subsequently, the more derived forms were assigned a new genus, Amphimachairodus, which includes M. coloradensis, M. kurteni, M. kabir and M. giganteus. In addition, M. catacopsis was reclassified as N. catacopsis. Paleobiology Restoration Studies of Machairodus indicate that the cat relied predominantly on its neck muscles to make the killing bite applied to its victims. The cervical vertebrae show clear adaptations to making vertical motions in the neck and skull. There are also clear adaptations for precise movements, strength, and flexibility in the neck that show compatibility with the canine-shearing bite technique that machairodontine cats are believed to have performed. These adaptations are believed to have also been partial compensation in this primitive machairodont against the high percentage of canine breakages seen in the genus.https://academic.oup.com/zoolinnean/article- abstract/188/1/319/5581941?redirectedFrom=fulltext Paleoecology Machairodus seemed to prefer open woodland habitat, as evidenced by finds at Cerro de los Batallones, which is of Vallesian age. As a top predator at Batallones, it would have hunted large herbivores of the time. Such herbivores would have included horses like Hipparion, the hornless rhinoceros Aceratherium, the giraffes Deccanatherium and Birgerbohlinia, the deer Euprox and Lucentia, the antelopes Paleoreas, Tragoportax, Miotragocerus and Dorcatherium, the gomphotherid mastodon Tetralophodon, the porcupine Hystrix, and the suid Microstonyx, . Machairodus would have competed for such prey with the Amphicyonid Magericyon, fellow machairodonts Promegantereon and Paramachairodus, bears such as Agriotherium and Indarctos, and the small hyaenid Protictitherium. While Agriotherium and Magericyon would likely have been strongly competitive with Machairodus for food, Promegantereon, Paramachairodus and Protictitherium likely were less potential rivals. Evidence also exists indicating that Machairodus may have been prone to niche partitioning with Magericyon, possibly living in slightly different habitats, with the machairodont preferring more heavily vegetated habitats while the bear-dog hunted in the more open areas. Dietary preferences may also have played a role in the coexistence between these two large predators at Batallones. Based on its jaw gape, the largest species, M. horribilis was probably a hunter of relatively slow-moving horses. Pathology Machairodus aphanistus fossils recovered from Batallones reveal a high percentage of tooth breakages, indicating that unlike later machairodonts, due to a lack of protruding incisors Machairodus often used its sabers to subdue prey in a manner similar to modern cats; this was a more risky strategy that virtually ensured that damage to their saber teeth often occurred.

Fossils very similar to Dinofelis from Lothagam range back to the Late Miocene, some 8 million years ago. Description and ecology In size they were between a modern leopard and a lion, with most about the size of a jaguar (70 cm tall and up to 120 kg), they were medium-sized but powerful cats with a pair of prominent saber teeth. The front limbs were particularly robust compared to modern cats (even the jaguar). Two specimens were examined by Serge Legendre and Claudia Roth for body mass. The first specimen was estimated to weigh , the second . The canine teeth of Dinofelis are longer and more flattened than those of modern cats but less than those of true saber- tooths, hence the designation of Dinofelis and nimravids as \\"false saber- tooth\\" cats. (However, Nimravids are not close relatives of Dinofelis.) While the lower canines are robust, the cheek teeth are not nearly as robust as those of the lion and other modern big cats. Based on Dinofelis' likely preference of forest habitats, ethologist William Allen et al. believes it possessed a spotted or striped coat. Paleobiology Their stout body may indicate a preference for dense or mixed habitats, although, like the modern jaguar, it may have ranged from forest to open country, including wetlands. Analysis of carbon isotope ratios in specimens from Swartkrans indicates that Dinofelis preferentially hunted grazing animals. The main predators of hominids in the environment at that time were most likely leopards and fellow machairodont Megantereon, whose carbon isotope ratios showed more indication of preying on hominids. Dinofelis fossils and bones have been found in South Africa near those of the baboons that it possibly had killed. Bones from several specimens of Dinofelis and baboons were found in a natural trap, where Dinofelis may have been lured to feed on trapped prey. Several sites from South Africa seem to show Dinofelis may have hunted and killed Australopithecus africanus, since the finds mingle fossilized remains of Dinofelis, hominids, and other large contemporary animals. In South Africa, Dinofelis remains have been found near Paranthropus fossil skulls, a few with precisely spaced canine holes in their crania, so it is possible Dinofelis preyed on robust hominids as well. This may been rare, however, as carbon isotope ratios contradict this. It is thought that the gradual disappearance of its forest environment may have contributed to Dinofelis extinction at the start of the ice age. There are indications of other related species..

Though similar cheeses are produced elsewhere, EU law dictates that only those cheeses aged in the natural Combalou caves of Roquefort-sur-Soulzon may bear the name Roquefort, as it is a recognised geographical indication, or has a protected designation of origin. The cheese is white, tangy, crumbly and slightly moist, with distinctive veins of blue mold. It has a characteristic fragrance and flavor with a notable taste of butyric acid; the blue veins provide a sharp tang. It has no rind; the exterior is edible and slightly salty. A typical wheel of Roquefort weighs between , and is about thick. Each kilogram of finished cheese requires about of milk to produce. Roquefort is often called the \\"King of cheeses, though other cheeses share that title. History Legend has it that the cheese was discovered when a youth, eating his lunch of bread and ewes' milk cheese, saw a beautiful girl in the distance. Abandoning his meal in a nearby cave, he ran to meet her. When he returned a few months later, the mold (Penicillium roqueforti) had transformed his plain cheese into Roquefort. Though it is often claimed that Roquefort was praised by Pliny the Elder in AD 79, in fact, Pliny simply speaks of a cheese from Gaul, not mentioning its origin or even saying that it was blue;Howard Belton, A History of the World in Five Menus, n.p. the story was promoted by the Soci√©t√© des Caves.Nelleke Teughels, Peter Scholliers, A Taste of Progress: Food at International and World Exhibitions in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, , p. 186 On 4 June 1411, Charles VI granted a monopoly for the ripening of the cheese to the people of Roquefort-sur-Soulzon as they had been doing for centuries. In 1925, the cheese was the recipient of France's first Appellation d'Origine Contr√¥l√©e when regulations controlling its production and naming were first defined. In 1961, in a landmark ruling that removed imitation, the Tribunal de Grande Instance at Millau decreed that, although the method for the manufacture of the cheese could be followed across the south of France, only those cheeses whose ripening occurred in the natural caves of Mont Combalou in Roquefort- sur-Soulzon were permitted to bear the name Roquefort. Production A Lacaune flock in France A Roquefort farm in Southern France Sheep being milked for Roquefort production The mold that gives Roquefort its distinctive character (Penicillium roqueforti) is found in the soil of the local caves. Traditionally, the cheesemakers extracted it by leaving bread in the caves for six to eight weeks until it was consumed by the mold. The interior of the bread was then dried to produce a powder. In modern times, the mold can be grown in a laboratory, which allows for greater consistency. The mold may either be added to the curd or introduced as an aerosol through holes poked in the rind. Roquefort is made entirely from the milk of the Lacaune breed of sheep. Prior to the AOC regulations of 1925, a small amount of cow's or goat's milk was sometimes added. Around of milk is required to make one kilogram of Roquefort. The cheese is produced throughout the d√©partement of Aveyron and part of the nearby d√©partements of Aude, Loz√®re, Gard, H√©rault and Tarn. , there are seven Roquefort producers. The largest-volume brand by far is Roquefort Soci√©t√© made by the Soci√©t√© des Caves de Roquefort (a subsidiary of Lactalis), which holds several caves and opens its facilities to tourists, and accounts for around 60% of all production. Roquefort Papillon is also a well- known brand. The five other producers, each holding only one cave, are Carles, Gabriel Coulet, Fromageries occitanes, Verni√®res and Le Vieux Berger. Around three million cheeses were made in 2005 (18,830 tons) making it, after Comt√©, France's second most popular cheese. Production of Roquefort cheese entails \\"4,500 people who herd special ewes on 2,100 farms producing milk ... in a carefully defined oval grazing area across the Larzac Plain and up and down nearby hills and valleys.\\" Total production in 2008 of about 19,000 tons was reported. The proportion of Roquefort exported to the United States remained small, only 450 tons out of 3,700 in total exports. Spain, with purchases of 1,000 tons, was by far the largest foreign customer. In early 2009, Susan Schwab, the then-outgoing US Trade Representative, announced a 300% tariff on the cheese, apparently the highest level by far of any in the package of tariffs placed on dozens of European luxury goods in response to a European ban on hormone-treated US beef. The tariff was suspended several months later as the US and EU settled the dispute. =Consumption and other uses= The regional cuisine in and around Aveyron includes many Roquefort-based recipes for main-course meat sauces, savory tarts and quiches, pies, and fillings.Gastronomie du roquefort sur le site roquefort.fr. Consult√© le 25 d√©cembre 2009. Contrary to popular belief, Penicillium roqueforti does not produce penicillin. However, due to the presence of other anti-inflammatory proteins, it was common in country districts for shepherds to apply this cheese to wounds to avoid gangrene. =AOC regulations= The regulations that govern the production of Roquefort have been laid down over a number of decrees by the INAO. These include: #All milk used must be delivered at least 20 days after lambing has taken place. #The sheep must be on pasture, whenever possible, in an area including most of Aveyron and parts of neighboring d√©partements. At least 75% of any grain or fodder fed must come from the area. #The milk must be whole, raw (not heated above , and unfiltered except to remove macroscopic particles. #The addition of rennet must occur within 48 hours of milking. #The Penicillium roqueforti used in the production must be produced in France from the natural caves of Roquefort-sur-Soulzon. #The salting process must be performed using dry salt. #The whole process of maturation, cutting, packaging and refrigeration of the cheese must take place in the commune of Roquefort-sur-Soulzon. =Glutamate content= Roquefort has a high content of free glutamate, 1280 mg per 100 g of cheese. Health According to a 2012 study, Roquefort contains anti-inflammatory compounds. A study from 2013 found that proteins from Roquefort cheese inhibit Chlamydia propagation and LPS (Lipopolysaccharide) leukocyte migration.

It is one of the most famous prehistoric mammals and the best known saber-toothed cat. Although commonly known as the saber-toothed tiger, it was not closely related to the tiger or other modern cats. Smilodon lived in the Americas during the Pleistocene epoch (2.5 mya ‚Äì 10,000 years ago). The genus was named in 1842 based on fossils from Brazil; the generic name means \\"scalpel\\" or \\"two-edged knife\\" combined with \\"tooth\\". Three species are recognized today: S. gracilis, S. fatalis, and S. populator. The two latter species were probably descended from S. gracilis, which itself probably evolved from Megantereon. The hundreds of individuals obtained from the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles constitute the largest collection of Smilodon fossils. Overall, Smilodon was more robustly built than any extant cat, with particularly well- developed forelimbs and exceptionally long upper canine teeth. Its jaw had a bigger gape than that of modern cats, and its upper canines were slender and fragile, being adapted for precision killing. S. gracilis was the smallest species at in weight. S. fatalis had a weight of and height of . Both of these species are mainly known from North America, but remains from South America have also been attributed to them. S. populator from South America was the largest species, at in weight and in height, and was among the largest known felids. The coat pattern of Smilodon is unknown, but it has been artistically restored with plain or spotted patterns. In North America, Smilodon hunted large herbivores such as bison and camels, and it remained successful even when encountering new prey species in South America. Smilodon is thought to have killed its prey by holding it still with its forelimbs and biting it, but it is unclear in what manner the bite itself was delivered. Scientists debate whether Smilodon had a social or a solitary lifestyle; analysis of modern predator behavior as well as of Smilodons fossil remains could be construed to lend support to either view. Smilodon probably lived in closed habitats such as forests and bush, which would have provided cover for ambushing prey. Smilodon died out at the same time that most North and South American megafauna disappeared, about 10,000 years ago. Its reliance on large animals has been proposed as the cause of its extinction, along with climate change and competition with other species, but the exact cause is unknown. Taxonomy S. populator skull and syntype canine from Lund's collection, Zoological Museum, Copenhagen During the 1830s, Danish naturalist Peter Wilhelm Lund and his assistants collected fossils in the calcareous caves near the small town of Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Among the thousands of fossils found, he recognized a few isolated cheek teeth as belonging to a hyena, which he named Hyaena neogaea in 1839. After more material was found (including canine teeth and foot bones), Lund concluded the fossils instead belonged to a distinct genus of felid, though transitional to the hyenas. He stated it would have matched the largest modern predators in size, and was more robust than any modern cat. Lund originally wanted to name the new genus Hyaenodon, but realizing this had recently become preoccupied by another prehistoric predator, he instead named it Smilodon populator in 1842. He explained the Ancient Greek meaning of Smilodon as (smilƒì), \\"scalpel\\" or \\"two- edged knife\\", and ŒøŒ¥œåŒΩœÑŒøœÇ (odont√∫s), \\"tooth\\". This has also been translated as \\"tooth shaped like double-edged knife\\". He explained the species name populator as \\"the destroyer\\", which has also been translated as \\"he who brings devastation\\". By 1846, Lund had acquired nearly every part of the skeleton (from different individuals), and more specimens were found in neighboring countries by other collectors in the following years. Though some later authors used Lund's original species name neogaea instead of populator, it is now considered an invalid nomen nudum (\\"naked name\\"), as it was not accompanied with a proper description and no type specimens were designated. Some South American specimens have been referred to other genera, subgenera, species, and subspecies, such as Smilodontidion riggii, Smilodon (Prosmilodon) ensenadensis, and S. bonaeriensis, but these are now thought to be junior synonyms of S. populator. 1869 lithograph of the holotype molar and maxilla fragment of S. fatalis Fossils of Smilodon were discovered in North America from the second half of the 19th century onwards. In 1869, American paleontologist Joseph Leidy described a maxilla fragment with a molar, which had been discovered in a petroleum bed in Hardin County, Texas. He referred the specimen to the genus Felis (which was then used for most cats, extant as well as extinct) but found it distinct enough to be part of its own subgenus, as F. (Trucifelis) fatalis. The species name means \\"fate\\" or \\"destiny\\", but it is thought Leidy intended it to mean \\"fatal\\". In an 1880 article about extinct American cats, American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope pointed out that the F. fatalis molar was identical to that of Smilodon, and he proposed the new combination S. fatalis. Most North American finds were scanty until excavations began in the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles, where hundreds of individuals of S. fatalis have been found since 1875. S. fatalis has junior synonyms such as S. mercerii, S. floridanus, and S. californicus. American paleontologist Annalisa Berta considered the holotype of S. fatalis too incomplete to be an adequate type specimen, and the species has at times been proposed to be a junior synonym of S. populator. Swedish paleontologists Bj√∂rn Kurt√©n and Lars Werdelin supported the distinctness of the two species in 1990. In his 1880 article about extinct cats, Cope also named a third species of Smilodon, S. gracilis. The species was based on a partial canine, which had been obtained in a cave near the Schuylkill River in Pennsylvania. Cope found the canine to be distinct from that of the other Smilodon species due to its smaller size and more compressed base. Its specific name refers to the species' lighter build. This species is known from fewer and less complete remains than the other members of the genus. S. gracilis has at times been considered part of genera such as Megantereon and Ischyrosmilus. S. populator, S. fatalis and S. gracilis are currently considered the only valid species of Smilodon, and features used to define most of their junior synonyms have been dismissed as variation between individuals of the same species (intraspecific variation). One of the most famous of prehistoric mammals, Smilodon has often been featured in popular media and is the state fossil of California. =Evolution= S. populator skeleton, Museo de La Plata, Buenos Aires Long the most completely known saber-toothed cat, Smilodon is still one of the best-known members of the group, to the point where the two concepts have been confused. The term \\"saber-tooth\\" refers to an ecomorph consisting of various groups of extinct predatory synapsids (mammals and close relatives), which convergently evolved extremely long maxillary canines, as well as adaptations to the skull and skeleton related to their use. This includes members of Gorgonopsia, Thylacosmilidae, Machaeroidinae, Nimravidae, Barbourofelidae, and Machairodontinae. Within the family Felidae (true cats), members of the subfamily Machairodontinae are referred to as saber-toothed cats, and this group is itself divided into three tribes: Metailurini (false saber-tooths); Homotherini (scimitar-toothed cats); and Smilodontini (dirk-toothed cats), to which Smilodon belongs. Members of Smilodontini are defined by their long slender canines with fine to no serrations, whereas Homotherini are typified by shorter, broad, and more flattened canines, with coarser serrations. Members of Metailurini were less specialized and had shorter, less flattened canines, and are not recognized as members of Machairodontinae by some researchers. S. populator canine tooth; the tip points to the right The earliest felids are known from the Oligocene of Europe, such as Proailurus, and the earliest one with saber-tooth features is the Miocene genus Pseudaelurus. The skull and mandible morphology of the earliest saber-toothed cats was similar to that of the modern clouded leopards (Neofelis). The lineage further adapted to the precision killing of large animals by developing elongated canine teeth and wider gapes, in the process sacrificing high bite force. As their canines became longer, the bodies of the cats became more robust for immobilizing prey. In derived smilodontins and homotherins, the lumbar region of the spine and the tail became shortened, as did the hind limbs. Based on mitochondrial DNA sequences extracted from fossils, the lineages of Homotherium and Smilodon are estimated to have diverged about 18 Ma ago. The earliest species of Smilodon is S. gracilis, which existed from 2.5 million to 500,000 years ago (early Blancan to Irvingtonian ages) and was the successor in North America of Megantereon, from which it probably evolved. Megantereon itself had entered North America from Eurasia during the Pliocene, along with Homotherium. S. gracilis reached the northern regions of South America in the Early Pleistocene as part of the Great American Interchange. The younger Smilodon species are probably derived from S. gracilis. S. fatalis existed 1.6 million‚Äì10,000 years ago (late Irvingtonian to Rancholabrean ages), and replaced S. gracilis in North America. S. populator existed 1 million‚Äì10,000 years ago (Ensenadan to Lujanian ages); it occurred in the eastern parts of South America. Despite the colloquial name \\"saber-toothed tiger\\", Smilodon is not closely related to the modern tiger (which belongs in the subfamily Pantherinae), or any other extant felid. A 1992 ancient DNA analysis suggested that Smilodon should be grouped with modern cats (subfamilies Felinae and Pantherinae). A 2005 study found that Smilodon belonged to a separate lineage. A study published in 2006 confirmed this, showing that the Machairodontinae diverged early from the ancestors of modern cats and were not closely related to any living species. The following cladogram based on fossils and DNA analysis shows the placement of Smilodon among extinct and extant felids, after Rinc√≥n and colleagues, 2011: S. populator statue in Tierpark Berlin, Erich Oehme, 1964 Description Size of the three Smilodon species compared to a human Smilodon was around the size of modern big cats, but was more robustly built. It had a reduced lumbar region, high scapula, short tail, and broad limbs with relatively short feet. Smilodon is most famous for its relatively long canine teeth, which are the longest found in the saber-toothed cats, at about long in the largest species, S. populator. The canines were slender and had fine serrations on the front and back side. The skull was robustly proportioned and the muzzle was short and broad. The cheek bones (zygomata) were deep and widely arched, the sagittal crest was prominent, and the frontal region was slightly convex. The mandible had a flange on each side of the front. The upper incisors were large, sharp, and slanted forwards. There was a diastema (gap) between the incisors and molars of the mandible. The lower incisors were broad, recurved, and placed in a straight line across. The p3 premolar tooth of the mandible was present in most early specimens, but lost in later specimens; it was only present in 6% of the La Brea sample. There is some dispute over whether Smilodon was sexually dimorphic. Some studies of S. fatalis fossils have found little difference between the sexes. Conversely, a 2012 study found that, while fossils of S. fatalis show less variation in size among individuals than modern Panthera, they do appear to show the same difference between the sexes in some traits. S. populator restored with plain coat, Charles R. Knight, 1903 S. gracilis was the smallest species, estimated at in weight, about the size of a jaguar. It was similar to its predecessor Megantereon of the same size, but its dentition and skull were more advanced, approaching S. fatalis. S. fatalis was intermediate in size between S. gracilis and S. populator. It ranged from . and reached a shoulder height of and body length of . It was similar to a lion in dimensions, but was more robust and muscular, and therefore had a larger body mass. Its skull was also similar to that of Megantereon, though more massive and with larger canines. S. populator was among the largest known felids, with a body mass range of , and one estimate suggesting up to . A particularly large S. populator skull from Uruguay measuring in length indicates this individual may have weighed as much as . It stood at a shoulder height of . Compared to S. fatalis, S. populator was more robust and had a more elongated and narrow skull with a straighter upper profile, higher positioned nasal bones, a more vertical occiput, more massive metapodials and slightly longer forelimbs relative to hindlimbs. Large tracks from Argentina (for which the ichnotaxon name Smilodonichium has been proposed) have been attributed to S. populator, and measure by . This is larger than tracks of the Bengal tiger, to which the footprints have been compared. S. fatalis restored with spotted coat Traditionally, saber-toothed cats have been artistically restored with external features similar to those of extant felids, by artists such as Charles R. Knight in collaboration with various paleontologists in the early 20th century. In 1969, paleontologist G. J. Miller instead proposed that Smilodon would have looked very different from a typical cat and similar to a bulldog, with a lower lip line (to allow its mouth to open wide without tearing the facial tissues), a more retracted nose and lower-placed ears. Paleoartist Mauricio Ant√≥n and coauthors disputed this in 1998 and maintained that the facial features of Smilodon were overall not very different from those of other cats. Ant√≥n noted that modern animals like the hippopotamus are able to achieve a wide gap without tearing tissue by the moderate folding of the orbicularis oris muscle, and such a muscle configuration exists in modern large felids. Ant√≥n stated that extant phylogenetic bracketing (where the features of the closest extant relatives of a fossil taxon are used as reference) is the most reliable way of restoring the life-appearance of prehistoric animals, and the cat-like Smilodon restorations by Knight are therefore still accurate. Smilodon and other saber- toothed cats have been reconstructed with both plain-colored coats and with spotted patterns (which appears to be the ancestral condition for feliforms), both of which are considered possible. Studies of modern cat species have found that species that live in the open tend to have uniform coats while those that live in more vegetated habitats have more markings, with some exceptions. Some coat features, such as the manes of male lions or the stripes of the tiger, are too unusual to predict from fossils. Paleobiology=Predatory behavior= S. fatalis fighting dire wolves over a Columbian mammoth carcass in the La Brea Tar Pits, Robert Bruce Horsfall, 1913 An apex predator, Smilodon primarily hunted large mammals. Isotopes preserved in the bones of S. fatalis in the La Brea Tar Pits reveal that ruminants like bison (Bison antiquus, which was much larger than the modern American bison) and camels (Camelops) were most commonly taken by the cats there. In addition, isotopes preserved in the tooth enamel of S. gracilis specimens from Florida show that this species fed on the peccary Platygonus and the llama-like Hemiauchenia. In rare cases, Smilodon may have also targeted glyptodonts, based on a Glyptotherium skull that bears elliptical puncture marks consistent with the size and diameter of its canine teeth. This was a juvenile glyptodont with an incompletely developed cephalic shield (head armor). Isotopic studies of dire wolf (Canis dirus) and American lion (Panthera atrox) bones show an overlap with S. fatalis in prey, which suggests that they were competitors. More detailed isotope analysis however, indicates that Smilodon fatalis preferred forest-dwelling prey such as tapirs, deer and forest-dwelling bison as opposed to the dire wolves' preferences for prey inhabiting open areas such grassland. The availability of prey in the Rancho La Brea area was likely comparable to modern East Africa. As Smilodon migrated to South America, its diet changed; bison were absent, the horses and proboscideans were different, and native ungulates such as toxodonts and litopterns were completely unfamiliar, yet S. populator thrived as well there as its relatives in North America. Isotopic analysis for Smilodon populator suggests that its main prey species included Toxodon platensis, Pachyarmatherium, Holmesina, species of the genus Panochthus, Palaeolama, Catonyx, Equus neogeus, and the crocodilian Caiman latirostris. This analysis of its diet also indicates that S. populator hunted both in open and forested habitats. The differences between the North and South American species may be due to the difference in prey between the two continents. Smilodon probably avoided eating bone and would have left enough food for scavengers. Smilodon itself may have scavenged dire wolf kills. It has been suggested that Smilodon was a pure scavenger that used its canines for display to assert dominance over carcasses, but this theory is not supported today as no modern terrestrial mammals are pure scavengers. The brain of Smilodon had sulcal patterns similar to modern cats, which suggests an increased complexity of the regions that control the sense of hearing, sight, and coordination of the limbs. Felid saber-tooths in general had relatively small eyes that were not as forward-facing as those of modern cats, which have good binocular vision to help them move in trees. Smilodon was likely an ambush predator that concealed itself in dense vegetation, as its limb proportions were similar to modern forest dwelling cats, and its short tail would not have helped it balance while running. Unlike its ancestor Megantereon, which was at least partially scansorial and therefore able to climb trees, Smilodon was probably completely terrestrial due to its greater weight and lack of climbing adaptations. The heel bone of Smilodon was fairly long, which suggests it was a good jumper. Its well-developed flexor and extensor muscles in its forearms probably enabled it to pull down, and securely hold down, large prey. Analysis of the cross-sections of S. fatalis humeri indicated that they were strengthened by cortical thickening to such an extent that they would have been able to sustain greater loading than those of extant big cats, or of the extinct American lion. The thickening of S. fatalis femurs was within the range of extant felids. Its canines were fragile and could not have bitten into bone; due to the risk of breaking, these cats had to subdue and restrain their prey with their powerful forelimbs before they could use their canine teeth, and likely used quick slashing or stabbing bites rather than the slow, suffocating bites typically used by modern cats. On rare occasions, as evidenced by fossils, Smilodon was willing to risk biting into bone with its canines. This may have been focused more towards competition such as other Smilodon or potential threats such as other carnivores than on prey. Maximum gape (A) and reconstructions of neck bite in prey of different sizes (B, C) Debate continues as to how Smilodon killed its prey. Traditionally, the most popular theory is that the cat delivered a deep stabbing bite or open-jawed stabbing thrust to the throat, killing the prey very quickly. Another hypothesis suggests that Smilodon targeted the belly of its prey. This is disputed, as the curvature of their prey's belly would likely have prevented the cat from getting a good bite or stab. In regard to how Smilodon delivered its bite, the \\"canine shear-bite\\" hypothesis has been favored, where flexion of the neck and rotation of the skull assisted in biting the prey, but this may be mechanically impossible. The mandibular flanges may have helped resist bending forces when the mandible was pulled against the hide of a prey. The protruding incisors were arranged in an arch, and were used to hold the prey still and stabilize it while the canine bite was delivered. The contact surface between the canine crown and the gum was enlarged, which helped stabilize the tooth and helped the cat sense when the tooth had penetrated to its maximum extent. Since saber-toothed cats generally had a relatively large infraorbital foramen (opening) in the skull, which housed nerves associated with the whiskers, it has been suggested the improved senses would have helped the cats' precision when biting outside their field of vision, and thereby prevent breakage of the canines. The blade-like carnassial teeth were used to cut skin to access the meat, and the reduced molars suggest that they were less adapted for crushing bones than modern cats. As the food of modern cats enters the mouth through the side while cutting with the carnassials, not the front incisors between the canines, the animals do not need to gape widely, so the canines of Smilodon would likewise not have been a hindrance when feeding. La Brea S. fatalis skull cast with jaws at maximum gape Despite being more powerfully built than other large cats, Smilodon had a weaker bite. Modern big cats have more pronounced zygomatic arches, while these were smaller in Smilodon, which restricted the thickness and therefore power of the temporalis muscles and thus reduced Smilodons bite force. Analysis of its narrow jaws indicates that it could produce a bite only a third as strong as that of a lion (the bite force quotient measured for the lion is 112). There seems to be a general rule that the saber-toothed cats with the largest canines had proportionally weaker bites. Analyses of canine bending strength (the ability of the canine teeth to resist bending forces without breaking) and bite forces indicate that the saber-toothed cats' teeth were stronger relative to the bite force than those of modern big cats. In addition, Smilodon gape could have reached almost 120 degrees, while that of the modern lion reaches 65 degrees. This made the gape wide enough to allow Smilodon to grasp large prey despite the long canines. A 2018 study compared the killing behavior of Smilodon fatalis and Homotherium serum, and found that the former had a strong skull with little trabecular bone for a stabbing canine-shear bite, whereas the latter had more trabecular bone and used a clamp and hold style more similar to lions. The two would therefore have held distinct ecological niches. =Natural traps= Mounted skeletons of S. fatalis and a dire wolf near mired Paramylodon Many Smilodon specimens have been excavated from asphalt seeps that acted as natural carnivore traps. Animals were accidentally trapped in the seeps and became bait for predators that came to scavenge, but these were then trapped themselves. The best-known of such traps are at La Brea in Los Angeles, which have produced over 166,000 Smilodon fatalis specimens that form the largest collection in the world. The sediments of the pits there were accumulated 40,000 to 10,000 years ago, in the Late Pleistocene. Though the trapped animals were buried quickly, predators often managed to remove limb bones from them, but they were themselves often trapped and then scavenged by other predators; 90% of the excavated bones belonged to predators. The Talara Tar Seeps in Peru represent a similar scenario, and have also produced fossils of Smilodon. Unlike in La Brea, many of the bones were broken or show signs of weathering. This may have been because the layers were shallower, so the thrashing of trapped animals damaged the bones of previously trapped animals. Many of the carnivores at Talara were juveniles, possibly indicating that inexperienced and less fit animals had a greater chance of being trapped. Though Lund thought accumulations of Smilodon and herbivore fossils in the Lagoa Santa Caves were due to the cats using the caves as dens, these are probably the result of animals dying on the surface, and water currents subsequently dragging their bones to the floor of the cave, but some individuals may also have died after becoming lost in the caves. =Social life= S. fatalis pair approaching a group of Paramylodon, one mired, at the La Brea Tar Pits, Charles R. Knight, 1921 Scientists debate whether Smilodon was social. One study of African predators found that social predators like lions and spotted hyenas respond more to the distress calls of prey than solitary species. Since S. fatalis fossils are common at the La Brea Tar Pits, and were likely attracted by the distress calls of stuck prey, this could mean that this species was social as well. One critical study claims that the study neglects other factors, such as body mass (heavier animals are more likely to get stuck than lighter ones), intelligence (some social animals, like the American lion, may have avoided the tar because they were better able to recognize the hazard), lack of visual and olfactory lures, the type of audio lure, and the length of the distress calls (the actual distress calls of the trapped prey animals would have lasted longer than the calls used in the study). The author of that study ponders what predators would have responded if the recordings were played in India, where the otherwise solitary tigers are known to aggregate around a single carcass. The authors of the original study responded that though effects of the calls in the tar pits and the playback experiments would not be identical, this would not be enough to overturn their conclusions. In addition, they stated that weight and intelligence would not likely affect the results as lighter carnivores are far more numerous than heavy herbivores and the social (and seemingly intelligent) dire wolf is also found in the pits. The structure of the hyoid bones suggest that Smilodon communicated by roaring, like modern big cats. The ability to roar may have implications for their social life. Lion pride attacking an African buffalo in Tanzania; Smilodon may also have hunted in groups Another argument for sociality is based on the healed injuries in several Smilodon fossils, which would suggest that the animals needed others to provide it food. This argument has been questioned, as cats can recover quickly from even severe bone damage and an injured Smilodon could survive if it had access to water. The brain of Smilodon was relatively small compared to other cat species. Some researchers have argued that Smilodon brain would have been too small for it to have been a social animal. An analysis of brain size in living big cats found no correlation between brain size and sociality. Another argument against Smilodon being social is that being an ambush hunter in closed habitat would likely have made group-living unnecessary, as in most modern cats. Yet it has also been proposed that being the largest predator in an environment comparable to the savanna of Africa, Smilodon may have had a social structure similar to modern lions, which possibly live in groups primarily to defend optimal territory from other lions (lions are the only social big cats today). Whether Smilodon was sexually dimorphic has implications for its reproductive behavior. Based on their conclusions that Smilodon fatalis had no sexual dimorphism, Van Valkenburgh and Sacco suggested in 2002 that, if the cats were social, they would likely have lived in monogamous pairs (along with offspring) with no intense competition among males for females. Likewise, Meachen-Samuels and Binder (2010) concluded that aggression between males was less pronounced in S. fatalis than in the American lion. Christiansen and Harris (2012) found that, as S. fatalis did exhibit some sexual dimorphism, there would have been evolutionary selection for competition between males. Some bones show evidence of having been bitten by other Smilodon, possibly the result of territorial battles, competition for breeding rights or over prey. Two S. populator skulls from Argentina show seemingly fatal, unhealed wounds which appear to have been caused by the canines of another Smilodon (though it cannot be ruled out they were caused by kicking prey). If caused by intraspecific fighting, it may also indicate that they had social behavior which could lead to death, as seen in some modern felines (as well as indicating that the canines could penetrate bone). It has been suggested that the exaggerated canines of saber-toothed cats evolved for sexual display and competition, but a statistical study of the correlation between canine and body size in S. populator found no difference in scaling between body and canine size concluded it was more likely they evolved solely for a predatory function. =Development= Undersides of S. fatalis skulls, showing canine replacement, George C. Page Museum Smilodon started developing its adult saber-teeth when the animal turned one-and-a-half years of age, shortly after the completion of the eruption of the cat's baby teeth. Both baby and adult canines would be present side by side in the mouth for an 11-month period, and the muscles used in making the powerful bite were developed at about one-and-a-half years old as well, eight months earlier than in a modern lion. After Smilodon turned around 20 months of age, the infant teeth were shed while the adult canines grew at an average growth rate of per month during a 12-month period. They reached their full size at around 3 years of age, later than for modern species of big cat. Juvenile and adolescent Smilodon specimens are extremely rare at Rancho La Brea, where the study was performed, indicating that they remained hidden or at denning sites during hunts, and depended on parental care while their canines were developing. A 2017 study indicates that juveniles were born with a robust build similar to the adults. Comparison of the bones of juvenile S. fatalis specimens from La Brea with those of the contemporaneous American lion revealed that the two cats shared a similar growth curve. Felid forelimb development during ontogeny (changes during growth) has remained tightly constrained. The curve is similar to that for modern cats such as tigers and cougars, but shifts more towards the robust direction of the axes than is seen in modern felids. =Paleopathology= Several Smilodon fossils show signs of ankylosing spondylitis, hyperostosis and trauma; some also had arthritis, which gave them fused vertebrae. One study of 1,000 Smilodon skulls found that 30% of them had eroded parietal bones, which is where the largest jaw muscles attach. They also showed signs of microfractures, and the weakening and thinning of bones possibly caused by mechanical stress from the constant need to make stabbing motions with the canines. Bony growths where the deltoid muscle inserted in the humerus is a common pathology for a La Brea specimen, which was probably due to repeated strain when Smilodon attempted to pull down prey with its forelimbs. Sternum injuries are also common, probably due to collision with prey. The frequency of trauma in S. fatalis specimens was 4.3%, compared to 2.8% in the dire wolf, which implies the ambush predatory behavior of the former led to greater risk of injury than the pursuit predatory behavior of the latter. Smilodon remains exhibit relatively more shoulder and lumbar vertebrae injuries. Distribution and habitat S. fatalis in climbing posture, Cleveland Museum of Natural History Smilodon lived during the Pleistocene epoch (2.5 mya‚Äì10,000 years ago), and was perhaps the most recent of the saber-toothed cats. It probably lived in closed habitat such as forest or bush. Fossils of the genus have been found throughout the Americas. The habitat of North America varied from subtropical forests and savannah in the south, to treeless mammoth steppes in the north. S. fatalis fossils have been found as far north as Alberta, Canada. The mosaic vegetation of woods, shrubs, and grasses in southwestern North America supported large herbivores such as horses, bison, antelope, deer, camels, mammoths, mastodons, and ground sloths. North America also supported other saber-toothed cats, such as Homotherium and Xenosmilus, as well as other large carnivores including dire wolves, short- faced bear (Arctodus simus) and the American lion. Competition from such carnivores may have prevented North American S. fatalis from attaining the size of South America's S. populator. The similarity in size of S. fatalis and the American lion suggests niche overlap and direct competition between these species, and they appear to have fed on similarly sized prey. S. gracilis entered South America during the early to middle Pleistocene, where it probably gave rise to S. populator, which lived in the eastern part of the continent. S. fatalis also entered western South America in the late Pleistocene, and the two species were thought to be divided by the Andes mountains. However, in 2018, a skull of S. fatalis found in Uruguay east of the Andes was reported, which puts the idea that the two species were allopatric (geographically separated) into question. The American interchange resulted in a mix of native and invasive species sharing the prairies and woodlands in South America; North American herbivores included proboscideans, horses, camelids and deer, South American herbivores included toxodonts, litopterns, ground sloths, and glyptodonts. Native metatherian predators (including the saber-toothed thylacosmilids) had gone extinct by the Pliocene, and were replaced by North American carnivores such as canids, bears, and large cats. S. populator was very successful, while Homotherium never became widespread in South America. The extinction of the thylacosmilids has been attributed to competition with Smilodon, but this is probably incorrect, as they seem to have disappeared before the arrival of the large cats. The phorusrhacid \\"terror birds\\" may have dominated the large predator niche in South America until Smilodon arrived. S. populator may have been able to reach larger size than S. fatalis due to a lack of competition in Pleistocene South America; S. populator arrived after the extinction of Arctotherium angustidens, one of the largest carnivores ever, and could therefore assume the niche of mega-carnivore.Sherani, S. (2016). A new specimen-dependent method of estimating felid body mass (No. e2327v2). PeerJ Preprints. S. populator preferred large prey from open habitats such as grassland and plains, based on evidence gathered from isotope ratios that determined the animal's diet. In this way, the South American Smilodon species was probably similar to the modern lion. S. populator probably competed with the canid Protocyon there, but not with the jaguar, which fed primarily on smaller prey. Extinction 1880 skeletal diagram of S. populator Along with most of the Pleistocene megafauna, Smilodon became extinct 10,000 years ago in the Quaternary extinction event. Its extinction has been linked to the decline and extinction of large herbivores, which were replaced by smaller and more agile ones like deer. Hence, Smilodon could have been too specialized at hunting large prey and may have been unable to adapt. A 2012 study of Smilodon tooth wear found no evidence that they were limited by food resources. Other explanations include climate change and competition with humans (who entered the Americas around the time Smilodon disappeared), or a combination of several factors, all of which apply to the general Pleistocene extinction event, rather than specifically to the extinction of the saber-toothed cats. Some early writers theorized that the last saber-toothed cats, Smilodon and Homotherium, became extinct through competition with the faster and more generalized felids that replaced them. It was even proposed that the saber- toothed predators were inferior to modern cats, as the ever-growing canines were thought to inhibit their owners from feeding properly. Yet fast felids, such as the American lion and the American cheetah, also became extinct during the Late Pleistocene. The fact that saber-teeth evolved many times in unrelated lineages also attests to the success of this feature. The latest Smilodon fatalis specimen recovered from the Rancho La Brea tar pits has been dated to 13,025 years ago. The latest Smilodon populator remains found in the cave of Cueva del Medio, near the town of Soria, northeast √öltima Esperanza Province, Magallanes Region in southernmost Chile have been dated to 10,935‚Äì11,209 years ago. The most recent carbon-14 date for S. fatalis reported was 10,200 years BP for remains from the First American Cave in 1971;https://markgelbart.wordpress.com/2011/07/08/two-new-studies-of- sabertooth-smilodon-fatalis-anatomy/ however, the most recent \\"credible\\" date has been given as 11,130 BP.

It became extinct in Africa some 1.5 million years ago. The most recent Eurasian remains, recovered from what is now the North Sea, have been dated to around 28,000 years BP. In South America it is only known from a few remains in the northern region (Venezuela), from the mid-Pleistocene. Taxonomy and distribution H. serum skull The name Homotherium (Greek: (, 'same') and (, 'beast')) was proposed by Emilio Fabrini (1890), without further explanation, for a new subgenus of Machairodus, whose main distinguishing feature was the presence of a large diastema between the two inferior premolars. The lineage of Homotherium is estimated (based on mitochondrial DNA sequences) to have diverged from that of Smilodon about 18 million years ago. Homotherium probably derived from Machairodus and appeared for the first time at the Miocene‚ÄìPliocene border, about 4 to 5 million years ago.Alan Turner: \\"The Evolution of the guild of larger terrestrial carnivores during the Plio- Pleistocene in Africa\\". Geobios, no 23, fasc. 3, p. 349-368, 1990. During the Pleistocene it occurred in vast parts of Eurasia, North America and until the middle Pleistocene (about 1.5 million years ago) even in Africa. A fossil of H. crenatidens was inadvertently dredged from the bed of the North Sea, which was a flat, low-lying extent of marshy tundra laced with rivers during the last glacial period.(BBC News) Paul Rincon, \\"Big cat fossil found in North Sea\\", 18 November 2008 accessed 18 November 2008 There has also been a discovery of 1.8-million-year-old fossils in Venezuela, indicating that scimitar-toothed cats were able to invade South America along with Smilodon during the Great American Interchange. These remains form the holotype of Homotherium venezuelensis.Rinc√≥n, A., Prevosti, F., & Parra, G. (2011). New saber-toothed cat records (Felidae: Machairodontinae) for the Pleistocene of Venezuela, and the Great American Biotic Interchange Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 31 (2), 468-478 DOI: 10.1080/02724634.2011.550366 How long they lasted in South America is not yet evident. Homotherium survived in Eurasia until about 28,000 years ago. Several Eurasian species have been recognized based mainly on differences in the size and shape of the upper canines and body size: H. latidens, H. nestianus, H. sainzelli, H. crenatidens, H. nihowanensis, and H. ultimum. However, given the range of sizes found in extant large cats, it is likely that they represent a single species, Homotherium latidens. Two species described from early Pleistocene Africa, H. ethiopicum and H. hadarensis‚Äîalso hardly differ from the Eurasian forms. On the African continent the genus disappeared about 1.5 million years ago. In North America a very similar species, H. serum, occurred from the late Pliocene until the late Pleistocene. However, both morphological and genetic data suggest that all late Pleistocene Homotherium individuals worldwide should probably be regarded as members of H. latidens. Remains have been found at various sites between Alaska and Texas. In the southern parts of its range the American Homotherium co-existed with Smilodon; in the northern parts it was the only species of saber-toothed cat. The American Homotherium was originally described by the name Dinobastis. Despite Homotheriums vast range and the large quantity of fossil remains from Eurasia, Africa and North America, complete skeletons of this cat are relatively rare. One of the most famous sites of Homotherium remains is Friesenhahn cave in Texas, where 30 Homotherium skeletons were found, along with hundreds of juvenile mammoths and several dire wolves. The genus Dinobastis was originally named by Cope (1893). Its type is Dinobastis serus. It was synonymized subjectively with Smilodon by Matthew (1910) and later with Homotherium by Churcher (1966), Schultz et al. (1970), Waldrop (1974), Kurt√©n and Anderson (1980), Churcher (1984) and and Carpenter (1988).W. D. Matthew. 1910. Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History 28C. B. Schultz et al. 1970.

Occasional Papers, Museum, Texas Tech University 124 Description H. serum size comparison Homotherium reached at the shoulder and weighed an estimated and was therefore about the size of a male African lion.Sorkin, B. 2008: A biomechanical constraint on body mass in terrestrial mammalian predators.

Compared to more familiar machairodonts, like Smilodon or Megantereon, Homotherium had comparatively shorter upper canines, but these flat, serrated teeth were still longer than those of any living cat. Homotheirum's incisors and lower canines formed a powerful puncturing and gripping device; among living cats, only the tiger (Panthera tigris) has such large incisors, which aid in lifting and carrying prey. The molars of Homotherium were rather weak and not adapted for bone crushing. The skull was longer than in Smilodon and had a well-developed crest, where muscles were attached to power the lower jaw. This jaw had down- turned forward flanges to protect the scimitars. Its large canine teeth were crenulated and designed for slashing rather than purely stabbing. Homotherium had the general appearance of a cat, but had a number of atypical features for a felid. Homotherium had unusual limb proportions, with longer, more robust forelimbs that gave it a hyena-like appearance. The hind quarters were rather squat with feet that may have been partially plantigrade, causing the back to slope towards the short tail. Features of the hind limbs indicate that this cat was moderately capable of leaping. The pelvic region, including the sacral vertebrae, was bear-like, as was the short tail composed of 13 vertebrae‚Äîabout half the number of long-tailed cats'. H. venezuelensis skeleton The unusually large, square nasal opening, similar to that of the cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus), presumably allowed faster oxygen intake, which would have aided in rapid or extended running and in cooling the brain. Again similarly to the cheetah, the visual cortex in Homotherium's brain was large and complex, implying that the scimitar cat relied heavily on vision during the hunt. Based on Homotheriums preference for open habitat such as plains and comparisons with modern cats, it is considered likely by ethologist William Allen et al that Homotherium would have been plainly colored like lions to better camouflage itself. Diet and habitats H. serum restoration The decline of Homotherium could be a result of the disappearance of large herbivorous mammals like mammoths in America at the end of the Pleistocene. In North America fossil remains of Homotherium are less abundant than those of its contemporary Smilodon. For the most part it probably inhabited higher latitudes and altitudes and therefore was likely to be well adapted to the colder conditions of the mammoth steppe environment. The reduced claws, relatively slender limbs, and sloping back all appear to be adaptations for endurance running in open habitats.M. Anton et al.: Co-existence of scimitar- toothed cats, lions and hominins in the European Pleistocene. Implications of the post-cranial anatomy of Homotherium latidens (Owen) for comparative palaeoecology. Quaternary Science Reviews 24 (2004). Genomic analysis vindicates that Homotherium was social and well-adapted to life as a pursuit predator. Genes revealing high genetic diversity indicate the genus was far more common than previously assumed due to the preservation bias of the fossil record. The study also revealed that this genus of machairodont was most likely diurnal, and would have mainly hunted in daylight.https://www.newscientist.com/article/2257509-social-life-of-extinct- sabre-toothed-cat-revealed-by-ancient- dna/?fbclid=IwAR0WzvnLslKn96Kq7gZs_hAx7KLBWA_zA4diIOdLlr5xTYYbEK6-- TobbQ0https://www.cell.com/current- biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(20)31421-4?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0960982220314214%3Fshowall%3Dtrue African Homotherium species seem to have hunted early Pleistocene species of Deinotherium, likely preferring to target the more vulnerable adolescents or calves in a herd. Due to their saber-teeth, an attack on such thick-skinned prey would have likely been significantly easier and less time-consuming compared to a similar hunt on modern elephants by lions. At the well known Friesenhahn Cave site in Texas, the remains of almost 400 juvenile mammoths were discovered along with numerous Homotherium skeletons of all ages, from elderly specimens to cubs. Based on this fossil site, Homotherium was likely a social predator (as further vindicated by genomic analyses) that would have been specialized in hunting young mammoths and that subsequently dragged the kills into secluded caves to eat in relative peace. Homotherium also seemed to have retained the excellent nocturnal vision typical of most cats, and hunting at night in the arctic regions where many Homotherium have been found would have been a prime hunting method. The sloped back and powerful lumbar section of Homotheriums vertebrae suggest a bear-like build, and thus that these animals could have been capable of pulling formidable loads; further, broken upper canines - a common injury in fossils of other machairodonts such as Machairodus and Smilodon that would have resulted from struggling with their prey - is not seen in Homotherium, perhaps because their social groups would completely restrain prey items before any of the cats attempted to kill the target with their saber teeth. Moreover, the bones of the young mammoths found in Friesenhahn Cave show distinctive marks matching the incisors of Homotherium, indicating that they could efficiently process most of the meat on a carcass and that the mammoths had been deposited in the caves by the cats themselves and not by scavengers. Examination of the bones also indicates that the carcasses of these juvenile mammoths were dismembered after being killed by the cats before being dragged away, suggesting that Homotherium would disarticulate their kill to transport it to a safe area such as a hidden lair or den and prevent competitors such as dire wolves and American lions from usurping the carcass.

During his 45 years in the colonies and the newly independent United States, he devoted his life to ministry, traveling on horseback and by carriage thousands of miles to those living on the frontier. Asbury spread Methodism in British colonial America as part of the Second Great Awakening. He also founded several schools during his lifetime, although his own formal education was limited. His journal is valuable to scholars for its account of frontier society, with references to many towns and villages in Colonial America. Clarke, E.T., Manning Potts, T., Payton, Jacob S., Editors. The Journal and Letters of Francis Asbury, Vols. 1-3, Nashville and London, 1958 Biography=Childhood and adolescence= Bishop Asbury Cottage, Asbury's boyhood home at Great Barr Francis Asbury was born at Hamstead Bridge, Staffordshire, England on August 20 or 21, 1745, to Elizabeth and Joseph Asbury. The family moved to a cottage at Great Barr, Sandwell, the next year. His boyhood home still stands and is open as Bishop Asbury Cottage museum. Soon after the family moved to Great Barr, in May 1748, Asbury's older sister, Sarah, died; he was less than three years old. Asbury wrote later that his mother Eliza was \\"very much a woman of the world\\"; with his sister's death, she \\"sank into deep distress....from which she was not relieved for many years,\\" and was living \\"in a very, dark, dark, dark, day and place\\". A few years later she found a renewed Christian faith as itinerant preachers, either Baptist or Methodists, visited Barr on a revival circuit. From then on she began to read the Bible every day and encouraged her son to do so as well.Hallam, David J.A., Eliza Asbury: her cottage and her son, Studley, 2003, pp. 8-9 Eliza's deep faith may not have been shared by her husband, who seemed to have problems, possibly drink or gambling. Francis Asbury described his father as \\"industrious.\\" The husband supported his wife in her faith and witness: he allowed Methodist meetings to be held each Sunday in the cottage. Hallam (2003), Eliza Asbury, p 13. During Asbury's childhood the West Midlands was undergoing massive changes as the industrial revolution swept through the area. Waves of workers migrated into the area, attracted by jobs in the growing factories and workshops in Birmingham and the Black Country of the mines. The Asburys lived in a cottage tied to a public house, on a main route between the mines and the factories. They would have been aware of the drinking, gambling, poverty and poor behaviour prevalent in the area. Hallam (2003),Eliza Asbury, pp 16-20 Francis Asbury attended a local endowed school in Snail's Green, a nearby hamlet. He did not get on well with his fellow pupils who ridiculed him because of his mother's religious beliefs. During the 1740s there had been widespread anti- Methodist rioting in Wednesbury and the surrounding area, and into the 1750s a great deal of persecution. Nor did he like his teacher and left school at the first opportunity.Hallam (2003),Eliza Asbury, pp. 9 and 21 Asbury took a keen interest in religion, having \\"felt something of God as early as the age of seven\\". Hallam (2003), p 40 He lived not far from All Saint's Church, Bromwich, which under the patronage of the Methodist Earl of Dartmouth, provided a living for Evangelical minister Edward Stillinghurst. Well connected, Stillinghurst invited as visiting preachers some of the foremost preachers and theologians of the day. These included John Fletcher, John Ryland, Henry Venn, John Cennick and Benjamin Ingham. His mother encouraged Francis to meet with the Methodists in Wednesbury, eventually joining a \\"band\\" with four other young men who would meet and pray together. For them a typical Sunday would be a preaching meeting at 5.00 am, communion at the parish church mid morning, and attending a preaching meeting again at 5.00 pm. Hallam (2003), pp 22-25 Asbury had his first formal job at age thirteen; he went \\"into service\\" for local gentry, whom he later described as \\"one of the most unGodly families in the parish\\". But he soon left them and is believed to have eventually worked for Thomas Foxall, at the Old Forge Farm,Old Forge Farm where he made metal goods. He became great friends with Foxall's son, Henry.Henry They developed a friendship, which continued after Henry Foxall's emigration to Colonial America. There he continued working with metal and established the Foundry Church in Georgetown, now part of Washington, D.C. Asbury began to preach locally, and eventually became an itinerant preacher on behalf of the Methodist cause.Hallam (2003), p42. Asbury's childhood, and especially his mother's attitudes, have been the subject of some controversy. In 1927 Herbert Asbury, a journalist who claimed to be a relative of Frances Asbury, published A Methodist Saint: The Life of Bishop Asbury, (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, Inc.). Herbert Asbury made a number of claims, quoting 'family legend' about the Asbury family, including one that Francis's mother prayed for him to become Archbishop of Canterbury, that Elizabeth claimed to have been visited by angels, and that Joseph Asbury had previously been married to a Susan Whipple, a farmer's daughter from Wednesbury. Extensive research by local historian David Hallam could find no evidence to support Herbert Asbury's claims, and dismissed his claiming relation to Francis. He noted that Asbury was a common surname in the West Midlands at the time. See Hallam (2003), pp. 14-15. Hallam dismisses a similar claim made by a \\"genealogical study\\" presented by an Asbury family to the Love Lane Methodist Museum in Baltimore. Francis Asbury was the only surviving child of Joseph and Elizabeth; he never married. Birth records during this period in England were of poor quality and claims of any relationship are conjecture. Asbury's preaching ministry in England is detailed in the section below: \\"Asbury's circuits in England\\". =Asbury's work in America= At the age of 22, Asbury's ordination by John Wesley as a traveling preacher became official. Typically such positions were held by young, unmarried men, known as exhorters. In 1771 Asbury volunteered to travel to British North America. His first sermon in the Colonies took place with the Methodist congregation in Woodrow, Staten Island.Morris, Ira. K. \\"Early History of Staten Island\\", Proceedings of the New York State Historical Association, Volume 17, page 198 Within the first 17 days of being in the colonies, Asbury preached in both Philadelphia and New York. During the first year, he served as Wesley's assistant and preached in 25 different settlements. When the American Revolutionary War broke out in 1776, he and James Dempster were the only British Methodist ministers to remain in America.\\"The Story of Barratt's Chapel,\\" accessed 11 September 2015 > \\"During his early years in North America, Asbury devoted his attention > mainly to followers living on the eastern shore between the Delaware River > and the Chesapeake Bay.

Sometimes this had the effect of compromising his parishioners. In 1780, Asbury met the freedman Henry \\"Black Harry\\" Hosier, a meeting the minister believed \\"providentially arranged\\". Hosier served as his driver and guide and, though illiterate, memorized long passages of the Bible as Asbury read them aloud during their travels. Hosier eventually became a famous preacher in his own right, the first African American to preach directly to a white congregation in the United States.Smith, Jessie C. Black Firsts: 4,000 Ground-Breaking and Pioneering Historical Events (3rd ed.), pp. 1820‚Äì1821. \\"Methodists: 1781\\". Canton, Michigan: Visible Ink Press, 2013. Accessed 17 October 2013. The Ordination of Bishop Asbury, an engraving of an 1882 painting of the scene =Consecrated a bishop= In 1784, John Wesley named Asbury and Thomas Coke as co-superintendents of the work in the United States. The Christmas Conference that year marked the beginning of the Methodist Episcopal Church of the United States. It was during this Conference that Asbury was ordained by Coke.Christianity Today: Francis Asbury, accessed 8 July 2016 For the next 32 years, Asbury led all the Methodists in America. However, his leadership did not go unchallenged. His idea for a ruling council was opposed by such notables as William McKendree, Jesse Lee, and James O'Kelly. Eventually, based on advice by Coke, he established in 1792 a General Conference, to which delegates could be sent, as a way of building broader support. =His journeys= Like Wesley, Asbury preached in a myriad of places: courthouses, public houses, tobacco houses, fields, public squares, wherever a crowd assembled to hear him. For the remainder of his life, he rode an average of 6,000 miles each year, preaching virtually every day and conducting meetings and conferences. Under his direction, the church grew from 1,200 to 214,000 members and 700 ordained preachers. Among the men he ordained was Richard Allen in Philadelphia, the first black Methodist minister in the United States who later founded the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the first independent black denomination in the country. Another African American was Daniel Coker, who emigrated to Sierra Leone in 1820 and became the first Methodist minister there from the West. Bishop Asbury also ordained Peter Cartwright in the fall of 1806. Cartwright, Peter. Autobiography of Peter Cartwright: The Backwoods Preacher Pleasant Hills: Self Publication, 1856. Reprint, Columbia: Pantianos Classics, 2019. 48. =A camp meeting= In the fall of 1800, Asbury attended one of the events of the Revival of 1800 as he travelled from Kentucky into Tennessee. The combined Presbyterian and Methodist communion observance made a deep impression on Asbury; it was as an early experience for him of multi-day meetings, which included attendees camping on the grounds or sleeping in their wagons around the meeting house. He recorded the events in his journal: it showed the relation between religious revivalism and camp meetings, later a staple of nineteenth-century frontier Methodism. =Failing health and death= In 1813, Asbury wrote his will. This was a time when \\"the greatest membership gain in the history of the church\\" was achieved.Duren, William Larkin. 1928. Francis Asbury, Founder of American Methodism and Unofficial Minister of State, New York: The Macmillan Company. Pg. xiii In 1814 his health started to fail and he became ill. In 1816 he started to regain strength and continued his preaching journey. He \\"preached his last Sermon in Richmond, Virginia\\" on March 24, \\"and died at the home of George Arnold near Fredericksburg\\" on March 31. =Ability as a preacher= In an exciting time in American history, Asbury was reported to be an extraordinary preacher. Biographer Ezra Squier Tipple wrote: \\"If to speak with authority as the accredited messenger of God; to have credentials which bear the seal of heaven ... if when he lifted the trumpet to his lips the Almighty blew the blast; if to be conscious of an ever-present sense of God, God the Summoner, God the Anointing One, God the Judge, and to project it into speech which would make his hearers tremble, melt them with terror, and cause them to fall as dead men; if to be and do all this would entitle a man to be called a great preacher, then Asbury was a great preacher.\\" Bishop Asbury died in Spotsylvania County, Virginia. He was buried at Mount Olivet Cemetery, in Baltimore, near the graves of Bishops John Emory and Beverly Waugh. Personal habits \\"Francis Asbury had a great distrust of personal popularity, and equally marked distaste of personal publicity\\".Duren, William Larkin. 1928. Francis Asbury, Founder of American Methodism and Unofficial Minister of State, New York: The Macmillan Company. Pg 75 Not being a vain person, he did not care to have his image preserved. He had been in America for 23 years, and a bishop for 10 years before he had let a portrait be made of him. His friend James McCannon persuaded him to have it done. Asbury had had a portrait painted of him for his mother in 1797. His last portrait was made in 1813 by an unknown artist in Strasburgh, Pennsylvania. Asbury had times when he tended to have gloomy thoughts and opinions. He believed himself to be \\"a true prophet of evil tidings, as it suits my cast of mind\\".Duren, William Larkin. 1928. Francis Asbury, Founder of American Methodism and Unofficial Minister of State, New York: The Macmillan Company. Pg 77 Although he was pessimistic, those who knew him considered him an extremely sensitive person. In his journal he recorded more failures and misgivings than success in his ministry. He loved simplicity and had \\"frequent spells of morbid depression\\". He tended to use cynical sarcasm in his preachings. One of the typical prayers he would say, even on his way to America, was \\"Lord, we are in thy hands and in thy work. Thou knowest what is best of us and for thy work; whether plenty or poverty. The hearts of all men are in thy hands. If it is best for us and for thy church that we should be cramped and straitened, let the people's hands and hearts be closed: If it is better for us; for the church,‚Äîand more to thy glory that we should abound in the comforts of life; do thou dispose the hearts of those we serve to give accordingly: and may we learn to be content whether we abound, or suffer need\\".Duren, William Larkin. 1928. Francis Asbury, Founder of American Methodism and Unofficial Minister of State, New York: The Macmillan Company. Pg 119-120 He rose at 5 every morning to read the Bible. He was impatient with those who did not do the tasks assigned to them as soon as the task was assigned. He was \\"one of the wisest and most farseeing men of his day\\".Duren, William Larkin. 1928. Francis Asbury, Founder of American Methodism and Unofficial Minister of State, New York: The Macmillan Company. Pg 167 His journal On September 4, 1771, at the age of 26, Francis Asbury began his journey to Philadelphia from Pill near Bristol. \\"It cost him much to leave home and kindred, as is witnessed by his affectionate letters and sacrificial remittances home: but the call of God was not to be denied\\".Baker, Frank. 1976. From Wesley to Asbury: Studies in Early American Methodism. Durham, NC: Duke University Press. Pg. 115 Before he left, he wrote a letter to his family. \\"I wonder sometimes how anyone will sit to hear me, but the Lord covers my weakness with his power‚Ä¶. I trust you will be easy and more quiet. As for me, I know what I am called to. It is to give up all, and to have my hands and heart in the work, yea, the nearest and dearest friends‚Ä¶. Let others condemn me as being without natural affection, disobedient to parents, or say what they please‚Ä¶. I love my parents and friends, but I love my God better and his service‚Ä¶. And tho' I have given up all, I do not repent, for I have found all\\".Baker, Frank. 1976. From Wesley to Asbury: Studies in Early American Methodism. Durham, NC: Duke University Press. Pg. 113-114 On this voyage he began a journal. \\"In his journal he pours out the feelings and impulses of the moment, but often without giving a clue to either the offender or the offense\\".Duren, William Larkin. 1928. Francis Asbury, Founder of American Methodism and Unofficial Minister of State, New York: The Macmillan Company. Pg. 122 He became seasick for the first week but had recovered. He was \\"poor in material things, but rich in the spiritual atmosphere created and maintained by his mother\\".Baker, Frank. 1976. From Wesley to Asbury: Studies in Early American Methodism. Durham, NC: Duke University Press. Pg 107 He also spent a lot of time studying and reading the Bible and books written by Wesley. On September 22, September 29, and October 6, he preached to the ship's company. Finally, on October 27, he landed at his destination in Philadelphia. His journal also contains some references to opinions of ministers who disagreed with the Methodist leadership, such as Rev. Charles Hopkins of Powhatan County, Virginia who had rejected the Methodist ideals several years before. His journal also frequently mentioned Thomas S. Hinde who was the son of Dr. Thomas Hinde and founder of the city of Mount Carmel, Illinois.The Ladies' repository, Volume 12 (Google eBook),L. Swormstedt and J.H. Power, 1852 Asbury's circuits in England Asbury's travels in America are amply noted in his three-volume journal, The Journal and Letters of Francis Asbury. However, his travels in England are much harder to piece together as very little information exists.\\"Francis Asbury circuits in England\\", The Asbury Triptych Series John Wigger provide some details in American Saint, his biography on Asbury.Wigger, John. American Saint Around 1763, Before this, Asbury began leading the class of about two dozen faithful at the West Bromwich Wesleyan society. In March 1765, his mentor, Wesleyan Alexander Mather asked Asbury to assist him. For the next 11 months, the twenty-year-old Asbury taught and preached around the Staffordshire circuit. The circuit consisted of small Wesleyan societies in West Bromwich, Wednesbury, Walsall, Wolverhampton, and Billbrook. These areas were the foundation of Methodism in the Black Country. During this initial phase of his circuits around England, two Wesleyan preachers offered the majority of the young preachers mentoring. The first was the already mentioned Scottish itinerant, Mather. The second was an English preacher from Bedfordshire, James Glasbrook. These two taught Asbury, John Wesley's basic requirements for a Wesleyan itinerant preacher. In January 1766, Mather offered him the opportunity to quit the forge and join the Wesleyan movement as a full-time itinerant on a trial basis. The twenty-one-year-old Asbury accepted. Part of his training as a full-time traveling preacher required that he read extensively from books suggested by Wesley, who made them available in London, Bristol and Newcastle. The list included several Divinity Books: the Bible, Wesley's tracts, the works of Boehm and Francke. There were also books on Natural Philosophy, Astronomy, History, Poetry and Latin Prose. There were also books on Latin Verse, Greek Prose, including the Greek New Testament, Greek Verse - including Homer's Iliad, and the Hebrew Bible. For the next five months, during his circuits in England Asbury teamed with William Orpe, a young preacher who was the Hebrew teacher at Wesley's Kingswood School in Bristol. They covered the large Staffordshire circuit that encompassed not only Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Willenhall, Walsall, Wednesbury, Darlaston and Billbrook, but also an extended portion to the south in Worcestershire, Tewkesbury and Gloucestershire. Despite his happiness with his new career, Asbury struggled with a sense that his efforts were somewhat limited. He was still living with his parents, he was preaching in places that had heard him preach for the last five years. He looked for more travel and more responsibility. Asbury pressed Mather to assign Asbury to the low round of the Staffordshire circuit, and found it more grueling than he had anticipated. After twelve months Mather sent him home for a short break. Asbury then received instructions to head for London. The London conference of 1767 assigned Asbury to the Bedfordshire circuit. In London, it is likely that Asbury met George Whitefield when he attended worship at Whitefield's Tabernacle. At the time of Asbury's arrival in London, Benjamin Franklin was staying in London and a guest of his friend Whitefield, whom he had met years earlier during one of Whitefield's trips to America. Along with Franklin at Whitefield's home were Connecticut colonial leaders including a Mohegan Indian named Samson Occum and his traveling companion, Princeton College Presbyterian minister, Nathaniel Whitaker, Lord Dartmouth, and the merchant Dennis De Bert. Occum and Whitaker were in England to raise money for their Indian Charity School in Lebanon, Connecticut. Spending a couple months in London before the August conference, it is likely that Asbury not only heard Samson Occum speak at The Tabernacle, but also had opportunity to meet this unique group. August 18, 1767 the conference in London began at John and Charles Wesley's Foundry Church. At this conference, Wesley assigned Asbury to the sprawling Bedfordshire circuit. In addition to Bedfordshire, Asbury was officially admitted on trial and teamed with Bedfordshire native, James Glasbrook. The main locations were Hertford, Luton, Sundon, Millbrook, Bedford, Clifton and Northampton. It was a rural circuit made up of small societies whose total membership was just 208 people.Rodell, Jonathan. \\"Francis Asbury's First Circuit: Bedfordshire, 1767\\", Methodist History(Vol. 42, Issue 2.), UMC, January 1, 2004 In lieu of attending the 1768 conference in Bristol, Asbury is given instructions to wait in London to await his next assignment. Asbury's short stopover in London occurs at the same time that Benjamin Rush is staying with George Whitefield, having completed his medical studies in Edinburgh. After the Bristol conference in August 1768, Wesley assigns Asbury to the only circuit more difficult than the Staffordshire low Round, Colchester. Asbury will preach along the southern coastline of the River Stour, from Manningtree to Harwich. As beautiful as the scenery is, the area sours with rampant smuggling. Asbury is to preach against smuggling. Perhaps out of worry for the young itinerant and the dangerous territory he travels, after two months on the Colchester circuit, Asbury receives word to relocate to the Wiltshire circuit. The three main cities of the Wiltshire circuit are Salisbury, Winchester and Portsmouth. In Portsmouth, it is likely that Asbury began his study of Hebrew through the large Jewish settlement that coexisted with the Portsmouth Methodists. In Portsmouth, the majority of the Jewish settlers reside in Portsea, also known as Portsmouth Common, the same area as the Methodists. For the next ten months, he remains on the Wiltshire circuit. August 10, 1769, word from the Leeds Conference arrives for Asbury in Salisbury. Word from Wesley is that the next circuit is Oxfordshire. There he teams up with his friend from Staffordshire, Richard Whatcoat. In Oxford, Asbury and Whatcoat occasionally preach from St Giles Church. Asbury and Whatcoat remain in Oxford until Christmas. They are both assigned to preach the Bedfordshire circuit in the new year. In addition to returning to Northampton, Asbury will travel to the smaller Wesleyan societies in Towcester and Whittlebury. He also spends time in Weedon. For the next eight months, Asbury will preach on the western portion of the Bedfordshire circuit. In March 1770, Wesley preached at West Bromwich. The news of Wesley draws Asbury to return home after nearly three years away. After his visit home, Asbury returns to the western portion of the Bedfordshire circuit. After the 1770 conference Wesley once again assigns Asbury to Wiltshire. It is during this assignment Asbury is abandoned by his assigned helper, John Catermole, who leaves the Wiltshire circuit after his dealing with a disorderly lay leader who threatens violence to Catermole and Asbury. A visit by Wesley to the struggling Wiltshire circuit results in Wesley asking Asbury to visit the Isle of Wight. It is at the August 1771 conference in Bristol where Asbury volunteers for the circuit simply called, America.

Its goal is to provide regular check-ups that allow doctors or midwives to treat and prevent potential health problems throughout the course of the pregnancy and to promote healthy lifestyles that benefit both mother and child. During check-ups, pregnant women receive medical information over maternal physiological changes in pregnancy, biological changes, and prenatal nutrition including prenatal vitamins. Recommendations on management and healthy lifestyle changes are also made during regular check-ups. The availability of routine prenatal care, including prenatal screening and diagnosis, has played a part in reducing the frequency of maternal death, miscarriages, birth defects, low birth weight, neonatal infections and other preventable health problems. Traditional prenatal care in high-income countries generally consists of: * monthly visits during the first two trimesters (from the 1st week to the 28th week) * fortnightly visits from the 28th week to the 36th week of pregnancy * weekly visits after 36th week to the delivery, from the 38th week to the 42nd week * Assessment of parental needs and family dynamics The traditional form of antenatal care has developed from the early 1900s and there is very little research to suggest that it is the best way of giving antenatal care. Antenatal care can be costly and uses many staff. The following paragraphs describe research on other forms of antenatal care, which may reduce the burden on maternity services in all countries. Visits numbers The WHO recommends that pregnant women should all receive at least eight antenatal visits to spot and treat problems and give immunizations. Although antenatal care is important to improve the health of both mother and baby, many women do not receive eight visits. There is little evidence behind the number of antenatal visits, pregnant women receive and what care and information is given at each visit. It has been suggested that women who have low-risk pregnancies should have fewer antenatal visits. However, when this was tested, women with less visits had babies who were much more likely to be admitted to neonatal intensive care and stay there for longer (though this could down to chance results). 14% more babies died compared with those whose mothers had a standard number of visits. Women who had less antenatal visits were not as satisfied with the care they received compared with women who had the standard number of visits. A new alternative for some of the routine prenatal care visits is Telemedicine. There are many ways of changing health systems to help women access antenatal care, such as new health policies, educating health workers and health service reorganisation. Community interventions to help people change their behavior can also play a part. Examples of interventions are media campaigns reaching many people, enabling communities to take control of their own health, informative-education-communication interventions and financial incentives. A review looking at these interventions found that one intervention helps improve the number of women receiving antenatal care. However interventions used together may reduce baby deaths in pregnancy and early life, lower numbers of low birth weight babies born and improve numbers of women receiving antenatal care. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that in 2015 around 830 women died every day from problems in pregnancy and childbirth . Only 5 lived in high-income countries. The rest lived in low-income countries. A study examined the differences in early and low-weight birth deliveries between local and immigrant women and saw the difference caused by prenatal care received. The study, between 1997 and 2008, looked at 21,708 women giving birth in a region of Spain. The results indicated that very preterm birth (VPTB) and very low birth weight (VLBW) were much more common for immigrants than locals (Castell√≥ et al., 2012). The study showed the importance of prenatal care and how universal prenatal care would help people of all origins get proper care before pregnancy/birth (Castell√≥ et al., 2012). Group versus individual care Group antenatal care has a couple of obvious benefits: it costs less than one-to-one visits and the women have more hours of care as a group than on their own. Only small studies have been conducted looking at group care but they have found that mothers‚Äô knew more about pregnancy, birth and parenting in the group setting. The mothers reported liking the group care and the review found no difference between how the pregnancies developed between the group and individual setting. Midwife-led care Midwife-led care for low-risk women is where a midwife team (and GP if needed) is leading the care a woman receives and she does not usually see a specialist doctor in her pregnancy. Women with midwife-led pregnancies are more likely to give birth without being induced but have natural labours. However they are less likely to have their waters broken, an instrumental delivery, episiotomy or preterm birth. Around the same number of women in each group had a caesarean section. Prenatal examinations At the initial antenatal care visit and with the aid of a special booking checklist the pregnant women become classified into either normal risk or high risk. In many countries, women are given a summary of their case notes including important background information about their pregnancy for example their medical history, growth charts and any scan reports. If the mother goes to a different hospital for care or to give birth the summary of her case notes can be used by the midwives and doctors until her hospital notes arrive. A review looking into women keeping their own case notes shows they have more risk of having a caesarean section. However the women reported feeling more in control having their notes and would like to have them again in future pregnancies. 25% of women reported their hospital notes were lost in hospital though none of the women forgot to take their own notes to any appointments. Prenatal diagnosis or prenatal screening (note that \\"Prenatal Diagnosis\\" and \\"Prenatal Screening\\" refer to two different types of tests) is testing for diseases or conditions in a fetus or embryo before it is born. Obstetricians and midwives have the ability to monitor mother's health and prenatal development during pregnancy through series of regular check-ups. Physical examinations generally consist of: * Collection of (mother's) medical history * Checking (mother's) blood pressure * (Mother's) height and weight * Pelvic exam * Doppler fetal heart rate monitoring * (Mother's) blood and urine tests * Discussion with caregiver In some countries, such as the UK, the symphysial fundal height (SFH) is measured as part of antenatal appointments from 25 weeks gestation. (The SFH is measured from the woman‚Äôs pubic bone to the top of the uterus). A review into this practice found only one piece of research so there is not enough evidence to say whether measuring the SFH helps to detect small or large babies. As measuring the SFH is not costly and is used in many places, the review recommends carrying on this practice. Growth charts are a way of detecting small babies by the measuring the SFH. There are two types of growth chart: #Population based chart which shows a standard growth and size for each baby #Customized growth chart which is worked out by looking at the mother‚Äôs height and weight, and the weights of their previous babies. A review looking into which of these charts detected small babies found that there is no good quality research to show which is best. More research is needed before the customized growth charts are recommended because they cost more money and take more time for the health care workers to make. Obstetric ultrasounds are most commonly performed during the second trimester at approximately week 20. Ultrasounds are considered relatively safe and have been used for over 35 years for monitoring pregnancy. Among other things, ultrasounds are used to: * Diagnose pregnancy (uncommon) * Check for multiple fetuses * Assess possible risks to the mother (e.g., miscarriage, blighted ovum, ectopic pregnancy, or a molar pregnancy condition) * Check for fetal malformation (e.g., club foot, spina bifida, cleft palate, clenched fists) * Determine if an intrauterine growth retardation condition exists * Note the development of fetal body parts (e.g., heart, brain, liver, stomach, skull, other bones) * Check the amniotic fluid and umbilical cord for possible problems * Determine due date (based on measurements and relative developmental progress) Generally an ultrasound is ordered whenever an abnormality is suspected or along a schedule similar to the following: * 7 weeks ‚Äî confirm pregnancy, ensure that it's neither molar or ectopic, determine due date * 13‚Äì14 weeks (some areas) ‚Äî evaluate the possibility of Down syndrome * 18‚Äì20 weeks ‚Äî see the expanded list above * 34 weeks (some areas) ‚Äî evaluate size, verify placental position A review looking at routine ultrasounds past 24 weeks found that there is no evidence to show any benefits to the mother or the baby. Early scans mean that multiple pregnancies can be detected at an early stage of pregnancy and also gives more accurate due dates so that less women are induced who do not need to be. Levels of feedback from the ultrasound can differ. High feedback is when the parents can see the screen and are given a detailed description of what they can see. Low feedback is when the findings are discussed at the end and the parents are given a picture of the ultrasound. The different ways of giving feedback affect how much the parents worry and the mother‚Äôs health behaviour although there is not enough evidence to make clear conclusions. In a small study, mothers receiving high feedback were more likely to stop smoking and drinking alcohol however the quality of the study is low and more research is needed to say for certain which type of feedback is better. Women experiencing a complicated pregnancy may have a test called a Doppler ultrasound to look at the blood flow to their unborn baby. This is performed to detect signs that the baby is not getting a normal blood flow and therefore is ‚Äòat risk‚Äô. A review looked at performing Doppler ultrasounds on all women even if they were at ‚Äòlow-risk‚Äô of having complications. The review found that routine Doppler ultrasounds may have reduced preventable numbers of baby deaths but the evidence was not strong enough to recommend that they should be made routine for all pregnant women. United States Proper prenatal care affects all women of various social backgrounds. While availability of such services have considerable personal health and social benefits, socioeconomic problems prevent its universal adoption in both developing and developed nations, such as the US. Although women can benefit by utilizing prenatal care services, there exists various levels of health care accessibility between different demographics throughout the United States.

Nothing is known of his life or station beyond what is contained in his two surviving works: Epitoma rei militaris (also referred to as De re militari), and the lesser-known Digesta Artis Mulomedicinae, a guide to veterinary medicine. He identifies himself in the opening of his work Epitoma rei militaris as a Christian. Dating of work The latest event alluded to in his Epitoma rei militaris is the death of the Emperor Gratian (383); the earliest attestation of the work is a subscriptio by Flavius Eutropius, writing in Constantinople in 450, which appears in one of two families of manuscripts, suggesting that a division of the manuscript tradition had already occurred. Despite Eutropius' location in Constantinople, the scholarly consensus is that Vegetius wrote in the Western Roman Empire.Walter Goffart. The date and purposes of Vegetius' De Re Militari. In Rome's Fall and After, chapter 3, pp 49-80. Hambledon Press 1989. Vegetius dedicates his work to the reigning emperor, who is identified as Theodosius, ad Theodosium imperatorem, in the manuscript family that was not edited in 450; the identity is disputed: some scholars identify him with Theodosius the Great,N.P. Milner sets forth the argument for Theodosius in Vegetius: Epitome of Military Science, second edition (Liverpool: University Press, 1996), pp. xxxvii ff; T. D. Barnes, \\"The Date of Vegetius\\" Phoenix 33.3 (Autumn 1979), pp. 254‚Äì257, makes the case for Theodosius. while others follow Otto SeeckSeeck, \\"Die Zeit des Vegetius\\", Hermes 11 (1876), 61‚Äì83. Seeck's conclusions changed the mind of Karl Lang, who twice edited the Teubner De re militaria, and adopted Seeck's ascription. and identify him with the later Valentinian III, dating the work to 430-35.G. R. Watson, The Roman Soldier (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1969), p. 26. Goffart agrees that the later date is likely, suggesting that the work may have been intended to support a military revival in the time of Aetius's supremacy.Walter Goffart. The date and purposes of Vegetius' De Re Militari. In Rome's Fall and After, chapter 3, pp 49-80. Hambledon Press 1989.  Epitoma rei militaris  Vegetius' epitome mainly focuses on military organization and how to react to certain occasions in war. Vegetius explains how one should fortify and organize a camp, how to train troops, how to handle undisciplined troops, how to handle a battle engagement, how to march, formation gauge and many other useful methods of promoting organization and valour in the legion. As G. R. Watson observes, Vegetius' Epitoma \\"is the only ancient manual of Roman military institutions to have survived intact\\". Despite this, Watson doubts its value, for Vegetius \\"was neither a historian nor a soldier: his work is a compilation carelessly constructed from material of all ages, a congeries of inconsistencies\\".Watson, The Roman Soldier, pp. 25f These antiquarian sources, according to his own statement, were Cato the Elder, Cornelius Celsus, Frontinus, Paternus and the imperial constitutions of Augustus, Trajan, and Hadrian (1.8). The first book is a plea for army reform; it vividly portrays the military decadence of the Late Roman Empire. Vegetius also describes in detail the organisation, training and equipment of the army of the early Empire. The third book contains a series of military maxims, which were (appropriately enough, considering the similarity in the military conditions of the two ages) the foundation of military learning for every European commander from William the Silent to Frederick the Great. His book on siegecraft contains the best description of Late Empire and Medieval siege machines. Among other things, it shows details of the siege engine called the onager, which afterwards played a great part in sieges until the development of modern cannonry. The fifth book gives an account of the materiel and personnel of the Roman navy. According to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition, \\"In manuscript, Vegetius' work had a great vogue from its first advent. Its rules of siegecraft were much studied in the Middle Ages.\\" N.P. Milner observes that it was \\"one of the most popular Latin technical works from Antiquity, rivalling the elder Pliny's Natural History in the number of surviving copies dating from before AD 1300.\\"Milner, Vegetius, p. xiii It was translated into English, French (by Jean de Meun and others), Italian (by the Florentine judge Bono Giamboni and others), Catalan, Spanish, Czech, and Yiddish before the invention of printing. The first printed editions are ascribed to Utrecht (1473), Cologne (1476), Paris (1478), Rome (in Veteres de re mil. scriptores, 1487), and Pisa (1488). A German translation by Ludwig Hohenwang appeared at Ulm in 1475. However, from that point Vegetius' position as the premier military authority began to decline, as ancient historians such as Polybius became available. Niccol√≤ Machiavelli attempted to address Vegetius' defects in his L'arte della Guerra (Florence, 1521), with heavy use of Polybius, Frontinus, and Livy, but Justus Lipsius' accusation that he confused the institutions of diverse periods of the Roman Empire and G. Stewechius' opinion that the survival of Vegetius' work led to the loss of his named sources were more typical of the late Renaissance.Milner, Vegetius, pp. xiiif. While as late as the 18th century a soldier such as Marshal Puysegur based his own works on this acknowledged model, in Milner's words, Vegetius' work suffered \\"a long period of deepening neglect\\".Milner, Vegetius, p. xiv. Vegetius emphasizes the shortcomings of the Roman Army in his lifetime. To do this, he eulogises the army of the early Empire. In particular, he stresses the high standard of the legionaries and the excellence of the training and the officer corps. In reality, Vegetius probably describes an ideal rather than the reality. The army of the early Empire was a formidable fighting force, but it probably was not in its entirety quite as good as Vegetius describes. In particular, the 5-foot-10-inch minimum height identified by Vegetius would have excluded the majority of the men in Roman times (the Roman foot was and inch was , hence a 5'10\\" Roman was , which is just above average height of Roman (Italian) men of the time from skeletal evidence from Herculaneum in 79 AD). The emperor Valentinian (364‚Äì375) lowered the height minimum to 5' 7\\" Roman which equals . Despite the romanticism extolling the idealized virtues of the Roman legion of an earlier time, Vegetius' De Re Militari remains a reliable and useful insight into the success of the early Roman Empire. Career and background Rosenbaum uses allusions from Vegetius's works and relationships to the work of Merobaudes to suggest that Vegetius was a senior court official, primiscrinius to the praetorian prefect, who had been an agens in rebus, and that he wrote in the early 430s.Rosenbaum, S; \\"Who was Vegetius?\\" published on Academia.edu 2015 https://www.academia.edu/5496690/Who_was_Vegetius ReferencesTranslations *Military Institutions of Vegetius, translated with a preface and notes by Lieutenant John Clarke, London, 1767.

F√ºrst von LigneDer F√ºrst von Ligne und die Hohenzollern by Otto Tschirch, page 9 (in German) (also known as Karl F√ºrst von Ligne or F√ºrst de LigneKarl F√ºrst von Ligne, at bezirksmuseum.at): (23 May 1735 ‚Äì 13 December 1814) was a Field Marshal, inhaber of an infantry regiment, prolific writer, intellectual, member of the princely family of Ligne. He fought as a field officer during several famous battles during the Seven Years' War and briefly returned to military duty in the War of the Bavarian Succession. He performed an important diplomatic mission to Catherine the Great in 1787 and led troops against the Ottoman Empire at Belgrade in 1789. Beginning in the 1770s, he authored an impressive volume of work. After his estates in the Austrian Netherlands were lost to France during the War of the First Coalition, he lived in Vienna. All three of his sons died before him, but his wife and four daughters all outlived him. His grandson, the 8th Prince, became a Belgian statesman. Military service Prince Charles-Joseph de Ligne was born in Brussels, Austrian Netherlands, the son of Field Marshal Claude Lamoral, 6th Prince of Ligne and Princess Elisabeth Alexandrina zu Salm, daughter of Ludwig Otto, 55th Prince zu Salm and his wife Princess Albertine of Nassau-Hadamar. As an Austrian subject he entered the imperial army at an early age. He distinguished himself by his valor in the Seven Years' War, notably at Breslau, Leuthen, Hochkirch and Maxen. A young captain at Leuthen, he found himself suddenly in command of 200 men, the battalion colonels and majors having been killed, and led them to shelter from Prussian cannon fire beside a windmill; subsequently, he participated in the retreat to K√∂nigsburg.J. F. C. Fuller, A Military History of the Western World, Da Capo Press, 1987, p. 212‚Äì215. During the Seven Years' War, De Ligne was promoted Major in 1757, Oberstleutnant in 1758, and Oberst (colonel) in 1759. He was named General- major on 23 April 1764 and Feldmarschall-Leutnant on 1 May 1773. He was awarded the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1772. He was appointed Inhaber (proprietor) of Infantry Regiment Nr. 30 in 1771, the successor to Prince William Carl Christian of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. He became the intimate friend and counselor of Emperor Joseph II, and, inheriting his father's vast estates, lived in the greatest splendor and luxury until the War of the Bavarian Succession brought him again into active service. In 1778, De Ligne was impressed by a captured Prussian officer Flemming von Hagen, who was asked about his girl friends by his captors and replied, \\"I love nothing more dearly than my sword\\". He wished that more Austrian officers were as serious about their military profession. King Frederick the Great of Prussia built a number of palaces and other buildings in Potsdam, but upon closer inspection, the place had a seedy appearance. De Ligne wrote that Frederick had a chance to do something new in Potsdam, but \\"he believed that he could bend Nature to his will by the force of his intellect, in the same way as he attained his victories, and managed war, politics, population, finances and industries. But Nature has a way of laughing at heroes. She prefers a Somerset farmer\\". This war was short and uneventful, and the prince then traveled in England, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and France, devoting himself impartially to the courts, the camps, the salons and the learned assemblies of philosophers and scientists in each country. He developed a great admiration for Frederick the Great, even to the point of justifying his seizure of Silesia. De Ligne was promoted to Feldzeugmeister (full general) on 8 September 1787. He earned the Commander's Cross of the Order of Maria Theresa on 12 October 1789. In 1787 he was with Catherine II in Russia and accompanied her in her journey to the Crimea. In 1789 he was present at the Siege of Belgrade. Shortly after the siege of Belgrade, he was invited to place himself at the head of the Belgian revolutionary movement, in which one of his sons and many of his relatives were prominent, but declined with great courtesy, saying that \\"he never revolted in the winter.\\" Though suspected by Joseph of collusion with the rebels, the two friends were not long estranged, and after the death of the emperor the prince remained in Vienna. His Brabant estates were overrun by the French in 1792‚Äì93, and his eldest son killed in action at La Croix-du Bois in the Argonne (14 September 1792). He was given an honorary command at court. Later life De Ligne served as Captain of the Trabanten Life Guard (Gentlemen at Arms) and the Hofburgwache (Palace Bodyguard) from 13 June 1807 until his death. He received promotion to Feldmarschall on 6 September 1808. Despite the loss of his estates, Charles-Joseph lived in comparative luxury in his later life, and devoted himself to his literary work. He lived long enough to characterize the proceedings of the Congress of Vienna with the famous mot: \\"Le Congr√®s ne marche pas, il danse.\\" (The Congress does not march, it dances.)\\"Vienne (Congres de)\\", Encyclop√¶dia Universalis. He has been described as one of the most charming men who ever lived. He died, aged 79, in Vienna in December 1814 and was buried at the Kahlenberg cemetery.Karl F√ºrst von Ligne, at bezirksmuseum.at In 1815, the proprietorship of Infantry Regiment Nr. 30 passed to Laval Nugent von Westmeath. Collected works Charles-Joseph de Ligne, c. 1807 His collected works appeared in thirty-four volumes at Vienna during the last years of his life (M√©langes militaires, litt√©raires, sentimentaires), and he bequeathed his manuscripts to the emperor's Trabant Guard, of which he was captain (≈íuvres posthumes, Dresden and Vienna, 1817). Selections were published in French, German and English: * ≈íuvres choisies de M. le prince de Ligne (Paris, 1809) * Lettres et pens√©es du Mar√©chal Prince de Ligne, ed. by Madame de Sta√´l-Holstein (1809) * ' (Brussels, 1859) * Des Prinzen Karl von Ligne milit√§rische Werke, ed. Count Pappenheim (Sulzbach, 1814) * Memoir of Charles-Joseph, Prince de Ligne, ed. Katharine Prescott Wormeley (Boston, 1902) The most important of his numerous works on all military subjects is the Fantaisies et pr√©juge's militaires, which originally appeared in 1780. A modern edition is that published by J Dumaine (Paris, 1879). A German version (Miltarische Vorurtheile und Phantasien, etc.) appeared as early as 1783. This work, though it deals lightly and cavalierly with the most important subjects (the prince even proposes to found an international academy of the art of war, wherein the reputation of generals could be impartially weighed), is a military classic, and indispensable to the students of the post-Frederician period. On the whole, it may be said that the prince adhered to the school of Guibert, and a full discussion will be found in Max Jahns' Gesch. d. Kriegswissenschaften. Another very celebrated work by the prince is the mock autobiography of Prince Eug√®ne of Savoy (1809). Other works of his include: * Lettres √† Eug√©nie sur les spectacles (1774) * C√©phalide, ou les Autres mariages samnites, com√©die en musique (1777) * Pr√©jug√©s et Fantaisies militaires (1780) * Colette et Lucas, com√©die en musique (1781) * Coup d'≈ìil sur Bel≈ìil (1781) * Fantaisies militaires (1783) * L'Amant ridicule, proverbe en prose (1787) * M√©langes militaires, litt√©raires et sentimentaires (1795‚Äì1811) * M√©moires sur les Juifs (1795‚Äì1811) * Les Embarras, pi√®ce en un acte (manuscrit) * Contes immoraux Marriage and issue Eugene, 8th Prince of Ligne, grandson On 6 August 1755, in Valtice or Feldsberg, Charles-Joseph married Princess Franziska Xaveria Maria of Liechtenstein (Vienna, 27 November 1739 ‚Äì Vienna, 17 May 1821), sister of Franz Joseph I, Prince of Liechtenstein. The couple had seven children. * Princess Marie Christine Leopoldine (25 May 1757 Brussels ‚Äì 13 September 1830 Teplice) * Prince Charles Antoine Joseph Emanuel (25 September 1759 Brussels ‚Äì 14 September 1792) * Prince Francois Leopold (3 November 1764 ‚Äì 6 January 1771) * Prince Louis Eugene Marie Lamoral (7 May 1766 Brussels ‚Äì 10 May 1813 Brussels) * Prince Adalbert Xavier (26 August 1767 ‚Äì 23 May 1771) * Princess Euphemie Christine Philippine (18 July 1773 Brussels ‚Äì 30 March 1834 Vienna) * Princess Flore Adelaide Caroline (8 November 1775 Brussels ‚Äì 9 December 1851 Vienna) He also had two illegitimate daughters: \\"Ad√®le\\" (1809‚Äì1810) by Adelaide Fleury; and another one (?) (1770‚Äì1770) by Ang√©lique d'Hannetaire (1749‚Äì1822). Charles-Joseph legitimated in 1810 the illegitimate beloved daughter of his son Charles, called \\"Fanny-Christine\\" (4 January 1788 ‚Äì 19 May 1867). She is called \\"Titine\\" in the diaries and letters of the family; she married Maurice O'Donnell von Tyrconnell (1780‚Äì1843). His grandson, Eug√®ne, 8th Prince de Ligne (1804‚Äì1880), was a distinguished Belgian statesman, and another grandson, Count Maximilian O'Donnell von Tyrconnell (1812‚Äì1895), helped save the life of Emperor Franz Josef I of Austria in Vienna in 1853.

Born at Montauban, he accompanied his father in wars before he became a general himself. In 1770, he published an essay on tactics which was very influential in his time. Biography He was born at Montauban, and at the age of thirteen accompanied his father, Charles-Beno√Æt, comte de Guibert (1715‚Äì1786), chief of staff to Mar√©chal de Broglie, throughout the Seven Years' War in Germany, and was awarded the cross of St Louis and then promoted to the rank of colonel in the expedition to Corsica (1767). In 1773 he visited Germany and was present at the Prussian regimental drills and army man≈ìuvres; Frederick the Great, recognizing Guibert's ability, showed great favour to the young comte and freely discussed military questions with him. Guibert's Journal d'un voyage en Allemagne was published, with a memoir, by Toulongeon (Paris, 1803). His D√©fense du syst√®me de guerre moderne, a reply to his many critics (Neuch√¢tel, 1779) is a reasoned and scientific defence of the Prussian method of tactics, which formed the basis of his work when in 1775 he began to co-operate with the count de Saint- Germain in a series of much-needed and successful reforms in the French army. During those years, he also won the love of Julie de Lespinasse, whose love letters to him, later published, are still read today. In 1777, however, Saint-Germain fell into disgrace, and his fall involved that of Guibert who was promoted to the rank of mar√©chal de camp and relegated to a provincial staff appointment. In his semi-retirement he vigorously defended his old chief Saint-Germain against his detractors. On the eve of the Revolution he was recalled to the War Office, but in his turn he became the object of attack and he died, practically of disappointment, on 6 May 1790. Writings In 1770 he published his Essai g√©n√©ral de tactique in London, and this celebrated work appeared in numerous subsequent editions and in English, German and even Persian translations (extracts also in Liskenne and Sauvan, Bibl. historique et militaire, Paris, 1845). Of this work (for a detailed critique of which see Max Jahns, Gesch. d. Kriegswissenschaften, vol. iii. pp. 2058‚Äì2070 and references therein) it may be said that it was the best essay on war produced by a soldier during a period in which tactics were discussed even in the salon and military literature was more abundant than at any time up to 1871. Apart from technical questions, in which Guibert's enlightened conservatism stands in marked contrast to the doctrinaire progressiveness of Mesnil-Durand, Folard and others, the book is chiefly valued for its broad outlook on the state of Europe, especially of military Europe in the period 1763‚Äì1792. One quotation may be given as being a most remarkable prophecy of the impending revolution in the art of war, a revolution which the \\"advanced\\" tacticians themselves scarcely foresaw. \\"The standing armies, while a burden on the people, are inadequate for the achievement of great and decisive results in war, and meanwhile the mass of the people, untrained in arms, degenerates. ... The hegemony over Europe will fall to that nation which ... becomes possessed of manly virtues and creates a national army\\"‚Äîa prediction fulfilled almost to the letter within twenty years of Guibert's death. Other works of Guibert, besides those mentioned, are: Observations sur la constitution politique et militaire des arm√©es de S. M. Prussienne (Amsterdam, 1778), Eloges of Marshal Catinat (1775), of Michel de l'H√¥pital (1778), and of Frederick the Great (1787). Guibert was a member of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise from 1786, and he also wrote a tragedy, Le Conn√©table de Bourbon (1775) and a journal of travels in France and Switzerland. His final work was De la force publique consid√©r√©e par tous ses rapports (Paris: Didot l'a√Æn√©, 1790) in which he contradicted several of the postulates on militias and professional armies. Guibert's writing on the subject - pondering the advantages and disadvantages of militias/conscript armies and mercenaries/professional forces until this day cover most fundamental arguments on the subject.

In 1760, he won an action at the Korbach, but was defeated at Villinghausen in 1761. After the war, he fell into disgrace and was not recalled to active employment until 1778, when he was given command of the troops designed to operate against Great Britain, when France intervened on the Thirteen Colonies' side during the American war of independence. He played a prominent part in the French Revolution, which he opposed with determination; he commanded troops at Versailles in July 1789 and briefly served as Louis XVI's minister of war before fleeing France. After his emigration, the duc de Broglie commanded the Army of the Princes for a short time (1792). Since the duke's eldest son, Charles-Louis-Victor, prince de Broglie, died in the Terror, the succession fell to his grandson, who became the third duc de Broglie. He died at M√ºnster in 1804.

It is \\"suspended between the mundane and the miraculous\\".Allchin, Douglas, \\"Monsters & Marvels: How Do We Interpret the \\"Preternatural\\"?\\", The American Biology Teacher, November 2007. p.565. In theology, the term is often used to distinguish marvels or deceptive trickery, often attributed to witchcraft or demons, from the purely divine power of the genuinely supernatural to violate the laws of nature. In the early modern period, the term was used by scientists to refer to abnormalities and strange phenomena of various kinds that seemed to depart from the norms of nature. Theology Medieval theologians made a clear distinction between the natural, the preternatural and the supernatural. Thomas Aquinas argued that the supernatural consists in \\"God‚Äôs unmediated actions\\"; the natural is \\"what happens always or most of the time\\"; and the preternatural is \\"what happens rarely, but nonetheless by the agency of created beings ... Marvels belong, properly speaking, to the realm of the preternatural.\\"Israel Burshatin, \\"Elena Alias Elewno: Genders, sexualities, and 'race' in the mirror of natural history in sixteenth-century Spain\\" in Sabrina Petra Ramet, Gender Reversals and Gender Cultures: Anthropological and Historical Perspectives, Routledge, New York, 1996, p.114. Theologians, following Aquinas, argued that only God had the power to disregard the laws of nature that he has created, but that demons could manipulate the laws of nature by a form of trickery, to deceive the unwary into believing they had experienced real miracles. According to historian Lorraine Daston, By the 16th century, the term \\"preternatural\\" was increasingly used to refer to demonic activity comparable to the use of magic by human adepts: The Devil, \\"being a natural Magician ... may perform many acts in ways above our knowledge, though not transcending our natural power.\\" According to the philosophy of the time, preternatural phenomena were not contrary to divine law, but used hidden, or occult powers that violated the normal pattern of natural phenomena. Science With the emergence of early modern science, the concept of the preternatural increasingly came to be used to refer to strange or abnormal phenomena that seemed to violate the normal working of nature, but which were not associated with magic and witchcraft. This was a development of the idea that preternatural phenomena were fake miracles. As Daston puts it, \\"To simplify the historical sequence somewhat: first, preternatural phenomena were demonized and thereby incidentally naturalized; then the demons were deleted, leaving only the natural causes.\\" The use of the term was especially common in medicine, for example in John Brown's A Compleat Treatise of Preternatural Tumours (1678), or William Smellie's A Collection of Preternatural Cases and Observations in Midwifery (1754).Samuel J. Rogal, Medicine in Great Britain from the Restoration to the Nineteenth Century, 1660‚Äì1800: An Annotated Bibliography, Greenwood Press, New York, 1992, p.203. In the 19th century the term was appropriated in anthropology to refer to folk beliefs about fairies, trolls and other such creatures which were not thought of as demonic, but which were perceived to affect the natural world in unpredictable ways. According to Thorstein Veblen, such preternatural agents were often thought of as forces somewhere between supernatural beings and material processes. \\"The preternatural agency is not necessarily conceived to be a personal agent in the full sense, but it is an agency which partakes of the attributes of personality to the extent of somewhat arbitrarily influencing the outcome of any enterprise, and especially of any contest.\\"Veblen, T., The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study of Institutions, Macmillan, New York, 1915, p.280 The linguistic association between individual agents and unexplained or unfortunate circumstances remains. Many people attribute occurrences that are known to be material processes, such as \\"gremlins in the engine\\", a \\"ghost in the machine\\", or attributing motives to objects: \\"the clouds are threatening\\". The anthropomorphism in our daily life is a combination of the above cultural stems, as well as the manifestation of our pattern-projecting minds.

He entered the army at an early age, and had a varied career of active service before he was made, at the age of twenty-three, lieutenant- colonel of the king's regiment of cavalry. =Career= He served continuously in the War of the Spanish Succession and was present at Malplaquet. He was made lieutenant-general in 1710, and served with Villars in the last campaign of the war and at the Battle of Denain. During the peace he continued in military employment, and in 1719 he was made director-general of cavalry and dragoons. He was also employed in diplomatic missions and was ambassador in England in 1724. The war in Italy called him into the field again in 1733, and in the following year he was made marshal of France. In the campaign of 1734 he was one of the chief commanders on the French side, and he fought the Battles of Parma and Guastalla. A famous episode was his narrow personal escape when his quarters on the Secchia (battle of Quistello) were raided by the enemy on the night of 14 September 1734. In 1735 he directed a war of positions with credit, but he was soon replaced by Marshal de Noailles. He was governor-general of Alsace when Frederick the Great paid a secret visit to Strasbourg in 1740. In 1742, during the War of the Austrian Succession, Broglie was appointed to command the French army in Germany, but the only success obtained was in the action of Sahay (25 May 1742), for which he was created duc de Broglie and made a peer of France.

It is produced in the chief cells of the stomach lining and is one of the main digestive enzymes in the digestive systems of humans and many other animals, where it helps digest the proteins in food. Pepsin is an aspartic protease, using a catalytic aspartate in its active site. It is one of three principal proteases in the human digestive system, the other two being chymotrypsin and trypsin. During the process of digestion, these enzymes, each of which is specialized in severing links between particular types of amino acids, collaborate to break down dietary proteins into their components, i.e., peptides and amino acids, which can be readily absorbed by the small intestine. The cleavage specificity of pepsin is broad, but some amino acids like tyrosine, phenylalanine and tryptophan increase the probability of cleavage. Pepsin's proenzyme, pepsinogen, is released by the chief cells in the stomach wall, and upon mixing with the hydrochloric acid of the gastric juice, pepsinogen activates to become pepsin.  History  Pepsin was one of the first enzymes to be discovered in 1836 by Theodor Schwann. Schwann coined its name from the Greek word pepsis, meaning \\"digestion\\" (from peptein \\"to digest\\")., . Scientists around this time began discovering many biochemical compounds that play a significant role in biological processes, and pepsin was one of them. An acidic substance that was able to convert nitrogen-based foods into water-soluble material was determined to be pepsin. In 1928, it became one of the first enzymes to be crystallized when John H. Northrop crystallized it using dialysis, filtration, and cooling.  Precursor  Pepsin is expressed as a zymogen called pepsinogen, whose primary structure has an additional 44 amino acids compared to the active enzyme. In the stomach, chief cells release pepsinogen. This zymogen is activated by hydrochloric acid (HCl), which is released from parietal cells in the stomach lining. The hormone gastrin and the vagus nerve trigger the release of both pepsinogen and HCl from the stomach lining when food is ingested. Hydrochloric acid creates an acidic environment, which allows pepsinogen to unfold and cleave itself in an autocatalytic fashion, thereby generating pepsin (the active form). Pepsin cleaves the 44 amino acids from pepsinogen to create more pepsin. Pepsinogens are mainly grouped in 5 different groups based on their primary structure: pepsinogen A (also called pepsinogen I), pepsinogen B, progastricsin (also called pepsinogen II and pepsinogen C), prochymosin (also called prorennin) and pepsinogen F (also called pregnancy-associated glycoprotein).  Activity and stability  Pepsin is most active in acidic environments between pH 1.5 to 2.5. The optimum temperature of pepsin is between 37 ¬∞C and 42 ¬∞C. Accordingly, its primary site of synthesis and activity is in the stomach (pH 1.5 to 2). In humans the concentration of pepsin in the stomach reaches 0.5 ‚Äì 1 mg/mL. Pepsin is inactive at pH 6.5 and above, however pepsin is not fully denatured or irreversibly inactivated until pH 8.0. Therefore, pepsin in solutions of up to pH 8.0 can be reactivated upon re-acidification. The stability of pepsin at high pH has significant implications on disease attributed to laryngopharyngeal reflux. Pepsin remains in the larynx following a gastric reflux event. At the mean pH of the laryngopharynx (pH = 6.8) pepsin would be inactive but could be reactivated upon subsequent acid reflux events resulting in damage to local tissues. Pepsin exhibits a broad cleavage specificity. Pepsin will digest up to 20% of ingested amide bonds . Residues in the P1 and P1' positions are most important in determining cleavage probability. Generally, hydrophobic amino acids at P1 and P1' positions increase cleavage probability. Phenylalanine, leucine and methionine at the P1 position, and phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine at the P1' position result in the highest cleavage probability. Cleavage is disfavoured by positively charged amino acids histidine, lysine and arginine at the P1 position. Pepsin cleaves Phe1Val, Gln4His, Glu13Ala, Ala14Leu, Leu15Tyr, Tyr16Leu, Gly23Phe, Phe24 in the insulin B chain.  In laryngopharyngeal reflux  Pepsin is one of the primary causes of mucosal damage during laryngopharyngeal reflux. Pepsin remains in the larynx (pH 6.8) following a gastric reflux event. While enzymatically inactive in this environment, pepsin would remain stable and could be reactivated upon subsequent acid reflux events. Exposure of laryngeal mucosa to enzymatically active pepsin, but not irreversibly inactivated pepsin or acid, results in reduced expression of protective proteins and thereby increases laryngeal susceptibility to damage. Pepsin may also cause mucosal damage during weakly acidic or non-acid gastric reflux. Weak or non-acid reflux is correlated with reflux symptoms and mucosal injury. Under non-acid conditions (neutral pH), pepsin is internalized by cells of the upper airways such as the larynx and hypopharynx by a process known as receptor-mediated endocytosis. The receptor by which pepsin is endocytosed is currently unknown. Upon cellular uptake, pepsin is stored in intracellular vesicles of low pH at which its enzymatic activity would be restored. Pepsin is retained within the cell for up to 24 hours. Such exposure to pepsin at neutral pH and endocyctosis of pepsin causes changes in gene expression associated with inflammation, which underlies signs and symptoms of reflux, and tumor progression. This and other research implicates pepsin in carcinogenesis attributed to gastric reflux. Pepsin in airway specimens is considered to be a sensitive and specific marker for laryngopharyngeal reflux. Research to develop new pepsin-targeted therapeutic and diagnostic tools for gastric reflux is ongoing. A rapid non-invasive pepsin diagnostic called Peptest is now available which determines the presence of pepsin in saliva samples.  Storage  Pepsins should be stored at very low temperatures (between ‚àí80 ¬∞C and ‚àí20 ¬∞C) to prevent autolysis (self-digestion).  Inhibitors  Pepsin may be inhibited by high pH (see Activity and stability) or by inhibitor compounds. Pepstatin is a low molecular weight compound and potent inhibitor specific for acid proteases with a Ki of about 10‚àí10 M for pepsin. The statyl residue of pepstatin is thought to be responsible for pepstatin inhibition of pepsin; statine is a potential analog of the transition state for catalysis by pepsin and other acid proteases. Pepstatin does not covalently bind pepsin and inhibition of pepsin by pepstatin is therefore reversible. 1-bis(diazoacetyl)-2-phenylethane reversibly inactivates pepsin at pH 5, a reaction which is accelerated by the presence of Cu(II). Porcine pepsin is inhibited by pepsin inhibitor-3 (PI-3) produced by the large roundworm of pig (Ascaris suum). PI-3 occupies the active site of pepsin using its N-terminal residues and thereby blocks substrate binding. Amino acid residues 1 - 3 (Gln-Phe-Leu) of mature PI-3 bind to P1' - P3' positions of pepsin. The N-terminus of PI-3 in the PI-3:pepsin complex is positioned by hydrogen bonds which form an eight-stranded Œ≤-sheet, where three strands are contributed by pepsin and five by PI-3. Pepsin also undergoes feedback inhibition; a product of protein digestion slows down the reaction by inhibiting pepsin. Sucralfate also inhibits pepsin activity.  Applications  Beeman's Pepsin Gum Adams Pepsin Tutti Frutti Gum, marketed \\"For relief of indigestion and dyspepsia\\" Commercial pepsin is extracted from the glandular layer of hog stomachs. It is a component of rennet used to curdle milk during the manufacture of cheese. Pepsin is used for a variety of applications in food manufacturing: to modify and provide whipping qualities to soy protein and gelatin, to modify vegetable proteins for use in nondairy snack items, to make precooked cereals into instant hot cereals, and to prepare animal and vegetable protein hydrolysates for use in flavoring foods and beverages. It is used in the leather industry to remove hair and residual tissue from hides and in the recovery of silver from discarded photographic films by digesting the gelatin layer that holds the silver. Pepsin was historically an additive of Beeman's gum brand chewing gum by Dr. Edward E. Beeman. Pepsin is commonly used in the preparation of F(ab')2 fragments from antibodies. In some assays, it is preferable to use only the antigen-binding (Fab) portion of the antibody. For these applications, antibodies may be enzymatically digested to produce either an Fab or an F(ab')2 fragment of the antibody. To produce an F(ab')2 fragment, IgG is digested with pepsin, which cleaves the heavy chains near the hinge region. One or more of the disulfide bonds that join the heavy chains in the hinge region are preserved, so the two Fab regions of the antibody remain joined together, yielding a divalent molecule (containing two antibody binding sites), hence the designation F(ab')2. The light chains remain intact and attached to the heavy chain. The Fc fragment is digested into small peptides. Fab fragments are generated by cleavage of IgG with papain instead of pepsin. Papain cleaves IgG above the hinge region containing the disulfide bonds that join the heavy chains, but below the site of the disulfide bond between the light chain and heavy chain. This generates two separate monovalent (containing a single antibody binding site) Fab fragments and an intact Fc fragment. The fragments can be purified by gel filtration, ion exchange, or affinity chromatography. Fab and F(ab')2 antibody fragments are used in assay systems where the presence of the Fc region may cause problems. In tissues such as lymph nodes or spleen, or in peripheral blood preparations, cells with Fc receptors (macrophages, monocytes, B lymphocytes, and natural killer cells) are present which can bind the Fc region of intact antibodies, causing background staining in areas that do not contain the target antigen. Use of F(ab')2 or Fab fragments ensures that the antibodies are binding to the antigen and not Fc receptors. These fragments may also be desirable for staining cell preparations in the presence of plasma, because they are not able to bind complement, which could lyse the cells. F(ab')2, and to a greater extent Fab, fragments allow more exact localization of the target antigen, i.e., in staining tissue for electron microscopy. The divalency of the F(ab')2 fragment enables it to cross-link antigens, allowing use for precipitation assays, cellular aggregation via surface antigens, or rosetting assays.

Ureases are found in numerous bacteria, fungi, algae, plants, and some invertebrates, as well as in soils, as a soil enzyme. They are nickel-containing metalloenzymes of high molecular weight. These enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of urea into carbon dioxide and ammonia: : (NH2)2CO + H2O ‚Üí CO2 \\\\+ 2NH3 The hydrolysis of urea occurs in two stages. In the first stage, ammonia and carbamate are produced. The carbamate spontaneously and rapidly hydrolyzes to ammonia and carbonic acid. Urease activity increases the pH of its environment as ammonia is produced, which is basic.  History  Its activity was first identified in 1876 by Fr√©d√©ric Alphonse Musculus as a soluble ferment.Musculus, ¬´ Sur le ferment de l'ur√©e ¬ª, Comptes rendus de l'Acad√©mie des sciences, vol. 82, 1876, pp. 333-336, reachable in Gallica In 1926, James B. Sumner, showed that urease is a protein by examining its crystallized form. Sumner's work was the first demonstration that a protein can function as an enzyme and led eventually to the recognition that most enzymes are in fact proteins. Urease was the first enzyme crystallized. For this work, Sumner was awarded the Nobel prize in chemistry in 1946.The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1946 The crystal structure of urease was first solved by P. A. Karplus in 1995. Structure A 1984 study focusing on urease from jack bean found that the active site contains a pair of nickel centers. In vitro activation also has been achieved with manganese and cobalt in place of nickel. Lead salts are inhibiting. The molecular weight is either 480 kDa or 545 kDa for jack-bean urease (calculated mass from the amino acid sequence). 840 amino acids per molecule, of which 90 are cysteine residues. The optimum pH is 7.4 and optimum temperature is 60 ¬∞C. Substrates include urea and hydroxyurea. Bacterial ureases are composed of three distinct subunits, one large (Œ± 60‚Äì76kDa) and two small (Œ≤ 8‚Äì21 kDa, Œ≥ 6‚Äì14 kDa) commonly forming (Œ±Œ≤Œ≥)3 trimers stoichiometry with a 2-fold symmetric structure (note that the image above gives the structure of the asymmetric unit, one-third of the true biological assembly), they are cysteine-rich enzymes, resulting in the enzyme molar masses between 190 and 300kDa. An exceptional urease is obtained from Helicobacter sp.. These are composed of two subunits, Œ±(26‚Äì31 kDa)-Œ≤(61‚Äì66 kDa). These subunits form a supramolecular dodecameric complex. of repeating Œ±-Œ≤ subunits, each coupled pair of subunits has an active site, for a total of 12 active sites. (\\\\alpha_{12}\\\\beta_{12}). It plays an essential function for survival, neutralizing gastric acid by allowing urea to enter into periplasm via a proton-gated urea channel. The presence of urease is used in the diagnosis of Helicobacter species. All bacterial ureases are solely cytoplasmic, except for those in Helicobacter pylori, which along with its cytoplasmic activity, has external activity with host cells. In contrast, all plant ureases are cytoplasmic. Fungal and plant ureases are made up of identical subunits (~90 kDa each), most commonly assembled as trimers and hexamers. For example, jack bean urease has two structural and one catalytic subunit. The Œ± subunit contains the active site, it is composed of 840 amino acids per molecule (90 cysteines), its molecular mass without Ni(II) ions amounting to 90.77 kDa. The mass of the hexamer with the 12 nickel ions is 545.34 kDa. It is structurally related to the (Œ±Œ≤Œ≥)3 trimer of bacterial ureases. Other examples of homohexameric structures of plant ureases are those of soybean, pigeon pea and cotton seeds enzymes. It is important to note, that although composed of different types of subunits, ureases from different sources extending from bacteria to plants and fungi exhibit high homology of amino acid sequences. Activity The kcat/Km of urease in the processing of urea is 1014 times greater than the rate of the uncatalyzed elimination reaction of urea. There are many reasons for this observation in nature. The proximity of urea to active groups in the active site along with the correct orientation of urea allow hydrolysis to occur rapidly. Urea alone is very stable due to the resonance forms it can adopt. The stability of urea is understood to be due to its resonance energy, which has been estimated at 30‚Äì40 kcal/mol. This is because the zwitterionic resonance forms all donate electrons to the carbonyl carbon making it less of an electrophile making it less reactive to nucleophilic attack. =Active site= The active site of ureases is located in the Œ± (alpha) subunits. It is a bis-Œº-hydroxo dimeric nickel center, with an interatomic distance of ~3.5 √Ö. > The Ni(II) pair are weakly antiferromagnetically coupled. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) studies of Canavalia ensiformis (jack bean), Klebsiella aerogenes and Sporosarcina pasteurii (formerly known as Bacillus pasteurii) confirm 5‚Äì6 coordinate nickel ions with exclusively O/N ligation, including two imidazole ligands per nickel. Urea substrate is proposed to displace aquo ligands. Water molecules located towards the opening of the active site form a tetrahedral cluster that fills the cavity site through hydrogen bonds. Some amino acid residues are proposed to form mobile flap of the site, which gate for the substrate. Cysteine residues are common in the flap region of the enzymes, which have been determined not to be essential in catalysis, although involved in positioning other key residues in the active site appropriately. In Sporosarcina pasteurii urease, the flap was found in the open conformation, while its closed conformation is apparently needed for the reaction. When compared, the Œ± subunits of Helicobacter pylori urease and other bacterial ureases align with the jack bean ureases. The binding of urea to the active site of urease has not been observed. =Proposed mechanisms=Blakeley/Zerner One mechanism for the catalysis of this reaction by urease was proposed by Blakely and Zerner. It begins with a nucleophilic attack by the carbonyl oxygen of the urea molecule onto the 5-coordinate Ni (Ni-1). A weakly coordinated water ligand is displaced in its place. A lone pair of electrons from one of the nitrogen atoms on the Urea molecule creates a double bond with the central carbon, and the resulting NH2‚àí of the coordinated substrate interacts with a nearby positively charged group. Blakeley and Zerner proposed this nearby group to be a Carboxylate ion, although deprotonated carboxylates are negatively charged. A hydroxide ligand on the six coordinate Ni is deprotonated by a base. The carbonyl carbon is subsequently attacked by the electronegative oxygen. A pair of electrons from the nitrogen-carbon double bond returns to the nitrogen and neutralizes the charge on it, while the now 4-coordinate carbon assumes an intermediate tetrahedral orientation. The breakdown of this intermediate is then helped by a sulfhydryl group of a cysteine located near the active site. A hydrogen bonds to one of the nitrogen atoms, breaking its bond with carbon, and releasing an NH3 molecule. Simultaneously, the bond between the oxygen and the 6-coordinate nickel is broken. This leaves a carbamate ion coordinated to the 5-coordinate Ni, which is then displaced by a water molecule, regenerating the enzyme. The carbamate produced then spontaneously degrades to produce another ammonia and carbonic acid. Hausinger/Karplus The mechanism proposed by Hausinger and Karplus attempts to revise some of the issues apparent in the Blakely and Zerner pathway, and focuses on the positions of the side chains making up the urea-binding pocket. From the crystal structures from K. aerogenes urease, it was argued that the general base used in the Blakely mechanism, His320, was too far away from the Ni2-bound water to deprotonate in order to form the attacking hydroxide moiety. In addition, the general acidic ligand required to protonate the urea nitrogen was not identified. Hausinger and Karplus suggests a reverse protonation scheme, where a protonated form of the His320 ligand plays the role of the general acid and the Ni2-bound water is already in the deprotonated state. The mechanism follows the same path, with the general base omitted (as there is no more need for it) and His320 donating its proton to form the ammonia molecule, which is then released from the enzyme. While the majority of the His320 ligands and bound water will not be in their active forms (protonated and deprotonated, respectively,) it was calculated that approximately 0.3% of total urease enzyme would be active at any one time. While logically, this would imply that the enzyme is not very efficient, contrary to established knowledge, usage of the reverse protonation scheme provides an advantage in increased reactivity for the active form, balancing out the disadvantage. Placing the His320 ligand as an essential component in the mechanism also takes into account the mobile flap region of the enzyme. As this histidine ligand is part of the mobile flap, binding of the urea substrate for catalysis closes this flap over the active site and with the addition of the hydrogen bonding pattern to urea from other ligands in the pocket, speaks to the selectivity of the urease enzyme for urea. Ciurli/Mangani The mechanism proposed by Ciurli and Mangani is one of the more recent and currently accepted views of the mechanism of urease and is based primarily on the different roles of the two nickel ions in the active site. One of which binds and activates urea, the other nickel ion binds and activates the nucleophilic water molecule. With regards to this proposal, urea enters the active site cavity when the mobile ‚Äòflap‚Äô (which allows for the entrance of urea into the active site) is open. Stability of the binding of urea to the active site is achieved via a hydrogen-bonding network, orienting the substrate into the catalytic cavity. Urea binds to the five-coordinated nickel (Ni1) with the carbonyl oxygen atom. It approaches the six-coordinated nickel (Ni2) with one of its amino groups and subsequently bridges the two nickel centers. The binding of the urea carbonyl oxygen atom to Ni1 is stabilized through the protonation state of HisŒ±222 N‘ë. Additionally, the conformational change from the open to closed state of the mobile flap generates a rearrangement of AlaŒ±222 carbonyl group in such a way that its oxygen atom points to Ni2. The AlaŒ±170 and AlaŒ±366 are now oriented in a way that their carbonyl groups act as hydrogen-bond acceptors towards NH2 group of urea, thus aiding its binding to Ni2. Urea is a very poor chelating ligand due to low Lewis base character of its NH2 groups. However the carbonyl oxygens of AlaŒ±170 and AlaŒ±366 enhance the basicity of the NH2 groups and allow for binding to Ni2. Therefore, in this proposed mechanism, the positioning of urea in the active site is induced by the structural features of the active site residues which are positioned to act as hydrogen-bond donors in the vicinity of Ni1 and as acceptors in the vicinity of Ni2. The main structural difference between the Ciurli/Mangani mechanism and the other two is that it incorporates a nitrogen, oxygen bridging urea that is attacked by a bridging hydroxide. =Action in pathogenesis= Bacterial ureases are often the mode of pathogenesis for many medical conditions. They are associated with hepatic encephalopathy / Hepatic coma, infection stones, and peptic ulceration. Infection stones Infection induced urinary stones are a mixture of struvite (MgNH4PO4‚Ä¢6H2O) and carbonate apatite [Ca10(PO4)6‚Ä¢CO3]. These polyvalent ions are soluble but become insoluble when ammonia is produced from microbial urease during urea hydrolysis, as this increases the surrounding environments pH from roughly 6.5 to 9. The resultant alkalinization results in stone crystallization. In humans the microbial urease, Proteus mirabilis, is the most common in infection induced urinary stones. Urease in hepatic encephalopathy / hepatic coma Studies have shown that Helicobacter pylori along with cirrhosis of the liver cause hepatic encephalopathy and hepatic coma. Helicobacter pylori are microbial ureases found in the stomach. As ureases they hydrolyze urea to produce ammonia and carbonic acid. As the bacteria are localized to the stomach ammonia produced is readily taken up by the circulatory system from the gastric lumen. This results in elevated ammonia levels in the blood and is coined as hyperammonemia, eradication of Heliobacter pylori show marked decreases in ammonia levels. Urease in peptic ulcers Helicobacter pylori is also the cause of peptic ulcers with its manifestation in 55‚Äì68% reported cases. This was confirmed by decreased ulcer bleeding and ulcer reoccurrence after eradication of the pathogen. In the stomach there is an increase in pH of the mucosal lining as a result of urea hydrolysis, which prevents movement of hydrogen ions between gastric glands and gastric lumen. In addition, the high ammonia concentrations have an effect on intercellular tight junctions increasing permeability and also disrupting the gastric mucous membrane of the stomach. Occurrence and potential applications Urea is found naturally in the environment and is also artificially introduced, comprising more than half of all synthetic nitrogen fertilizers used globally. Heavy use of urea is thought to promote eutrophication, despite the observation that urea is rapidly transformed by microbial ureases, and thus usually does not persist. Environmental urease activity is often measured as an indicator of the health of microbial communities. In the absence of plants, urease activity in soil is generally attributed to heterotrophic microorganisms, although it has been demonstrated that some chemoautotrophic ammonium oxidizing bacteria are capable of growth on urea as a sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy.Marsh, K. L., G. K. Sims, and R. L. Mulvaney. 2005. Availability of urea to autotrophic ammonia- oxidizing bacteria as related to the fate of 14C- and 15N-labeled urea added to soil. Biol. Fert. Soil. 42:137-145. By promoting the formation of calcium carbonate, ureases are potentially useful for biomineralization-inspired processes. Notably, micro-biologically induced formation of calcium carbonate can be used in making bioconcrete.  As diagnostic test  Many gastrointestinal or urinary tract pathogens produce urease, enabling the detection of urease to be used as a diagnostic to detect presence of pathogens. Urease-positive pathogens include: *Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris *Ureaplasma urealyticum, a relative of Mycoplasma spp. *Nocardia *Corynebacterium urealyticum *Cryptococcus spp., an opportunistic fungus *Helicobacter pylori *Certain Enteric bacteria including Proteus spp., Klebsiella spp., Morganella, Providencia, and possibly Serratia spp. *Brucella * Staphylococcus saprophyticus * Staphylococcus aureusZhou C, Bhinderwala F, Lehman MK, Thomas VC, Chaudhari SS, et al.

Depending on the country and administrative divisions within the country, voters might consist of the general public in what is called an open primary, or solely the members of a political party in what is called a closed primary. In addition to these, there are other variants on primaries (which are discussed below) that are used by many countries holding elections throughout the world. The origins of primary elections can be traced to the progressive movement in the United States, which aimed to take the power of candidate nomination from party leaders to the people. However, political parties control the method of nomination of candidates for office in the name of the party. Other methods of selecting candidates include caucuses, conventions and nomination meetings. Types=General= Where primary elections are organized by parties, not the administration, two types of primaries can generally be distinguished: * Closed primary. (synonyms: internal primaries, party primaries) In the case of closed primaries, internal primaries, or party primaries, only party members can vote. * Open primary. All voters can take part in an open primary and may cast votes on a ballot of any party. The party may require them to express their support to the party's values and pay a small contribution to the costs of the primary. =United States= In the United States, other types can be differentiated: * Closed primary. People may vote in a party's primary only if they are registered members of that party prior to election day. Independents cannot participate. Note that because some political parties name themselves independent, the terms \\"non-partisan\\" or \\"unaffiliated\\" often replace \\"independent\\" when referring to those who are not affiliated with a political party. Thirteen states & Washington D.C., Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania, and Wyominghave closed primaries. * Semi-closed. As in closed primaries, registered party members can vote only in their own party's primary. Semi- closed systems, however, allow unaffiliated voters to participate as well. Depending on the state, independents either make their choice of party primary privately, inside the voting booth, or publicly, by registering with any party on Election Day. Fifteen statesAlaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, Utah, and West Virginiahave semi-closed primaries that allow voters to register or change party preference on election day. Massachusetts allows unenrolled voters or members of minor parties to vote in the primary of either major party, but registration or party changes must be done no fewer than 20 days prior to the primary. * Open primary. A registered voter may vote in any party primary regardless of his or her own party affiliation. Fourteen states - Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Hawaii, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, South Carolina, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin - have open primaries. When voters do not register with a party before the primary, it is called a pick-a-party primary because the voter can select which party's primary he or she wishes to vote in on election day. Because of the open nature of this system, a practice known as raiding may occur. Raiding consists of voters of one party crossing over and voting in the primary of another party, effectively allowing a party to help choose its opposition's candidate. The theory is that opposing party members vote for the weakest candidate of the opposite party in order to give their own party the advantage in the general election. An example of this can be seen in the 1998 Vermont senatorial primary with the nomination of Fred Tuttle as the Republican candidate in the general election . * Semi-open. A registered voter need not publicly declare which political party's primary that they will vote in before entering the voting booth. When voters identify themselves to the election officials, they must request a party's specific ballot. Only one ballot is cast by each voter. In many states with semi-open primaries, election officials or poll workers from their respective parties record each voter's choice of party and provide access to this information. The primary difference between a semi-open and open primary system is the use of a party-specific ballot. In a semi-open primary, a public declaration in front of the election judges is made and a party-specific ballot given to the voter to cast. Certain states that use the open-primary format may print a single ballot and the voter must choose on the ballot itself which political party's candidates they will select for a contested office. * Blanket primary. A primary in which the ballot is not restricted to candidates from one party. * Nonpartisan blanket primary. A primary in which the ballot is not restricted to candidates from one party, where the top two candidates advance to the general election regardless of party affiliation. Louisiana has famously operated under this system, which has been nicknamed the \\"jungle primary.\\" California has used a nonpartisan blanket primary since 2012 after passing Proposition 14 in 2010, and the State of Washington has used a nonpartisan blanket primary since 2008. Primaries in the United States The United States is one of a handful of countries to select candidates through popular vote in a primary election system;https://conversationswithbillkristol.org/transcript/murphy-transcript/ most other countries rely on party leaders or paid up party members to select candidates, as was previously the case in the U.S. In modern politics, primary elections have been described as a significant vehicle for taking decision- making from political insiders to the voters, though this is disputed by select political science research.Cohen, Marty. The Party Decides: Presidential Nominations before and after Reform. Chicago: University of Chicago, 2008. The selection of candidates for federal, state, and local general elections takes place in primary elections organized by the public administration for the general voting public to participate in for the purpose of nominating the respective parties' official candidates; state voters start the electoral process for governors and legislators through the primary process, as well as for many local officials from city councilors to county commissioners. The candidate who moves from the primary to be successful in the general election takes public office. =Non-partisan= Primaries can be used in nonpartisan elections to reduce the set of candidates that go on to the general election (qualifying primary). (In the U.S., many city, county and school board elections are non-partisan.) Generally, if a candidate receives more than 50% of the vote in the primary, he or she is automatically elected, without having to run again in the general election. If no candidate receives a majority, twice as many candidates pass the primary as can win in the general election, so a single seat election primary would allow the top two primary candidates to participate in the general election following. =Blanket= When a qualifying primary is applied to a partisan election, it becomes what is generally known as a blanket or Louisiana primary: typically, if no candidate wins a majority in the primary, the two candidates receiving the highest pluralities, regardless of party affiliation, go on to a general election that is in effect a run-off. This often has the effect of eliminating minor parties from the general election, and frequently the general election becomes a single-party election. Unlike a plurality voting system, a run-off system meets the Condorcet loser criterion in that the candidate that ultimately wins would not have been beaten in a two-way race with every one of the other candidates. Because many Washington residents were disappointed over the loss of their blanket primary, which the Washington State Grange helped institute in 1935, the Grange filed Initiative 872 in 2004 to establish a blanket primary for partisan races, thereby allowing voters to once again cross party lines in the primary election. The two candidates with the most votes then advance to the general election, regardless of their party affiliation. Supporters claimed it would bring back voter choice; opponents said it would exclude third parties and independents from general election ballots, could result in Democratic or Republican-only races in certain districts, and would in fact reduce voter choice. The initiative was put to a public vote in November 2004 and passed. On 15 July 2005, the initiative was found unconstitutional by the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. The U.S. Supreme Court heard the Grange's appeal of the case in October 2007. In March 2009, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Grange-sponsored Top 2 primary, citing a lack of compelling evidence to overturn the voter-approved initiative. In elections using electoral systems where strategic nomination is a concern, primaries can be very important in preventing \\"clone\\" candidates that split their constituency's vote because of their similarities. Primaries allow political parties to select and unite behind one candidate. However, tactical voting is sometimes a concern in non- partisan primaries as members of the opposite party can vote for the weaker candidate in order to face an easier general election. In California, under Proposition 14 (Top Two Candidates Open Primary Act), a voter-approved referendum, in all races except for that for U.S. president and county central committee offices, all candidates running in a primary election regardless of party will appear on a single primary election ballot and voters may vote for any candidate, with the top two vote-getters overall moving on to the general election regardless of party. The effect of this is that it will be possible for two Republicans or two Democrats to compete against each other in a general election if those candidates receive the most primary-election support.California Secretary of State =Partisan= As a result of a federal court decision in Idaho,Republican Party v. Ysursa the 2011 Idaho Legislature passed House Bill 351 implementing a closed primary system. Oregon was the first American state in which a binding primary election was conducted entirely via the internet. The election was held by the Independent Party of Oregon in July, 2010. =Presidential primaries= In the United States, Iowa and New Hampshire have drawn attention every four years because they hold the first caucus and primary election, respectively, and often give a candidate the momentum to win their party's nomination. A criticism of the current presidential primary election schedule is that it gives undue weight to the few states with early primaries, as those states often build momentum for leading candidates and rule out trailing candidates long before the rest of the country has even had a chance to weigh in, leaving the last states with virtually no actual input on the process. The counterargument to this criticism, however, is that, by subjecting candidates to the scrutiny of a few early states, the parties can weed out candidates who are unfit for office. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) proposed a new schedule and a new rule set for the 2008 Presidential primary elections. Among the changes: the primary election cycle would start nearly a year earlier than in previous cycles, states from the West and the South would be included in the earlier part of the schedule, and candidates who run in primary elections not held in accordance with the DNC's proposed schedule (as the DNC does not have any direct control over each state's official election schedules) would be penalized by being stripped of delegates won in offending states. The New York Times called the move, \\"the biggest shift in the way Democrats have nominated their presidential candidates in 30 years.\\" Of note regarding the DNC's proposed 2008 Presidential primary election schedule is that it contrasted with the Republican National Committee's (RNC) rules regarding presidential primary elections. \\"No presidential primary, caucus, convention, or other meeting may be held for the purpose of voting for a presidential candidate and/or selecting delegates or alternate delegates to the national convention, prior to the first Tuesday of February in the year in which the national convention is held.\\" In , this date is February . Candidates for U.S. President who seek their party's nomination participate in primary elections run by state governments, or caucuses run by the political parties. Unlike an election where the only participation is casting a ballot, a caucus is a gathering or \\"meeting of party members designed to select candidates and propose policies\\". Both primaries and caucuses are used in the presidential nomination process, beginning in January or February and culminating in the late summer political party conventions. Candidates may earn convention delegates from each state primary or caucus. Sitting presidents generally do not face serious competition from their party. =Primary classifications= While it is clear that the closed/semi-closed/semi-open/open classification commonly used by scholars studying primary systems does not fully explain the highly nuanced differences seen from state to state, still, it is very useful and has real-world implications for the electorate, election officials, and the candidates themselves. As far as the electorate is concerned, the extent of participation allowed to weak partisans and independents depends almost solely on which of the aforementioned categories best describes their state's primary system. Clearly, open and semi-open systems favor this type of voter, since they can choose which primary they vote in on a yearly basis under these models. In closed primary systems, true independents are, for all practical purposes, shut out of the process. This classification further affects the relationship between primary elections and election commissioners and officials. The more open the system, the greater the chance of raiding, or voters voting in the other party's primary in hopes of getting a weaker opponent chosen to run against a strong candidate in the general election. Raiding has proven stressful to the relationships between political parties, who feel cheated by the system, and election officials, who try to make the system run as smoothly as possible. Perhaps the most dramatic effect this classification system has on the primary process is its influence on the candidates themselves. Whether a system is open or closed dictates the way candidates run their campaigns. In a closed system, from the time a candidate qualifies to the day of the primary, he tends to have to cater to partisans, who tend to lean to the more extreme ends of the ideological spectrum. In the general election, under the assumptions of the median voter theorem, the candidate must move more towards the center in hopes of capturing a plurality.  Primaries in Europe  In Europe, primaries are not organized by the public administration but by parties themselves. Legislation is mostly silent on primaries. The main reason to this is that the electoral system used to form governments, be it proportional representation or two-round systems, lessens the need for an open primary. Governments are not involved in the process; however, parties may need their cooperation, notably in the case of an open primary, e.g. to obtain the electoral roll, or to cover the territory with a sufficient number of polling stations. Whereas closed primaries are rather common within many European countries, few political parties in Europe already opted for open primaries. Parties generally organise primaries to nominate the party leader (leadership election). The underlying reason for that is that most European countries are parliamentary democracies. National governments are derived from the majority in the Parliament, which means that the head of the government is generally the leader of the winning party. France is one exception to this rule. Closed primaries happen in many European countries, while open primaries have so far only occurred in the socialist and social- democratic parties in Greece and Italy, whereas the France's Socialist Party organised the first open primary in France in October 2011. One of the more recent developments is organizing primaries on the European level. European parties that organized primaries so far were the European Green Party (EGP) and the Party of European Socialists (PES). =Italy= Primary election were introduced in Italy to establish the centre-left candidates for 2005 regional election. In that occasion the centre-left The Union coalition held open primaries in order to select candidates for President of Apulia and Calabria. A more politically significant primary was held on 16 October 2005, when The Union asked its voters to decide the candidate for Prime Minister in the 2006 general election: 4,300,000 voters showed up and Romano Prodi won hands down. Two years later, on 14 October 2007, voters of the Democratic Party were called to choose the party leader among a list of six, their representatives to the Constituent Assembly and the local leaders. The primary was a success, involving more than 3,500,000 people across Italy, and gave to the winner Walter Veltroni momentum in a difficult period for the government and the centre-left coalition. The centre-right (see House of Freedoms, The People of Freedom, centre-right coalition and Forza Italia) has never held a primary at the national level, but held some experiments at the very local level. =France= In France, elections follow a two-round system. In the first round, all candidates who have qualified (for example, by obtaining a minimal number of signatures of support from elected officials) are on the ballot. In practice, each candidate usually represents a political party, large or small. In the second round, held two weeks later, the top two candidates run against each other, with the candidates from losing parties usually endorsing one of the two finalists. The means by which the candidate of an established political party is selected has evolved. Until 2012, none of the six Presidents elected through direct election faced a competitive internal election. * The right didn't hold often primary elections to decide for their national candidates. ** In 2007, Nicolas Sarkozy, President of the UMP, organized an approval \\"primary\\" without any opponent. He won by 98% and made his candidacy speech thereafter. ** In 2016, The Republicans held, on 20 and 27 November, primaries to decide of their presidential candidate for 2017. * On the left however, the Socialist Party, which helped Fran√ßois Mitterrand gain the Presidency for 14 years, has been plagued by internal divisions since the latter departed from politics. Rather than forming a new party, which is the habit on the right-wing, the party started to elect its nominee internally. ** A first try in 1995: Lionel Jospin won the nomination three months before the election. He lost in the run-off to Jacques Chirac. Later in 2002, although the candidacy of then-PM Jospin was undisputed in his party, each of the five left-wing parties of the government he led sent a candidate, paving the way for all five to lose by the Spoiler effect. ** The idea made progress as the 2007 race approached, once the referendum on a European constitution was over. The latter showed strong ideological divisions within the left-wing spectrum, and the Socialist Party itself. This prevented the possibility of a primary spanning the whole left-wing, that would give its support to a presidential candidate. Given that no majority supported either a leader or a split, a registration campaign, enabling membership for only 20 euros, and a closed primary was organized, which S√©gol√®ne Royal won. She qualified to the national run-off that she lost to Nicolas Sarkozy. ** In 2011, the Socialist Party decided to organise the first ever open primary in France to pick the Socialist party and the Radical Party of the Left nominee for the 2012 presidential election. Inspired by the 2008 U.S. primaries, it was seen as a way to reinvigorate the party. The idea was first proposed by Terra Nova, an independent left-leaning think tank, in a 2008 report. It was also criticized for going against the nature of the regime. The open primary was not state-organized : the party took charge of all the electoral procedures, planning to set up 10,000 voting polls. All citizens on the electoral rolls, members of the Socialist party and the Radical Party of the Left, and members of the parties' youth organisation (MJS and JRG), including minors of 15 to 18 years old, were entitled to vote in exchange for one euro to cover the costs. More than 3 million people participated in this first open primary, which was considered a success, and former party leader Fran√ßois Hollande was designated the Socialist and Radical candidate for the 2012 presidential election. * Other parties organize membership primaries to choose their nominee, such as Europe Ecologie ‚Äì Les Verts (EE-LV) (2006, 2011, 2016), and the French Communist Party in 2011. * At the local level, membership primaries are the rule for Socialist Party's candidates, but these are usually not competitive. In order to tame potential feud in his party, and prepare the ground for a long campaign, Sarkozy pushed for a closed primary in 2006 to designate the UMP candidate for the 2008 election of the Mayor of Paris. Fran√ßoise de Panafieu was elected in a four-way race. However, she did not clinch the mayorship two years later. =Russia= The first primaries in the history of Russia were held in May 2000 in St. Petersburg, the local branches of the parties Yabloko and the Union of Right Forces, who before the Gubernatorial election offered citizens to choose a single candidate from the democratic opposition. In 2007, before the parliamentary elections, United Russia held primaries in several regions. However, its results were not sufficiently taken into account when nominating candidates from the party. For example, the congress of United Russia included in the regional party list in the Samara region not the winners of the primaries, but those who did not even participate in the primaries. In the same year 2007, A Just Russia held the primaries to determine the candidate for the Gubernatorial election in Altai Krai. Anyone could vote for them, for which special items were opened. However, in the future, A Just Russia did not begin to pursue the primaries. In 2011, United Russia, together with the All-Russian People's Front, held primaries for the nomination of candidates for the parlmentary election. This vote was called the \\"All-People's Primaries\\", but in fact it was not. Candidates for the primaries were selected by special committees. Not even all party members had the right to vote, but only about 200,000 specially selected electors. In addition, the results of voting on the primaries were in most cases ignored. Of the 80 lists of regional groups of candidates for the State Duma, nominated by the congress of United Russia, only 8 lists coincided with the lists of winners of the primaries. All the same, the event played a role in the elimination of candidates: there were cases when the current deputies of the State Duma, having seen that they did not enjoy the support of electors, withdrew their candidacies. In the future, United Russia has sometimes resorted to an \\"open\\" model of primaries, which allows voting to all interested voters. In 2014, in the primaries of the \\"United Russia\\" before the elections to the Moscow City Duma, any Muscovite could vote, and not only registered electors. In 2016, the primaries for the selection of candidates for parliamentary elections were held by four parties: United Russia, People's Freedom Party,–ü—Ä–µ–¥–≤–∞—Ä–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ –≥–æ–ª–æ—Å–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ ¬´–í–æ–ª–Ω–∞ –ü–µ—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω¬ª –ü–ê–†–ù–ê–° the Party of Growth and the Green Alliance. The most massive were the 22 May 2016 primaries of the United Russia, which could vote for every citizen who has an active electoral right. However, the primaries, as well as earlier, were not binding for the leadership of United Russia: a number of winners of the primaries were withdrawn by the leadership without any explanation of reasons, and in 18 single-seat constituencies the party did not nominate any candidates. A striking example was the Nizhny Tagil constituency, where the candidate from the United Russia was approved candidate, who took the 4th place in the primaries. Finally, a number of candidates were included in the party list on the proposal of the party leader Dmitry Medvedev from among those who did not even participate in the primaries. In 2017, the Party of Growth holds the primaries for the nomination of candidates for the presidential election. These are the first presidential primaries in the history of Russia. However, voting for candidates will take place via the Internet within three months, and, according to the spokesman of the party, the results of the primaries will not be mandatory for the nomination of the candidate and the party convention may nominate another candidate who does not even participate in the primaries, or even not nominate candidates and support President Vladimir Putin, if he decides to be re-elected. =United Kingdom= For the 2010 general election, the Conservative Party used open primaries to select two candidates for Member of Parliament. Further open primaries were used to select some Conservative candidates for the 2015 general election, and there are hopes other parties may nominate future candidates in this way. = Hungary = A two-round primary election was held in Budapest, Hungary in 2019 between four opposition parties, to select a single candidate to the 2019 Budapest mayoral election. A smaller primary was also held in the district of Ferencv√°ros. =Socialist parties= In autumn 2011, here was how the twenty- nine socialist, social-democratic, and labour parties member of the Party of European Socialists (PES) had designated their party leader. * Only three parties organised an open primary: France (PS), Greece (Œ†ŒëŒ£ŒüŒö), Italy (PD) * Closed primary happened in nine parties: Belgium (sp.a, PS), Cyprus (ŒïŒîŒïŒö), Denmark (SD), France (PS) until 2011, Ireland (LP), Netherlands (PvdA), Portugal (PS), Spain (PSOE), United Kingdom (Labour) The case of UK's Labour party leadership election is specific, as three electoral colleges, each accounting for one third of the votes, participate in this primary election: Labour members of Parliament and of the European Parliament, party members and members of affiliated organisations such as trade unions. * The designation of the party leader was made by the party's congress in the eighteen remaining parties: Austria (SP√ñ), Bulgaria (–ë–°–ü), Czech Republic (ƒåSSD), Estonia (SDE), Finland (SDP), Germany (SPD), Hungary (MSZP), Latvia (LSDSP), Lithuania (SDPL), Luxembourg (LSAP), Malta (LP), Poland (SLD, UP), Romania (PSD), Slovakia (SMER-SD), Slovenia (SD), Spain (PSOE), Sweden (SAP), United-Kingdom / Northern Ireland (SDLP) =European Union= With a view to the European elections, many European political parties consider organising a presidential primary. Indeed, the Lisbon treaty, which entered into force in December 2009, lays down that the outcome of elections to the European Parliament must be taken into account in selecting the President of the Commission; the Commission is in some respects the executive branch of the EU and so its president can be regarded as the EU prime minister. Parties are therefore encouraged to designate their candidates for Commission president ahead of the next election in 2014, in order to allow voters to vote with a full knowledge of the facts. Many movements are now asking for primaries to designate these candidates. * Already in April 2004, a former British conservative MEP, Tom Spencer, advocated for American-style primaries in the European People's Party: \\"A series of primary elections would be held at two-week intervals in February and March 2009. The primaries would start in the five smallest countries and continue every two weeks until the big five voted in late March. To avoid swamping by the parties from the big countries, one could divide the number of votes cast for each candidate in each country by that country's voting weight in the Council of Ministers. Candidates for the post of president would have to declare by 1 January 2009.\\" Article by Tom Spencer in European Voice American-style primaries would breathe life into European elections 22.04.2004 * In July 2013 European Green Party (EGP) announced that it would run a first ever European-wide open primary as the preparation for the European elections in 2014. It was to be open to all citizens of the EU over the age of 16 who \\"supported green values\\"http://europeangreens.eu/sites/europeangreens.eu/files/imce/EN_square_primary_infographic.jpg They elected two transnational candidates who were to be the face of the common campaign of the European green parties united in the EGP, and who also were their candidates for European Commission president. * Following the defeat of the Party of European Socialists during the European elections of June 2009, the PES Congress that took place in Prague in December 2009 made the decision that PES would designate its own candidate before the 2014 European elections. A Campaign for a PES primary Website of the Campaign for a PES primary was then launched by PES supporters in June 2010, and it managed to convince the PES Council meeting in Warsaw in December 2010 to set up Working Group \\"Candidate 2014\\" in charge of proposing a procedure and timetable for a \\"democratic\\" and \\"transparent\\" designation process \\"bringing on board all our parties and all levels within the parties\\". Resolution of the PES Council in Warsaw, A democratic and transparent process for designating the PES candidate for the European Commission Presidency , 2 December 2010 The European think-tank Notre Europe also evokes the idea that European political parties should designate their candidate for Vice-President/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs. This would lead European parties to have \\"presidential tickets\\" on the American model. Finally, the European Parliament envisaged to introduce a requirement for internal democracy in the regulation on the statute of European political parties. European parties would therefore have to involve individual members in the major decisions such as designating the presidential candidate. European Parliament press release, Constitutional Affairs Committee discusses pan- European political parties, 31 January 2011 Primaries in Canada As in Europe, nomination meetings and leadership elections (somewhat similar to primary elections) in Canada are not organized by the public administration but by parties themselves. Political parties participate in federal elections to the House of Commons, in legislative elections in all ten provinces, and in Yukon. (The legislatures and elections in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut are non-partisan.) =Local candidates= Typically, in the months before an anticipated general election, local riding associations of political parties in each electoral district will schedule and announce a Nomination Meeting (similar to a nominating caucus in the United States). Would-be candidates will then file nomination papers with the association, and usually will devote time to solicit existing party members, and to sign up new party members who will also support them at the nomination meeting. At the meeting, typically each candidate will speak, and then members in attendance will vote. The electoral system most often used is an exhaustive ballot system; if no candidate has over 50% of the votes, the candidate with the lowest number of votes will be dropped and another ballot will be held. Also, other candidates who recognize that they will probably not win may withdraw between ballots, and may \\"throw their support\\" to (encourage their own supporters to vote for) another candidate. After the nomination meeting, the candidate and the association will obtain approval from party headquarters, and file the candidate's official nomination papers and necessary fees and deposits with Elections Canada or the provincial/territorial election commissions as appropriate. At times, party headquarters may overturn an association's chosen candidate; for example, if any scandalous information about the candidate comes to light after the nomination. A party headquarters may also \\"parachute\\" a prominent candidate into an easy-to-win riding, removing the need to have a nomination meeting. These situations only come up infrequently, as they tend to cause disillusionment among a party's supporters. =Party leaders= Canadian political parties also organize their own elections of party leaders. Not only will the party leader run for a seat in their own chosen riding, they will also become Prime Minister (in a federal election) or Premier (in a province or territory) should their party win the most seats. Thus, a leadership election is also considered to be one for the party's de facto candidate for Prime Minister or Premier. If the party wins the second-most seats, the party leader will become Leader of the Official Opposition; if the party comes third or lower, the leader will still be recognized as the leader of their party, and will be responsible for co-ordinating the activities and affairs of their party's caucus in the legislature. In the past, Canadian political parties chose party leaders through an American-style delegated leadership convention. Local riding associations would choose delegates, usually in a manner similar to how they would choose a candidate for election. These delegates typically said explicitly which leadership candidate they would support. Those delegates, as well as other delegates (e.g. sitting party members of Parliament or the legislature, or delegates from party-affiliated organizations such as labor unions in the case of the New Democratic Party), would then vote, again using the exhaustive ballot method, until a leader was chosen. Some provincial political parties retain the delegated convention format. Lately, Canada's major political parties have moved to a \\"one member, one vote\\" system for their federal leadership elections. A leadership convention is still scheduled, but all party members have a chance to vote for the new leader. Typically, members may vote either in person at the convention, online, or through a mail-in ballot. Instant-runoff voting (IRV) is used in whole or in part to elect the leaders of the three largest federal political parties in Canada: the Liberal Party of Canada, the Conservative Party of Canada, and the New Democratic Party, albeit the New Democratic Party uses a mixture of IRV and exhaustive voting, allowing each member to choose one format or the other for their vote (as was used in their 2017 leadership election). In 2013, members of the Liberal Party of Canada elected Justin Trudeau as party leader through IRV in a national leadership election. The Conservative Party used IRV (where each of the party's 338 riding associations are weighted equally, regardless of how many members voted in each riding) to elect Erin O'Toole as party leader in 2020, and Stephen Harper in 2004.

Charles wrote almost nothing about mathematics, and most of what has been credited to him was due to mistaking him with another Jacques Charles, also a member of the Paris Academy of Sciences, entering on May 12, 1785. He was sometimes called Charles the Geometer. (See J. B. Gough, Charles the Obscure, Isis 70, #254, pgs 576-579) Charles and the Robert brothers launched the world's first unmanned hydrogen-filled gas balloon in August 1783; then in December 1783, Charles and his co-pilot Nicolas-Louis Robert ascended to a height of about 1,800 feet (550 m) in a manned gas balloon. Their pioneering use of hydrogen for lift led to this type of balloon being named a Charli√®re (as opposed to a Montgolfi√®re which used hot air). Charles's law, describing how gases tend to expand when heated, was formulated by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac in 1802, but he credited it to unpublished work by Jacques Charles. Charles was elected to the Acad√©mie des Sciences in 1795 and subsequently became professor of physics at the Acad√©mie de Sciences. Biography Charles was born in Beaugency-sur- Loire in 1746. He married Julie Fran√ßoise Bouchaud des H√©rettes (1784‚Äì1817), a creole woman 37 years younger than himself. Reportedly the poet Alphonse de Lamartine also fell in love with her, and she was the inspiration for Elvire in his 1820 autobiographical Poetic Meditation \\"Le Lac\\" (\\"The Lake\\"), which describes in retrospect the fervent love shared by a couple from the point of view of the bereaved man. Charles outlived her and died in Paris on April 7, 1823. Hydrogen balloon flights=First hydrogen balloon= The balloon built by Jacques Charles and the Robert brothers is attacked by terrified villagers in Gonesse. Some of them even started attacking him because they weren't used to things flying. Charles conceived the idea that hydrogen would be a suitable lifting agent for balloons having studied the work of Robert Boyle's Boyle's Law which was published 100 years earlier in 1662, and of his contemporaries Henry Cavendish, Joseph Black and Tiberius Cavallo. He designed the craft and then worked in conjunction with the Robert brothers, Anne-Jean and Nicolas-Louis, to build it in their workshop at the Place des Victoires in Paris. The brothers invented the methodology for the lightweight, airtight gas bag by dissolving rubber in a solution of turpentine and varnished the sheets of silk that were stitched together to make the main envelope. They used alternate strips of red and white silk, but the discolouration of the varnishing/rubberising process left a red and yellow result. Jacques Charles and the Robert brothers launched the world's first hydrogen filled balloon on August 27, 1783, from the Champ de Mars, (now the site of the Eiffel Tower) where Ben Franklin was among the crowd of onlookers. The balloon was comparatively small, a 35 cubic metre sphere of rubberised silk, and only capable of lifting about 9 kg (20 lb). It was filled with hydrogen that had been made by pouring nearly a quarter of a tonne of sulphuric acid onto a half a tonne of scrap iron. The hydrogen gas was fed into the balloon via lead pipes; but as it was not passed through cold water, great difficulty was experienced in filling the balloon completely (the gas was hot when produced, but as it cooled in the balloon, it contracted). Daily progress bulletins were issued on the inflation; and the crowd was so great that on the 26th the balloon was moved secretly by night to the Champ de Mars, a distance of 4 kilometres. The balloon flew northwards for 45 minutes, pursued by chasers on horseback, and landed 21 kilometers away in the village of Gonesse where the reportedly terrified local peasants destroyed it with pitchforks or knives. The project was funded by a subscription organised by Barthelemy Faujas de Saint-Fond. =First manned hydrogen balloon flight= First flight of a gas air balloon on December 1, 1783 Contemporary illustration of the first flight by Prof. Jacques Charles with Nicolas-Louis Robert, December 1, 1783. Viewed from the Place de la Concorde to the Tuileries Palace (destroyed in 1871) At 13:45 (or 1:45 PM) on December 1, 1783 Jacques Charles and the Robert brothers launched a new manned balloon from the Jardin des Tuileries in Paris. Jacques Charles was accompanied by Nicolas-Louis Robert as co-pilot of the 380-cubic- metre, hydrogen-filled balloon. The envelope was fitted with a hydrogen release valve and was covered with a net from which the basket was suspended. Sand ballast was used to control altitude. They ascended to a height of about 1,800 feet (550 m) and landed at sunset in Nesles-la-Vall√©e after a 2-hour 5 minute flight covering 36 km. The chasers on horseback, who were led by the Duc de Chartres, held down the craft while both Charles and Nicolas-Louis alighted. Jacques Charles then decided to ascend again, but alone this time because the balloon had lost some of its hydrogen. This time it ascended rapidly to an altitude of about 3,000 metres, where he saw the sun again. He began suffering from aching pain in his ears so he \\"valved\\" to release gas, and descended to land gently about 3 km away at . Unlike the Robert brothers, Charles never flew again, although a hydrogen balloon came to be called a Charli√®re in his honour. It is reported that 400,000 spectators witnessed the launch, and that hundreds had paid one crown each to help finance the construction and receive access to a \\"special enclosure\\" for a \\"close-up view\\" of the take-off. Among the \\"special enclosure\\" crowd was Benjamin Franklin, the diplomatic representative of the United States of America. Also present was Joseph Montgolfier, whom Charles honoured by asking him to release the small, bright green, pilot balloon to assess the wind and weather conditions. This event took place ten days after the world's first manned balloon flight by Jean-Fran√ßois Pil√¢tre de Rozier using a Montgolfier brothers hot air balloon. Simon Schama wrote in Citizens: Meusnier's dirigible =Further ballooning activities= The next project of Jacques Charles and the Robert brothers was to build an elongated, steerable craft that followed Jean Baptiste Meusnier's proposals (1783‚Äì85) for a dirigible balloon. The design incorporated Meusnier's internal ballonnet (air cells), a rudder and a method of propulsion. Jacques Charles chose never to fly in this craft, but on July 15, 1784 the brothers flew for 45 minutes from Saint-Cloud to Meudon with M. Collin-Hullin and Louis Philippe II, the Duke of Chartres in La Caroline. It was fitted with oars for propulsion and direction, but they proved useless. The absence of a 'gas release valve' meant that the duke had to slash the 'ballonnet' to prevent rupture when they reached an altitude of circa . On September 19, 1784 the Robert brothers and M. Collin-Hullin flew for 6 hours 40 minutes, covering 186 km from Paris to Beuvry near B√©thune. This was the first flight over 100 km. : Inventions Charles developed several useful inventions, including a valve to let hydrogen out of the balloon and other devices, such as the hydrometer and reflecting goniometer, and improved the Gravesand heliostat and Fahrenheit's aerometer. In addition he confirmed Benjamin Franklin's electrical experiments. Charles's law Charles's law (also known as the law of volumes), describing how gases tend to expand when heated, was first published by natural philosopher Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac in 1802, but he credited it to unpublished work by Jacques Charles, and named the law in his honour. Around 1787 Charles did an experiment where he filled 5 balloons to the same volume with different gases. He then raised the temperature of the balloons to 80 ¬∞C and noticed that they all increased in volume by the same amount. This experiment was referenced by Gay-Lussac in 1802 when he published a paper on the precise relationship between the volume and temperature of a gas. Charles' law states that under constant pressure, an ideal gas' volume is proportional to its absolute temperature. The volume of a gas at constant pressure increases linearly with the absolute temperature of the gas. The formula he created was V1/T1 = V2/T2. Career Jacques Charles was elected to the Acad√©mie des Sciences, in 1795, and subsequently became professor of physics at the Conservatoire des Arts et M√©tiers.

One of LilyPond's major goals is to produce scores that are engraved with traditional layout rules, reflecting the era when scores were engraved by hand. LilyPond is cross-platform, and is available for several common operating systems; released under the terms of the GNU General Public License, LilyPond is free software. The MediaWiki Score extension allows editors to embed Lilypond notation in Wikipedia articles, and renders them into PNG images, audio, and MIDI files. History The LilyPond project was started in 1996 by Han-Wen Nienhuys and Jan Nieuwenhuizen, after they decided to abandon work on MPP (MusiXTeX PreProcessor), a project they began collaborating on in 1995. Its name was inspired both by the Rosegarden project and an acquaintance of Nienhuys and Nieuwenhuizen named Suzanne, a name that means lily in Hebrew (◊©◊Å◊ï÷º◊©÷∏◊Å◊ü). = Version 1.0 = LilyPond 1.0 was released on July 31, 1998, highlighting the development of a custom music font, Feta, and the complete separation of LilyPond from MusiXTeX. = Version 2.0 = LilyPond 2.0 was released on September 24, 2003, announcing a simplified syntax model and a much more complete set of facilities for notating various styles of music. Design Screenshot of LilyPond running on Linux LilyPond is mostly written in C++ and uses Scheme (interpreted by GNU Guile) as its extension language, allowing for user customization. It has a relatively large codebase; as of March 10, 2017, the source includes over 600,000 lines of C++, 140,000 lines of Scheme, and 120,000 lines of Python code. It uses a simple text notation for music input, which LilyPond interprets and processes in a series of stages. In the final stage, music notation is output to PDF (via PostScript) or other graphical formats, such as SVG or PNG. LilyPond can also generate MIDI files that correspond to the music notation output. LilyPond is a text- based application, so it does not contain its own graphical user interface to assist with score creation. (However, a text-editor based \\"LilyPad\\" GUI for Windows and MacOS is included by default on these systems.) It does, however, have a flexible input language that strives to be simple, easing the learning curve for new users. LilyPond adheres to the WYSIWYM paradigm; the workflow for typesetting music notation with LilyPond is similar to that of preparing documents with LaTeX. LilyPond supports experimental musical notation. Its guitar facilities support alternative tunings, such as major-thirds tuning. Software features Beethoven's Symphony No. 5 music sheet printed from a digitally engraved PDF file produced by LilyPond; released by the Mutopia Project LilyPond's primary goal is to produce output comparable to professionally engraved scores instead of output that looks mechanical and computer-generated. An essay from the LilyPond website, written by LilyPond developers, explains some typographical issues addressed by LilyPond: * Optical font scaling: depending on the staff size, the design of the music font is slightly altered; this is a feature that Donald Knuth's Computer Modern font is known for. As a result, note heads become more rounded, and staff lines become thicker. * Optical spacing: stem directions are taken into account when spacing subsequent notes. * Special ledger line handling: ledger lines are shortened when accidentals are nearby, thus enhancing readability. * Proportional spacing: notes can be positioned in such a way that exactly reflects their duration. For example, with this setting, the space between consecutive quarter notes is four times greater than between consecutive sixteenth notes. Overview of input syntax The native input language for LilyPond is comprehensive, and consists of many commands needed for expressing any sort of articulation, dynamic, meter, etc. It is similar to that of TeX. The ability to embed Scheme code within a LilyPond source file permits arbitrary extensions to the input language and assists with algorithmic composition. Some general syntactic features are listed below. * Single-line comments begin with a percent sign \`%\`. * Notes are represented in pitch- duration format: pitch is specified with Helmholtz pitch notation, and duration is specified with a numeral based system. The semantics of the pitch- duration format change depending on the active input mode; this is explained in depth in the LilyPond manual. For example, in absolute mode, \`a'4\` is an A, one octave up from the base A (A3 in scientific pitch notation), of quarter note length. * Commands usually begin with a backslash (such as \`\\\\time\`, or \`\\\\slurUp\`). The function of the command in question determines where the command is placed; for example, if the command is used to indicate a fixed dynamic on a specific note, it is placed after the note. * Some common commands are represented symbolically to ease typing. One example is with slurs, where \`(\` and \`)\` indicate the beginning and ending of a slur, respectively. Another example is with manual beaming, where \`[\` and \`]\` indicate the extent of the beam. LilyPond's interface with Pango requires the input character encoding to be UTF-8. One benefit of this is that more than one language can be included in the same source file.

Several graphical scorewriters‚Äîsuch as Rosegarden, NoteEdit, Canorus, Denemo, and TuxGuitar‚Äîcan export files directly to LilyPond format. Other graphical applications serve as front ends to LilyPond, including Frescobaldi and the LilyPondTool plugin for jEdit. Denemo integrates the PDF output of LilyPond in its display, allowing some editing operations on the final typeset score. The Mutopia Project, which distributes free content sheet music, uses LilyPond to typeset its music, as does Musipedia, a collaborative music encyclopedia. Emacs' org- mode contains support for embedding LilyPond scores into documents. OOoLilyPond, a LibreOffice extension provides support for calling LilyPond to embed scores into documents. = Integration into MediaWiki = Lilypond is available in MediaWiki via the code. This, for example, transforms the notation \\\\relative c' { f d f a d f e d cis a cis e a g f e } into \\\\relative c' { f d f a d f e d cis a cis e a g f e } The above excerpt is a simplified version of Solfeggio in C Minor by C.P.E. Bach. More complex scores, including lyrics, are also possible within MediaWikis. =Integration into text using lilypond-book= Integration of lilypond musical elements into various document formats (both TeX-based systems such as LaTeX and Texinfo, and also DocBook and HTML pages) is natively supported through the companion program lilypond-book, developed and maintained by the LilyPond community. This allows users to embed musical elements within texts, such as musicology, song booklets, work sheets for teaching, and school examinations. =Integration into LaTeX= For integration into the LaTeX document preparation system, lyLuaTeX has been developed as a LuaLaTeX package to embed musical elements within texts. It includes features for matching layout and appearance of the musical elements with the surrounding text document. Music elements may consist of music symbols, song lyrics, guitar chords diagrams, lead sheets, music excerpts, guitar tablatures, or multi-page scores. Comparison to other scorewriters Finale and Sibelius are two proprietary scorewriters often compared to LilyPond. Andrew Hawryluk, a LilyPond user, wrote a series of articles comparing output quality between Finale and LilyPond. Another scorewriter with comparable features to LilyPond is SCORE, but SCORE relies on manual positioning more than Lilypond does. See also Comparison of scorewriters.

It is used in gas-discharge lamps, such as neon lamps, discharge tubes, and some types of vacuum tube. The other type of cathode is a hot cathode, which is heated by electric current passing through a filament. A cold cathode does not necessarily operate at a low temperature: it is often heated to its operating temperature by other methods, such as the current passing from the cathode into the gas. Cold-cathode devices thumbupright The stacked digit arrangement in a Nixie tube is visible here A cold-cathode vacuum tube does not rely on external heating of an electrode to provide thermionic emission of electrons. Early cold-cathode devices included the Geissler tube and Plucker tube, and early cathode ray tubes. Study of the phenomena in these devices led to the discovery of the electron. Neon lamps are used both to produce light as indicators and for special-purpose illumination, and also as circuit elements displaying negative resistance. Addition of a trigger electrode to a device allowed the glow discharge to be initiated by an external control circuit; Bell Laboratories developed a \\"trigger tube\\" cold-cathode device in 1936.D. M. Neale, Cold Cathode Tube Circuit Design, Francis and Taylor, 1964. pp. 1‚Äì7. Many types of cold-cathode switching tube were developed, including various types of thyratron, the krytron, cold-cathode displays (Nixie tube) and others. Voltage regulator tubes rely on the relatively constant voltage of a glow discharge over a range of current and were used to stabilize power-supply voltages in tube-based instruments. A Dekatron is a cold-cathode tube with multiple electrodes that is used for counting. Each time a pulse is applied to a control electrode, a glow discharge moves to a step electrode; by providing ten electrodes in each tube and cascading the tubes, a counter system can be developed and the count observed by the position of the glow discharges. Counter tubes were used widely before development of integrated circuit counter devices. The flash tube is a cold-cathode device filled with xenon gas, used to produce an intense short pulse of light for photography or to act as a stroboscope to examine the motion of moving parts. =Lamps= Cold- cathode lamps include cold-cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFLs) and neon lamps. Neon lamps primarily rely on excitation of gas molecules to emit light; CCFLs use a discharge in mercury vapor to develop ultraviolet light, which in turn causes a fluorescent coating on the inside of the lamp to emit visible light. Cold-cathode fluorescent lamps were used for backlighting of LCDs, for example computer monitors and television screens. In the lighting industry, ‚Äúcold cathode‚Äù historically refers to luminous tubing larger than 20 mm in diameter and operating on a current of 120 to 240 milliamperes. This larger-diameter tubing is often used for interior alcove and general lighting. The term \\"neon lamp\\" refers to tubing that is smaller than 15 mm in diameter and typically operates at approximately 40 milliamperes. These lamps are commonly used for neon signs. Details The cathode is the negative electrode. Any gas- discharge lamp has a positive (anode) and a negative electrode. Both electrodes alternate between acting as an anode and a cathode when these devices run with alternating current. A standard computer case fitted with blue and green cold-cathode tubes Cold-cathode fluorescent lamp backlight A cold cathode is distinguished from a hot cathode that is heated to induce thermionic emission of electrons. Discharge tubes with hot cathodes have an envelope filled with low-pressure gas and containing two electrodes. Examples are most common fluorescent lamps, high-pressure discharge lamps and vacuum fluorescent displays. The surface of cold cathodes can emit secondary electrons at a ratio greater than unity (breakdown). An electron that leaves the cathode will collide with neutral gas molecules. The collision may just excite the molecule, but sometimes it will knock an electron free to create a positive ion. The original electron and the freed electron continue toward the anode and may create more positive ions (see Townsend avalanche). The result is for each electron that leaves the cathode, several positive ions are generated that eventually crash onto the cathode. Some crashing positive ions may generate a secondary electron. The discharge is self-sustaining when for each electron that leaves the cathode, enough positive ions hit the cathode to free, on average, another electron. External circuitry limits the discharge current. Cold-cathode discharge lamps use higher voltages than hot-cathode ones. The resulting strong electric field near the cathode accelerates ions to a sufficient velocity to create free electrons from the cathode material. Another mechanism to generate free electrons from a cold metallic surface is field electron emission. It is used in some x-ray tubes, the field-electron microscope (FEM), and field-emission displays (FEDs). Cold cathodes sometimes have a rare-earth coating to enhance electron emission. Some types contain a source of beta radiation to start ionization of the gas that fills the tube., Discharge tube. In some tubes, glow discharge around the cathode is usually minimized; instead there is a so-called positive column, filling the tube., Electron emissive electrode., Gaseous-conduction lamp.Positive column is part of a glow discharge, such as in the Moore lamp. Examples are the neon lamp and nixie tubes. Nixie tubes too are cold-cathode neon displays that are in-line, but not in-plane, display devices. Cold-cathode devices typically use a complex high-voltage power supply with some mechanism for limiting current. Although creating the initial space charge and the first arc of current through the tube may require a very high voltage, once the tube begins to heat up, the electrical resistance drops, thus increasing the electric current through the lamp. To offset this effect and maintain normal operation, the supply voltage is gradually lowered. In the case of tubes with an ionizing gas, the gas can become a very hot plasma, and electrical resistance is greatly reduced. If operated from a simple power supply without current limiting, this reduction in resistance would lead to damage to the power supply and overheating of the tube electrodes. Applications CFL Cold cathodes are used in cold-cathode rectifiers, such as the crossatron and mercury-arc valves, and cold-cathode amplifiers, such as in automatic message accounting and other pseudospark switching applications. Other examples include the thyratron, krytron, sprytron, and ignitron tubes. A common cold- cathode application is in neon signs and other locations where the ambient temperature is likely to drop well below freezing, The Clock Tower, Palace of Westminster (Big Ben) uses cold-cathode lighting behind the clock faces where continual striking and failure to strike in cold weather would be undesirable. Large cold-cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFLs) have been produced in the past and are still used today when shaped, long-life linear light sources are required. , miniature CCFLs were extensively used as backlights for computer and television liquid-crystal displays. CCFL lifespans vary in LCD televisions depending on transient voltage surges and temperature levels in usage environments. Due to its efficiency, CCFL technology has expanded into room lighting. Costs are similar to those of traditional fluorescent lighting, but with several advantages: the light emitted is , bulbs turn on instantly to full output and are also dimmable.Sol√© Lighting (commercial site advocating CCFLs). =Effects of internal heating= In systems using alternating current but without separate anode structures, the electrodes alternate as anodes and cathodes, and the impinging electrons can cause substantial localized heating, often to red heat. The electrode may take advantage of this heating to facilitate the thermionic emission of electrons when it is acting as a cathode. (Instant-start fluorescent lamps employ this aspect; they start as cold-cathode devices, but soon localized heating of the fine tungsten-wire cathodes causes them to operate in the same mode as hot-cathode lamps.) This aspect is problematic in the case of backlights used for LCD TV displays. New energy-efficiency regulations being proposed in many countries will require variable backlighting; variable backlightling also improves the perceived contrast range, which is desirable for LCD TV sets. However, CCFLs are strictly limited in the degree to which they can be dimmed, both because a lower plasma current will lower the temperature of the cathode, causing erratic operation, and because running the cathode at too low a temperature drastically shortens the life of the lamps. Much research is being directed to this problem, but high-end manufacturers are now turning to high-efficiency white LEDs as a better solution.

It was developed by Vickers- Armstrongs in response to Specification B.35/46 issued by the Air Ministry for a nuclear-armed jet-powered bomber. The Valiant was the first of the V bombers to become operational, and was followed by the Handley Page Victor and the Avro Vulcan. The Valiant was the only V bomber to have dropped live nuclear weapons (for test purposes).Blackman and Wright 2015, p. 33. In 1956, Valiants operating from Malta flew bombing missions over Egypt for Operation Musketeer during the Suez Crisis, using conventional high-explosive (HE) bombs. From 1956 until early 1966 the main Valiant force was used in the nuclear deterrence role in the confrontation between NATO and the Warsaw Pact powers. Some Valiant Squadrons had other roles including aerial refuelling (90 and 214 Squadrons at RAF Honington and RAF Marham)), aerial reconnaissance (543 Squadron at RAF Wyton), and Electronic Warfare (18 Squadron at RAF Finningley). In 1962, in response to advances in Soviet Union surface-to-air missile (SAM) technology, the V-force fleet including the Valiant changed from high level flying to flying at low-level to avoid SAM attacks that they would have received if they were flying at high altitudes. In 1964 it was found that Valiants, mainly of the bomber squadrons that were operating in the low-level role, showed fatigue and inter-crystalline corrosion in wing rear spar attachment forgings. This was traced to the use of aluminium alloy, DTD683.\\"Pitfalls of the substitution of sophistication for Common Sense\\" D Howe, Cranfield University. IMechE Vol 212 Part G, Sec 5.1 Metals, p. 307. May 1998 In late 1964 a repair programme was underway, but a change of Government led to the new Minister of Defence Denis Healey deciding that the Valiant should be retired from service, and this happened in early 1965. The Victor and Vulcan V-bombers remained in service until the 1980s. Development=Background and origins= In November 1944, the Joint Technical Warfare Committee, along with a separate committee chaired by Sir Henry Tizard, examined the future potential of \\"weapons of war\\" and the accompanying Tizard Report published on 3 July 1945 made specific policy directions for the Royal Air Force (RAF) Bomber Command.Turpin 2002, p. 71. After the Second World War, the policy of using heavy four-engined bombers for massed raids continued into the immediate postwar period; the Avro Lincoln, an updated version of the Avro Lancaster, became the RAF's standard bomber.McLelland 2013, p. 18. In 1946, the Air Staff issued Operational Requirements OR229 and OR230 for the development of turbojet-powered heavy bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons at high altitude and speed, without defensive armament, to act as a deterrent to hostile powers and, if deterrence failed, to perform a nuclear strike. In conjunction with this ambition, Britain set about developing its own atomic weapons. In January 1947, the British Air Ministry issued Specification B.35/46 for an advanced jet bomber intended to carry nuclear weapons and to fly near the speed of sound at altitudes of . Three firms: A.V. Roe, Handley-Page and Vickers-Armstrongs submitted advanced designs intended to meet the stringent requirements.Burnet and Morgan Aeroplane Monthly August 1980, p. 397. While Short Brothers submitted a design, by Geoffrey T. R. Hill, that was judged too ambitious, the Air Staff accepted another submission from the company for a separate requirement, B.14/46, as \\"insurance\\" in case the advanced B.35/46 effort ran into trouble. Aviation authors Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist described Specification B.14/46 as \\"calling for little more than a traditional aircraft fitted with jet engines\\"Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 72. Short submitted a conservative design to meet B.14/46, which became the S.A.4 Sperrin. Two prototypes were completed, the first conducting its maiden flight in 1951, but the Sperrin was ultimately relegated to research and development purposes only. Vickers had emerged from the Second World War as one of the world's pre-eminent companies in the field of aeronautical manufacturing and development. Furthermore, the company operated its own secretive Skunk Works-like development organisation based at Weybridge, Surrey, which had been involved in several secret wartime development projects. It was this secretive division in which the early stages of the development of the Valiant took place, including the later assembly of the initial two prototypes.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 72‚Äì73. Vickers initially produced a six-engine jet bomber design proposal to meet Specification B.35/46; as rapid progress in the development of more powerful jet engines had been made, this was re-worked to a four-engine proposal in 1948.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 73. The proposed design submitted by Vickers was relatively straightforward, being less aerodynamically advanced in comparison to competing bids made by rival firms.Blackman and Wright 2015, p. 17. Both Handley-Page and Avro had produced advanced designs for the bomber competition. These would be produced as the Victor and the Vulcan respectively; the Air Staff decided to award contracts to each company as a form of insurance in case one of these designs failed. The submissions became known as the V bombers, or V-class, with the aircraft all being given names that started with the letter \\"V\\".Downey 1985, p. 5. Vickers' submission had initially been rejected as not being as advanced as the Victor and the Vulcan,Rosemeyer 2009, p. 52. but Vickers' chief designer George Edwards lobbied the Air Ministry on the basis that it would be available much sooner than the competition, going so far as to promise that a flight-capable prototype would be flown by the end of 1951, that subsequent production aircraft would be flown prior to the end of 1953, and that serial deliveries would commence during early 1955. Gunston and Gilchrist observe that measures offered by Edwards were a \\"gigantic risk\\", and that gaining the bomber contract has been deemed of crucial importance to the future of aircraft manufacturing at Vickers. Although developing three different aircraft types in response to a single Operational Requirement (OR) was costly, events such as the Berlin Blockade had led to a sense of urgency in providing a deterrent to the Soviet Union from possible acts of aggression in Western Europe.Rosemeyer 2009, pp. 52‚Äì53. In April 1948, the Air Staff issued a specification with the designation B.9/48 written around the Type 660 Vickers design; and an 'Instruction to Proceed' was received by Vickers on 16 April 1948. In February 1949, two prototypes of the Vickers 660 series were ordered. The first was to be fitted with four Rolls-Royce RA.3 Avon turbojet engines, while the second was to be fitted with four Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire engines and was designated the Type 667.Andrews and Morgan 1988, p. 438. =Prototypes= First prototype performing a flight display at Farnborough Airshow, 1951 On 18 May 1951, the first prototype, serial number WB210 took to the air for its maiden flight,Andrews and Morgan 1988, p. 439. within the deadline that George Edwards had promised, only 27 months since the contract had been issued. It was several months before a competitor, the Short Sperrin that had straight (not swept) wings and was not orderd. The Valiant pilot was Captain Joseph \\"Mutt\\" Summers, who had also been the original test pilot on the Supermarine Spitfire, and wanted to add another \\"first\\" to his record before he retired. His co-pilot on the first flight was Gabe \\"Jock\\" Bryce, who succeeded Summers as Vickers' chief test pilot upon his retirement shortly afterwards.Turpin 2002, p. 72.Blackman and Wright 2015, p. 10.McLelland 2013, p. 68. The next month, the Vickers Type 660 was given the official name of \\"Valiant\\", recycling the name given to the Vickers Type 131 general-purpose biplane of 1931. The name Valiant had been selected by a survey of Vickers employees.Jones 2007, pp. 31, 33. On 11 January 1952, the first Valiant prototype was lost while making internal noise measurements for the V.1000 programme. Testing included engine shutdowns and re-lights,The Vickers Valiant, C F Andrews, Profile Publications Ltd., P O Box 26, Leatherhead, p.4 one of which caused a fire in the starboard wing; most of the crew managed to escape the aircraft safely, except for the co-pilot, who struck the tail after ejecting.Flight 4 July 1958, p. 13.Blackman and Wright 2015, pp. 11‚Äì16. On 11 April 1952, the second prototype WB215 made its maiden flight, after modifications to the fuel system.Andrews and Morgan 1988, p. 440. It was fitted with more powerful RA.7 Avon engines with thrust each, rather than the Sapphires that had been originally planned; it also featured more rounded air inlets, replacing the narrow slot-type intakes of the first prototype, in order to feed sufficient air to the more powerful engines. The short delay until the second prototype became available meant that loss of the prototype did not compromise the development schedule.Turpin 2002, p. 74.Jones 2007, p. 34. The Valiant B2. One of the three prototypes was the B.2 version.Jones 2007, p. 26. The B.2 was intended to serve as a Pathfinder aircraft, flying at low level to mark targets for the main bomber force. To cope with increased air turbulence at low level, the B.2 had a strengthened airframe. In particular, the wing was strengthened with the removal of the cut-outs in the wing structure into which the main wheels retracted, allowing the wing torsion box structure to be uninterrupted and giving more room for internal fuel storage; instead the main landing gear, which had four wheels instead of the two wheels of the B.1, retracted backwards into large fairings set into the rear of the wings.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 77‚Äì78. The B.2 had a lengthened fuselage with a total length of , in contrast to a length of for the Valiant B.1, with the extra length giving room for more avionics.Jones 2007, pp. 32, 36. The prototype B.2, serial number WJ954 first flew on 4 September 1953.Andrews and Morgan 1988, p. 445. Finished in a gloss black night operations paint scheme, it became known as the \\"Black Bomber\\". Its performance at low level was superior to that of the B.1 (or any other V-bomber), particularly at sea level, with the aircraft being cleared for at low level (with speeds of up to being reached in testing). This was compared to the B.1's sea-level limit of . The Air Ministry ordered 17 production B.2s, which were to be powered by Rolls-Royce Conway turbofans. Although the Valiant B.2's low-level capabilities were significant, the programme was abandoned bacause it was considered that the World War 2 \\"Pathfinder concept\\" was obsolete in the nuclear era.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 78. The B.2 prototype was used for tests for a few years, including testing use of rockets to boost takeoff, contributing to improvements for the Valiant B.1, before being scrapped in 1958.Jones 2007, pp. 36‚Äì37.Brookes 2012, pp. 83‚Äì84. =Production= Valiant B(PR)K.1 WZ393 of 90 Squadron in original all-metal finish displaying at Blackpool Squires Gate airport in 1957 In April 1951, an initial production order for 25 Valiant B.1 (Bomber Mark 1) aircraft was placed by the Ministry of Supply on behalf of the RAF.Burnet and Morgan Aeroplane Monthly August 1980, p. 400. The timing of this order was key to establishing production quickly. Due to shortages of steel and other materials while setting up an assembly line at Brooklands, substantial portions of the production jigs for the Valiant were made from concrete.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 77. The first five Valiants produced were completed to a pre- production standard, the first being WP199. On 21 December 1953, the production aircraft conducted its first flight; this had again occurred within the schedule that Edwards had promised.Jones 2007, p. 37. On 8 February 1955, this first production Valiant was delivered to the RAF.Brookes 2012, p. 12.Flintham 2008, p. 131. Britain's \\"V-bomber\\" force, as it had been nicknamed in October 1952, formally entered operational service on that day. The Victor and Vulcan would soon follow the Valiant into service, for a total of three types of nuclear-armed strategic bombers in RAF service. In September 1957, the final Valiant was delivered. According to Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist, all production aircraft had been delivered on time and below budget. A total of 108 Valiants were manufactured, including the sole B.2 prototype. In addition to its principal role as part of Britain's nuclear deterrent, the Valiant bomber also dropped high explosive bombs. The bombers were followed into service by a strategic reconnaissance version and a multi- purpose version capable conventional bombing, aerial reconnaissance and aerial refuelling. 18 squadron operated 6 Valiants with electronic countermeasures equipment.Blackman and Wright 2015, pp. 19‚Äì20. Valiants of 90 and 214 squadrons were used for air refuelling through the addition of a Hose Drum Unit (HDU) in the bomb bay, mounted on the same suspension units that were also used for bombs. This meant that for refuelling, the bomb-bay doors had to be opened so that the refuelling hose could be streamed (unlike later tankers where the HDU was flush with the under fuselage rather than inside a bomb bay). Several Valiants were also used for testing and development purposes, such as its use as a flying testbed during trials of the Blue Steel nuclear- armed standoff missile, which was later added to the arsenal of munitions the other V-bombers were equipped with.Blackman and Wright 2015, pp. 24‚Äì26.Flintham 2008, p. 133. Unlike the Vulcan and Victor, the Valiant did not see the production of a more capable mark 2 model. In 1962 the Valiant bomber squadrons were switched to a low-level flight profile in order to avoid enemy Surface-to-Air (SAM) defence systems. In 1964 fatigue was discovered due to the increased air turbulence in low level flying and led to the type's premature retirement. Vic Flintham observed that: \\"There is a fine irony to the situation, for Vickers had produced the Type 673 B Mk 2 version designed as a fast, low-level pathfinder... The Air Ministry was not interested...\\" The Valiant was Vickers' last purpose-built military aircraft. It was followed by the Vanguard, a passenger turboprop designed in 1959, and the Vickers VC10, a jet passenger aircraft in 1962, also used as a military transport and tanker by the RAF. Design Forward view of preserved Vickers Valiant XD818 at RAF Museum Cosford The Valiant had a shoulder-mounted wing and four Rolls-Royce Avon RA.3 turbojet engines, each providing up to of thrust, installed in pairs in fireproof bays in each wing root. The design of the Valiant gave an overall impression of a clean aircraft with swept-wing aerodynamics. George Edwards described the Valiant appropriately and simply as an \\"unfunny\\" aircraft.Andrews and Morgan 1988, p. 449. The root chord thickness ratio of 12% allowed the Avon engines to be within the wing rather than on pods as in the contemporary Boeing B-47.Andrews and Morgan, p. 442. This \\"buried engine\\" installation contributed to the aircraft's aerodynamic cleanness, and was British practice at the time. It made engine access for maintenance and repair difficult and increased the risk that an uncontained failure of one engine would cause damage to the adjacent engine; it also increased the complexity of the design of the main spar which had to be routed around the engines.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 73‚Äì74. The wing of the Valiant used a \\"compound sweep\\" configuration, devised by Vickers aerodynamicist Elfyn Richards.Barfield Air International September 1992, p. 158. Richards found that it would be advantageous to increase the sweep on the inboard section of the wing, a discovery which he later patented; the Valiant's wing had 37¬∞ sweepback for the inner third of the wing, which reduced to 21¬∞ at the tips.Burnet and Morgan Aeroplane Monthly August 1980, p. 398.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 74. This was because the thickness/chord ratio could be reduced closer to the tips. The choice to have mild sweepback around the aerodynamic control surfaces meant that in-service speeds were limited to Mach 0.84 and a typical cruise of Mach 0.75 at heights up to when lightly loaded.Andrews 1966, p. 16.Blackman and Wright 2015, pp. 17‚Äì18. A drogue parachute was deemed unnecessary even operating from runways as short as . The wing was mounted high on the aircraft's fuselage and the placement of the engines and main landing gear within the wing limited the fuel that the wing could carry. The trailing edge of the wing had two-section ailerons with trim tabs, and inboard of the ailerons were double-slotted flaps.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 75‚Äì76. Direct electrical drives were used to move the flaps and other hydraulically-operated equipment was used.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 76. The wing root and air intakes Production aircraft were powered by four Avon 201 turbojet engines, with thrust. In addition to providing thrust for flight, the engines also provided bleed air for the pressurization, ice protection, and air conditioning systems. The aircraft's DC electrical generators were also driven by the engines. Napier Spraymat electric heaters were installed in the engine inlets to prevent engine damage due to ice. The shape of the engine inlets were long rectangular slots in the first prototype, whereas production Valiants had oval or \\"spectacle\\" shaped inlets designed to pass greater airflow for the more powerful engines that were installed. The jet exhausts emerged from fairings above the trailing edge of the wings. For required takeoff performance from short tropical dispersal bases,Bombers of the West, Bill Gunston 1973, , p.50 a jettisonable rocket booster engines pack was developed for the Valiant. Trials were performed with two underwing de Havilland Sprite boosters; these were ultimately deemed unnecessary when more powerful variants of the Avon engine became available. Also, there was an increased risk of accidents if one booster rocket failed on takeoff, resulting in asymmetric thrust.Blackman and Wright 2015, p. 20. Some Valiant engines had water injection, which increased takeoff thrust by about per engine.Darling 2012, p. 41. The crew were in a pressurized compartment in the forward fuselage and consisted of a pilot, co-pilot, two navigators, and air signaller (later called an air electronics officer (AEO)).Blackman and Wright 2015, p. 28. Manufacture of this pressurized section was subcontracted to Saunders-Roe. The pilot and co-pilot were located side by side on an upper level, the remaining three crew sat at stations lower in the cockpit, and faced to the rear.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 74‚Äì75. A crew of five had been enabled by the discontinuation of defensive gun turrets and accompanying air gunners, a design philosophy proved by the successful De Havilland Mosquito bomber of World War II. The pilot and copilot were provided with Martin-Baker Mk.3 ejector seats, while the rear crewmen were expected to bail out of the oval main entrance door on the port side of the fuselage.Turpin 2002, pp. 79‚Äì80. It has been claimed that the survivability of the rear crewmen was substantially reduced due to the ineffectiveness of this method of escape. The crewmen's entry door on the side of the forward fuselage The fuselage area behind the pressurised crew section and forward of the wing was used to house much of the Valiant's avionics, and air conditioning equipment, and was sometimes called the \\"organ loft\\".Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 75. The Valiant had twin-wheel nosegear and tandem-wheel main gear that retracted outwards into recesses in the underside of the wing. Each of the main gears were equipped with multipad anti-skid disc brakes, and were telescopically linked so that a single drive motor could pull them up into the wing recesses. Most of the aircraft's systems were electric, including the flaps and undercarriage.Darling 2012, p. 39. The brakes and steering gear were hydraulically powered, the hydraulic pumps being electrically driven. The lower half of the aircraft's nose contained the scanner of the H2S radar in a glass fiber radome; in addition, a visual bomb sight was set beneath the lower floor of the pressurised cockpit. The avionics bay was not accessible from the cockpit but could be accessed via an entrance at the base of the rear fuselage leading to an internal catwalk above the aft of the bomb bay.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 76‚Äì77. The electrics used 112 volt direct current generators, one on each engine, for functions requiring large amounts of electrical power. A 28 V DC system was used for other systems including actuators that initiated the higher-voltage system functions. Backup batteries were a bank of 24 V units and 96 V batteries. 115 V alternating current was provided to systems such as radar; the actuators for the flight surfaces, flaps, air brakes and undercarriage.Flight 4 July 1958, p. 19.Turpin 2002, p. 78. It was decided during development that as much of the aircraft would be electrically driven as was possible; this design choice was due to electrical cabling being lighter than its hydraulic equivalent, and the electrical generators needed for the radar. The flight controls of the Valiant (ailerons, elevator and rudder) consisted of two channels of power control with full manual backup; flying in manual was allowed for training purposes, being designed for operational use in the event of complete electrical failure., and in \\"manual\\" the flight controls required considerable physical effort to operate.Blackman and Wright 2015, p. 18. All three axes of the flight controls had an artificial feel system, the pressure for which was provided via a ram-air inlet. A Smith Aerospace autopilot and instrument landing system (ILS) was installed along with various navigational aids, such as the Marconi Company- built Green Satin doppler radar, Gee radio navigation, Automatic Direction Finder (ADF), VOR/Distance Measuring Equipment (DME), and radar altimeters. Provisions for additional equipment and sensors, such as side looking airborne radar, were also made. Landing gear and wing The centre fuselage of the Valiant had a main backbone beam to support the weight of the two widely-set wing spars and five fuel cells in the upper fuselage. The bomb bay was also in the lower half of the centre fuselage.Flight 4 July 1958, p. 18. The aft fuselage used a semi-monocoque structure, being lighter than the centre fuselage; the Boulton-Paul-produced electro-hydraulic power units for the ailerons, elevators, and rudder were contained within this space. The tail, which was attached to the rear fuselage was tapered rather than swept back, the horizontal tailplane was mounted well up the vertical fin to keep it clear of the engines' exhaust. The tailcone contained a tail warning radar. The main structural components, spars and beams of the Valiant had been constructed from a zinc/magnesium/copper aluminium alloy designated as DTD683 in the UK.Flight 14 December 1951, p. 756.Flight 17 July 1953, p. 91. The Valiant had been designed with a 'Safe-Life' strategy;Brookes Valiant Units of the Cold War, pp. 83. this combination of 'Safe-Life' and DTD683 came to be viewed as a severe mistake. In 1956, a publication within the Journal of the Institute of MetalsThe Journal of the Institute of Metals (JIM), Vol. 86, No. 1790, 1957‚Äì1958. condemned the material DTD683 as being unstable and capable of catastrophic failure when stressing the airframe close to its design limits. The \\"Safe-Life\\" design strategy was dismissed by a Lockheed engineer in a talk given to the Royal Aeronautical Society in 1956, because it did not guarantee safety from catastrophic failure.Flight 6 April 1956, p. 394. The Valiant B.1 could carry a single nuclear weapon or up to 21 conventional bombs in its bomb bay. It was designed for the early fission-based nuclear weapons and also the newer and larger thermonuclear hydrogen bombs. A \\"clean\\" Valiant (one without underwing tanks) could climb straight to 50,000 ft after takeoff unless it had heavy stores in the large bomb bay. In the aerial reconnaissance role, a camera crate would be installed in the bomb bay, along with a pair of cameras set into the fuselage and larger rear fuel tanks to extend the aircraft's endurance.Blackman and Wright 2015, p. 19. Large external fuel tanks under each wing with a capacity of , could be used to extend range; an auxiliary fuel tank could also be installed in the forward area of the bomb bay; the external wing tanks were fitted as standard on Valiants that were operated as aerial refuelling tankers. For receiving fuel, a fixed refuelling probe was fitted onto the aircraft's nose, this was connected to the fuel tanks via a pipe running along the outside of the canopy to avoid penetrating the pressure cabin.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 79. Operational history=Nuclear deterrent= Yellow Sun nuclear bomb under the wing of Vickers Valiant XD818 at the RAF Cosford museum The first squadron to be equipped with the Valiant was 138 Squadron, which formed at RAF Gaydon on 1 January 1955, with 232 Operational Conversion Unit forming at Gaydon on 21 February 1955 to convert crews to the new bomber. Since the Valiant was part of an entirely new class of bombers for the RAF, the crews for the new type were selected from experienced aircrew, with first pilots requiring 1,750 flying hours as an aircraft captain, with at least one tour flying the Canberra, with second pilots needing 700 hours in command and the remaining three crewmembers had to be recommended for posting to the Valiant by their commanding officers.Jones 2007, pp. 79‚Äì82. Valiants were originally assigned to the strategic nuclear bombing role, as were the Vulcan and Victor B.1s when they became operational. At its peak, the Valiant equipped ten RAF squadrons.Wynn, pp. 564-565. According to Gunston and Gilchrist, the Valiant had performed \\"extremely well\\" during the annual bombing competition hosted by American Strategic Air Command (SAC). American interest in the Valiant resulted in a visit to Vickers by USAF generals Vandenberg, Johnson and LeMay. Vickers test-pilot Brian Trubshaw believed that George Edwards was put under some pressure to build the Boeing B-47 under license. The only result from the visit was Le May's insistence that the Valiant pilot side-by-side seating be incorporated in the B-52 instead of the tandem arrangement in the B-47 and prototype B-52.Brian Trubshaw Test Pilot, Brian Trubshaw and Sally Edmondson, Sutton Publishing Limited 1999, , p.35 On 11 October 1956, a Valiant B.1 (WZ366) of No 49 Squadron was the first RAF aircraft to drop a British atomic bomb when it performed a test drop of a down-rated Blue Danube weapon on Maralinga, South Australia.Mason 1994, p. 378. Windscreen blinds were fitted in advance of the test to protect the crew from the intense flash of light from the nuclear detonation. Following the landing of the aircraft after deploying the weapon, WZ366 was assessed for potential damage and for radioactive contamination.Blackman and Wright 2015, pp. 33‚Äì36. On 15 May 1957, a Valiant B(K).1 (XD818) dropped the first British hydrogen bomb, the Short Granite, over the Pacific as part of Operation Grapple. No 49 Squadron was selected to perform the live weapon drop, and were equipped with specially-modified Valiants to conform with the scientific requirements of the tests and other precautionary measures to protect against heat and radiation.Hubbard and Simmons 2008, pp. 61, 68. However, the measured yield was less than a third of the maximum expected although achieving a thermonuclear explosion. On 8 November 1957 a British hydrogen bomb detonated with its planned yield in the Grapple X test.Hubbard and Simmons 2008, p. 157. The Grapple series of tests continued into 1958, and in April 1958 the Grapple Y bomb exploded with ten times the yield of the original \\"Short Granite\\".Hubbard and Simmons 2008, p. 167. Testing was finally terminated in November 1958, when the British government decided it would perform no more air-delivered nuclear tests. Originally the bombing role was to have been carried out at high altitude, but following the shooting down in 1960 of the Lockheed U-2 flown by Gary Powers by an early Soviet SA-2 Guideline missile, the SAM threat caused bomber squadrons to train for low-level attack as a means of avoiding radar detection when flying within hostile airspace. They were repainted in grey/green camouflage with normal markings, replacing their anti-flash white scheme. By 1963, four Valiant squadrons (49, 148, 207 and 214) had been assigned to SACEUR in the low-level tactical bombing role. By this point, there had been a noticeable decline in flying rates for the type. =Conventional warfare= Filton, England. Circa mid-1960s Peacetime practice involved the dropping of small practice bombs on instrumented bombing ranges, and a system of predicted bombing using radio tones to mark the position of the bomb drop over non-range targets, the bomb error being calculated by a ground radar unit and passed either to the crew during flight or to a headquarters for analysis. Use of the Valiant's Navigational and Bombing System (NBS) and the high quality of assigned crews, who were typically veterans and often had been previously decorated for wartime service, meant a high level of bombing accuracy could be achieved, greater than that of aircraft during the Second World War. According to Gunston and Gilchrist, Valiant crews were able to place practice bombs from an altitude of within a few meters of their assigned target. In October and November 1956 the Valiant was the first of the V-bombers to see combat, during the Anglo-French-Israeli Suez campaign. During Operation Musketeer, the British military operation in what became known as the Suez Crisis, Valiants operating from the airfield at Luqa on Malta dropped conventional bombs on targets inside Egypt. Egyptian military airfields were the principal target; other targets included communications such as radio stations and transport hubs.Bowman 2016, p. 158 On the first night of the operation, six Valiants were dispatched to bomb Cairo West Air Base (which was aborted in flight due to potential risk to US personnel in the vicinity) while six more attacked Almaza Air Base and a further five bombed Kibrit Air Base and Huckstep Barracks.Blackman and Wright 2015, p. 42.Darling 2012, p. 42. Although the Egyptians did not oppose the attacks and there were no Valiant combat losses, the results of the raids were reported as disappointing. Although the Valiants dropped a total of of bombs, only three of the seven airfields attacked were seriously damaged. The Egyptian Air Force had been effectively destroyed in a wider series of multinational attacks of which the Valiant bombing missions had been a part.Bowman 2016, pp. 158, 161. It was the last time RAF V-bombers flew a live combat mission until Avro Vulcans bombed Port Stanley airfield in the Falkland Islands during the Falklands War in 1982.McClelland, pp.175‚Äì178. =Tanker operations= Valiant tankers were flown by No. 214 Squadron at RAF Marham, operational in 1958, and No. 90 Squadron at Honington, operational in 1959. The two squadrons became full-time tanker squadrons on 1 April 1962.Brookes 1982, p. 142 Aircraft assigned to the tanker role were fitted with a Hose Drum Unit (HDU or \\"HooDoo\\") in the bomb bay. The HDU was mounted on bomb-mounting points and could be removed if necessary; this arrangement meant that the bomb bay doors had to be opened in order to give fuel to a receiver aircraft. A control panel at the radar navigator station in the cockpit was used to operate the HDU. The HDU equipment was removable so that the aircraft could be reverted to the bomber role if required.Tanner 2006, pp. 113‚Äì114. With in-flight refuelling probes fitted to Valiants, Vulcans and Victors and Valiant tankers available to give fuel and extend the range of the aircraft being refuelled, the RAF Medium Bomber Force could go beyond \\"medium range\\", and the RAF had a long range capability. Long-range demonstration flights were made using Valiant tankers pre-deployed along the route. In 1960, a Valiant bomber flew non-stop from Marham in the UK to Singapore and in 1961 a Vulcan flew non-stop from the UK to Australia.Hubbard and Simmons 2008, p. 26. The two tanker squadrons regularly practised long range missions, refuelled by other Valiant tankers on the way. These included non-stop flights from the UK to Nairobi, RAF Gan and Singapore.Brookes 1982, pp. 141‚Äì142 In 1963 a squadron of Gloster Javelin fighters was refuelled by tankers and flew in stages from the UK to India (Exercise \\"Shiksha\\") to support the Indian Air Force in a dispute over their border with China. Other aircraft refuelled by Valiants at this time included Victor and Vulcan bombers, English Electric Lightning fighters, and de Havilland Sea Vixen and Supermarine Scimitar fighters of the Royal Navy.Wynn 1994, p. 168. =Countermeasures and reconnaissance roles= Valiants of No. 18 Squadron RAF at RAF Finningley were modified to the \\"radio countermeasures\\" (RCM) role‚Äînow called \\"electronic countermeasures\\" (ECM). These aircraft were ultimately fitted with American APT-16A and ALT-7 jamming transmitters, Airborne Cigar and Carpet jammers, APR-4 and APR-9 \\"sniffing\\" receivers, and chaff dispensers. At least seven Valiants were configured to the RCM role.Brookes 2012, pp. 45‚Äì46. Valiants of No. 543 Squadron at RAF Wyton were modified to serve in the photographic reconnaissance role. In one notable operation in 1965, Valiants of No. 543 Squadron photographed around of Rhodesia across an 11-week period. =Fatigue failures and retirement= In 1956, Vickers had performed a series of low level tests in WZ383 to assess the type for low level flight at high speed. Several modifications to the aircraft were made, including a metal radome, debris guards on the two inboard engines, and after six flights the aileron and elevator artificial feel was reduced by 50%. Pilots reported problems with cabin heating and condensation that would need remedying. The aircraft was fitted with data recording equipment and these data were used by Vickers to estimate the remaining safe life of the type under these flying conditions. Initially a safe life of 75 hours was recommended, which became \\"the real figure might be less than 200 hours\\".Morgan p. 66-68 The number of hours flown by each Valiant in a year was an operational issue for the RAF.Valiant Units of the Cold War, Brookes p. 88. Vickers Valiant on display Later the RAE ran a similar series of tests that more closely resembled actual operational conditions including low level and taxiing; the corresponding report published in 1958 produced data that could be used to get a better grasp on which flight conditions produced the most damage, and enable a better projection of the future life span for the type.\\"Fatigue Loadings in Flight-Loads in the Nose Undercarriage and Wing of a Valiant.\\" E.W. Wells, ARC C.P. No. 521. In May 1957 Flight reported an \\"incident at Boscombe Down, when a Valiant rear spar was damaged after a rocket-assisted takeoff at overload weight (the reason for the rocket-assistance)\\"Flight 17 May 1957, p. 651 This aircraft was the second prototype WB 215; it was subsequently broken up for wing fatigue testing after it had flown 489 hours.Morgan p. 44 & p. 89. After years of front-line service, in July 1964, a cracked spar was found in one of the three Valiants (either WZ394 ‚Äì Wynne, or WZ389 ‚Äì Morgan) on Operation Pontifex.Wynn p. 469. This was followed on 6 August by a failure of the starboard wing rear spar at 30,000 ft,Brookes, Victor Units of the Cold War, p. 67. in WP217, an OCU aircraft from Gaydon captained by Flight Lieutenant \\"Taffy\\" Foreman. The aircraft landed back at Gaydon but without flap deployment because damage to the starboard rear spar caused the flap rollers to come out of their guides so that the flap would not lower on that side. Later inspection of the aircraft also showed the fuselage skin below the starboard inner plane had buckled, popping the rivets; the engine door had cracked and the rivets had been pulled and the skin buckled on the top surface of the mainplane between the two engines.Darling 2012, pp. 39‚Äì40. Both of these aircraft were PR variants.Morgan, App 2, Individual Valiant Histories pp. 89‚Äì94. Inspections of the entire fleet showed that the wing spars were suffering from fatigue at between 35% and 75% of the assessed safe fatigue life, probably due to low level turbulence.Darling 2012, p. 40. After this inspection, the aircraft were divided into three categories, Cat A aircraft continuing to fly, Cat B to fly to a repair base, and Cat C requiring repair before flying again. The tanker squadrons had the highest proportion of Cat A aircraft because their role had been mainly at high level. This also caused the methods of assessing fatigue lives to be reviewed.Wynn 1996, p. 465. By the time the type was scrapped, only about 50 aircraft were still in service; the rest had been slowly accumulating at various RAF Maintenance Units designated as \\"Non effective Aircraft\\".Morgan App2, pp. 89‚Äì94. Initially there was no question of retiring the type, or even a majority of affected aircraft. Repairs were actively taking place at Valiant bases such as Marham using working parties from Vickers plus RAF technicians from the base. In January 1965, the Wilson government with Denis Healey as Secretary of State for Defence decided that the expense of the repairs could not be justified, given the short operational life left to the Valiant, and the fleet was permanently grounded as of 26 January 1965.\\"Valiants to be Scrapped.\\" Glasgow Herald, 27 January 1965. The QRA alert that had been in place for SACEUR was maintained until the final grounding.Wynn 1996, pp. 464‚Äì471, 500. When asked to make a statement regarding the Valiant's scrapping in the House of Commons, Denis Healey stated that it \\"was not in any way connected with low-level flying\\" and that the \\"last Government took the decision to continue operating the Valiant force for another four years after its planned fatigue life was complete\\". Aviation author Barry Jones commented in his book that: \\"A question has to be asked. For two years before the demise of the Valiant, Handley Page at Radlett had 100 Hastings go through their shops. They were completely dismantled and rebuilt, having DTD683 components removed and replaced by new alloy sections. What was so special about the Hastings and why was the Valiant not treated similarly? Perhaps we will know one day ‚Äì but I doubt it.\\"\\"V-Bombers\\" Barry Jones p. 117. A Flight report about the scrapping states \\"Fatigue affected all Valiants ... not only those that had been used for some low flying\\". On 9 December 1964, the last Valiant tanker sortie in XD812 of 214 Squadron was refuelling Lightning aircraft over the North Sea and was recalled to land back at Marham before the scheduled exercise was completed. On the same day, the last Valiant bomber sortie was carried out by XD818. Variants Including the three prototypes, a total of 107 Valiants were built.Brookes 2012, p. 45. * Valiant B.1: 37 pure bomber variants, including five pre-production Type 600, Type 667 and Type 674s, which were powered by Avon RA.14 engines with the same thrust each as the earlier Avon 201 and 34 Type 706 full-production aircraft, powered by Avon RA.28, 204 or 205 engines with thrust each, longer tailpipes and water-methanol injection for takeoff boost power. * Type 710 Valiant B(PR).1: eleven bomber/photo-reconnaissance aircraft. Edwards and his team had considered use of the Valiant for photo-reconnaissance from the start, and this particular type of aircraft could accommodate a removable \\"crate\\" in the bomb-bay, carrying up to eight narrow-view/high resolution cameras and four survey cameras. * Type 733 Valiant B(PR)K.1: 14 bomber/photo- reconnaissance/tanker aircraft. * Type 758 Valiant B(K).1: 44 bomber / tanker aircraft. Both tanker variants carried a removable tanker system in the bomb bay, featuring fuel tanks and a hose-and-drogue aerial refuelling system. A further 16 Valiant B(K).1s were ordered, but cancelled. * Valiant B.2: 1 prototype. * Vickers also considered an air transport version of the Valiant, with a low-mounted wing, wingspan increased from to , fuselage lengthened to , and uprated engines. Work on a prototype, designated the Type 1000, began in early 1953. The prototype was to lead to a military transport version, the Type 1002, and a civilian transport version, the Type 1004 or VC.7. The Type 1000 prototype was almost complete when it, too, was cancelled. Valiant production ended in August 1957. An order for 17 B.2 models was cancelled.

The first of these wars was the result of Rome's intervening to rescue the Campanian city of Capua from a Samnite attack. The second one was the result of Rome's intervention in the politics of the city of Naples and developed into a contest over the control of much of central and southern Italy. The third war also involved a struggle over the control of this part of Italy. The wars extended over half a century and the peoples to the east, north and west of Samnium (land of the Samnites) as well as the peoples of central Italy north of Rome (the Etruscans, Umbrians and Picenti) and the Senone Gauls got involved to various degrees and at various points in time. The Samnites were one of early Rome's most formidable rivals. Background By the time of the first of these wars, the southward expansion of Rome's territory had reached the River Liris (see Liri), which was the boundary between Latium (land of the Latins) and Campania. This river is now called Garigliano and it is the boundary between the modern regions of Lazio and Campania. In those days the name Campania referred to the plain between the coast and the Apennine Mountains which stretched from the River Liris down to the bays of Naples and Salerno. The northern part of this area was inhabited by the Sidicini, the Aurunci and the Ausoni (a subgroup of the Aurunci). The central and southern part was inhabited by the Campanians, who were people who had migrated from Samnium (land of the Samnites) and were closely related to the Samnites, but had developed their distinctive identity. The Samnites were a confederation of four tribes who lived in the mountains to the east of Campania and were the most powerful people in the area. The Samnites, Campanians and Sidicini spoke Oscan languages. Their languages were part of the Osco-Umbrian linguistic family, which also included Umbrian and the Sabellian languages to the north of Samnium. The Lucanians who lived to the south were also Oscan speakers. Diodorus Siculus and Livy report that in 354 BC Rome and the Samnites concluded a treaty,Diodorus, xvi.45.7.Livy, vii.19.3‚Äì4. but neither lists the terms agreed upon. Modern historians have proposed that the treaty established the river Liris as the boundary between their spheres of influence, with Rome's lying to its north and the Samnites' to its south. This arrangement broke down when the Romans intervened south of the Liris to rescue the Campanian city of Capua (just north of Naples) from an attack by the Samnites. First Samnite War (343 to 341 BC) Livy is the only preserved source to give a continuous account of the war which has become known in modern historiography as the First Samnite War. In addition, the Fasti Triumphales records two Roman triumphs dating to this war and some of the events described by Livy are also mentioned by other ancient writers. =Outbreak=Livy's account According to Livy, the First Samnite War started not because of any enmity between Rome and the Samnites, but due to outside events.Livy, vii.29.3 The spark came when the Samnites without provocation attacked the Sidicini,Livy, vii.29.4 a tribe living north of Campania with their chief settlement at Teanum Sidicinum. Unable to stand against the Samnites, the Sidicini sought help from the Campanians.Livy, vii.29.4 However, Livy continues, the Samnites defeated the Campanians in a battle in Sidicine territory and then turned their attention toward Campania. First they seized the Tifata hills overlooking Capua (the main Campanian city) and, having left a strong force to hold them, marched into the plain between the hills and Capua.Livy, vii.29.5‚Äì6 There they defeated the Campanians in a second battle and drove them within their walls. This compelled the Campanians to ask Rome for help.Livy, vii.29.5‚Äì7 In Rome, the Campanian ambassadors were admitted to an audience with the Senate. In a speech, they proposed an alliance between Rome and the Campanians, noting how the Campanians with their famous wealth could be of aid to the Romans, and that they could help to subdue the Volsci, who were enemies of Rome. They pointed out that nothing in Rome's treaty with the Samnites prevented them from also making a treaty with the Campanians, and warning that if they did not, the Samnites would conquer Campania and its strength would be added to the Samnites' instead of the Romans'.Livy, vii.30.1‚Äì23 After discussing this proposal, the Senate concluded that while there was much to be gained from a treaty with the Campanians, and that this fertile area could become Rome's granary, Rome could not ally with them and still be considered loyal to their existing treaty with the Samnites: for this reason they had to refuse the proposal.Livy, vii.31.1‚Äì2 After being informed of Rome's refusal, the Campanian embassy, in accordance with their instructions, surrendered the people of Campania and the city of Capua unconditionally into the power of Rome.Livy, vii.31.3‚Äì5 Moved by this surrender, the Senators resolved that Rome's honour now required that the Campanians and Capua, who by their surrender had become the possession of Rome, be protected from Samnite attacks.Livy, vii.31.6‚Äì7 Envoys were sent to the Samnites with the introductions to request that they, in view of their mutual friendship with Rome, spare territory which had become the possession of Rome and to warn them to keep their hands off the city of Capua and the territory of Campania.Livy, vii.31.8‚Äì10 The envoys delivered their message as instructed to the Samnites' national assembly. However, they were met with a defiant response, \\"not only did the Samnites declare their intention of waging war against Capua, but their magistrates left the council chamber, and in tones loud enough for the envoys to hear, ordered [their armies] to march out at once into Campanian territory and ravage it.\\"Livy, vii.31.11‚Äì12 When this news reached Rome, the fetials were sent to demand redress, and when this was refused Rome declared war against the Samnites.Livy, vii.32.1‚Äì2 Modern views The historical accuracy of Livy's account is disputed among modern historians. They are willing to accept that while Livy might have simplified the way in which the Sidicini, Campani and Samnites came to be at war, his narrative here, at least in outline, is historical. The Sidicini's stronghold at Teanum controlled an important regional crossroads, which would have provided the Samnites with a motive for conquest. The First Samnite War might have started quite by accident, as Livy claimed. The Sidicini were located on the Samnite side of the river Liris, and while the Roman-Samnite treaty might only have dealt with the middle Liris, not the lower, Rome does not appear to have been overly concerned for the fate of the Sidicini. The Samnites could therefore go to war with Sidicini without fear of Roman involvement. It was only the unforeseen involvement of the Campani that brought in the Romans. Many historians have however had difficulty accepting the historicity of the Campanian embassy to Rome, in particular whether Livy was correct in describing the Campani as surrendering themselves unconditionally into Roman possession. That Capua and Rome were allied in 343 is less controversial, as such a relationship underpins the whole First Samnite War. Historians have noted the similarities between the events leading to the First Samnite War and events, which according to Thucydides, caused the Peloponnesian War, but there are differences as well. It is clear that Livy, or his sources, has consciously modelled the Campanian embassy after the \\"Corcyrean debate\\" in Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War. There are many parallels between the speech given by the Campanian ambassador to the Roman senate in Livy and the speech of the Corcyrean ambassador to the Athenian assembly in Thucydides. But while Thucydides' Athenians debate the Corcyreans' proposal in pragmatic terms, Livy's senators decide to reject the Campanian alliance based on moral arguments. Livy might have intended his literary educated readers to pick up this contrast. The exaggerated misery of the surrendering Campani contrast with the Campanian arrogance, a stock motif in ancient Roman literature. It is also unlikely that Livy's description of the Samnite national assembly is based on any authentic sources. However, it does not necessarily follow that because the speeches are invented, a standard feature for ancient historians, the Campanian surrender must be invented as well. The chief difficulty lies in how, in 343, rich Capua could have been reduced to such dire straits by the Samnites that the Campani were willing to surrender everything to Rome. During the Second Punic War (218 to 201 BC), Capua famously sided with Carthage, but after a lengthy siege by Rome, she had to surrender unconditionally in 211 BC, after which the Capuans were harshly punished by the Romans. therefore held that the Campanian surrender in 343 is a retrojection by later Roman historians. This invention would serve the double purpose of exonerating Rome from treaty-breaking in 343 BC and justifying the punishment handed out in 211 BC. What Rome agreed to in 343 was an alliance on terms similar to the treaties she had with the Latins and the Hernici. accepts the surrender as historical. Studies have shown that voluntary submission was a common feature in the diplomacy of this period. Likewise does not believe the surrender of 343 BC to be a retrojection, not finding many similarities between the events of 343 and 211. The ancient historians record many later instances, whose historicity are not doubted, where a state appealed to Rome for assistance in war against a stronger enemy. The historical evidence shows the Romans considering such supplicants to have technically the same status as surrendered enemies, but in practice, Rome would not want to abuse would-be allies. , like Salmon, argues that the surrender in 343 is a retrojection of that of 211, invented to better justify Roman actions and for good measure shift the guilt for the First Samnite War onto the manipulative Campani. Livy portrays the Romans selflessly assuming the burden of defending the Campani, but this is a common theme in Roman republican histories, whose authors wished to show that Rome's wars had been just. Military success was the chief road to prestige and glory among the highly competitive Roman aristocracy. Evidence from later, better documented, time periods shows the Roman Senate quite capable of manipulating diplomatic circumstances so as to provide just causes for an expansionary wars. There is no reason to believe this was not also the case in the second half of the 4th century BC. There are also recorded examples of Rome rejecting appeals for help, implying that the Romans in 343 BC had the choice of rejecting the Campani. =Three Roman victories= Samnite soldiers from a tomb frieze in Nola, 4th century BC According to Livy, the two Roman consuls for 343 BC, Marcus Valerius Corvus and Aulus Cornelius Cossus, both marched against the Samnites. Valerius led his army into Campania, while Cornelius, into Samnium where he camped at Saticula.Livy, vii.32.2 Livy then goes on to narrate how Rome won three different battles against the Samnites. After a day of hard fighting, Valerius won the first battle, fought at Mount Gaurus near Cumae, only after a last desperate charge in fading daylight.Livy, vii.32.2-.33.18 The second battle almost ended in disaster for the Romans when the Samnites attempted to trap the other consul, Cornelius Cossus, and his army in a mountain pass. Fortunately for them, one of Cornelius' military tribunes, Publius Decius Mus with a small detachment, seized a hilltop, distracting the Samnites and allowing the Roman army to escape the trap. Decius and his men slipped away to safety during the night; the morning after the unprepared Samnites were attacked and defeated.Livy, vii.33.1-.37.3; Frontin. strat., i.5.14, iv.5.9; Cic. diu., i.51 Still determined to seize victory, the Samnites collected their forces and laid siege to Suessula at the eastern edge of Campania. Leaving his baggage behind, Marcus Valerius took his army on forced marches to Suessula. Low on supplies, and underestimating the size of the Roman force, the Samnites scattered their army to forage for food. This gave Valerius the opportunity to win a third Roman victory when he first captured the Samnites' lightly defended camp and then scattered their foragers.Livy, vii.37.4-.18 These Roman successes against the Samnites convinced Falerii to convert her forty year's truce with Rome into a permanent peace treaty, and the Latins to abandon their planned war against Rome and instead campaign against the Paeligni. The friendly city- state of Carthage sent a congratulatory embassy to Rome with a twenty-five pound crown for the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus. Both consuls then celebrated triumphs over the Samnites.Livy, vii.38.1‚Äì3 The Fasti Triumphales records that Valerius and Cornelius celebrated their triumphs over the Samnites on 21 September and 22 September respectively. Modern historians have doubted the historical accuracy of Livy's description of these three battles. Livy's battle-scenes for this time period are mostly free reconstructions by him and his sources, and there are no reasons why these should be different.Oakley(1998), p. 310 The number of Samnites killed and the amounts of spoils taken by the Romans have clearly been exaggerated.Salmon(1967), p. 198; Oakley(1998), p. 358 Historians have noted the many similarities between the story of Publius Decius Mus, and an event said to have taken place in Sicily in 258 when the Romans were fighting the First Punic War against Carthage. According to the ancient sources, a Roman army was in danger of being trapped in a defile when a military tribune led a detachment of 300 men to seize a hilltop in the middle of the enemy. The Roman army escaped, but of the 300 only the tribune survived. It is unlikely that this latter, in ancient times more famous, episode has not influenced the descriptions of the former.Salmon(1967) p. 198; Oakley(1998), pp. 332‚Äì333; Forsythe(2005), p. 288 Salmon(1967) also found several other similarities between the campaigns of 343 and later events which he considered to be doublets. Both the First and the Second Samnite Wars start with an invasion of Samnium by a Cornelius, the way in which a Roman army was led into a trap resembles the famous disaster at the Caudine Forks in 321 BC, and there are similarities to the campaigns of Publius Cornelius Arvina in 306 BC and Publius Decius Mus (the son of the hero of Saticula) in 297 BC. He also thought Valerius Corvus' two Campanian victories could be doublets of Roman operations against Hannibal in the same area in 215Salmon(1967), pp. 199‚Äì198 On the other hand, the entries in the Fasti Triumphales supports some measure of Roman success. In Salmon's reconstruction, therefore, there was only one battle in 343 BC, perhaps fought on the outskirts of Capua near the shrine of Juno Gaura, and ending with a narrow Roman victory.Salmon(1967), p. 201 Oakley(1998) dismisses these claims of doublets and inclines towards believing there were three battles. The Samnites would have gained significant ground in Campania by the time the Romans arrived and Valerius' two victories could be the outcome of twin Samnite attacks on Capua and Cumae. And while Samnite ambushes are somewhat of a stock motif in Livy's narrative of the Samnite wars, this might simply reflect the mountainous terrain in which these wars were fought.Oakley(1998), pp. 310‚Äì311 The story of Decius, as preserved, has been patterned after that of the military tribune of 258, but Decius could still have performed some heroic act in 343, the memory of which became the origin of the later embellished tale.Oakley(1998), p. 333 Forsythe(2005) considers the episode with Cornelius Cossus and Decius Mus to have been invented, in part to foreshadow Decius' sacrifice in 340 BC. P. Decius might have performed some heroic act which then enabled him to become the first of his family to reach the consulship in 340, but if so, no detail of the historical event survives. Instead, later annalists have combined the disaster at the Caudine Forks with the tale of the military tribune of 258 BC to produce the entirely fictitious story recorded by Livy; the difference being that while in the originals the Romans suffered defeat and death, here none of Decius' men are killed and the Romans win a great victory.Forsythe(2005), p. 288 =End of the war= No fighting is reported for 342. Instead the sources focus on a mutiny by part of the soldiery. According to the most common variant, following the Roman victories of 343 the Campani asked Rome for winter garrisons to protect them against the Samnites. Subverted by the luxurious lifestyle of the Campani, the garrison soldiers started plotting to seize control and set themselves up as masters of Campania. However the conspiracy was discovered by the consuls of 342 before the coup could be carried out. Afraid of being punished, the plotters mutinied, formed a rebel army and marched against Rome. Marcus Valerius Corvus was nominated dictator to deal with the crisis; he managed to convince the mutineers to lay down their arms without bloodshed and a series of economic, military and political reforms were passed to deal with their grievances.Livy, vii.38.4‚Äì42.7; D.H. xv.3.2‚Äì15; App. Samn. 1‚Äì2 The history of this mutiny is however disputed among modern historians and it is possible that the whole narrative has been invented to provide a background for the important reforms passed that year.Oakley(1998), pp. 363‚Äì364; Forsythe(2005), p. 273 These reforms included the Leges Genuciae which stated that no one could be reelected to the same office within less than ten years, and it is clear from the list of consuls that, except in years of great crises, this law was enforced. It also became a firm rule that one of the consuls had to be a plebeian.Forsythe (2006), pp. 270, 273 Livy writes that in 341 BC one of the Roman consuls, Lucius Aemilius Mamercus, entered Samnite territory but found no army to oppose him. He was ravaging their territory when Samnite envoys came to ask for peace. When presenting their case to the Roman Senate, the Samnite envoys stressed their former treaty with the Romans, which unlike the Campani, they had formed in times of peace, and that the Samnites now intended to go to war against the Sidicini who were no friends of Rome. The Roman praetor, Ti. Aemilius, delivered the reply of the Senate: Rome was willing to renew her former treaty with the Samnites; moreover, Rome would not involve herself in the Samnites' decision to make war or peace with the Sidicini. Once peace had been concluded the Roman army withdrew from Samnium.Livy, viii.1.7‚Äì2.4 The impact of Aemilius' invasion of Samnium may have been exaggerated;Oakley (1998), p. 394 it could even have been entirely invented by a later writer to bring the war to an end with Rome in a suitably triumphant fashion.Oakley (1998), p. 311 The sparse mentions of praetors in the sources for the 4th century BC are generally thought to be historical; it is possible therefore that as praetor Ti. Aemilius really was involved in the peace negotiations with the Samnites.Oakley (1998), p. 394 The First Samnite War ended in a negotiated peace rather than one state dominating the other. The Romans had to accept that the Sidicini belonged to the Samnite sphere, but their alliance with the Campani was a far greater prize. Campania's wealth and manpower were a major addition to Rome's strength.Salmon (1967), p. 202; Forsythe (2005), p. 288 =Historicity of the war= The many problems with Livy's account and Diodorus' failure to mention it has even caused some historians to reject the entire war as unhistorical. More recent historians have however accepted the basic historicity of the war. No Roman historian would have invented a series of events so unflattering to Rome. Livy was clearly embarrassed at the way Rome had turned from being an ally to an enemy of the Samnites. It is also unlikely that the Romans could have established such a dominating position in Campania as they had after 341 without Samnite resistance. Finally Diodorus ignores many other events in early Roman history such as all the early years of the Second Samnite War; his omission of the First Samnite War can therefore not be taken as proof of its unhistoricity. Second (or Great) Samnite War (326 to 304 BC)=Outbreak= The Second Samnite War resulted from tensions which arose from Roman interventions in Campania. The immediate precipitants were the foundation of a Roman colony (settlement) at Fregellae in 328 BC and actions taken by the inhabitants of Paleopolis. Fregellae had been a Volscian town on the eastern branch of the River Liris, at the junction with the River Tresus (today's Sacco) ‚Äì viz., in Campania and in an area which was to be under Samnite control. It had been taken from the Volsci and destroyed by the Samnites. Paleopolis (\\"old city\\") was the older settlement of what is now Naples (which was a Greek city) and was very close to the newer and larger settlement of Neapolis (\\"new city\\"). Livy said that it attacked Romans who lived in Campania. Rome asked for redress, but they were rebuffed and she declared war. In 327 BC the two consular armies headed for Campania. The consul Quintus Publilius Philo took on Naples. His colleague Lucius Cornelius Lentulus positioned himself inland to check the movements of the Samnites because of reports that there had been a levy in Samnium that intended to intervene, in anticipation of a rebellion in Campania. Lentulus set up a permanent camp. The nearby Campanian city of Nola sent 2000 troops to Paleopolis/Neapolis and the Samnites sent 4000. In Rome there was also a report that the Samnites were encouraging rebellions in the towns of Privernum Fundi, and Formiae (Volscian towns north of the River Liris). Rome sent envoys to Samnium. The Samnites denied that they were preparing for war, that they had not interfered in Formiae and Fundi, and said that the Samnite men were not sent to Paleopolis by their government. They also complained about the founding of Fregellae, which they thought was as an act of aggression against them, as they had recently overrun that area. They called for war in Campania.Livy, viii, 8.22‚Äì23 There had been tensions prior to these events. In 337 BC a war broke out between the Aurunci and the Sidicini. The Romans decided to help the Aurunci because they had not fought Rome during the First Samnite War. Meanwhile, the ancient city of Aurunca was destroyed, and so they fled to Suessa Aurunca, which they fortified. In 336 BC the Ausoni joined the Sidicini. The Romans defeated the forces of these two peoples in a minor battle. In 335 BC one of the two Roman consuls besieged, seized and garrisoned Cales, the main town of the Ausoni. The army was then sent to march on the Sidicini so that the other consul could share the glory. In 334 BC, 2500 civilians were sent to Cales to set up a Roman colony there. The Romans ravaged the territory of the Sidicini and there were reports that in Samnium there had been calls for war with Rome for two years. Therefore, the Roman troops were kept in Sidicini territory. There were also tensions north of the River Liris, in the Volscian territory. In 330 BC the Volscian towns of Fabrateria and Luca offered Rome overlordship over them in exchange for protection from the Samnites and the senate sent a warning to the Samnites not to attack their territories. The Samnites agreed. According to Livy this was because they were not ready for war. In the same year the Volscian towns of Privernum and Fundi rebelled and ravaged the territories of another Volscian town and two Roman colonies in the area. When the Romans sent an army Fundi quickly pledged its loyalty. In 329 BC, Privernum either fell or surrendered (this is unclear). Its ringleaders were sent to Rome, its walls were pulled down and a garrison was stationed there.Livy, viii, 8.19‚Äì21 In Livy's account there is a sense that the peace with the Samnites had been on a thin edge for years. It has also to be noted that Cales was in an important strategic position not only for the route from Rome to Capua but also for some of the routes which gave access to the mountains of Samnium. Yet the Samnites had not responded militarily to Roman interventions in Campania. One factor might have been the conflict between the Lucanians (the Samnites‚Äô southerly neighbours) and the Greek city of Taras (Tarentum in Latin, modern Taranto) on the Ionian Sea. The Tarentines called for the help of the Greek king Alexander of Epirus, who crossed over to Italy in 334 BC. In 332 BC Alexander landed at Paestum, which was close to Samnium and Campania. The Samnites joined the Lucanians and the two were defeated by Alexander, who then established friendly relations with Rome. However, Alexander was killed in battle in 331 or 330 BC.Livy, viii, 8.17, 8.24Justin: Epitome of the Philippic History of Pompeius Trogus, 12.2 The grievance of the Samnites about Fregellae might have been an addition to aggravations caused by Roman policy in Campania in the previous eight years. =From 327 BC to 322 BC= Quintus Publilius Philo positioned his army between Paleopolis and Neapolis to isolate them from each other. Meanwhile, the Romans introduced an institutional novelty: Publilius Philo and Cornelius Lentulus should have gone back to Rome at the end of their term (to make way for the consuls elected for the next year, who would continue the military operations), instead, their military command (but not their authority as civilian heads of the Republic) was extended until the termination of the campaigns with the title of proconsuls. In 326 BC two leading men of Naples, who were dissatisfied with the misbehaviour of the Samnite soldiers in the city, arranged a plot, which enabled the Romans to take the city, and called for renewed friendship with Rome. In Samnium the towns of Allifae, Callifae, and Rufrium were taken by the Romans. The Lucanians and the Apulians (from the toe of Italy) allied with Rome.Livy, viii, 8.22‚Äì23, 8.25‚Äì26 News of an alliance between the Samnites and the Vestini (Sabellians who lived by the Adriatic coast, to the north-east of Samnium) reached Rome. In 325 BC the consul Decimus Junius Brutus Scaeva ravaged their territory, forced them into a pitched battle and took the towns of Cutina and Cingilia.Livy, viii, 8.29 The dictator Lucius Papirius Cursor, who had taken over the command of the other consul, who had fallen ill, inflicted a crushing defeat on the Samnites in an unspecified location in 324 BC. The Samnites sued for peace and the dictator withdrew from Samnium. However, the Samnites rejected Rome's peace terms and agreed only a one-year truce, which they broke when they heard that Papirius intended to continue the fight. Livy also said that in that year the Apulians became enemies of Rome. Unfortunately, this information is very vague as the region of Apulia was populated by three separate ethnic groups, the Messapii in the south, the Iapyges in the centre and the Dauni in the north. We know that only Daunia (Land of the Dauni) was caught up in this war. However, this was a collection of independent city-states. Therefore, we do not know who in this area became enemies of Rome. The consuls for 323 BC fought on the two fronts, with C. Sulpicius Longus going to Samnium and Quintus Aemilius Cerretanus to Apulia. There were no battles, but areas were laid waste on both fronts.Livy, viii, 8.36‚Äì37 In 322 BC there were rumours that the Samnites had hired mercenaries and Aulus Cornelius Cossus Arvina was appointed as Dictator. The Samnites attacked his camp in Samnium, which he had to leave. A fierce battle followed and eventually the Samnites were routed. The Samnites offered to surrender, but this was rejected by Rome.Livy, viii, 8.38‚Äì39 =From the Caudine Forks to 316 BC= In 321 BC the consuls Titus Veturius Calvinus and Spurius Postumius Albinus were encamped in Calatia (a Campanian town 10 km southeast of Capua). Gaius Pontius, the commander of the Samnites, placed his army at the Caudine Forks and sent some soldiers disguised as shepherds grazing their flock towards Calatia. Their mission was to spread the misinformation that the Samnites were about to attack the city of Lucera in Apulia, which was an ally of Rome. The consuls decided to march to the aid of this city and to take the quicker (but less safe) route through the Caudine Forks. These were two narrow and wooded defiles on the Apennine Mountains with a plain between them. The passage from the first to the second defile was a narrow and difficult ravine. The Samnites blocked this with felled trees and boulders. When the Romans passed through, they also barraged the rear entry to the defile. The Romans were stuck and surrounded by the enemy and set up a fortified camp. Gaius Pontius sent a messenger to his father Herennius, a retired statesman, to ask for advice. His council was to free the Romans immediately. Gaius rejected this and Herenius‚Äô second message was to kill them all. With these contradictory responses Gaius thought that his father had gone senile, but summoned him to the Forks. Herennius said that the first option would lead to peace and friendship with Rome and that with the second one, the loss of two armies would neutralise the Romans for a long time. When asked about a middle course of letting them go and imposing terms on Rome, he said that this \\"neither wins men friends nor rids them of their enemies.\\" Shaming the Romans would lead them to seek revenge. Gaius decided to demand the Romans to surrender, \\"evacuate the Samnite territory and withdraw their colonies.\\" The consuls had no choice but to surrender. The Roman soldiers came out of their camp unarmed, underwent the humiliation of passing under the yoke and suffered the mockery of the enemy.Livy, viii, 9.2‚Äì6 The yoke was a symbol of subjugation in which the defeated soldiers had to bow and pass under a yoke used for oxen in disgrace. According to Appian, Pontius used spears as a yoke: \\"Pontius opened a passage from the defile, and having fixed two spears in the ground and laid another across the top, caused the Romans to go under it as they passed out, one by one.\\"Appian, History of Rome: The Samnite Wars, 1.10 Livy and other ancient sources maintain that Rome rejected the truce offered by the Samnites and avenged the humiliation with victories. Livy said that there was a two-year truce following victories in 320‚Äì319 BC.Livy, viii, 9.20 However, Salmon thinks that, instead, the truce was the result of the agreement which was made at the Caudine Forks.Salmon, viii. p. 226 Whatever the case, there was a truce which ended in 316 BC. For a discussion on this debate, see Frederiksen.Frederiksen, JRS 58 (1968) This section will continue to follow Livy's account. Livy wrote that regarding the demands of the Samnites (which in Rome they called the Caudine peace), the consuls said that they were in no position to agree a treaty because this had to be authorised by the vote of the people of Rome and ratified by the fetials (priest- ambassadors) following the proper religious rites. Therefore, instead of a treaty there was a guarantee, the guarantors being the consuls, the officers of the two armies and the quaestors. Six hundred equites (equestrians) were handed over as hostages \\"whose lives were to be forfeit if the Romans should fail to keep the terms.\\" Livy, viii, 9.5 The dejected Roman soldiers left and were too ashamed to enter Capua, whose inhabitants gave them supplies in commiseration. In Rome people went into mourning, shops were closed and all activities at the Forum were suspended. There was anger towards the soldiers and suggestions to bar them. However, when they arrived people took pity on them. They locked themselves in their homes.Livy, viii, 9.6‚Äì7 Spurius Postumius said to the senate that Rome was not bound to the guarantee at the Caudine Forks because it was given without the authorisation of the people, that there was no impediment to resuming the war and all that Rome owed to the Samnites were the persons and the lives of the guarantors. An army, the fetials and the guarantors to be surrendered were sent to Samnium. Once there, Postumius jostled the knee of a fetial and claimed that he was a Samnite who had violated diplomatic rules. Gaius Pontius denounced Roman duplicity and declared that he deemed the Roman guarantors not to be surrendered. The peace he had hoped for did not materialise. Meanwhile, Satricum (a town in Latium) defected to the Samnites and the Samnites took Fregellae.Livy, viii, 9.8‚Äì12 In 320 BC the consul Quintus Publilius Philo and Lucius Papirius Cursor marched to Apulia. This move threw the Samnites off. Publilius headed for Luceria, where the Roman hostages were held. He routed a Samnite contingent. However, the Samnites regrouped and besieged the Romans outside Luceria. The army of Papirius advanced along the coast as far as Arpi. The people of that area were well disposed towards the Romans because they were fed up with years of Samnite raids. They supplied the besieged Romans with corn. This forced the Samnites to engage Papirius. There was an indecisive battle and Papirius besieged the Samnites who then surrendered and passed under the yoke. Luceria was taken and the Roman hostages were freed.Livy, viii, 9.12‚Äì15 In 319 BC the consul Quintus Aemilius Barbula seized Ferentium and Quintus Publilius subdued Satricum, which had rebelled and had hosted a Samnite garrison. In 318 BC envoys from Samnite cities went to Rome to \\"seek a renewal of the treaty.\\" This was turned down, but a two-year truce was granted. The Apulian cities of Teanum and Canusium submitted to Rome and Apulia was now subdued. In 317 BC Quintus Aemilius Barbula took Nerulum in Lucania.Livy, viii, 9.20 =Presumed resumption of hostilities=316‚Äì313 BC ‚Äì Operations at Saticula, Sora, and Bovianum In 316 BC the dictator Lucius Aemilius besieged Saticula, a Samnite city near the border with Campania. A large Samnite army encamped near the Romans and the Saticulans made a sortie. Aemilius was in a position which was difficult to attack, drove the Saticulans back into the town and then confronted the Samnites, who fled to their camp and left at night. The Samnites then besieged the nearby Plistica, which was an ally of Rome.Livy, viii, 9.21 In 315 BC the dictator Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus took over the operations at Saticula. The Samnites had raised fresh troops, encamped near the city and were trying to force a battle to divert the Romans from the siege. Quintus Fabius concentrated on the city and the Samnites harassed the Roman rampart. The Roman master of the horse Quintus Aulius Cerretanus attacked the Samnites who were harassing the Roman Camp. He killed the Samnite commander and was killed himself. The Samnites left and went on to seize Plistica. The Romans transferred their troops in Apulia and Samnium to deal with Sora, a Roman colony in Latium near the border with Samnium, which had defected to the Samnites and killed the Roman colonists. The Roman army headed for there, but heard that the Samnites were also moving and that they were getting close. The Romans took a diversion and engaged the Samnites at the battle of Lautulae, where they were defeated and their master of the horse, Quintus Aulius, died. He was replaced by Gaius Fabius, who brought a new army and was told to conceal it. Quintus Fabius ordered battle without telling his troops about the new army and simulated a burning of their camp to strengthen their resolve. The soldiers threw the enemy into disarray and Quintus Aulius joined the attack.Livy, 9.22‚Äì23 In 314 BC the new consuls, Marcus Poetelius and Gaius Sulpicius, took new troops to Sora. The city was in a difficult position to take, but a deserter offered to betray it. He told the Romans to move their camp close to the city and the next night he took ten men on an almost impassable and steep path up to the citadel. He then shouted that the Romans had taken it. The inhabitants panicked and opened the city gates. The conspirators were taken to Rome and executed and a garrison was stationed at Sora. After the Samnite victory at Lautulae three Ausoni cities, Ausona, Minturnae (Ausonia and Minturno) both in Latium, just north of and on the north bank of the river Liris respectively, and Vescia (across the river, in Campania) had sided with the Samnites. Some young nobles from the three cities betrayed them and three Roman detachments were sent. Livy said that \\"because the leaders were not present when the attack was made, there was no limit to the slaughter, and the Ausonian nation was wiped out.\\" In the same year, Luceria betrayed its Roman garrison to the Samnites. A Roman army which was not far away seized the city. In Rome it was proposed to send 2500 colonists to Luceria. Many voted to destroy the city because of the treachery and, because it was so distant, that many believed that sending colonists there was like sending people into exile, and in hostile territory to boot. However, the colonization proposal was carried. A conspiracy was discovered in Capua and the Samnites decided to try to seize the city. They were confronted by both consuls, Marcus Poetelius Libo and Gaius Sulpicius Longus. The right wing of Poetelius routed its Samnite counterpart. However, Sulpicius, overconfident about a Roman victory, had left his left wing with a contingent to join Poetelius and without him his troops came close to defeat. When he re-joined them, his men prevailed. The Samnites fled to Maleventum, in Samnium.Livy, viii, 9.24‚Äì27 The two consuls went on to besiege Bovianum, the capital of the Pentri, the largest of the four Samnite tribes, and wintered there. In 313 BC they were replaced by the dictator Gaius Poetelius Libo Visolus. The Samnites took Fregellae and Poetelius moved to retake it, but the Samnites had left at night. He placed a garrison and then marched on Nola (near Naples) to retake it. He set fire to the buildings near the city walls and took the city. Colonies were established at the Volscian island of Pontiae, the Volscian town of Interamna Sucasina and at Suessa Aurunca. 312‚Äì308 BC ‚Äì The Etruscans intervene In 312 BC, while the war in Samnium seemed to be winding down, there were rumours of a mobilisation of the Etruscans, who were more feared than the Samnites. While the consul M. Valerius Maximus Corvus was in Samnium, his colleague Publius Decius Mus, who was sick, appointed Gaius Sulpicius Longus as dictator, who made preparations for war.Livy, viii, 9.29 In 311 BC the consuls Gaius Junius Bubulcus and Quintus Aemilius Barbula divided their command. Junius took on Samnium and Aemilius took on Etruria. The Samnites took the Roman garrison of Cluviae (location unknown) and scourged its prisoners. Junius retook it and then moved on Bovianum and sacked it. The Samnites sought to ambush the Romans. Misinformation that there was a large flock of sheep in an inaccessible mountain meadow was planted. Junius headed for it and was ambushed. While the Romans mounted the slope there was little fighting and when they reached level ground at the top and lined up the Samnites panicked and fled. The woods blocked their escape and most were killed. Meanwhile, the Etruscans besieged Sutrium, an ally which the Romans saw as their key to Etruria. Aemilius came to help and the next day the Etruscans offered battle. It was a long and bloody fight. The Romans were starting to gain the upper hand, but darkness stopped the battle. There was no further fighting that year as the Etruscans had lost their first line and only had their reservists left and the Romans had suffered many casualties.Livy, viii, 9.31‚Äì32 In 310 BC the consul Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus went to Sutrium with reinforcements and was met by a superior force of Etruscans who were lined up for battle. He went up the hills and faced the enemy. The Etruscans charged in haste, throwing away their javelins. The Romans pelted them with javelins and stones. This unsettled the Etruscans and their line wavered. The Romans charged, the Etruscans fled and, as they were cut off by the Roman cavalry, they headed for the mountains instead of their camp. From there they went to the impassable Ciminian Forest, which the Romans were so scared of that none of them had ever crossed it. Marcus Fabius, one of the brothers of the consul, who had been educated by family friends in Caere in Etruria and spoke Etruscan, offered to explore the forest, pretending to be an Etruscan shepherd. He went as far as Camerinum in Umbria, where the locals offered supplies and soldiers to the Romans. Quintus Fabius crossed the forest and ravaged the area around the Cimian Mountains. This enraged the Etruscans, who gathered the largest army they had ever raised and marched on Sutrium. They advanced to the Roman rampart, but the Romans refused to engage, so they waited there. To encourage his outnumbered soldiers Quintus Fabius told them that he had a secret weapon and hinted that the Etruscans were being betrayed. At dawn the Romans exited their camp and attacked the sleeping Etruscans, who were routed. Some fled to their camp, but most made for the hills and the forest. The Etruscan cities of Perusia and Cortona and Arretium sued for peace and obtained a thirty-year truce.Livy, 9.33‚Äì37 Meanwhile, the other consul, Gaius Marcius Rutilus, captured Allifae (in Campania) from the Samnites and destroyed or seized many forts and villages. The Roman fleet was sent to Pompeii in Campania and from there they pillaged the territory of Nuceria. Greedy for booty, the sailors ventured too far inland and on their way back the country folk killed many of them. The Samnites received a report that the Romans had been besieged by the Etruscans and had decided to confront Gaius Marcius. The report also indicated that, if Gaius Marcius avoided battle, the Samnites would march to Etruria via the lands of the Marsi and the Sabines. Gaius Marcius confronted them and a bloody but indecisive battle was fought where the Romans lost several officers and the consul was wounded. The senate appointed Lucius Papirius Cursor as dictator. However, Quintus Fabius had a grudge against Lucius Papirius. A delegation of former consuls was sent to him to persuade him to accept the Senate's decision, and Fabius reluctantly appointed Papirius. Lucius Papirius relieved Gaius Marcius at Longula, a Volscian town near the Samnite border. He marched out to offer battle. The two armies lined up in front of each other until night and there was no fighting. Meanwhile, a fierce battle was fought in Etruria by an unspecified Etruscan army levied (presumably by Etruscans who had not signed the mentioned treaty) by using the lex sacrata (an arrangement with religious connotations whereby the soldiers had to fight to the death). It confronted the Romans at the Battle of Lake Vadimo. The battle was long-drawn-out affair and with many casualties and the reserves were called in. It was finally resolved by the Roman cavalry which dismounted and fought like a fresh line of infantry and managed to break the exhausted ranks of the enemy. Livy said that this battle broke the might of the Etruscans for the first time as the battle cut off their strength.Livy, 9.38‚Äì39 In 309 BC Lucius Papirius Cursor won a massive battle against the Samnites and celebrated the finest triumph there had been thanks to the spoils. The Etruscan cities broke the truce and Quintus Fabius easily defeated the remnants of their troops near Perusia and would have taken the city had it not surrendered. In 308 BC, Quintus Fabius was elected consul again. His colleague was Publius Decius Mus. Quintus Fabius took on Samnium. He refused peace offers by Nuceria Alfaterna and besieged it into surrender. He also fought an unspecified battle where the Marsi joined the Samnites. The Paeligni, who also sided with the Samnites, were defeated next. In Etruria Decius obtained a forty-year truce and corn supplies from Tarquinii, seized some strongholds of Volsinii and ravaged wide areas. All Etruscans sued for a treaty, but he conceded only a one-year truce and required them to give each Roman soldier one year's pay and two tunics. There was a revolt by Umbrians who, backed by Etruscan men, gathered a large army and said that they would ignore Decius and march on Rome. Decius undertook forced marches, encamped near Pupinia, to the north-east of Rome, and called on Fabius to lead his army to Umbria. Fabius marched to Mevania, near Assisi, where the Umbrian troops were. The Umbrians were surprised as they thought he was in Samnium. Some of them fell back to their cities and some pulled out of the war. Others attacked Fabius while he was entrenching his camp, but they were defeated. The leaders of the revolt surrendered and the rest of Umbria capitulated within days.Livy, viii, 9.40‚Äì41 307‚Äì304 BC ‚Äì Final campaigns in Apulia and Samnium In 307 BC the consul Lucius Volumnius Flamma Violens was assigned a campaign against the Salentini of southern Apulia, where he seized several hostile towns. Quintus Fabius was elected as proconsul to conduct the campaign in Samnium. He defeated the Samnites in a pitched battle near Allifae and besieged their camp. The Samnites surrendered, passed under the yoke and their allies were sold into slavery. There were some Hernici among the troops and they were sent to Rome where an inquiry was held to determine whether they were conscripts or volunteers. All of the Hernici, except the peoples of the cities of Aletrium, Ferentium and Verulae, declared war on Rome. Quintus Fabius left Samnium, and the Samnites seized Calatia and Sora with their Roman garrisons. In 306 BC the consul Publius Cornelius Arvina headed for Samnium and his colleague Quintus Marcius Tremulus took on the Hernici. The enemies took all the strategic points between the camps and isolated the two consuls. In Rome two armies were enlisted. However, the Hernici did not engage the Romans, lost three camps, sued for a thirty-year truce and then surrendered unconditionally. Meanwhile, the Samnites were harassing Publius Cornelius and blocking his supply routes. Quintus Marcius came to his aid and was attacked. He advanced through the enemy lines and took their camp, which was empty, and burned it. On seeing the fire Publius Cornelius joined in and blocked the escape of the Samnites, who were slaughtered when the two consuls joined their forces. Some Samnite relief troops also attacked, but they were routed and pursued and begged for peace. In 305 BC the Samnites made forays in Campania.Livy, viii, 9.42‚Äì43 In 305 BC the consuls were sent to Samnium. Lucius Postumius Megellus marched on Tifernum and Titus Minucius Augurinus on Bovianum. There was a battle at Tifernum where some of Livy's sources say that Postumius was defeated, while others say that the battle was even and he withdrew to the mountains at night. The Samnites followed him and encamped near him. Livy said that he seemed to have wanted to gain a position where he could get abundant supplies. Postumius then left a garrison at this camp and marched to his colleague who was also encamped facing the enemy. He instigated Titus Minucius to give battle, which dragged on until the late afternoon. Then Postumius joined in and the Samnites were slaughtered. The next day the consuls begun the siege of Bovianum, which fell quickly. In 304 BC the Samnites sent envoys to Rome to negotiate a peace. The suspicious Romans sent the consul Publius Sempronius Sophus to Samnium with an army to investigate the true intentions of the Samnites. He travelled all over Samnium and everywhere he found peaceable people who gave him supplies. Livy said that the ancient treaty with the Samnites was restored. He did not specify what the terms were.Livy, viii, 9.43‚Äì44 =Aftermath= After the defeat of the Hernici in 306 BC, Roman citizenship without the right to vote was imposed on this people, effectively annexing their territory. In 304 BC, after the peace treaty, Rome sent the fetials to ask for reparation from the Aequi of the mountains by Latium, who had repeatedly joined the Hernici in helping the Samnites and after the defeat of the former, they went over to the enemy. The Aequi claimed that Rome was trying to impose Roman citizenship on them. They said to the Roman assemblies that the thrusting of Roman citizenship on them amounted to loss of independence and was a punishment. This led to the Roman people voting for war on the Aequi. Both consuls were entrusted with this war. The Aequi levied a militia, but this did not have a clear commander. There was disagreement over whether to offer battle or defend their camp. Concerns about the destruction of the farms and the poor fortification of the towns led to the decision to disperse to defend the towns. The Romans found the Aequi camp deserted. They then took the Aequi towns by storm and most were burnt. Livy wrote that \\"the Aequian name was almost blotted out.\\" Livy, viii, 10.1 Still, in 304 BC, the Sabellian peoples of modern northern Abruzzo, the Marsi and Marucini (on the Adriatic coast), as well as the latter's Oscan neighbours, the Paeligni and the Frentani (Oscans who lived in the southern coast of Abruzzo and the coastal part of modern Molise), stipulated treaties with Rome.Livy, viii, 9.45 In 303 BC the Sabine town of Trefula Suffrenas (Ciciliano) and the Volscian town of Arpinium (Arpino) in southern Latium were given citizenship without the right to vote (civitas sine suffragio). Frusino (Frosinone), also a Volscian town in southern Latium, was deprived of two thirds of its land because it had conspired with the Hernici and its ringleaders were executed. Colonies were established at Alba Fucens in the land of the Aequi and Sora, in Volscian territory which had been taken by the Samnites, with 6000 settlers sent to the former and 4000 to the latter. In 302 BC the Aequi attacked Alba Fucens, but were defeated by the colonists. Gaius Junius Bubulcus was appointed as dictator. He reduced them to submission in one battle. In the same year the Vestini (Oscans who lived on Adriatic coast of modern Abruzzo) established an alliance with Rome. In 301 BC the Marsi resisted land being confiscated for the establishment of the colony of Carsoli (or Carseoli, modern Carsoli) with 4000 colonists, even through it was in Aequi territory. Marcus Valerius Corvus Calenus was appointed as dictator. He defeated the Marsi, seized Milionia, Plestina, and Fresilia and renewed the treaty with them. In 300 BC two Roman tribes (administrative districts), the Aniensis and the Terentina were added. In 299 BC the Romans besieged and seized Nequinum in Umbria and established the colony of Narnia.Livy, viii, 10.1, 3, 9, 10 The annexation of Trebula Suffenas provided a degree of control over the Sabines who lived close to Rome. With the annexation of Arpinium and of the most of the land of Frusino and the founding of the colony at Sora the Romans consolidated control over southern Latium and the Volsci. Control over the stretch of the Apennine Mountains next to Latium was consolidated with the annexation of the Hernici, the destruction of the towns of the Aequi, the founding of two colonies in their territory (Alba Fucens and Caseoli) and the creation of the Aniensis Roman tribe on land taken from the Aequi. Control over Campania was consolidated with the renewal of friendship with Naples, with the destruction of the Ausoni, and the creation of the Teretina Roman tribe on land which had been annexed by from the Aurunci in 314 BC.Cornell, T., J, The Beginnings of Rome, pp. 357‚Äì58 The alliances with the Marsi, Maruccini, Paelingni, Frentani (in 304 BC), and Vestini (in 302 BC), who lived to the north and north-east of Samnium, not only gave Rome control over this substantial area around Samnium, but it also strengthened its military position. The alliances were military and the allies supplied soldiers who supported the Roman legions at their own expense, thus increasing the pool of military manpower available to Rome. In exchange the allies shared the spoils of war (which could be considerable) and were protected by Rome. However, Rome's dominance over central Italy and part of southern Italy was not fully established yet. Etruria and Umbria were not quite pacified. There were two expeditions to Umbria; there were wars with the Etruscans in 301 BC and in 298 BC. The latter was the year the Third Samnite War broke out.Livy, viii, 10.3‚Äì5, 10 The second war accelerated the process of Roman expansion and the third war established Rome's dominance of the areas concerned. Third Samnite War (298 to 290 BC) A ceremonial Attic helmet typical of many found in Samnite tombs, c. 300 BC =Outbreak= In 299 BC, the Etruscans, possibly due to the Roman colony set up at Narnia in next-door Umbria, prepared for war against Rome. However, the Gauls invaded their territory, so, the Etruscans offered them money to form an alliance. The Gauls agreed, but then objected to fighting against Rome, claiming that the agreement was only about them not devastating Etruscan territory. So, instead, the Etruscans paid the Gauls off and dismissed them. This incident led the Romans to ally with the Picentes (who lived on the Adriatic coast, in the south of modern Marche) who were concerned about their neighbours, the Senone Gauls to the north, and the Pretutii to the south. The latter had allied with the Samnites. The Romans sent an army to Etruria led by the consul Titus Manlius Torquatus, who died in a riding accident. The Etruscans saw this as an omen for war. However, the Romans elected Marcus Valerius Corvus Calenus as suffect consul (an office which lasted for the remainder of the term of a deceased or removed consul) and he was sent to Etruria. This led the Etruscans to remain in their fortifications, refusing battle even though the Romans ravaged their land. Meanwhile, the Picentes warned the Romans that the Samnites were preparing for war and that they had asked them for help.Livy, X.10 Early in 298 BC a Lucanian delegation went to Rome to ask the Romans to take them under their protection as the Samnites, having failed to bring them into an alliance, had invaded their territory. Rome agreed to an alliance. Fetials were sent to Samnium to order the Samnites to leave Lucania. The Samnites threatened their safety and Rome declared war.Livy, X.11Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Excerpts from Books, xvii/xviii.1‚Äì2 Dionysius of Halicarnassus thought that the cause of the war was not Roman compassion for the wronged, but fear of the strength the Samnites would gain if they subdued the Lucanians.Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Excerpts from Books xvii/xviii.3 Oakley suggests that Rome might well have deliberately sought a new war with Samnium by allying with her enemies.Oakley, 2008, p. 168 =The war=298 BC: Conflicting Accounts According to Livy, the consul Lucius Cornelius Scipio Barbatus was assigned Etruria and his colleague Gnaeus Fulvius Maximus Centumalus was given the Samnites. Barbatus was engaged in a battle near Volterrae (in northern Etruria) which was interrupted by sunset. The Etruscans retreated during the night. Barbatus marched to the Faliscan district and laid Etruscan territory north of the River Tiber to waste. Gnaeus Fulvius won in Samnium and seized Bovianum, and Aufidena. However, an epitaph on the sarcophagus of Cornelius Scipio says that he ‚Äòwas consul, censor and aedile ...[and]... He captured Taurasia and Cisauna in Samnium; he subdued all Lucania and brought back hostages.‚Äô Cornell says that the original inscription was erased and replaced by the extant one probably around 200 BC, and notes that this \\"was the period when the first histories of Rome were being written, which is not a coincidence.\\".Cornell, 1995, p. 360 and 466, note 35 In addition to having Barbatus fighting in Samnium the inscription records him as taking Taurasia (probably in the Tammaro valley in the modern province of Benevento) and Cisauna (unknown location), rather than Bovianum and Aufidena.Oakley, 2008, p. 164 There is the further complication by the Fasti Triumphales (a record of Roman triumphal celebrations), recording Gnaeus Fulvius‚Äô triumphs against both the Samnites and the Etruscans.Oakley, 2008, p. 171 Forsythe points out that the consulship is the only public office Barbatus is mentioned as having held which gave him command of a legion.Forsythe, 2008, p. 328 Modern historians have proposed various alternative scenarios wherein one or both of the consuls campaigned against both the Samnites and Etruscans, but without satisfactory conclusions.Oakley, 2008, pp. 173‚Äì74 Cornell says that such an assumption could reconcile the sources, but \\"if so, neither Livy nor the inscription would emerge with much credit. Once again the evidence seems to show that there was a great deal of confusion in the tradition about the distribution of consular commands in the Samnite Wars, and that many different versions proliferated in the Late Republic.\\" His conclusion is that \\"no satisfactory resolution to this puzzle is possible\\" Cornell, 1995, p. 360 Regarding the submission of Lucania and the bringing back of hostages, Livy said that the Lucanians were willing to give hostages as a pledge of good faith.Livy, X.11 Cornell remarks that \\"[t]he intimation of that the Lucanians‚Äô submission was the result of military action is a good example of how events could be improved in the telling.\\" Forsythe points out that Livy noted that in 296 BC the Romans suppressed plebeian disturbances in Lucania on the behest of the Lucanian aristocracy. He argues that this suggests divisions in Lucania over the alliance with Rome and that, if this was also the case in 298 BC, Barbatus might have gone to Lucania to quell any possible local resistance to the alliance as well as to prevent Samnite raids and to collect the agreed hostages. Forsythe also notes that Barbatus‚Äô campaign in Etruria could be explained in three ways: 1) it could be fictive; 2) Barbatus could have campaigned in both Samnium and Etruria; 3) Barbatus participated in the campaigns linked to the front which led to the Battle of Sentinum in 295 BC, and that this may have included operations in Etruria in that year, but it might have been attributed by later historians to his consulship in 298 BC. As for the claim that Barbatus subdued all of Lucania, Forsythe suggests that this is \\"perhaps part truth and part a Roman aristocratic exaggeration.\\"Forsythe, 2006, pp. 328‚Äì29 Oakley also points to two more problems with the sources. In Livy's account, Bovianum, the capital of the Pentri, the largest of the four Samnite tribes, was captured in the first year of the war, which seems unlikely. Frontinus records three stratagems employed by one \\"Fulvius Nobilior\\" while fighting against the Samnites in Lucania.Frontinus, I.6.1‚Äì2 & 11.2 The cognomen Nobilior is not otherwise recorded before 255 BC, forty-five years after the end of the Samnite Wars. A plausible explanation is therefore that Nobilior is a mistake and the stratagems should be attributed to the consul of 298 BC.Oakley, 2008, p. 172 297 BC: Rome turns to Samnium The elections of the consuls for 297 BC took place amid rumours that the Etruscans and the Samnites were raising huge armies. The Romans turned to Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus, Rome's most experienced military commander, who was not a candidate for election and refused the proposal. He then relented on condition that Publius Decius Mus, who had been consul with him in 308 BC, would be elected as his colleague.Livy, X.13.2‚Äì13 It is impossible to establish whether Livy had any evidence for the existence of these rumours, or if they are just conjecture by him or his sources. Livy is the only source for the events of 297 BC. He wrote that envoys from Sutrium, Nepete (Romans colonies) and Falerii in southern Etruria arrived in Rome with news that the Etruscan city-states were discussing suing for peace. This freed both consuls, who marched on Samnium, Quintus Fabius by way of Sora and Publius Decius through the land of the Sidicini. A Samnite army had prepared to confront them in a valley near Tifernum, but it was defeated by Quintus Fabius. Meanwhile, Publius Decius had camped at Maleventum where an Apulian army would have joined the Samnites in the battle against Quintus Fabius had Publius Decius not defeated it. The two consuls then spent four months ravaging Samnium. Fabius also seized Cimetra (location unknown).Livy, X.14.1‚Äì15.6 There are no major problems with Livy's account, but no parallel sources survive to confirm it either. Fabius' route via Sora to Tifernum is convoluted, but not insurmountable. The appearance of an Apulian army at Maleventum is surprising since nothing is known of Apulian hostility to Rome since the conclusion of peace in 312 BC. However the Apulians might have been divided in their alliance with Rome or have been provoked to war by the campaign of Barbatus the previous year. Publius Decius' campaign fits within the larger pattern of Roman warfare in south-eastern Italy; he might even have wintered in Apulia. No triumphs are recorded in this year for either of the consuls, hence they are unlikely to have had any victories of great significance or made any deep inroads into Samnium. 296 BC: Etruscan intervention The consuls for 296 BC were Appius Claudius Caecus and Lucius Volumnius Flamma Violens. The previous consuls were given a six-month extension of their command as proconsuls to carry on the war in Samnium. Publius Decius ravaged Samnium until he drove the Samnite army outside its territory. This army went to Etruria to back up previous calls for an alliance, which had been turned down, with intimidation and insisted on the Etruscan council being convened. The Samnites pointed out that they could not defeat Rome by themselves, but an army of all the Etruscans, the richest nation in Italy, backed up by the Samnite army could. Meanwhile, Publius Decius decided to switch from ravaging the countryside to attacking cities as the Samnite army was away. He seized Murgantia, a strong city, and Romulea. After that he marched to Ferentium, which was in southern Etruria. Livy pointed out some discrepancies between his sources, noting that some annalists said that Romulea and Ferentium were taken by Quintus Fabius and that Publius Decius took only Murgantia, while others said that the towns were taken by the consuls of the year, and others still gave all the credit to Lucius Volumnius who, they said, had sole command in Samnium.Livy, 10. 16.1‚Äì2, 17 Meanwhile, in Etruria Gellius Egnatius, a Samnite commander, was organising a campaign against Rome. Almost all the Etruscan city-states voted for war, the nearest Umbrian tribes joined in and there were attempts to hire Gauls as auxiliaries. News of this reached Rome and Appius Claudius set off for Etruria with two legions and 15,000 allied troops. Lucius Volumnius had already left for Samnium with two legions and 12,000 allies.Livy, 10.17 This is the first time Livy gives details about the Roman forces and figures for the allied troops for the Samnite wars. It is also the first time that we hear of the consuls commanding two legions each. Including the forces of the proconsuls, in this year the Romans must have mobilised six legions. Appius Claudius suffered a number of setbacks and lost the confidence of his troops. Lucius Volumnius, who had taken three fortifications in Samnium, sent Quintus Fabius to suppress disturbances by the plebeians in Lucania, left the ravaging of rural Samnium to Publius Decius and went to Etruria. Livy notes that some annalists said that Appius Claudius had written him a letter to summon him from Samnium and that this became a subject of dispute between the two consuls, with the former denying it and the latter insisting that he had been summoned by the former. Livy thought that Appius Claudius did not write the letter, but said that he wanted to send his colleague back to Samnium and felt that he ungratefully denied his need for help. However, the soldiers begged him to stay. A dispute between the two men ensued, but the soldiers insisted that both consuls fight in Etruria. The Etruscans faced Lucius Volumnius and the Samnites advanced on Appius Claudius. Livy said that \\"the enemy could not withstand a force so much greater than they were accustomed to meet.\\" They were routed; 7,900 were killed and 2,010 were captured.Livy, 10.18‚Äì19 Lucius Volumnius hurried back to Samnium because the proconsulships of Quintus Fabius and Publius Decius were about to expire. Meanwhile, the Samnites raised new troops and raided Roman territories and allies in Campania around Capua and Falernium. Lucius Volumnius headed for Campania and was informed that the Samnites had gone back to Samnium to take their loot. He caught up with their camp and defeated a force which was made unfit to fight by the burden of their loot. The Samnite commander, Staius Minatius, was attacked by the prisoners of the Samnites and delivered to the consul. The senate decided to establish the colonies of Minturnae on the mouth of the River Liris and Sinuessa further inland, in the former territory of the Ausoni.Livy, 10.20‚Äì21 295 BC: The Etrurian Campaign and the Battle of Sentinum The Samnite raids in Campania created great alarm in Rome. In addition to this, there was news that, following the withdrawal of Lucius Volumnius' army from Etruria, the Etruscans were arming themselves, had invited Gellius Egnatius' Samnites and the Umbrians to join them in revolt, and had offered large sums of money to the Gauls. Then there were reports of an actual coalition between these four peoples and that there was \\"a huge army of Gauls.\\" Livy, 10.21.1‚Äì2, 12‚Äì14 It was the first time that Rome had to confront a coalition of four peoples. There was going to be the biggest war Rome had ever faced and the two best military commanders, Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus and Publius Decius Mus were elected as consuls again (for 295 BC). Lucius Volumnius' command was prolonged for a year. Quintus Fabius went to Etruria with one legion to replace Appius Claudius and left this legion in Clusium, too. He then went to Rome where the war was being debated. It was decided that the two consuls both fight in Etruria. They set off with four legions, a large cavalry and 1,000 Campanian soldiers. The allies fielded an even larger army. Lucius Volumnius went to Samnium with two legions. That he went with such a large force must have been part of a diversionary strategy to force the Samnites to respond to Roman raids in Samnium and limit their troop deployment in Etruria. Two reserve contingents headed by propraetors were stationed in the Faliscan district and near the Vatican Hill respectively to protect Rome.Livy, Livy,10.22.2‚Äì5; 22.9; 25.4‚Äì12; 26.4,14‚Äì15 Livy reported two traditions about events in Etruria early in 295 BC. According to one, before the consuls went to Etruria, a large force of Senones went to Clusium to attack the Roman legion stationed there and routed it. There were no survivors to warn the consuls who were unaware of the disaster until they came across Gallic horsemen. According to the other one, Umbrians attacked a Roman foraging party which was relieved by assistance from the Roman camp.Livy, 26.5‚Äì14 The Etruscans, Samnites and Umbrians crossed the Apennine Mountains and advanced near Sentinum (in the Marche region, near modern Sassoferrato). Their plan was for the Samnites and Senones to engage the Romans and for the Etruscans and Umbrians to take the Roman camp during the battle. Deserters from Clusium informed Quintus Fabius about this plan. The consul ordered the legions in Falerii and the Vatican to march to Clusium and ravage its territory for another diversionary strategy. It drew the Etruscans away from Sentinium to defend their land. In the Battle of Sentinum, the Gauls stood on the right wing and the Samnites on the left. Quintus Fabius stood on the right and Publius Decius on the left. Livy said that the two forces were so evenly matched that if the Etruscans and Umbrians had been present it would have been a disaster for the Romans.Livy, 10.27 Quintus Fabius fought defensively to prolong the battle into a test of endurance and wait for the enemy to flag. Publius Decius fought more aggressively and ordered a cavalry attack, which drove back the Senone cavalry twice. The second time they reached the enemy infantry, but suffered a chariot attack and were scattered and overthrown. The line of the Decius‚Äô infantry was broken by the chariots and the Senone foot attacked. Publius Decius decided to devote himself. This term referred to a military commander offering prayers to the gods and launching himself into the enemy lines, effectively sacrificing himself, when his troops were in dire straits. This act galvanised the Roman left which was also joined by two reserve contingents which Quintus Fabius had called in to help. On the right, Quintus Fabius told the cavalry to outflank the Samnite wing and attack it in the flank and ordered his infantry to push forward. He then called in the other reserves. The Samnites fled past the Senone line. The Senones formed a testudo (tortoise) formation ‚Äì where the men aligned their shields in a compact formation covered with shields at the front and top. Quintus Fabius ordered 500 Campanian lancers to attack them at the rear. This was to be combined with push by the middle line of one of the legions and an attack by the cavalry. Meanwhile, Quintus Fabius took the Samnite camp by storm and cut off the Senones in the rear. The Senone Gauls were defeated. The Romans lost 8,700 men and their enemy 20,000.Livy, 10.28‚Äì29 Livy noted that some writers (whose works are lost) exaggerated the size of the battle, saying that the Umbrians also took part and gave the enemy an infantry of 60,000 a cavalry of 40,000 and 1,000 chariots and claiming that Lucius Volumnius and his two legions also fought in the battle. Livy said that Lucius Volumnius, instead, was holding the front in Samnium and routed a Samnite force near Mount Tifernus. After the battle, 5,000 Samnites made their way back home from Sentinum through the land of the Paeligni. The locals attacked them and killed 1,000 men. In Etruria, the propraetor Gnaeus Fulvius defeated the Etruscans. Perusia and Clusium lost up to 3,000 men. Quintus Fabius left Publius Decius‚Äô army to guard Etruria and went to Rome to celebrate a triumph. In Etruria Perusia continued the war. Appius Claudius was sent to head Publius Decius's army as propraetor and Quintus Fabius confronted and defeated the Perusini. The Samnites attacked the areas around the River Liris (at Formiae and Vescia), and the River Volturnus. They were pursued by Appius Claudius and Lucius Volumnius, who merged their forces and defeated the Samnites in the vicinity of Caiatia, near Capua.Livy, 10.30‚Äì31 294 BC: Samnite Raids In 294 BC the Samnites raided three Roman armies (one was meant to return to Etruria, one to defend the border and the third to raid Campania). The consul Marcus Atilius Regulus was sent to the front and met the Samnites in a position where neither force could raid enemy territory. The Samnites attacked the Roman camp under the cover of fog, taking part of the camp and killing many men and several officers. The Romans managed to repel them but did not pursue them because of the fog. The other consul, Lucius Postumius Megellus, who was recovering from illness, assembled an army of allies at Sora, where Roman foragers had been pushed back by the Samnites, and the Samnites retreated. Lucius Postumius went on to take Milionia and Feritrum, two unidentified Samnite towns.Livy, 10.33‚Äì34 Marcus Atilius marched on Luceria (in Apulia), which was being besieged, and was defeated. The next day there was another battle. The Roman infantry began to flee, but was forced back into battle by their cavalry. The Samnites did not press their advantage and were then defeated. On his way back, Marcus Atilius defeated a Samnite force which was trying to seize Interamna, a Roman colony on the River Liris. The other consul, Lucius Postumius, moved from Samnium to Etruria without consulting the senate. He ravaged the territory of Volsinii and defeated the townsfolk who had come out of the city to defend it. Volsinii, Perusia and Arretium sued for peace and obtained a forty-year truce. Livy mentioned that there were sources with different stories. In one, it was Marcus Atilius who went to Etruria and got a triumph. Lucius Postumius, instead, seized some cities in Samnium and then was defeated and wounded in Apulia and took refuge in Luceria. In another, both consuls fought in Samnium and at Luceria, with both sides suffering heavy losses.Livy, 10-35-37 293 BC-290 BC: Defeat of Samnium In 293 BC, fresh troops were levied throughout Samnium. Forty thousand men met in Aquilonia. The consul Spurius Carvilius Maximus took on veteran legions which Marcus Atilius had left at Interamna Lirenas in the middle Liris valley and went on to seize Amiternum in Samnium (not to be confused with Amiternum in Sabina). The other consul, Lucius Papirius Cursor (the son of the Lucius Papirius of the Second Samnite War), levied a new army and took Duronia by storm. The two consuls then went where the main Samnite forces were stationed. Spurius Carvilius went to Cominium and engaged in skirmishes. Lucius Papirius besieged Aquilonia. Both towns were in north- western Samnium. The consuls decided to attack both at the same time. Lucius Papirius was informed by a deserter that twenty contingents of 400 men each of the Samnite elite forces which, in desperation, had been recruited under the lex sacrata (in which soldiers swore not to flee the battle under pain of death) were heading for Cominium. He informed his colleague and then set out to intercept them with part of his forces, defeating them. Meanwhile, the other part of his forces attacked Aquilonia. Lucius Pairius re-joined them and the city was taken. Meanwhile, at Cominium, when Spurius Carvilius heard about the twenty elite Samnite contingents (not knowing about their defeat by his colleague), he sent a legion and some auxiliaries to keep them at bay and went ahead with his planned attack on the city, which eventually surrendered.Livy, 10.39‚Äì44 Forsythe writes that the Battle of Aquilonia \\"was the last great battle of the war, and it sealed the fate of the Samnites.\\" Forsythe, 2006, p.334 With the Samnite armies destroyed, the consuls decided to storm towns. Spurius Carvilius took Velia, Palumbinum and Herculaneum (locations unknown). Lucius Papirius took Saepinum (modern Altilia), one of Samnium's main towns. Meanwhile, the Etruscans attacked Roman allies and the Faliscans defected to the Etruscans. With the winter setting in and the snow falling, the Romans withdrew from Samnium. Lucius Papirius went to Rome for his triumph and then went to Vescia (in Campania) to winter and to protect the locals from Samnite raids. Spurius Carvilius went to Etruria. He seized Troilum (location unknown) and took five fortresses by storm. The Faliscans sued for peace and were fined heavily and granted a one-year truce.Livy, 10.45‚Äì46 Livy's narrative of the Third Samnite War ends here, with the end of Book 10. Books 11‚Äì20 have been lost. For Book 11 we only have a brief summary which is part of the Periochae, a summary of his 142 books (except for 136 and 137). There is mention of the consul Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges being defeated in Samnium and being spared a recall from the army and humiliation by the intervention of his father, Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus, who promised to help him as deputy. The two men defeated the Samnites and captured Gaius Pontius, the Samnite commander, who was paraded in the triumph and beheaded. Gurges had moved against the Caudini and according to Eutropius his army was nearly destroyed and lost 3,000 men.Eutropius, Abridgment of Roman History, 2.9.3 Salmon thinks that this setback was probably an exaggeration because the next year Gurges was appointed proconsul and he was consul again in 276 BC, during the Pyrrhic War. He thinks that his subsequent victory was also magnified and is a fictitious anticipation of the father and son partnership between Quintus Fabius Maximus Cunctator and his son during the Second Punic War Salmon, 1967, pp. 274‚Äì75 In 291 BC Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges, as proconsul, defeated the Pentri, the largest Samnite tribe, and took their stronghold of Cominium Ocritum. The consul Lucius Postimius Megellus operating form Apulia attacked the Hirpini tribe of the Samnites and seized their large town of Venusia. Because its location offered control over Lucania and Apulia as well as Samnium the Romans founded the largest colony they ever established. Dionysius of Halicarnassus gave a figure of 20,000 colonists, which is impossibly high.Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman antiquities, 17/18.4.5 Details for 290 BC are scant, but the little surviving information suggests that the consuls Manius Curius Dentatus and Publius Cornelius Rufinus campaigned to mop up the last pockets of resistance throughout Samnium and according to Eutropius this involved some large scale fighting.Eutropius, Abridgment of Roman History, 2.9.3Salmon, 1967, pp. 275‚Äì76 =Aftermath= When the Samnite War ended, the Romans moved to crush the Sabines who lived on the mountains to the east of Rome. Manius Curius Dentatus pushed deep into the Sabine territory between the rivers Nar (today's Nera, the main tributary of the River Tiber) and Anio (Aniene, another tributary of the Tiber) and the source of the River Avens (Velino). Spurius Carvilius confiscated large tracts of land in the plain around Reate (today's Rieti) and Amiternum (11 km from L‚Äô Aquila), which he distributed to Roman settlers.Florus, Epitome of Roman history, 1.10 Florus did not give the reasons for this campaign. Salmon speculates that \\"it might have been because of the part they had played or failed to play in the events of 296/295 [BC].\\" Salmon, Samnium and the Samnites, p. 376 They let the Samnites cross their territory to go to Etruria. Forsythe also speculated that it may have been a punishment for this.Forsythe, A Critical History of Early Rome, p. 334 Livy mentioned that Dentatus subdued the rebellious Sabines.Livy, Periochae, XI The Sabines were given citizenship without the right to vote (civitas sine suffragio), which meant that their territory was effectively annexed to the Roman Republic. Reate and Amiternum were given full Roman citizenship (civitas optimo iure) in 268 BC. Cornell notes that Rome also conquered the Praetutii.Cornell, THe Beginning of Rome, p. 362 They lived to the east of the Sabines, on the Adriatic coast and were at odds with the Picentes, who were Roman allies. With these two conquests the Roman territory extended into the Apennines area next to her and a strip of it stretched to the Adriatic Sea. This, combined with the mentioned alliances struck after the Second Samnite War with the Marsi, Marrucini, and Paeligni (304 BC) and the Vestini (302 BC), gave Rome control of this part of central Italy. The Samnites were forced to become allies of Rome which must have been on unequal terms. Rome offered a friendship treaty (foedus amicitiae) to those who allied with her voluntarily, but not to those who became allies as a result of defeat. The Romans also established a colony at Venusia, an important strategic point in south-eastern Samnium. The Lucanians retained their alliance with Rome. The result of the Samnite Wars was that Rome became the great power of Italy and controlled a large portion of it. The alliances which developed after the Latin war, after the Second Samnite War, and at the beginning and the end of the third war laid the foundation for Rome to become the great power in the Mediterranean which defeated Pyrrhus and the Carthaginians and expanded into the Eastern Mediterranean. All the alliance treaties provided that the allies had to provide troops for Rome's wars at their expense. The system worked because Rome supported the ruling elites of the allied peoples, who could turn to her in case of local troubles, and Rome shared the spoils of war, which could be considerable, with her allies. The allies also gained security, protection (Rome fought wars to defend their allies) and a share in the profits of conquest. The participation of allied troops had already become important in the Battle of Sentinum of the Second Samnite War. The Romans came to rely on the allies and their troops often greatly outnumbered those of the Romans.Cornell, The Beginnings of Rome, pp.264‚Äì68 Polybius wrote that for the massive battle of Telamon against the Gauls in 225 BC, the Romans deployed about 41,000 Roman troops and 210,000 allied troops. It can also be deduced that the pool of Roman military manpower was about 40% of the total Roman and Italian pool, which Polybius estimated at 700,000.Polybius, The Histories, 2.24 These were massive numbers which could not be matched by anyone else in the Mediterranean. In 283 BC there was further Roman consolidation in Italy. There were clashes with the Gauls and the Etruscans. The sources lack detail and can be confused. According to Polybius in 283 BC unspecified Gauls besieged Arretium and defeated a Roman force which had come to the aid of the city. The praetor Lucius Caecilius Metellus Denter died in the battle and was replaced by Manius Curius Dentatus. Dentatus sent envoys to negotiate the release of Roman prisoners, but they were killed. The Romans marched on Gaul (Polybius used this very vague term and must have meant Cisalpine Gaul) and they were met by the Senones who were defeated in a pitched battle. It can be assumed that this clash occurred in the ager Gallicus (the name the Romans gave to the area which had been conquered by the Senones), on the Adriatic coast (in modern Marche) as Polybius wrote that \\"the Romans invaded the territory of the Senones, killed most of them and drove the rest out of the country and founded the colony of Sena Gallia (Senigalia). Polybius also wrote that \\"[h]ereupon the Boii, seeing the Senones expelled from their territory, and fearing a like fate for themselves and their own land, implored the aid of the Etruscans and marched out in full force. The united armies gave battle to the Romans near Lake Vadimon, and in this battle most of the Etruscans were cut to pieces while only quite a few of the Boii escaped.\\" He added that the next year the Boii and the Etruscans engaged the Romans in battle again and \\"were utterly defeated and it was only now that their courage at length gave way and that they sent an embassy to sue for terms and made a treaty with the Romans.\\" Through these clashes the Romans gained further territory along the Adriatic coast, eliminated danger from the Senones and half a century without major conflicts with the Gauls followed. Polybius thought that Rome gained two advantages from these battles: she got used to defeating the Gauls, whom they had feared since the Gallic sack of Rome of 390 BC, and her troops became battle-hardened just before they had to confront Pyrrhus in the Pyrrhic War of 280‚Äì275 BC.Polybius, The Histories, 2.19-7-3, 20 In Etruria there were victorious clashes with Vulsci and Volsinii in 280 BC and Caere in 273 BC and the destruction of Volsinii in 264 BC.

Often the form of the process assumes a game-like appearance. Adversarial politics The use of a voting system to choose candidates to hold political and military power is often necessarily adversarial. This process requires each candidate to convince voters that they are more trustworthy in the expected future circumstances, than their opponent. Adversarial politics takes place when one party (usually not in government) takes the opposite (or at least a different) opinion to that of the other (usually the government) even when they may personally agree with what the government is trying to do. Those opposed to adversarial politics believe that politicians should state what they actually think rather than following the 'party line'. They consider adversarial politics to be cynical and intolerant, with 'winning' the driving principle versus attempting to establish the truth. Politicians captivated by the 'struggle for victory' corrupt the ideals that brought them into politics in the first place. Adversarial politics is often blamed for turning the electorate away from politics and their right to participate in the democratic process of their country through voting at elections. In the US, huge fundraising for presidential elections increasingly results in campaigns focused on personalities versus honest debate, and trading insults versus addressing substantive issues. In the UK the most obvious example is Prime Minister's Questions, a weekly session where the two main parties confront each other. Adversarial legal process The use of an adversarial process by the criminal or civil court to decide the social attitude to an alleged wrongdoing of a defendant, penalties to be imposed, and restitution to be awarded to their deemed victim often depends on the adversarial witness questioning.p.54, MacNeil This is adversarial as the opposing attorneys are competing to convince the judge to include or exclude evidence or witnesses, and competing to convince the judge or jury of the guilt or innocence of the defendant, and severity of the impact of the actions (if guilty) on the plaintiff or victim. Lawyers must be held to rather specific ethical codes, e.g. rules of civil procedure, to ensure that their tactics do not cause an undue burden on larger society, e.g. freeing defendants who have admitted that they are not only guilty but intend to offend again. Lawyers differ on whether the process should be seen as strictly adversarial, in order to ensure they retain the trust of clients and the overall process retains the trust of society, or whether the ethics of the larger society should play a role in their behavior. Other examples A third example of an adversarial process is the operation of market systems, e.g. commodity markets. In these, bid and ask prices are constantly compared, with sellers representing goods as being valuable and buyers haggling and claiming they are less valuable. Product markets tend to focus on the comparison of sellers' products with other sellers' products‚Äîthe adversarial process itself making trustworthy information, e.g. as published in Consumer Reports or the Better Business Bureau, hard to compile and to obtain. Health advocates often claim that market systems are very difficult to reconcile with food, nutrition, agriculture or medicine's need to work well with living systems‚Äîa key complaint of the anti-globalization movement. Alternative systems The alternatives, including consensus decision making and deliberative democracy (which tend to alternate adversary, discussion, and voting over a longer period of time allocated to make the decision and explore implications), are ancient. However, they are less well studied in political science and economics. Most commentators are suspicious of the utopian goals of the advocates of such non-adversarial processes, viewing competition as essential to a good result. Other activists argue that adversarial process works well and should probably be expanded to areas that are presently less adversarial. For instance they advocate \\"science courts\\" and \\"prediction markets\\" that would force the scientist, economist and technologist to put reputations and money on the line, rather than trusting them based on reputation without a disciplined follow-up to see if they were right or wrong. These ideas are increasingly popular in part because such alternative courts and markets can be easily started up on the Internet.

Frank Baum. The road also appears in the several sequel Oz books such as The Marvelous Land of Oz (1904) and The Patchwork Girl of Oz (1913). The road's most notable portrayal is in the classic 1939 MGM musical movie The Wizard of Oz, loosely based on Baum's first Oz book. In the novel's first edition the road is mostly referred to as the \\"Road of Yellow Bricks\\". In the original story and in later films based on it such as The Wiz (1978), Dorothy Gale must find the road before embarking on her journey, as the tornado did not deposit her farmhouse directly in front of it as in the 1939 film. Road's history The following is an excerpt from the third chapter of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, in which Dorothy sets off to see the Wizard: > There were several roads near by, but it did not take Dorothy long to find > the one paved with yellow bricks. Within a short time she was walking > briskly toward the Emerald City; her Silver Shoes tinkling merrily on the > hard, yellow road-bed. The road is first introduced in the third chapter of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The road begins in the heart of the eastern quadrant called Munchkin Country in the Land of Oz. It functions as a guideline that leads all who follow it, to the road's ultimate destination‚Äîthe imperial capital of Oz called Emerald City that is located in the exact center of the entire continent. In the book, the novel's main protagonist, Dorothy, is forced to search for the road before she can begin her quest to seek the Wizard. This is because the cyclone from Kansas did not release her farmhouse closely near it as it did in the various film adaptations. After the council with the native Munchkins and their dear friend the Good Witch of the North, Dorothy begins looking for it and sees many pathways and roads nearby, (all of which lead in various directions). Thankfully it doesn't take her too long to spot the one paved with bright yellow bricks. Later in the book, Dorothy and her companions, the Scarecrow, Tin Woodman and Cowardly Lion discover that the road has fallen into disrepair in some parts of the land, having several broken chasms ending at dangerous cliffs with deadly drops. In the end of the book we learn the road's history; unlike in Walt Disney's prequel film Oz the Great and Powerful (2013), the Emerald City and yellow brick road did not exist prior to Oz's arrival. When Oscar Diggs arrived in Oz via hot air- balloon that had been swept away in a storm, the people of the land were convinced he was a great \\"Wizard\\" who had finally come to fulfill Oz's long- awaited prophecy. Since the recent fall of Oz's mortal King Pastoria, and the mysterious disappearance of his baby daughter Princess Ozma, Oscar immediately proclaimed himself as Oz's new dominant ruler and had his people build the road as well as the city in his honor. In the second Oz book, The Marvelous Land of Oz, Tip and his companion Jack Pumpkinhead, likewise follow a yellow brick road to reach Emerald City while traveling from Oz's northern quadrant, the Gillikin Country.L. Frank Baum, Michael Patrick Hearn, The Annotated Wizard of Oz, p 107, In the book The Patchwork Girl of Oz, it is revealed that there are two yellow brick roads from Munchkin Country to the Emerald City: according to the Shaggy Man, Dorothy took the longer and more dangerous one in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. In the classic 1939 film, a red brick road can be seen starting at the same point as the yellow brick road and is entwined with it, despite seemingly going in a different direction. This version of the road does not exist in Baum's books. Also, at the cornfield where Dorothy meets and befriends the Scarecrow, there is a fork in the yellow brick road leading in different directions. Luckily they choose the correct one of the three branches that leads to Emerald City. In Disney's 1985 live action semi-sequel to the 1939 movie Return to Oz, Dorothy returns to Oz six months after being sent back home to Kansas from her first visit. Upon her second arrival she finds the yellow brick road in ruins by the hands of the evil Nome King who also conquered the Emerald City. In the end, it is presumed that after she defeats him and saves the city and its citizens, the road is restored as well. Real yellow brick roads The actual road is believed to be one in Peekskill, New York, where L. Frank Baum attended Peekskill Military Academy. According to a local legend, the Yellow Brick Road was derived from a road paved with yellow bricks near Holland, Michigan, where Baum spent summers. Ithaca, New York, also makes a claim for being Frank Baum's inspiration. He opened a road tour of his musical, The Maid of Arran, in Ithaca, and he met his future wife Maud Gage Baum while she was attending Cornell University. At the time, yellow bricks paved local roads. Yellow brick roads can also be found in Aberdeen, South Dakota; Albany, New York; Rossville (Baltimore County), Maryland; Montclair, New Jersey (Parkhurst Place and Afterglow Way); Bronxville, New York (on Prescott and Valley roads); Chicago, Illinois; Liberal, Kansas; Sedan, Kansas and Chittenango, New York, as well as a school in Abington, Pennsylvania, and abroad in Sofia, Bulgaria. In addition, portions of U.S. Route 54 within the state of Kansas have been designated \\"the yellow brick road\\". Two direct, and the only published, references to the origin of the Yellow Brick Road came from Baum's own descendants: his son Frank Joslyn Baum in To Please A Child and the other by Roger S. Baum, the great-grandson of L. Frank Baum who stated, \\"Most people don't realize that the Wizard of Oz was written in Chicago, and the Yellow Brick Road was named after winding cobblestone roads in Holland, Michigan, where great-grandfather spent vacations with his family.\\" Dallas, Texas makes a claim that Baum once stayed at a downtown hotel during his newspaper career (located near what is now the Triple Underpass) at a time when the streets were paved with wooden blocks of Bois D'Arc also known as Osage Orange. Supposedly, after a rainstorm the sun came out and he saw a bright yellow brick road from the window of his room. The Vision Oz Fund was established in November 2009 to raise funds that will be used to help increase the awareness, enhancement, and further development of Oz-related attractions and assets in Wamego, Kansas. The first fundraiser is underway and includes selling personalized engraved yellow bricks, which will become part of the permanent walkway (aka \\"The Yellow Brick Road\\") in downtown Wamego.

The effectiveness depends on the freezing and boiling points of the gas relative to the cryopump's temperature. They are sometimes used to block particular contaminants, for example in front of a diffusion pump to trap backstreaming oil, or in front of a McLeod gauge to keep out water. In this function, they are called a cryotrap, waterpump or cold trap, even though the physical mechanism is the same as for a cryopump. Cryotrapping can also refer to a somewhat different effect, where molecules will increase their residence time on a cold surface without actually freezing (supercooling). There is a delay between the molecule impinging on the surface and rebounding from it. Kinetic energy will have been lost as the molecules slow down. For example, hydrogen does not condense at 8 kelvins, but it can be cryotrapped. This effectively traps molecules for an extended period and thereby removes them from the vacuum environment just like cryopumping. History Early experiments into cryotrapping of gasses in activated charcoal were conducted as far back as 1874. The first cryopumps mainly used liquid helium to cool the pump, either in a large liquid helium reservoir, or by continuous flow into the cryopump. However, over time most cryopumps were redesigned to use gaseous helium, enabled by the invention of better cryocoolers. The key refrigeration technology was discovered in the 1950s by two employees of the Massachusetts- based company Arthur D. Little Inc., William E. Gifford and Howard O. McMahon. This technology came to be known as the Gifford-McMahon cryocooler. In the 1970s, the Gifford-McMahon cryocooler was used to make a vacuum pump by Helix Technology Corporation and its subsidiary company Cryogenic Technology Inc. In 1976, cryopumps began to be used in IBM's manufacturing of integrated circuits. The use of cryopumps became common in semiconductor manufacturing worldwide, with expansions such as a cryogenics company founded jointly by Helix and ULVAC (jp:„Ç¢„É´„Éê„ÉÉ„ÇØ) in 1981. Operation Cryopumps are commonly cooled by compressed helium, though they may also use dry ice, liquid nitrogen, or stand-alone versions may include a built-in cryocooler. Baffles are often attached to the cold head to expand the surface area available for condensation, but these also increase the radiative heat uptake of the cryopump. Over time, the surface eventually saturates with condensate and thus the pumping speed gradually drops to zero. It will hold the trapped gases as long as it remains cold, but it will not condense fresh gases from leaks or backstreaming until it is regenerated. Saturation happens very quickly in low vacuums, so cryopumps are usually only used in high or ultrahigh vacuum systems. The cryopump provides fast, clean pumping of all gases in the 10‚àí3 to 10‚àí9 Torr range. The cryopump operates on the principle that gases can be condensed and held at extremely low vapor pressures, achieving high speeds and throughputs. The cold head consists of a two-stage cold head cylinder (part of the vacuum vessel) and a drive unit displacer assembly. These together produce closed-cycle refrigeration at temperatures that range from 60 to 80K for the first-stage cold station to 10 to 20K for the second-stage cold station, typically. Some cryopumps have multiple stages at various low temperatures, with the outer stages shielding the coldest inner stages. The outer stages condense high boiling point gases such as water and oil, thus saving the surface area and refrigeration capacity of the inner stages for lower boiling point gases such as nitrogen. As cooling temperatures decrease when using dry ice, liquid nitrogen, then compressed helium, lower molecular-weight gases can be trapped. Trapping nitrogen, helium, and hydrogen requires extremely low temperatures (~10K) and large surface area as described below. Even at this temperature, the lighter gases helium and hydrogen have very low trapping efficiency and are the predominant molecules in ultra-high vacuum systems. Cryopumps are often combined with sorption pumps by coating the cold head with highly adsorbing materials such as activated charcoal or a zeolite. As the sorbent saturates, the effectiveness of a sorption pump decreases, but can be recharged by heating the zeolite material (preferably under conditions of low pressure) to outgas it. The breakdown temperature of the zeolite material's porous structure may limit the maximum temperature that it may be heated to for regeneration. Sorption pumps are a type of cryopump that is often used as roughing pumps to reduce pressures from the range of atmospheric to on the order of 0.1 Pa (10‚àí3 Torr), while lower pressures are achieved using a finishing pump (see vacuum). =Regeneration= Regeneration of a cryopump is the process of evaporating the trapped gases. During a regeneration cycle, the cryopump is warmed to room temperature or higher, allowing trapped gases to change from a solid state to a gaseous state and thereby be released from the cryopump through a pressure relief valve into the atmosphere. Most production equipment utilizing a cryopump have a means to isolate the cryopump from the vacuum chamber so regeneration takes place without exposing the vacuum system to released gasses such as water vapor. Water vapor is the hardest natural element to remove from vacuum chamber walls upon exposure to the atmosphere due to monolayer formation and hydrogen bonding. Adding heat to the dry nitrogen purge-gas will speed the warm-up and reduce the regeneration time. When regeneration is complete, the cryopump will be roughed to 50Œºm (50 milliTorr or ŒºmHg), isolated, and the rate-of-rise (ROR) will be monitored to test for complete regeneration. If the ROR exceeds 10Œºm/min the cryopump will require additional purge time.

Joseph Nollekens R.A. (11 August 1737 ‚Äì 23 April 1823) was a sculptor from London generally considered to be the finest British sculptor of the late 18th century. Life Nollekens was born on 11 August 1737 at 28 Dean Street, Soho, London, the son of the Flemish painter Josef Frans Nollekens (1702‚Äì1748) who had moved from Antwerp to London in 1733. He studied first under another Flemish immigrant in London, the sculptor Peter Scheemakers, before studying and working as an antiques dealer, restorer and copier in Rome from 1760 or 1762. The sculptures he made in Rome included a marble of Timocles Before Alexander, for which he was awarded fifty guineas by the Society of Arts, and busts of Laurence Sterne and David Garrick, who were visiting the city. On his return to London in 1770 he set up as a maker of busts and monuments at 9, Mortimer Street, where he built up a large practice. Although he preferred working on mythological subjects, it was through his portrait busts that he became famous and one of the most fashionable portrait sculptors in Britain. He enjoyed the patronage of king George III and went on to sculpt a number of British political figures, including George III himself, William Pitt the Younger, Charles James Fox, the Duke of Bedford and Charles Watson-Wentworth. He also made busts of figures from the arts such as Benjamin West. Most of his subjects were represented in classical costume. Faith, a sculpture commissioned by Henry Howard following the death of his wife Maria in 1788 in childbirth at Corby Castle, is said to be Nollekens' finest work. The sculpture can be seen in the Howard Chapel at the Parish Church of Wetheral, Cumbria. 'Faith' in Wetheral Parish Church, Cumbria. Commissioned by Henry Howard after the death of his wife Maria in 1788. Although he took great care over the modelling of the details of his sculptures, the marble versions were normally made by assistants, such as Sebastian Gahagan who carved Nollekens' statue of William Pitt for the Senate House at Cambridge, and L. Alexander Goblet. Some subjects were produced in large numbers: more than 70 replicas of Nollekens' bust of Pitt are known. Nollekens became an associate of the Royal Academy in 1771 and a full academician the following year. Death He died in London in 1823, having made a considerable fortune from his work; he left around ¬£200,000 in his will. He is buried in Paddington Parish Church with a monument by William Behnes. A biography Nollekens and his Times by his executor John Thomas Smith was published in 1828, portraying him as a grotesque miser. It has been described as \\"perhaps the most candid biography ever published in the English language.\\" No. 44 Mortimer Street in Fitzrovia stands on the site of the house where Nollekens died and has a blue plaque commemorating him. American poet Randall Jarrell commemorated Nollekens in his poem entitled \\"Nollekens\\", collected in his 1956 volume Selected Poems.

Clearance rates are used by various groups as a measure of crimes solved by the police. Clearance rates can be problematic for measuring the performance of police services and for comparing various police services.

For example, each police force may have a different method of recording when a \\"crime\\" has occurred and different criteria for determining when a crime has been \\"cleared.\\" One police force may appear to have a much better clearance rate because of its calculation methodology. In System Conflict Theory, it is argued that clearance rates cause the police to focus on appearing to solve crimes (generating high clearance rate scores) rather than actually solving crimes.

Typesetting is the composition of text by means of arranging physical typesDictionary.com Unabridged. Random House, Inc. 23 December 2009. Dictionary.reference.com or the digital equivalents. Stored letters and other symbols (called sorts in mechanical systems and glyphs in digital systems) are retrieved and ordered according to a language's orthography for visual display. Typesetting requires one or more fonts (which are widely but erroneously confused with and substituted for typefaces). One significant effect of typesetting was that authorship of works could be spotted more easily, making it difficult for copiers who have not gained permission.Murray, Stuart A., The Library: An Illustrated History, ALA edition, Skyhorse, 2009, page 131 Pre-digital era=Manual typesetting= During much of the letterpress era, movable type was composed by hand for each page. Cast metal sorts were composed into words, then lines, then paragraphs, then pages of text and tightly bound together to make up a form, with all letter faces exactly the same \\"height to paper\\", creating an even surface of type. The form was placed in a press, inked, and an impression made on paper.Lyons, M. (2001). Books: A Living History. (P. 59-61). During typesetting, individual sorts are picked from a type case with the right hand, and set into a composing stick held in the left hand from left to right, and as viewed by the setter upside down. As seen in the photo of the composing stick, a lower case 'q' looks like a 'd', a lower case 'b' looks like a 'p', a lower case 'p' looks like a 'b' and a lower case 'd' looks like a 'q'. This is reputed to be the origin of the expression \\"mind your p's and q's\\". It might just as easily have been \\"mind your b's and d's\\".Lyons, M. (2001). Books: A Living History. (P. 59-61). The diagram at right illustrates a cast metal sort: a face, b body or shank, c point size, 1 shoulder, 2 nick, 3 groove, 4 foot. Wooden printing sorts were in use for centuries in combination with metal type. Not shown, and more the concern of the casterman, is the ‚Äúset‚Äù, or width of each sort. Set width, like body size, is measured in points. In order to extend the working life of type, and to account for the finite sorts in a case of type, copies of forms were cast when anticipating subsequent printings of a text, freeing the costly type for other work. This was particularly prevalent in book and newspaper work where rotary presses required type forms to wrap an impression cylinder rather than set in the bed of a press. In this process, called stereotyping, the entire form is pressed into a fine matrix such as plaster of Paris or papier m√¢ch√© called a flong to create a positive, from which the stereotype form was electrotyped, cast of type metal. Advances such as the typewriter and computer would push the state of the art even farther ahead. Still, hand composition and letterpress printing have not fallen completely out of use, and since the introduction of digital typesetting, it has seen a revival as an artisanal pursuit. However, it is a very small niche within the larger typesetting market. =Hot metal typesetting= The time and effort required to manually compose the text led to several efforts in the 19th century to produce mechanical typesetting. While some, such as the Paige compositor, met with limited success, by the end of the 19th century, several methods had been devised whereby an operator working a keyboard or other devices could produce the desired text. Most of the successful systems involved the in-house casting of the type to be used, hence are termed \\"hot metal\\" typesetting. The Linotype machine, invented in 1884, used a keyboard to assemble the casting matrices, and cast an entire line of type at a time (hence its name). In the Monotype System, a keyboard was used to punch a paper tape, which was then fed to control a casting machine. The Ludlow Typograph involved hand-set matrices, but otherwise used hot metal. By the early 20th century, the various systems were nearly universal in large newspapers and publishing houses. =Phototypesetting= Linotype CRTronic 360 phototypesetting terminal Phototypesetting or \\"cold type\\" systems first appeared in the early 1960s and rapidly displaced continuous casting machines. These devices consisted of glass or film disks or strips (one per font) that spun in front of a light source to selectively expose characters onto light- sensitive paper. Originally they were driven by pre-punched paper tapes. Later they were connected to computer front ends. One of the earliest electronic photocomposition systems was introduced by Fairchild Semiconductor. The typesetter typed a line of text on a Fairchild keyboard that had no display. To verify correct content of the line it was typed a second time. If the two lines were identical a bell rang and the machine produced a punched paper tape corresponding to the text. With the completion of a block of lines the typesetter fed the corresponding paper tapes into a phototypesetting device that mechanically set type outlines printed on glass sheets into place for exposure onto a negative film. Photosensitive paper was exposed to light through the negative film, resulting in a column of black type on white paper, or a galley. The galley was then cut up and used to create a mechanical drawing or paste up of a whole page. A large film negative of the page is shot and used to make plates for offset printing. Digital era Dutch newsreel from 1977 about the transition to computer typesetting The next generation of phototypesetting machines to emerge were those that generated characters on a cathode ray tube. Typical of the type were the Alphanumeric APS2 (1963),Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Technology, 1976 IBM 2680 (1967), I.I.I. VideoComp (1973?), Autologic APS5 (1975),Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Technology and Linotron 202 (1978).Linotype History These machines were the mainstay of phototypesetting for much of the 1970s and 1980s. Such machines could be \\"driven online\\" by a computer front-end system or took their data from magnetic tape. Type fonts were stored digitally on conventional magnetic disk drives. Computers excel at automatically typesetting and correcting documents. (webpage has a translation button) Character-by- character, computer-aided phototypesetting was, in turn, rapidly rendered obsolete in the 1980s by fully digital systems employing a raster image processor to render an entire page to a single high-resolution digital image, now known as imagesetting. The first commercially successful laser imagesetter, able to make use of a raster image processor was the Monotype Lasercomp. ECRM, Compugraphic (later purchased by Agfa) and others rapidly followed suit with machines of their own. Early minicomputer-based typesetting software introduced in the 1970s and early 1980s, such as Datalogics Pager, Penta, Atex, Miles 33, Xyvision, troff from Bell Labs, and IBM's Script product with CRT terminals, were better able to drive these electromechanical devices, and used text markup languages to describe type and other page formatting information. The descendants of these text markup languages include SGML, XML and HTML. The minicomputer systems output columns of text on film for paste-up and eventually produced entire pages and signatures of 4, 8, 16 or more pages using imposition software on devices such as the Israeli-made Scitex Dolev. The data stream used by these systems to drive page layout on printers and imagesetters, often proprietary or specific to a manufacturer or device, drove development of generalized printer control languages, such as Adobe Systems' PostScript and Hewlett-Packard's PCL. Text sample (an extract of the essay The Renaissance of English Art by Oscar Wilde) typeset in Iowan Old Style roman, italics and small caps, adjusted to approximately 10 words per line, with the typeface sized at 14 points on 1.4 x leading, with 0.2 points extra tracking. Computerized typesetting was so rare that BYTE magazine (comparing itself to \\"the proverbial shoemaker's children who went barefoot\\") did not use any computers in production until its August 1979 issue used a Compugraphics system for typesetting and page layout. The magazine did not yet accept articles on floppy disks, but hoped to do so \\"as matters progress\\". Before the 1980s, practically all typesetting for publishers and advertisers was performed by specialist typesetting companies. These companies performed keyboarding, editing and production of paper or film output, and formed a large component of the graphic arts industry. In the United States, these companies were located in rural Pennsylvania, New England or the Midwest, where labor was cheap and paper was produced nearby, but still within a few hours' travel time of the major publishing centers. In 1985, with the new concept of WYSIWYG (for What You See Is What You Get) in text editing and word processing on personal computers, desktop publishing became available, starting with the Apple Macintosh, Aldus PageMaker (and later QuarkXPress) and PostScript and on the PC platform with Xerox Ventura Publisher under DOS as well as Pagemaker under Windows. Improvements in software and hardware, and rapidly lowering costs, popularized desktop publishing and enabled very fine control of typeset results much less expensively than the minicomputer dedicated systems. At the same time, word processing systems, such as Wang and WordPerfect and Microsoft Word, revolutionized office documents. They did not, however, have the typographic ability or flexibility required for complicated book layout, graphics, mathematics, or advanced hyphenation and justification rules (H and J). By the year 2000, this industry segment had shrunk because publishers were now capable of integrating typesetting and graphic design on their own in-house computers. Many found the cost of maintaining high standards of typographic design and technical skill made it more economical to outsource to freelancers and graphic design specialists. The availability of cheap or free fonts made the conversion to do-it-yourself easier, but also opened up a gap between skilled designers and amateurs. The advent of PostScript, supplemented by the PDF file format, provided a universal method of proofing designs and layouts, readable on major computers and operating systems. =SCRIPT variants= Mural mosaic \\"Typesetter\\" at John A. Prior Health Sciences Library in Ohio IBM created and inspired a family of typesetting languages with names that were derivatives of the word \\"SCRIPT\\". Later versions of SCRIPT included advanced features, such as automatic generation of a table of contents and index, multicolumn page layout, footnotes, boxes, automatic hyphenation and spelling verification.U01-0547, \\"Introduction to SCRIPT,\\" is available through PRTDOC. NSCRIPT was a port of SCRIPT to OS and TSO from CP-67/CMS SCRIPT.SCRIPT 90.1 Implementation Guide, June 6, 1990 Waterloo Script was created at the University of Waterloo later.CSG.uwaterloo.ca One version of SCRIPT was created at MIT and the AA/CS at UW took over project development in 1974. The program was first used at UW in 1975. In the 1970s, SCRIPT was the only practical way to word process and format documents using a computer. By the late 1980s, the SCRIPT system had been extended to incorporate various upgrades.A Chronology of Computing at The University of Waterloo The initial implementation of SCRIPT at UW was documented in the May 1975 issue of the Computing Centre Newsletter, which noted some the advantages of using SCRIPT: The article also pointed out SCRIPT had over 100 commands to assist in formatting documents, though 8 to 10 of these commands were sufficient to complete most formatting jobs. Thus, SCRIPT had many of the capabilities computer users generally associate with contemporary word processors.Glossary of University of Waterloo Computing Chronology SCRIPT/VS was a SCRIPT variant developed at IBM in the 1980s. DWScript is a version of SCRIPT for MS-DOS, called after its author, D. D. Williams,DWScript ‚Äì Document Composition Facility for the IBM Personal Computer Version 4.6 Updates, DW-04167, Nov 8th, 1985 but was never released to the public and only used internally by IBM. Script is still available from IBM as part of the Document Composition Facility for the z/OS operating system.IBM Document Composition Facility (DCF) =SGML and XML systems= The standard generalized markup language (SGML) was based upon IBM Generalized Markup Language (GML). GML was a set of macros on top of IBM Script. DSSSL is an international standard developed to provide a stylesheets for SGML documents. XML is a successor of SGML. XSL-FO is most often used to generate PDF files from XML files. The arrival of SGML/XML as the document model made other typesetting engines popular. Such engines include Datalogics Pager, Penta, Miles 33's OASYS, Xyvision's XML Professional Publisher (XPP), FrameMaker, Arbortext. XSL-FO compatible engines include Apache FOP, Antenna House Formatter, RenderX's XEP. These products allow users to program their SGML/XML typesetting process with the help of scripting languages. YesLogic's Prince is another one, which is based on CSS Paged Media. =Troff and successors= During the mid-1970s, Joe Ossanna, working at Bell Laboratories, wrote the troff typesetting program to drive a Wang C/A/T phototypesetter owned by the Labs; it was later enhanced by Brian Kernighan to support output to different equipment, such as laser printers. While its use has fallen off, it is still included with a number of Unix and Unix-like systems, and has been used to typeset a number of high-profile technical and computer books. Some versions, as well as a GNU work-alike called groff, are now open source. =TeX and LaTeX= Mathematical text typeset using TeX and the AMS Euler font. The TeX system, developed by Donald E. Knuth at the end of the 1970s, is another widespread and powerful automated typesetting system that has set high standards, especially for typesetting mathematics. LuaTeX and LuaLaTeX are variants of TeX and of LaTeX scriptable in Lua. TeX is considered fairly difficult to learn on its own, and deals more with appearance than structure. The LaTeX macro package written by Leslie Lamport at the beginning of the 1980s offered a simpler interface, and an easier way to systematically encode the structure of a document. LaTeX markup is very widely used in academic circles for published papers and even books. Although standard TeX does not provide an interface of any sort, there are programs that do. These programs include Scientific Workplace, TeXmacs, MiKTeX and LyX, which are graphical/interactive editors.

Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 27 Mar. 2014; See also Alain Jacobs (1999), Laurent Delvaux 1696-1778, Paris, Arthena, 1999, passim. He walked to Rome where he and Delvaux studied both classical and baroque styles of sculpture before settling in London in 1716. He and Delvaux worked there with another Flemish sculptor Pieter-Denis Plumier on a funeral monument to John Sheffield, Duke of Buckingham, which they delivered in 1722 after the death of Plumier. Scheemakers and Delvaux entered into a formal partnership and set up a workshop in Millbank, Westminster, in 1723. Their workshop produced many sober classical monuments and garden statuary after the Antique. The partners sold their stock in the partnership and travelled to Rome in 1728. Scheemakers stayed here for two years to study both antique and recent masterpieces. Upon his return to England in 1730 Scheemakers restarted the Milbank workshop on his own. His 'ideal' classical sculptures became very popular with the landowning class and the city merchants. He moved his workshop a few times: first to Old Palace Yard in 1736 and then to Vine Street in 1740 where he was active until his retirement in 1771. He returned to Antwerp where he died at the old age of 90. He worked for a time with Francis Bird, and was the teacher of Henry Cheere and Charles Cope Trubshaw, amongst others.Biographical details at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Joseph Nollekens joined his studio in 1747 and served his apprenticeship here, before leaving for Rome in 1762. Scheemakers' brother, Henry Scheemakers, and his son, Thomas Scheemakers, were both also sculptors. Works Statue of Thomas Guy =Westminster Abbey= Fifteen of Scheemakers' works ‚Äì monuments, figures and busts ‚Äì are in Westminster Abbey; two were executed in collaboration with his master Delvaux: the ‚ÄúHugh Chamberlen‚Äù (d. 1728, and therefore perhaps produced during his first visit to London) and ‚ÄúCatherine, duchess of Buckinghamshire.‚Äù He is best known by his monument to Shakespeare (1740), but as this work was designed by Kent the responsibility must not all be laid to Scheemakers' account. In addition to these, there are the monuments to Admiral Sir Charles Wager, Vice-Admiral Watson, Lieut.-General Percy Kirk, George Lord Viscount Howe, General Monck, and Sir Henry Belasye. His busts of John Dryden (1720) and Dr Richard Mead (1754), also in the Abbey, are noted examples of his smaller works. =Other English works= Works outside of Westminster Abbey are memorials to the 1st and 2nd Dukes of Ancaster at Edenham, Lincolnshire; Lord Chancellor Hardwicke at Wimpole, Cambridgeshire; the Duke of Kent, his wives and daughters, at Fletton, Bedfordshire; the Earl of Shelburne, at Wycombe, Bucks; and the figure on the sarcophagus to Montague Sherrard Drake, at Amersham. Another example of his work is the memorial to Topham Foote (or Foot) in the parish church of St John the Baptist, Windsor. This burial monument, which includes the young man's bust and the Foote family crest, greets visitors in the main High Street entrance, just from the Henry VIII gate to Windsor Castle. He also sculpted a memorial for the Petty family, marking the family burial place in All Saints' Parish Church, High Wycombe, which depicts the family in Roman dress, and designed the gilded equestrian statue of King William III erected at Kingston upon Hull (1734). Bacchus, Wrest Park, Bedfordshire =Ireland= In 1743, Mary Coghill erected the parish church of Clonturk (now Drumcondra Church) in memory of her brother Marmaduke Coghill, and placed in it a statue of her brother by Peter Scheemakers. He also was the sculptor of fourteen of the busts in the Long Room of the Trinity College Library in Dublin, including Homer, Aristotle and Socrates.

Chaeronea was subject to Orchomenus which was, beginning in 600 BC, a member of the Boeotian League. In the late 5th century BC, Chaironeia belonged to one of the 11 Boeotian districts along with Acraephnium and Copia. Chaeronea was the site of several historical battles. Best known is that of 338 BC, between Philip II of Macedon and a coalition of various Greek states, mainly Thebes and Athens. During the battle, the elite unit of Theban soldiers known as the Sacred Band of Thebes was wiped out completely (See Battle of Chaeronea). In 1818, the so-called Lion of Chaeronea, a nearly funerary monument erected in honor of the Sacred Band, was rediscovered by English travellers. The fragmentary monument was reassembled and installed in 1902 by an organisation called the Order of Chaeronea atop a pedestal at the site of its discovery.'An Army of Lovers' ‚Äì The Sacred Band of Thebes The ancient biographer and essayist Plutarch was born in Chaeronea, and several times refers to these and other facts about his native place in his writings.

This is analogous to the behavior of an elongated rubber-band. An animation of color confinement. If energy is supplied to the quarks as shown, the gluon tube elongates until it reaches a point where it \\"snaps\\" and forms a quark‚Äìantiquark pair. Thus single quarks are never seen in isolation. In quantum chromodynamics (QCD), color confinement, often simply called confinement, is the phenomenon that color- charged particles (such as quarks and gluons) cannot be isolated, and therefore cannot be directly observed in normal conditions below the Hagedorn temperature of approximately 2 terakelvin (corresponding to energies of approximately 130‚Äì140 MeV per particle). Quarks and gluons must clump together to form hadrons. The two main types of hadron are the mesons (one quark, one antiquark) and the baryons (three quarks). In addition, colorless glueballs formed only of gluons are also consistent with confinement, though difficult to identify experimentally. Quarks and gluons cannot be separated from their parent hadron without producing new hadrons. Origin  There is not yet an analytic proof of color confinement in any non-abelian gauge theory. The phenomenon can be understood qualitatively by noting that the force-carrying gluons of QCD have color charge, unlike the photons of quantum electrodynamics (QED). Whereas the electric field between electrically charged particles decreases rapidly as those particles are separated, the gluon field between a pair of color charges forms a narrow flux tube (or string) between them. Because of this behavior of the gluon field, the strong force between the particles is constant regardless of their separation. Therefore, as two color charges are separated, at some point it becomes energetically favorable for a new quark‚Äìantiquark pair to appear, rather than extending the tube further. As a result of this, when quarks are produced in particle accelerators, instead of seeing the individual quarks in detectors, scientists see \\"jets\\" of many color-neutral particles (mesons and baryons), clustered together. This process is called hadronization, fragmentation, or string breaking. The confining phase is usually defined by the behavior of the action of the Wilson loop, which is simply the path in spacetime traced out by a quark‚Äìantiquark pair created at one point and annihilated at another point. In a non-confining theory, the action of such a loop is proportional to its perimeter. However, in a confining theory, the action of the loop is instead proportional to its area. Since the area is proportional to the separation of the quark‚Äìantiquark pair, free quarks are suppressed. Mesons are allowed in such a picture, since a loop containing another loop with the opposite orientation has only a small area between the two loops. Confinement scale The confinement scale or QCD scale is the scale at which the perturbatively defined strong coupling constant diverges. Its definition and value therefore depend on the renormalization scheme used. For example, in the MS-bar scheme and at 4-loop in the running of \\\\alpha_s, the world average in the 3-flavour case is given by :\\\\Lambda^{(3)}_\\\\overline{MS} = (332 \\\\pm 17) \\\\,\\\\rm{MeV} \\\\,. When the renormalization group equation is solved exactly, the scale is not defined at all. It is therefore customary to quote the value of the strong coupling constant at a particular reference scale instead. Models exhibiting confinement In addition to QCD in four spacetime dimensions, the two- dimensional Schwinger model also exhibits confinement. Compact Abelian gauge theories also exhibit confinement in 2 and 3 spacetime dimensions. Confinement has recently been found in elementary excitations of magnetic systems called spinons. If the electroweak symmetry breaking scale were lowered, the unbroken SU(2) interaction would eventually become confining. Alternative models where SU(2) becomes confining above that scale are quantitatively similar to the Standard Model at lower energies, but dramatically different above symmetry breaking. Models of fully screened quarks Besides the quark confinement idea, there is a potential possibility that the color charge of quarks gets fully screened by the gluonic color surrounding the quark. Exact solutions of SU(3) classical Yang‚ÄìMills theory which provide full screening (by gluon fields) of the color charge of a quark have been found. However, such classical solutions do not take into account non-trivial properties of QCD vacuum. Therefore, the significance of such full gluonic screening solutions for a separated quark is not clear.  QCD string  In quantum chromodynamics (or in the more general case of quantum gauge theories), if a connection which is color confining occurs, it is possible for stringlike degrees of freedom called QCD strings or QCD flux tubes to form. These stringlike excitations are responsible for the confinement of color charges since they are always attached to at least one string which exhibits tension. Their existence can be predicted from the dual spin network/spin foam models (this duality is exact over a lattice). To a surprisingly good approximation, these strings are described phenomenologically by the Polyakov action, making them noncritical strings.

Classification of simple shapes  A variety of polygonal shapes. Some simple shapes can be put into broad categories . For instance, polygons are classified according to their number of edges as triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons, etc. Each of these is divided into smaller categories; triangles can be equilateral, isosceles, obtuse, acute, scalene, etc. while quadrilaterals can be rectangles, rhombi, trapezoids, squares, etc. Other common shapes are points, lines, planes, and conic sections such as ellipses, circles, and parabolas. Among the most common 3-dimensional shapes are polyhedra, which are shapes with flat faces; ellipsoids, which are egg-shaped or sphere-shaped objects; cylinders; and cones. If an object falls into one of these categories exactly or even approximately, we can use it to describe the shape of the object. Thus, we say that the shape of a manhole cover is a disk, because it is approximately the same geometric object as an actual geometric disk. In geometry There are several ways to compare the shapes of two objects: * Congruence: Two objects are congruent if one can be transformed into the other by a sequence of rotations, translations, and/or reflections. * Similarity: Two objects are similar if one can be transformed into the other by a uniform scaling, together with a sequence of rotations, translations, and/or reflections. * Isotopy: Two objects are isotopic if one can be transformed into the other by a sequence of deformations that do not tear the object or put holes in it. Sometimes, two similar or congruent objects may be regarded as having a different shape if a reflection is required to transform one into the other. For instance, the letters \\"b\\" and \\"d\\" are a reflection of each other, and hence they are congruent and similar, but in some contexts they are not regarded as having the same shape. Sometimes, only the outline or external boundary of the object is considered to determine its shape. For instance, a hollow sphere may be considered to have the same shape as a solid sphere. Procrustes analysis is used in many sciences to determine whether or not two objects have the same shape, or to measure the difference between two shapes. In advanced mathematics, quasi-isometry can be used as a criterion to state that two shapes are approximately the same. Simple shapes can often be classified into basic geometric objects such as a point, a line, a curve, a plane, a plane figure (e.g. square or circle), or a solid figure (e.g. cube or sphere). However, most shapes occurring in the physical world are complex. Some, such as plant structures and coastlines, may be so complicated as to defy traditional mathematical description ‚Äì in which case they may be analyzed by differential geometry, or as fractals. = Equivalence of shapes = In geometry, two subsets of a Euclidean space have the same shape if one can be transformed to the other by a combination of translations, rotations (together also called rigid transformations), and uniform scalings. In other words, the shape of a set of points is all the geometrical information that is invariant to translations, rotations, and size changes. Having the same shape is an equivalence relation, and accordingly a precise mathematical definition of the notion of shape can be given as being an equivalence class of subsets of a Euclidean space having the same shape. Mathematician and statistician David George Kendall writes: > In this paper ‚Äòshape‚Äô is used in the vulgar sense, and means what one would > normally expect it to mean. [...] We here define ‚Äòshape‚Äô informally as ‚Äòall > the geometrical information that remains when location, scaleHere, scale > means only uniform scaling, as non-uniform scaling would change the shape of > the object (e.g., it would turn a square into a rectangle). and rotational > effects are filtered out from an object.‚Äô Shapes of physical objects are equal if the subsets of space these objects occupy satisfy the definition above. In particular, the shape does not depend on the size and placement in space of the object. For instance, a \\"d\\" and a \\"p\\" have the same shape, as they can be perfectly superimposed if the \\"d\\" is translated to the right by a given distance, rotated upside down and magnified by a given factor (see Procrustes superimposition for details). However, a mirror image could be called a different shape. For instance, a \\"b\\" and a \\"p\\" have a different shape, at least when they are constrained to move within a two-dimensional space like the page on which they are written. Even though they have the same size, there's no way to perfectly superimpose them by translating and rotating them along the page. Similarly, within a three- dimensional space, a right hand and a left hand have a different shape, even if they are the mirror images of each other. Shapes may change if the object is scaled non-uniformly. For example, a sphere becomes an ellipsoid when scaled differently in the vertical and horizontal directions. In other words, preserving axes of symmetry (if they exist) is important for preserving shapes. Also, shape is determined by only the outer boundary of an object. =Congruence and similarity= Objects that can be transformed into each other by rigid transformations and mirroring (but not scaling) are congruent. An object is therefore congruent to its mirror image (even if it is not symmetric), but not to a scaled version. Two congruent objects always have either the same shape or mirror image shapes, and have the same size. Objects that have the same shape or mirror image shapes are called geometrically similar, whether or not they have the same size. Thus, objects that can be transformed into each other by rigid transformations, mirroring, and uniform scaling are similar. Similarity is preserved when one of the objects is uniformly scaled, while congruence is not. Thus, congruent objects are always geometrically similar, but similar objects may not be congruent, as they may have different size. = Homeomorphism = A more flexible definition of shape takes into consideration the fact that realistic shapes are often deformable, e.g. a person in different postures, a tree bending in the wind or a hand with different finger positions. One way of modeling non-rigid movements is by homeomorphisms. Roughly speaking, a homeomorphism is a continuous stretching and bending of an object into a new shape. Thus, a square and a circle are homeomorphic to each other, but a sphere and a donut are not. An often- repeated mathematical joke is that topologists cannot tell their coffee cup from their donut, since a sufficiently pliable donut could be reshaped to the form of a coffee cup by creating a dimple and progressively enlarging it, while preserving the donut hole in a cup's handle. A described shape has external lines that you can see and make up the shape. If you were putting you coordinates on and coordinate graph you could draw lines to show where you can see a shape, however not every time you put coordinates in a graph as such you can make a shape. This shape has a outline and boundary so you can see it and is not just regular dots on a regular paper.  Shape analysis  The above- mentioned mathematical definitions of rigid and non-rigid shape have arisen in the field of statistical shape analysis. In particular, Procrustes analysis is a technique used for comparing shapes of similar objects (e.g. bones of different animals), or measuring the deformation of a deformable object. Other methods are designed to work with non-rigid (bendable) objects, e.g. for posture independent shape retrieval (see for example Spectral shape analysis). Similarity classes All similar triangles have the same shape. These shapes can be classified using complex numbers u, v, w for the vertices, in a method advanced by J.A. LesterJ.A. Lester (1996) \\"Triangles I: Shapes\\", Aequationes Mathematicae 52:30‚Äì54 and Rafael Artzy. For example, an equilateral triangle can be expressed by the complex numbers 0, 1, (1 + i ‚àö3)/2 representing its vertices. Lester and Artzy call the ratio :S(u, v, w) = \\\\frac{u - w}{u - v} the shape of triangle (u, v, w). Then the shape of the equilateral triangle is :(0‚Äì(1+ ‚àö3)/2)/(0‚Äì1) = ( 1 + i ‚àö3)/2 = cos(60¬∞) + i sin(60¬∞) = exp( i œÄ/3). For any affine transformation of the complex plane, z \\\\mapsto a z + b,\\\\quad a e 0, a triangle is transformed but does not change its shape. Hence shape is an invariant of affine geometry. The shape p = S(u,v,w) depends on the order of the arguments of function S, but permutations lead to related values. For instance, :1 - p = 1 - (u-w)/(u-v) = (w-v)/(u-v) = (v-w)/(v-u) = S(v,u,w). Also p^{-1} = S(u,w,v). Combining these permutations gives S(v,w,u) = (1 - p)^{-1}. Furthermore, :p(1-p)^{-1} = S(u,v,w)S(v,w,u)=(u-w)/(v-w)=S(w,v,u). These relations are \\"conversion rules\\" for shape of a triangle. The shape of a quadrilateral is associated with two complex numbers p,q. If the quadrilateral has vertices u,v,w,x, then p = S(u,v,w) and q = S(v,w,x). Artzy proves these propositions about quadrilateral shapes: # If p=(1-q)^{-1}, then the quadrilateral is a parallelogram. # If a parallelogram has  arg p  =  arg q , then it is a rhombus. # When p = 1 + i and q = (1 + i)/2, then the quadrilateral is square. # If p = r(1-q^{-1}) and sgn r = sgn(Im p), then the quadrilateral is a trapezoid. A polygon (z_1, z_2,...z_n) has a shape defined by n ‚Äì 2 complex numbers S(z_j,z_{j+1},z_{j+2}), \\\\ j=1,...,n-2. The polygon bounds a convex set when all these shape components have imaginary components of the same sign.Rafael Artzy (1994) \\"Shapes of Polygons\\", Journal of Geometry 50(1‚Äì2):11‚Äì15  Human perception of shapes  Psychologists have theorized that humans mentally break down images into simple geometric shapes called geons.Marr, D., & Nishihara, H. (1978). Representation and recognition of the spatial organization of three-dimensional shapes. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, 200, 269-294. Examples of geons include cones and spheres. A wide range of other shape representations have also been investigated. Shape features seem to boil down to three basic dimensions: segmentability, compactness, and spikiness. There is also clear evidence that shapes guide human attention.

With a combined visual magnitude of +0.76, it is the brightest object in Crux and the 13th brightest star in the night sky. It is the southernmost first- magnitude star, 2.3 degrees more southerly than Alpha Centauri. To the naked eye Acrux appears as a single star, but it is actually a multiple star system containing six components. Through optical telescopes, Acrux appears as a triple star, whose two brightest components are visually separated by about 4 arcseconds and are known as Acrux A and Acrux B, Œ±1 Crucis and Œ±2 Crucis, or Œ± Crucis A and Œ± Crucis B. Both components are B-type stars, and are many times more massive and luminous than the Sun. Œ±1 Crucis is itself a spectroscopic binary with components designated Œ± Crucis Aa (officially named Acrux, historically the name of the entire system) and Œ± Crucis Ab. Its two component stars orbit every 76 days at a separation of about 1 astronomical unit (AU). HR 4729, also known as Acrux C, is a more distant companion, forming a triple star through small telescopes. C is also a spectroscopic binary, which brings the total number of stars in the system to at least five. Nomenclature The constellation Crux Œ± Crucis (Latinised to Alpha Crucis) is the system's Bayer designation; Œ±1 and Œ±2 Crucis, those of its two main components stars. The designations of these two constituents as Acrux A and Acrux B and those of A's components - Acrux Aa and Acrux Ab - derive from the convention used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for multiple star systems, and adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The historical name Acrux for Œ±1 Crucis is an \\"Americanism\\" coined in the 19th century, but entering common use only by the mid 20th century.Memoirs of the Rev. Walter M. Lowrie: missionary to China (1849), p. 93. Described as an \\"Americanism\\" in The Geographical Journal, vol. 92, Royal Geographical Society, 1938. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN states that in the case of multiple stars the name should be understood to be attributed to the brightest component by visual brightness. The WGSN approved the name Acrux for the star Acrux Aa on 20 July 2016 and it is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names. Since Acrux is at ‚àí63¬∞ declination, making it the southernmost first-magnitude star, it is only visible south of latitude 27¬∞ North. It barely rises from cities such as Miami, United States, or Karachi, Pakistan (both around 25¬∞N) and not at all from New Orleans, United States, or Cairo, Egypt (both about 30¬∞N). Because of Earth's axial precession, the star was visible to ancient Hindu astronomers in India who named it Tri-shanku. It was also visible to the ancient Romans and Greeks, who regarded it as part of the constellation of Centaurus.Richard Hinckley Allen, Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning, Dover Books, 1963.

This star is known as Estrela de Magalh√£es (\\"Star of Magellan\\") in Portuguese. Stellar properties HD 108250 The two components, Œ±1 and Œ±2 Crucis, are separated by 4 arcseconds. Œ±1 is magnitude 1.40 and Œ±2 is magnitude 2.09, both early class B stars, with surface temperatures of about 28,000 and 26,000 K respectively. Their luminosities are 25,000 and 16,000 times that of the Sun. Œ±1 and Œ±2 orbit over such a long period that motion is only barely seen. From their minimum separation of 430 astronomical units, the period is estimated to be around 1,500 years. Œ±1 is itself a spectroscopic binary star, with its components thought to be around 14 and 10 times the mass of the Sun and orbiting in only 76 days at a separation of about 1 AU. The masses of Œ±2 and the brighter component Œ±1 suggest that the stars will someday explode as supernovae. Component Ab may survive to become a massive white dwarf. Rizzuto and colleagues determined in 2011 that the Œ± Crucis system was 66% likely to be a member of the Lower Centaurus-Crux sub-group of the Scorpius-Centaurus Association. It was not previously seen to be a member of the group. The cooler less luminous B class star HR 4729 (HD 108250) lies 90 arcseconds away from triple star system Œ± Crucis and shares its motion through space, suggesting it may be gravitationally bound to it, and it is therefore generally assumed to be physically associated. It is itself a spectroscopic binary system, sometimes catalogued as component C (Acrux C) of the Acrux multiple system. Another fainter visual companion listed as component D or Acrux D. A further seven faint stars are also listed as companions out to a distance of about two arc-minutes. On 2008 October 2, the Cassini‚ÄìHuygens spacecraft resolved three of the components (A, B and C) of the multiple star system as Saturn's disk occulted it.Cassini \\"Kodak Moments\\" \\\\- Unmanned Spaceflight.com.

In Russian Ark, an unnamed narrator wanders through the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg, and implies that he died in some horrible accident and is a ghost drifting through the palace. In each room, he encounters various real and fictional people from various periods in the city's 300-year history. He is accompanied by \\"the European\\", who represents the Marquis de Custine, a 19th-century French traveler. The film was recorded entirely in the Winter Palace of the Russian State Hermitage Museum on 23 December 2001 using a one-take single 96-minute Steadicam sequence shot. Russian Ark uses the fourth wall device extensively, but repeatedly broken and re-erected. At times the narrator and the companion interact with the other performers, whilst at other times they pass unnoticed. The film was entered into the 2002 Cannes Film Festival.  Plot  On a winter's day, a small party of men and women arrive by horse-drawn carriage to a minor, side entrance of the Winter Palace, dressed in the style of the early 19th century to attend a ball hosted by the Emperor Alexander I. The narrator (whose point of view is always in first-person) meets another spectral but visible outsider, \\"the European\\", and follows him through numerous rooms of the palace. \\"The European\\", a 19th-century French diplomat who appears to be the Marquis de Custine, has nothing but contempt for Russians; he tells the narrator that they are unable to create or appreciate beauty as Europeans do, as demonstrated by the European treasures around him. Each room manifests a different period of Russian history, although the periods are not in chronological order. Featured are Peter the Great harassing and striking one of his generals; a spectacular presentation of operas and plays in the era of Catherine the Great; an imperial audience in which Tsar Nicholas I is offered a formal apology by the Shah of Iran for the death of ambassador Alexander Griboyedov in 1829; the idyllic family life of Tsar Nicholas II's children; the ceremonial changing of the various regiments of the Imperial Guard; people touring the palace in the present; the museum's director whispering the need to make repairs during the rule of Joseph Stalin; and a desperate Leningrader making his own coffin during the 900-day siege of the city during World War II. A grand ball follows, featuring music by Mikhail Glinka, with many of the participants in spectacular period costume, and a full orchestra conducted by Valery Gergiev, then a long final exit with a crowd down the grand staircase. The European tells the narrator that he belongs here, in the world of 1913 where everything is still beautiful and elegant, and does not want to go any further. The narrator then walks backwards out the hallway and sees many people from different time periods exiting the building together. As he watches them, the narrator quietly departs the procession, leaves the building through a side door and looks out upon an endless ocean.  Cast  * Alexander Sokurov as Narrator * Sergei Dontsov (Sergey Dreyden) as the European (Marquis de Custine) * Mariya Kuznetsova as Catherine the Great * Marksim Sergeyev as Peter the Great * Anna Aleksakhina as Alexandra Feodorovna * Vladimir Baranov as Nicholas II  Production  The film displays 33 rooms of the museum, which are filled with a cast of over 2,000 actors and three orchestras. Russian Ark was recorded in uncompressed high definition video using a Sony HDW-F900 camera. The information was not recorded compressed to tape as usual, but uncompressed onto a hard disk which could hold 100 minutes which was carried behind the cameraman as he traveled from room to room, scene to scene. According to In One Breath, the documentary on the making of the film, four attempts were made. The first failed at the five-minute mark. After two more failed attempts, they were left with only enough battery power for one final take. The four hours of daylight available were also nearly gone. Fortunately, the final take was a success and the film was completed at 90 minutes. Tilman B√ºttner, the director of photography and Steadicam operator, executed the shot on 23 December 2001. In a 2002 interview, B√ºttner said that film sound was recorded separately. \\"Every time I did the take, or someone else made a mistake, I would curse, and that would have gotten in, so we did the sound later.\\" Lighting directors of photography on the film were Bernd Fischer and Anatoli Radionov. The director later rejected B√ºttner's nomination for a European Film Academy award, believing that only the whole film should gain an award.  Post-production  In post-production the uncompressed HD 87-minute one-shot could be reworked in detail: besides many object removals, compositings, stabilisations, selective colour-corrections and digitally added focus changes, the whole film was continuously and dynamically reframed (resized) and for certain moments even timewarped (slowed down and sped up). Most of this was executed by editor/operator Patrick Wilfert under supervision of lead editor Sergei Ivanov on Discreet Logic's Inferno system and leaving the picture uncompressed, before being reprinted onto filmstock for theatrical distribution.  Background  The narrator's guide, \\"the European\\", is based on the book by the French aristocrat Marquis de Custine, who visited Russia in 1839 and wrote La Russie en 1839, in which he depicted Russia in extremely unflattering terms. A few biographical elements from Custine's life are shown in the film. Like the European, the Marquis' mother was friends with the Italian sculptor Canova and he himself was very religious. Custine's book mocks Russian civilization as a thin veneer of Europe on an Asiatic soul. For Custine, Europe was \\"civilization\\" while Asia was \\"barbarism\\", and his placing of Russia as a part of Asia rather than Europe was meant to deny that Russians had any sort of civilization worthy of the name. Echoing this sentiment, the film's European comments that Russia is a theater and that the people he meets are actors. The Marquis's family fortune came from a porcelain works, hence the European's interest in the S√®vres porcelain waiting for the diplomatic reception. At the end of the film, which depicts the last imperial ball in 1913, the European appears to accept Russia as a European nation. In One Breath, a documentary about the making of Russian Ark, written and directed by Knut Elstermann, gives more insight into the single long shot tracking techniques and formidable organization behind the making of the film.  Reception = Box office = The film was not a huge commercial success, though as an arthouse film it performed strongly in many territories. These include the UK, Japan, Korea, Argentina, and especially the US, where the film remains one of the most successful of both German and Russian movies of the last decades. Russian Ark is a German-Russian co-production. The film grossed $3,011,013 in the United States and Canada, with $3,674,735 internationally, for a worldwide total of $6,685,748. = Critical response = Russian Ark received high critical acclaim. Roger Ebert wrote, \\"Apart from anything else, this is one of the best-sustained ideas I have ever seen on the screen.... [T]he effect of the unbroken flow of images (experimented with in the past by directors like Hitchcock and Max Oph√ºls) is uncanny. If cinema is sometimes dreamlike, then every edit is an awakening. Russian Ark spins a daydream made of centuries.\\" Rotten Tomatoes reported that 90% of critics gave the film a positive review based on 105 reviews, with an average rating of 7.88/10. The consensus review summary reads, \\"As successful as it is ambitious, Russian Ark condenses three centuries of Russian history into a single, uninterrupted, 87-minute take.\\" On Metacritic, which uses an average of critics' reviews, the film has an 86/100 rating based on 32 reviews, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Slant Magazine ranked the film 84th in its list of the best films of the 2000s. In a critics' and readers' poll by Empire magazine, it was voted the 358th greatest film of all time.http://www.empireonline.com/500/27.asp = Awards = Russian Ark received the Visions Award at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival, a Special Citation at the 2003 San Francisco Film Critics Circle Awards and the 2004 Silver Condor Award for Best Foreign Film from the Argentine Film Critics Association; it was also nominated for the Palme d'Or at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival, the Golden Hugo at the 2002 Chicago International Film Festival and the 2004 Nika Award for Best Film. In addition, Alexander Sokurov was named Best Director at Fancine in 2003 and was nominated for the 2002 European Film Award for Best Director. Cinematographer Tilman B√ºttner was also nominated for various awards for his work on the film, including a European Film Award and a German Camera Award.

Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation (2nd edition). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. 497 p Marshes can often be found at the edges of lakes and streams, where they form a transition between the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. They are often dominated by grasses, rushes or reeds. If woody plants are present they tend to be low-growing shrubs, and then sometimes called carrs. This form of vegetation is what differentiates marshes from other types of wetland such as swamps, which are dominated by trees, and mires, which are wetlands that have accumulated deposits of acidic peat. Basic information White water lilies are a typical marsh plant in European areas of deeper water. Many kinds of birds nest in marshes; this one is a yellow-headed blackbird. Marshes provide a habitat for many species of plants, animals, and insects that have adapted to living in flooded conditions. The plants must be able to survive in wet mud with low oxygen levels. Many of these plants, therefore, have aerenchyma, channels within the stem that allow air to move from the leaves into the rooting zone. Marsh plants also tend to have rhizomes for underground storage and reproduction. Common examples include cattails, sedges, papyrus and sawgrass. Aquatic animals, from fish to salamanders, are generally able to live with a low amount of oxygen in the water. Some can obtain oxygen from the air instead, while others can live indefinitely in conditions of low oxygen. Marshes provide habitats for many kinds of invertebrates, fish, amphibians, waterfowl and aquatic mammals. Marshes have extremely high levels of biological production, some of the highest in the world, and therefore are important in supporting fisheries. Marshes also improve water quality by acting as a sink to filter pollutants and sediment from the water that flows through them. Marshes (and other wetlands) are able to absorb water during periods of heavy rainfall and slowly release it into waterways and therefore reduce the magnitude of flooding. The pH in marshes tends to be neutral to alkaline, as opposed to bogs, where peat accumulates under more acid conditions. Types of marshes A salt marsh in Scotland Marshes differ depending mainly on their location and salinity. Both of these factors greatly influence the range and scope of animal and plant life that can survive and reproduce in these environments. The three main types of marsh are salt marshes, freshwater tidal marshes, and freshwater marshes. These three can be found worldwide and each contains a different set of organisms. =Salt marshes= Saltwater marshes are found around the world in mid to high latitudes, wherever there are sections of protected coastline. They are located close enough to the shoreline that the motion of the tides affects them, and, sporadically, they are covered with water. They flourish where the rate of sediment buildup is greater than the rate at which the land level is sinking. Salt marshes are dominated by specially adapted rooted vegetation, primarily salt-tolerant grasses.Keddy, P.A. 2010. Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation (2nd edition). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. 497 p. Salt marshes are most commonly found in lagoons, estuaries, and on the sheltered side of shingle or sandspit. The currents there carry the fine particles around to the quiet side of the spit and sediment begins to build up. These locations allow the marshes to absorb the excess nutrients from the water running through them before they reach the oceans and estuaries. These marshes are slowly declining. Coastal development and urban sprawl has caused significant loss of these essential habitats.B.R. Silliman, E.D. Grosholz, and M.D. Bertness (eds.) 2009. Human Impacts on Salt Marshes. A Global Perspective. University of California Press, Berkeley, California. =Freshwater tidal marshes= Although considered a freshwater marsh, this form of marsh is affected by the ocean tides. However, without the stresses of salinity at work in its saltwater counterpart, the diversity of the plants and animals that live in and use freshwater tidal marshes is much higher than in salt marshes. The most serious threats to this form of marsh are the increasing size and pollution of the cities surrounding them. =Freshwater marshes= A wet meadow adjacent to Big Bear Lake, San Bernardino Mountains, California Ranging greatly in both size and geographic location, freshwater marshes make up the most common form of wetland in North America. They are also the most diverse of the three types of marsh. Some examples of freshwater marsh types in North America are: Wet meadows Wet meadows occur in areas such as shallow lake basins, low-lying depressions, and the land between shallow marshes and upland areas. They also occur on the edges of large lakes and rivers. Wet meadows often have very high plant diversity and high densities of buried seeds.Keddy, P.A. and A. A. Reznicek. 1986. Great Lakes vegetation dynamics: the role of fluctuating water levels and buried seeds. Journal of Great Lakes Research 12: 25-36. They are regularly flooded but are often dry in the summer. Vernal pools Vernal pools are a type of marsh found only seasonally in shallow depressions in the land. They can be covered in shallow water, but in the summer and fall, they can be completely dry. In western North America, vernal pools tend to form in open grasslands,Bauder, E. T. 1989. Drought stress and competition effects on the local distribution of Pogogyne abramsii. Ecology 70: 1083‚Äì9. whereas in the east they often occur in forested landscapes.Calhoun, A.J.K. and P.G. deMaynadier. 2008. Science and the Conservation of Vernal Pools in Northeastern North America. CRC Press, Boca Raton, Florida. Further south, vernal pools form in pine savannas and flatwoods. Many amphibian species depend upon vernal pools for spring breeding; these ponds provide habitat free from fish which eat the eggs and young of amphibians. An example is the endangered gopher frog (Rana sevosa).Richter, S. C. and Seigel, R. A. 2002. Annual variation in the population ecology of the endangered gopher frog, Rana sevosa Goin and Netting. Copeia, 2002, 962‚Äì72. Similar temporary ponds occur in other world ecosystems, where they may have local names. However, the term vernal pool can be applied to all such temporary pool ecosystems. Playa lakes Playa lakes are a form of shallow freshwater marsh that occurs in the southern high plains of the United States.Smith, L. M. 2003. Playas of the Great Plains. Austin, TX: University of Texas Press. Like vernal pools, they are only present at certain times of the year and generally have a circular shape. As the playa dries during the summer, conspicuous plant zonation develops along the shoreline.Bolen, E. G., Smith, L. M., and Schramm, H. L., Jr. 1989.

These landscapes were once covered by glaciers, and as a result shallow depressions were formed in great numbers. These depressions fill with water in the spring. They provide important breeding habitats for many species of waterfowl. Some pools only occur seasonally while others retain enough water to be present all year.van der Valk, A. G. 1989. Northern Prairie Wetlands. Ames, IA: Iowa State University Press. = Riverine wetlands = Many kinds of marsh occur along the fringes of large rivers. The different types are produced by factors such as water level, nutrients, ice scour, and waves.Day, R., P.A. Keddy, J. McNeill and T. Carleton. 1988. Fertility and disturbance gradients: a summary model for riverine marsh vegetation. Ecology 69: 1044-1054 =Embanked marshlands= Large tracts of tidal marsh have been embanked and artificially drained. They are usually known by the Dutch name of polders. In Northern Germany and Scandinavia they are called Marschland, Marsch or marsk, in France marais maritime. In the Netherlands and Belgium they are designated as marine clay districts. In East-Anglia the embanked marshes are also known as Fens. Restoration Some areas of the world have already lost 90% of their wetlands, including marshes. They have been drained to create agricultural land or filled to accommodate urban sprawl. Restoration is the process of returning marshes to the landscape to replace those lost in the past. Restoration can be done on a large scale, such as by allowing rivers to flood naturally in the spring, or on a small scale by returning wetlands to urban landscapes.

During her childhood, she attended school in nearby Beaminster, where she received guitar lessons from folk singer-songwriter Steve Knightley, and her parents introduced her to music that would later influence her work, including blues music, Captain Beefheart and Bob Dylan. Her parents were avid music fans and regularly arranged get-togethers and small gigs; among their oldest friends was Ian Stewart. As a teenager, Harvey began learning saxophone and joined an eight- piece instrumental group Bologne, based in Dorset run by composer Andrew Dickson. She was also a guitarist with folk duo the Polekats, with whom she wrote some of her earliest material. After finishing school, Harvey attended Yeovil College and attended a visual arts foundation course.Harvey, PJ. \\"I always painted and have always drawn. I initially came from the visual arts background before I even began music.\\" Extract from a transcription of an interview with Miranda Sawyer on The Culture Show. Broadcast on BBC Two on 10 February 2011. Music career=Automatic Dlamini: 1988‚Äì1991= In July 1988, Harvey became a member of Automatic Dlamini, a band based in Bristol with whom she gained extensive ensemble-playing experience. Formed by John Parish in 1983, the band consisted of a rotating line-up that at various times included Rob Ellis and Ian Oliver. Harvey had met Parish in 1987 through mutual friend Jeremy Hogg, the band's slide guitarist. Providing saxophone, guitars and background vocals, she travelled extensively during the band's early days, including performances in East and West Germany, Spain and Poland to support the band's debut studio album, The D is for Drum. A second European tour took place throughout June and July 1989. Following the tour, the band recorded Here Catch, Shouted His Father, their second studio album, between late 1989 and early 1990. This is the only Automatic Dlamini material to feature Harvey, but remains unreleased, although bootleg versions of the album are in circulation. In January 1991, Harvey left to form her own band with former bandmates Ellis and Oliver; yet she had formed lasting personal and professional relationships with certain members, especially Parish, whom she has referred to as her \\"musical soulmate.\\" Parish would subsequently contribute to, and sometimes co-produce, Harvey's solo studio albums and has toured with her a number of times. As a duo, Parish and Harvey have recorded two collaborative albums where Parish composed the music and Harvey penned the lyrics. Additionally, Parish's girlfriend in the late 1980s was photographer Maria Mochnacz. She and Harvey became close friends and Mochnacz went on to shoot and design most of Harvey's album artwork and music videos, contributing significantly to her public image. Harvey has said of her time with Automatic Dlamini: \\"I ended up not singing very much but I was just happy to learn how to play the guitar. I wrote a lot during the time I was with them but my first songs were crap. I was listening to a lot of Irish folk music at the time, so the songs were folky and full of penny whistles and stuff. It was ages before I felt ready to perform my own songs in front of other people.\\" She also credits Parish for teaching her how to perform in front of audiences, saying \\"after the experience with John's band and seeing him perform I found it was enormously helpful to me as a performer to engage with people in the audience, and I probably did learn that from him, amongst other things.\\" =PJ Harvey Trio; Dry and Rid of Me: 1991‚Äì1993= In January 1991, following her departure from Automatic Dlamini, Harvey formed her own band with former bandmates Rob Ellis and Ian Oliver. Harvey decided to name the trio PJ Harvey after rejecting other names as \\"nothing felt right at all or just suggested the wrong type of sound\\",Harvey, PJ. \\"We were playing around with other names but nothing felt right at all or just suggested the wrong type of sound or just wasn't right. And I also felt I am the songwriter in the band and I know that I'm going to be wanting to write songs and continue making music for quite a while but I can't guarantee that Rob and Steve will want to.\\" Extracts from a transcription of an interview with PJ Harvey on 120 Minutes. Broadcast on MTV on 20 June 1993. and also to allow her to continue music as a solo artist. The trio consisted of Harvey on vocals and guitars, Ellis on drums and backing vocals, and Oliver on bass. Oliver later departed to rejoin the still-active Automatic Dlamini. He was subsequently replaced with Steve Vaughan. The trio's \\"disastrous\\" debut performance was held at a skittle alley in Charmouth Village Hall in April 1991. Harvey later recounted the event saying: \\"we started playing and I suppose there was about fifty people there, and during the first song we cleared the hall. There was only about two people left. And a woman came up to us, came up to my drummer, it was only a three piece, while we were playing and shouted at him 'Don't you realise nobody likes you! We'll pay you, you can stop playing, we'll still pay you!'\\"N.B. User must click \\"Listen\\" or \\"Download\\" to access MP3 stream. The band relocated to London in June 1991 when Harvey applied to study sculpture at Central Saint Martins College of Art & Design, still undecided as to her future career. During this time, the band recorded a set of demo songs and distributed them to record labels. Independent label Too Pure agreed to release the band's debut single \\"Dress\\" in October 1991, and later signed PJ Harvey. \\"Dress\\" received mass critical acclaim upon its release and was voted Single of the Week in Melody Maker by guest reviewer John Peel, who admired \\"the way Polly Jean seems crushed by the weight of her own songs and arrangements, as if the air is literally being sucked out of them ... admirable if not always enjoyable.\\" However, Too Pure provided little promotion for the single and critics claim that \\"Melody Maker had more to do with the success of the \\"Dress\\" single than Too Pure Records.\\" A week after its release, the band recorded a live radio session for Peel on BBC Radio 1 on 29 October featuring \\"Oh, My Lover\\", \\"Victory\\", \\"Sheela-Na-Gig\\" and \\"Water\\". The following February, the trio released \\"Sheela-Na-Gig\\" as their equally-acclaimed second single and their debut studio album, Dry (1992), followed in March. Like the singles preceding it, Dry received an overwhelming international critical response. The album was cited by Kurt Cobain of Nirvana as his sixteenth-favourite album ever in his posthumously-published Journals. Rolling Stone also named Harvey as Songwriter of the Year N.B. User must select \\"Click to Read\\" on the Biography section. and Best New Female Singer. A limited edition double LP version of Dry was released alongside the regular version of the album, containing both the original and demo versions of each track, called Dry Demonstration, and the band also received significant coverage at the Reading Festival in 1992. Island (PolyGram) signed the trio amid a major label bidding war in mid-1992, and in December 1992 the trio travelled to Cannon Falls, Minnesota in the United States to record the follow-up to Dry with producer Steve Albini. Prior to recording with Albini, the band recorded a second session with John Peel on 22 September and recorded a version of Bob Dylan's \\"Highway 61 Revisited,\\" and two new songs \\"Me Jane\\" and \\"Ecstasy.\\" The recording sessions with Albini took place at Pachyderm Recording Studio and resulted in the band's major label debut Rid of Me in May 1993. Rolling Stone wrote that it \\"is charged with aggressive eroticism and rock fury. It careens from blues to goth to grunge, often in the space of a single song.\\" The album was promoted by two singles, \\"50ft Queenie\\" and \\"Man-Size\\", as well as tours of the United Kingdom in May and of the United States in June, continuing there during the summer. However, during the American leg of the tour, internal friction started to form between the members of the trio. Deborah Frost, writing for Rolling Stone, noticed \\"an ever widening personal gulf\\" between the band members, and quoted Harvey as saying \\"It makes me sad. I wouldn't have got here without them. I needed them back then ‚Äì badly. But I don't need them anymore. We all changed as people.\\" Despite the tour's personal downsides, footage from live performances was compiled and released on the long-form video Reeling with PJ Harvey (1993). The band's final tour was to support U2 in August 1993, after which the trio officially disbanded. In her final appearance on American television in September 1993 on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Harvey performed a solo version of \\"Rid of Me.\\" As Rid of Me sold substantially more copies than Dry, 4-Track Demos, a compilation album of demos for the album was released in October and inaugurated her career as a solo artist. In early 1994, it was announced that U2's manager, Paul McGuinness, had become her manager. =Solo career: 1993‚Äìpresent=To Bring You My Love and Is This Desire?: 1993‚Äì1999 As Harvey embarked on her solo career, she explored collaborations with other musicians. In 1995 she released her third studio album, To Bring You My Love, featuring former bandmate John Parish, Bad Seeds multi-instrumentalist Mick Harvey and French drummer Jean-Marc Butty, all of whom would continue to perform and record with Harvey throughout her career. The album was also her first material to be produced by Flood. Simultaneously a more blues-influenced and more futuristic record than its predecessors, To Bring You My Love showcased Harvey broadening her musical style to include strings, organs and synthesisers. Rolling Stone said in its review that \\"Harvey sings the blues like Nick Cave sings gospel: with more distortion, sex and murder than you remember. To Bring You My Love was a towering goth version of grunge.\\" During the successive tours for the album, Harvey also experimented with her image and stage persona. PJ Harvey 1998 in Cologne/Germany The record generated a surprise modern rock radio hit in the United States with its lead single, \\"Down by the Water.\\" Three consecutive singles‚Äî\\"C'mon Billy\\", \\"Send His Love to Me\\" and \\"Long Snake Moan\\"‚Äîwere also moderately successful. The album was a commercial success selling one million copies worldwide including 370,000 in the United States. It was also certified Silver in the United Kingdom within seven months of its release, having sold over 60,000 copies. In the United States, the album was voted Album of the Year by The Village Voice, Rolling Stone, USA Today, People, The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times. Rolling Stone also named Harvey 1995's Artist of the Year and Spin ranked the album third in The 90 Greatest Albums of the 1990s, behind Nirvana's Nevermind (1991) and Public Enemy's Fear of a Black Planet (1990). In July 2020, a vinyl reissue of To Bring You My Love was announced which includes unreleased demos. https://pitchfork.com/news/pj- harvey-announces-to-bring-you-my-love-vinyl-reissue/ In 1996, following the international success of To Bring You My Love and other collaborations, Harvey began composing material that would end up on her fourth studio album, during what she referred to as \\"an incredibly low patch.\\" The material diverged significantly from her former work and introduced electronica elements into her song-writing. During recording sessions in 1997 original PJ Harvey Trio drummer Rob Ellis rejoined Harvey's band, and Flood was hired again as producer. The sessions, which continued into April the following year, resulted in Is This Desire? (1998). Though originally released to mixed reviews in September 1998, the album was a success and received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Alternative Music Performance. The album's lead single, \\"A Perfect Day Elise,\\" was moderately successful in the United Kingdom, peaking at number 25 on the UK Singles Chart, her most successful single to date. Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea and Uh Huh Her: 2000‚Äì2006 In early 2000, Harvey began work on her fifth studio album Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea with Rob Ellis and Mick Harvey. Written in her native Dorset, Paris and New York, the album showcased a more mainstream indie rock and pop rock sound to her previous albums and the lyrics followed themes of love that tied into Harvey's affection for New York City. The album also featured Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke on three tracks, including his lead vocals on \\"This Mess We're in.\\" Upon its release in October 2000 the album was a critical and commercial success, selling over one million copies worldwide and charting in both the United Kingdom and the United States. The album's three singles‚Äî\\"Good Fortune\\", \\"A Place Called Home\\" and \\"This Is Love\\"‚Äîwere moderately successful. Harvey performing live in 2004 The album also received a number of accolades including a BRIT Award nomination for Best Female Artist and two Grammy Award nominations for Best Rock Album and Best Female Rock Performance for the album's third single, \\"This Is Love\\". However, most notably, Harvey was nominated for, and won, the 2001 Mercury Music Prize. The awards ceremony was held on the same day as the September 11 attacks on the United States and Harvey was on tour in Washington, D.C., one of the affected cities, when she won the prize. Reflecting on the win in 2011, she said: \\"quite naturally I look back at that and only remember the events that were taking place across the world and to win the prize on that day‚Äîit didn't have much importance in the grand scheme of things\\", noting \\"it was a very surreal day\\". The same year, Harvey also topped a readers' poll conducted by Q Magazine of the 100 Greatest Women in Rock Music. During three years of various collaborations with other artists, Harvey was also working on her sixth studio album, Uh Huh Her, which was released in May 2004. For the first time since 4-Track Demos (1993), Harvey played every instrument‚Äîwith the exception of drums provided by Rob Ellis‚Äîand was the sole producer. The album received \\"generally favourable reviews\\" by critics, though its production was often criticised. It was also a commercial success, debuting and peaking at number 12 in the UK Albums Chart and being certified Silver by the BPI within a month of its release. Harvey also did an extensive world tour in promotion of the album, lasting seven months in total. Selected recordings from the tour were included on Harvey's first live DVD, On Tour: Please Leave Quietly, directed by Maria Mochnacz and released in 2006. White Chalk and Let England Shake: 2007‚Äì2014 Harvey performing live during the White Chalk tour in 2007 During her first performance since the Uh Huh Her tour at the Hay Festival of Literature & Arts on 26 May 2006, Harvey revealed that her next studio album would be almost entirely piano-based. Following the October release of The Peel Sessions 1991‚Äì2004, a compilation of songs recorded from 1991 to 2000 during her radio sessions with John Peel, she began recording her seventh studio album White Chalk in November, together with Flood, John Parish and Eric Drew Feldman and drummer Jim White in a studio in West London. White Chalk was released in September 2007 and marked a radical departure from her usual alternative rock style, consisting mainly of piano ballads. The album received favourable reviews, its style being described by one critic as containing \\"pseudo-Victorian elements‚Äîdrama, restraint, and antiquated instruments and sounds.\\" Harvey herself said of the album: \\"when I listen to the record I feel in a different universe, really, and I'm not sure whether it's in the past or in the future. The record confuses me, that's what I like‚Äîit doesn't feel of this time right now, but I'm not sure whether it's 100 years ago or 100 years in the future\\", summing up the album's sound as \\"really weird.\\" During the tour for the album Harvey performed without a backing band, and also began performing on an autoharp, which continues to be her primary instrument after guitar and has influenced her material since White Chalk. In April 2010, Harvey appeared on The Andrew Marr Show to perform a new song titled \\"Let England Shake.\\" In a pre-performance interview with Marr, she stated that the new material she had written had been \\"formed out of the landscape that I've grown up in and the history of this nation\\" and as \\"a human being affected by politics.\\"Harvey, PJ. \\"I know that the music that I make is definitely formed out of the landscape that I've grown up in and the history of this nation\\" and \\"I sing as a human being affected by politics and that for me is a more successful way in song.\\" Extracts from a transcription of an interview with PJ Harvey on The Andrew Marr Show. Broadcast on BBC One on 18 April 2010. Her eighth studio album Let England Shake was released in February 2011, and received universal critical acclaim. NMEs 10/10 review summarised the album as \\"a record that ventures deep into the heart of darkness of war itself and its resonance throughout England's past, present and future\\" and other reviews also noted its themes and writing style as \\"bloody and forceful,\\" mixing \\"ethereal form with brutal content,\\" and \\"her most powerful.\\" Dealing with the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan and other episodes from English history, the album featured John Parish, Mick Harvey and Jean-Marc Butty as Harvey's backing band and the quartet toured extensively in its promotion. Following the release of the album's two well-received singles‚Äî\\"The Words That Maketh Murder\\" and \\"The Glorious Land\\"‚Äîand the collection of short films by Seamus Murphy to accompany the album, Harvey won her second Mercury Music Prize on 6 September. The award marked her as the first artist to receive the award twice, entering her into The Guinness Book of Records as the only artist to have achieved this., and sales of Let England Shake increased 1,190% overnight following her win. On 23 September, Let England Shake was certified Gold in the United Kingdom and was listed as album of the year by MOJO and Uncut. On 3 August 2013, Harvey released a song Shaker Aamer in support of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp detainee by the same name who was the last British citizen to be held there. The song describes in detail what Aamer endured during his four-month hunger strike. The Hope Six Demolition Project: 2015‚Äìpresent On 16 January 2015, PJ Harvey began recording her 9th studio album in front of a live audience. A custom built recording studio was made in London's Somerset House. Uncut magazine noted that much like her previous album Let England Shake, many of the lyrics were politically charged, but this time it was more globally focused. While recording she was shown to be using saxophones, an autoharp and a bouzouki. Flood was confirmed to be the producer of the album. On 18 December 2015, Harvey released a 20-second teaser for the album, which contained a release date of spring 2016. On 21 January 2016, the debut single, \\"The Wheel\\", and the name of the album, The Hope Six Demolition Project, were announced on Steve Lamacq's show on BBC Radio 6 Music. The album's release date was also revealed to be 15 April. A new video, \\"The Orange Monkey\\", was shared on 2 June 2016. Directed by Irish filmmaker Seamus Murphy, it was made from footage of Murphy's and Harvey's trips to Afghanistan. The album reached #1 on the UK Albums Chart and was nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best Alternative Music Album category. Harvey spent much of 2016 and 2017 touring the world with her nine-piece band, taking her critically lauded live show around North America, South America, Europe and Australasia. Collaborations and projects John Parish and Harvey performing live in 2009. Parish ‚Äì whom Harvey describes as her \\"musical soulmate\\" ‚Äì has been working with Harvey for over 20 years.Besides her own work, Harvey has also collaborated with a number of other artists. In 1995, she recorded a duet of American folk song \\"Henry Lee\\" with partner Nick Cave and also featured on the Bob Dylan cover \\"Death is Not the End,\\" both released on Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds' Murder Ballads (1996). In the same year she sang the theme song \\"Who Will Love Me Now?\\" on Philip Ridley's film The Passion of Darkly Noon. After her 1995 tour, she met Pascal Comelade and decided to collaborate with him, singing on several tracks including \\"Love too Soon\\" on his L'Argot du Bruit album.Frost, Deborah 2004 In May 1998, before the release of Is This Desire?, she featured on Tricky's Angels with Dirty Faces, performing lead vocals on \\"Broken Homes\\", and also contributed to Sparklehorse's 2001 album It's a Wonderful Life performing guitar, piano and background vocals on two songs, \\"Eyepennies\\" and \\"Piano Fire.\\" Following the tour in promotion of Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea, she contributed vocals to eight tracks on Volume 9: I See You Hearin' Me and Volume 10: I Heart Disco by Josh Homme's side project The Desert Sessions, also appearing in the music video for \\"Crawl Home.\\" Throughout 2004, Harvey produced Tiffany Anders' album Funny Cry Happy Gift, and also produced, performed on and wrote five songs for Marianne Faithfull's album Before the Poison,; and contributed background vocals on \\"Hit the City,\\" \\"Methamphetamine Blues\\" and \\"Come to Me\\" on Mark Lanegan's album Bubblegum. Harvey contributed the song \\"Slow-Motion Movie-Star\\", an outtake from Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea, to Mick Harvey's fourth studio album, Two of Diamonds, released in 2007. Harvey has also recorded two studio albums with long-time collaborator John Parish. Dance Hall at Louse Point (1996) was written collectively with Parish with the exception of the song \\"Is That All There Is?\\", written by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. The album also listed her as Polly Jean Harvey, which in part affected the album's sales. Harvey has also reflected on how the album was \\"an enormous turning point\\" and \\"lyrically, it moved me into areas I'd never been to before.\\" In 1998, she also performed lead vocals on \\"Airplane Blues,\\" as a soundtrack accompaniment to the Wingwalkers art exhibition by Rebecca Goddard and Parish's wife, Michelle Henning, which was released as the closing song on Parish's second solo album How Animals Move in 2002. Following the release of White Chalk, Harvey reunited with Parish to record A Woman a Man Walked By, released in March 2009. Like Dance Hall at Louse Point, the album received positive reviews but also was a moderate commercial success, peaking at number 25 in the UK Albums Chart. She collaborated with Egyptian artist Ramy Essam on \\"The Camp\\", a charity single released in June 2017 to benefit displaced children in the Lebanese Bekaa Valley fleeing the Syrian Civil War. Aside from collaborations, Harvey has also embarked on a number of projects as a composer. In January 2009, a new stage production of Henrik Ibsen's Hedda Gabler opened on Broadway. Directed by Ian Rickson and starring Mary-Louise Parker in the title role, the play featured an original score of incidental music written by Harvey. In November 2011, Harvey also composed part of the score for the Young Vic's long-running production of Hamlet in London. In May 2012, Harvey composed two songs, \\"Horse\\" and \\"Bobby Don't Steal,\\" for Mark Cousins' film What is This Film Called Love?, which also features \\"To Bring You My Love.\\" In March 2018, PJ Harvey and John Parish released a song called \\"Sorry For Your Loss\\" as tribute to singer-songwriter Mark Linkous, who committed suicide in 2010. In 2019, Harvey composed the score for Shane Meadows‚Äô miniseries, The Virtues, broadcast on Channel 4. Musical style and influences Harvey possesses an expansive contralto vocal range. Harvey dislikes repeating herself in her music, resulting in very different-sounding albums. In an October 2004 interview with Rolling Stone, she said: \\"when I'm working on a new record, the most important thing is to not repeat myself ... that's always my aim: to try and cover new ground and really to challenge myself. Because I'm in this for learning.\\" While her musical style has been described as alternative rock, punk blues, art rock, and avant-rock, she has experimented with various other genres including electronica, indie rock and folk music. She is also known for changing her physical appearance for each album by altering her mode of dress or hairstyle, creating a unique aesthetic that extends to all aspects of the album, from the album art to the live performances. She works closely with friend and photographer Maria Mochnacz to develop the visual style of each album. Around the time of To Bring You My Love, for example, Harvey began experimenting with her image and adopting a theatrical aspect to her live performances. Her former fashion style, which consisted of simple black leggings, turtleneck sweaters and Doc Martens boots, was replaced by ballgowns, catsuits, wigs and excessive make-up. She also began using stage props like a Ziggy Stardust-style flashlight microphone. She denied the influence of drag, Kabuki or performance art on her new image, a look she affectionately dubbed \\"Joan Crawford on acid\\" in an interview with Spin in 1996, but admitted that \\"it's that combination of being quite elegant and funny and revolting, all at the same time, that appeals to me. I actually find wearing make-up like that, sort of smeared around, as extremely beautiful. Maybe that's just my twisted sense of beauty.\\" However, she later told Dazed & Confused magazine, \\"that was kind of a mask. It was much more of a mask than I've ever had. I was very lost as a person, at that point. I had no sense of self left at all\\", and has never repeated the overt theatricality of the To Bring You My Love tour. At an early age, she was introduced by her parents to blues music, jazz and art rock, which, she told Rolling Stone in 1995, would later influence her: \\"I was brought up listening to John Lee Hooker, to Howlin' Wolf, to Robert Johnson, and a lot of Jimi Hendrix and Captain Beefheart. So I was exposed to all these very compassionate musicians at a very young age, and that's always remained in me and seems to surface more as I get older. I think the way we are as we get older is a result of what we knew when we were children.\\" During her teenage years, she began listening to new wave and synthpop bands such as Soft Cell, Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet, although later stated that it was a phase when she was \\"having a bit of a rebellion against my parents' record collection.\\" In her later teenage years, she became a fan of American indie rock bands including Pixies, Television and Slint (whom she reached out to when the band included a message in the inside sleeve of Spiderland saying \\"interested female vocalists write 1864 Douglas Blvd., Louisville, KY 40205\\"). Though not as many critics have suspected, Patti Smith; a frequent comparison that Harvey dismisses as \\"lazy journalism.\\" However, recently Harvey has said that Smith is \\"so energising to see and so passionate with what she's doing\\".Harvey, PJ. \\"Patti Smith, whenever she's performing I want to see her because so energising to see and so passionate with what she's doing.\\" Extracts from a transcription of an interview with PJ Harvey in The Guardian. Released online on 12 September 2011. Harvey has also cited Siouxsie Sioux in terms of live performance, stating : \\"She is so exciting to watch, so full of energy and human raw quality\\". She has also drawn inspiration from Russian folk music, Italian soundtrack composer Ennio Morricone, classical composers like Arvo P√§rt, Samuel Barber and Henryk G√≥recki; and Neil Young. As a lyricist, Harvey has cited numerous poets, authors and lyricists as influences on her work including Harold Pinter, T. S. Eliot, William Butler Yeats, James Joyce, Ted Hughes and contemporaries such as Shane MacGowan and Jez Butterworth. Other ventures Outside her better-known music career, Harvey is also an occasional artist and actress. In 1998, she appeared in Hal Hartley's film The Book of Life as Magdalena‚Äîa modern-day character based on the Biblical Mary Magdalene‚Äîand had a cameo role as a Playboy Bunny in A Bunny Girl's Tale, a short film directed by Sarah Miles, in which she also performs \\"Nina in Ecstasy\\", an outtake from Is This Desire? (1998). Harvey also collaborated with Miles on another film, Amaeru Fallout 1972, which includes Harvey performing a cover of \\"When Will I See You Again.\\" Harvey is also an accomplished sculptor who has had several pieces exhibited at the Lamont Gallery and the Bridport Arts Centre. In 2010, she was invited to be the guest designer for the summer issue of Francis Ford Coppola's literary magazine Zoetrope: All-Story. The issue featured Harvey's paintings and drawings alongside short stories by Woody Allen. Speaking of her artistic contributions to the magazine in 2011, Harvey said: \\"the first opportunity I ever had to show any work was in this magazine. They were drawn while I was writing and recording the record (Let England Shake). It does relate to the record in the way the cycle keeps happening.\\"Harvey, PJ. \\"The first opportunity I ever had to show any work was in this magazine. They were drawn while I was writing and recording the record (Let England Shake). It does relate to the record in the way the cycle keeps happening.\\" Extracts from a transcription of an interview with PJ Harvey on The Culture Show. Broadcast on BBC Two on 12 February 2011. In December 2013, Harvey gave her debut public poetry reading at the British Library. On 2 January 2014, she guest-edited BBC Radio 4's Today programme. In October 2015, Harvey published her first collection of poetry, a collaboration with photographer Seamus Murphy, entitled The Hollow of The Hand. To create the book, PJ Harvey and Seamus Murphy made several journeys to Kosovo, Afghanistan and Washington, D.C. Their experiences were documented in Seamus Murphy's film \\"A Dog Called Money\\", due to be released in UK cinemas and online on 8 November 2019. Seamus Murphy had previously worked with PJ Harvey to create 12 Short Films for Let England Shake. Personal life She rejects the notion that her song lyrics are autobiographical, telling The Times in 1998: \\"the tortured artist myth is rampant. People paint me as some kind of black witchcraft-practising devil from hell, that I have to be twisted and dark to do what I am doing. It's a load of rubbish\\". What is more, she later told Spin: \\"some critics have taken my writing so literally to the point that they'll listen to 'Down by the Water' and believe I have actually given birth to a child and drowned her.\\" In the early 1990s, Harvey was romantically involved with drummer and photographer Joe Dilworth.Lindsay Baker, \\"Let there Be Light: Interview with Polly Harvey\\", The Guardian, 21 October 2000. From 1996 to 1997, following their musical collaborations, Harvey had a relationship with Nick Cave, and their subsequent break-up influenced Cave's follow-up studio album The Boatman's Call (1997), with songs such as \\"Into My Arms,\\" \\"West Country Girl\\" and \\"Black Hair\\" being written specifically about her. Harvey has one older brother, Saul, and four nephews through him. She expressed a fondness for children in 1995 and stated that she would love to have them, saying: \\"I wouldn't consider it unless I was married. I would have to meet someone that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. That's the only person who I would want to be the father of my children. Maybe that will never happen.

Romantic affair The Stolen Kiss by Jean-Honor√© Fragonard A romantic affair, also called an affair of the heart, may refer to sexual liaisons among unwed or wedded parties, or to various forms of nonmonogamy. Unlike a casual relationship, which is a physical and emotional relationship between two people who may have sex without expecting a more formal romantic relationship, an affair is by its nature romantic. The term \\"affair\\" may also describe part of an agreement within an open marriage or open relationship, such as swinging, dating, or polyamory, in which some forms of sex with one's non-primary partner(s) are permitted and other forms are not. Participants in open relationships, including unmarried couples and polyamorous families, may consider sanctioned affairs the norm, but when a non-sanctioned affair occurs, it is described as infidelity and may be experienced as adultery, or a betrayal both of trust and integrity, even though to most people it would not be considered \\"illicit\\". When romantic affairs lack both overt and covert sexual behavior, yet exhibits intense or enduring emotional intimacy, it may also be referred to as an emotional affair, platonic love, or a romantic friendship.  Extramarital affair  Extramarital affairs are relationships outside of marriage where an illicit romantic or sexual relationship or a romantic friendship or passionate attachment occurs. An affair that continues in one form or another for years, even as one of the partners to that affair passes through marriage, divorce and remarriage. This could be considered the primary relationship, with the marriage secondary to it. Several people claim the reason of extra marital affair is their unsuccessful marriage where both spouses fail to please each other. This may be serial polygamy or other forms of nonmonogamy. The ability to pursue serial and clandestine extramarital affairs while safeguarding other secrets and conflict of interest inherent in the practice, requires skill in deception and duplicitous negotiation. Even to hide one affair requires a degree of skill or malicious gaslighting. All these behaviors are more usually called lying. Deception can be defined as the \\"covert manipulation of perception to alter thoughts, feelings, or beliefs\\". The presence of deception may indicate the degree to which the deceiver has breached fundamental conditions of fidelity, of reciprocal vulnerability and of transparency. Sometimes these are explicit or assumed pre-conditions of a committed intimate relationship. Individuals having affairs with married men or women can be prosecuted for adultery in some jurisdictions and can be sued by the jilted spouses in others, or named as 'co-respondent' in divorce proceedings. As of 2009, eight U.S. states permitted such alienation of affections lawsuits.Affairs with consent of their significant others may not be considered infidelity or adultery. Online affair The appearance of computer-mediated communication introduces a new type of communication and consequently a new type of \\"affair\\". There are various kinds of computer- mediated communication that differ in some significant aspects: one-to-one or group communication formats, interrelating with anonymous or identified people, and communicating in synchronous or asynchronous formats. Online affairs combine features of close and remote relationships. Ben Ze'ef argues that an online affair is a unique kind of affair‚Äîtermed \\"detached attachment\\", or just \\"detachment\\"‚Äîthat includes opposing features whose presence in a face- to-face affair would be paradoxical. Like direct, face-to-face affairs, online affairs can be spontaneous and casual and show intensive personal involvement. However, online affairs can also be more of a planned discourse than spontaneous talk; like written letters, online messages can be stored and thus have permanent presence, which is absent from face-to-face affairs. People participating in online affairs may be strangers to each other in the sense that they have never actually met each other. However, they are also close to each other since they share intimate information. In online affairs, people try to enjoy the benefits of both close and remote affairs, while avoiding their flaws. People enjoy the highly valued products of close affairs while paying the low cost of remote affairs. As one woman wrote: 'He constantly told me that he can not provide me with what I would want and I would always respond with: \\"I'm not asking anything from you, but simply enjoy your company\\"'.

Established in 1975 by Emilio Estefan Jr., the band was originally known as the Miami Latin Boys before becoming the Miami Sound Machine in 1977. The band had a number of albums and a string of hit singles until 1989. The band's 1985 album Primitive Love credited the band whereas their follow-up album Let It Loose in 1987 placed Gloria Estefan at the forefront. From 1988-1989, the latter album was also repackaged as Anything For You with new cover art with the international release in Europe, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. In 1989, the group's name ceased being included on the CD or album products‚Äîas Estefan continued as a solo artist. The Miami Sound Machine continues to perform with Estefan on all her tours and live performances, and has appeared on many of Estefan's recordings. Background In 1975, Gloria and her cousin Mercedes \\"Merci\\" Navarro (1957‚Äì2007) met Emilio Estefan, Jr. while performing at a church ensemble rehearsal. Estefan, who had formed the band the Miami Latin Boys earlier that year, learned about Gloria through a mutual acquaintance. While the Miami Latin Boys were performing at a Cuban wedding at Hotel Dupont, Gloria and Merci (who were wedding guests) performed two Cuban standards impromptu. They impressed the Miami Latin Boys so much that they were invited to join the band permanently; thereby, the band's name was changed to Miami Sound Machine. Gloria, who was attending the University of Miami at the time, only agreed to perform during the weekends so that her studies would not be interrupted. The 1970s=The beginnings= Beginning in 1977, Miami Sound Machine began recording and releasing various albums and 45s on Audiofon Records in Miami, Florida. The group's primary lineup consisted of six Cuban-born Americans: * Emilio Estefan, Jr. (percussion and accordion) * Gloria Fajardo (lead vocals and hand percussion) * Merci Navarro (lead vocals) and her husband Raul Murciano (keyboards) * Enrique \\"Kiki\\" Garcia (drums) * Juan Marcos Avila (bass) = Live Again/Renacer = In 1977, Miami Sound Machine's first album Live Again/Renacer was released with two different covers. The group had several more releases on the Audiofon label, the RCA Victor label, and subsequently Miami Sound Machine's own label Miami Sound Machine Records. In 1978, Gloria married Emilio Estefan, Jr. after two years of dating. In 1979, Miami Sound Machine added American guitarist and native Miamian, Wesley B. Wright, and Cuban-born Fernando Garcia on trumpet (unrelated to \\"Kiki\\" Garcia). = Miami Sound Machine = By the end of 1979, the band was signed to Discos CBS International. Miami Sound Machine then released several albums, 45s, and twelve-inch singles beginning with the 1980 self-titled Miami Sound Machine. The combination of traditional Latin rhythms and American R&B; grooves (along with the songwriting talents of Gloria Estefan, \\"Kiki\\" Garcia, and Wesley B. Wright) set a crossover musical standard for the next two decades to come. The 1980s During the 1980s, with the popularity of Miami-based films and television series such as Scarface, Invasion USA, and Miami Vice, the city was gaining a reputation as an exciting and notorious destination. South Beach and the remainder of Dade County was also attracting attention. NFL Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino was breaking football records and adding to the Miami mystique. = Otra Vez = In 1980, Miami Sound Machine added a more complete horn section primarily consisting of trumpeters Fernando Garcia and Victor \\"Papito\\" Lopez and trombonist Louis Perez. The permanent addition of a full horn section added a new dimension and would become a future Miami Sound Machine musical trademark. MSM using this lineup flew to San Juan, Puerto Rico in 1981 to record their second LP on the C.B.S. International label. The album was entitled Otra Vez and was recorded at Ochoa Studios in San Juan, Puerto Rico. This would be the last LP to feature the early signature sound of two female vocalists (Gloria and her cousin Mercy) singing both in harmony and unison. =Rio= By early 1982, Roger Fisher was added as a second keyboardist, as well as the virtuoso harmonica player Gustavo Lezcano. Merci and Raul left the band in late 1982, just prior to the recording of the third CBS International LP Rio. The painfully shy Gloria was now the sole lead vocalist on stage and in the studio. As a result, she began to evolve both systematically and stylistically in her performances. Fisher filled Raul's piano duties. At the same time, Betty Cort√©s was brought in as replacement for Fisher's second keyboardist role and to sing background vocals live and occasionally in the studio. During the same time period, Elena Stracuzzi was brought in to sing background vocals for live performances. In 1983, Leo Villar was added as second trumpeter to replace Fernando Garcia who had left the prior year. =Eyes of Innocence= Miami Sound Machine was now a large ensemble. Despite an eclectic lineup, Miami Sound Machine was focused primarily on the founding members: * Gloria and Emilio Estefan * Enrique \\"Kiki\\" Garcia * Juan Marcos Avila * Wesley B. Wright By the early 1980s, Miami Sound Machine had established themselves as major musical artists in Latin America with a strong presence in both the media and on the radio. The next major hurdle was conquered in early 1984 when a Dutch DJ began playing \\"Dr. Beat\\" in Amsterdam. Garcia's catchy lyrics, Gloria's sassy vocals, Wright's funky guitar, and Emilio's infectious conga drums took Europe by storm with the tune eventually reaching #1 in the UK and most of Continental Europe, finally causing record labels in the US Market to take notice of the group's strong musical prowess. In late 1984, the group released their first Epic/Columbia album, Eyes of Innocence, which contained the Garcia-penned classic, previously released, single and dance hit \\"Dr. Beat\\" as well as the ballad \\"I Need Your Love\\". = Primitive Love = Miami Sound Machine's follow-up album Primitive Love was released in 1985. While the horn section were featured on prominent cuts, guitarist Wesley B. Wright was the only member of the core rhythm section to actually record on the LP. On all of the previous LPs, the band members almost exclusively recorded the original studio tracks. In 1985, there would be personnel changes: * Phenom session percussionist Rafael Pad√≠lla, who performed on some of the LP's tracks, was now a permanent member. * Chicago native Jim \\"Sport\\" Trompeter replaced Betty Wright (n√©e Cort√©s) on second keyboards. * Venezuelan jazz saxophonist Ed Call√© performed on the LP and was added to the horn section. The successful LP launched three top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100: the Garcia-penned \\"Conga\\" reached No. 10 on the Billboard Hot 100; \\"Bad Boy\\" reached No. 8 and \\"Words Get in the Way\\" (written by Gloria Estefan) reaching No. 5 on the Hot 100 and No. 1 on the US Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart, establishing that the group could perform pop ballads as successfully as dance tunes. At the end of 1985, the stalwart horn section was now in flux, with session player Dana Teboe filling the trombone position in place of the original trombonist, Louis Perez. By early 1986, Victor \\"Papito\\" Lopez (visually known for his iconic jet black Cuban mustache) was subsequently replaced by Randy Barlow. By the end of 1986, Teddy Mulet became the band's official trombonist. =Appearances and soundtracks = In 1985, Miami Sound Machine appeared on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, Solid Gold, American Bandstand, CBS Morning News, Walt Disney specials, and frequent spots on MTV. The band twice performed on the television presentation of the Miss Universe Pageant (1984; 1986). The song \\"Hot Summer Nights\\" was also released that year and was part of the soundtrack for the film Top Gun. The song \\"Suav√©\\" was also recorded as part of the soundtrack for the Sylvester Stallone film Cobra. Miami Sound Machine also made a cameo appearance in the ABC Sunday Night Movie Club Med. 1987 and Gloria Estefan and Miami Sound Machine After a massive world tour that ran from 1985‚Äì1986, the following members left the group: guitarist Wesley B. Wright; founding bassist Juan Marcos Avila; and keyboardist Roger Fisher. Emilio assumed the role of producer and no longer performed live. = Let It Loose / Anything for You = Miami Sound Machine returned to the studio in early 1987, and bassist Jorg√© \\"George\\" Casas on bass, keyboardist Clay Ostwald, and guitarist John DeFaria joined the remaining members. With \\"Kiki\\" Garcia being the remaining core member, Gloria Estefan was given top billing and the band's name was changed to Gloria Estefan and Miami Sound Machine to capitalize on the lead singer's mass appeal. In late 1987, Miami Sound Machine released Let It Loose, and it went multi-platinum, with three million copies sold in the US alone. It featured the hits \\"Anything for You\\" reaching number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, \\"1-2-3\\" making it to No. 3, \\"Betcha Say That\\" to number 36, \\"Rhythm Is Gonna Get You\\" to No. 5, and \\"Can't Stay Away from You\\" to No. 6. \\"Can't Stay Away from You\\", \\"Anything for You\\" and \\"1-2-3\\" were all top charting singles on the Adult Contemporary hits as well. Another world tour began and the group traveled for the first time to Europe, South America and an even more extensive tour in the United States, culminating in a finale with massive sold-out concert in their hometown of Miami, Florida, which was recorded and later sold on VHS. By 1988, founding member \\"Kiki\\" Garcia quit. With no other core members remaining other than Gloria herself, the \\"Miami Sound Machine\\" moniker was to be used from that point on for concerts and live performances only. In 1988, after the worldwide chart success of single \\"Anything for You\\", her Let it Loose album was repackaged overseas as Anything for You. It became the band's first UK number 1 album, selling over a million copies. It was the biggest selling album of the year in The Netherlands, staying at number 1 for 22 weeks. The album also took top honors in Australia and Canada, launching Gloria Estefan to superstar status. 1989, Gloria Estefan, departure of the original members and beyond= 1988‚Äìpresent = By the end of 1988, none of the originating members of the group that once was Miami Sound Machine were performing with Estefan. A new rhythm section was put in place, and the horn section was expanded. Although there have been changes in personnel, three members (Jorge Casas, Clay Ostwald and Teddy Mulet) have performed with Estefan since 1986. The current rhythm section has been in place since 1992 (with the subsequent addition of drummer Olbin Burgos and percussionist Edwin Bonilla). Seven members of the Miami Sound Machine lineage appeared in New York City's staging of the Broadway show On Your Feet!: Jorge Casas, Clay Ostwald, Teddy Mulet, Olbin Burgos, Edwin Bonilla, Tom Timko and David Fernandez. = Revamping attempt = In 2002, an attempt was made to create a shoot-off \\"Miami Sound Machine\\" with a new eponymous album (produced by Emilio Estefan) and a completely different lineup consisting of Lorena Pinot, Sohanny Gross and Carla Ramirez. Without Gloria Estefan's signature vocals or any real connection to the preexisting Miami Sound Machine musicians, however, the new project was only met with moderate success in a few select European countries and failed to chart significantly in the United States.

These proteins insert and assume a place in the bilayer structure of the membrane alongside the similar fatty acid tails. The lipid-anchored protein can be located on either side of the cell membrane. Thus, the lipid serves to anchor the protein to the cell membrane. They are a type of proteolipids. The lipid groups play a role in protein interaction and can contribute to the function of the protein to which it is attached. Furthermore, the lipid serves as a mediator of membrane associations or as a determinant for specific protein-protein interactions. For example, lipid groups can play an important role in increasing molecular hydrophobicity. This allows for the interaction of proteins with cellular membranes and protein domains. In a dynamic role, lipidation can sequester a protein away from its substrate to inactivate the protein and then activate it by Substrate presentation. Overall, there are three main types of lipid-anchored proteins which include prenylated proteins, fatty acylated proteins and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked proteins (GPI). A protein can have multiple lipid groups covalently attached to it, but the site where the lipid binds to the protein depends both on the lipid group and protein.  Prenylated proteins  Isoprene unit Prenylated proteins are proteins with covalently attached hydrophobic isoprene polymers (i.e. branched five-carbon hydrocarbon) at cysteine residues of the protein. More specifically, these isoprenoid groups, usually farnesyl (15-carbon) and geranylgeranyl (20-carbon) are attached to the protein via thioether linkages at cysteine residues near the C terminal of the protein. This prenylation of lipid chains to proteins facilitate their interaction with the cell membrane. 240x240px The prenylation motif ‚ÄúCAAX box‚Äù is the most common prenylation site in proteins, that is, the site where farnesyl or geranylgeranyl covalently attach. In the CAAX box sequence, the C represents the cysteine that is prenylated, the A represents any aliphatic amino acid and the X determines the type of prenylation that will occur. If the X is an Ala, Met, Ser or Gln the protein will be farnesylated via the farnesyltransferase enzyme and if the X is a Leu then the protein will be geranylgeranylated via the geranylgeranyltransferase I enzyme. Both of these enzymes are similar with each containing two subunits. = Roles and function = Prenylation chains (e.g. geranyl pyrophosphate) Prenylated proteins are particularly important for eukaryotic cell growth, differentiation and morphology. Furthermore, protein prenylation is a reversible post-translational modification to the cell membrane. This dynamic interaction of prenylated proteins with the cell membrane is important for their signalling functions and is often deregulated in disease processes such as cancer. More specifically, Ras is the protein that undergoes prenylation via farnesyltransferase and when it is switched on it can turn on genes involved in cell growth and differentiation. Thus overactiving Ras signalling can lead to cancer. An understanding of these prenylated proteins and their mechanisms have been important for the drug development efforts in combating cancer. Other prenylated proteins include members of the Rab and Rho families as well as lamins. Some important prenylation chains that are involved in the HMG-CoA reductase metabolic pathway are geranylgeraniol, farnesol and dolichol. These isoprene polymers (e.g. geranyl pyrophosphate and farnesyl pyrophosphate) are involved in the condensations via enzymes such as prenyltransferase that eventually cyclizes to form cholesterol.  Fatty acylated proteins  Fatty acylated proteins are proteins that have been post- translationally modified to include the covalent attachment of fatty acids at certain amino acid residues. The most common fatty acids that are covalently attached to the protein are the saturated myristic (14-carbon) acid and palmitic acid (16-carbon). Proteins can be modified to contain either one or both of these fatty acids.thumb219x219px Myristoylation = N-myristoylation = N-myristoylation (i.e. attachment of myristic acid) is generally an irreversible protein modification that typically occurs during protein synthesis in which the myrisitc acid is attached to the Œ±-amino group of an N-terminal glycine residue through an amide linkage. This reaction is facilitated by N-myristoyltransferase . These proteins usually begin with a - sequence and with either a serine or threonine at position 5. Proteins that have been myristoylated are involved in signal transduction cascade, protein- protein interactions and in mechanisms that regulate protein targeting and function. An example in which the myristoylation of a protein is important is in apoptosis, programmed cell death. After the protein BH3 interacting-domain death agonist (Bid) has been myristoylated, it targets the protein to move to the mitochondrial membrane to release cytochrome c, which then ultimately leads to cell death. Other proteins that are myristoylated and involved in the regulation of apoptosis are actin and gelsolin. = S-palmitoylation = Palmitoylation S-palmitoylation (i.e. attachment of palmitic acid) is a reversible protein modification in which a palmitic acid is attached to a specific cysteine residue via thioester linkage. The term S-acylation can also be used when other medium and long fatty acids chains are also attached to palmitoylated proteins. No consensus sequence for protein palmitoylation has been identified. Palmitoylated proteins are mainly found on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane where they play a role in transmembrane signaling. The palmitoyl group can be removed by palmitoyl thioesterases. It is believed that this reverse palmitoylation may regulate the interaction of the protein with the membrane and thus have a role in signaling processes. Furthermore, this allows for the regulation of protein subcellular localization, stability and trafficking. An example in which palmitoylation of a protein plays a role in cell signaling pathways is in the clustering of proteins in the synapse. When the postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) is palmitoylated, it is restricted to the membrane and allows it to bind to and cluster ion channels in the postsynaptic membrane. Thus, palmitoylation can play a role in the regulation of neurotransmitter release. Palmitoylation mediates the affinity of a protein for lipid rafts and facilitates the clustering of proteins. The clustering can increase the proximity of two molecules. Alternatively, clustering can sequester a protein away from a substrate. For example, palmitoylation of phospholipase D (PLD) sequesters the enzyme away from its substrate phosphatidylcholine. When cholesterol levels decrease or PIP2 levels increase the palmitate mediated localization is disrupted, the enzyme trafficks to PIP2 where it encounters its substrate and is active by substrate presentation.  GPI proteins  Structure of the glycophosphatidylinositol anchor in the plasma membrane of a eukaryotic cell Glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPI) proteins are attached to a GPI complex molecular group via an amide linkage to the protein's C-terminal carboxyl group. This GPI complex consists of several main components that are all interconnected: a phosphoethanolamine, a linear tetrasaccharide (composed of three mannose and a glucosaminyl) and a phosphatidylinositol. The phosphatidylinositol group is glycosidically linked to the non-N-acetylated glucosamine of the tetrasaccharide. A phosphodiester bond is then formed between the mannose at the nonreducing end (of the tetrasaccaride) and the phosphoethanolamine. The phosphoethanolamine is then amide linked to the C-terminal of the carboxyl group of the respective protein. The GPI attachment occurs through the action of GPI-transamidase complex. The fatty acid chains of the phosphatidylinositol are inserted into the membrane and thus are what anchor the protein to the membrane. These proteins are only located on the exterior surface of the plasma membrane. = Roles and function = The sugar residues in the tetrasaccaride and the fatty acid residues in the phosphatidylinositol group vary depending on the protein. This great diversity is what allows the GPI proteins to have a wide range of functions including acting as hydrolytic enzymes, adhesion molecule, receptors, protease inhibitor and complement regulatory proteins. Furthermore, GPI proteins play an important in embryogenesis, development, neurogenesis, the immune system and fertilization. More specifically, the GPI protein IZUMO1R/JUNO (named after the Roman goddess of fertility) on the egg plasma has an essential role in sperm-egg fusion. Releasing the IZUMO1R/JUNO GPI protein from the egg plasma membrane does not allow for sperm to fuse with the egg and it is suggested that this mechanism may contribute to the polyspermy block at the plasma membrane in eggs. Other roles that GPI modification allows for is in the association with membrane microdomains, transient homodimerization or in apical sorting in polarized cells.

History  After a failed first album, Desiertos (1990), they released Doble Opuesto (1991), which appears as the official first album of the band. Singles like \\"Desiertos,\\" \\"Tejedores de Ilusi√≥n,\\" and \\"Prisioneros de la Piel\\" made them stars in Chile, Argentina and Mexico, especially after the release of La Ley, their second recording (1993). After Bobe's death in 1994, La Ley continued with a new guitarist, Pedro Frugone, and released two more albums; in 1995, the band released Invisible, the album was their international breakout record and provided to the band their best-selling studio album to date, it included the number ones \\"Dia Cero\\" (in which, the rhythm and the video was inspired by the Duran Duran's smash hit \\"Come Undone\\") and \\"El Duelo\\". Before the release of V√©rtigo, Rodrigo Aboitiz left the band. In the middle of the tour, bassist Luciano Rojas left the band as well, and together with the Aboitiz formed a new group named Saiko. Their music became more rock and less experimental, and the musicians dropped their dark image. Not all of their fans were on board with the new style, but the last La Ley albums, Uno (2000) and Libertad (2003), consolidated the band as one of the most important in Latin America, earning it a Latin Grammy award for each of the two albums. La Ley also performed on MTV Unplugged in 2001, and released an album of the performance, which went on to win a Grammy award. In 2004, they released a greatest hits compilation (featuring three new songs: M√≠rate, Bienvenido al Anochecer, and Histeria) titled Historias e Histeria. In 2005 Rodrigo Aboitiz and Luciano Rojas performed with the band at the Vi√±a del Mar International Song Festival (Spanish: Festival Internacional de la Canci√≥n de Vi√±a del Mar) and after a tour around Latin America, the band dissolved in Buenos Aires on September 29, to work on their personal projects, leaving open the possibility for a return in the future. Most of the original members have since formed a group known as Dia Cero with Chilean singer Ignacio Redard.

Mecano became one of the most successful Spanish pop bands of all time. The band is still the best-selling Spanish band, with over 25 million records worldwide. They were considered by some to be avant-garde for their time and part of la Movida Madrile√±a countercultural movement. They had a brief comeback in 1998. The band's line-up was singer Ana Torroja and brothers Nacho and Jos√© Mar√≠a Cano, who worked alongside session musicians such as Arturo Terriza, Manolo Aguilar, Nacho Ma√±√≥, Javier Qu√≠lez, √Ångel Celada and √ìscar Astruga. The trio's musical career spanned two distinct stages. The first, up to 1985, was essentially as a synthpop band, while in the second stage Mecano followed a more acoustic pop rock direction, with elements of ballad, dance, flamenco, bossa nova, tango, salsa, rumba flamenca, bolero, pasodoble, and even reggae. The unprecedented success also hit Hispanic America. Also, thanks to adaptations to other languages of several of their songs, they influenced non- Spanish speaking countries such as Italy and France, as with their Une femme avec une femme. This foreign song still holds the record for most weeks spent at the top of the French charts. In 2005, Mecano's music was adapted into the successful musical Hoy no me puedo levantar, which opened productions in Spain and Mexico. After two years, it was announced that the musical had been seen by more than 1,500,000 spectators in both countries, making it the most successful original production in Spanish of all times. Some of their biggest number one singles include \\"Me cuesta tanto olvidarte\\", \\"La fuerza del destino\\", \\"Hijo de la luna\\", \\"Cruz de navajas\\", \\"Une femme avec une femme\\" (\\"Mujer contra mujer\\", a worldwide number one hit), and \\"El 7 de septiembre\\". History The band started as a synthpop ensemble (tecno pop in Spanish) by brothers Nacho and Jos√© Mar√≠a Cano, along with singer Ana Torroja, in 1981 in Madrid influenced by English new wave band Spandau Ballet. In a period of cultural experimentation in the newly democratic Spain, Mecano achieved its initial popularity with its debut single, \\"Hoy no me puedo levantar\\" (\\"I Can't Get Up Today\\"), a song about youth boredom and hangovers. Their first, self- titled album became a collection of classics that would later represent Spanish 1980s pop music. At the same time, Nacho Cano branched out into producing other bands, and both brothers started writing songs for other pop up-and-comers. Although those secondary acts wouldn't achieve the level of success Mecano gained, they turned out to be new testing grounds for Mecano. Having achieved another huge hit in 1986 with \\"Me cuesta tanto olvidarte\\" (\\"It's So Hard to Forget You\\"), the band reformed its musical approach with the album Entre el cielo y el suelo (Between the Sky and the Ground). Their new style emphasised pop over techno. It also facilitated the export of their music to Latin America. This new versatility was evidenced by \\"Hijo de la Luna\\" (\\"Son of the Moon\\"). This song was also submitted by the band as a potential contestant for Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest 1986, but TVE selected another band, Cadillac. Their follow-up album, Descanso Dominical (Sunday Rest), produced two of their most popular singles. One was, \\"La fuerza del destino,\\" (\\"The force of fate\\") in which actress Pen√©lope Cruz debuted in the video clip for it. She later had a relationship with Nacho Cano for several years. The other single \\"Mujer contra mujer\\" (\\"Woman against woman\\"), is about a lesbian relationship, seen through the eyes of a friend, who only later realises what is going on. It was recorded in French (\\"Une femme avec une femme\\"), English and Italian, giving Mecano their first truly global hit. The single which was released in Latin America in 1989, became a number one hit, it also remained seven consecutive weeks on the French number one position from 10 November to 22 December 1990; the song became one of the greatest hits of all time in that country. Aidalai (nonsense word meaning, \\"Oh Dalai\\"), their following album, was published in 1991 and was as successful as their previous two works. \\"El 7 de septiembre\\" (\\"7 September\\") was dedicated to Coloma Fern√°ndez Armero, who was Nacho Cano's girlfriend for several years. \\"El 7 de septiembre\\", which was released in the summer of 1992, was the last Ibero-American number one hit for the band, a music video was released for the song and it was inspired by the 1927 German silent film Metropolis. It was the last original album of the band. In 1993, the band announced a temporary hiatus. In 1998, the band released the album Ana, Jose, Nacho, which mixed new songs with greatest hits. The band separated later that year and all three members went on to have solo careers, though only Ana found success as a singer. In 2005 keyboardist Nacho Cano wrote a musical based on 32 Mecano songs, named after their first single. In 2005, the members of Mecano released a double-CD/DVD package commemorating the 25th anniversary of the creation of the band. The new CD/DVD, Mecanografia (Mecano-graphy), includes a compilation of all their singles, never-before released songs, and a DVD with videos and early concert appearances. The Cano brothers were innovative musicians in the use of technology, and Nacho was one of the first Spanish musicians to own a Fairlight keyboard. (Its screen can be seen in the back cover of their only live album). Jos√© Mar√≠a also commented that he often locked himself in a room with a dictionary and books to write his songs, while Nacho has said that to compose he started off with a rhythm machine, then added the melody, and the lyrics came in last. In November 2009, the band reunited with a new song to be released later that month. On 25 November 2011, the journalist Jos√© Antonio Abell√°n announced their reunion in ABC Punto Radio for a world tour in 2012. This was later denied. Other media such as the newspaper El Pa√≠s, confirmed the news and the world tour. Discography=Albums= *Mecano (1982) *¬øD√≥nde Est√° El Pa√≠s De Las Hadas?

(\\"What Do you Do in the World?\\"), among others. =Covers by other artists= Due to the popularity of their songs, Mecano has been covered by other artists in the Spanish-speaking as well as in the non-Spanish-speaking world. Songs from Entre el cielo y el suelo have been covered by Montserrat Caball√© and Celia Cruz. Also, the unpublished song L√≠a was sung by Ana Bel√©n. The Eurodance band Loona covered the song \\"Hijo de la luna\\" in 1998 and achieved a major hit with it. Laura Branigan recorded a version of \\"Mujer Contra Mujer\\" on her 1993 album Over My Heart. In 2008, Mexican singer Daniela Romo included the song in her album, Sue√±os de Cabaret. In 2004, Mexican pop singer Fey recorded the album La Fuerza Del Destino, an album consisting of 12 Mecano covers. This album was nominated for the Latin Grammy Awards in 2005. Costa Rican Latin grammy winners, Editus covered the song \\"Hijo De La Luna\\" in their album Siempre.... Non-Spanish covers include Sarah Brightman, who sang the songs \\"T√∫\\", \\"Hijo de la luna\\", \\"Naturaleza Muerta\\". Mario Frangoulis covered \\"Hijo de la luna\\" and \\"Naturaleza Muerta.\\" The Belgian-Spanish Belle Perez did the same. Greek singer Eleni Dimou covered \\"Hijo de la luna\\" translating it in Greek (\\"Œ†Œ≠œÜœÑŒµŒπ œÑŒø œÜŒµŒ≥Œ≥Œ¨œÅŒπ\\" - \\"Moon is falling\\"). The Spanish heavy metal band Stravaganzza covered the song \\"Hijo de la luna\\" in their most recent studio work: an EP called Hijo del Miedo (Son of Fear). Recently the crossover soprano Geraldine Larrosa covered a French/Spanish version of \\"Naturaleza Muerta\\". A Portuguese-language cover of \\"Hawaii‚ÄìBombay\\" was performed by Brazilian new wave band Metr√¥ on their 1985 album Olhar. Portuguese singer Jos√© Cid also sung a version of his own. In their 2008 album, Tales of Ithiria, the German symphonic metal band Haggard made a cover for \\"Hijo de la Luna\\". A Finnish pop-folk artist Tuula Amberla released a cover in Finnish of \\"Hijo de la Luna\\" called \\"Kuun poika\\" in 1992, later a symphonic metal band Katra made the same cover in their 2008 album Beast Within. In 2009, the Mexican singer Gloria Trevi sang a live cover of the song \\"Hijo de la Luna\\" on the Mexican television show, El Show de los Sue√±os. Also that same year the Brazilian-Venezuelan singer, Elisa Rego, did an electronic version of \\"Aire\\" song (Air) included in her fifth studio album titled \\"Temperamental\\". It is noteworthy that also in her beginnings (1982) Rego was the lead singer of ES-3, an underground rock band who specialized in performing Mecano covers in Caracas city night clubs long before this Spanish trio visited Venezuela for the first time in 1984 during the Promotional Tour of the \\"Ya Viene El Sol\\"-album (The Sun is Coming). Then their second visit to Venezuela was in 1986 in the promotional tour of \\"Entre el cielo y el suelo\\". The Italian extreme gothic metal band Theatres des Vampires made an Italian- language cover of \\"Hijo de la Luna\\" in their 2011 album Moonlight Waltz.

In particular, systems of intuitionistic logic do not include the law of the excluded middle and double negation elimination, which are fundamental inference rules in classical logic. Formalized intuitionistic logic was originally developed by Arend Heyting to provide a formal basis for Brouwer's programme of intuitionism. From a proof-theoretic perspective, Heyting‚Äôs calculus is a restriction of classical logic in which the law of excluded middle and double negation elimination have been removed. Excluded middle and double negation elimination can still be proved for some propositions on a case by case basis, however, but do not hold universally as they do with classical logic. Several systems of semantics for intuitionistic logic have been studied. One of these semantics mirrors classical Boolean-valued semantics but uses Heyting algebras in place of Boolean algebras. Another semantics uses Kripke models. These, however, are technical means for studying Heyting‚Äôs deductive system rather than formalizations of Brouwer‚Äôs original informal semantic intuitions. Semantical systems claiming to capture such intuitions, due to offering meaningful concepts of ‚Äúconstructive truth‚Äù (rather than merely validity or provability), are G√∂del‚Äôs dialectica interpretation, Kleene‚Äôs realizability, Medvedev‚Äôs logic of finite problems,Shehtman, V., \\"Modal Counterparts of Medvedev Logic of Finite Problems Are Not Finitely Axiomatizable,\\" in Studia Logica: An International Journal for Symbolic Logic, vol. 49, no. 3 (1990), pp. 365-385. or Japaridze‚Äôs computability logic. Yet such semantics persistently induce logics properly stronger than Heyting‚Äôs logic. Some authors have argued that this might be an indication of inadequacy of Heyting‚Äôs calculus itself, deeming the latter incomplete as a constructive logic.G. Japaridze. \\"In the beginning was game semantics\\". In: Games: Unifying Logic, Language and Philosophy. O. Majer, A.-V. Pietarinen and T. Tulenheimo, eds. Springer 2009, pp.249-350. Preprint  Mathematical constructivism  In the semantics of classical logic, propositional formulae are assigned truth values from the two-element set \\\\\\\\{\\\\top, \\\\bot\\\\\\\\} (\\"true\\" and \\"false\\" respectively), regardless of whether we have direct evidence for either case. This is referred to as the 'law of excluded middle', because it excludes the possibility of any truth value besides 'true' or 'false'. In contrast, propositional formulae in intuitionistic logic are not assigned a definite truth value and are only considered \\"true\\" when we have direct evidence, hence proof. (We can also say, instead of the propositional formula being \\"true\\" due to direct evidence, that it is inhabited by a proof in the Curry‚ÄìHoward sense.) Operations in intuitionistic logic therefore preserve justification, with respect to evidence and provability, rather than truth-valuation. Intuitionistic logic is a commonly-used tool in developing approaches to constructivism in mathematics. The use of constructivist logics in general has been a controversial topic among mathematicians and philosophers (see, for example, the Brouwer‚ÄìHilbert controversy). A common objection to their use is the above-cited lack of two central rules of classical logic, the law of excluded middle and double negation elimination. These are considered to be so important to the practice of mathematics that David Hilbert wrote of them: \\"Taking the principle of excluded middle from the mathematician would be the same, say, as proscribing the telescope to the astronomer or to the boxer the use of his fists. To prohibit existence statements and the principle of excluded middle is tantamount to relinquishing the science of mathematics altogether.\\" van Heijenoort: Hilbert (1927), p.476 Despite the serious challenges presented by the inability to utilize the valuable rules of excluded middle and double negation elimination, intuitionistic logic has practical use. One reason for this is that its restrictions produce proofs that have the existence property, making it also suitable for other forms of mathematical constructivism. Informally, this means that if there is a constructive proof that an object exists, that constructive proof may be used as an algorithm for generating an example of that object, a principle known as the Curry‚ÄìHoward correspondence between proofs and algorithms. One reason that this particular aspect of intuitionistic logic is so valuable is that it enables practitioners to utilize a wide range of computerized tools, known as proof assistants. These tools assist their users in the verification (and generation) of large-scale proofs, whose size usually precludes the usual human-based checking that goes into publishing and reviewing a mathematical proof. As such, the use of proof assistants (such as Agda or Coq) is enabling modern mathematicians and logicians to develop and prove extremely complex systems, beyond those which are feasible to create and check solely by hand. One example of a proof which was impossible to formally verify without algorithm is the famous proof of the four color theorem. This theorem stumped mathematicians for more than a hundred years, until a proof was developed which ruled out large classes of possible counterexamples, yet still left open enough possibilities that a computer program was needed to finish the proof. That proof was controversial for some time, but, later, it was verified using Coq. Syntax The Rieger‚ÄìNishimura lattice. Its nodes are the propositional formulas in one variable up to intuitionistic logical equivalence, ordered by intuitionistic logical implication. The syntax of formulas of intuitionistic logic is similar to propositional logic or first-order logic. However, intuitionistic connectives are not definable in terms of each other in the same way as in classical logic, hence their choice matters. In intuitionistic propositional logic (IPL) it is customary to use ‚Üí, ‚àß, ‚à®, ‚ä• as the basic connectives, treating ¬¨A as an abbreviation for . In intuitionistic first- order logic both quantifiers ‚àÉ, ‚àÄ are needed. = Weaker than classical logic = Intuitionistic logic can be understood as a weakening of classical logic, meaning that it is more conservative in what it allows a reasoner to infer, while not permitting any new inferences that could not be made under classical logic. Each theorem of intuitionistic logic is a theorem in classical logic, but not conversely. Many tautologies in classical logic are not theorems in intuitionistic logicin particular, as said above one of its chief points is to not affirm the law of the excluded middle so as to vitiate the use of non- constructive proof by contradiction which can be used to furnish existence claims without providing explicit examples of the objects that it proves exist. We say \\"not affirm\\" because while it is not necessarily true that the law is upheld in any context, no counterexample can be given: such a counterexample would be an inference (inferring the negation of the law for a certain proposition) disallowed under classical logic and thus is not allowed in a strict weakening like intuitionistic logic. Indeed, the double negation of the law is retained as a tautology of the system: that is, it is a theorem that eg [ eg (P \\\\vee eg P)] regardless of the proposition P. =Sequent calculus= Gerhard Gentzen discovered that a simple restriction of his system LK (his sequent calculus for classical logic) results in a system which is sound and complete with respect to intuitionistic logic. He called this system LJ. In LK any number of formulas is allowed to appear on the conclusion side of a sequent; in contrast LJ allows at most one formula in this position. Other derivatives of LK are limited to intuitionistic derivations but still allow multiple conclusions in a sequent. LJ'Proof Theory by G. Takeuti, is one example. = Hilbert-style calculus = Intuitionistic logic can be defined using the following Hilbert-style calculus. This is similar to a way of axiomatizing classical propositional logic. In propositional logic, the inference rule is modus ponens * MP: from \\\\phi and \\\\phi \\\\to \\\\psi infer \\\\psi and the axioms are * THEN-1: \\\\phi \\\\to (\\\\chi \\\\to \\\\phi ) * THEN-2: (\\\\phi \\\\to (\\\\chi \\\\to \\\\psi )) \\\\to ((\\\\phi \\\\to \\\\chi ) \\\\to (\\\\phi \\\\to \\\\psi )) * AND-1: \\\\phi \\\\land \\\\chi \\\\to \\\\phi * AND-2: \\\\phi \\\\land \\\\chi \\\\to \\\\chi * AND-3: \\\\phi \\\\to (\\\\chi \\\\to (\\\\phi \\\\land \\\\chi )) * OR-1: \\\\phi \\\\to \\\\phi \\\\lor \\\\chi * OR-2: \\\\chi \\\\to \\\\phi \\\\lor \\\\chi * OR-3: (\\\\phi \\\\to \\\\psi ) \\\\to ((\\\\chi \\\\to \\\\psi ) \\\\to ((\\\\phi \\\\lor \\\\chi) \\\\to \\\\psi )) * FALSE: \\\\bot \\\\to \\\\phi To make this a system of first- order predicate logic, the generalization rules * \\\\forall -GEN: from \\\\psi \\\\to \\\\phi infer \\\\psi \\\\to (\\\\forall x \\\\ \\\\phi ), if x is not free in \\\\psi * \\\\exists -GEN: from \\\\phi \\\\to \\\\psi infer (\\\\exists x \\\\ \\\\phi ) \\\\to \\\\psi , if x is not free in \\\\psi are added, along with the axioms * PRED-1: (\\\\forall x \\\\ \\\\phi (x)) \\\\to \\\\phi (t), if the term t is free for substitution for the variable x in \\\\phi (i.e., if no occurrence of any variable in t becomes bound in \\\\phi (t)) * PRED-2: \\\\phi (t) \\\\to (\\\\exists x \\\\ \\\\phi (x)), with the same restriction as for PRED-1  Optional connectives = Negation = If one wishes to include a connective \\\\lnot for negation rather than consider it an abbreviation for \\\\phi \\\\to \\\\bot , it is enough to add: * NOT-1': (\\\\phi \\\\to \\\\bot ) \\\\to \\\\lnot \\\\phi * NOT-2': \\\\lnot \\\\phi \\\\to (\\\\phi \\\\to \\\\bot ) There are a number of alternatives available if one wishes to omit the connective \\\\bot (false). For example, one may replace the three axioms FALSE, NOT-1', and NOT-2' with the two axioms * NOT-1: (\\\\phi \\\\to \\\\chi ) \\\\to ((\\\\phi \\\\to \\\\lnot \\\\chi ) \\\\to \\\\lnot \\\\phi ) * NOT-2: \\\\phi \\\\to (\\\\lnot \\\\phi \\\\to \\\\chi ) as at . Alternatives to NOT-1 are (\\\\phi \\\\to \\\\lnot \\\\chi ) \\\\to (\\\\chi \\\\to \\\\lnot \\\\phi ) or (\\\\phi \\\\to \\\\lnot \\\\phi ) \\\\to \\\\lnot \\\\phi . = Equivalence = The connective \\\\leftrightarrow for equivalence may be treated as an abbreviation, with \\\\phi \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\chi standing for (\\\\phi \\\\to \\\\chi ) \\\\land (\\\\chi \\\\to \\\\phi ). Alternatively, one may add the axioms * IFF-1: (\\\\phi \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\chi ) \\\\to (\\\\phi \\\\to \\\\chi ) * IFF-2: (\\\\phi \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\chi ) \\\\to (\\\\chi \\\\to \\\\phi ) * IFF-3: (\\\\phi \\\\to \\\\chi ) \\\\to ((\\\\chi \\\\to \\\\phi ) \\\\to (\\\\phi \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\chi )) IFF-1 and IFF-2 can, if desired, be combined into a single axiom (\\\\phi \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\chi ) \\\\to ((\\\\phi \\\\to \\\\chi ) \\\\land (\\\\chi \\\\to \\\\phi )) using conjunction.  Relation to classical logic  The system of classical logic is obtained by adding any one of the following axioms: * \\\\phi \\\\lor \\\\lnot \\\\phi (Law of the excluded middle. May also be formulated as (\\\\phi \\\\to \\\\chi ) \\\\to ((\\\\lnot \\\\phi \\\\to \\\\chi ) \\\\to \\\\chi ).) * \\\\lnot \\\\lnot \\\\phi \\\\to \\\\phi (Double negation elimination) * ((\\\\phi \\\\to \\\\chi ) \\\\to \\\\phi ) \\\\to \\\\phi (Peirce's law) * (\\\\lnot \\\\phi \\\\to \\\\lnot \\\\chi ) \\\\to (\\\\chi \\\\to \\\\phi ) (Law of contraposition) In general, one may take as the extra axiom any classical tautology that is not valid in the two- element Kripke frame \\\\circ{\\\\longrightarrow}\\\\circ (in other words, that is not included in Smetanich's logic). Another relationship is given by the G√∂del‚ÄìGentzen negative translation, which provides an embedding of classical first-order logic into intuitionistic logic: a first-order formula is provable in classical logic if and only if its G√∂del‚ÄìGentzen translation is provable intuitionistically. Therefore, intuitionistic logic can instead be seen as a means of extending classical logic with constructive semantics. In 1932, Kurt G√∂del defined a system of logics intermediate between classical and intuitionistic logic; G√∂del logics are concomitantly known as intermediate logics. =Non-interdefinability of operators= In classical propositional logic, it is possible to take one of conjunction, disjunction, or implication as primitive, and define the other two in terms of it together with negation, such as in ≈Åukasiewicz's three axioms of propositional logic. It is even possible to define all four in terms of a sole sufficient operator such as the Peirce arrow (NOR) or Sheffer stroke (NAND). Similarly, in classical first- order logic, one of the quantifiers can be defined in terms of the other and negation. These are fundamentally consequences of the law of bivalence, which makes all such connectives merely Boolean functions. The law of bivalence is not required to hold in intuitionistic logic, only the law of non- contradiction. As a result, none of the basic connectives can be dispensed with, and the above axioms are all necessary. Most of the classical identities are only theorems of intuitionistic logic in one direction, although some are theorems in both directions. They are as follows: Conjunction versus disjunction: * (\\\\phi \\\\wedge \\\\psi) \\\\to eg ( eg \\\\phi \\\\vee eg \\\\psi) * (\\\\phi \\\\vee \\\\psi) \\\\to eg ( eg \\\\phi \\\\wedge eg \\\\psi) * ( eg \\\\phi \\\\vee eg \\\\psi) \\\\to eg (\\\\phi \\\\wedge \\\\psi) * ( eg \\\\phi \\\\wedge eg \\\\psi) \\\\leftrightarrow eg (\\\\phi \\\\vee \\\\psi) Conjunction versus implication: * (\\\\phi \\\\wedge \\\\psi) \\\\to eg (\\\\phi \\\\to eg \\\\psi) * (\\\\phi \\\\to \\\\psi) \\\\to eg (\\\\phi \\\\wedge eg \\\\psi) * (\\\\phi \\\\wedge eg \\\\psi) \\\\to eg (\\\\phi \\\\to \\\\psi) * (\\\\phi \\\\to eg \\\\psi) \\\\leftrightarrow eg (\\\\phi \\\\wedge \\\\psi) Disjunction versus implication: * (\\\\phi \\\\vee \\\\psi) \\\\to ( eg \\\\phi \\\\to \\\\psi) * ( eg \\\\phi \\\\vee \\\\psi) \\\\to (\\\\phi \\\\to \\\\psi) Universal versus existential quantification: * (\\\\forall x \\\\ \\\\phi(x)) \\\\to eg (\\\\exists x \\\\ eg \\\\phi(x)) * (\\\\exists x \\\\ \\\\phi(x)) \\\\to eg (\\\\forall x \\\\ eg \\\\phi(x)) * (\\\\exists x \\\\ eg \\\\phi(x)) \\\\to eg (\\\\forall x \\\\ \\\\phi(x)) * (\\\\forall x \\\\ eg \\\\phi(x)) \\\\leftrightarrow eg (\\\\exists x \\\\ \\\\phi(x)) So, for example, \\"a or b\\" is a stronger propositional formula than \\"if not a, then b\\", whereas these are classically interchangeable. On the other hand, \\"not (a or b)\\" is equivalent to \\"not a, and also not b\\". If we include equivalence in the list of connectives, some of the connectives become definable from others: * (\\\\phi\\\\leftrightarrow \\\\psi) \\\\leftrightarrow ((\\\\phi \\\\to \\\\psi)\\\\land(\\\\psi\\\\to\\\\phi)) * (\\\\phi\\\\to\\\\psi) \\\\leftrightarrow ((\\\\phi\\\\lor\\\\psi) \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\psi) * (\\\\phi\\\\to\\\\psi) \\\\leftrightarrow ((\\\\phi\\\\land\\\\psi) \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\phi) * (\\\\phi\\\\land\\\\psi) \\\\leftrightarrow ((\\\\phi\\\\to\\\\psi)\\\\leftrightarrow\\\\phi) * (\\\\phi\\\\land\\\\psi) \\\\leftrightarrow (((\\\\phi\\\\lor\\\\psi)\\\\leftrightarrow\\\\psi)\\\\leftrightarrow\\\\phi) In particular, {‚à®, ‚Üî, ‚ä•} and {‚à®, ‚Üî, ¬¨} are complete bases of intuitionistic connectives. As shown by Alexander Kuznetsov, either of the following connectives ‚Äì the first one ternary, the second one quinary ‚Äì is by itself functionally complete: either one can serve the role of a sole sufficient operator for intuitionistic propositional logic, thus forming an analog of the Sheffer stroke from classical propositional logic:Alexander Chagrov, Michael Zakharyaschev, Modal Logic, vol. 35 of Oxford Logic Guides, Oxford University Press, 1997, pp. 58‚Äì59. . * ((p\\\\lor q)\\\\land eg r)\\\\lor( eg p\\\\land(q\\\\leftrightarrow r)), * p\\\\to(q\\\\land eg r\\\\land(s\\\\lor t)). Semantics The semantics are rather more complicated than for the classical case. A model theory can be given by Heyting algebras or, equivalently, by Kripke semantics. Recently, a Tarski- like model theory was proved complete by Bob Constable, but with a different notion of completeness than classically. Unproved statements in intuitionistic logic are not given an intermediate truth value (as is sometimes mistakenly asserted). One can prove that such statements have no third truth value, a result dating back to Glivenko in 1928. Instead they remain of unknown truth value, until they are either proved or disproved. Statements are disproved by deducing a contradiction from them. A consequence of this point of view is that intuitionistic logic has no interpretation as a two-valued logic, nor even as a finite-valued logic, in the familiar sense. Although intuitionistic logic retains the trivial propositions \\\\\\\\{\\\\top, \\\\bot\\\\\\\\} from classical logic, each proof of a propositional formula is considered a valid propositional value, thus by Heyting's notion of propositions-as-sets, propositional formulae are (potentially non-finite) sets of their proofs. =Heyting algebra semantics= In classical logic, we often discuss the truth values that a formula can take. The values are usually chosen as the members of a Boolean algebra. The meet and join operations in the Boolean algebra are identified with the ‚àß and ‚à® logical connectives, so that the value of a formula of the form A ‚àß B is the meet of the value of A and the value of B in the Boolean algebra. Then we have the useful theorem that a formula is a valid proposition of classical logic if and only if its value is 1 for every valuation‚Äîthat is, for any assignment of values to its variables. A corresponding theorem is true for intuitionistic logic, but instead of assigning each formula a value from a Boolean algebra, one uses values from an Heyting algebra, of which Boolean algebras are a special case. A formula is valid in intuitionistic logic if and only if it receives the value of the top element for any valuation on any Heyting algebra. It can be shown that to recognize valid formulas, it is sufficient to consider a single Heyting algebra whose elements are the open subsets of the real line R. In this algebra we have: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\text{Value}[\\\\bot] &=\\\\emptyset \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\text{Value}[\\\\top] &= \\\\mathbf{R} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\text{Value}[A \\\\land B] &= \\\\text{Value}[A] \\\\cap \\\\text{Value}[B] \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\text{Value}[A \\\\lor B] &= \\\\text{Value}[A] \\\\cup \\\\text{Value}[B] \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\text{Value}[A \\\\to B] &= \\\\text{int} \\\\left ( \\\\text{Value}[A]^\\\\complement \\\\cup \\\\text{Value}[B] \\\\right ) \\\\end{align} where int(X) is the interior of X and X‚àÅ its complement. The last identity concerning A ‚Üí B allows us to calculate the value of ¬¨A: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\text{Value}[ eg A] &= \\\\text{Value}[A \\\\to \\\\bot] \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\text{int} \\\\left ( \\\\text{Value}[A]^\\\\complement \\\\cup \\\\text{Value}[\\\\bot] \\\\right ) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\text{int} \\\\left ( \\\\text{Value}[A]^\\\\complement \\\\cup \\\\emptyset \\\\right ) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\text{int} \\\\left ( \\\\text{Value}[A]^\\\\complement \\\\right ) \\\\end{align} With these assignments, intuitionistically valid formulas are precisely those that are assigned the value of the entire line. For example, the formula ¬¨(A ‚àß ¬¨A) is valid, because no matter what set X is chosen as the value of the formula A, the value of ¬¨(A ‚àß ¬¨A) can be shown to be the entire line: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\text{Value}[ eg(A \\\\land eg A)] &= \\\\text{int} \\\\left ( \\\\text{Value} [A \\\\land eg A]^\\\\complement \\\\right ) && \\\\text{Value}[ eg B] = \\\\text{int}\\\\left ( \\\\text{Value}[B]^\\\\complement \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\text{int} \\\\left ( \\\\left (\\\\text{Value}[A] \\\\cap \\\\text{Value}[ eg A] \\\\right )^\\\\complement \\\\right )\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\text{int} \\\\left ( \\\\left (\\\\text{Value}[A] \\\\cap \\\\text{int} \\\\left (\\\\text{Value}[A]^\\\\complement \\\\right ) \\\\right )^\\\\complement \\\\right ) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\text{int} \\\\left ( \\\\left (X \\\\cap \\\\text{int} \\\\left (X^\\\\complement \\\\right ) \\\\right )^\\\\complement \\\\right ) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\text{int} \\\\left (\\\\emptyset^\\\\complement \\\\right ) && \\\\text{int} \\\\left (X^\\\\complement \\\\right ) \\\\subset X^\\\\complement \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\text{int} (\\\\mathbf{R}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\mathbf{R} \\\\end{align} So the valuation of this formula is true, and indeed the formula is valid. But the law of the excluded middle, A ‚à® ¬¨A, can be shown to be invalid by using a specific value of the set of positive real numbers for A: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\text{Value}[A \\\\lor eg A] &= \\\\text{Value}[A] \\\\cup \\\\text{Value}[ eg A] \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\text{Value}[A] \\\\cup \\\\text{int} \\\\left ( \\\\text{Value}[A]^\\\\complement \\\\right) && \\\\text{Value}[ eg B] = \\\\text{int}\\\\left ( \\\\text{Value}[B]^\\\\complement \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\\\\\{ x > 0\\\\\\\\} \\\\cup \\\\text{int} \\\\left ( \\\\\\\\{x > 0\\\\\\\\}^\\\\complement \\\\right ) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\\\\\{ x > 0\\\\\\\\} \\\\cup \\\\text{int} \\\\left ( \\\\\\\\{x \\\\leqslant 0 \\\\\\\\} \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\\\\\{ x > 0\\\\\\\\} \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{x < 0 \\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\\\\\{ x eq 0 \\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & eq \\\\mathbf{R} \\\\end{align} The interpretation of any intuitionistically valid formula in the infinite Heyting algebra described above results in the top element, representing true, as the valuation of the formula, regardless of what values from the algebra are assigned to the variables of the formula. Conversely, for every invalid formula, there is an assignment of values to the variables that yields a valuation that differs from the top element.Alfred Tarski, Der Aussagenkalk√ºl und die Topologie, Fundamenta Mathematicae 31 (1938), 103‚Äì134. No finite Heyting algebra has both these properties. =Kripke semantics= Building upon his work on semantics of modal logic, Saul Kripke created another semantics for intuitionistic logic, known as Kripke semantics or relational semantics.Intuitionistic Logic. Written by Joan Moschovakis. Published in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. =Tarski-like semantics= It was discovered that Tarski-like semantics for intuitionistic logic were not possible to prove complete. However, Robert Constable has shown that a weaker notion of completeness still holds for intuitionistic logic under a Tarski- like model. In this notion of completeness we are concerned not with all of the statements that are true of every model, but with the statements that are true in the same way in every model. That is, a single proof that the model judges a formula to be true must be valid for every model. In this case, there is not only a proof of completeness, but one that is valid according to intuitionistic logic. =Relation to other logics= Intuitionistic logic is related by duality to a paraconsistent logic known as Brazilian, anti- intuitionistic or dual-intuitionistic logic. The subsystem of intuitionistic logic with the FALSE axiom removed is known as minimal logic.  Relation to many-valued logic  Kurt G√∂del's work involving many-valued logic showed in 1932 that intuitionistic logic is not a finite-valued logic. (See the section titled Heyting algebra semantics above for an infinite-valued logic interpretation of intuitionistic logic.)  Relation to intermediate logics  Any finite Heyting algebra which is not equivalent to a Boolean algebra defines (semantically) an intermediate logic. On the other hand, validity of formulae in pure intuitionistic logic is not tied to any individual Heyting algebra but relates to any and all Heyting algebras at the same time.  Relation to modal logic  Any formula of the intuitionistic propositional logic (IPC) may be translated into the normal modal logic S4 as follows: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\bot^* &= \\\\bot \\\\\\\\\\\\ A^* &= \\\\Box A && \\\\text{if } A \\\\text{ is prime (a positive literal)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ (A \\\\wedge B)^*&= A^* \\\\wedge B^* \\\\\\\\\\\\ (A \\\\vee B)^* &= A^* \\\\vee B^* \\\\\\\\\\\\ (A \\\\to B)^*&= \\\\Box \\\\left (A^* \\\\to B^* \\\\right ) \\\\\\\\\\\\ ( eg A)^*&= \\\\Box( eg (A^*)) && eg A := A \\\\to \\\\bot \\\\end{align} and it has been demonstratedL√©vy, Michel (2011). Logique modale propositionnelle S4 et logique intuitioniste propositionnelle, pp. 4‚Äì5. that the translated formula is valid in the propositional modal logic S4 if and only if the original formula is valid in IPC. The above set of formulae are called the G√∂del‚ÄìMcKinsey‚ÄìTarski translation. There is also an intuitionistic version of modal logic S4 called Constructive Modal Logic CS4.Natasha Alechina, Michael Mendler, Valeria de Paiva, and Eike Ritter. Categorical and Kripke Semantics for Constructive S4 Modal Logic =Lambda calculus= There is an extended Curry‚ÄìHoward isomorphism between IPC and simply-typed lambda calculus.

Reading left to right Lucas Grey is the father of three children, the grandfather of five grandchildren and the great- grandfather of three siblings Joseph, John and Laura Wetter. An ahnenblatt family tree Family tree showing the relationship of each person to the orange person, including cousins and gene share. A family tree, or pedigree chart, is a chart representing family relationships in a conventional tree structure. The more detailed family trees used in medicine and social work are known as genograms. Family history representations Genealogical data can be represented in several formats, for example as a pedigree or '. Family trees are often presented with the oldest generations at the top and the newer generations at the bottom. An ancestry chart, which is a tree showing the ancestors of an individual, will more closely resemble a tree in shape, being wider at the top than the bottom. In some ancestry charts, an individual appears on the left and his or her ancestors appear to the right. A descendancy chart, which depicts all the descendants of an individual will be narrowest at the top. Family trees can have many themes. One might encompass all direct descendants of a single figure, or all known ancestors of a living person. Another might include all members of a particular surname (e.g. male- line descendants). Yet another approach is to construct a tree including all holders of a certain office, such as kings of Germany. This relies on dynastic marriage to hold together the links between dynasties. Not every family tree is viewed from the side (pedigree or bracket chart). By looking down vertically at the top of a descendant tree, growing outward from one generation to the next, a family tree can be shown in a compact space. A time scale is used expanding radially about the center in decades. Children of the parent form branches around the center and their names are plotted in their birth year of the time scale. Spouse names join children names and families grow new branches to grandchildren, and so on. It is convenient to use great grandparents in the center to portray four or five generations, which appear in the natural growth pattern of a tree as seen from the top. In a descendant tree, living relatives are common on the outer branches and contemporary cousins appear adjacent to each other. Privacy should be considered when preparing a living family tree. John Meng-Frecker, Family Tree Tops, https://familytreetops.com The image of the tree probably originated with one in medieval art of the Tree of Jesse,Simon Julian Gilmour (2000) Daz Sint Noch Ungelogeniu Wort: A Literary and Linguistic Commentary on the Gurnemanz Episode in Book III of Wolfram's Parzival. Universit√§tsverlag Winter, 2000. p.64 used to illustrate the Genealogy of Christ in terms of a prophecy of Isaiah (Isaiah 11:1). Possibly the first non-Biblical use, and the first to show full family relationships rather than a purely patrilineal scheme, was that involving family trees of the classical gods in Boccaccio's Genealogia deorum gentilium (\\"On the Genealogy of the Gods of the Gentiles\\"), whose first version dates to 1360. =Ahnentafel= An ahnentafel family tree displaying an ancestor chart of Sigmund Christoph, Graf von Zeil und Trauchburg An ahnentafel (German for \\"ancestor table\\") is a genealogical numbering system for listing a person's direct ancestors in a fixed sequence of ascent: # Subject (or proband) # Father # Mother # Paternal grandfather # Paternal grandmother # Maternal grandfather # Maternal grandmother and so on, back through the generations. Apart from , who can be male or female, all even- numbered persons are male, and all odd-numbered persons are female. In this scheme, the number of any person's father is double the person's number, and a person's mother is double the person's number plus one. This system can be displayed as a tree: An ahnentafel family tree, showing three generations of the Kennedy Family =Fan chart= Screenshot of Gramps (v. 5.0.1) displaying a fan chart and the Given name cloud gramplet on the bottom. A \\"fan chart\\" features a half circle chart with concentric rings: the person of interest is the inner circle, the second circle is divided in two (each side is one parent), the third circle is divided in four, and so forth. Fan charts depict paternal and maternal ancestors. Graph theory While family trees are depicted as trees, family relations do not in general form a tree in the sense of graph theory, since distant relatives can mate, so a person can have a common ancestor on their mother's and father's side. However, because a parent must be born before their child is born, a person cannot be their own ancestor, and thus there are no loops, so ancestry forms a directed acyclic graph. The graphs of matrilineal descent (\\"mother\\" relationships between women) and patrilineal descent (\\"father\\" relationships between men) are trees however. Assuming no common ancestor, an ancestry chart is a perfect binary tree, as each person has exactly one mother and one father, for two parents; these thus have a regular structure. A descendancy chart, on the other hand, does not in general have a regular structure, as a person can have any number of children, or none at all. Notable examples Family trees are a age-old phenomenon. This example dates from the sixteenth century. The longest family tree in the world is that of the Chinese philosopher and educator Confucius (551‚Äì479 BC), and he is the descendant of King Tang (1675‚Äì1646 BC). The tree spans more than 80 generations from him, and includes more than 2 million members. An international effort involving more than 450 branches around the world was started in 1998 to retrace and revise this family tree. A new edition of the Confucius genealogy was printed in September 2009 by the Confucius Genealogy Compilation Committee, to coincide with the 2560th anniversary of the birth of the Chinese thinker. This latest edition is expected to include some 1.3 million living members who are scattered around the world today.Confucius family tree has two million members from China Daily, unknown date, updated February 16, 2008 There are extensive genealogies for the ruling dynasties of China, but these do not form a single, unified family tree; and it is unclear at which point(s) the most ancient historical figures named become mythological. In Japan, the ancestry of the Imperial Family is traced back to the mythological origins of Japan. The connection to persons from the established historical record begins in the mid-first millennium AD. Another very old and extensive tree is that of the Lurie lineage‚Äîwhich includes Sigmund Freud and Martin Buber‚Äîand traces back to Jehiel Lurie, a 13th-century rabbi in Brest-Litovsk, and from there to Rashi and purportedly back to the legendary King David, as documented by Neil Rosenstein in his book The Lurie Legacy. The 1999 edition of the Guinness Book of Records recorded the Lurie family in the \\"longest lineage\\" category as oldest-known living family in the world today. The Biblical genealogies of Jesus also claim descent from the House of David; covering a period of approximately 1000 years. In the Torah and Old Testament, genealogies are provided for many biblical persons, including a record of the descendants of Adam. According to the Torah, the Kohanim are descended from Aaron. Genetic testing performed at the Technion has shown that most modern Kohanim share common Y-chromosome origins, although there is no complete family tree of the Kohanim. In the Islamic world, claimed descent from the prophet Mohammed greatly enhanced the status of political and religious leaders. New dynasties often used claims of such descent to help establish their legitimacy. In Europe, the pedigree of Niall No√≠g√≠allach would be a contender for the longest, through Conn of the Hundred Battles (fl. 123 AD); in the legendary history of Ireland he is further descended from Breog√°n, and ultimately from Adam, through the sons of Noah. Many noble and aristocratic families of European and West-Asian origin can reliably trace their ancestry back as far as the mid to late first millennium AD; some claiming undocumented descent from Classical Antiquity or mythological ancestors. Before the Dark Ages, in the Greco-Roman world, some reliable pedigrees dated back perhaps at least as far as the first half of the first millennium BC; with claimed or mythological origins reaching back further. Roman clan and family lineages played an important part in the structure of their society, and were the basis of their intricate system of personal names. However, there was a break in the continuity of records-keeping at the end of Classical Antiquity. Records of the lines of succession of the Popes and the Eastern Roman Emperors through this transitional period have survived, but these are not continuous genealogical histories of single families. See: descent from antiquity. In Africa, the ruling dynasty of Ethiopia claimed descent from King Solomon via the Queen of Sheba. Through this claim, the family traced their descent back to the aforementioned House of David. The genealogy of Ancient Egyptian ruling dynasties was recorded from the beginnings of the Pharaonic era circa 3000 BC, to the end of the Ptolomaic Kingdom; although this is not a record of one continuously-linked family lineage, and surviving records are incomplete. Elsewhere in Africa, oral traditions of genealogical recording predominate. Members of the Keita dynasty of Mali, for example, have had their pedigrees sung by griots during annual ceremonies since the 14th century. Meanwhile, in Nigeria, many ruling clans - most notably those descended from Oduduwa - claim descent from the legendary King Kisra. Here too, pedigrees are recited by griots attached to the royal courts. In some pre-contact Native American civilizations, genealogical records of ruling and priestly families were kept, some of which extended over at least several centuries. In many human cultures, clan and tribal associations are based on claims of common ancestry; although detailed documentation of those origins is often very limited. Other uses The author Pete Frame is notable for having produced \\"family trees\\" of rock bands.

In 1497, Vasco da Gama sailed along the whole coast of South Africa on his way to India, landed at St Helena Bay for 8 days, and made a detailed description of the area. The Portuguese, attracted by the riches of Asia, made no permanent settlement at the Cape Colony. However, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) settled the area as a location where vessels could restock water and provisions.  First settlement  A romanticised depiction of the arrival of Jan van Riebeeck in Table Bay (by Charles Bell) The Dutch East India Company settlement in the area began in March 1647, with the shipwreck of the Dutch ship Nieuwe Haarlem. The shipwreck victims built a small fort that they named the \\"Sand Fort of the Cape of Good Hope.\\" They stayed for nearly one year, until they were rescued by a fleet of 12 ships under the command of W. G. de Jong. After their return to Holland some of the shipwrecked crewmates tried to persuade the Dutch East India Company to open a trading center at the Cape. A Dutch East India Company expedition of 90 Calvinist settlers, under the command of Jan van Riebeeck, founded the first permanent settlement near the Cape of Good Hope in 1652. Jan van Riebeeck was on one of the rescue ships that had come to rescue the shipwrecked sailors, and upon seeing the land, he decided to return. They arrived in the harbour of modern-day Cape Town on 6 April 1652 with five ships: #Reijer, #Oliphant, #Goede Hoop, #Walvisch, #Dromedaris. The settlers initially built a clay and timber fort, which was replaced between 1666 and 1679 by the Castle of Good Hope, which is now the oldest building in South Africa. The Colony began properly in 1671 with the first purchase of land from the Khoikhoi (called \\"Hottentots\\" by the settlers) beyond the original limits of the fort built by van Riebeeck. Sketch of Castle of Good Hope Courtyard in 1680 A long term policy of the VOC was to limit the growth of the colony to a small clearly defined area. Initially the VOC had hoped to employ a small number of servants and employees to produce food close to the fortress whilst obtaining cattle from the local Khoikhoi. However repeated crop failures convinced company officials to release nine servants to become semi-independent burgers who would produce food on free hold farms. Land grants were limited until the arrival of the colony's new commander Simon van der Stel in 1679. Van der Stel pursued an expansionist agricultural policy which was continued by his son William thereby increasing the number of farms in the colony to 258 by 1705. The number of free hold farms almost doubled by 1731 to 435 farms. Income inequality increased rapidly in the early years of the colony's development and by 1731 only 7% of the colony's small free settler population controlled over half of all the private property in the colony. The earliest colonists were, for the most part, from the lower, working class and displayed an indifferent attitude towards developing the colony, but after a commissioner that was sent out in 1685 to attract more settlers, a more dedicated group of immigrants began to arrive. French refugees began to arrive in the Cape after leaving their country after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. This small body of immigrants had a marked influence on the character of the Dutch settlers. Owing to the policy instituted in 1701 of the Dutch East India Company which dictated that schools should teach exclusively in Dutch and strict laws of assembly, the Huguenots ceased by the middle of the 18th century to maintain a distinct identity, and the knowledge of French disappeared. By the late 1700s the Cape Colony was one of the best developed European settlements outside Europe or the Americas.Smith, Adam (1776), Wealth of Nations , Penn State Electronic Classics edition, republished 2005, p.516 Economy The two pillars of the Cape Colony's economy for almost the entirety of its history were shipping and agriculture. Its strategic position meant that prior to the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 almost every ship sailing between Europe and Asia stopped off at the colony's capital Cape Town. The supplying of these ships with fresh provisions, fruit, and wine provided a very large market for the surplus produce of the colony.  Further expansion  Expansion of the Dutch Cape Colony. The Cape colonists gradually acquired all of the land of the Khoikhoi to the north and east of their base at Cape Town. Besides those who died in warfare, whole tribes of Khoikhoi were severely disrupted by smallpox epidemics in 1713 and 1755. A few remaining tribes maintained their independence, but the majority of the Khoikhoi took jobs with the colonists as herdsmen. The Dutch East India Company government passed a law in 1787 subjecting the remaining nomadic Khoikhoi to certain restrictions. The direct effect of this law was to make the Khoikhoi even more dependent upon the farmers, or to compel them to migrate northward beyond the colonial border. Those who chose the latter encountered the hostility of their old foes, the San, who inhabited the plains from the Nieuwveld and Sneeuwberg mountains to the Orange River.  Conflicts with the Dutch East India Company  Neither the hostility of the natives, nor the struggle to make agriculture profitable on Karoo or veld, slowed the progress made by the colonists as much as the narrow and tyrannical policy adopted by the Dutch East India Company. The Company stopped the colony's policy of open immigration, monopolised trade, combined the administrative, legislative and judicial powers into one body, told the farmers what crops to grow, demanded a large percentage of every farmer's harvest, and harassed them. This tended to discourage further development of industry and enterprise. From these roots sprung a dislike of orderly government, and libertarian view-point that has characterised the \\"boers\\" or Dutch farmers for many generations. Seeking largely to escape the oppression of the Dutch East India Company, the farmers trekked farther and farther from the seat of government. The Company, to control these emigrants, established a magistracy at Swellendam in 1745 and another at Graaff Reinet in 1786. The authorities declared the Gamtoos River as the eastern frontier of the colony, but the trekkers soon crossed it. To avoid collision with the bantu tribes advancing south and west from east central Africa, the Dutch agreed in 1780 to make the Great Fish River the boundary of the colony. In 1795 the heavily-taxed boers of the frontier districts, who received no protection against the Africans, expelled the officials of the Dutch East India Company, and established independent governments at Swellendam and at Graaff Reinet. The Netherlands fell to the French army under the leadership of Napol√©on Bonaparte in 1795. Reacting to the weakness of the Dutch East India Company holdings, a British army under General Sir James Henry Craig set out for Cape Town to secure the colony for the Stadtholder Prince William V of Orange against the French. The governor of Cape Town refused at first to obey any instructions from the prince, but after the British threatened to use force, he capitulated. The boers of Graaff Reinet did not surrender until an army had been sent against them, and in 1799 and again in 1801 they rose in revolt. In February 1803, as a result of the Peace of Amiens, the colony came under the control of the Batavian Republic.

Charo began playing guitar at the age of 9 and trained under the famed Andr√©s Segovia. In 1966 she married bandleader Xavier Cugat and they moved to the United States. In the late 1960s and 1970s, she became a ubiquitous presence on American television, frequently appearing as a guest star on series such as Laugh-In, Fantasy Island, The Love Boat, and The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. She is known for her uninhibited and exuberant manner, vague age, ostensible lack of fluency in English, heavy Spanish accent, and the catch-phrase \\"cuchi-cuchi.\\" As a musician, she has performed and recorded in various styles for five decades. She released a series of disco recordings in the 1970s with Salsoul Records, most notably Dance a Little Bit Closer (1977). In 1995 her flamenco album Guitar Passion (1994) won the Female Pop Album of the Year award at the Billboard International Latin Music Conference and was named best female Latin pop album by Billboard.Ru√≠z, Vicki and Virginia S√°nchez Korrol. Latinas in the United States: A Historical Encyclopedia. Indiana University Press (2006), p. 144. In an interview Charo said, \\"Around the world I am known as a great musician. But in America I am known as the cuchi-cuchi girl. That‚Äôs okay because cuchi-cuchi has taken me all the way to the bank.\\" Early life Charo was born in the town of Murcia, Spain. Her birth date and year has been a matter of some dispute. Her Spanish passport gives her name as Mar√≠a del Rosario Mercedes Pilar Mart√≠nez Molina Baeza. Charo has occasionally claimed that she was enrolled in a convent as a young child and remained there until she was 15, when a nun stated that she belonged in show business.\\"Coochie-coochie comedienne wants to be 'zee' dramatic actress\\", Montreal Gazette, May 10, 1982. In the most colorful version of this childhood, Charo's grandmother hired a music professor to give her weekly classical guitar lessons, and he became the first man to enter the convent.\\"She's dynamite: You might say Charo's rather un-convent-ional\\", Chicago Tribune, April 29, 1974. In a 2005 interview she reminisced: \\"The institution had great young teachers and students. Everything was a charity. Mr. Segovia, between concerts that's when he'd come, and if you'd been there a year and you weren't good, you'd go out and they would give your place to another young kid.\\"\\"Ageless Charo keeps the cuchi cuchi flame burning\\", San Francisco Chronicle, August 6, 2005. Charo has stated in several interviews that she graduated with honors at age 16.\\"Charo: She's more than just miss 'Cuchi, Cuchi'\\", Napa Valley Register, September 8, 2010 Charo was discovered as a young performer by bandleader Xavier Cugat, whom she later wed on August 7, 1966. When they married, Cugat was 66 and had already been married four times (Rita Montaner, Carmen Castillo, Lorraine Allen, and Abbe Lane), although reports sometimes listed fewer marriages. An April 1966 column by Earl Wilson on the couple's wedding plans announced, \\"Sixty-year-old Xavier Cugat and his 20-year-old Spanish girlfriend and singing star Charo hope to marry in San Cugat, Spain, in a few days if Cugat can convince church authorities his two divorces should not be counted against him since he wasn't married in church.\\" The couple was the first to have their nuptials in Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. She later claimed that her marriage to Cugat had been merely a business contract, a way for him to legally bring her over to the United States where he was based.\\"Fin del 'cuchi cuchi', principio del arte\\", La Opini√≥n Digital, February 17, 2005 =Year of birth controversy= Charo's year of birth has been the subject of dispute for many years. Official documents in her birthplace of Murcia, including her original Spanish passport and her naturalization papers, state that her birth date is March 13, 1941. After immigrating to the United States, Charo said that she was born in 1947, then changed it to 1949.\\"These stars keep tight rein on real ages\\", The Pittsburgh Press, August 9, 1986. In her final change, she asserted in a 1977 court hearing that her passport and naturalization papers were wrong and that her birthdate was January 15, 1951. The performer has said in interviews that her parents allowed her to falsify her age to appear older when marrying 66-year-old Xavier Cugat in 1966, although according to her later claims, that would have made her 15 at the time. However, as noted previously, she has stated in many interviews that she was attending school in Madrid at that age and graduated at 16, not having yet begun her performing career. She has never clarified the obvious discrepancy.Cugat Weds Charo in Las Vegas, nytimes.com; accessed March 13, 2016.John Beck. \\"Ageless persona: Vegas headliner Charo thrills fans at Sonoma County Fair: Cuchi-cuchi time at the fair\\", The Press Democrat (Santa Rosa, California), August 1, 2002, page B1.

From 1965 to 1967 she performed on The Ed Sullivan Show four times with her husband, Xavier Cugat, and his orchestra. She began appearing on Laugh-In in 1968, appearing in segments lasting a few minutes near the end of each episode with Dan Rowan and Dick Martin. Her almost complete lack of fluency in the English language was played as a comic focus, with the two hosts laughing at her mangled English.

Experimental verification of violation of the inequalities is seen as experimental confirmation that nature cannot be described by local hidden variables theories. CHSH stands for John Clauser, Michael Horne, Abner Shimony, and Richard Holt, who described it in a much-cited paper published in 1969 (Clauser et al., 1969). They derived the CHSH inequality, which, as with John Bell's original inequality (Bell, 1964),, reproduced as Ch. 2 of is a constraint on the statistics of \\"coincidences\\" in a Bell test experiment which is necessarily true if there exist underlying local hidden variables (local realism). This constraint can, on the other hand, be infringed by quantum mechanics.  Statement  The usual form of the CHSH inequality is where a and a‚Ä≤ are detector settings on side A, b and b‚Ä≤ on side B, the four combinations being tested in separate subexperiments. The terms E(a, b) etc. are the quantum correlations of the particle pairs, where the quantum correlation is defined to be the expectation value of the product of the \\"outcomes\\" of the experiment, i.e. the statistical average of A(a)¬∑B(b), where A and B are the separate outcomes, using the coding +1 for the '+' channel and ‚àí1 for the '‚àí' channel. Clauser et al.'s 1969 derivation was oriented towards the use of \\"two-channel\\" detectors, and indeed it is for these that it is generally used, but under their method the only possible outcomes were +1 and ‚àí1\\\\. In order to adapt to real situations, which at the time meant the use of polarised light and single-channel polarisers, they had to interpret '‚àí' as meaning \\"non-detection in the '+' channel\\", i.e. either '‚àí' or nothing. They did not in the original article discuss how the two-channel inequality could be applied in real experiments with real imperfect detectors, though it was later proved (Bell, 1971)J. S. Bell, in Foundations of Quantum Mechanics, Proceedings of the International School of Physics ‚ÄúEnrico Fermi‚Äù, Course XLIX, B. d‚ÄôEspagnat (Ed.) (Academic, New York, 1971), p. 171 and Appendix B. Pages 171-81 are reproduced as Ch. 4 of J. S. Bell, Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics (Cambridge University Press 1987) that the inequality itself was equally valid. The occurrence of zero outcomes, though, means it is no longer so obvious how the values of E are to be estimated from the experimental data. The mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics predicts a maximum value for S of 2 (Tsirelson's bound), which is greater than 2, and CHSH violations are therefore predicted by the theory of quantum mechanics. = A typical CHSH experiment = Schematic of a \\"two-channel\\" Bell test The source S produces pairs of photons, sent in opposite directions. Each photon encounters a two-channel polariser whose orientation can be set by the experimenter. Emerging signals from each channel are detected and coincidences counted by the coincidence monitor CM. In practice most actual experiments have used light rather than the electrons that Bell originally had in mind. The property of interest is, in the best known experiments (Aspect, 1981-2), the polarisation direction, though other properties can be used. The diagram shows a typical optical experiment. Coincidences (simultaneous detections) are recorded, the results being categorised as '++', '+‚àí', '‚àí+' or '‚àí‚àí' and corresponding counts accumulated. Four separate subexperiments are conducted, corresponding to the four terms E(a, b) in the test statistic S (, above). The settings a, a‚Ä≤, b and b‚Ä≤ are generally in practice chosen to be 0, 45¬∞, 22.5¬∞ and 67.5¬∞ respectively -- the \\"Bell test angles\\" -- these being the ones for which the QM formula gives the greatest violation of the inequality. For each selected value of a and b, the numbers of coincidences in each category \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ N_{++}, N_{--}, N_{+-}, N_{-+} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} are recorded. The experimental estimate for E(a, b) is then calculated as: {N_{++} + N_{+-} + N_{-+}+ N_{--}}}} Once all the E's have been estimated, an experimental estimate of S () can be found. If it is numerically greater than 2 it has infringed the CHSH inequality and the experiment is declared to have supported the QM (Quantum Mechanics) prediction and ruled out all local hidden variable theories. The CHSH paper lists many preconditions (or \\"reasonable and/or presumable assumptions\\") to derive the simplified theorem and formula. For example, for the method to be valid, it has to be assumed that the detected pairs are a fair sample of those emitted. In actual experiments, detectors are never 100% efficient, so that only a sample of the emitted pairs are detected. A subtle, related requirement is that the hidden variables do not influence or determine detection probability in a way that would lead to different samples at each arm of the experiment.  Derivation  The original 1969 derivation will not be given here since it is not easy to follow and involves the assumption that the outcomes are all +1 or ‚àí1, never zero. Bell's 1971 derivation is more general. He effectively assumes the \\"Objective Local Theory\\" later used by Clauser and Horne (Clauser, 1974). It is assumed that any hidden variables associated with the detectors themselves are independent on the two sides and can be averaged out from the start. Another derivation of interest is given in Clauser and Horne's 1974 paper, in which they start from the CH74 inequality. It would appear from both these later derivations that the only assumptions really needed for the inequality itself (as opposed to the method of estimation of the test statistic) are that the distribution of the possible states of the source remains constant and the detectors on the two sides act independently. = Bell's 1971 derivation = The following is based on page 37 of Bell's Speakable and Unspeakable (Bell, 1971), the main change being to use the symbol ‚ÄòE‚Äô instead of ‚ÄòP‚Äô for the expected value of the quantum correlation. This avoids any implication that the quantum correlation is itself a probability. We start with the standard assumption of independence of the two sides, enabling us to obtain the joint probabilities of pairs of outcomes by multiplying the separate probabilities, for any selected value of the \\"hidden variable\\" Œª. Œª is assumed to be drawn from a fixed distribution of possible states of the source, the probability of the source being in the state Œª for any particular trial being given by the density function œÅ(Œª), the integral of which over the complete hidden variable space is 1. We thus assume we can write: :E(a, b) = \\\\int \\\\underline{A}(a, \\\\lambda) \\\\underline{B}(b, \\\\lambda) \\\\rho(\\\\lambda) d\\\\lambda where _A_ and _B_ are the average values of the outcomes. Since the possible values of A and B are ‚àí1, 0 and +1, it follows that: Then, if a, a‚Ä≤, b and b‚Ä≤ are alternative settings for the detectors, :\\\\begin{align} &E;(a, b) - E\\\\left(a, b'\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ ={} &\\\\int \\\\left[ \\\\underline{A}(a, \\\\lambda) \\\\underline{B}(b, \\\\lambda) - \\\\underline{A}(a, \\\\lambda) \\\\underline{B}\\\\left(b', \\\\lambda\\\\right) \\\\right] \\\\rho(\\\\lambda) d\\\\lambda \\\\\\\\\\\\ ={} &\\\\int \\\\left[ \\\\underline{A}(a, \\\\lambda) \\\\underline{B}(b, \\\\lambda) - \\\\underline{A}(a, \\\\lambda) \\\\underline{B}\\\\left(b', \\\\lambda\\\\right) \\\\pm \\\\underline{A}(a, \\\\lambda) \\\\underline{B}(b, \\\\lambda) \\\\underline{A}\\\\left(a', \\\\lambda\\\\right) \\\\underline{B}\\\\left(b', \\\\lambda\\\\right) \\\\mp \\\\underline{A}(a, \\\\lambda) \\\\underline{B}(b, \\\\lambda) \\\\underline{A}\\\\left(a', \\\\lambda\\\\right) \\\\underline{B}\\\\left(b', \\\\lambda\\\\right) \\\\right] \\\\rho(\\\\lambda) d\\\\lambda\\\\\\\\\\\\ ={} &\\\\int \\\\underline{A}(a, \\\\lambda) \\\\underline{B}(b, \\\\lambda) \\\\left[1 \\\\pm \\\\underline{A}\\\\left(a', \\\\lambda\\\\right) \\\\underline{B}\\\\left(b', \\\\lambda\\\\right) \\\\right] \\\\rho(\\\\lambda) d\\\\lambda - \\\\int \\\\underline{A}(a, \\\\lambda) \\\\underline{B}\\\\left(b', \\\\lambda\\\\right) \\\\left[1 \\\\pm \\\\underline{A}\\\\left(a', \\\\lambda\\\\right) \\\\underline{B}(b, \\\\lambda) \\\\right] \\\\rho(\\\\lambda) d\\\\lambda \\\\end{align} Taking absolute values of both sides, and applying the triangle inequality to the right-hand side, we obtain :\\\\left E(a, b) - E\\\\left(a, b'\\\\right) \\\\right \\\\leq \\\\left \\\\int \\\\underline{A}(a, \\\\lambda) \\\\underline{B}(b, \\\\lambda) \\\\left[ 1 \\\\pm \\\\underline{A}\\\\left(a', \\\\lambda\\\\right) \\\\underline{B}\\\\left(b', \\\\lambda\\\\right) \\\\right] \\\\rho(\\\\lambda) d\\\\lambda \\\\right + \\\\left \\\\int \\\\underline{A}(a, \\\\lambda) \\\\underline{B}\\\\left(b', \\\\lambda\\\\right) \\\\left[1 \\\\pm \\\\underline{A}\\\\left(a', \\\\lambda\\\\right) \\\\underline{B}(b, \\\\lambda) \\\\right] \\\\rho(\\\\lambda) d\\\\lambda \\\\right We use the fact that \\\\left[ 1 \\\\pm \\\\underline{A}\\\\left(a', \\\\lambda\\\\right) \\\\underline{B}\\\\left(b', \\\\lambda\\\\right) \\\\right] \\\\rho(\\\\lambda) and \\\\left[ 1 \\\\pm \\\\underline{A}\\\\left(a', \\\\lambda\\\\right) \\\\underline{B}(b, \\\\lambda) \\\\right] \\\\rho(\\\\lambda) are both non-negative to rewrite the right-hand side of this as : \\\\int \\\\left \\\\underline{A}(a, \\\\lambda) \\\\underline{B}(b, \\\\lambda) \\\\right \\\\left \\\\left[ 1 \\\\pm \\\\underline{A}\\\\left(a', \\\\lambda\\\\right) \\\\underline{B}\\\\left(b', \\\\lambda\\\\right)\\\\right] \\\\rho(\\\\lambda) d\\\\lambda \\\\right + \\\\int \\\\left \\\\underline{A}(a, \\\\lambda) \\\\underline{B}(b', \\\\lambda) \\\\right \\\\left \\\\left[ 1 \\\\pm \\\\underline{A}\\\\left(a', \\\\lambda\\\\right) \\\\underline{B}(b, \\\\lambda) \\\\right] \\\\rho(\\\\lambda) d\\\\lambda \\\\right By (), this must be less than or equal to :\\\\int \\\\left[ 1 \\\\pm \\\\underline{A}\\\\left(a', \\\\lambda\\\\right) \\\\underline{B}\\\\left(b', \\\\lambda\\\\right) \\\\right] \\\\rho(\\\\lambda) d\\\\lambda + \\\\int \\\\left[ 1 \\\\pm \\\\underline{A}\\\\left(a', \\\\lambda\\\\right) \\\\underline{B}(b, \\\\lambda) \\\\right] \\\\rho(\\\\lambda) d\\\\lambda which, using the fact that the integral of œÅ(Œª) is 1, is equal to :2 \\\\pm \\\\left[ \\\\int \\\\underline{A}\\\\left(a', \\\\lambda\\\\right) \\\\underline{B}\\\\left(b', \\\\lambda\\\\right) \\\\rho(\\\\lambda) d\\\\lambda + \\\\int \\\\underline{A}\\\\left(a', \\\\lambda\\\\right) \\\\underline{B}(b, \\\\lambda) \\\\rho(\\\\lambda) d\\\\lambda \\\\right] which is equal to 2 \\\\pm \\\\left[ E\\\\left(a', b'\\\\right) + E\\\\left(a', b\\\\right) \\\\right]. Putting this together with the left-hand side, we have: :\\\\left E(a, b) - E\\\\left(a, b'\\\\right) \\\\right \\\\; \\\\leq 2 \\\\; \\\\pm \\\\left[ E\\\\left(a', b'\\\\right) + E\\\\left(a', b\\\\right) \\\\right] which means that the left-hand side is less than or equal to both 2 + \\\\left[ E\\\\left(a', b'\\\\right) + E\\\\left(a', b\\\\right) \\\\right] and 2 - \\\\left[ E\\\\left(a', b'\\\\right) + E\\\\left(a', b\\\\right) \\\\right]. That is: :\\\\left E(a, b) - E\\\\left(a, b'\\\\right) \\\\right \\\\; \\\\leq \\\\; 2 - \\\\left E\\\\left(a', b'\\\\right) + E\\\\left(a', b\\\\right) \\\\right from which we obtain :2 \\\\;\\\\geq\\\\; \\\\left E(a, b) - E\\\\left(a, b'\\\\right) \\\\right + \\\\left E\\\\left(a', b'\\\\right) + E\\\\left(a', b\\\\right) \\\\right \\\\;\\\\geq\\\\; \\\\left E(a, b) - E\\\\left(a, b'\\\\right) + E\\\\left(a', b'\\\\right) + E\\\\left(a', b\\\\right) \\\\right (by the triangle inequality again), which is the CHSH inequality. = Derivation from Clauser and Horne's 1974 inequality = In their 1974 paper, Clauser and Horne show that the CHSH inequality can be derived from the CH74 one. As they tell us, in a two-channel experiment the CH74 single-channel test is still applicable and provides four sets of inequalities governing the probabilities p of coincidences. Working from the inhomogeneous version of the inequality, we can write: :\\\\- 1 \\\\; \\\\leq \\\\; p_{jk}(a, b) - p_{jk}(a, b') + p_{jk}(a', b) + p_{jk}(a', b') - p_{jk}(a') - p_{jk}(b) \\\\; \\\\leq \\\\; 0 where j and k are each '+' or '‚àí', indicating which detectors are being considered. To obtain the CHSH test statistic S (), all that is needed is to multiply the inequalities for which j is different from k by ‚àí1 and add these to the inequalities for which j and k are the same.  Experiments using the CHSH test  Many Bell test experiments conducted subsequent to Aspect's second experiment in 1982 have used the CHSH inequality, estimating the terms using (3) and assuming fair sampling. Some dramatic violations of the inequality have been reported. Scientific American reported in its Dec 2018 issue methods for greatly improved experimental applications of CHSH inequality  See also  *Bell test experiments *Correlation does not imply causation *Leggett‚ÄìGarg inequality *Quantum entanglement *Quantum Mechanics  References  Category:Quantum measurement Category:Inequalities ","title":"CHSH inequality"},{"id":"169290","text":"The Vines are an Australian rock band formed in Sydney in 1994. Their sound has been described as a musical hybrid of 1960s garage rock and 1990s alternative rock. The band has been through several line-up changes, with vocalist/guitarist Craig Nicholls serving as the sole constant throughout the band's history. The Vines' success in the Australian recording industry resulted in winning an ARIA Award in 2002, 'Breakthrough Artist ‚Äì Single', for \\"Get Free\\" and receiving five other nominations for their debut album Highly Evolved, plus two further nominations in subsequent years. In 2003, the album went platinum in Australia, and since then the band has released four albums and a best-of compilation from their time at Capitol Records. The Vines have released seven studio albums to date.  History = Formation and early years (1994‚Äì2000) = The original line-up of Rishikesh formed in Sydney in 1994 when vocalist and lead guitarist Craig Nicholls and bass guitarist Patrick Matthews met whilst working at their local McDonald's in the suburb of South Hurstville, New South Wales. They were soon joined by Matthews' school friend David Olliffe on drums. The name \\"Rishikesh\\", suggested by Olliffe, refers to the Indian city where the Beatles visited an ashram in 1968. The local newspapers regularly misprinted the name as \\"Rishi Chasms\\", so Nicholls suggested a new name, \\"the Vines\\", as an homage to his father, who fronted a local band called the Vynes. The group started performing Nirvana and You Am I covers at backyard parties while developing their sound on Nicholls' four- track recorder. Over the next few years, the Vines gigged infrequently and remained relatively unknown, even in their hometown, yet by the beginning of 2001 they had amassed a repertoire of over thirty songs. On the strength of their demo, Rex Records put out what was to be their first single, \\"Factory\\", as a limited seven-inch single. The release became NME's Single of the Week in November 2001. =Highly Evolved, fame and critical acclaim (2001‚Äì2003)= In July 2001, the band flew to Los Angeles to start recording their debut album, Highly Evolved, with Rob Schnapf. David Olliffe was replaced a few months later as a result of increasing record company interest, and the band had sessions with drummers such as Joey Waronker. Their debut single, \\"Factory\\" was released in November 2001 in the UK and gained a good response in the press, with the NME describing their garage rock sound as \\"of the oldest school\\". The band then signed to Heavenly Records in the UK in December 2001 and EMI in Australia in April 2002. The single \\"Highly Evolved\\" earned them more critical acclaim as NME made it a single of the week in March 2002. The single charted in the UK at number 32 on the singles chart and on Australia's ARIAnet top 100 singles chart. The band appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone in October 2002 (the first Australian band to do so since Men at Work in 1983) with the words \\"Rock is Back: Meet the Vines\\" boldly emblazoned underneath. Referred to as the 'The' bands, the Strokes, the Hives, the White Stripes, and the Vines combined \\"old fashioned punk and adrenaline fuelled riffs\\" to be ushered in at the beginning of 2002 as the \\"saviors of rock\\". The release of the album saw more critical success, with the band appearing on the cover of NME. The album reached number 11 in the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 albums chart. The band played high-profile slots on the Late Show with David Letterman and the MTV Video Music Awards. Several more singles were released from the album, including \\"Get Free\\" and \\"Outtathaway!\\". A fourth single, \\"Homesick\\", was released in Australia only. The band went on to win an ARIA Award, 'Breakthrough Artist ‚Äì Single', for \\"Get Free\\" in 2002, and were nominated for \\"Best Group\\", \\"Best Rock Album\\", \\"Best Cover Art\\", and \\"Breakthrough Artist ‚Äì Album\\". Highly Evolved sold 1.5 million copies throughout the world with distribution through Capitol Records. By end of 2003, the album went platinum in Australia. Craig Nicholls realised while touring for the promotion of their debut album, Highly Evolved (July 2002), that they needed an additional guitarist. So Nicholls asked his longtime friend and schoolmate Ryan Griffiths to join. In May 2003, the band went into a studio in Woodstock, New York with Rob Schnapf again on production. While Craig Nicholls had talked of having a highly produced album, he told the Australian edition of Rolling Stone in March 2004 that they decided to stick to a less-is-more philosophy. \\"I wanted it to be ‚Äì in my head ‚Äì something grand, with big ideas and that vision sort of thing. But at the same time, that doesn't mean that something can't be special if it's just simple. Because I think that the songs are the main thing\\". =Winning Days (2004‚Äì2005)= Camden Electric Ballroom, 19 February 2004 Their second album, Winning Days, was released on 29 March 2004 and rose to number 23 in the US. \\"Ride\\" and \\"Winning Days\\" were released as singles in Australia (where they did not chart) and the UK. =Vision Valley and return to the stage (2006‚Äì2007)= In mid-2005, the group announced they were working on their third album, with producer Wayne Connolly. Andy Kent of fellow Australian band You Am I filled in on bass playing duties. In November of that year, the band's management announced they had finished recording all the songs that would appear on the album. \\"Don't Listen to the Radio\\" was released as the album's first single, and was made available for digital download on 7 March on iTunes. The song was used on the soundtrack for the video game FlatOut 2. \\"Gross Out\\" was made available for digital download on 18 March, and was the first song leaked from the album. Vision Valley was released on 1 April 2006 in Australia, 3 April in Europe, and 4 April in the United States. Vision Valley consisted of short, immediate songs; the album running little over 30 minutes in length. \\"Anysound\\" was the second official single from the album, and an animated music video was released exclusively through YouTube. The song was included as a track heard on the in-game radio in the 2007 LucasArts published Thrillville: Off The Rails. \\"Dope Train\\" was released as a third single, with a music video composed of live footage of the band from Big Day Out in 2007. On 19 July 2006, the Vines played a gig at the Annandale Hotel under the name \\"Joe Dirt\\", with a new bassist, Brad Heald, after former bassist Patrick Matthews departed the group. =Melodia (2008)= In 2007, the Vines signed to Ivy League Records for an Australian album deal. The first single preceding the album Melodia was \\"He's a Rocker\\", which was released through iTunes on 3 June 2008 along with two bonus tracks. \\"MerryGoRound\\" was released as a follow-up single for radio airplay in Australia during August 2008. \\"MerryGoRound\\" only received support and backing from Triple J radio. \\"Get Out\\" was released as the third single from Melodia in September 2008 for radio airplay, and a music video was released to coincide with the release of \\"Get Out\\" as a single by Ivy League Records on YouTube. \\"Get Out\\" was featured on the in-game soundtrack of Midnight Club: Los Angeles released in late October 2008 on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 gaming platforms. In October 2008, the Vines commenced a national Australian tour in support of Melodia, playing small venues throughout Australia. In November 2008, the Vines were announced as being part of the line-up for the 2009 Australian Big Day Out, but the band cancelled. =Future Primitive and departure of Griffiths and Rosser (2009‚Äì2012)= On 14 November 2009, the Vines played at the Annandale Hotel, under the alias of the Crimes. They had a support slot with You Am I, playing their back catalogue and a new song from an album due in 2011. The Vines recorded in early 2010. They also played gigs that year, including a set at the Annandale Hotel on 23 June where they debuted new songs \\"Future Primitive\\", \\"Gimme Love\\", and \\"Black Dragon\\". They also played Splendour in the Grass on 1 August and Singfest, a Singapore music festival on 5 August. At the start of September, they supported Powderfinger at the first four shows of their farewell tour. A music video for \\"Gimme Love\\" wrapped filming on 1 March 2011, with the completed video surfacing online through YouTube on 27 March. The music video pays homage to the 2010 film Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. Over a year after its completion, Future Primitive received an official release date through The Daily Telegraph on 3 June 2011. Because the Vines did not have a label at the time of recording, the band members funded the album's recording themselves. Upon the album's completion, the band approached various record labels to see if any were interested in signing the band for its release, explaining the year-long delay between recording and release. In May 2011, the Vines played on-stage with the Dandy Warhols at the Enmore Theatre in Sydney for the song \\"It's a Fast- Driving Rave-Up with The Dandy Warhols\\". The two bands had previously had dinner at the Warhols' studio The Odditorium in 2004, along with the bands Jet and the Strokes. In an interview with Music Feeds at Splendour in the Grass 2011, Nicholls talked about a late 2011 or early 2012 release date for their still unnamed sixth album. On 26 November 2011, rumours on the band's Facebook page suggested that the band had \\"pushed out\\" two of its members. At the 2011 Homebake music festival, the Vines emerged on the main-stage as a three piece, consisting of Nicholls, Heald and drummer Murray Sheridan. The departure of both Griffiths and Rosser was confirmed by Channel V presenter Jane Gazzo, who wrote that the two had been \\"sacked\\" in a Twitter post. Craig's sister, Jess Nicholls, also confirmed their departure via the band's official forum. \\"If any of you were at Homebake yesterday, I'm sure you can agree the set was amazing and sounded better than ever,\\" she wrote. \\"The band has made a creative decision to revert back to a three piece, as they originally started. I know you will probably have a lot of questions but just wanted to say don't fear, this is in no way the end of the Vines!!\\" Nicholls, Heald and Sheridan performed again at Southbound music festival in Perth on 8 January 2012. On 16 March 2012, Rosser announced that he had joined Australian rock band Wolfmother, as their new drummer, on the Faster Louder website. He also claimed that the band had \\"broken up,\\" although \\"Craig [Nicholls] will always write great music in the future and he may choose to carry on under the Vines‚Äô name.\\" =Wicked Nature and White Shadows (2012‚Äì2015)= On 30 March 2012, the Vines' Facebook page changed its profile picture to a single previously unseen promotional photo of Nicholls, implying that he was the only remaining member of the band. Heald confirmed his departure from the band in 2012. A new line- up, consisting of Nicholls, drummer Lachlan West and bassist Tim John, entered the studio to record their sixth album on 20 August 2012 in Sydney's 301 Studio and completed the mixing of the album at the end of 2012. On 18 April 2013, the band's management, Parker & Mr French, announced via their Tumblr page that \\"the new record from the Vines is definitely on the way\\". Additionally, \\"2013 has the Vines sixth album in the incubator and an announcement coming about a new and the first collaborative side project from Craig Nicholls.\\" was written on the band's own section of the Parker & Mr French Tumblr page. West revealed in a June 2013 interview with his other band, Something With Numbers, that two producers have worked on the forthcoming Vines release. Paul McKercher produced the first half of the record and Lachlan Mitchell, who also produced the latest Something With Numbers record, worked on the second half based upon West's recommendation to Nicholls. The article also stated that the new Vines album was \\"due for release in the latter half of this year (2013)\\". However, the year passed with no new material from the band or news as to when the album would be released. On 3 June 2014, a new press shot featuring the new line-up was uploaded to the band's official Facebook page, as well as a new cover photo containing an updated version of the band's original logo. According to a June 2014 Faster Louder article, in addition to the anticipated sixth album, a seventh album was recorded with the new line-up. At the beginning of July 2014, the Vines created a PledgeMusic page for their sixth record Wicked Nature, a double album which was released on 2 September 2014. The lead single \\"Metal Zone\\" was released on July 14. Its music video premiered on Noisy on July 11. In spring of 2015, it was announced that Craig Nicholls started a side project called White Shadows, which focused on electronic music. A debut album for the project, titled Secret Of Life, was later released that year. Its lead single, \\"Give Up Give Out Give In\\", was released on April 9, 2015 with a music video produced. The album featured over 70 different guest musicians. =In Miracle Land and classic line-up reunion (2016‚Äìpresent)= On 25 March 2016, the band changed their profile picture on Facebook to the band's logo. Along with this came a new post featuring a picture of Craig Nicholls in the studio playing guitar with the caption \\"Album #7 coming soon...\\" On 1 April 2016, the first single \\"In Miracle Land\\" was released. In October 2016, the band played three shows in Australia for the 'In Miracle Land' Tour in support of the upcoming album of the same name. During the tour, the band debuted new songs \\"Hate the Sound\\", \\"I Wanna Go Down\\", \\"Broken Heart\\", \\"Sky Gazer\\" and \\"Gone Wander\\". The title track has yet to be performed live. In June 2017, it was announced that Highly Evolved was to be reissued on vinyl to coincide with its 15th anniversary. In May 2018, The Vines' official Facebook page announced that The Vines would be joining Jet as the opener for the two Sydney dates of their Get Born anniversary tour. With the announcement came the news that the shows would be with the line-up of Nicholls, Matthews, Griffiths and Rosser. The shows marked Matthews' first with The Vines in 14 years, and the first in seven years for Griffiths and Rosser. On 31 May 2018, it was announced via Facebook that the album In Miracle Land would be released 29 June 2018. It features the same line-up as Wicked Nature. In November 2019, Sydney band Northlane covered The Vines as a part of triple j's Like a Version segment, performing \\"Get Free.\\"  Musical style  Ex-bassist Matthews believed that Winning Days was a step in a different direction for the band. \\"The themes are more introspective and less wild rock'n'roll\\". Their music also was described by Chart Attack as having \\"neo-psychedelic arrangements\\".  Reception  Upon the release of their debut album, the Vines were hailed as \\"the second coming of Nirvana\\" by the British press; their grungy sound was considered reminiscent of the Seattle scene circa 1991 and Nicholls' erratic on-stage behaviour and raw vocals drew comparisons between him and Kurt Cobain. Highly Evolved became a huge success and their accompanying live shows in the early years were praised as \\"electrifying\\" and \\"sensational\\". Critical reactions to 2004's Winning Days were mixed. Pitchfork's Chris Ott described it as being \\"nothing more than boring and harmlessly vapid\\" and showing \\"only mild promise\\".

Their mainstream success came with the release of the album Veni Vidi Vicious, containing the single \\"Hate to Say I Told You So\\". The band has been acclaimed by music critics as one of the best live rock bands. The Hives have released five studio albums: Barely Legal (1997), Veni Vidi Vicious (2000), Tyrannosaurus Hives (2004), The Black and White Album (2007) and Lex Hives (2012). They have one compilation album, Your New Favourite Band (2001) and they have issued a live DVD, Tussles in Brussels (2005). History=Beginnings of the Hives (1989‚Äì1999)= The band claims it was formed in 1993 (although formed in 1989 under a different name and sound) under the guidance of Randy Fitzsimmons. Fitzsimmons suggested that they form a garage rock band. He gave each band member a letter asking them to start the band. Fitzsimmons allegedly acts as a songwriter and manager for the band. The band recorded a demo titled Sounds Like Sushi in 1994. The following year they were signed to Burning Heart Records, a Swedish independent record label. The following year they released their debut EP Oh Lord! When? How? Almqvist decided to promote the band to Burning Heart. In 1997 they released an album called Barely Legal (an early stage name of guitarist Vigilante Carlstroem), and began touring. The following year they released their second EP A.K.A. I-D-I-O-T. The track \\"The Stomp\\" was featured on the soundtrack of the film RocknRolla. =Veni Vidi Vicious and Your New Favourite Band (2000‚Äì2002)= They released their second studio album Veni Vidi Vicious in April 2000 through Burning Heart Records. The band themselves described the album as being like \\"a velvet glove with brass knuckles, both brutal and sophisticated at the same time\\". The album yielded the singles \\"Hate to Say I Told You So\\", \\"Main Offender\\", \\"Die, All Right!\\", and \\"Supply and Demand.\\" After seeing the video for \\"Hate to Say I Told You So\\" on German TV, Alan McGee (Oasis, Creation Records) decided to sign the band to his newly formed Poptones label. Poptones released the 'best of' compilation Your New Favourite Band in 2001, which proved to be their breakthrough record, reaching No. 7 in the UK album charts. Following the success of the album, the band re-released singles \\"Hate to Say I Told You So\\" and \\"Main Offender\\" which reach numbers No. 23 and No. 24 respectively in the UK Singles chart. The band also re- released Veni Vidi Vicious in the US. \\"The Hives ‚Äî Introduce the Metric System in Time\\" was included on the punk rock sampler album Punk-O-Rama Volume 5 from Epitaph Records. It was during the promotion of Veni Vidi Vicious and Your New Favourite Band that the Hives signed a record deal with Universal Music, reportedly worth $50 million. This led to a dispute between the Hives and Burning Heart, who claimed that the Hives were still contracted to them for one more album. The track \\"Main Offender\\" was featured in the video game Rock Band while \\"Die, All Right!\\" was released as downloadable content for the game's music store on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Wii. =Tyrannosaurus Hives (2003‚Äì2006)= After extensive touring, the band retreated to Fagersta to record their third album. The result was 2004's Tyrannosaurus Hives, their first new material in four years. The album includes the hit singles \\"Walk Idiot Walk,\\" which debuted at No. 13 on the UK singles charts, \\"Two-Timing Touch and Broken Bones,\\" another top 50 hit, and \\"A Little More for Little You.\\" The tracks \\"B is for Brutus\\" and \\"Uptight\\" were featured in the game Gran Turismo 4, and \\"No Pun Intended\\" was featured in the game SSX on Tour. In 2006, their song \\"Diabolic Scheme\\" was used in the vampire film Frostbiten, marking the first time a Hives song was used in a major motion picture. (\\"Hate to say I told you so\\" featured in the 2002 'Spider-man' movie starring Tobey Maguire) The Hives won \\"Best International Band\\" and \\"Best Dressed Band\\" at the 2003 NME awards. The band also won five prestigious Swedish Grammis for Tyrannosaurus Hives at the 23rd annual Swedish Grammis Awards, presented on 7 February 2005 for \\"Artist of the Year\\"; \\"Rock Group of the Year\\"; \\"Album of the Year\\"; \\"Producer of the Year\\" (with collaborator, Pelle Gunnerfeldt); and \\"Walk Idiot Walk\\" took home the MTV \\"Best Music Video\\" prize. =The Black and White Album (2007‚Äì2011)= The Hives' official website was overhauled in the second week of August 2007, with a grungier, \\"emergency broadcast\\" layout. The new site revealed the album's cover and the title of the first single, \\"Tick Tick Boom\\", with a release date of 14 August in the United States and 8 October in the United Kingdom. The release dates for the new record, The Black and White Album, were 15 October in the UK on Polydor and 13 November in the US on A&M;/Octone in 2007. It was mostly recorded in Oxford, Mississippi, Miami, and in their native Sweden. The Hives were featured in a Finish Line commercial performing \\"Tick Tick Boom\\", as well as a Nike commercial featuring the song \\"Return The Favour\\". \\"Tick Tick Boom\\" was also used in many different advertisements including: the 2007 season of the NFL Network, commercials for the CBS series Jericho, and the USA series Burn Notice, as well as the films Jumper (2008), MacGruber, and Get Smart, and was also the official theme song for WWE Survivor Series 2007. The Hives song \\"Try It Again\\" was featured in the trailer for the US film Get Him to the Greek. On 9 January 2008, the band received the \\"Best Live Act\\" award at the Swedish Grammis. The Hives performed at the 2008 NHL All-Star Game in Atlanta, Georgia, singing \\"Tick Tick Boom\\" during the players' presentation. On 2 July 2010, the band released an EP titled Tarred and Feathered, which covered \\"Civilization's Dying\\" by Zero Boys, \\"Nasty Secretary\\" by Joy Rider & Avis Davis and \\"Early Morning Wake Up Call\\" by Flash and the Pan.TT Spektra 24 June 2010. \\"Nasty Secretary\\" is also a song on the US release of the Gran Turismo 5 soundtrack. On 9 January 2011, Nicholaus Arson wrote another short diary entry on the band's website saying that they had recorded some new songs before Christmas, and were planning to continue recording throughout January. The album's first single, \\"Tick Tick Boom\\", was featured in the setlist for the music-simulation video game Lego: Rock Band. =Lex Hives and line-up change (2012‚Äìpresent)= Santiago, Chile, in 2013. On 12 March 2012, the band announced their fifth full-length album, Lex Hives. The album was released on their own label, Disque Hives on 1 June in Sweden/GSA, 4 June in the UK, and 5 June in the USA and Canada, comprising twelve self-produced tracks, with a deluxe version containing bonus tracks produced by Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme. The first single to be released from the album, \\"Go Right Ahead,\\" was made available for public streaming alongside this announcement. Five teaser videos were posted on their official YouTube channel, each showing a member of the band playing their part of the song in the lead up to the announcement. The song was also played live at the Norwegian/Swedish talkshow \\"Skavlan\\", broadcast on 30 March 2012. After a run of Californian live shows and the two weekends at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival (15 and 22 April), the band performed on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on 23 April 2012. The music video for \\"Go Right Ahead\\" was released on 9 May 2012. Since its release, \\"Come On!\\" has been used as the theme for Xbox One's Invitation commercials, as well as in an episode of Workaholics and in the documentary The Crash Reel. The song \\"1000 Answers,\\" meanwhile, was featured on the soundtrack of the video game by EA Sports, FIFA 12. Due to health reasons, Dr. Matt Destruction left the band in late 2013 and was replaced by Randy bassist Johan Gustafsson, who then went by the stage name The Johan and Only.Gustafsson replaces Bernvall in 2013 as Bernvall leaves for health reasons rollingstone.com Retrieved:2014-03-29 On 13 February 2015, the band released the single \\"Blood Red Moon\\". The single \\"I'm Alive\\" was released digitally on 17 May 2019, with a limited edition 7-inch vinyl available on 28 June. This was followed by another single later that year, \\"Good Samaritan.\\" The band toured the US in 2019 alongside fellow Swedish band Refused, with the run of dates dubbed the Scream Team Tour. Chris Dangerous took a hiatus from the band to recover from surgery, and was replaced on the tour by former Queens of the Stone Age drummer Joey Castillo. The Hives' first live album, Live at Third Man Records, was released on 25 September 2020. Collaborations The Hives completed recording vocals and guitar in late November 2006 for a song called \\"Throw It On Me\\", a collaboration with hip-hop producer Timbaland. The song was included on his album, Timbaland Presents Shock Value, released on 3 April 2007. They also performed in a music video for the track. The Hives also have recently spoken of a collaboration with Jack White's the Raconteurs on a song for their new album, originally entitled \\"Footsteps\\", however it was later revealed that Howlin' Pelle had literally recorded footsteps. Howlin' Pelle also did a collaboration with Swedish rock artist Moneybrother, a cover of an Operation Ivy song \\"Freeze Up\\". They used Swedish lyrics and called it \\"\\", which translates as \\"I Won't Sign Anything\\". The band members contributed to \\"Time For Some Action\\" and \\"Windows\\" on N.E.R.D.'s \\"Seeing Sounds\\" album, with Pelle Almqvist providing guest vocals on \\"Time For Some Action\\".

Randy Fitzsimmons is a registered pseudonym for Niklas Almqvist. The Hives live show has been highly rated, with Spin magazine rating them 8th best in rock music. Pelle is known for his \\"colourful idiocy\\" on stage. When asked about their efforts to connect with the audience, Chris Dangerous replied that \\"there are so many bands out there that don‚Äôt say a word to the crowd. I don‚Äôt get it. They don‚Äôt even look at the audience and that‚Äôs ridiculous\\". The Hives always dressed in matching black-and-white tuxedos because \\"it makes [them] look like [they] belong together\\".

The term most often refers to audio recordings, but also includes video performances. Starting with vinyl releases in the 1970s, through CD issues in the late 1980s, and continuing with digital downloads starting in the mid 1990s, the Beatles have been, and continue to be, among the most bootlegged artists. Bootleg recordings arise from a multitude of sources, including radio and TV broadcast performances, live shows, studio outtakes and session tapes, alternate mixes, test discs, and home demos. The largest single source of Beatles bootleg material is the set of Nagra audio tapes from the 1969 filming of the Get Back / Let It Be rehearsal and recording sessions. Historical overview The 1970s saw the first Beatle bootlegs issued on vinyl records. The first Beatles bootleg was Kum Back, issued around January 1970 in a plain white sleeve with plain white labels and no mention of a record company. This vinyl bootleg was based on an acetate of one of the early rough mixes by Glyn Johns of the Get Back album (which would later become Let It Be).Unterberger (2006), pp. 282‚Äì283. John Lennon may have been the unintentional source for one of the Get Back bootlegs; Lennon said: \\"They say it came from an acetate that I gave to someone who then went and broadcast it as being an advance pressing or something.\\"Unterberger (2006), p. 371. Other notable bootlegs to appear in the early 1970s were Yellow Matter Custard, containing 14 BBC Radio performances from 1963, (originally these tracks were thought to be from the Decca audition of January 1962, and Lennon himself told McCartney about the album) Unterberger (2006), pp. 26‚Äì29. and Sweet Apple Trax, a two-volume four-disc collection of songs and jams from the Get Back rehearsal sessions first issued in 1974.Heylin (2004), p. 207. In 1977, a copy of the Beatles' Decca audition tape was bought by a collector, who released the songs over a series of seven 45 rpm singles pressed on coloured vinyl with full colour picture sleeves. Bootleggers of this era often copied and repackaged each other's releases, so popular titles often appeared from more than one bootleg label. The biggest labels for Beatles material in the 1970s were Kornyfone (TAKRL), ContraBand, Trademark of Quality and Wizardo.Reinhart (1981), pp. xix‚Äìxxi. EMI had planned to release an album of alternate takes and previously unreleased songs by the Beatles in 1985 called Sessions, but the Beatles objected after it had been compiled; by the end of the year, bootleg copies were widely available.Unterberger (2006), pp. 365‚Äì366. During the cataloguing and review of the EMI archives in the early 1980s in preparation for the Sessions album and a multimedia show given at Abbey Road Studios, it is suspected that high quality copies of some of the material were surreptitiously made. This may have been the source for the Ultra Rare Trax CD series from Swingin' Pig that started appearing in 1988, which provided takes never previously bootlegged in clarity that rivalled official releases.Heylin (2004), p. 209. The late 1980s also saw the emergence of Yellow Dog, a label specialising in Beatles studio outtakes, who released the CD series Unsurpassed Masters in quality similar to Ultra Rare Trax; Yellow Dog, like Swingin' Pig's parent company Perfect Beat, was registered in Luxembourg, which had the most liberal copyright laws among EU countries.Heylin (2004), pp. 229‚Äì231. Yellow Dog released Unsurpassed Demos in 1991, featuring 22 songs from the 1968 Kinfauns (Esher) demos, only some of which had been previously made public during the radio series The Lost Lennon Tapes that debuted in 1988. In 1993, a nine CD box set of the Beatles' BBC radio performances was released in Italy by Great Dane. The official Live at the BBC and Anthology releases in 1994‚Äì1996 covered much of the highlights of previously bootlegged material, in sound quality that most bootlegs could not match. However, new bootlegs continued to appear, with bootleggers including the word \\"anthology\\" in the title of many of their collections. Starting in 1999, Silent Sea issued a series of CD-Rs, featuring recompiled studio outtakes with commercial-quality packaging and liner notes.Heylin (2004), pp. 309‚Äì310. In 2000, the Vigotone label followed up their earlier eight-CD package of Get Back session recordings with a seventeen-CD collection called Thirty Days.Heylin (2004), p. 277. In the early 2000s, the DVD format enhanced the availability of Beatles bootleg videos, covering filmed concerts, TV appearances, promotional films, and even rare clips and outtakes.Unterberger (2006), p. 368. In 2017, the eight-CD box set The Lost Album brings together for the first time almost 100% of the Beatles' unpublished compositions never officially released.https://www.discogs.com/The-Beatles-The-Lost- Album/release/11360053 In 2019/2020 The Lost Album II, The Lost Album Two and a Half, The Last Lost Album and The Lost Album V complete all the Beatles unpublished compositions, including improvisations, jam, unfinished compositions, covers and other unpublished materials.https://www.discogs.com/The-Beatles-The-Lost-Album- II/release/13140476https://www.discogs.com/The-Beatles-The-Last-Lost- Album/release/14533150https://www.discogs.com/pt_BR/The-Beatles-The-Lost- Album-Vol-V-/release/15295943 The availability of high-speed Internet has transformed the bootlegging industry. The Purple Chick label has assembled and digitally fine-tuned many comprehensive themed packages, including individual studio album sessions, the Get Back sessions, and the BBC performances, all distributed free through various fan trading sites online. Author Richie Unterberger noted that it is \\"now theoretically possible to assemble a complete collection of the circulating unreleased Beatles recordings without ever buying a bootleg.\\" Commonly bootlegged material Several books have been devoted to comprehensively documenting Beatles bootlegs; the following is a list of some of the most common or notable bootlegged recordings by the Beatles. =The Quarrymen / Silver Beatles era (1957‚Äì1960)= Other than the commercially released songs with Tony Sheridan issued on In the Beginning (Circa 1960), only three recordings made by the group prior to 1962 have become public.Unterberger (2006), pp. 4‚Äì10. * The Quarrymen show, 6 July 1957. The Quarrymen played a show for the Woolton f√™te at St Peter's Parish Church, notable as the day that Paul McCartney was first introduced to Lennon by a mutual friend, Ivan Vaughan. In 1994, Bob Molyneux, a retired policeman, rediscovered a reel-to-reel tape he had made of the show while experimenting with a Grundig portable tape recorder. The tape contained a poor quality recording of the Quarrymen performances of Lonnie Donegan's \\"Puttin' On the Style\\" and Elvis Presley's \\"Baby, Let's Play House\\". A thirty-second excerpt of \\"Putting on the Style\\" was released to promote the tape's auction at Sotheby's later that year; the tape was bought by EMI for ¬£78,500, becoming the most expensive recording ever sold at auction. EMI decided the recording was not of sufficient quality to include in Anthology. After extensive audio restoration, excerpts from both songs were included in the BBC radio documentary The Day John Met Paul, broadcast on 26 June 2007. * The Quarrymen acetate, 1958. on July 12, 1958, The Quarrymen paid to record themselves at Phillips' Sound Recording Services in Liverpool, performing \\"That'll Be the Day\\" and \\"In Spite of All the Danger\\". These were included on Anthology 1, although the latter song was edited. * Home rehearsals, 1960. More than one hour of the band's home rehearsals from 1960 have appeared on bootlegs, although the recording's date and location are uncertain. McCartney once said that it was taped at his home in April 1960;Unterberger (2006), p. 7. the recording may also originate from two separate sessions a few months apart.Winn (2008), pp. 2‚Äì4. Three of the songs were included on Anthology 1. The recording also featured early versions of songs that the Beatles would later record in the studio (\\"Matchbox\\", \\"One After 909\\", \\"I'll Follow the Sun\\"). Other songs that were recorded during these rehearsals include \\"Well, Darlin'\\", \\"Hello Little Girl\\", \\"That's When Your Heartaches Begin\\", \\"Wildcat\\", \\"I'll Always Be in Love with You\\", \\"Some Days\\", \\"Hallelujah I Love Her So\\", \\"The World Is Waiting for the Sunrise\\", \\"You Must Write Every Day\\", \\"Movin' and Groovin'\\", and \\"Ramrod\\". A collection of all these recordings were released on the bootleg recording Lapis Lazuli, featuring a longer version of ‚ÄúPuttin‚Äô on the Style‚Äù and all of the Beatles home recordings made in early 1960. =Decca audition (1962)= The Beatles performed fifteen songs that were recorded at their audition for Decca Records on 1 January 1962 (three Lennon‚ÄìMcCartney compositions and twelve cover versions). Five of these songs were included on Anthology 1. Fourteen of the fifteen tracks appeared on a series of coloured vinyl singles with picture sleeves, released in 1978 on the Deccagone label through Strawberry Fields Forever, Joe Pope's fanzine. The following year, all fifteen tracks appeared on the Circuit Records bootleg album The Decca Tapes. Due to the questionable copyright status of these performances (recorded prior to the group's EMI contract), the Decca audition was commercially distributed in various configurations starting in 1981; some of these \\"grey market\\" albums omitted the three Lennon‚ÄìMcCartney songs. By the late 1980s, legal action by the Beatles had halted commercial availability of the albums.Unterberger (2006), p. 23. In addition to continued inclusion on bootlegs, a small US record label issued the songs on CD through mail order in 2007 as The Lost Decca Sessions, which it described as legal and licensed. =Cavern Club rehearsals and TV shoot (1962)= Sometime between August and December 1962, the Beatles recorded themselves rehearsing at the Cavern Club, performing \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\", \\"One After 909\\" (two versions), and \\"Catswalk\\" (two versions).Unterberger (2006), pp. 36‚Äì37. On August 22, 1962, a crew from Granada Television shot footage of the band performing live at the Cavern for use in the television show Scene at 6:30; the crew filmed two takes of the band performing \\"Some Other Guy.\\" The following month, on September 5, a Granada sound crew returned to capture better audio of the band to sync to the film footage, as they felt the audio from the original shoot was not of satisfactory quality. A new recording of \\"Some Other Guy\\" and a recording of \\"Kansas City/Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey!\\" come from this performance. The shoot constitutes the earliest professional film footage of the Beatles, and would have been the Beatles' first appearance on television, but the footage was shelved for over a year, and was first broadcast after the Beatles had achieved nationwide success. The video has been seen on The Beatles Anthology and other documentary sources, and audio from both dates have circulated amongst bootleggers. =Star-Club performances (1962)= As the Beatles were concluding their final two-week Hamburg engagement in late December 1962, portions of their performances were taped by Star-Club stage manager Adrian Barber; the tapes were acquired by Ted \\"Kingsize\\" Taylor, the leader of KingsizeTaylor and The Dominoes at the club.Unterberger (2006), pp. 37‚Äì42. Eventually Taylor sold the tapes, which formed the basis of the double album Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962, released in 1977 by Lingasong Records. The liner notes for the initial release falsely implied that the recordings had been made in the spring of 1962, prior to the Beatles' EMI contract, on a night when Ringo Starr happened to be sitting in for Pete Best. In commentary for a lawsuit to block the album's release, John Lennon wrote, \\"the sleeve note, apart from being inaccurate, seems to have been written with a court case in mind.\\" The Beatles lost their case, so the album was viewed as a legitimate release. The thirty songs contained on the initial releases were re-licensed over the following two decades to multiple record labels, most notably Sony Music, which packaged the songs in CD form in 1991 (although the product was withdrawn the following year as legal action was pending from the Beatles). After another lawsuit by the Beatles, Lingasong agreed in 1998 to hand over the original tapes and stop all sales. The sound quality of the tape is poor, with the vocals in particular sounding \\"muffled and distant\\" at best. The Beatles display a rawness that matches the raucous Hamburg atmosphere. While the Beatles would later record many of the thirty songs in the studio or perform them for the BBC, nine of the songs would never be officially released in another version. Additional material from the Star- Club tapes has been bootlegged, including \\"Road Runner\\", \\"Money (That's What I Want)\\" (with Tony Sheridan singing lead), a portion of \\"Red Hot\\", and alternate performances of several songs. =The BBC sessions (1962‚Äì1965)= The Beatles performed for fifty-two BBC Radio programmes, beginning with an appearance on the series Teenager's Turn‚ÄîHere We Go, recorded on 7 March 1962, and ending with the special The Beatles Invite You to Take a Ticket to Ride, recorded on 26 May 1965; in total, 275 performances of 88 different songs were broadcast. Early bootlegs of some of the performances were based on low- quality home recordings of the broadcasts from the radio. It was not the BBC's practice to archive either the session tapes or the shows' master tapes, but many good quality distribution copies were found in various BBC departments during research for BBC radio specials produced in the 1980s. Increasingly comprehensive collections of the BBC performances were bootlegged in the 1980s and early 1990s. The most notable of these was The Complete BBC Sessions, a nine CD box set released in 1993 by Great Dane in Italy, where copyright protection for the broadcasts had expired; The widespread availability of good quality bootlegs prompted Apple's own release of BBC performances in 1994, the two CD set Live at the BBC. The set included 30 of the 36 songs that the Beatles never performed on their studio albums, plus 26 other songs and dialogue among the group members and the radio hosts. In 1999, a 10 CD box set The Complete BBC Sessions 1962-1966 was released in Japan by Secret TraxHeylin (2004), p. 310. which was soon followed by 3 CD set Attack of the Filler BEEBS! on the same label featuring additions to the box set. Starting in the 2000s, the popularity of digital downloads through BitTorrent made it possible to replace physical media with virtual box sets of BBC material provided by fans for fans made available free of charge. In 2004, Purple Chick released The Complete BBC Sessions Upgraded as a digital set of ten audio CDs plus one multimedia CD. In 2010, Hobnail released a virtual 13 disc release Unsurpassed Broadcasts. 2015 saw the release of The BBC Archives, by an anonymous source. This set of 23 virtual CDs and one virtual DVD contains all of the available BBC material in the best quality, as well as some previously unreleased radio shows and upgraded material. =Studio outtakes and alternate mixes (1962‚Äì1970)= A large number of Beatles studio outtakes are available on bootlegs, ranging from complete session tapes‚Äîfor example, the morning sessions for the Please Please Me album‚Äîto more fragmentary samplings, or alternate mixes and performances derived from acetates. The first studio outtake to appear on bootleg was the White Album outtake \\"What's The New Mary Jane\\" in 1972, which fell into the hands of bootleggers via an acetate that Lennon had traded to a friend. In 1977, rough mixes from acetates of \\"I Am the Walrus\\" and \\"The Fool on the Hill\\" appeared on bootlegs after being played on a Radio Luxembourg broadcast. After the Beatles' EMI contract expired in 1976, the company began assessing the band's unreleased material for a future release. The first batch of songs to leak came from an in-house compilation cassette that contained \\"Leave My Kitten Alone\\", \\"One After 909\\" (from 1963), \\"If You've Got Trouble\\", \\"Christmas Time (Is Here Again)\\", \\"That Means a Lot\\", \\"Come and Get It\\", \\"Dig a Pony\\" (unedited version), and two medleys from the Get Back / Let It Be sessions: \\"Rip It Up / Shake, Rattle and Roll\\" and \\"Not Fade Away / Bo Diddley\\". In 1981, in-house engineer John Barrett was given the task of cataloguing the complete collection of tapes from the band's seven- year career with EMI. This led to two projects: a public audio-visual presentation at Abbey Road Studios called The Beatles Live at Abbey Road (which opened on 18 July 1983) and a planned outtakes album which was to be called Sessions. In addition to some of the songs included on the previously leaked compilation tape, Sessions added \\"Not Guilty\\", \\"What's the New Mary Jane\\", \\"How Do You Do It?\\", \\"B√©same Mucho\\", \\"Mailman, Bring Me No More Blues\\", \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" (demo), and early takes of \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\\" and \\"I'm Looking Through You\\". Shortly before the album's scheduled 1985 release, it was vetoed by the surviving members of the band; but both audience recordings of the Abbey Road presentation and the leaked promos of Sessions became available to bootleggers. These songs appeared on bootleg series such as Ultra-Rare Trax and Unsurpassed Masters, along with other material presumably copied while preparing these projects. Most of the aforementioned tracks were officially released on the Anthology albums in 1995 and 1996. New Beatles studio outtakes continue to occasionally appear; in February 2009, a complete 10:46 recording of ‚ÄúRevolution 1 (Take 20)‚Äù from the White Album sessions was released on the bootleg Revolution: Take... Your Knickers Off!. This version begins with Lennon jokingly counting that way. =Live concerts (1963‚Äì1966)= Many of the Beatles' concert performances have appeared on bootleg albums. The earliest relatively complete concert recording is from the 7 December 1963 show at the Liverpool Empire Theatre.Unterberger (2006), p. 76. The Beatles Anthology contained video clips from several concerts, some of which are available in complete form on bootleg video. The following are some of the most notable concerts on bootleg releases. * Washington Coliseum, 1964. The Beatles' first US concert, on 11 February 1964 in Washington, D.C., was captured on black-and-white video for later closed-circuit presentations in cinemas.Unterberger (2006), pp. 306‚Äì309. Some of the video was included in Anthology and in The Beatles: The First US Visit, and most of it was included in the 2003 DVD The Beatles in Washington D.C. from Passport Video. The entire video was released on the grey market DVD Beatles Around the World. All video releases suffer from \\"dark, grainy, and flickery\\" image quality; a report of a 2005 auction of the original master tape gives the possibility of a better quality release in the future. In 2010 the Beatles at last came to iTunes and along with their back catalogue they brought with them a video of this show. The video was made available with the purchase of the iTunes version of The Beatles Stereo Box Set simply called The Beatles Box Set where all albums were released as iTunes LP's featuring on-screen album artwork and the Mini Documentaries from the DVD in the physical release. * Hollywood Bowl, 1964 and 1965. The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl, an official release by EMI in 1977, contained selections from the Beatles' three Hollywood Bowl shows professionally recorded in August 1964 and August 1965. An authorized CD of the remixed 1977 album with 4 bonus tracks was released in September 2016. Bootleg needle drop copies are available, as well as bootleg compilations of the three performances in their entirety. * Palais des Sports, 1965. The Beatles performed two shows on 20 June 1965 at the Palais des Sports in Paris. Both were broadcast over French radio, resulting in bootleg recordings of decent quality; video of the second show also exists.Unterberger (2006), pp. 124‚Äì125. * Shea Stadium, 1965. The Beatles' concert at Shea Stadium on 15 August 1965 was filmed for a television special, The Beatles at Shea Stadium. The programme and its soundtrack have been bootlegged in various formats. One song, \\"Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby\\", was officially released on Anthology 2. A thirty-minute reissue of the footage of the concert was remastered and issued simultaneously with the release of the Ron Howard film The Beatles: Eight Days a Week on 15 September 2016. * Budokan, 1966. The Beatles performed for three days at the Nippon Budokan in Tokyo beginning 30 June 1966, with the first two concerts (30 June 1966 and the afternoon show on 1 July) filmed in colour for Japanese television. The first night's concert video was officially released by Apple in Japan only as Beatles Concert at Budokan 1966. Excerpts from both shows (along with silent colour footage of the first show on 2 July) were included in The Beatles Anthology. * Candlestick Park, 1966. Notable as the Beatles' final paid concert performance, the 29 August 1966 show at Candlestick Park in San Francisco was taped by press officer Tony Barrow on a portable recorder at the request of McCartney; the tape ran out before the last few minutes of the show.Unterberger (2006), pp. 151‚Äì153. =Television performances (1963‚Äì1968)= The Beatles performed on various television programmes; excerpts from many of these were shown in the Anthology documentary, and bootleg video exists of many of the shows in their entirety. The most famous of these were the four appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964 and 1965; after many years circulating on bootlegs, these received official DVD release in 2003 as The Four Complete Historic Ed Sullivan Shows Featuring The Beatles.Unterberger (2006), p. 309. Other notable television performances that have appeared on bootleg video include the Swedish show Drop In from October 1963 (four songs);Unterberger (2006), p. 305. the April 1964 UK special Around The Beatles (six songs mimed to new recordings);Unterberger (2006), pp. 311‚Äì312. the June 1964 Australian special The Beatles Sing for Shell (seven songs survived in complete form, plus fragments of two others);Unterberger (2006), pp. 312‚Äì313. and a September 1968 appearance on Frost on Sunday (new vocals for \\"Hey Jude\\" and \\"Revolution\\" over studio backing tracks, plus brief improvisations), for which multiple takes are available.Unterberger (2006), pp. 326‚Äì327. =Home demos (1963‚Äì1969)= The individual Beatles sometimes recorded basic performances at home of their new compositions, either for copyright purposes (to be sent to Dick James Music publishing affiliate Northern Songs), to later play for the other Beatles, or to give to other artists who would be recording the songs. Many of Lennon's demos that appeared on bootlegs were first heard on the radio series The Lost Lennon Tapes. Some of the Lennon demos available include \\"Bad To Me\\" (1963, given to Billy J. Kramer), \\"I'm in Love\\" (1963, given to The Fourmost [although some scholars date this as a late seventies piano rendition]), \\"If I Fell\\" (1964), and \\"Everyone Had A Hard Year\\" (1968, later incorporated into \\"I've Got a Feeling\\"). There are also Lennon demos available of songs that would develop into \\"She Said She Said\\", \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\", \\"Good Morning Good Morning\\", \\"Across the Universe\\", \\"You Know My Name (Look Up The Number)\\", \\"Don't Let Me Down\\", and two songs he would later record after the Beatles, \\"Oh My Love\\" and \\"Cold Turkey\\". Lennon's home recordings of \\"Bad To Me\\" and \\"I'm in Love\\" were briefly released on iTunes in December 2013 in order to extend the copyright terms of the tracks. McCartney's demos include \\"One and One Is Two\\" (1964, eventually an uncharted single for Mike Shannon and the Strangers), \\"Step Inside Love\\" (1968, given to Cilla Black), \\"Goodbye\\" (1969, given to Mary Hopkin), \\"Come and Get it\\" (1969, given to Badfinger), and early versions of \\"We Can Work It Out\\" (partially taped over by Lennon) and \\"Michelle\\". Harrison's 1963 demo for \\"Don't Bother Me\\" has also been bootlegged. =Christmas recordings (1963‚Äì1969)= Every year from 1963 through to 1969, the Beatles recorded a flexi disc of comedy and music that was sent to members of their fan club. In 1970, these recordings were compiled onto an LP released via their fan club called From Then to You (US title: The Beatles' Christmas Album). Since these singles or compilation album had no official general-public release prior to 2017, all have been frequently bootlegged, some with additional outtakes from Christmas recording sessions, and some supplemented with Christmas themed BBC recordings. A portion of one song recorded for the 1967 Christmas flexi disc, \\"Christmas Time (Is Here Again)\\", was officially released as an additional track on the 1995 \\"Free as a Bird\\" single. Part of the 1963 track is featured as an unlockable special feature on The Beatles: Rock Band. In 2017, Apple released The Christmas Records as a box set of seven 7\\" 45 rpm records pressed on coloured vinyl in replica sleeves. =The White Album (Esher) demos (1968)= In May 1968, the Beatles met at Kinfauns, the Esher home of George Harrison, to review and record demos of songs under consideration for their next album; twenty-seven songs, mostly acoustic, have become public from this session.Unterberger (2006), pp. 195‚Äì200. Seven of these songs were released on Anthology 3, including \\"Junk\\", a song McCartney would later record for his first solo album. Of the twenty demo songs not officially released, fifteen would be recorded and released on the White Album, while \\"Not Guilty\\" and \\"What's the New Mary Jane\\" would be recorded for the album but not make the final line-up. The recordings included on the Anthology series were of a significantly higher fidelity (they came from George's original stereo reels of the demo sessions, and processed at Abbey Road Studios) than the bootlegged recordings (which probably came from John's mono copy of the tapes), raising the possibility that there were higher-quality versions of all twenty-seven songs. In 2018, all twenty-seven original Esher demos were released in high-quality as part of the deluxe 50th Anniversary reissue of The Beatles, taken from Harrison's original 4-track master tapes. Giles Martin described the tapes as: ‚ÄúTo me, it is like the Beatles unplugged. These are demos but they are good: they double- tracked themselves.‚Äù https://www.forbes.com/sites/markbeech/2018/09/24/beatles-history-rewritten- as-white-album-tapes-reveal-secrets/#db020751cb3f Three other songs would never be recorded in the studio by the Beatles: * \\"Child of Nature\\", later released by Lennon, with different lyrics, as \\"Jealous Guy\\" on Imagine. * \\"Circles\\", released by Harrison on his 1982 album Gone Troppo. * \\"Sour Milk Sea\\", a Harrison song later recorded by Jackie Lomax as one of the earliest Apple Record singles. =Get Back / Let It Be sessions (1969)= In January 1969, the Beatles got together with director Michael Lindsay-Hogg to film the rehearsals for the group's proposed first live concert since 1966. This project would concentrate on new material, and was intended to form the basis for both a television documentary and a new album, which were given the title of Get Back.Unterberger (2006), pp. 226‚Äì230. But disagreements and a general lack of enthusiasm within the group led to much of the project never being fully completed. However, a one-off live performance was filmed and recorded on the rooftop of Apple Records on 30 January 1969, and the title song \\"Get Back\\" was released as a single in April 1969. After essentially being abandoned by the Beatles for more than a year, the project was eventually renamed and released in May 1970; with the film footage now becoming a feature film, Let It Be, and the new songs becoming an album of the same name. The rehearsals and recordings took place at Twickenham Film Studios (2‚Äì14 January) and then at Apple (20‚Äì31 January), with more than one hundred hours captured on film and the corresponding Nagra tape recorders used for the film's audio track. These Nagra tapes are the source for most, but not all, of the bootlegs from these sessions. In addition to songs that would later be released by the group, the Beatles played hundreds of cover versions and original compositions. However, many of the performances were brief (some lasting less than ten seconds), and many of the original compositions are undeveloped ideas or improvisations that have been described as the audio equivalent of doodling. A sampling of the rehearsals was officially issued as a bonus disc with Let It Be... Naked. Among the more complete rehearsed songs that have been featured on bootlegs are \\"Watching Rainbows\\", \\"Commonwealth\\", Suzy's Parlour (published under the name Suzy Parker), and \\"The Palace of the King of the Birds\\" (later recorded but not released by McCartney as \\"Castle of the King of the Birds\\"); \\"All Things Must Pass\\", \\"Let It Down\\", \\"Isn't It a Pity\\", and \\"Hear Me Lord'\\", later released by Harrison; \\"Gimme Some Truth\\" and \\"Oh My Love\\", later released by Lennon; and \\"Teddy Boy\\" and \\"Hot as Sun\\", later released by McCartney. Portions of the rooftop concert were seen in the Let It Be film and the Anthology documentary, and three tracks were used for the Let It Be album, while the complete recording has been bootlegged. The performance consisted of \\"Get Back\\" (first and second versions), \\"Don't Let Me Down\\", \\"I've Got a Feeling\\", \\"One After 909\\", \\"Dig a Pony\\", \\"God Save the Queen\\" (a brief version played while the audio tape reel was changed), \\"I've Got a Feeling\\" (second version), \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" (second version), and \\"Get Back\\" (third version). On 30 January 1969, Glyn Johns compiled some performances he had been mixing, and made acetate copies for the Beatles. In addition to songs that would eventually appear on Let It Be, this set included \\"Teddy Boy\\", \\"The Walk\\", by Jimmy McCracklin, and a rock and roll medley that included songs such as \\"I'm Ready\\", an early Fats Domino song, and \\"Shake Rattle and Roll\\", by Big Joe Turner. This was the first version that leaked out and broadcast on multiple radio stations starting in September 1969, and formed the basis for the bootleg Kum Back that appeared near the end of 1969.Winn (2009), p. 261. Johns started working in earnest on compiling an album in March 1969, and a test acetate from this period eventually surfaced on a poor quality bootleg.Unterberger (2006), pp. 282‚Äì285. Johns later made two \\"official\\" attempts at compiling the Get Back album, with both versions widely bootlegged. The 28 May 1969 compilation by Johns contained the following line-up: \\"One After 909\\", \\"Rocker\\", \\"Save the Last Dance for Me\\", \\"Don't Let Me Down\\", \\"Dig a Pony\\", \\"I've Got a Feeling\\", \\"Get Back\\", \\"For You Blue\\", \\"Teddy Boy\\", \\"Two of Us\\", \\"Maggie Mae\\", \\"Dig It\\", \\"Let It Be\\", \\"The Long and Winding Road\\", and \\"Get Back (Reprise)\\". The main changes made for the 5 January 1970 compilation were the removal of \\"Teddy Boy\\" and the additions of \\"I Me Mine\\" and \\"Across the Universe\\". One of the myriad Get Back session compilation bootlegs was The Black Album, a three-LP set from the 1980s in a memorable package (although the material has since been bootlegged in superior sound quality). In the early 2000s, Yellow Dog Records created Day by Day, a 38-part CD series the majority of the Nagra tape recordings, with improved audio quality compared to earlier releases. In January 2003, nearly 500 of the original Nagra tapes were recovered by police in England and the Netherlands, with five people arrested. Even after the raid, bootlegging of the material continued with the Purple Chick label releasing their own digital A/B Road Nagra tape collection. =Post break-up= While there are hundreds of bootlegs based on the solo careers of the members of the band, one is particularly noteworthy as the only known recording of Lennon and McCartney together after the Beatles broke up. A loose jam involving the two, along with Stevie Wonder, Harry Nilsson, Jesse Ed Davis and others, was recorded at Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles on 28 March 1974. The recording did not surface until 18 years later when a portion of it was released on bootleg as A Toot and a Snore in '74. The recording is known more for its historical significance than the quality of the performances. A longer and higher quality version of this session was released by the HMC label in 2016. =Studio album needle drops= Starting in 1987, Apple began officially reissuing the Beatles catalogue on CD. However, as digital remastering was still in its infancy, many fans and audiophiles were disappointed with the sound quality of the official reissues, preferring the ‚Äúwarmth‚Äù of the vinyl releases. Many fans also clamoured for the digital release of the original Beatles Capitol albums as they contained many unique mixes different from the UK releases. Several bootleggers stepped in to fill this void by offering digital copies of their own needle drops of the entire Beatles catalogue, typically using premium vinyl pressings played and digitised with high-end audio equipment. While these unauthorized copies are not bootlegs as commonly defined, their creation and distribution channels overlap with bootleg products. Some of the widely distributed collections are the BEAT/Red Robin, Dr. Ebbetts, and Millennium Remasters series and the Beatles' remasters on \\"DLH Records.\\" The official remastering of the Beatles' catalogue in stereo and mono, released by Apple in September 2009 on both CD and vinyl, has largely made these bootleg remasters obsolete; however collectors in search of authentic original (and in some cases unique) mixes still find them of historical interest. The Beatles' official catalogue of their original stereo studio albums has since been issued via digital download through iTunes. Material not bootlegged A considerable amount of additional never-circulated Beatles material is believed to exist, either in private possession or studio vaults, as mentioned in documents and recollections. From the group's early years, it has been reported that additional songs exist from the 1960 Quarrymen rehearsal tapes, including a Lennon‚ÄìMcCartney instrumental \\"Winston's Walk\\" and early versions of \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\" and \\"Ask Me Why\\". Another recording of considerable interest is a tape of 18 songs from a Beatles show in mid-1962 at the Cavern Club, recorded from the audience. The tape includes several cover versions of songs not available elsewhere by the Beatles, including the Bruce Channel number one \\"Hey! Baby\\", James Ray's \\"If You Gotta Make a Fool of Somebody\\", and the Bobby Vee hit \\"Sharing You\\". McCartney bought the tape at a 1985 auction, and since none of it was used for Anthology, it has been assumed to be of poor sound quality.Unterberger (2006), pp. 43‚Äì44. Many demo recordings are known to have been made by the individual Beatles but have yet to become public. Lennon's uncirculated demos include \\"Do You Want to Know a Secret\\", \\"I Call Your Name\\", \\"No Reply\\" (pre-dating the one on Anthology), \\"In My Life\\", and \\"Good Night\\". McCartney's uncirculated demos include \\"A World Without Love\\", \\"It's for You\\", \\"What Goes On\\", \\"Eleanor Rigby\\", \\"Etcetera\\" (a 1968 song intended for Marianne Faithfull), and \\"The Long and Winding Road\\". However, a small portion of \\"World Without Love\\" made its public debut in January 2013 during a series of Peter Asher concerts and has subsequently appeared in full elsewhere.https://www.beatlesbible.com/2013/01/20/mccartney- demo-world-without-love-unveiled/ Also the Daily Express announced, on 20 July 2016, the original acetate of \\"It's for You\\" demo featuring Paul's voice (it was discovered among other demos in Cilla Black's collection and was proposed for auction).https://www.express.co.uk/celebrity-news/691470/Cilla-Black- family-uncover-Beatles-demo-52-years-after-made These two demos \\"A World Without Love\\" and \\"It's for You\\" were made available on Beatles bootleg The Lost Album in 2017. Between the official Anthology releases and the numerous outtakes that have been bootlegged, many of the Beatles' most interesting studio recordings are available in some form. Nevertheless, there are still recordings known to be in EMI's archives that have generated particular interest in their eventual release. One is \\"Carnival of Light\\", an improvised 14-minute vocal and sound collage that the Beatles created in early 1967 for an art festival; the recording was under consideration for Anthology, and McCartney has been an advocate for its release. Another is take 3 of \\"Helter Skelter\\" from 18 July 1968, renowned for its length of twenty-seven minutes. Anthology 3 included only a 4:38 edit of the 12:35 take 2 from that day's work on the song; asked why a longer version wasn't issued, George Martin explained: \\"I think it gets boring.\\"Unterberger (2006), p. 223. The full 12 minutes of take 2 were eventually released in 2018 for the 50th anniversary of The Beatles. Some recordings may no longer exist, if they ever existed originally. A Quarrymen rehearsal that was recorded at Colin Hanton's home was taped over. BBC documentation shows that \\"Sheila\\" and two versions of \\"Three Cool Cats\\" were recorded and never broadcast, but the tapes were likely reused or discarded, a fate shared by some of the Beatles' studio session tapes prior to late 1963. Carl Perkins said that he joined the Beatles in the studio for a late night jam session on 1 June 1964, but this was probably not taped. Several Lennon‚ÄìMcCartney titles were mentioned in a 1960 letter from McCartney, including \\"Looking Glass\\", \\"Years Roll Along\\", and \\"Keep Looking That Way\\", but there is no evidence that tapes were ever made of those songs during rehearsals from that era. One final source of uncirculated recordings is the set of sessions held in 1994‚Äì1995 for the Anthology project. In addition to the two songs released, two other Lennon demos (which have been bootlegged) became the basis for additional work by the other three Beatles: \\"Now and Then\\" and \\"Grow Old With Me\\". \\"Now and Then\\" was close to being the third new song for Anthology, but it needed more work than the two released songs and was left unfinished; McCartney has indicated an interest in completing the song with Starr. A new song composed by McCartney and Harrison, \\"All for Love\\", was also reportedly recorded by the three ex-Beatles at the sessions but never finished. Fake or disputed bootleg songs A number of songs have been incorrectly claimed by bootleggers to be unreleased Beatles songs. Some originated as spoofs or parodies: \\"Bye Bye Bye\\" (\\"Nice Time\\" by Kenny Everett), \\"Cheese and Onions\\" (The Rutles), \\"Magical Misery Tour\\" (National Lampoon featuring Tony Hendra). Some were by obscure artists whose names were subject to misinterpretation, such as John and Paul (\\"People Say\\" / \\"I'm Walking\\"), John Lennon and the Bleechers (\\"Ram You Hard\\") and Jock Lemmon (\\"Idle Sock\\"). Some were by groups with a (sometimes intentional) Beatlesque style, such as The Fourmost (\\"I Love You Too\\"), The Gants (\\"I Wonder\\"), The End (\\"Shades of Orange\\" / \\"Loving Sacred Loving\\"), The Brittles (\\"Ballyhoo\\"), Lavender Circus (\\"N. Bourbaki's Multicoloured Jam\\"), and Smyle (\\"It's Gonna Be Alright\\"); or with a lead vocalist sounding like one of the Beatles, as on \\"We Are the Moles\\" (Simon Dupree and the Big Sound as The Moles). A few \\"outfakes\\" have been labelled as Beatles tracks many times: * \\"Have You Heard the Word\\". This song was credited to The Fut, and it was rumoured to include some of the Beatles playing with some of the Bee Gees. The actual participants in the 1969 recording were Maurice Gibb, the duo Tin Tin, and Billy Laurie. The recording was so plausible as a Lennon song that Yoko Ono tried to copyright its lyrics as a Lennon composition after his death.Unterberger (2006), p. 359. * \\"The L.S. Bumble Bee\\". Peter Cook and Dudley Moore combined psychedelic music with lyrics spoofing LSD. It was rumoured that Lennon was somehow involved, perhaps as a rebuttal to the controversy about possible drug references in songs like \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\", but Moore has denied this; the song actually predates Sgt. Pepper, having been released in January 1967. * \\"Oh, I Need You\\" (also identified as \\"Oh, I Want You\\"). This song was purported to have been recorded during early sessions for Abbey Road. The artist has not been determined with certainty, but it is often attributed to the band Mortimer, who signed with Apple Records in 1968. *\\"Peace of Mind / The Candle Burns\\". The song was reportedly found in the Apple trash in 1970, but the true origin is still unknown. Some claim it to be an actual Beatles home demo from around 1967, though the lack of any corroborating evidence and the unfamiliar voices on the record have left Beatles experts convinced that it too is a fake. There is a theory that the tape was found at Apple, but was one of the countless demos sent in by aspiring artists looking for a break with the label. *\\"Colliding Circles\\", \\"Left Is Right (And Right Is Wrong)\\", \\"Pink Litmus Paper Shirt\\" and \\"Deck Chair\\". In 1971, humorist Martin Lewis compiled a Beatles bootleg discography for Disc magazine, inserting four song titles he'd simply made up: the John Lennon polemic \\"Left Is Right (And Right Is Wrong),\\" George Harrison's \\"Pink Litmus Paper Shirt,\\" a Paul McCartney vaudeville-style number \\"Deck Chair,\\" and another supposed Lennon track, \\"Colliding Circles\\". These spurious tunes were then picked up by other compilers who have continued to propagate them ever since, despite the complete lack of any evidence for their existence. (Outsider musician R. Stevie Moore has since written and recorded tunes entitled \\"Pink Litmus Paper Shirt\\" and \\"Colliding Circles\\", making them real songs‚Äîjust not real Beatles songs. In addition, The Brittles, a Beatles pastiche band, has recorded \\"Left is Right (and Right is Wrong)\\" and \\"Deck Chair\\"). Musician Neil Innes, Bonzo Dog Band member/Monty Python associate/friend of Martin Lewis, incorporated all four bogus song titles into the song \\"Unfinished Words\\", recorded by The Rutles, and released on their album \\"Archeology\\".

It was issued in an updated form in 1997 and revised again in 2005, claiming to have been signed by 80 scientists and 25 television news meteorologists while the posting of 33 additional signatories was pending verification that those 33 additional scientists still agreed with the statement. All versions of the declaration, which asserts that there is no scientific consensus about the importance of global warming and opposes the recommendations of the Kyoto Protocol, were penned by Fred Singer's Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP). The first declaration was based on a November 9‚Äì10, 1995 conference, organized by Helmut Metzner in Leipzig, Germany. The second declaration was additionally based on a successor conference in Bonn, Germany on November 10‚Äì11, 1997. The conferences were cosponsored by SEPP and the European Academy for Environmental Affairs and titled International Symposium on the Greenhouse Controversy. Today, the declaration is regarded as disinformation campaign, exercised by the climate change denial movement using the fake-expert-strategy, to cast doubt on the scienctific consensus about global warming.John Cook et al: Neutralizing misinformation through inoculation: Exposing misleading argumentation techniques reduces their influence. PLOS ONE 2017, .G. Thomas Farmer, John Cook: Climate Change Science. A modern Synthesis. Volume 1 ‚Äì The Physical Climate. Dordrecht 2013, p. 450.James Lawrence Powell: The Inquisition of Climate Science. New York 2012, p. 11-12.  Versions = The 1995 Declaration = The 1995 declaration asserts: \\"There does not exist today a general scientific consensus about the importance of greenhouse warming from rising levels of carbon dioxide. On the contrary, most scientists now accept the fact that actual observations from earth satellites show no climate warming whatsoever.\\" The latter statement was broadly accurate at the time, but with additional data and correction of errors, all analyses of satellite temperature measurements now show statistically significant warming. The declaration also criticised the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, saying: \\"Energy is essential for all economic growth, and fossil fuels provide today's principal global energy source. In a world in which poverty is the greatest social pollutant, any restriction on energy use that inhibits economic growth should be viewed with caution. For this reason, we consider 'carbon taxes' and other drastic control policies ... to be ill-advised, premature, wrought with economic danger, and likely to be counterproductive.\\"  Signatures  According to the SEPP website, there were 79 signatures to the 1995 declaration, including Frederick Seitz: the current SEPP chair. Perhaps the most prominent signatory to the declaration was Dr. Robert E. Stevenson, a former research scientist for NASA and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The signature list was last updated on July 16, 1996. Of these 79, 33 failed to respond when SEPP asked them to sign the 1997 declaration. SEPP calls the signatories \\"nearly 100 climate experts\\". The signatures to the 1995 declaration were disputed by David Olinger of the St. Petersburg Times. In an article on July 29, 1996, he revealed that many signers, including Chauncey Starr, Robert Balling, and Patrick Michaels, have received funding from the oil industry, while others had no scientific training or could not be identified. (paywall) The 1995 declarations begins: \\"As scientists, we are intensely interested in the possibility that human activities may affect the global climate\\". However, those identified as scientists and climate experts include at least ten weather presenters, including Dick Groeber of Dick's Weather Service in Springfield, Ohio. Groeber, who had not completed a university degree, labelled himself a scientist by virtue of his thirty to forty years of self-study. In any case, it is difficult to accurately evaluate the list of signatures of the 1995 declaration, as the SEPP website provides no additional details about them except for their university, if they are professors. = The 1997 Declaration = The 1997 declaration updated the 1995 declaration in a number of ways. The most obvious difference was its focus on the Kyoto Protocol, as the Kyoto conference was in the process of being finalised. The declaration says: : \\"We believe the Kyoto Protocol -- to curtail carbon dioxide emissions from only part of the world community -- is dangerously simplistic, quite ineffective, and economically destructive to jobs and standards-of-living. ... We consider the drastic emission control policies deriving from the Kyoto conference -- lacking credible support from the underlying science -- to be ill-advised and premature.\\" The 1997 declaration also updated its citations of evidence that appeared to run contrary to the consensus on global warming. For example, the 1995 declaration cites \\"observations from earth satellites,\\" where the 1997 declaration cites \\"observations from both weather satellites and balloon-borne radiosondes.\\" As with satellite data, subsequent analysis of radiosondes has shown a statistically significant warming trend.  Signatures  The declaration begins: \\"As independent scientists concerned with atmospheric and climate problems, we...\\". As with the 1995 declaration, questions have been raised about the scientific background of the signers, and others have questioned the degree to which they can be deemed to be independent. Because many of those who signed the 1997 declaration also signed the 1995 declaration, the concerns raised by David Olinger and others after the 1995 declaration are still relevant. The signers are generally described by Fred Singer and his supporters as climate scientists, although the current signers also include 25 weather presenters. One key report opposing the scientific credentials of the signers was a Danish Broadcasting Company TV special by √òjvind Hesselager. Hesselager attempted to contact the declaration's 33 European signers and found that four of them could not be located, twelve denied ever having signed, and some had not even heard of the Leipzig Declaration. Those who verified signing included a medical doctor, a nuclear scientist, and an entomologist. After discounting the signers whose credentials were inflated, irrelevant, false, or unverifiable, Hesselager claimed that only 20 of the names on the list had any scientific connection with the study of climate change, and some of those names were known to have obtained grants from the oil and fuel industry, including the German coal industry and the government of Kuwait (a major oil exporter). As a result of Hesselager's report, Singer removed some, but not all, of the discredited signatures. The number of signatures on the document, according to SEPP's own press releases, has declined from 140 (according to a December 1997 press release) to 105 (). SEPP's position is that \\"a few of the original signers did not have the 'proper' academic credentials - even though they understand the scientific climate issues quite well. To avoid this kind of smear, we want to restrict the Leipzig Declaration to signers with impeccable qualifications.\\" To address the signer credibility issue, SEPP has provided considerably more information about each signer on their website and lists the weather presenters separately from the other signers. = 2005, revised = As of 2010, Singer's SEPP website listed the \\"2005, revised\\" declaration (which still spoke of the 1997 Kyoto conference as a future event). This version included the claim: \\"In fact, many climate specialists now agree that actual observations from weather satellites show no global warming whatsoever\\".  Use of the declarations  UAH; green: RSS) records of temperature variations since 1979. Trends plotted since January 1982. (Source: Publicly available data, figure by Robert A.

It has been cited by Fred Singer in editorial columns appearing in hundreds of websites and major publications, including The Wall Street Journal, Miami Herald, Detroit News, Chicago Tribune, The Plain Dealer, Memphis Commercial Appeal, The Seattle Times, and The Orange County Register. Jeff Jacoby, a columnist with the Boston Globe, described the signers of the Leipzig Declaration as \\"climate scientists\\" that \\"include prominent scholars.\\" Think tanks such as The Heritage Foundation, The Heartland Institute, and Australia's Institute for Public Affairs called them \\"noted scientists.\\" Both the Leipzig Declaration and Frederick Seitz's Oregon Petition have been quoted as authoritative sources during deliberations in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. Although the key data on which the Leipzig declaration relied (such as satellite temperature measurements) has been invalidated by subsequent research, and much new evidence has accumulated, the declaration continues to be cited, along with the Oregon Petition, as evidence of the current views of scientists on climate change. Moreover, the organizers have not changed their stated position of rejecting global warming with human activity as primary driver.

According to this theory, when two actions or ideas are not psychologically consistent with each other, people do all in their power to change them until they become consistent. The discomfort is triggered by the person's belief clashing with new information perceived, wherein they try to find a way to resolve the contradiction to reduce their discomfort.Festinger, L. (1957). A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance. California: Stanford University Press. In A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance (1957), Leon Festinger proposed that human beings strive for internal psychological consistency to function mentally in the real world. A person who experiences internal inconsistency tends to become psychologically uncomfortable and is motivated to reduce the cognitive dissonance. They tend to make changes to justify the stressful behavior, either by adding new parts to the cognition causing the psychological dissonance (rationalization) or by avoiding circumstances and contradictory information likely to increase the magnitude of the cognitive dissonance (confirmation bias). Coping with the nuances of contradictory ideas or experiences is mentally stressful. It requires energy and effort to sit with those seemingly opposite things that all seem true. Festinger argued that some people would inevitably resolve dissonance by blindly believing whatever they wanted to believe.  Relations among cognitions  To function in the reality of modern society, human beings continually adjust the correspondence of their mental attitudes and personal actions; such continual adjustments, between cognition and action, result in one of three relationships with reality: # Consonant relationship: Two cognitions or actions consistent with each other (e.g. not wanting to become drunk when out to dinner, and ordering water rather than wine) # Irrelevant relationship: Two cognitions or actions unrelated to each other (e.g. not wanting to become drunk when out and wearing a shirt) # Dissonant relationship: Two cognitions or actions inconsistent with each other (e.g. not wanting to become drunk when out, but then drinking more wine) = Magnitude of dissonance = The term \\"magnitude of dissonance\\" refers to the level of discomfort caused to the person. This can be caused by the relationship between two differing internal beliefs, or an action that is incompatible with the beliefs of the person. Two factors determine the degree of psychological dissonance caused by two conflicting cognitions or by two conflicting actions: # The importance of cognitions: the greater the personal value of the elements, the greater the magnitude of the dissonance in the relation. When the value of the importance of the two dissonant items is high, it is difficult to determine which action or thought is correct. Both have had a place of truth, at least subjectively, in the mind of the person. Therefore, when the ideals or actions now clash, it is difficult for the individual to decide which takes priority. # Ratio of cognitions: the proportion of dissonant-to-consonant elements. There is a level of discomfort within each person that is acceptable for living. When a person is within that comfort level, the dissonant factors do not interfere with functioning. However, when dissonant factors are abundant and not enough in line with each other, one goes through a process to regulate and bring the ratio back to an acceptable level. Once a subject chooses to keep one of the dissonant factors, they quickly forget the other to restore peace of mind. There is always some degree of dissonance within a person as they go about making decisions, due to the changing quantity and quality of knowledge and wisdom that they gain. The magnitude itself is a subjective measurement since the reports are self relayed, and there is no objective way as yet to get a clear measurement of the level of discomfort.  Reduction Cognitive dissonance theory proposes that people seek psychological consistency between their expectations of life and the existential reality of the world. To function by that expectation of existential consistency, people continually reduce their cognitive dissonance in order to align their cognitions (perceptions of the world) with their actions. The creation and establishment of psychological consistency allows the person afflicted with cognitive dissonance to lessen mental stress by actions that reduce the magnitude of the dissonance, realized either by changing with or by justifying against or by being indifferent to the existential contradiction that is inducing the mental stress. In practice, people reduce the magnitude of their cognitive dissonance in four ways: # Change the behavior or the cognition (\\"I'll eat no more of this doughnut.\\") # Justify the behavior or the cognition, by changing the conflicting cognition (\\"I'm allowed to cheat my diet every once in a while.\\") # Justify the behavior or the cognition by adding new behaviors or cognitions (\\"I'll spend thirty extra minutes at the gymnasium to work off the doughnut.\\") # Ignore or deny information that conflicts with existing beliefs (\\"This doughnut is not a high-sugar food.\\") Three cognitive biases are components of dissonance theory. The bias that one does not have any biases, the bias that one is \\"better, kinder, smarter, more moral and nicer than average\\" and confirmation bias. That a consistent psychology is required for functioning in the real world also was indicated in the results of The Psychology of Prejudice (2006), wherein people facilitate their functioning in the real world by employing human categories (i.e. sex and gender, age and race, etc.) with which they manage their social interactions with other people. The study Patterns of Cognitive Dissonance-reducing Beliefs Among Smokers: A Longitudinal Analysis from the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Four Country Survey (2012) indicated that smokers use justification beliefs to reduce their cognitive dissonance about smoking tobacco and the negative consequences of smoking it. # Continuing smokers (Smoking and no attempt to quit since the previous round of study.) # Successful quitters (Quit during the study and did not use tobacco from the time of the previous round of study.) #Failed quitters (Quit during the study, but relapsed to smoking at the time of the study.) To reduce cognitive dissonance, the participant smokers adjusted their beliefs to correspond with their actions: # Functional beliefs (\\"Smoking calms me down when I am stressed or upset.\\"; \\"Smoking helps me concentrate better.\\"; \\"Smoking is an important part of my life.\\" and \\"Smoking makes it easier for me to socialize.\\") # Risk-minimizing beliefs (\\"The medical evidence that smoking is harmful is exaggerated.\\"; \\"One has to die of something, so why not enjoy yourself and smoke?\\" and \\"Smoking is no more risky than many other things people do.\\") = Selective Exposure = Another method to reduce cognitive dissonance is through Selective Exposure Theory. This theory has been discussed since the early days of Festinger's discovery of cognitive dissonance. He noticed that people would selectively expose themselves to some media over others; specifically, they would avoid dissonant messages and prefer consonant messaged. Through selective exposure, people actively (and selectively) choose what to watch, view, or read that fit to their current state of mind, mood or beliefs. In other words, consumers select attitude- consistent information and avoid attitude-challenging information. This can be applied to media, news, music, and any other messaging channel. The idea is, choosing something that is in opposition to how you feel or believe in will render cognitive dissonance. For example, a study was done in an elderly home in 1992 on the loneliest residents -- those that did not have family or frequent visitors. The residents were shown a series of documentaries: three that featured a \\"very happy, successful elderly person\\", and three that featured an \\"unhappy, lonely elderly person.\\" After watching the documentaries, the residents indicated they preferred the media featuring the unhappy, lonely person over the happy person. This can be attested to them feeling lonely, and experience cognitive dissonance watching somebody their age feeling happy and being successful. This study explains how people select media that aligns with their mood, as in selectively exposing themselves to people and experiences they are already experiencing. It is more comfortable to see a movie about a character that is similar to you than to watch one about someone who is your age who is more successful than you. Another example to note is how people mostly consume media that aligns with their political views. In a study done in 2015, participants were shown ‚Äúattitudinally consistent, challenging, or politically balanced online news.‚Äù Results showed that the participants trusted attitude-consistent news the most out of all the others, regardless of the source. It is evident that the participants actively selected media that aligns with their beliefs rather than opposing media. In fact, recent research has suggested that while a discrepancy between cognitions drives individuals to crave for attitude-consistent information, the experience of negative emotions drives individuals to avoid counterattitudinal information. In other words, it is the psychological discomfort which activates selective exposure as a dissonance-reduction strategy. Paradigms There are four theoretic paradigms of cognitive dissonance, the mental stress people suffer when exposed to information that is inconsistent with their beliefs, ideals or values: Belief Disconfirmation, Induced Compliance, Free Choice, and Effort Justification, which respectively explain what happens after a person acts inconsistently, relative to his or her intellectual perspectives; what happens after a person makes decisions and what are the effects upon a person who has expended much effort to achieve a goal. Common to each paradigm of cognitive-dissonance theory is the tenet: People invested in a given perspective shall‚Äîwhen confronted with contrary evidence‚Äîexpend great effort to justify retaining the challenged perspective. =Belief disconfirmation= The contradiction of a belief, ideal, or system of values causes cognitive dissonance that can be resolved by changing the challenged belief, yet, instead of effecting change, the resultant mental stress restores psychological consonance to the person by misperception, rejection, or refutation of the contradiction, seeking moral support from people who share the contradicted beliefs or acting to persuade other people that the contradiction is unreal.Harmon-Jones, Eddie, \\"A Cognitive Dissonance Theory Perspective on Persuasion\\", in The Persuasion Handbook: Developments in Theory and Practice, James Price Dillard, Michael Pfau, Eds. 2002. Thousand Oaks, California: Sage Publications, p.101.Kracht, C., & Woodard, D., Five Years (Hanover: Wehrhahn Verlag, 2011), p. 123. The early hypothesis of belief contradiction presented in When Prophecy Fails (1956) reported that faith deepened among the members of an apocalyptic religious cult, despite the failed prophecy of an alien spacecraft soon to land on Earth to rescue them from earthly corruption. At the determined place and time, the cult assembled; they believed that only they would survive planetary destruction; yet the spaceship did not arrive to Earth. The confounded prophecy caused them acute cognitive-dissonance: Had they been victims of a hoax? Had they vainly donated away their material possessions? To resolve the dissonance between apocalyptic, end-of-the-world religious beliefs and earthly, material reality, most of the cult restored their psychological consonance by choosing to believe a less mentally-stressful idea to explain the missed landing: that the aliens had given planet Earth a second chance at existence, which, in turn, empowered them to re-direct their religious cult to environmentalism and social advocacy to end human damage to planet Earth. On overcoming the confounded belief by changing to global environmentalism, the cult increased in numbers by proselytism.Festinger, L., Riecken, H.W., Schachter, S. When Prophecy Fails (1956). Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press. p. 000. The study of The Rebbe, the Messiah, and the Scandal of Orthodox Indifference (2008) reported the belief contradiction occurred to the Chabad Orthodox Jewish congregation who believed that their Rebbe (Menachem Mendel Schneerson) was the Messiah. When he died of a stroke in 1994, instead of accepting that their Rebbe was not the Messiah, some of the congregation proved indifferent to that contradictory fact and continued claiming that Schneerson was the Messiah and that he would soon return from the dead.Berger, David (2008). The Rebbe, the Messiah, and the Scandal of Orthodox Indifference. Portland: Litman Library of Jewish Civilization. =Induced compliance= lying) a person might find external, consonant elements. Therefore, a snake oil salesman might find a psychological self-justification (great profit) for promoting medical falsehoods, but, otherwise, might need to change his beliefs about the falsehoods. In the Cognitive Consequences of Forced Compliance (1959), the investigators Leon Festinger and Merrill Carlsmith asked students to spend an hour doing tedious tasks; e.g. turning pegs a quarter-turn, at fixed intervals. The tasks were designed to induce a strong, negative, mental attitude in the subjects. Once the subjects had done the tasks, the experimenters asked one group of subjects to speak with another subject (an actor) and persuade that impostor-subject that the tedious tasks were interesting and engaging. Subjects of one group were paid twenty dollars ($20); those in a second group were paid one dollar ($1) and those in the control group were not asked to speak with the imposter-subject. At the conclusion of the study, when asked to rate the tedious tasks, the subjects of the second group (paid $1) rated the tasks more positively than did either the subjects in the first group (paid $20) or the subjects of the control group; the responses of the paid subjects were evidence of cognitive dissonance. The researchers, Festinger and Carlsmith, proposed that the subjects experienced dissonance between the conflicting cognitions. \\"I told someone that the task was interesting\\" and \\"I actually found it boring.\\" The subjects paid one dollar were induced to comply, compelled to internalize the \\"interesting task\\" mental attitude because they had no other justification. The subjects paid twenty dollars were induced to comply by way of an obvious, external justification for internalizing the \\"interesting task\\" mental attitude and experienced a lesser degree of cognitive dissonance. Forbidden Behaviour paradigm In the Effect of the Severity of Threat on the Devaluation of Forbidden Behavior (1963), a variant of the induced-compliance paradigm, by Elliot Aronson and Carlsmith, examined self-justification in children. Children were left in a room with toys, including a greatly desirable steam shovel, the forbidden toy. Upon leaving the room, the experimenter told one- half of the group of children that there would be severe punishment if they played with the steam-shovel toy and told the second half of the group that there would be a mild punishment for playing with the forbidden toy. All of the children refrained from playing with the forbidden toy (the steam shovel). Later, when the children were told that they could freely play with any toy they wanted, the children in the mild-punishment group were less likely to play with the steam shovel (the forbidden toy), despite the removal of the threat of mild punishment. The children threatened with mild punishment had to justify, to themselves, why they did not play with the forbidden toy. The degree of punishment was insufficiently strong to resolve their cognitive dissonance; the children had to convince themselves that playing with the forbidden toy was not worth the effort. In The Efficacy of Musical Emotions Provoked by Mozart's Music for the Reconciliation of Cognitive Dissonance (2012), a variant of the forbidden-toy paradigm, indicated that listening to music reduces the development of cognitive dissonance. Without music in the background, the control group of four-year-old children were told to avoid playing with a forbidden toy. After playing alone, the control-group children later devalued the importance of the forbidden toy. In the variable group, classical music played in the background while the children played alone. In the second group, the children did not later devalue the forbidden toy. The researchers, Nobuo Masataka and Leonid Perlovsky, concluded that music might inhibit cognitions that induce cognitive dissonance. Music is a stimulus that can diminish post-decisional dissonance; in an earlier experiment, Washing Away Postdecisional Dissonance (2010), the researchers indicated that the actions of hand-washing might inhibit the cognitions that induce cognitive dissonance. = Free choice= In the study Post-decision Changes in Desirability of Alternatives (1956) 225 female students rated domestic appliances and then were asked to choose one of two appliances as a gift. The results of a second round of ratings indicated that the women students increased their ratings of the domestic appliance they had selected as a gift and decreased their ratings of the appliances they rejected. This type of cognitive dissonance occurs in a person faced with a difficult decision, when there always exist aspects of the rejected-object that appeal to the chooser. The action of deciding provokes the psychological dissonance consequent to choosing X instead of Y, despite little difference between X and Y; the decision \\"I chose X\\" is dissonant with the cognition that \\"There are some aspects of Y that I like\\". The study Choice-induced Preferences in the Absence of Choice: Evidence from a Blind Two-choice Paradigm with Young Children and Capuchin Monkeys (2010) reports similar results in the occurrence of cognitive dissonance in human beings and in animals. Peer Effects in Pro-Social Behavior: Social Norms or Social Preferences? (2013) indicated that with internal deliberation, the structuring of decisions among people can influence how a person acts, and that social preferences and social norms are related and function with wage-giving among three persons. The actions of the first person influenced the wage-giving actions of the second person. That inequity aversion is the paramount concern of the participants. =Effort justification= Cognitive dissonance occurs to a person who voluntarily engages in (physically or ethically) unpleasant activities to achieve a goal. The mental stress caused by the dissonance can be reduced by the person exaggerating the desirability of the goal. In The Effect of Severity of Initiation on Liking for a Group (1956), to qualify for admission to a discussion group, two groups of people underwent an embarrassing initiation of varied psychological severity. The first group of subjects were to read aloud twelve sexual words considered obscene; the second group of subjects were to read aloud twelve sexual words not considered obscene. Both groups were given headphones to unknowingly listen to a recorded discussion about animal sexual behaviour, which the researchers designed to be dull and banal. As the subjects of the experiment, the groups of people were told that the animal- sexuality discussion actually was occurring in the next room. The subjects whose strong initiation required reading aloud obscene words evaluated the people of their group as more-interesting persons than the people of the group who underwent the mild initiation to the discussion group. In Washing Away Your Sins: Threatened Morality and Physical Cleansing (2006), the results indicated that a person washing his or her hands is an action that helps resolve post-decisional cognitive dissonance because the mental stress usually was caused by the person's ethical‚Äìmoral self-disgust, which is an emotion related to the physical disgust caused by a dirty environment. The study The Neural Basis of Rationalization: Cognitive Dissonance Reduction During Decision-making (2011) indicated that participants rated 80 names and 80 paintings based on how much they liked the names and paintings. To give meaning to the decisions, the participants were asked to select names that they might give to their children. For rating the paintings, the participants were asked to base their ratings on whether or not they would display such art at home. The results indicated that when the decision is meaningful to the person deciding value, the likely rating is based on his or her attitudes (positive, neutral or negative) towards the name and towards the painting in question. The participants also were asked to rate some of the objects twice and believed that, at session's end, they would receive two of the paintings they had positively rated. The results indicated a great increase in the positive attitude of the participant towards the liked pair of things, whilst also increasing the negative attitude towards the disliked pair of things. The double-ratings of pairs of things, towards which the rating participant had a neutral attitude, showed no changes during the rating period. The existing attitudes of the participant were reinforced during the rating period and the participants suffered cognitive dissonance when confronted by a liked-name paired with a disliked-painting.  Examples  In the fable of ‚ÄúThe Fox and the Grapes‚Äù, by Aesop, on failing to reach the desired bunch of grapes, the fox then decides he does not truly want the fruit because it is sour. The fox's act of rationalization (justification) reduced his anxiety over the cognitive dissonance from the desire he cannot realise. =Meat-eating= Meat-eating can involve discrepancies between the behavior of eating meat and various ideals that the person holds. Some researchers call this form of moral conflict the meat paradox. Hank Rothgerber posited that meat eaters may encounter a conflict between their eating behavior and their affections toward animals. This occurs when the dissonant state involves recognition of one's behavior as a meat eater and a belief, attitude, or value that this behavior contradicts. The person with this state may attempt to employ various methods, including avoidance, willful ignorance, dissociation, perceived behavioral change, and do-gooder derogation to prevent this form of dissonance from occurring. Once occurred, he or she may reduce it in the form of motivated cognitions, such as denigrating animals, offering pro-meat justifications, or denying responsibility for eating meat. The extent of cognitive dissonance with regards to meat eating can vary depending on the attitudes and values of the individual involved because these can effect whether or not they see any moral conflict with their values and what they eat. For example, individuals who are more dominance minded and who value having a masculine identity are less likely to experience cognitive dissonance because they are less likely to believe eating meat is morally wrong. = Unpleasant medical screenings = In a study titled Cognitive Dissonance and Attitudes Toward Unpleasant Medical Screenings (2016), researchers Michael R. Ent and Mary A. Gerend informed the study participants about a discomforting test for a specific (fictitious) virus called the \\"human respiratory virus-27\\". The study used a fake virus to prevent participants from having thoughts, opinions, and feeling about the virus that would interfere with the experiment. The study participants were in two groups; one group was told that they were actual candidates for the virus-27 test, and the second group were told they were not candidates for the test. The researchers reported, \\"We predicted that [study] participants who thought that they were candidates for the unpleasant test would experience dissonance associated with knowing that the test was both unpleasant and in their best interest‚Äîthis dissonance was predicted to result in unfavorable attitudes toward the test.\\" = Related phenomena = Cognitive dissonance may also occur when people seek to: * Explain inexplicable feelings: When an earthquake disaster occurs to a community, irrational rumors, based upon fear, quickly reach the adjoining communities unaffected by the disaster because those people, not in physical danger, psychologically justify their anxieties about the earthquake. * Minimize regret of irrevocable choices: At a hippodrome, bettors have more confidence after betting on horses they chose just before the post-time because this confidence prevents a change of heart; the bettors felt post-decision cognitive dissonance. *Explain their motivations for taking some action that had an extrinsic incentive attached (known as motivational \\"crowding out\\"). * Justify behavior that opposed their views: After being induced to cheat in an academic examination, students judged cheating less harshly. * Align one's perceptions of a person with one's behavior toward that person: The Ben Franklin effect refers to that statesman's observation that the act of performing a favor for a rival leads to increased positive feelings toward that individual. * Reaffirm held beliefs: The confirmation bias identifies how people readily read information that confirms their established opinions and readily avoid reading information that contradicts their opinions. The confirmation bias is apparent when a person confronts deeply held political beliefs, i.e. when a person is greatly committed to his or her beliefs, values, and ideas.  Applications= Education = The management of cognitive dissonance readily influences the apparent motivation of a student to pursue education. The study Turning Play into Work: Effects of Adult Surveillance and Extrinsic Rewards on Children‚Äôs Intrinsic Motivation (1975) indicated that the application of the effort justification paradigm increased student enthusiasm for education with the offer of an external reward for studying; students in pre-school who completed puzzles based upon an adult promise of reward were later less interested in the puzzles than were students who completed the puzzle-tasks without the promise of a reward. The incorporation of cognitive dissonance into models of basic learning-processes to foster the students‚Äô self-awareness of psychological conflicts among their personal beliefs, ideals, and values and the reality of contradictory facts and information, requires the students to defend their personal beliefs. Afterwards, the students are trained to objectively perceive new facts and information to resolve the psychological stress of the conflict between reality and the student's value system. Moreover, educational software that applies the derived principles facilitates the students‚Äô ability to successfully handle the questions posed in a complex subject. Meta-analysis of studies indicates that psychological interventions that provoke cognitive dissonance in order to achieve a directed conceptual change do increase students‚Äô learning in reading skills and about science. = Psychotherapy = The general effectiveness of psychotherapy and psychological intervention is partly explained by the theory of cognitive dissonance.Cooper, J. (2007). Cognitive Dissonance: 50 Years of a Classic Theory. London: Sage Publications. In that vein, social psychology proposed that the mental health of the patient is positively influenced by his and her action in freely choosing a specific therapy and in exerting the required, therapeutic effort to overcome cognitive dissonance.Cooper, J., & Axsom, D. (1982). Integration of Clinical and Social Psychology. Oxford University Press. That effective phenomenon was indicated in the results of the study Effects of Choice on Behavioral Treatment of Overweight Children (1983), wherein the children's belief that they freely chose the type of therapy received, resulted in each overweight child losing a greater amount of excessive body weight. In the study Reducing Fears and Increasing Attentiveness: The Role of Dissonance Reduction (1980), people afflicted with ophidiophobia (fear of snakes) who invested much effort in activities of little therapeutic value for them (experimentally represented as legitimate and relevant) showed improved alleviation of the symptoms of their phobia. Likewise, the results of Cognitive Dissonance and Psychotherapy: The Role of Effort Justification in Inducing Weight Loss (1985) indicated that the patient felt better in justifying his or her efforts and therapeutic choices towards effectively losing weight. That the therapy of effort expenditure can predict long-term change in the patient's perceptions. =Social behavior = Cognitive dissonance is used to promote positive social behaviours, such as increased condom use; other studies indicate that cognitive dissonance can be used to encourage people to act pro-socially, such as campaigns against public littering, campaigns against racial prejudice, and compliance with anti- speeding campaigns. The theory can also be used to explain reasons for donating to charity. Cognitive dissonance can be applied in social areas such as racism and racial hatred. Acharya of Stanford, Blackwell and Sen of Harvard state CD increases when an individual commits an act of violence toward someone from a different ethnic or racial group and decreases when the individual does not commit any such act of violence. Research from Acharya, Blackwell and Sen shows that individuals committing violence against members of another group develop hostile attitudes towards their victims as a way of minimizing CD. Importantly, the hostile attitudes may persist even after the violence itself declines (Acharya, Blackwell, Sen 2015). The application provides a social psychological basis for the constructivist viewpoint that ethnic and racial divisions can be socially or individually constructed, possibly from acts of violence (Fearon and Laitin, 2000). Their framework speaks to this possibility by showing how violent actions by individuals can affect individual attitudes, either ethnic or racial animosity (Acharya, Blackwell, Sen 2015). = Consumer behavior = Three main conditions exist for provoking cognitive dissonance when buying: (i) The decision to purchase must be important, such as the sum of money to spend; (ii) The psychological cost; and (iii) The purchase is personally relevant to the consumer. The consumer is free to select from the alternatives and the decision to buy is irreversible. The study Beyond Reference Pricing: Understanding Consumers' Encounters with Unexpected Prices (2003), indicated that when consumers experience an unexpected price encounter, they adopt three methods to reduce cognitive dissonance: (i) Employ a strategy of continual information; (ii) Employ a change in attitude; and (iii) Engage in minimisation. Consumers employ the strategy of continual information by engaging in bias and searching for information that supports prior beliefs. Consumers might search for information about other retailers and substitute products consistent with their beliefs. Alternatively, consumers might change attitude, such as re- evaluating price in relation to external reference-prices or associating high prices and low prices with quality. Minimisation reduces the importance of the elements of the dissonance; consumers tend to minimise the importance of money, and thus of shopping around, saving, and finding a better deal. = Politics = Cognitive dissonance theory might suggest that since votes are an expression of preference or beliefs, even the act of voting might cause someone to defend the actions of the candidate for whom they voted, and if the decision was close then the effects of cognitive dissonance should be greater. This effect was studied over the 6 presidential elections of the United States between 1972 and 1996, and it was found that the opinion differential between the candidates changed more before and after the election than the opinion differential of non-voters. In addition, elections where the voter had a favorable attitude toward both candidates, making the choice more difficult, had the opinion differential of the candidates change more dramatically than those who only had a favorable opinion of one candidate. What wasn't studied were the cognitive dissonance effects in cases where the person had unfavorable attitudes toward both candidates. The 2016 U.S. election held historically high unfavorable ratings for both candidates. = Communication = Cognitive dissonance theory of communication was initially advanced by American psychologist Leon Festinger in the 1960s. Festinger theorized that cognitive dissonance usually arises when a person holds two or more incompatible beliefs simultaneously. This is a normal occurrence since people encounter different situations that invoke conflicting thought sequences. This conflict results in a psychological discomfort. According to Festinger, people experiencing a thought conflict try to reduce the psychological discomfort by attempting to achieve an emotional equilibrium. This equilibrium is achieved in three main ways. First, the person may downplay the importance of the dissonant thought. Second, the person may attempt to outweigh the dissonant thought with consonant thoughts. Lastly, the person may incorporate the dissonant thought into their current belief system. Dissonance plays an important role in persuasion. To persuade people, you must cause them to experience dissonance, and then offer your proposal as a way to resolve the discomfort. Although there is no guarantee your audience will change their minds, the theory maintains that without dissonance, there can be no persuasion. Without a feeling of discomfort, people are not motivated to change. Similarly, it is the feeling of discomfort which motivates people to perform selective exposure (i.e., avoiding disconfirming information) as a dissonance-reduction strategy. = Artificial Intelligence = It is hypothesized that introducing cognitive dissonance into machine learning may be able to assist in the long-term aim of developing 'creative autonomy' on the part of agents, including in multi-agent systems (such as games), and ultimately to the development of 'strong' forms of artificial intelligence, including artificial general intelligence.  Alternative paradigms  Dissonant self-perception: A lawyer can experience cognitive dissonance if he must defend as innocent a client he thinks is guilty. From the perspective of The Theory of Cognitive Dissonance: A Current Perspective (1969), the lawyer might experience cognitive dissonance if his false statement about his guilty client contradicts his identity as a lawyer and an honest man. = Self- perception theory= In Self-perception: An alternative interpretation of cognitive dissonance phenomena (1967), the social psychologist Daryl Bem proposed the self-perception theory whereby people do not think much about their attitudes, even when engaged in a conflict with another person. The Theory of Self-perception proposes that people develop attitudes by observing their own behaviour, and concludes that their attitudes caused the behaviour observed by self-perception; especially true when internal cues either are ambiguous or weak. Therefore, the person is in the same position as an observer who must rely upon external cues to infer his or her inner state of mind. Self-perception theory proposes that people adopt attitudes without access to their states of mood and cognition. As such, the experimental subjects of the Festinger and Carlsmith study (Cognitive Consequences of Forced Compliance, 1959) inferred their mental attitudes from their own behaviour. When the subject-participants were asked: \\"Did you find the task interesting?\\", the participants decided that they must have found the task interesting, because that is what they told the questioner. Their replies suggested that the participants who were paid twenty dollars had an external incentive to adopt that positive attitude, and likely perceived the twenty dollars as the reason for saying the task was interesting, rather than saying the task actually was interesting. The theory of self-perception (Bem) and the theory of cognitive dissonance (Festinger) make identical predictions, but only the theory of cognitive dissonance predicts the presence of unpleasant arousal, of psychological distress, which were verified in laboratory experiments. In The Theory of Cognitive Dissonance: A Current Perspective (Aronson, Berkowitz, 1969), Elliot Aronson linked cognitive dissonance to the self-concept: That mental stress arises when the conflicts among cognitions threatens the person's positive self-image. This reinterpretation of the original Festinger and Carlsmith study, using the induced-compliance paradigm, proposed that the dissonance was between the cognitions \\"I am an honest person.\\" and \\"I lied about finding the task interesting.\\" The study Cognitive Dissonance: Private Ratiocination or Public Spectacle? (Tedeschi, Schlenker, ect. 1971) reported that maintaining cognitive consistency, rather than protecting a private self-concept, is how a person protects his or her public self-image. Moreover, the results reported in the study I‚Äôm No Longer Torn After Choice: How Explicit Choices Implicitly Shape Preferences of Odors (2010) contradict such an explanation, by showing the occurrence of revaluation of material items, after the person chose and decided, even after having forgotten the choice. = Balance theory= Fritz Heider proposed a motivational theory of attitudinal change that derives from the idea that humans are driven to establish and maintain psychological balance. The driving force for this balance is known as the consistency motive, which is an urge to maintain one's values and beliefs consistent over time. Heider's conception of psychological balance has been used in theoretical models measuring cognitive dissonance.The Marketing of Global Warming: A Repeated Measures Examination of the Effects of Cognitive Dissonance, Endorsement, and Information on Beliefs in a Social Cause. Proquest Digital Dissertations: https://pqdtopen.proquest.com/doc/1906281562.html?FMT=ABS According to balance theory, there are three interacting elements: (1) the self (P), (2) another person (O), and (3) an element (X). These are each positioned at one vertex of a triangle and share two relations: :Unit relations ‚Äì things and people that belong together based on similarity, proximity, fate, etc. :Sentiment relations ‚Äì evaluations of people and things (liking, disliking) Under balance theory, human beings seek a balanced state of relations among the three positions. This can take the form of three positives or two negatives and one positive: :P = you :O = your child :X = picture your child drew ::\\"I love my child\\" ::\\"She drew me this picture\\" ::\\"I love this picture\\" People also avoid unbalanced states of relations, such as three negatives or two positives and one negative: :P = you :O = John :X = John's dog ::\\"I don't like John\\" ::\\"John has a dog\\" ::\\"I don't like the dog either\\" =Cost‚Äìbenefit analysis= In the study On the Measurement of the Utility of Public Works (1969), Jules Dupuit reported that behaviors and cognitions can be understood from an economic perspective, wherein people engage in the systematic processing of comparing the costs and benefits of a decision. The psychological process of cost-benefit comparisons helps the person to assess and justify the feasibility (spending money) of an economic decision, and is the basis for determining if the benefit outweighs the cost, and to what extent. Moreover, although the method of cost-benefit analysis functions in economic circumstances, men and women remain psychologically inefficient at comparing the costs against the benefits of their economic decision.Dupuit, J. (1969). ‚ÄúOn the Measurement of the Utility of Public Works‚Äù, Readings in Welfare =Self-discrepancy theory= E. Tory Higgins proposed that people have three selves, to which they compare themselves: # Actual self ‚Äì representation of the attributes the person believes him- or herself to possess (basic self-concept) # Ideal self ‚Äì ideal attributes the person would like to possess (hopes, aspiration, motivations to change) # Ought self ‚Äì ideal attributes the person believes he or she should possess (duties, obligations, responsibilities) When these self-guides are contradictory psychological distress (cognitive dissonance) results. People are motivated to reduce self-discrepancy (the gap between two self-guides). =Averse consequences vs. inconsistency= During the 1980s, Cooper and Fazio argued that dissonance was caused by aversive consequences, rather than inconsistency. According to this interpretation, the belief that lying is wrong and hurtful, not the inconsistency between cognitions, is what makes people feel bad. Subsequent research, however, found that people experience dissonance even when they feel they have not done anything wrong. For example, Harmon-Jones and colleagues showed that people experience dissonance even when the consequences of their statements are beneficial‚Äîas when they convince sexually active students to use condoms, when they, themselves are not using condoms. =Criticism of the free-choice paradigm= In the study How Choice Affects and Reflects Preferences: Revisiting the Free-choice Paradigm (Chen, Risen, 2010) the researchers criticized the free-choice paradigm as invalid, because the rank-choice-rank method is inaccurate for the study of cognitive dissonance. That the designing of research-models relies upon the assumption that, if the experimental subject rates options differently in the second survey, then the attitudes of the subject towards the options have changed. That there are other reasons why an experimental subject might achieve different rankings in the second survey; perhaps the subjects were indifferent between choices. Although the results of some follow-up studies (e.g. Do Choices Affect Preferences? Some Doubts and New Evidence, 2013) presented evidence of the unreliability of the rank-choice-rank method, the results of studies such as Neural Correlates of Cognitive Dissonance and Choice-induced Preference Change (2010) have not found the Choice-Rank-Choice method to be invalid, and indicate that making a choice can change the preferences of a person. =Action‚Äìmotivation model= Festinger's original theory did not seek to explain how dissonance works. Why is inconsistency so aversive? The action‚Äìmotivation model seeks to answer this question. It proposes that inconsistencies in a person's cognition cause mental stress, because psychological inconsistency interferes with the person's functioning in the real world. Among the ways for coping, the person can choose to exercise a behavior that is inconsistent with his or her current attitude (a belief, an ideal, a value system), but later try to alter that belief to be consonant with a current behavior; the cognitive dissonance occurs when the person's cognition does not match the action taken. If the person changes the current attitude, after the dissonance occurs, he or she then is obligated to commit to that course of behavior. Cognitive dissonance produces a state of negative affect, which motivates the person to reconsider the causative behavior in order to resolve the psychological inconsistency that caused the mental stress.Jones and Gerard, 1967McGregor et al., 1999Newby-Clark et al., 2002 As the afflicted person works towards a behavioral commitment, the motivational process then is activated in the left frontal cortex of the brain.Jones, E. E., Gerard, H. B., 1967. Foundations of Social Psychology. New York: Wiley.McGregor, I., Newby-Clark, I. R., Zanna, M. P., 1999. ‚ÄúEpistemic Discomfort is Moderated by Simultaneous Accessibility of Inconsistent Elements‚Äù, in Cognitive Dissonance: Progress on a Pivotal Theory in Social Psychology, Washington, DC: American Psychological Association, pp. 325‚Äì53. =Predictive dissonance model= The predictive dissonance model proposes that cognitive dissonance is fundamentally related to the predictive coding (or predictive processing) model of cognition. A predictive processing account of the mind proposes that perception actively involves the use of a Bayesian hierarchy of acquired prior knowledge, which primarily serves the role of predicting incoming proprioceptive, interoceptive and exteroceptive sensory inputs. Therefore, the brain is an inference machine that attempts to actively predict and explain its sensations. Crucial to this inference is the minimization of prediction error. The predictive dissonance account proposes that the motivation for cognitive dissonance reduction is related to an organism's active drive for reducing prediction error. Moreover, it proposes that human (and perhaps other animal) brains have evolved to selectively ignore contradictory information (as proposed by dissonance theory) to prevent the overfitting of their predictive cognitive models to local and thus non- generalizing conditions. The predictive dissonance account is highly compatible with the action-motivation model since, in practice, prediction error can arise from unsuccessful behavior.  Neuroscience findings  Technological advances are allowing psychologists to study the biomechanics of cognitive dissonance. = Visualization = The study Neural Activity Predicts Attitude Change in Cognitive Dissonance (Van Veen, Krug, ect, 2009) identified the neural bases of cognitive dissonance with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); the neural scans of the participants replicated the basic findings of the induced-compliance paradigm. When in the fMRI scanner, some of the study participants argued that the uncomfortable, mechanical environment of the MRI machine nevertheless was a pleasant experience for them; some participants, from an experimental group, said they enjoyed the mechanical environment of the fMRI scanner more than did the control-group participants (paid actors) who argued about the uncomfortable experimental environment. The results of the neural scan experiment support the original theory of Cognitive Dissonance proposed by Festinger in 1957; and also support the psychological conflict theory, whereby the anterior cingulate functions, in counter- attitudinal response, to activate the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the anterior insular cortex; the degree of activation of said regions of the brain is predicted by the degree of change in the psychological attitude of the person. The biomechanics of cognitive dissonance: MRI evidence indicates that the greater the psychological conflict signalled by the anterior cingulate cortex, the greater the magnitude of the cognitive dissonance experienced by the person. As an application of the free-choice paradigm, the study How Choice Reveals and Shapes Expected Hedonic Outcome (2009) indicates that after making a choice, neural activity in the striatum changes to reflect the person's new evaluation of the choice-object; neural activity increased if the object was chosen, neural activity decreased if the object was rejected. Moreover, studies such as The Neural Basis of Rationalization: Cognitive Dissonance Reduction During Decision-making (2010) and How Choice Modifies Preference: Neural Correlates of Choice Justification (2011) confirm the neural bases of the psychology of cognitive dissonance. The Neural Basis of Rationalization: Cognitive Dissonance Reduction During Decision-making (Jarcho, Berkman, Lieberman, 2010) applied the free-choice paradigm to fMRI examination of the brain's decision-making process whilst the study participant actively tried to reduce cognitive dissonance. The results indicated that the active reduction of psychological dissonance increased neural activity in the right-inferior frontal gyrus, in the medial fronto- parietal region, and in the ventral striatum, and that neural activity decreased in the anterior insula. That the neural activities of rationalization occur in seconds, without conscious deliberation on the part of the person; and that the brain engages in emotional responses whilst effecting decisions. = Emotional correlations = The results reported in Contributions from Research on Anger and Cognitive Dissonance to Understanding the Motivational Functions of Asymmetrical Frontal Brain Activity (Harmon- Jones, 2004) indicate that the occurrence of cognitive dissonance is associated with neural activity in the left frontal cortex, a brain structure also associated with the emotion of anger; moreover, functionally, anger motivates neural activity in the left frontal cortex.Harmon-Jones, 1999 and 2002. Applying a directional model of Approach motivation, the study Anger and the Behavioural Approach System (2003) indicated that the relation between cognitive dissonance and anger is supported by neural activity in the left frontal cortex that occurs when a person takes control of the social situation causing the cognitive dissonance. Conversely, if the person cannot control or cannot change the psychologically stressful situation, he or she is without a motivation to change the circumstance, then there arise other, negative emotions to manage the cognitive dissonance, such as socially inappropriate behavior. The anterior cingulate cortex activity increases when errors occur and are being monitored as well as having behavioral conflicts with the self- concept as a form of higher-level thinking. A study was done to test the prediction that the left frontal cortex would have increased activity. University students had to write a paper depending on if they were assigned to a high-choice or low-choice condition. The low-choice condition required students to write about supporting a 10% increase in tuition at their university. The point of this condition was to see how significant the counterchoice may affect a person's ability to cope. The high-choice condition asked students to write in favor of tuition increase as if it were their completely voluntary choice. The researchers use EEG to analyze students before they wrote the essay, as dissonance is at its highest during this time (Beauvois and Joule, 1996). High-choice condition participants showed a higher level of the left frontal cortex than the low-choice participants. Results show that the initial experience of dissonance can be apparent in the anterior cingulate cortex, then the left frontal cortex is activated, which also activates the approach motivational system to reduce anger.Beauvois, J. L., Joule, R. V., 1996. A radical dissonance theory. London: Taylor and Francis. = The psychology of mental stress = The results reported in The Origins of Cognitive Dissonance: Evidence from Children and Monkeys (Egan, Santos, Bloom, 2007) indicated that there might be evolutionary force behind the reduction of cognitive dissonance in the actions of pre-school-age children and Capuchin monkeys when offered a choice between two like options, decals and candies. The groups then were offered a new choice, between the choice-object not chosen and a novel choice-object that was as attractive as the first object. The resulting choices of the human and simian subjects concorded with the theory of cognitive dissonance when the children and the monkeys each chose the novel choice-object instead of the choice-object not chosen in the first selection, despite every object having the same value. The hypothesis of An Action-based Model of Cognitive-dissonance Processes (Harmon-Jones, Levy, 2015) proposed that psychological dissonance occurs consequent to the stimulation of thoughts that interfere with a goal-driven behavior. Researchers mapped the neural activity of the participant when performing tasks that provoked psychological stress when engaged in contradictory behaviors. A participant read aloud the printed name of a color. To test for the occurrence of cognitive dissonance, the name of the color was printed in a color different than the word read aloud by the participant. As a result, the participants experienced increased neural activity in the anterior cingulate cortex when the experimental exercises provoked psychological dissonance. The study Cognitive Neuroscience of Social Emotions and Implications for Psychopathology: Examining Embarrassment, Guilt, Envy, and Schadenfreude (Jankowski, Takahashi, 2014) identified neural correlations to specific social emotions (e.g. envy and embarrassment) as a measure of cognitive dissonance. The neural activity for the emotion of Envy (the feeling of displeasure at the good fortune of another person) was found to draw neural activity from the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. That such increased activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex occurred either when a person's self-concept was threatened or when the person suffered embarrassment (social pain) caused by salient, upward social-comparison, by social-class snobbery. That social emotions, such as embarrassment, guilt, envy, and Schadenfreude (joy at the misfortune of another person) are correlated to reduced activity in the insular lobe, and with increased activity in the striate nucleus; those neural activities are associated with a reduced sense of empathy (social responsibility) and an increased propensity towards antisocial behavior (delinquency). Modeling in neural networks Artificial neural network models of cognition provide methods for integrating the results of empirical research about cognitive dissonance and attitudes into a single model that explains the formation of psychological attitudes and the mechanisms to change such attitudes. Among the artificial neural-network models that predict how cognitive dissonance might influence a person's attitudes and behavior, are: * Parallel constraint satisfaction processes * The meta-cognitive model (MCM) of attitudes * Adaptive connectionist model of cognitive dissonance * Attitudes as constraint satisfaction model = Contradictions to the theory = Because cognitive dissonance is a relatively new theory, there are some that are skeptical of the idea. Charles G. Lord wrote a paper on whether or not the theory of cognitive dissonance was not tested enough and if it was a mistake to accept it into theory. He claimed that the theorist did not take into account all the factors and came to a conclusion without looking at all the angles. However, even with this contradiction, cognitive dissonance is still accepted as the most likely theory that we have to date.  See also  References  Further reading   Fearon, J. D., & Latin, D. D.

It was a Bantustan‚Äîan area set aside for black South Africans of Xhosa descent‚Äîand operated as a nominally independent parliamentary democracy. Its capital was Umtata (renamed Mthatha in 2004). Transkei represented a significant precedent and historic turning point in South Africa's policy of apartheid and \\"separate development\\"; it was the first of four territories to be declared independent of South Africa. Throughout its existence, it remained an internationally unrecognised, diplomatically isolated, politically unstable de facto one-party state, which at one point broke relations with South Africa, the only country that acknowledged it as a legal entity. In 1994, it was reintegrated into its larger neighbour and became part of the Eastern Cape province. History=Establishment= The South African government set up the area as one of the two homelands for Xhosa-speaking people in Cape Province, the other being Ciskei; it was given nominal autonomy in 1963. Although the first election was contested and won by the Democratic Party, whose founder Chief Victor Poto was opposed to the notion of Bantustan independence, the government was formed by the Transkei National Independence Party. Of the 109 members in the regional parliament, 45 were elected and 64 were held by ex officio chiefs. The entity became a nominally independent state in 1976 with its capital at Umtata (now Mthatha), although it was recognised only by South Africa and later by the other nominally independent republics within the TBVC-system. Chief Kaiser Daliwonga Matanzima was Transkei's Prime Minister until 1979, when he assumed the office of President, a position he held until 1986. International reaction South African prime minister B. J. Vorster justified the declaration of Transkei as an independent republic by referring to \\"the right of every people to have full control over its own affairs\\" and wished \\"Transkei and its leaders God's richest blessings on the road ahead.\\" A press release by the African National Congress at the time rejected the Transkei's independence and condemned it as \\"designed to consolidate the inhuman policies of apartheid\\". During its thirty-first session, in resolution A/RES/31/6 A, the General Assembly of the United Nations referred to Transkei's \\"sham independence\\" as \\"invalid,\\" re-iterated its labeling of South Africa as a \\"racist r√©gime,\\" and called upon \\"all [g]overnments to deny any form of recognition to the so-called independent Transkei.\\" An article published in Time Magazine opined that though Transkei declared independence theoretically as a \\"free Black state\\", Matanzima ruled as the dictator of a one-party state. He banned local opposition parties and bought farmlands for himself and his family offered by the South African government at subsidised prices. Matanzima published Independence my Way in 1976, a book in which he argued that true liberation could only be gained through a confederation of black states; he described Transkei as a positive precedent and maintained that the liberation struggle chosen by the ANC would not be successful. The United Nations Security Council supported moves not to recognise Transkei, and in Resolution 402 (1976) condemned moves by South Africa to pressure Lesotho to recognise Transkei by closing its borders with the country. =Troubled existence= Throughout its existence, Transkei's economy remained dependent on that of its larger neighbour, with the local population being recruited as workers into South Africa's Rand mines. Because of a territorial dispute, Matanzima announced on 10 April 1978 that Transkei would break all diplomatic ties with South Africa, including a unilateral withdrawal from the non-aggression pact between the two governments, and ordered that all South African Defence Force members seconded to the Transkei Army should leave. This created the unique situation of a country refusing to deal with the only internationally recognised nation it was recognised by. Matanzima soon backed down in the face of Transkei's dependence on South African economic aid. During his reign, Matanzima arrested state officials and journalists at will; in late 1979, he detained the head of the newly formed Democratic Progressive Party, Sabata Dalindyebo, king of the Thembu people and vocal opponent of apartheid, for violating the dignity and injuring the reputation of the president. Dalindyebo went into exile in Zambia, a move that marked the end of official opposition politics in Transkei, and in the 1981 election, the ruling Transkei National Independence Party was re-elected, gaining 100% of all open seats. On 20 February 1986, faced with South African evidence of corruption, Matanzima was forced to retire as President. He was succeeded by his brother George. Kaiser Matanzima was still described as Transkei's effective leader for a time, but soon the two fell out and Kaiser was temporarily detained in the Transkei gaols in 1987; upon release, he was restricted to Qamata. In 1987, Transkei, a larger, wealthier and more populous entity, which had long sought the annexation of Ciskei, and had undertaken a series of military raids on Ciskei attempted to seize control of Ciskei, in an attack on leader Lennox Sebe's compound, with the apparent goal of taking him hostage, in order to force a merger of the two Bantustans. The South African government intervened to warn the Transkei government off. General Bantu Holomisa of the Transkei Defence Force forced the resignation and exile of Prime Minister George Matanzima in October 1987 and then overthrew Matanzima's successor, Prime Minister Stella Sigcau in December 1987. Holomisa became the Head of State, and the Transkei was from that point onwards effectively in (often uneasy) alliance with the African National Congress and provided a relatively safe area for the ANC's activities. In 1990, Holomisa himself evaded a failed attempt to be ousted from his post, and when asked about the fate of his opponents, he claimed that they had died in the ensuing battles with TDF soldiers. It was later found that those deemed responsible for the foiled coup had only suffered minor injuries, but were subsequently executed without trial. =Dissolution= The Transkei government was a participant in the Codesa negotiations for a new South Africa. The territory was reincorporated into South Africa on 27 April 1994, and the area became part of the Eastern Cape province. Government and politics Nominally, the Republic of Transkei was a parliamentary democracy which allowed for a multi-party system. During its existence, six different parties registered to compete in elections at different points of its history. Until the military coup of 1987, the TNIP remained the ruling party, while the Transkei People's Freedom Party constituted the official opposition. Because its founder, Cromwell Diko, was a former member of the ruling party, and due to its continued support of President Matanzima's policies, there is a widely held belief that it was actually initiated by Matanzima himself to give the impression of free elections when in fact there were none. Other parties that existed never did gain any representation in parliament. According to the Constitution of Transkei, parliament consisted of the president in joint session with the National Assembly and its laws and legislative decisions were immune to judicial review. Seventy-five of its members were elected by popular vote from the various districts Transkei's territory was divided into. The remaining members were unelected Paramount Chiefs and ex officio chiefs whose number per district was enshrined in the constitution. =Citizenship= With the establishment of the republic, the citizenry consisted of all those who had been holding the citizenship of the former territory of Transkei. Individuals were given no choice in this matter as the Transkeian constitution was a legally binding act; for the future, it provided citizenship regulations based on both jus sanguinis and jus soli. Citizenship by descent was given along the paternal line, regardless of a person's place of birth; in addition, any individual born within the republic's territory was eligible for citizenship, excluding those whose father held diplomatic immunity or was deemed an illegal immigrant and whose mother was a non-citizen. Dual citizenship at birth was not permitted, and renunciation of one's citizenship was legally possible, but rendered the individual stateless in most cases. In effect, the regulations thus created an almost homogeneous population of Xhosa ethnicity, though exceptions existed. =Flag= The flag of Transkei is a triband. The colours are (from the top down) ochre red, white, and green. Geography and demographics Topographic map of the Transkei The Transkei consisted of three disconnected sections with a total area covering ,. The large main segment was bordered by the Umtamvuna River in the north and the Great Kei River in the south, with the Indian Ocean and the Drakensberg mountain range, including parts of the landlocked kingdom of Lesotho, served as the eastern and western frontiers. A further two small segments occurred as landlocked isolates within South Africa. One of these was in the north-west, along the Orange River adjoining south-western Lesotho, and the other in the uMzimkhulu area to the east, each reflecting colonially designated tribal areas where Xhosa speaking peoples predominated. A large portion of the area was mountainous and not suitable for agriculture. The territorial dispute with South Africa that led to the break in relations was a patch of territory called East Griqualand (which was situated between the main and eastern segments of Transkei with its northern limit at the Lesotho border). South Africa put East Griqualand under the jurisdiction of the Cape Province instead of Transkei, thus making it an exclave of the Cape Province. The majority of the population was Xhosa-speaking, and according to the Constitution of the Republic of Transkei, Xhosa was the sole official language, but laws had to be translated into Sotho and English in order for them to come into effect, and Afrikaans was permissible in court proceedings and for other administrative purposes. In addition, many thousands of northern Transkei residents spoke a small hybrid Nguni‚ÄìSotho language, called Phuthi. Conflicting data exist about the number of inhabitants. According to the South African Encyclopaedia, the total population of the Transkei increased from 2,487,000 to 3,005,000 between 1960 and 1970. An estimate of 1982 puts the number at about 2.3 million, with approximately 400,000 citizens residing permanently outside the territory's borders. Fewer than 10,000 individuals were of European descent, and the urbanisation-rate for the entire population was around 5%. Security forces The Transkei Defence Force (TDF) was formed in October 1976 and numbered about 2,000, including one infantry battalion and an air wing with two light transporters and two helicopters. By 1993, the number of troops had risen to 4,000. Initial training was provided by the SADF, and despite its diplomatic isolation, the government of Transkei received advice from and collaborated with Israeli counterinsurgency experts. Armscor/Krygkor was its main supplier of weaponry. After breaking all diplomatic ties with South Africa, President Matanzima announced construction-plans for an international airport by an unnamed French consortium in order for \\"arms and troops from other countries\\" to be brought into Transkei without touching South African soil, but did not elaborate on where those resources would originate. During its last days in 1994, the Transkei Police had 4,993 police officers, operating from 61 police stations throughout the territory. With the dissolution of Transkei in 1994, the TDF and the Transkei Police were incorporated into the South African National Defence Force and the South African Police Service, respectively.

Described as an \\"instantly recognizable sad-faced actor\\", Schiavelli was diagnosed with Marfan syndrome in childhood.Tom Jacobs (08 September 1991). [ACTOR SCHIAVELLI DECLARES VICTORY OVER MARFAN'S]. The Chicago Tribune, accessed 27 November 2019 Schiavelli gained fame as a character actor, mainly in supporting roles. His best-known roles include Fredrickson in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975), Mr. Vargas in Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982), the Subway Ghost in Ghost (1990), Organ Grinder in Batman Returns (1992), Chester in The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996), Dr. Kaufman in Tomorrow Never Dies (1997) and ABC executive Maynard Smith in Man on the Moon (1999). Before his death in 2005, Schiavelli was considered by many as one of Hollywood's best character actors. Roger Ebert stated Schiavelli \\"had a way of slipping into films without people knowing his name, but they remembered his great performances as unique characters.\\" Early life Schiavelli was born in Brooklyn to a Sicilian-American family, the son of John Schiavelli and Katherine Coco. He attended Bishop Loughlin Memorial High School in Brooklyn. He studied acting through the theatre program at New York University and began performing on stage in the 1960s. Career Schiavelli's first film role occurred in Milo≈° Forman's 1971 production Taking Off, in which he played a counselor who taught parents of runaway teens to smoke marijuana in order to better understand their children's experiences. Schiavelli's aptitude and distinctive appearance soon provided him with a steady stream of supporting roles, often in Forman's films, including One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Amadeus, The People vs. Larry Flynt, Valmont, and the 1999 biopic Man on the Moon. He played Mr. Vargas, the biology teacher, in the 1982 comedy Fast Times at Ridgemont High, a role he reprised in the 1986 television spin-off Fast Times. He was cast in a similar role in Better Off Dead in which he played Mr. Kerber, a geometry teacher. In 1987, he starred alongside Tim Conway in the short film comedy Dorf on Golf, and then Dorf and the First Games of Mount Olympus in 1988. In 1990, he played the Subway Ghost in Ghost and in 1992, he played in Tim Burton's Batman Returns as the \\"Organ Grinder\\", one of the Penguin's henchmen. He appeared as another villain in the James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies (1997), as a silent monk in The Frisco Kid (1979), and as John O'Connor, one of the evil Red Lectroids in 1984's The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension. In 1994 he appeared in the music video for ZZ Top's \\"Breakaway\\", alongside Fairuza Balk and in 1997, was named one of America's best character actors by Vanity Fair magazine. He also made several voice appearances in the animated television show Hey Arnold!. In 2002, he played a children's television show host turned heroin addict named Buggy Ding Dong in Death to Smoochy.\\"Character Actor Vincent Schiavelli Dies\\", NPR's Morning Edition, 2005-12-27 His first television role came in 1972 as Peter Panama in The Corner Bar, the first sustained portrayal of a gay character on American television. His other television credits include The Moneychangers, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, WKRP in Cincinnati and Taxi as the priest who marries Latka and Simka. He appeared in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \\"The Arsenal of Freedom\\" as a holographic salesman, on Miami Vice as a research scientist who conspires to steal a top-secret prototype weapon from his employer, and in an uncredited role in an episode of Punky Brewster. In 1987 he appeared as Lyle, a gangster, in the MacGyver season 2 episode \\"Soft Touch\\". In Highlander: The Series, he played Leo Atkins, a homeless Vietnam War veteran accused of murder in the Season 1 episode \\"Innocent Man\\". In The X-Files, he played Lanny, man with an underdeveloped conjoined twin in the Season 2 episode \\"Humbug\\". He wrote a number of cookbooks and food articles for various magazines and newspapers, notably Gourmet, Saveur, and the Los Angeles Times. In 1999, Schiavelli starred in a 26-episode Italian cooking show called Chefs of Cucina Amore that aired on PBS periodically for the next couple of years. He received a James Beard Foundation Journalism Award in 2001 and was nominated on several other occasions. Schiavelli's three cookbooks are memoirs, with recipes related to personal history and anecdotes: *Papa Andrea's Sicilian Table: Recipes from a Sicilian Chef As Remembered by His Grandson, 1993 *Bruculinu, America: Remembrances of Sicilian-American Brooklyn, Told in Stories and Recipes, 1998 *Many Beautiful Things: Stories and Recipes from Polizzi Generosa, 2002 Vincent Schiavelli's tombstone in Polizzi Generosa graveyard Schiavelli served as honorary co-chair of the National Marfan Foundation, an organization which serves those affected by Marfan syndrome, from which Schiavelli suffered.\\"NMF Mourns the Loss of its Honorary Co-Chair, Vincent Schiavelli\\" , National Marfan Foundation. Retrieved April 10, 2011 Schiavelli also performed in a few video games, including Emperor: Battle for Dune (as Harkonnen Mentat Yanich Kobal) and as Dr. Hellman in the video game Corpse Killer. Personal life Schiavelli was married to actress Allyce Beasley from 1985 until their 1988 divorce. He guest-starred as the love interest of Beasley's character on one episode of Moonlighting. Their son, Andrea Schiavelli, was born in 1987. In 1992, Schiavelli married American harpist Carol Mukhalian. Death Schiavelli died of lung cancer on December 26, 2005, aged 57, at his home in Polizzi Generosa, the Sicilian town where his grandfather, Andrea Coco, was born, and about which he wrote in his 2002 book Many Beautiful Things: Stories and Recipes from Polizzi Generosa (). Schiavelli was buried at Polizzi Generosa Cemetery, near Palermo, Sicily. Two documentaries were made about Schiavelli's Sicilian life. The first, Once Upon a Time in Polizzi, was released on October 11, 2005 (two months before his death), and the second, Many Beautiful Things (Tanti Beddi Cosi is the Sicilian title), was produced by Aurelio Gambadoro and released in 2014. The film Hey Arnold!: The Jungle Movie is dedicated to his memory. (Schiavelli provided a guest voice appearance as the Pigeon Man in the original series.)

Maru≈°iƒç obtained his BSc in technical mathematics from the University of Ljubljana in 1976, and his PhD from the University of Reading in 1981 under the supervision of Crispin Nash-Williams. Maru≈°iƒç has published extensively, and has supervised seven PhD students (as of 2013). He served as the third rector of the University of Primorska from 2011-2019, a university he lobbied to have established in his home town of Koper. His research focuses on topics in algebraic graph theory, particularly the symmetry of graphs and the action of finite groups on combinatorial objects. He is regarded as the founder of the Slovenian school of research in algebraic graph theory and permutation groups. Education and career From 1968 to 1972 Maru≈°iƒç attended gymnasium in Koper. He studied undergraduate mathematics at the University of Ljubljana, graduating in 1976. He completed his PhD in 1981 in England, at the University of Reading under the supervision of Crispin Nash-Williams. After completing a post-doctoral fellowship at the University of Reading in 1983, Maru≈°iƒç spent a year teaching high school mathematics in Koper. He worked for one year at the University of Minnesota Duluth as an assistant professor, and then spent three years at the University of California, Santa Cruz, from 1985-1988. In 1988, he returned to Slovenia to work at the University of Ljubljana, where he rose quickly through the ranks, becoming a full professor in 1994. He also held the post of vice-rector of student affairs there from 1989-1991. In 1991-92 he spent a year as a Fulbright scholar at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Maru≈°iƒç maintains his post at the University of Ljubljana, although he has also held an appointment at the University of Primorska since 2004, shortly after its founding. He has increasingly devoted his time to the newer university, where he established the Faculty of Mathematics, Natural Sciences, and Information Technologies (UP FAMNIT). He served as the dean of that faculty from 2007-2011. He was elected in 2011 as the third rector of the University of Primorska, a position which he held until 2019. Maru≈°iƒç has supervised seven PhD students, and has supervised or co-supervised six post- doctoral fellows, in addition to numerous master's and honours students. He is one of the two founding editors and editors-in-chief (with Toma≈æ Pisanski) of the journal Ars Mathematica Contemporanea. Achievements and honours Maru≈°iƒç is regarded as the founder of the Slovenian school of research in algebraic graph theory and permutation groups. In 2002 he received the Zois Award, the highest scientific award in Slovenia, for his achievements in the field of graph theory and algebra. Since 2010, he has been a member of the committee that selects the Zois Award recipients, as well as the recipients of other scientific honours from the government of Slovenia. Research In his research, Maru≈°iƒç has focused on the actions of permutation groups on graphs. Some of his major contributions have been on the topics of the existence of semiregular automorphisms (see group action for an explanation of this) of vertex-transitive graphs, the existence of Hamiltonian paths and cycles in vertex-transitive graphs, and the structures of semi-symmetric graphs and half-transitive graphs. With co-authors, he proved that the Gray graph on 54 vertices is the smallest cubic semi-symmetric graph. He has well over 100 publications. Personal life Maru≈°iƒç is married and has two sons.

Its name means unicorn in Greek. Its definition is attributed to the 17th-century Dutch cartographer Petrus Plancius. It is bordered by Orion to the west, Gemini to the north, Canis Major to the south, and by Hydra to the east. Other bordering constellations include Canis Minor, Lepus, and Puppis.  Features  The constellation Monoceros as it can be seen by the naked eye. =Stars= Monoceros contains only a few fourth magnitude stars, making it difficult to see with the naked eye. Alpha Monocerotis has a visual magnitude of 3.93, while for Gamma Monocerotis it is 3.98. Beta Monocerotis is a triple star system; the three stars forms a fixed triangle. The visual magnitudes of the stars are 4.7, 5.2, and 6.1. William Herschel discovered it in 1781 and called it \\"one of the most beautiful sights in the heavens.\\" Epsilon Monocerotis is a fixed binary, with visual magnitudes of 4.5 and 6.5. S Monocerotis, or 15 Monocerotis, is a bluish white variable star and is located at the center of NGC 2264. The variation in its magnitude is slight (4.2‚Äì4.6). It has a companion star of visual magnitude 8. V838 Monocerotis, a variable red supergiant star, had an outburst starting on January 6, 2002; in February of that year, its brightness increased by a factor of 10,000 in one day. After the outburst was over, the Hubble Space Telescope was able to observe a light echo, which illuminated the dust surrounding the star. Monoceros also contains Plaskett's Star, a massive binary system whose combined mass is estimated to be that of almost 100 solar masses. One of the nearest known black holes to our Solar System is in this constellation. The binary star system A0620-00 in the constellation of Monoceros is at a distance of about roughly 3,300 light- years (1,000 parsecs) away. The black hole is estimated to be 6.6 solar masses. =Planets= Monoceros contains two super-Earth exoplanets in one planetary system: COROT-7b was detected by the COROT satellite and COROT-7c was detected by HARPS from ground-based telescopes. Until the announcement of Kepler-10b in January 2011, COROT-7b was the smallest exoplanet to have its diameter measured, at 1.58 times that of the Earth (which would give it a volume 3.95 times Earth's). Both planets in this system were discovered in 2009. =Deep-sky objects= Monoceros contains many clusters and nebulae, most notable among them: * M50, an open cluster * The Rosette Nebula (NGC 2237, 2238, 2239, and 2246) is a diffuse nebula in Monoceros. It has an overall magnitude of 6.0 and is 4900 light-years from Earth. The Rosette Nebula, over 100 light-years in diameter, has an associated star cluster and possesses many Bok globules in its dark areas. It was independently discovered in the 1880s by Lewis Swift (early 1880s) and Edward Emerson Barnard (1883) as they hunted for comets. * The Christmas Tree Cluster (NGC 2264) is another open cluster in Monoceros. Named for its resemblance to a Christmas tree, it is fairly bright at an overall magnitude of 3.9; it is 2400 light-years from Earth. The variable star S Monocerotis represents the tree's trunk, while the variable star V429 Monocerotis represents its top. * The Cone Nebula (NGC 2264), associated with the Christmas Tree Cluster, is a very dim nebula that contains a dark conic structure. It appears clearly in photographs, but is very elusive in a telescope. The nebula contains several Herbig‚ÄìHaro objects, which are small irregularly variable nebulae. They are associated with protostars. * NGC 2254 is an open cluster with an overall magnitude of 9.7, 7100 light-years from Earth. It is a Shapley class f and Trumpler class I 2 p cluster, meaning that it appears to be a fairly rich cluster overall, though it has fewer than 50 stars. It appears distinct from the background star field and is very concentrated at its center; its stars range moderately in brightness. * Hubble's Variable Nebula (NGC 2261) is a nebula with an approximate magnitude of 10, 2500 light-years from Earth. Though it is named for Edwin Hubble, it was discovered in 1783 by William Herschel. Hubble's Variable Nebula is illuminated by R Monocerotis, a young variable star embedded in the nebula; the star's unique interaction with the material in the nebula makes it both an emission nebula and a reflection nebula. One hypothesis regarding their interaction is that the nebula and its illuminating star are a very early stage planetary system. *IC 447, a reflection nebula.  History  The constellation Monoceros, from Urania's Mirror, a set of star charts from 1825. Includes Canis Minor and the obsolete constellation Printer's Workshop In Western astronomy, Monoceros is a relatively modern constellation, not one of Ptolemy's 48 in the Almagest. Its first certain appearance was on a globe created by the Dutch cartographer Petrus Plancius in 1612 or 1613Le costellazioni di Petrus Plancius on atlascoelestis.com and it was later charted by German astronomer Jakob Bartsch as Unicornu on his star chart of 1624. German astronomers Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers and Ludwig Ideler indicate (according to Richard Hinkley Allen's allegations) that the constellation may be older, quoting an astrological work from 1564 that mentioned \\"the second horse between the Twins and the Crab has many stars, but not very bright\\"; these references may ultimately be due to the 13th century Scotsman Michael Scot, but refer to a horse and not a unicorn, and its position does not quite match. Joseph Scaliger is reported to have found Monoceros on an ancient Persian sphere. French astronomer Camille Flammarion believed that a former constellation, Neper (the \\"Auger\\"), occupied the area of the sky now home to Monoceros and Microscopium, but this is disputed.Allen, p. 290. Chinese asterisms Sze F≈´h, the Four Great Canals; Kwan Kew; and Wae Choo, the Outer Kitchen, all lay within the boundaries of Monoceros.

Formerly simply a descriptive term, commercial blends started to be sold under this name in the 1970s. These blends often contain savory, marjoram, rosemary, thyme, and oregano. Lavender leaves are also included in products in the North American market. The herb mixture is typically used with grilled foods and stews. History Proven√ßal cuisine has traditionally used many herbs which were often characterized collectively as herbes de Provence, but not in specific combinations, and not sold as a mixture. It was in the 1970s that homogenised mixtures were formulated by spice wholesalers, including notably Ducros in France (now part of McCormick & Company). Herbs used These mixtures typically contain savory, marjoram, rosemary, thyme, oregano, and other herbs. In the North American market, lavender leaves are also typically included (perhaps due to American association of Provence with its fields of lavender), though lavender does not appear in the recipes in Jean-Baptiste Reboul's 1910 compendium of Proven√ßal cooking. Sale As the name herbes de Provence is generic, and does not have Protected Geographical Status, there is no guarantee that any herb mixture on the market actually comes from Provence; indeed, the vast majority of these blends come from central and eastern Europe, North Africa, and China. Herbes de Provence are often sold in larger bags than other herbs, and the price in Provence is considerably lower than for other herbs. Uses Herbes de Provence are used to flavour grilled foods such as fish and meat, as well as vegetable stews. The mixture can be added to foods before or during cooking or mixed with cooking oil prior to cooking so as to infuse the flavour into the cooked food.

The 13-story southern wing, at 7th Avenue and 56th Street, contains Zankel Hall. =Main Hall (Stern Auditorium/Perelman Stage)= Isaac Stern Auditorium The Isaac Stern Auditorium seats 2,804 on five levels and was named after violinist Isaac Stern in 1997 to recognize his efforts to save the hall from demolition in the 1960s. The hall is six stories high with five levels of seating; visitors to the top balcony must climb 137 steps. All but the top level can be reached by elevator. The main hall was home to the performances of the New York Philharmonic from 1892 until 1962. Known as the most prestigious concert stage in the US, almost all of the leading classical music and, more recently, popular music performers since 1891 have performed there. After years of heavy wear and tear, the hall was extensively renovated in 1986 (see below). The Ronald O. Perelman Stage is 42 feet deep. The five levels of seating in the Stern Auditorium begin with the Parquet level, which has twenty-five full rows of thirty-eight seats and four partial rows at stage level, for a total of 1,021 seats. The First Tier and Second Tier consist of sixty-five boxes; the First Tier has 264 seats at eight seats per box and the Second Tier seats 238, with boxes ranging from six to eight seats each. Second from the top is the Dress Circle, seating 444 in six rows; the first two rows form an almost- complete semicircle. At the top, the balcony seats 837. Although seats with obstructed views exist throughout the auditorium, only the Dress Circle level has structural columns. =Zankel Hall= Zankel Hall, which seats 599, is named after Judy and Arthur Zankel. Originally called simply Recital Hall, this was the first auditorium to open to the public in April 1891. Following renovations made in 1896, it was renamed Carnegie Lyceum. It was leased to the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in 1898 and converted into a cinema, which opened as the Carnegie Hall Cinema in May 1961 with the film White Nights by Luchino Visconti. It was reclaimed for use as a performance space in 1997. The completely reconstructed Zankel Hall is flexible in design and can be reconfigured in several different arrangements to suit the needs of the performers. It opened in September 2003. The 599 seats in Zankel Hall are arranged in two levels. The parterre level seats a total of 463 and the mezzanine level seats 136. Each level has a number of seats which are situated along the side walls, perpendicular to the stage. These seats are designated as boxes; there are 54 seats in six boxes on the parterre level and 48 seats in four boxes on the mezzanine level. The boxes on the parterre level are raised above the level of the stage. Zankel Hall is accessible and its stage is 44 feet wide and 25 feet deep‚Äîthe stage occupies approximately one fifth of the performance space. =Weill Recital Hall= The Joan and Sanford I. Weill Recital Hall seats 268 and is named after Sanford I. Weill, a former chairman of the board, and his wife Joan. This auditorium, in use since the hall opened in 1891, was originally called Chamber Music Hall (later Carnegie Chamber Music Hall); the name was changed to Carnegie Recital Hall in the late 1940s, and finally became Joan and Sanford I. Weill Recital Hall in 1986. The Weill Recital Hall is the smallest of the three performance spaces, with a total of 268 seats. The Orchestra level contains fourteen rows of fourteen seats, a total of 196, and the Balcony level contains 72 seats in five rows. =Other facilities= The building also contains the Carnegie Hall Archives, established in 1986, and the Rose Museum, which opened in 1991. Until 2009 studios above the Hall contained working spaces for artists in the performing and graphic arts including music, drama, dance, as well as architects, playwrights, literary agents, photographers and painters. The spaces were unusual in being purpose-designed for artistic work, with very high ceilings, skylights and large windows for natural light. In 2007 the Carnegie Hall Corporation announced plans to evict the 33 remaining studio residents, some of whom had been in the building since the 1950s, including celebrity portrait photographer Editta Sherman and fashion photographer Bill Cunningham. The organization's research showed that Andrew Carnegie had always considered the spaces as a source of income to support the hall and its activities. The space has been re-purposed for music education and corporate offices. History= Founding and ownership = Andrew Carnegie, 1913 Carnegie Hall is named after Andrew Carnegie, who funded its construction. It was intended as a venue for the Oratorio Society of New York and the New York Symphony Society, on whose boards Carnegie served. Construction began in 1890, and was carried out by Isaac A. Hopper and Company. Although the building was in use from April 1891, the official opening night was May 5, with a concert conducted by Walter Damrosch and Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. Carnegie Hall in 1895 Carnegie Hall in 1910 The hall was owned by the Carnegie family until 1925, when Carnegie's widow sold it to a real estate developer, Robert E. Simon. When Simon died in 1935, his son, Robert E. Simon, Jr., became owner. By the mid-1950s, changes in the music business prompted Simon to offer Carnegie Hall for sale to the New York Philharmonic, which booked a majority of the hall's concert dates each year. The orchestra declined, since it planned to move to Lincoln Center, then in the early stages of planning. At the time, it was widely believed that New York City could not support two major concert venues. Facing the loss of the hall's primary tenant, Simon was forced to offer the building for sale. A deal with a commercial developer fell through, and in 1957, with the New York Philharmonic on the move to Lincoln Center, the building was slated for demolition to make way for a commercial skyscraper. Under pressure from a group led by violinist Isaac Stern and many of the artist residents, special legislation was passed that allowed the City of New York to buy the site from Simon for $5 million (which he would use to establish Reston, VA), and in May 1960 the nonprofit Carnegie Hall Corporation was created to run the venue. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1962. =Renovations and additions= In 1947, Robert Simon Jr., president of Carnegie Hall, undertook renovations of the hall which were carried out by New York firm, Kahn and Jacobs. The building was more extensively renovated in 1986 and 2003, by James Stewart Polshek, who became better known through his post-modern planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History. Polshek and his firm, Polshek Partnership, were involved since 1978 in four phases of the Hall's renovation and expansion including the creation of a Master Plan in 1980; the actual renovation of the main hall, the Stern Auditorium, and the creation of the Weill Recital Hall and Kaplan Rehearsal Space, all in 1986; the creation of the Rose Museum, East Room and Club Room (later renamed Rohatyn Room and Shorin Club Room, respectively), all in 1991; and, most recently, the creation of Zankel Hall in 2003. The renovation was not without controversy. Following completion of work on the main auditorium in 1986, there were complaints that the famous acoustics of the hall had been diminished. Although officials involved in the renovation denied that there was any change, complaints persisted for the next nine years. In 1995, the cause of the problem was discovered to be a slab of concrete under the stage. The slab was subsequently removed. Carnegie Hall Tower, skyscraper located next to Carnegie Hall. In June 2003, tentative plans were made for the Philharmonic to return to Carnegie Hall beginning in 2006, and for the orchestra to merge its business operations with those of the venue. However, the two groups abandoned these plans later in 2003. In 2014, Carnegie Hall opened its Judith and Burton Resnick Education Wing, which houses 24 music rooms, one of which is large enough to hold an orchestra or a chorus. The $230 million project was funded with gifts from Joan and Sanford I. Weill and the Weill Family Fund, Judith and Burton Resnick, Lily Safra and other donors, as well as $52.2 million from the city, $11 million from the state and $56.5 million from bonds issued through the Trust for Cultural Resources of the City of New York.  Use  Most of the greatest performers of classical music since the time Carnegie Hall was built have performed in the Main Hall, and its lobbies are adorned with signed portraits and memorabilia. The NBC Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Arturo Toscanini, frequently recorded in the Main Hall for RCA Victor. On November 14, 1943, the 25-year old Leonard Bernstein had his major conducting debut when he had to substitute for a suddenly ill Bruno Walter in a concert that was broadcast by CBS,Playbill and CBS announcement, concert on November 14, 1943 making him instantly famous. In the fall of 1950, the orchestra's weekly broadcast concerts were moved there until the orchestra disbanded in 1954. Several of the concerts were televised by NBC, preserved on kinescopes, and have been released on home video. Many legendary jazz and popular music performers have also given memorable performances at Carnegie Hall including Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington, Glenn Miller, Billie Holiday, Billy Eckstine, the Dave Brubeck Quartet, Keith Jarrett, Judy Garland, Harry Belafonte, Charles Aznavour, Simon and Garfunkel, Paul Robeson, Nina Simone, Shirley Bassey, James Taylor, and Stevie Ray Vaughan, all of whom made celebrated live recordings of their concerts there. The hall has also been the site of many famous lectures, including the Tuskegee Institute Silver Anniversary Lecture by Booker T. Washington, and the last public lecture by Mark Twain, both in 1906. Sissieretta Jones became the first African-American to sing at the Music Hall (renamed Carnegie Hall the following year), June 15, 1892. The Benny Goodman Orchestra gave a sold-out swing and jazz concert January 16, 1938. The bill also featured, among other guest performers, Count Basie and members of Duke Ellington's orchestra. Rock and roll music first came to Carnegie Hall when Bill Haley & His Comets appeared in a variety benefit concert on May 6, 1955. Rock acts were not regularly booked at the Hall however, until February 12, 1964, when The Beatles performed two shows during their historic first trip to the United States. Promoter Sid Bernstein convinced Carnegie officials that allowing a Beatles concert at the venue \\"would further international understanding\\" between the United States and Great Britain. \\"Led Zeppelin became the first hard rock act to play Carnegie Hall since the Rolling Stones tore the place up some five years ago.\\" Two concerts were performed October 17, 1969. Since then numerous rock, blues, jazz and country performers have appeared at the hall every season. Jethro Tull released the tapes recorded on its presentation in a 1970 Benefit concert, in the 2010 re-release of the Stand Up album. Ike & Tina Turner performed a concert April 1, 1971, which resulted in their album What You Hear is What You Get. The Beach Boys played concerts in 1971 and 1972, and two songs from the show appeared on their Endless Harmony Soundtrack. Chicago recorded its 4-LP box set Chicago at Carnegie Hall in 1971. European folk dance music first came to Carnegie Hall when concert of Yugoslav National Folk Ballet Tanec was performed on January 27, 1956. Ensemble Tanec was the first dance company from Yugoslavia to perform in America. The company performed folk dances from Macedonia, Serbia, Croatia and Albania. The 2015‚Äì2016 season celebrated the hall's 125th anniversary and the launch of an unprecedented commissioning project of at least 125 new works with 'Fifty for the Future\\" coming from Kronos (25 by female composers and 25 by male composers). Management and operations Since July 2005, the Executive and Artistic Director of Carnegie Hall is Sir Clive Gillinson, formerly managing director of the London Symphony Orchestra. The hall's operating budget for the 2008‚Äì2009 season was $84 million. For 2007‚Äì2008, operating costs exceeded revenues from operations by $40.2 million. With funding from donors, investment income and government grants, the hall ended that season with $1.9 million more in total revenues than total costs. Carnegie Hall Archives It emerged in 1986 that Carnegie Hall had never consistently maintained an archive. Without a central repository, a significant portion of Carnegie Hall's documented history had been dispersed. In preparation for the celebration of Carnegie Hall's centennial in 1991, the management established the Carnegie Hall Archives that year. Famous joke > Rumor is that a pedestrian on Fifty-seventh Street, Manhattan, stopped > Jascha Heifetz and inquired, \\"Could you tell me how to get to Carnegie > Hall?\\" \\"Yes,\\" said Heifetz. \\"Practice!\\" This joke has become part of the folklore of the hall, but its origins remain a mystery. Although described in 1961 as an \\"ancient wheeze\\", its earliest known appearances in print date from 1955. Attributions to Jack Benny are mistaken; it is uncertain if he ever used the joke. Alternatives to violinist Jascha Heifetz as the second party include an unnamed beatnik, bopper, or \\"absent-minded maestro\\", as well as pianist Arthur Rubinstein and trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie. Gino Francesconi, Carnegie Hall archivist, favours a version told by the wife of violinist Mischa Elman, in which her husband makes the quip when approached by tourists while leaving the hall's backstage entrance after an unsatisfactory rehearsal. The joke is so well known it is often reduced to a riddle with no framing story.

It was also the predecessor of the more powerful UKNC and DVK micros. Overview First released in 1984 (developed in 1983), they are based on the –ö1801–í–ú1 (Soviet LSI-11-compatible CPU) and were the only \\"official\\"Government approved and accounted for in economic planning Soviet home computer design in mass production. They sold for about 600‚Äì650 rubles. This was expensive,The average Soviet wage was about 150 rubles per month at the time. but marginally affordable, so they became one of the most popular home computer models in the Soviet Union, despite the fact that they had numerous problems. Later, in the 1990s, their powerful CPU and straightforward, easy-to-program design made them popular as demo machines. BK (–ë–ö) is a Russian abbreviation for ‚Äì domestic (or home) computer. The machines were also used for a short time as cash registers, for example, in the GUM department store. Although BK-0010 was one of the cheapest Soviet PCs, and in speed (as well as memory, graphics, and so on) differs little from the simple 8-bit models, it was one of the first fully 16-bit home computers in the world (in contrast to the TI-99/4A, BK had controllers with the same data bus-width). The Intellivision used a very similar, fully 16-bit CPU, the General Instrument CP1600, and with the Keyboard Component or ECS expansions, it was turned into a fully 16-bit home computer. The IBM PC and PCjr were 8/16-bit computers, as their 8088 CPU has an 8-bit data bus and a 16-bit internal bus. Software Vilnius BASIC on a BK-0010.01 The BK series was essentially a barebones machine, without any peripherals or development tools. The only software available at the launch (except ROM firmware) was an included magnetic tape with several programming examples (both for BASIC and FOCAL), and several tests. The ROM firmware includes a simple program to enter machine codes, BASIC and FOCAL interpreters. While the BK was somewhat compatible with larger and more expensive DVK professional model microcomputers and industrial minicomputers like the SM EVM series, its 32 KiB memory - of which only 16 KiB was generally available to programmers - (an extended memory mode supported 28 KiB, but limited video output to a quarter of the screen) generally precluded direct use of software for the more powerful machines. The DVK became a popular development platform for BK software, and when the BK memory was later extended to 128 KiB, most DVK software could be used directly with minimal changes. Homebrew developers quickly filled this niche, porting several development tools from DVK and UKNC. This led to an explosion of homebrew software, from text editors and databases to operating systems and games. Most BK owners expanded the built-in RAM to at least 64 KiB, which not only allowed easier software porting from more \\"grownup\\" systems, but as these upgrades often included floppy drive controllers, creating a one's own disk operating system became something of a competitive sport in the BK scene. Games and demo communities also flourished, as its anemic graphics were offset by a powerful CPU. One of the operating systems was ANDOS, although officially the computer was shipped with OS BK-11, a modification of RT-11. Hardware The machine is based on a powerful (for the time) 16-bit single-chip K1801VM1 CPU, clocked generally at 3 MHz.It is relatively easy to overclock the CPU, but slow DRAM made overclocking difficult. The most popular \\"turbo\\" speed is 5 MHz. It is almost perfectly compatible with Digital Equipment Corporation's LSI-11 line, though it lacks EIS and further instruction set extensions. The manufacturer also closely copied the PDP-11's internal architecture. Each model has one free card slot which is electrically, but not mechanically, compatible with Q-Bus. The first versions has 32 KiB onboard DRAM, half of which was used as video memory. That is extended to 128 KiB in later models, with video memory extended to two 16 KiB pages. Video output on all models is provided by the K1801VP1-037 VDC, a rather spartan chip. It is actually a standard 600-gate ULA with a VDC program that allows for two graphic video modes, high-res (512√ó256, monochrome) and low-res (256√ó256, 4 colors), and supported hardware vertical scrolling. Later models has 16 hardwired 4-color sets selectable from 64 color palette. It does not support text modes, but simulates two via BIOS routines: 32√ó25 and 64√ó25. Some operating systems such as ANDOS have managed to output text in 80√ó25 mode when displaying documents imported from IBM PC, by placing characters more densely. Output is through two separate 5-pin DIN connectors for a monochrome TV or color TV/monitor. Sound on all models is initially through a simple programmable counter connected to an onboard piezo speaker. Later, the General Instrument AY-3-8910 became a popular aftermarket addition. All models also has a 16-bit universal parallel port with separate input and output buses for connecting peripherals such as printers (Eastern Bloc printers used the incompatible –ò–†–ü–† interface instead of the more popular Centronics port, so Centronics printers needed an adapter), mice or Covox DACs for sound output, and tape recorder port for data storage. Later models includes a manufacturer-supplied floppy drive controller (that can be plugged into a Q-Bus slot) by default. It was available for earlier models as an aftermarket part, but homebrew ones (that also often extends rather anemic 16K memory of original BK) are more popular. A cottage industry for such peripherals and mods flourished. =Versions= BK0010-01 System Board Electronika BK-0010 is the first model (originally released in 1983, the serial production since mid-1984). It has a pseudo-membrane keyboard (an array of mechanical microswitches without keycaps, covered by flexible overlay), 32 KiB RAM, 8 KiB ROM with BIOS (chip K1801RE2-017), 8 KiB ROM with FOCAL interpreter (K1801RE2-018), 8 KiB ROM with debugger (K1801RE2-019) and one free ROM slot, and its CPU is clocked at 3 MHz. A tape recorder is used for data storage in the factory configuration. This model was criticized for its uncomfortable keyboard ‚Äì while mechanical in nature, lack of keycaps lead to the same unsatisfactory tactile response, that was seen as unacceptable when the machine was used in home or educational settings, although such keyboard could be easily sealed completely, so this version found widespread use as an industrial controller. Other points of criticism included the archaic FOCAL programming language supplied by default and the complete lack of peripherals and software. While all hardware was well documented and easy to work with, the machine was delivered without any programming tools. Electronika BK-0010.01 The follow-up version, –ë–ö-0010.01 (sometimes referred to as -0010-01), is essentially the same machine, but with a conventional full-travel keyboard and a Vilnius BASIC p-code compiler in the ROM, correcting the weakest points of its predecessor. While the BASIC dialect used is quite powerful and well-optimized (it is actually a somewhat scaled- down clone of MSX BASIC), the keyboard is a mixed blessing. While it is much more comfortable to work with, its quality left much to be desired, and the keys were prone to sticking, significant bounce and wore quickly, though a model with a further improved keyboard became available later. The FOCAL interpreter was not dropped but instead shipped on an external ROM cartridge that could be inserted into the Q-Bus slot. Electronika BK-0010Sh is a model intended specially for school use. It can be either the ‚àí0010 or ‚àí0010.01 model but was supplied with a special current loop network adapter rated at 19200 bps, which can be inserted into the Q-Bus slot. Based on ULA chip K1801VP1-035 (and later on K1801VP1-065), the adapter is compatible to DEC DL-11 and KL-11 serial interfaces, but without modem control bits. It also includes a monitor (usually a modified Yunost' compact TV), since in school setting it couldn't be expected to be connected to household TV. Electronika BK-0011 BK-0011 was released in 1989. It has 128 KiB of RAM divided into 16 KiB pages, its CPU is clocked at 4 MHz by default; it includes a newer version of BASIC in ROM and 16 selectable video palettes, which were almost universally criticized by users for their odd color combinations. It has a floppy controller, but the drive was still sold separately. Electronika BK-0011M BK 0011M Some changes in the BK-0011, while minor, made it incompatible with earlier -0010 models. In particular, it can not load 0010 programs from a cassette tape. Even if it could have loaded them, crucial subsystems, such as sound, are still incompatible. Public outcry forced the manufacturer to redesign the machine, restoring compatibility with earlier models. The resulting model, the BK-0011M, quickly went into production, and most BK-0011 series computers are actually BK-0011Ms. Since the modifications were minor, most of the handful of -0011 models that made it to market were upgraded to -0011M models by enthusiasts. =Mods= It was not uncommon among owners to install one or two mechanical switches that made using the computer more convenient. Some of the common mods were: * Reset button. Programs often hung. Also, some games did not have a properly implemented Exit function. Without this button, the computer had to be reset by power cycling, which eventually led to a worn out power switch on the external power supply. The reset interrupt can be caught by the operating system, so under such systems (for example, ANDOS, MK-DOS), the reset button exits to the OS's file manager. * Pause switch. This switch activated hardware suspension of instruction execution in the processor. The pause switch was useful for pausing games, most of which did not have a pause key. A few games, however, did not behave gracefully after being returned from suspension, because the programmable hardware timer built into the processor chip is still running while the instruction execution was suspended. The BK also has a software key combination for pause. * Clock speed switch (\\"turbo\\" switch). This changes the processor clock speed from the standard 3 MHz (BK-0010* series) to 4 or 6 MHz, or from the standard 4 MHz (BK-0011* series) to 3 or 6 MHz. Not all processor samples work reliably at 6 MHz; the possibility of such overclocking has to be determined experimentally for each sample. Switching the clock speed changes the pace of dynamic games. The turbo switch usually has to be installed together with the pause switch, because the simplest circuit for switching the clock speed produces bad shapes in the clock signal due to contact bounce when the mechanical switch was flipped, running the risk of hanging the software execution unless the processor is in the suspended state. * Sound on/off switch, or sound volume knob, which adjusts the volume level of the internal piezoelectric speaker using a potentiometer. At this same time as adding this, the modder can replace the speaker with a louder one. These modifications are relatively simple and can be carried out by users who knew how to handle a soldering iron. Most of the people in the program sales cottage industry can also do the mods for a small fee. Enthusiasts also managed to connect more advanced devices to BK series computers: they developed a hard disk controller, and 2.5\\" HDDs were successfully used with BK computers. Other popular enhancements are AY-3-8912 sound chips and Covox Speech Thing. Emulators There are various software emulators of BK for modern IBM PC compatible computers. An emulator is able to run at a much higher speed than the original BK. There are also fairly complete re- implementations of the BK for FPGA-based systems, such as the MiST.

The current capital of Wales is Cardiff. Historically, Wales did not have a definite capital. In 1955, the Minister for Welsh Affairs informally proclaimed Cardiff to be the capital of Wales. Since 1964, Cardiff has been home to government offices for Wales, and since 1999 it has been the seat of the Senedd. History In the past, multiple places have served as a seat of the government of Wales, including: *Strata Florida Abbey, the Cistercian abbey where Llywelyn the Great held council in 1238. *Machynlleth, where Owain Glynd≈µr held a parliament in 1404. *Ludlow (Welsh Llwydlo, located in Shropshire), seat of the Council of Wales and the Marches from 1473 to 1689. The ecclesiastical capital of Wales is St Davids, the resting place of the country's patron saint, Saint David. In the 19th century, Cardiff grew to become the largest settlement in Wales, due to its role as a port for exporting coal from the South Wales Valleys. By 1881, it had overtaken both Swansea and Merthyr Tydfil to become the country's largest city. In 1905, Cardiff received city status. In subsequent years, an increasing number of Welsh national institutions were founded in the city, including the National Museum of Wales, Welsh National War Memorial, and the University of Wales Registry Building. However, the National Library of Wales would instead be located in Aberystwyth, where it remains to this day. This was partly because the library's founder, Sir John Williams, did not think that Cardiff was a Welsh city in character. In 1911, the tradition of holding an investiture of the Prince of Wales was revived, and took place in Caernarfon. In the 20th century, Welsh local authorities debated where a new capital of Wales should be, with 76 out of 161 opting for Cardiff in a 1924 poll, organised by the South Wales Daily News. The authorities were mostly split between Cardiff and Caernarfon, with a smaller faction supporting Aberystwyth. The discussions stalled and progress was not made until 1950. =Recognition of Cardiff= The government of the Labour Prime Minister, Clement Attlee, had not named a capital of Wales during his government. Attlee noted that a number of cities made claims to the status, and that the Council for Wales and Monmouthshire did not raise what he considered to be a \\"domestic issue\\" with the Government. In his inaugural speech as Lord Mayor of Cardiff, George Williams argued that Cardiff should be considered the capital of Wales. David Llewellyn was elected MP for Cardiff North in 1950 and also campaigned for recognising Cardiff. Campaigning for Cardiff stepped up and the city took steps to promote its 'Welshness'. The stalemate over which city should be the new capital was broken when Cardiganshire County Council decided to support Cardiff and, in a 1955 poll of local authorities, 134 out of 161 voted for the city. On 20 December 1955, Gwilym Lloyd-George, then Minister for Welsh Affairs and Home Secretary, proclaimed that Cardiff was the capital of Wales, in a reply to a question from David Llewellyn. Lloyd-George said that \\"no formal measures are necessary to give effect to this decision\\"Hansard 20 December 1955 vol 547 cc310-1W The Encyclopedia of Wales says that the decision to recognise the city as the capital of Wales \\"had more to do with the fact that it contained marginal Conservative constituencies than any reasoned view of what functions a Welsh capital should have\\". =Government institutions= Cardiff only became a centre of national administration with the establishment of the Welsh Office in 1964, which later prompted the creation of various other public bodies such as the Arts Council of Wales and the Welsh Development Agency, most of which were based in Cardiff. In a 1997 referendum, Wales narrowly voted in favour of establishing a National Assembly for Wales, although only 44% supported the proposal in Cardiff.Balsom, Denis. 'The referendum result'. In Jones, James Barry; Balsom, Denis (ed.), The road to the National Assembly for Wales. Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 2000. Due to the relative lack of support for the Assembly locally, and disagreements between the Welsh Office and Cardiff Council over where it should sit, there was a brief period of speculation that the Assembly would be established elsewhere. However, the Assembly eventually located at T≈∑ Hywel in Cardiff Bay in 1999. It has been based there ever since, moving to its present building in 2005.

The capital of Germany is the city state of Berlin. It is the seat of the President of Germany, whose official residence is Schloss Bellevue. The Bundesrat (\\"federal council\\") is the representation of the Federal States (Bundesl√§nder) of Germany and has its seat at the former Prussian Herrenhaus (House of Lords). Though most of the ministries are seated in Berlin, some of them, as well as some minor departments, are seated in Bonn, the former capital of West Germany. Pre-1871 Prior to 1871, Germany was not a unified nation state, and had no capital city. The medieval German Holy Roman Empire, used to have Aachen as its preferred seat of government during Charlemagne's reign, and until 1531 it was the place where 31 Holy Roman Emperors were crowned Kings of the Germans. The coronation later moved to Frankfurt. However, after Charlemagne, none of the subsequent Holy Roman Emperors moved to Aachen or Frankfurt, instead retaining their own original constituent kingdom or principality as base or moving into temporary Royal palaces dotted around the confederate realm known as Kaiserpfalz. The last imperial ruling house (the Habsburgs) had Vienna as its permanent seat of government. After the Congress of Vienna created the formal German Confederation in 1815, a Federal Assembly convened at the Free City of Frankfurt, representing not the people of the individual German Lands but their sovereigns. Subsequently, Frankfurt briefly became the official German capital during the short-lived Revolutions of 1848 in the German states. Since 1871 It was only during the 1871 Unification of Germany that the newly unified German Empire was first assigned an official capital. Since Berlin was the capital of Prussia, the leading state of the new Reich, it became the capital of Germany as well. Berlin had been the capital of Prussia and its predecessor, Brandenburg, since 1518. Berlin remained the capital of the united Germany until 1945. However, for a period of a few months following the First World War, the national assembly met in Weimar because civil war was ravaging Berlin. After the capture of Berlin in 1945, Flensburg briefly served as capital. Germany was then occupied by the Allies as the outcome of World War II, and Berlin ceased to be the capital of a sovereign German state. In 1949, with sovereignty regained the country split up into West Germany and East Germany. Berlin was also divided, into West Berlin and East Berlin. Originally, Frankfurt was to be the provisional capital of West Germany. However, West German authorities intended to make Berlin the capital if Germany were ever reunified. They feared that since Frankfurt was a major city in its own right, it would ultimately be accepted as a permanent capital and weaken West German support for reunification. For this reason, the capital was located in the smaller university city of Bonn as a more obviously provisional solution. Another factor was that Bonn is close to Cologne, the hometown of West Germany's first chancellor, Konrad Adenauer. East Germany claimed East Berlin as its capital, even though Berlin as a whole was still legally occupied territory, and would remain so for 45 years. In 1990, with the reunification of Germany, Berlin was also reunified and became the capital of the enlarged Federal Republic of Germany. There was some debate, however, on whether the seat of government should move to Berlin. Many believed that Bonn should remain the seat of government ‚Äì a situation analogous to that of the Netherlands, where Amsterdam is the capital but The Hague is the seat of government. In 1991, after an emotional debate, the Bundestag voted to move the seat of government to Berlin by 1999. Although Berlin is officially the capital of the Federal Republic of Germany, 8,000 out of the 18,000 total officials employed at the federal bureaucracy still work in Bonn, 596 km (375 miles) away from Berlin.

It lies above the convergent plate margin between the African Plate and the Eurasian Plate. It is the highest active volcano in Europe outside the Caucasus and the highest peak in Italy south of the Alps with a current height of , though this varies with summit eruptions. Etna covers an area of with a basal circumference of . This makes it by far the largest of the three active volcanoes in Italy, being about two and a half times the height of the next largest, Mount Vesuvius. Only Mount Teide on Tenerife in the Canary Islands surpasses it in the whole of the European‚ÄìNorth-African region west of the Black Sea. In Greek mythology, the deadly monster Typhon was trapped under this mountain by Zeus, the god of the sky and thunder and king of gods, and the forges of Hephaestus were said also to be underneath it.Aelian, Hist. An. xi. 3, referenced under Aetnaeus in William Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology Mount Etna is one of the world's most active volcanoes and is in an almost constant state of activity. The fertile volcanic soils support extensive agriculture, with vineyards and orchards spread across the lower slopes of the mountain and the broad Plain of Catania to the south. Due to its history of recent activity and nearby population, Mount Etna has been designated a Decade Volcano by the United Nations. In June 2013, it was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Relief map Etna seen behind the Rocca di Novara, Peloritani mountains Etymology and folklore The word Etna is from the Greek Œ±·º¥Œ∏œâ (aith≈ç), meaning \\"I burn\\", through an iotacist pronunciation.According to Adrian Room's book Place-names of the World, the name \\"Etna\\" originated from the Phoenician word ' meaning \\"furnace\\" or \\"chimney\\". He dismisses the hypothesis that 'Etna' has a Greek derivation. In Classical Greek, it is called (A√≠tnƒì), a name given also to Catania and the city originally known as Inessa. In Latin it is called Aetna. In Arabic, it was called ' (the Mountain of Fire). It is also known as Mungibeddu in Sicilian and Mongibello or Montebello in Italian (the Italian word literally means \\"beautiful mountain\\"). According to another hypothesis, the term Mongibello comes from the Latin Mulciber (qui ignem mulcet, \\"who placates the fire\\"), one of the Latin names of the Roman god Vulcan. Another theory is that Mongibello came from the Italian word monte plus the Arabic word jabal, both meaning \\"mountain.\\" Today, the name Mongibello is used for the area of Mount Etna containing the two central craters, and the craters located southeast and northeast of the volcanic cone. The name Mongibel is found in Arthurian Romance, as the name of the otherworld castle (or realm) of Morgan le Fay and her half-brother, King Arthur, localised at Etna, according to traditions concerning them derived from the stories told by the Breton conteurs who accompanied the Norman occupiers of Sicily. What were originally Welsh conceptions concerning a dwarf king of a paradisal, Celtic underworld became attached to the quasi-historic figure of Arthur as \\"Ruler of the Antipodes\\" and were then transplanted into a Sicilian milieu, by Bretons impressed by the already otherworldly associations of the great, volcanic mountain of their new home. Mediaevalist Roger Sherman Loomis quotes passages from the works of Gervase of Tilbury and Caesarius of Heisterbach (dating from the late twelfth century) featuring accounts of Arthur's returning of a lost horse which had strayed into his subterranean kingdom beneath Etna. Caesarius quotes as his authority for the story a certain canon Godescalcus of Bonn, who considered it a matter of historical fact of the time of Emperor Henry's conquest of Sicily circa 1194. Caesarius employs in his account the Latin phrase in monte Gyber (\\"within Etna\\") to describe the location of Arthur's kingdom.Bruce, Christopher W. (1999). The Arthurian Name Dictionary.

The Fada de Gibel of the Castle of Gibaldar (Fairy of Etna) appears in Jaufre, the only surviving Arthurian romance in the Occitan language, the composition of which is dated to between 1180 and 1230. However, in Jaufre, while it is clear from her name that the fairy queen in question is Morgan le Fay, the rich underworld queendom of which she is the mistress is accessed, not through a fiery grotto on the slopes of Etna, but through a 'fountain' (i.e., a spring) ‚Äì a circumstance more in keeping with Morgan's original watery, rather than fiery, associations, before her incorporation into the folklore of Sicily.Arthurian Literature in the Middle Ages: A Collaborative History ed.

History of volcanic eruptions=Geological history= Mount Etna from the south with the smoking peak in the upper left and a lateral crater in the centre. Volcanic activity first took place at Etna about 500,000 years ago, with eruptions occurring beneath the sea off the ancient coastline of Sicily. About 300,000 years ago, volcanism began occurring to the southwest of the summit (centre top of the volcano), then activity moved towards the present centre 170,000 years ago. Eruptions at this time built up the first major volcanic edifice, forming a stratovolcano in alternating explosive and effusive eruptions. The growth of the mountain was occasionally interrupted by major eruptions, leading to the collapse of the summit to form calderas. From about 35,000 to 15,000 years ago, Etna experienced some highly explosive eruptions, generating large pyroclastic flows, which left extensive ignimbrite deposits. Ash from these eruptions has been found as far away as south of Rome's border, to the north. Thousands of years ago, the eastern flank of the mountain experienced a catastrophic collapse, generating an enormous landslide in an event similar to that seen in the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. The landslide left a large depression in the side of the volcano, known as 'Valle del Bove' (Valley of the Ox). Research published in 2006 suggested this occurred around 8,000 years ago, and caused a huge tsunami, which left its mark in several places in the eastern Mediterranean. It may have been the reason the settlement of Atlit Yam (Israel), now below sea level, was suddenly abandoned around that time. The steep walls of the valley have suffered subsequent collapses on numerous occasions. The strata exposed in the valley walls provide an important and easily accessible record of Etna's eruptive history. The most recent collapse event at the summit of Etna is thought to have occurred about 2,000 years ago, forming what is known as the Piano Caldera. This caldera has been almost entirely filled by subsequent lava eruptions but is still visible as a distinct break in the slope of the mountain near the base of the present-day summit cone. Mount Etna is moving towards the Mediterranean Sea at an average rate of per year, the massif sliding on an unconsolidated layer above the older sloping terrain.Gravitational collapse of Mount Etna‚Äôs southeastern flank =Eruptions=Historical eruptions Eruptions of Etna follow a variety of patterns. Most occur at the summit, where there are five distinct craters ‚Äì the Northeast Crater, the Voragine, the Bocca Nuova, and the Southeast Crater Complex (2). Other eruptions occur on the flanks, which have more than 300 vents ranging in size from small holes in the ground to large craters hundreds of metres across. Summit eruptions can be highly explosive and spectacular but rarely threaten the inhabited areas around the volcano. In contrast, flank eruptions can occur down to a few hundred metres altitude, close to or even well within the inhabited areas. Numerous villages and small towns lie around or on cones of past flank eruptions. Since the year AD 1600, at least 60 flank eruptions and countless summit eruptions have occurred; nearly half of these have happened since the start of the 20th century. Since 2000, Etna has had four flank eruptions ‚Äì in 2001, 2002‚Äì2003, 2004‚Äì2005, and 2008‚Äì2009. Summit eruptions occurred in 2006, 2007‚Äì2008, January‚ÄìApril 2012, in July‚ÄìOctober 2012 and again in December 2018. The first known record of eruption at Etna is that of Diodorus Siculus. An artist's impression of the 1766 eruption In 396 BC, an eruption of Etna reportedly thwarted the Carthaginians in their attempt to advance on Syracuse during the Second Sicilian War. A particularly violent explosive (Plinian) summit eruption occurred in 122 BC, and caused heavy tephra falls to the southeast, including the town of Catania, where many roofs collapsed. To help with reconstruction after the devastating effects of the eruption, the Roman government exempted the population of Catania from paying taxes for ten years. The Roman poet Virgil gave what was probably a first-hand description of an eruption in the Aeneid.Aeneid, edition of Theodore C. Williams, ca. 1908 [book III, lines 569‚Äì579] During the first 1500 years AD, many eruptions went unrecorded (or records have been lost); among the more significant are: (1) an eruption in about 1030 AD near Monte Ilice on the lower southeast flank, which produced a lava flow that travelled about 10 km, reaching the sea north of Acireale; the villages of Santa Tecla and Stazzo are built on the broad delta built by this lava flow into the sea; (2) an eruption in about 1160 (or 1224), from a fissure at only elevation on the south-southeast flank near the village of Mascalucia, whose lava flow reached the sea just to the north of Catania, in the area now occupied by the portion of the city named Ognina. Rabban Bar Sauma, a Chinese traveller to the West, recorded the eruption of Etna on 18 June 1287.The history of the life and travels of Rabban Sawma The 1669 eruption, Etna's most destructive since 122 BC, started on 11 March 1669 and produced lava flows that destroyed at least 10 villages on its southern flank before reaching the city walls of the town of Catania five weeks later, on 15 April. The lava was largely diverted by these walls into the sea to the south of the city, filling the harbour of Catania. A small portion of lava eventually broke through a fragile section of the city walls on the western side of Catania and destroyed a few buildings before stopping in the rear of the Benedictine monastery, without reaching the centre of the town. Contrary to widespread reports of up to 15,000 (or even 20,000) human fatalities caused by the lava,\\"Mount Etna (volcano, Italy)\\". (the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica has been wrongly cited as one source of this false information). contemporaneous accounts written both in Italian and EnglishThe Encyclopaedia Britannica 5th edition (1817) quotes from the eyewitness report of Lord Winchelsea, Ambassador to Constantinople, to the Court of England. It happens not to mention casualties. See also: mention no deaths related to the 1669 eruption (but give very precise figures of the number of buildings destroyed, the area of cultivated land lost, and the economic damage). Therefore, it is uncertain where the enormous number of fatalities can be attributed. One possibility is confusion between this eruption and an earthquake that devastated southeast Sicily (including Catania) 24 years later in 1693. A study on the damage and fatalities caused by eruptions of Etna in historical times reveals that only 77 human deaths are attributable with certainty to eruptions of Etna, most recently in 1987 when two tourists were killed by a sudden explosion near the summit. Recent eruptions Footage of Etna's November 2013 eruption. A large lava flow from an eruption in 1928 led to the destruction of a population centre for the first time since the 1669 eruption. The eruption started high on Etna's northeast flank on 2 November. Then new eruptive fissures opened at decreasing elevations down the flank of the volcano. The third and most vigorous of these fissures opened late on 4 November at an unusually low elevation, approximately above sea-level, in a zone known as Ripe della Naca. The village of Mascali, lying down-slope of the Ripe della Naca, was almost completely destroyed in two days. Only a church and a few surrounding buildings survived in the north part of the village, called Sant'Antonino or \\"il quartiere\\". During the last days of the eruption, the flow interrupted the Messina-Catania railway line and destroyed the train station of Mascali. The event was used by Benito Mussolini's fascist regime for propaganda purposes, with the evacuation, aid, and rebuilding operations being presented as models of fascist planning. Mascali was rebuilt on a new site, and its church contains the Italian fascist symbol of the torch, placed above the statue of Jesus Christ. Other major 20th-century eruptions occurred in 1949, 1971, 1979, 1981, 1983 and 1991‚Äì1993. In 1971, lava buried the Etna Observatory (built in the late 19th century), destroyed the first generation of the Etna cable-car, and seriously threatened several small villages on Etna's east flank. In March 1981, the town of Randazzo on the northwestern flank of Etna narrowly escaped destruction by unusually fast-moving lava flows. That eruption was remarkably similar to one in 1928 that destroyed Mascali. The 1991‚Äì1993 eruption saw the town of Zafferana threatened by a lava flow, but successful diversion efforts saved the town with the loss of only one building a few hundred metres from the town's margin. Initially, such efforts consisted of the construction of earth barriers built perpendicularly to the flow direction; it was hoped that the eruption would stop before the artificial basins created behind the barriers would be completely filled. Instead, the eruption continued, and lava surmounted the barriers, heading directly toward Zafferana. Engineers then decided to use explosives near the source of the lava flow, to disrupt a very efficient lava tube system through which the lava travelled for up to without losing significant heat or fluidity. The main explosion on 23 May 1992 destroyed the tube and forced the lava into a new artificial channel, far from Zafferana, and it would have taken months to re-establish a long lava tube. Shortly after the blasting, the rate of lava emission dropped, and during the remainder of the eruption (until 30 March 1993) the lava never advanced close to the town again. A lateral crater of the 2002‚Äì2003 eruption near the Torre del Filosofo, about below Etna's summit. House destroyed by lava on the slopes of Etna. Following six years (1995‚Äì2001) of unusually intense activity at the four summit craters of Etna, the volcano produced its first flank eruption since 1991‚Äì1993 in July‚ÄìAugust 2001. This eruption, which involved activity from seven distinct eruptive fissures mostly on the south slope of the volcano, was well covered by the mass-media because it occurred at the height of the tourist season and numerous reporters and journalists were already in Italy to cover the G8 summit in Genoa. It also occurred close to one of the tourist areas on the volcano, and thus was easily accessible. Part of the \\"Etna Sud\\" tourist area, including the arrival station of the Etna cable car, were damaged by this eruption, which otherwise was a rather modest-sized event by Etna standards. In 2002‚Äì2003, a much larger eruption threw up a huge column of ash that could easily be seen from space and fell as far away as Libya, south across the Mediterranean Sea. Seismic activity in this eruption caused the eastern flanks of the volcano to slip by up to two metres, and many houses on the flanks of the volcano experienced structural damage. The eruption also completely destroyed the tourist station Piano Provenzana, on the northeastern flank of the volcano, and part of the tourist station \\"Etna Sud\\" around the Rifugio Sapienza on the south flank. Footage from the eruptions was recorded by Lucasfilm and integrated into the landscape of the planet Mustafar in the 2005 film Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith. The Rifugio Sapienza is near the site of a cable car station which had previously been destroyed in the 1983 eruption; it has now been rebuilt. Following a slow and non- destructive lava outflow on the upper southeastern flank between September 2004 and March 2005, intense eruptions occurred at the Southeast Crater in July‚ÄìDecember 2006. These were followed by four episodes of lava fountaining, again at the Southeast Crater, on 29 March 11 April 29 April and 7 May 2007. Ash emissions and Strombolian explosions started from a vent on the eastern side of the Southeast Crater in mid-August 2007. On 4 September 2007, a major episode of lava fountaining occurred from the new vent on the east side of the Southeast Crater, also producing a plume of ash and scoriae which fell over the east flank of the volcano. A lava flow travelled about into the uninhabited Valle del Bove. This eruption was visible far into the plains of Sicily, ending the following morning between the hours of 5 to 7 a.m. local time. Catania-Fontanarossa Airport shut down operations during the night for safety precautions. An eruption on the morning of 13 May 2008, immediately to the east of Etna's summit craters was accompanied by a swarm of more than 200 earthquakes and significant ground deformation in the summit area. The eruption continued at a slowly diminishing rate for 417 days, until 6 July 2009, making this the longest flank eruption of Etna since the 1991‚Äì1993 eruption that lasted 473 days. Previous eruptions, in 2001, 2002‚Äì2003, and 2004‚Äì2005 had lasted 3 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months, respectively. Lava flows advanced 6.5 km during the first few days of this eruption but thereafter stagnated at many minor distances from the vents; during the last months of the eruption lava rarely advanced more than 1 km downslope. Southern flank of Mount Etna showing lateral cones and flow from the eruption of 2001. Through January 2011 to February 2012, the summit craters of Etna were the site of intense activity. Frequent eruptions and ash columns forced the authorities to shut down the Catania airport on several occasions. The July 2011 episode also endangered the Sapienza Refuge, the main tourist hub on the volcano, but the lava flow was successfully diverted. In 2014, a flank eruption started involving lava flows and strombolian eruptions. This was the first flank eruption since 2008‚Äì09 On 3 December 2015, an eruption occurred which climaxed between 03:20 and 04:10 local time. The Voragine crater exhibited a lava fountain which reached in height, with an ash plume which reached in height. The activity continued on the following days, with an ash plume that reached in height that forced Catania airport to shut down for a few hours. Volcanic gas emissions from this volcano are measured by a Multi-Component Gas Analyzer System, which detects pre-eruptive degassing of rising magmas, improving prediction of volcanic activity. An eruption on 16 March 2017 injured 10 people, including a BBC News television crew, after magma exploded upon contact with snow. An eruption on 24 December 2018, following a dyke intrusion at shallow depth, spewed ash into the air, forcing the closure of airspace around Mount Etna. Two days later, a magnitude 4.9 earthquake shook the nearby city of Catania, damaging buildings and injuring four people. Volcanic explosivity index of recent eruptions The Global Volcanism Program has assigned a volcanic explosivity index (VEI) to all of Mount Etna's eruptions since January 1955: Smoke rings In the 1970s Etna erupted smoke rings, one of the first captured events of this type, which are extremely rare. This happened again in 2000. Video footage of 8 June 2000 event was captured by naturalist filmmaker Geoff Mackley. Another event occurred on 11 April 2013. Geopolitical boundaries Map of municipalities in the province of Catania. The borders of ten municipalities (Adrano, Biancavilla, Belpasso, Bronte (from two sides), Castiglione di Sicilia, Maletto, Nicolosi, Randazzo, Sant'Alfio, Zafferana Etnea) meet on the summit of Mount Etna, making this point one of elevenfold complexity. Facilities Sapienza Refuge, the main tourist hub. Etna North Linguaglossa and Etna South Nicolosi are the two ski resorts of the volcano Etna is one of Sicily's main tourist attractions, with thousands of visitors every year. The most common route is through the road leading to Sapienza Refuge ski area, lying at the south of the crater at elevation of 1910 m. From the Refuge, a cableway runs uphill to an elevation of 2500 m, from where the crater area at 2920 m is accessible. Ferrovia Circumetnea ‚Äì Round-Etna railway ‚Äì is a narrow-gauge railway constructed between 1889 and 1895. It runs around the volcano in a 110-km long semi-circle starting in Catania and ending in Riposto 28 km north of Catania. There are two ski resorts on Etna: one at the Sapienza Refuge, with a chairlift and three ski lifts, and a smaller one on the north, at Piano Provenzana near Linguaglossa, with three lifts and a chairlift. Sapienza Refuge was the finish of Stage 9 of the 2011 Giro d'Italia and Stage 4 of the 2017 Giro.

Foundations of mathematics can be conceived as the study of the basic mathematical concepts (set, function, geometrical figure, number, etc.) and how they form hierarchies of more complex structures and concepts, especially the fundamentally important structures that form the language of mathematics (formulas, theories and their models giving a meaning to formulas, definitions, proofs, algorithms, etc.) also called metamathematical concepts, with an eye to the philosophical aspects and the unity of mathematics. The search for foundations of mathematics is a central question of the philosophy of mathematics; the abstract nature of mathematical objects presents special philosophical challenges. The foundations of mathematics as a whole does not aim to contain the foundations of every mathematical topic. Generally, the foundations of a field of study refers to a more-or-less systematic analysis of its most basic or fundamental concepts, its conceptual unity and its natural ordering or hierarchy of concepts, which may help to connect it with the rest of human knowledge. The development, emergence and clarification of the foundations can come late in the history of a field, and might not be viewed by everyone as its most interesting part. Mathematics always played a special role in scientific thought, serving since ancient times as a model of truth and rigor for rational inquiry, and giving tools or even a foundation for other sciences (especially physics). Mathematics' many developments towards higher abstractions in the 19th century brought new challenges and paradoxes, urging for a deeper and more systematic examination of the nature and criteria of mathematical truth, as well as a unification of the diverse branches of mathematics into a coherent whole. The systematic search for the foundations of mathematics started at the end of the 19th century and formed a new mathematical discipline called mathematical logic, which later had strong links to theoretical computer science. It went through a series of crises with paradoxical results, until the discoveries stabilized during the 20th century as a large and coherent body of mathematical knowledge with several aspects or components (set theory, model theory, proof theory, etc.), whose detailed properties and possible variants are still an active research field. Its high level of technical sophistication inspired many philosophers to conjecture that it can serve as a model or pattern for the foundations of other sciences.  Historical context = Ancient Greek mathematics = While the practice of mathematics had previously developed in other civilizations, special interest in its theoretical and foundational aspects was clearly evident in the work of the Ancient Greeks. Early Greek philosophers disputed as to which is more basic, arithmetic or geometry. Zeno of Elea (490 c. 430 BC) produced four paradoxes that seem to show the impossibility of change. The Pythagorean school of mathematics originally insisted that only natural and rational numbers exist. The discovery of the irrationality of , the ratio of the diagonal of a square to its side (around 5th century BC), was a shock to them which they only reluctantly accepted. The discrepancy between rationals and reals was finally resolved by Eudoxus of Cnidus (408‚Äì355 BC), a student of Plato, who reduced the comparison of irrational ratios to comparisons of multiples (rational ratios), thus anticipating the definition of real numbers by Richard Dedekind (1831-1916). In the Posterior Analytics, Aristotle (384‚Äì322 BC) laid down the axiomatic method for organizing a field of knowledge logically by means of primitive concepts, axioms, postulates, definitions, and theorems. Aristotle took a majority of his examples for this from arithmetic and from geometry. This method reached its high point with Euclid's Elements (300 BC), a treatise on mathematics structured with very high standards of rigor: Euclid justifies each proposition by a demonstration in the form of chains of syllogisms (though they do not always conform strictly to Aristotelian templates). Aristotle's syllogistic logic, together with the axiomatic method exemplified by Euclid's Elements, are recognized as scientific achievements of ancient Greece. = Platonism as a traditional philosophy of mathematics = Starting from the end of the 19th century, a Platonist view of mathematics became common among practicing mathematicians. The concepts or, as Platonists would have it, the objects of mathematics are abstract and remote from everyday perceptual experience: geometrical figures are conceived as idealities to be distinguished from effective drawings and shapes of objects, and numbers are not confused with the counting of concrete objects. Their existence and nature present special philosophical challenges: How do mathematical objects differ from their concrete representation? Are they located in their representation, or in our minds, or somewhere else? How can we know them? The ancient Greek philosophers took such questions very seriously. Indeed, many of their general philosophical discussions were carried on with extensive reference to geometry and arithmetic. Plato (424/423 BC 348/347 BC) insisted that mathematical objects, like other platonic Ideas (forms or essences), must be perfectly abstract and have a separate, non- material kind of existence, in a world of mathematical objects independent of humans. He believed that the truths about these objects also exist independently of the human mind, but is discovered by humans. In the Meno Plato's teacher Socrates asserts that it is possible to come to know this truth by a process akin to memory retrieval. Above the gateway to Plato's academy appeared a famous inscription: \\"Let no one who is ignorant of geometry enter here\\". In this way Plato indicated his high opinion of geometry. He regarded geometry as \\"the first essential in the training of philosophers\\", because of its abstract character. This philosophy of Platonist mathematical realism is shared by many mathematicians. It can be argued that Platonism somehow comes as a necessary assumption underlying any mathematical work.Karlis Podnieks, Platonism, intuition and the nature of mathematics: 1. Platonism - the Philosophy of Working Mathematicians In this view, the laws of nature and the laws of mathematics have a similar status, and the effectiveness ceases to be unreasonable. Not our axioms, but the very real world of mathematical objects forms the foundation. Aristotle dissected and rejected this view in his Metaphysics. These questions provide much fuel for philosophical analysis and debate. = Middle Ages and Renaissance = For over 2,000 years, Euclid's Elements stood as a perfectly solid foundation for mathematics, as its methodology of rational exploration guided mathematicians, philosophers, and scientists well into the 19th century. The Middle Ages saw a dispute over the ontological status of the universals (platonic Ideas): Realism asserted their existence independently of perception; conceptualism asserted their existence within the mind only; nominalism denied either, only seeing universals as names of collections of individual objects (following older speculations that they are words, \\"logoi\\"). Ren√© Descartes published La G√©om√©trie (1637), aimed at reducing geometry to algebra by means of coordinate systems, giving algebra a more foundational role (while the Greeks embedded arithmetic into geometry by identifying whole numbers with evenly spaced points on a line). Descartes' book became famous after 1649 and paved the way to infinitesimal calculus. Isaac Newton (1642‚Äì1727) in England and Leibniz (1646‚Äì1716) in Germany independently developed the infinitesimal calculus based on heuristic methods greatly efficient, but direly lacking rigorous justifications. Leibniz even went on to explicitly describe infinitesimals as actual infinitely small numbers (close to zero). Leibniz also worked on formal logic but most of his writings on it remained unpublished until 1903. The Protestant philosopher George Berkeley (1685‚Äì1753), in his campaign against the religious implications of Newtonian mechanics, wrote a pamphlet on the lack of rational justifications of infinitesimal calculus:The Analyst, A Discourse Addressed to an Infidel Mathematician \\"They are neither finite quantities, nor quantities infinitely small, nor yet nothing. May we not call them the ghosts of departed quantities?\\" Then mathematics developed very rapidly and successfully in physical applications, but with little attention to logical foundations. = 19th century = In the 19th century, mathematics became increasingly abstract. Concerns about logical gaps and inconsistencies in different fields led to the development of axiomatic systems.  Real analysis  Cauchy (1789‚Äì1857) started the project of formulating and proving the theorems of infinitesimal calculus in a rigorous manner, rejecting the heuristic principle of the generality of algebra exploited by earlier authors. In his 1821 work Cours d'Analyse he defines infinitely small quantities in terms of decreasing sequences that converge to 0, which he then used to define continuity. But he did not formalize his notion of convergence. The modern (Œµ, Œ¥)-definition of limit and continuous functions was first developed by Bolzano in 1817, but remained relatively unknown. It gives a rigorous foundation of infinitesimal calculus based on the set of real numbers, arguably resolving the Zeno paradoxes and Berkeley's arguments. Mathematicians such as Karl Weierstrass (1815‚Äì1897) discovered pathological functions such as continuous, nowhere-differentiable functions. Previous conceptions of a function as a rule for computation, or a smooth graph, were no longer adequate. Weierstrass began to advocate the arithmetization of analysis, to axiomatize analysis using properties of the natural numbers. In 1858, Dedekind proposed a definition of the real numbers as cuts of rational numbers. This reduction of real numbers and continuous functions in terms of rational numbers, and thus of natural numbers, was later integrated by Cantor in his set theory, and axiomatized in terms of second order arithmetic by Hilbert and Bernays.  Group theory  For the first time, the limits of mathematics were explored. Niels Henrik Abel (1802‚Äì1829), a Norwegian, and √âvariste Galois, (1811‚Äì1832) a Frenchman, investigated the solutions of various polynomial equations, and proved that there is no general algebraic solution to equations of degree greater than four (Abel‚ÄìRuffini theorem). With these concepts, Pierre Wantzel (1837) proved that straightedge and compass alone cannot trisect an arbitrary angle nor double a cube. In 1882, Lindemann building on the work of Hermite showed that a straightedge and compass quadrature of the circle (construction of a square equal in area to a given circle) was also impossible by proving that is a transcendental number. Mathematicians had attempted to solve all of these problems in vain since the time of the ancient Greeks. Abel and Galois's works opened the way for the developments of group theory (which would later be used to study symmetry in physics and other fields), and abstract algebra. Concepts of vector spaces emerged from the conception of barycentric coordinates by M√∂bius in 1827, to the modern definition of vector spaces and linear maps by Peano in 1888. Geometry was no more limited to three dimensions. These concepts did not generalize numbers but combined notions of functions and sets which were not yet formalized, breaking away from familiar mathematical objects.  Non- Euclidean geometries  After many failed attempts to derive the parallel postulate from other axioms, the study of the still hypothetical hyperbolic geometry by Johann Heinrich Lambert (1728‚Äì1777) led him to introduce the hyperbolic functions and compute the area of a hyperbolic triangle (where the sum of angles is less than 180¬∞). Then the Russian mathematician Nikolai Lobachevsky (1792‚Äì1856) established in 1826 (and published in 1829) the coherence of this geometry (thus the independence of the parallel postulate), in parallel with the Hungarian mathematician J√°nos Bolyai (1802‚Äì1860) in 1832, and with Gauss. Later in the 19th century, the German mathematician Bernhard Riemann developed Elliptic geometry, another non-Euclidean geometry where no parallel can be found and the sum of angles in a triangle is more than 180¬∞. It was proved consistent by defining point to mean a pair of antipodal points on a fixed sphere and line to mean a great circle on the sphere. At that time, the main method for proving the consistency of a set of axioms was to provide a model for it.  Projective geometry  One of the traps in a deductive system is circular reasoning, a problem that seemed to befall projective geometry until it was resolved by Karl von Staudt. As explained by Russian historians:Laptev, B.L. & B.A. Rozenfel'd (1996) Mathematics of the 19th Century: Geometry, page 40, Birkh√§user The purely geometric approach of von Staudt was based on the complete quadrilateral to express the relation of projective harmonic conjugates. Then he created a means of expressing the familiar numeric properties with his Algebra of Throws. English language versions of this process of deducing the properties of a field can be found in either the book by Oswald Veblen and John Young, Projective Geometry (1938), or more recently in John Stillwell's Four Pillars of Geometry (2005). Stillwell writes on page 120 The algebra of throws is commonly seen as a feature of cross-ratios since students ordinarily rely upon numbers without worry about their basis. However, cross-ratio calculations use metric features of geometry, features not admitted by purists. For instance, in 1961 Coxeter wrote Introduction to Geometry without mention of cross-ratio.  Boolean algebra and logic  Attempts of formal treatment of mathematics had started with Leibniz and Lambert (1728‚Äì1777), and continued with works by algebraists such as George Peacock (1791‚Äì1858). Systematic mathematical treatments of logic came with the British mathematician George Boole (1847) who devised an algebra that soon evolved into what is now called Boolean algebra, in which the only numbers were 0 and 1 and logical combinations (conjunction, disjunction, implication and negation) are operations similar to the addition and multiplication of integers. Additionally, De Morgan published his laws in 1847. Logic thus became a branch of mathematics. Boolean algebra is the starting point of mathematical logic and has important applications in computer science. Charles Sanders Peirce built upon the work of Boole to develop a logical system for relations and quantifiers, which he published in several papers from 1870 to 1885. The German mathematician Gottlob Frege (1848‚Äì1925) presented an independent development of logic with quantifiers in his Begriffsschrift (formula language) published in 1879, a work generally considered as marking a turning point in the history of logic. He exposed deficiencies in Aristotle's Logic, and pointed out the three expected properties of a mathematical theory # Consistency: impossibility of proving contradictory statements. # Completeness: any statement is either provable or refutable (i.e. its negation is provable). # Decidability: there is a decision procedure to test any statement in the theory. He then showed in Grundgesetze der Arithmetik (Basic Laws of Arithmetic) how arithmetic could be formalised in his new logic. Frege's work was popularized by Bertrand Russell near the turn of the century. But Frege's two-dimensional notation had no success. Popular notations were (x) for universal and (‚àÉx) for existential quantifiers, coming from Giuseppe Peano and William Ernest Johnson until the ‚àÄ symbol was introduced by Gerhard Gentzen in 1935 and became canonical in the 1960s. From 1890 to 1905, Ernst Schr√∂der published Vorlesungen √ºber die Algebra der Logik in three volumes. This work summarized and extended the work of Boole, De Morgan, and Peirce, and was a comprehensive reference to symbolic logic as it was understood at the end of the 19th century.  Peano arithmetic  The formalization of arithmetic (the theory of natural numbers) as an axiomatic theory started with Peirce in 1881 and continued with Richard Dedekind and Giuseppe Peano in 1888. This was still a second-order axiomatization (expressing induction in terms of arbitrary subsets, thus with an implicit use of set theory) as concerns for expressing theories in first-order logic were not yet understood. In Dedekind's work, this approach appears as completely characterizing natural numbers and providing recursive definitions of addition and multiplication from the successor function and mathematical induction.  Foundational crisis  The foundational crisis of mathematics (in German Grundlagenkrise der Mathematik) was the early 20th century's term for the search for proper foundations of mathematics. Several schools of the philosophy of mathematics ran into difficulties one after the other in the 20th century, as the assumption that mathematics had any foundation that could be consistently stated within mathematics itself was heavily challenged by the discovery of various paradoxes (such as Russell's paradox). The name \\"paradox\\" should not be confused with contradiction. A contradiction in a formal theory is a formal proof of an absurdity inside the theory (such as ), showing that this theory is inconsistent and must be rejected. But a paradox may be either a surprising but true result in a given formal theory, or an informal argument leading to a contradiction, so that a candidate theory, if it is to be formalized, must disallow at least one of its steps; in this case the problem is to find a satisfying theory without contradiction. Both meanings may apply if the formalized version of the argument forms the proof of a surprising truth. For instance, Russell's paradox may be expressed as \\"there is no set of all sets\\" (except in some marginal axiomatic set theories). Various schools of thought opposed each other. The leading school was that of the formalist approach, of which David Hilbert was the foremost proponent, culminating in what is known as Hilbert's program, which thought to ground mathematics on a small basis of a logical system proved sound by metamathematical finitistic means. The main opponent was the intuitionist school, led by L. E. J. Brouwer, which resolutely discarded formalism as a meaningless game with symbols.van Dalen D. (2008), \\"Brouwer, Luitzen Egbertus Jan (1881‚Äì1966)\\", in Biografisch Woordenboek van Nederland. URL:http://www.inghist.nl/Onderzoek/Projecten/BWN/lemmata/bwn2/brouwerle [2008-03-13] The fight was acrimonious. In 1920 Hilbert succeeded in having Brouwer, whom he considered a threat to mathematics, removed from the editorial board of Mathematische Annalen, the leading mathematical journal of the time. = Philosophical views = At the beginning of the 20th century, three schools of philosophy of mathematics opposed each other: Formalism, Intuitionism and Logicism. The Second Conference on the Epistemology of the Exact Sciences held in K√∂nigsberg in 1930 gave space to these three schools.  Formalism  It has been claimed that formalists, such as David Hilbert (1862-1943), hold that mathematics is only a language and a series of games. Indeed, he used the words \\"formula game\\" in his 1927 response to L. E. J. Brouwer's criticisms: Thus Hilbert is insisting that mathematics is not an arbitrary game with arbitrary rules; rather it must agree with how our thinking, and then our speaking and writing, proceeds. The foundational philosophy of formalism, as exemplified by David Hilbert, is a response to the paradoxes of set theory, and is based on formal logic. Virtually all mathematical theorems today can be formulated as theorems of set theory. The truth of a mathematical statement, in this view, is represented by the fact that the statement can be derived from the axioms of set theory using the rules of formal logic. Merely the use of formalism alone does not explain several issues: why we should use the axioms we do and not some others, why we should employ the logical rules we do and not some others, why do \\"true\\" mathematical statements (e.g., the laws of arithmetic) appear to be true, and so on. Hermann Weyl would ask these very questions of Hilbert: In some cases these questions may be sufficiently answered through the study of formal theories, in disciplines such as reverse mathematics and computational complexity theory. As noted by Weyl, formal logical systems also run the risk of inconsistency; in Peano arithmetic, this arguably has already been settled with several proofs of consistency, but there is debate over whether or not they are sufficiently finitary to be meaningful. G√∂del's second incompleteness theorem establishes that logical systems of arithmetic can never contain a valid proof of their own consistency. What Hilbert wanted to do was prove a logical system S was consistent, based on principles P that only made up a small part of S. But G√∂del proved that the principles P could not even prove P to be consistent, let alone S.  Intuitionism  Intuitionists, such as L. E. J. Brouwer (1882‚Äì1966), hold that mathematics is a creation of the human mind. Numbers, like fairy tale characters, are merely mental entities, which would not exist if there were never any human minds to think about them. The foundational philosophy of intuitionism or constructivism, as exemplified in the extreme by Brouwer and Stephen Kleene, requires proofs to be \\"constructive\\" in nature the existence of an object must be demonstrated rather than inferred from a demonstration of the impossibility of its non- existence. For example, as a consequence of this the form of proof known as reductio ad absurdum is suspect. Some modern theories in the philosophy of mathematics deny the existence of foundations in the original sense. Some theories tend to focus on mathematical practice, and aim to describe and analyze the actual working of mathematicians as a social group. Others try to create a cognitive science of mathematics, focusing on human cognition as the origin of the reliability of mathematics when applied to the real world. These theories would propose to find foundations only in human thought, not in any objective outside construct. The matter remains controversial.  Logicism  Logicism is a school of thought, and research programme, in the philosophy of mathematics, based on the thesis that mathematics is an extension of a logic or that some or all mathematics may be derived in a suitable formal system whose axioms and rules of inference are 'logical' in nature. Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead championed this theory initiated by Gottlob Frege and influenced by Richard Dedekind.  Set- theoretic Platonism  Many researchers in axiomatic set theory have subscribed to what is known as set-theoretic Platonism, exemplified by Kurt G√∂del. Several set theorists followed this approach and actively searched for axioms that may be considered as true for heuristic reasons and that would decide the continuum hypothesis. Many large cardinal axioms were studied, but the hypothesis always remained independent from them and it is now considered unlikely that CH can be resolved by a new large cardinal axiom. Other types of axioms were considered, but none of them has reached consensus on the continuum hypothesis yet. Recent work by Hamkins proposes a more flexible alternative: a set-theoretic multiverse allowing free passage between set- theoretic universes that satisfy the continuum hypothesis and other universes that do not.  Indispensability argument for realism  This argument by Willard Quine and Hilary Putnam says (in Putnam's shorter words), However, Putnam was not a Platonist.  Rough-and-ready realism  Few mathematicians are typically concerned on a daily, working basis over logicism, formalism or any other philosophical position. Instead, their primary concern is that the mathematical enterprise as a whole always remains productive. Typically, they see this as ensured by remaining open-minded, practical and busy; as potentially threatened by becoming overly-ideological, fanatically reductionistic or lazy. Such a view has also been expressed by some well-known physicists. For example, the Physics Nobel Prize laureate Richard Feynman said And Steven Weinberg:Steven Weinberg, chapter Against Philosophy wrote, in Dreams of a final theory Weinberg believed that any undecidability in mathematics, such as the continuum hypothesis, could be potentially resolved despite the incompleteness theorem, by finding suitable further axioms to add to set theory.  Philosophical consequences of G√∂del's completeness theorem  G√∂del's completeness theorem establishes an equivalence in first-order logic between the formal provability of a formula and its truth in all possible models. Precisely, for any consistent first- order theory it gives an \\"explicit construction\\" of a model described by the theory; this model will be countable if the language of the theory is countable. However this \\"explicit construction\\" is not algorithmic. It is based on an iterative process of completion of the theory, where each step of the iteration consists in adding a formula to the axioms if it keeps the theory consistent; but this consistency question is only semi-decidable (an algorithm is available to find any contradiction but if there is none this consistency fact can remain unprovable). This can be seen as a giving a sort of justification to the Platonist view that the objects of our mathematical theories are real. More precisely, it shows that the mere assumption of the existence of the set of natural numbers as a totality (an actual infinity) suffices to imply the existence of a model (a world of objects) of any consistent theory. However several difficulties remain: * For any consistent theory this usually does not give just one world of objects, but an infinity of possible worlds that the theory might equally describe, with a possible diversity of truths between them. * In the case of set theory, none of the models obtained by this construction resemble the intended model, as they are countable while set theory intends to describe uncountable infinities. Similar remarks can be made in many other cases. For example, with theories that include arithmetic, such constructions generally give models that include non- standard numbers, unless the construction method was specifically designed to avoid them. * As it gives models to all consistent theories without distinction, it gives no reason to accept or reject any axiom as long as the theory remains consistent, but regards all consistent axiomatic theories as referring to equally existing worlds. It gives no indication on which axiomatic system should be preferred as a foundation of mathematics. * As claims of consistency are usually unprovable, they remain a matter of belief or non-rigorous kinds of justifications. Hence the existence of models as given by the completeness theorem needs in fact two philosophical assumptions: the actual infinity of natural numbers and the consistency of the theory. Another consequence of the completeness theorem is that it justifies the conception of infinitesimals as actual infinitely small nonzero quantities, based on the existence of non-standard models as equally legitimate to standard ones. This idea was formalized by Abraham Robinson into the theory of nonstandard analysis. = More paradoxes = *1920: Thoralf Skolem corrected Leopold L√∂wenheim's proof of what is now called the downward L√∂wenheim‚ÄìSkolem theorem, leading to Skolem's paradox discussed in 1922, namely the existence of countable models of ZF, making infinite cardinalities a relative property. *1922: Proof by Abraham Fraenkel that the axiom of choice cannot be proved from the axioms of Zermelo set theory with urelements. *1931: Publication of G√∂del's incompleteness theorems, showing that essential aspects of Hilbert's program could not be attained. It showed how to construct, for any sufficiently powerful and consistent recursively axiomatizable system such as necessary to axiomatize the elementary theory of arithmetic on the (infinite) set of natural numbers a statement that formally expresses its own unprovability, which he then proved equivalent to the claim of consistency of the theory; so that (assuming the consistency as true), the system is not powerful enough for proving its own consistency, let alone that a simpler system could do the job. It thus became clear that the notion of mathematical truth can not be completely determined and reduced to a purely formal system as envisaged in Hilbert's program. This dealt a final blow to the heart of Hilbert's program, the hope that consistency could be established by finitistic means (it was never made clear exactly what axioms were the \\"finitistic\\" ones, but whatever axiomatic system was being referred to, it was a 'weaker' system than the system whose consistency it was supposed to prove). *1936: Alfred Tarski proved his truth undefinability theorem. *1936: Alan Turing proved that a general algorithm to solve the halting problem for all possible program-input pairs cannot exist. *1938: G√∂del proved the consistency of the axiom of choice and of the generalized continuum hypothesis. *1936‚Äì1937: Alonzo Church and Alan Turing, respectively, published independent papers showing that a general solution to the Entscheidungsproblem is impossible: the universal validity of statements in first-order logic is not decidable (it is only semi-decidable as given by the completeness theorem). *1955: Pyotr Novikov showed that there exists a finitely presented group G such that the word problem for G is undecidable. *1963: Paul Cohen showed that the Continuum Hypothesis is unprovable from ZFC. Cohen's proof developed the method of forcing, which is now an important tool for establishing independence results in set theory. *1964: Inspired by the fundamental randomness in physics, Gregory Chaitin starts publishing results on algorithmic information theory (measuring incompleteness and randomness in mathematics). *1966: Paul Cohen showed that the axiom of choice is unprovable in ZF even without urelements. *1970: Hilbert's tenth problem is proven unsolvable: there is no recursive solution to decide whether a Diophantine equation (multivariable polynomial equation) has a solution in integers. *1971: Suslin's problem is proven to be independent from ZFC.  Partial resolution of the crisis  Starting in 1935, the Bourbaki group of French mathematicians started publishing a series of books to formalize many areas of mathematics on the new foundation of set theory. The intuitionistic school did not attract many adherents, and it was not until Bishop's work in 1967 that constructive mathematics was placed on a sounder footing. One may consider that Hilbert's program has been partially completed, so that the crisis is essentially resolved, satisfying ourselves with lower requirements than Hilbert's original ambitions. His ambitions were expressed in a time when nothing was clear: it was not clear whether mathematics could have a rigorous foundation at all. There are many possible variants of set theory, which differ in consistency strength, where stronger versions (postulating higher types of infinities) contain formal proofs of the consistency of weaker versions, but none contains a formal proof of its own consistency. Thus the only thing we don't have is a formal proof of consistency of whatever version of set theory we may prefer, such as ZF. In practice, most mathematicians either do not work from axiomatic systems, or if they do, do not doubt the consistency of ZFC, generally their preferred axiomatic system. In most of mathematics as it is practiced, the incompleteness and paradoxes of the underlying formal theories never played a role anyway, and in those branches in which they do or whose formalization attempts would run the risk of forming inconsistent theories (such as logic and category theory), they may be treated carefully. The development of category theory in the middle of the 20th century showed the usefulness of set theories guaranteeing the existence of larger classes than does ZFC, such as Von Neumann‚ÄìBernays‚ÄìG√∂del set theory or Tarski‚ÄìGrothendieck set theory, albeit that in very many cases the use of large cardinal axioms or Grothendieck universes is formally eliminable. One goal of the reverse mathematics program is to identify whether there are areas of \\"core mathematics\\" in which foundational issues may again provoke a crisis.

Palau was the last Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands territories to gain its independence. Under the Compact, the U.S. remains responsible for Palau's defense for 50 years. Palau is a sovereign nation and conducts its own foreign relations. From its independence until July 2019, Palau had established diplomatic relations with over 80 sovereign countries.http://www.doi.gov/oia/islands/upload/PalauDipRelations.pdf Since then, it has established bilateral relations with over 10 other nations, raising the current number of diplomatic partners of Palau to over 50. Palau was admitted to the United Nations on December 15, 1994, and has since joined several other international organizations. In 2004, Stuart Beck was appointed to serve as Palau's first permanent representative to the United Nations. Along with the other former Trust Territories, Palau is one of a handful of countries that regularly votes with Israel in the United Nations General Assembly.

Its most significant product was the multi-platform network operating system known as Novell NetWare, which became the dominant form of personal computer networking during the second half of the 1980s and first half of the 1990s. At its high point, NetWare had a 63 percent share of the market for network operating systems, and by the early 1990s there were over half a million NetWare-based networks installed worldwide. Novell technology contributed to the emergence of local area networks, which displaced the dominant mainframe computing model and changed computing worldwide. Novell became instrumental in making Utah Valley a focus for technology and software development. Under the leadership of Ray Noorda, during the early- to mid-1990s Novell attempted to compete directly with Microsoft by acquiring Digital Research, Unix System Laboratories, WordPerfect, and the Quattro Pro division of Borland. These moves did not work out, and NetWare began losing market share once Microsoft bundled network services with the Windows NT operating system and its successors. Despite new products such as Novell Directory Services and GroupWise, Novell entered a long period of decline. Eventually Novell acquired SUSE Linux and attempted to refocus its technology base. The company was an independent corporate entity until it was acquired as a wholly owned subsidiary by The Attachmate Group in 2011, which in turn was acquired in 2014 by Micro Focus International. Novell products and technologies are now integrated within various Micro Focus divisions.  History = Origins as a hardware company = Novell's chief scientist was Drew Major, here seen later in his career The company began in 1979 in Orem, Utah as Novell Data Systems Inc. (NDSI), a hardware manufacturer producing CP/M-based systems. Former Eyring Research Institute (ERI) employee Dennis Fairclough was a member of the original team. It was co-founded by George Canova, Darin Field, and Jack Davis. Victor V. Vurpillat brought the deal to Pete Musser, chairman of the board of Safeguard Scientifics, Inc., who provided the seed funding. The company initially did not do well. The microcomputer produced by the company was comparatively weak against performance by competitors. In order to compete on systems sales Novell Data Systems planned a program to link more than one microcomputer to operate together. The former ERI employees Drew Major, Dale Neibaur and Kyle Powell, known as the SuperSet Software group, were hired to this task. At ERI, Fairclough, Major, Neibaur and Powell had worked on government contracts for the Intelligent Systems Technology Project, and thereby gained an important insight into the ARPANET and related technologies, ideas which would become crucial to the foundation of Novell. Novell retained some hardware products even after NetWare became a success; here, a Novell NE2000 16-bit ISA 10Base-2 Ethernet card from 1990 The Safeguard board then ordered Musser to shut Novell down. Musser contacted two Safeguard investors and investment bankers, Barry Rubenstein and Fred Dolin, who guaranteed to raise the necessary funds to continue the business as a software company as Novell Data Systems' networking program could work on computers from other companies. Davis left Novell Data Systems in November 1981, followed by Canova in March 1982. Rubinstein and Dolin, along with Jack Messman, interviewed and hired Raymond Noorda. The required funding was obtained through a rights offering to Safeguard shareholders, managed by the Cleveland brokerage house, Prescott, Ball and Turben, and guaranteed by Rubenstein and Dolin. Major, Neibaur and Powell continued to support Novell through their SuperSet Software Group. In January 1983, the company's name was shortened to \\"Novell, Inc.\\", and Noorda became the head of the firm. Later that same year, the company introduced its most significant product, the multi-platform network operating system (NOS), Novell NetWare. = NetWare = Floppy disks for NetWare 2.2 The annual Novell BrainShare conference, here with its entrance letters in 1995, helped spread the word about how developers and partners could make use of NetWare Novell's Building F in Provo in 1994, part of a large complex of Novell buildings once there, with the Wasatch Range in the background The first Novell product was a proprietary hardware server based on the Motorola 68000 CPU supporting six MUX ports per board for a maximum of four boards per server using a star topology with twisted pair cabling. A network interface card (NIC) was developed for the IBM PC industry standard architecture (ISA) bus. The server was using the first network operating system (NOS) called ShareNet (aka S-Net). Later, ShareNet was ported to run on the Intel platform and renamed NetWare. The first commercial release of NetWare was version 1.5. Novell based its network protocol on Xerox Network Systems (XNS), and created its own standards from IDP and SPP, which it named Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX) and Sequenced Packet Exchange (SPX). File and print services ran on the NetWare Core Protocol (NCP) over IPX, as did Routing Information Protocol (RIP) and Service Advertising Protocol (SAP). Novell had acquired Kanwal Rekhi's company Excelan in 1989, which manufactured smart Ethernet cards and commercialized the Internet protocol TCP/IP, solidifying Novell's presence in these niche areas. Novell did extremely well throughout the 1980s. It aggressively expanded its market share by selling its expensive Ethernet cards at cost. By 1990, Novell had an almost monopolistic position in NOS for any business requiring a network. With this market leadership, Novell began to acquire and build services on top of its NetWare operating platform. These services extended NetWare's capabilities with such products as NetWare for SAA, Novell multi- protocol router, GroupWise and BorderManager. =Beyond NetWare= However, Novell was also diversifying, moving away from its smaller users to target large corporations, although the company later attempted to refocus with NetWare for Small Business. It reduced investment in research and was slow to improve the product administration tools, although it was helped by the fact its products typically needed little \\"tweaking\\" ‚Äî they just ran. Under Noorda, Novell made a series of acquisitions interpreted by many to be a challenge to Microsoft. Novell acquired Digital Research for in June 1991. NetWare used DR DOS as a boot loader and maintenance platform, and Novell intended to extend its desktop presence by integrating networking into DR DOS and providing an alternative to Microsoft's Windows. At first, the idea was to provide a graphical environment based on Digital Research's GEM, but Novell's legal department rejected this due to apprehension of a possible legal response from Apple, so the company went directly to Apple starting Star Trek in February 1992, a project to run an x86-port of their Mac OS on top of a multitasking DR DOS. Novell's Summit, New Jersey, office, 1994 (formerly Unix System Laboratories) On the server side, after their initial October 1991 Univel initiative Novell bought Unix System Laboratories (USL) from AT&T; Corporation in 1993, acquiring rights to the Unix operating system for their UnixWare. One of Novell's major innovations at the time was Novell Directory Services (NDS), now known as eDirectory. Introduced with NetWare 4.0 in 1993, NDS replaced the old Bindery server and user management technology employed by NetWare 3.x and earlier. In 1994 Novell announced plans to develop a SuperNOS based on NetWare 4.1 and UnixWare 2.0. The WordPerfect building in Orem, Utah, with Novell signage, in 1994 Novell's PerfectOffice suite, reflecting the purchases of WordPerfect and Quattro Pro as well as some components Novell developed itself In 1994, Novell also bought WordPerfect Corporation, as well as acquiring Quattro Pro from Borland. As Novell faced new competition, Noorda was replaced by Robert Frankenberg in April 1994. The Noorda-era acquisitions were short- lived: Novell had already abandoned Digital Research's Multiuser DOS in 1992. The three former Master Value Added Resellers (VARs) DataPac Australasia, Concurrent Controls and Intelligent Micro Software could license the source code to take over and continue independent development of their derivations in 1994. Digital Research's FlexOS had been licensed to IBM for their 4690 OS in 1993 and was also utilized for the in-house development of Novell's Embedded Systems Technology (NEST), but was sold off to Integrated Systems, Inc. (ISI) for in July 1994. The deal comprised a direct payment of half this sum as well as shares representing 2% of the company. Novell also abandoned their Corsair desktop project and in late 1994 transferred some components to Caldera, a startup funded by Noorda's Canopy Group. In 1995, Novell assigned portions of its Unix business to the Santa Cruz Operation. WordPerfect and Quattro Pro were sold to Corel in January 1996. Novell DOS (and all former DR DOS versions including StarTrek, PalmDOS and DOS Plus) as well as other remaining Digital Research assets (like GEM and the CP/M- and MP/M-based operating systems, programming languages, tools and technologies) were sold to Caldera on 23 July 1996. Personal NetWare had been abandoned at Novell in 1995 but was licensed to Caldera in binary form only. The deal consisted of a direct payment of US$400,000 as well as percentual royalties for any revenues derived from those assets to Novell. In January 1997, Novell's NEST initiative was abandoned as well. In 1996, the company began a move into Internet-enabled products, replacing reliance on the proprietary IPX protocol in favor of a native TCP/IP stack. The move was accelerated when Eric Schmidt became CEO in 1997, succeeding Frankenberg, who had resigned the previous year; Christopher Stone was brought in as senior vice president of strategy and corporate development, reporting to Schmidt. The result was NetWare 5.0, released in October 1998, which leveraged and built upon eDirectory and introduced new functions, such as Novell Cluster Services (NCS, a replacement for SFT-III) and Novell Storage Services (NSS), a replacement for the traditional Turbo FAT filesystem used by earlier versions of NetWare. While NetWare 5.0 introduced native TCP/IP support into the NOS, IPX was still supported, allowing for smooth transitions between environments and avoiding the \\"forklift upgrades\\" frequently required by competing environments. Similarly, the traditional Turbo FAT file system remained a supported option. =Decline= The inclusion of networking as a core system component in all mainstream PC operating systems after 1995 led to a steep decline in Novell's market share. Unlike Windows 3.1 and its predecessors, Windows 95, Linux, and OS/2 all included network functionality which greatly reduced demand for third-party products in this segment. Eric Schmidt, CEO of Novell from 1997 to 2001 Novell's decline and loss of market share accelerated under Eric Schmidt's leadership, with Novell experiencing an across-the-board decline in sales and purchases of NetWare and a drop in share price from /share to /share. Analysts commented that the primary reason for Novell's demise was linked to its channel strategy and mismanagement of channel partners under Schmidt. Under Ray Noorda's leadership, Novell provided upgrades to resellers and customers in the same packaging as a newly purchased copy of NetWare, but at one third the cost, which created a \\"gray market\\" that allowed NetWare resellers to sell upgrades as newly purchased NetWare versions at full price periodically, which Novell intentionally did not track. Ray Noorda commented to several analysts that he devised this strategy to allow front line resellers to \\"punch through\\" the distributors like Tech Data and Ingram and acquire NetWare versions at a discounted rate, as Novell \\"looked the other way\\"; this helped fund the salaries of Novell Field Support Technicians, who for the most part were employees who worked for the front line resellers as Novell CNE (Certified NetWare Engineers). Noorda commented that this strategy was one he learned as an executive at General Electric when competing against imported home appliances: allow the resellers to \\"make more money off your product than someone else's\\". Eric Schmidt embarked on a disastrous strategy to remove the upgrades as whole box products without understanding Novell's channel dynamics, then directed Novell's general counsel to initiate litigation against a large number of Novell resellers who were routinely selling upgrades as newly purchased NetWare versions. Although this move bolstered Novell's revenue numbers for several quarters, Novell's channels subsequently collapsed with the majority of Novell's resellers dropping NetWare for fear of litigation. Novell had a development office in Bracknell, Berkshire, UK for many years (here seen in 2006) By 1999, Novell had lost its dominant market position, and was continually being out-marketed by Microsoft as resellers dropped NetWare, allowing Microsoft to gain access to corporate data centers by bypassing technical staff and selling directly to corporate executives. Most resellers then re-certified their Novell CNE employees‚Äî the field support technicians who were Novell's primary contact in the field with direct customers‚Äîas Microsoft MCSE technicians, and were encouraged to position NetWare as inferior to Windows 2000 features such as Group Policy and Microsoft's GUI, which was considered to be more modern than the character-based Novell interfaces. With falling revenue, the company focused on net services and platform interoperability. Products such as eDirectory and GroupWise were made multi-platform. In October 2000, Novell released a new product, dubbed \\"DirXML\\", which was designed to synchronize data‚Äîtypically user information‚Äîbetween disparate directory and database systems. This product leveraged the speed and functionality of eDirectory to store information, and would later become the Novell Identity Manager, forming the foundation of a core product set within Novell. = Cambridge Technology Partners = In the early 2000s Novell moved its headquarters to this building in Waltham, Massachusetts, following the acquisition of Cambridge Technology Partners In July 2001, Novell acquired the consulting company Cambridge Technology Partners (CTP), founded in Cambridge, Massachusetts by John J. Donovan, to expand offerings into services. Novell felt that the ability to offer solutions (a combination of software and services) was key to satisfying customer demand. The merger was apparently against the firm's software development culture, and the finance personnel at the firm also recommended against it. The CEO of CTP, Jack Messman, engineered the merger using his position as a board member of Novell since its inception, and as part of the deal became CEO of Novell. Chris Stone, who had left in 1999, was rehired as vice chairman to set the course for Novell's strategy into open source and enterprise Linux. With the acquisition of CTP, Novell moved its headquarters to Massachusetts. In July 2002, Novell acquired SilverStream Software, a leader in web services-oriented applications, but a laggard in the marketplace. Renamed to Novell exteNd, the platform comprised XML and web service tools based on Java EE. = Linux = SuSE Linux headquarters and Novell office in Nuremberg in 2007 In August 2003, Novell acquired Ximian, a developer of open source Linux applications (Evolution, Red Carpet and Mono). This acquisition signaled Novell's plans to move its collective product set onto a Linux kernel. In November 2003, Novell acquired Linux OS developer SuSE, which led to a major shift of power in Linux distributions. IBM also invested to show support of the SuSE acquisition. In mid-2003, Novell released \\"Novell Enterprise Linux Services\\" (NNLS), which ported some of the services traditionally associated with NetWare to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) version 8. In November 2004, Novell released the Linux-based enterprise desktop Novell Linux Desktop 9, based on Ximian Desktop and SUSE Linux Professional 9.1. This was Novell's first attempt to get into the enterprise desktop market. The successor product to NetWare, Open Enterprise Server, was released in March 2005. OES offers all the services previously hosted by NetWare 6.5, and added the choice of delivering those services using either a NetWare 6.5 or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 9 kernel. The release was aimed to persuade NetWare customers to move to Linux. In August 2005, Novell created the openSUSE project, based on SUSE Professional. openSUSE can be downloaded freely and is also available as boxed retail product. = Stagnation = Novell with SuSE at the Invex expo in Brno, Czech Republic in 2006 From 2003 through 2005 Novell released many products across its portfolio, with the intention of arresting falling market share and to move away from dependencies on other Novell products, but the launches were not as successful as Novell had hoped. In late 2004, Chris Stone again left the company, after an apparent control issue with then CEO Jack Messman. In an effort to cut costs, Novell announced a round of layoffs in late 2005. While revenue from its Linux business continued to grow, the growth was not fast enough to offset the decrease in revenue of NetWare. While the company's revenue was not falling rapidly, it wasn't growing, either. Lack of clear direction or effective management meant that Novell took longer than expected to complete its restructuring. In June 2006, chief executive Jack Messman and chief finance officer Joseph Tibbetts were fired, with Ronald Hovsepian, Novell's president and chief operating officer, appointed chief executive, and Dana Russell, vice-president of finance and corporate controller, appointed interim CFO. = \\"Your Linux is Ready\\" = Novell's booth at a 2007 event in Beijing, showing slogan In August 2006, Novell released the SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 (SLE 10) series. SUSE Linux Enterprise Server was the first enterprise class Linux server to offer virtualization based on the Xen hypervisor. SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop (popularly known as SLED) featured a new user-friendly GUI and XGL-based 3D display capabilities. The release of SLE 10 was marketed with the phrase \\"Your Linux is Ready\\", meant to convey that Novell's Linux offerings were ready for the enterprise. In late September 2006 Novell announced a real-time version of SLES called \\"SUSE Linux Enterprise Real Time\\" (SLERT), based on technology from Concurrent Computer Corporation. =Agreement with Microsoft= In 2004, Novell sued Microsoft, asserting it had engaged in antitrust violations regarding Novell's WordPerfect business in 1994 through 1996. Novell's lawsuit was subsequently dismissed by the United States District Court in July 2012 after it concluded that the claims were without merit. On 2 November 2006, the two companies announced a joint collaboration agreement, including coverage of their respective products for each other's customers. They also promised to work more closely to improve compatibility of software, setting up a joint research facility. Executives of both companies expressed the hope that such cooperation would lead to better compatibility between Microsoft Office and OpenOffice.org and better virtualization techniques. Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said of the deal, \\"This set of agreements will really help bridge the divide between open-source and proprietary source software.\\" The deal involved upfront payment of from Microsoft to Novell for patent cooperation and SLES subscription. Additionally, Microsoft agreed to spend around yearly, over the next 5 years, for marketing and selling a combined SLES/Windows Server offering and related virtualization solutions, while Novell paid at least yearly to Microsoft, in the same period. One of the first results of this partnership was Novell adapting the OpenXML/ODF Translator for use in OpenOffice.org. Microsoft released two public covenants not to sue users of the open source Moonlight runtime‚Äîa workalike for the Microsoft Silverlight rich media platform‚Äîfor patent infringement. One condition common to each covenant was that no Moonlight implementation be released under the GPLv3 free software license. Reaction of FLOSS community Despite controversy with some in the community, Novell persisted: its booth at Solutions Linux 2009 in Paris. Initial reaction from members of the FOSS community over the patent protection was mostly critical, with expressions of concern that Novell had \\"sold out\\" and doubt that the GNU GPL would allow distribution of code, including the Linux kernel, under this exclusive agreement. In a letter to the FOSS development community on 9 November 2006, Bradley M. Kuhn, CTO of the Software Freedom Law Center (SFLC), described the agreement as \\"worse than useless\\". In a separate development, the chairman of the SFLC, Eben Moglen, reported that Novell had offered cooperation with the SFLC to permit a confidential audit to determine the compliance of the agreement with the GPL (version 2). Richard Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation, said in November 2006 that changes coming with version 3 of the GPL would preclude such deals. When the final revision of the third version of the GPL license was decided, the deal between Microsoft and Novell was grandfathered in. A clause within GPLv3 allows companies to distribute GPLv3 software even if they have made such patent partnerships in the past, as long as the partnership deal was made before 28 March 2007 (GPLv3 Section 11 paragraph 7). On 12 November 2006, the Samba team expressed strong disapproval of the announcement and asked Novell to reconsider. The team included an employee of Novell, Jeremy Allison, who confirmed in a comment on Slashdot that the statement was agreed on by all members of the team, and later quit his job at Novell in protest. In early February 2007, Reuters reported that the Free Software Foundation had announced that it was reviewing Novell's right to sell Linux versions, and was considering banning Novell from selling Linux. However, spokesman Eben Moglen later said that he was quoted out of context, and was only noting that GPL version 3 would be designed to block similar deals in the future. = Intelligent workload management = In December 2009, Novell announced its intention to lead the market in intelligent workload management, with products designed to manage diverse workloads in a heterogeneous data center. = Acquisition by The Attachmate Group= The main building in Provo in 2013 during the Attachmate Group era; the name Novell was kept on it. A 'For Sale' sign for some of the property can be seen in front of the building. Novell had long been rumored to be a target for acquisition by a variety of other companies. In March 2010, Elliott Associates, L.P., an institutional investor with approximately 8.5% stock ownership of Novell, offered to acquire the company for per share in cash, or . The company declined the offer, saying that the proposal was inadequate and that it undervalued the company's franchise and growth prospects. Novell announced in November 2010 that it had agreed to be acquired by The Attachmate Group for , and planned to operate Novell as two units, one being SUSE. As part of the deal, 882 patents owned by Novell were sold to CPTN Holdings LLC, a consortium of companies led by Microsoft and including Apple, EMC, and Oracle. According to Novell's SEC filing, the patents \\"relate primarily to enterprise-level computer systems management software, enterprise-level file management and collaboration software in addition to patents relevant to our identity and security management business, although it is possible that certain of such issued patents and patent applications read on a range of different software products\\". The Attachmate Group expressed in advance of the deal closing that there would no change to the relationship between the SUSE business and the openSUSE project. The merger completed in April 2011, with per share in cash being paid to acquire Novell. Novell became a wholly owned subsidiary of The Attachmate Group. Concurrent with the closing of the acquisition, some of Novell's products and brands were transferred to another of the Attachmate Group business units, NetIQ, and the SUSE Linux brand was spun off as its own business unit. The fourth business unit, Attachmate, was not directly affected by the acquisition. CPTN Holdings agreement Immediately prior to merger being finalized, Novell completed the patent sale to CPTN Holdings for . The U.S. Department of Justice announced that, as originally proposed, the deal with CPTN would jeopardize the ability of open source software, such as Linux, to continue to innovate and compete in the development and distribution of server, desktop, and mobile operating systems, middleware, and virtualization products; to address the department's antitrust concerns, CPTN and its owners had altered their original agreement: * All of the Novell patents would be acquired subject to the GPLv2 open source license, and the Open Invention Network (OIN) license * CPTN does not have the right to limit which of the patents, if any, are available under the OIN license * Neither CPTN nor its owners will make any statement or take any action with the purpose of influencing or encouraging either Novell or Attachmate Group to modify which of the patents are available under the OIN license =2011 layoffs= In April 2011, The Attachmate Group announced layoffs for the Novell workforce, including hundreds of employees from their Provo Utah Valley center, raising questions about the future of some open source projects such as Mono. =Micro Focus acquisition= In September 2014, mainframe software company Micro Focus announced it was buying The Attachmate Group, including Novell, for .

Dare appeared in the Eagle comic story Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future from 1950 to 1967 (and subsequently in reprints), and dramatised seven times a week on Radio Luxembourg (1951‚Äì1956). The stories were set in the late 1990s, but the dialogue and manner of the characters is reminiscent of British war films of the 1950s. Dan Dare has been described as \\"Biggles in Space\\" and as the British equivalent of Buck Rogers. Dan Dare was distinguished by its long, complex storylines, snappy dialogue and meticulously illustrated comic-strip artwork by Hampson and other artists, including Harold Johns, Don Harley, Bruce Cornwell, Greta Tomlinson, Frank Bellamy and Keith Watson. Dan Dare returned in new strips in 2000 AD in 1977 until 1979 and in the relaunched Eagle in 1982 until 1994. The most recent mainstream story was a Dan Dare mini-series published by Virgin Comics in 2007 and 2008. It was written by Garth Ennis and illustrated by Gary Erskine and is a completely new and somewhat darker interpretation of Dan Dare. Since October 2003, however, Dare's adventures have also continued in Spaceship Away, a mail-order magazine created by Rod Barzilay. Its mission statement is to continue the original Dare's adventures where the original Eagle left off, in a style as close to that of the classic strip as possible. To that end, Barzilay originally hired former Eagle artist Keith Watson, and following Watson's death Don Harley, both of whom had drawn Dare in the 1960s, to work on the strips which are written very much in the style of the Fifties stories. Publication history=Eagle= Dan Dare appeared on the cover of the first issue of the weekly comic strip magazine, Eagle, on 14 April 1950. There were two large colour pages of his story per issue. The artwork was of a high quality, the product of artists in a studio called the Old Bakehouse in Churchtown, Southport, Lancashire. The Eagle's founder, the Rev John Marcus Harston Morris, was vicar of the Southport church of St James at the time. It had scale models of spaceships, and models in costume as reference for the artists. Occasionally, Eagle incorporated \\"centrefolds\\" of the fictional spaceships, such as Dan's ship the Anastasia, reminiscent of cutaway drawings of aircraft in aviation magazines or even in Eagle itself. The storylines were long and complex, sometimes lasting more than a year. Later, artwork was produced at a studio in Hampson's house in Epsom, Surrey, where his production line techniques were continued. Attention was paid to scientific plausibility, the promising young writer Arthur C. Clarke (later a science fiction luminary) acting as science and plot adviser for the first six months of strips. The stories were set mostly on planets of the Solar System presumed to have extraterrestrial life and alien inhabitants, common in science fiction before space probes of the 1960s proved the most likely worlds were lifeless. The first story begins with Dan Dare as pilot of the first successful flight to Venus. Hampson's working habits twice caused him to suffer serious breakdowns in health, leaving his assistants to continue the series. The first occurred after two episodes of \\"Marooned on Mercury\\" (1952), which was taken over by Harold Johns, from scripts by Samaritans founder and clergyman Rev. Chad Varah, who had known Marcus Morris in Southport. Hampson returned to start the following story, \\"Operation Saturn\\" (1953), but suffered a relapse after 20 weeks. Principal art was taken over by new chief assistant Don Harley, who completed the story and its successor, \\"Prisoners of Space\\" (the only series to feature extensive work by an artist outside the studio, finishes being provided by Desmond Walduck. Hampson returned full-time in 1955, starting \\"The Man from Nowhere\\" trilogy, which took Dan and his companions outside the Solar System for the first time. The quality of the strip and its popularity remained high throughout the 1950s. In the late fifties Eagle's new owners objected to the cost of the studio and the complexity of the stories. The conflict caused Hampson to leave the strip in 1959, in the middle of a long plot that saw Dan searching an alien planet for his long-lost father. Production fell to Frank Bellamy, whose modern three-dimensional style contrasted with Hampson's, despite efforts to smooth the transition by alternating the two pages of the weekly strip between Bellamy and the team of Don Harley and Keith Watson, and freelance artist Bruce Cornwell. Characters Dan Dare was surrounded by a varying cast, initially: * Dan Dare (full name Colonel Daniel McGregor Dare) was chief pilot of the Interplanet Space Fleet. He was born in Manchester, England, in 1967 and educated at Rossall School. Although not a super-hero, he sometimes pulled off exceptional piloting and often proved extraordinarily lucky. He excelled at jujutsu, but he most often found non-violent solutions to predicaments. He was bound by a sense of honour, never lied, and would rather die than break his word. :His lean-faced character was recognisable by the outer tips of his eyebrows, which were wavy. His uniform looked like a typical British Army type (Frank Hampson used his own World War II army uniform as a model), though a lighter green. In place of British rank insignia it had coloured stripes and circles on the shoulderboards. His cap badge was a vertical, antique rocketship in a circle with one five-pointed star on either side. Initially, Dare had been intended to be portrayed as a chaplain. * Digby (Albert Fitzwilliam Digby) was Dan's Wigan-born batman. Rotund and sometimes bumbling, he provided comic relief. He was fiercely loyal and the only character apart from Dan to appear in every story. His favourite recreation was sleeping and he was fond of traditional English food. His nearest relative was his Aunt Anastasia, after whom Dan named his spaceship. * Sir Hubert Guest, Controller of the Space Fleet, sent Dan on missions, and occasionally joined him. He was a veteran pilot, having been on the first mission to the Moon and led the first mission to Mars. He was based on Hampson's father. * Professor Peabody (Prof. Jocelyn Mabel Peabody), the only major female, was the brains behind many of the team's most inventive plans. * Hank Hogan and Pierre Lafayette, stereotypically American and French, were two of the Fleet's best pilots and an inseparable double-act. Pierre was primarily a pilot, Hank more a mechanic. * Sondar was a Treen, a reptilian inhabitant of northern Venus. Originally a servant of the Mekon, he reformed after Dan spared his life during a traumatic episode that also caused his first experience of strong emotion, which the Treens suppressed. He became governor of northern Venus when the planet was placed under UN rule at the end of the first story, but nevertheless joined Dan on later adventures. He was also a talented spacecraft designer, and designed Dan's personal spaceship. * The Mekon, super-intelligent ruler of the Treens, was Dan's archenemy. He escaped at the end of each story to return with an even more inventive scheme for the conquest of Earth. * Christopher 'Flamer' Spry, freckle-faced student at 'Astral' space academy, who accompanies Dan Dare on many later missions. Flamer was based on Hampson's son, Peter Hampson.Dan Dare 'inspired UK innovation' BBC News * Lex O'Malley, bearded Irish submarine commander, who accompanies Dan Dare on later missions. With the exception of Digby, all the supporting cast were dropped after 1961, although Guest, O'Malley, Hogan and Sondar made occasional reappearances. In 1963, Keith Watson and writer David Motton were allowed to introduce a new supporting cast, who remained with the series throughout the rest of its run. *Colonel Wilf Banger, handlebar moustache, pilot and designer, an impulsive and volatile character. Banger designed and built the Tempus Frangit. *Technician Nutter Cobb, red-haired, broken-nosed. Banger's assistant, a Digby to his Dare. *Major Shillitoe Spence, balding, pencil moustache. A prim, fussy administrator. *Xel, first encountered in Operation Time Trap in 1963. Xel is another enemy in the mould of the Mekon. Having stowed away with Dare at the end of his first appearance, in the next story Xel allies with the Mekon but the two fall out. Xel would make regular appearances through the 60s before being finally captured. Vehicles Spacecraft of various designs were presented as the product of inhabitants of various planets. The vehicle most identified with Dan was the winged Anastasia. Designed by Sondar, it employed both Venusian and Earth space drives. Later, an alien ship was adopted and renamed the Zyl-bat. There was also an experimental time-travelling ship called Tempus Frangit (Latin: it breaks time or time breaks). There were land and air vehicles ‚Äì in the first stories, cars conform to styling of the time, while some flying machines were based on the design of helicopters of the mid-twentieth century. Also of note was Lex O'Malley's ship, the Poseidon, a versatile craft that could operate as a jetfoil as well as a submarine. London Transport used overhead monorails and helibuses in early stories. Ground transport cars were also drawn with gyroscopes and single wheels. Venusian vehicles were depicted as being technologically more advanced than those of Earth. South of the Flamebelt the Therons had applied their technology to peaceful agricultural purposes including dedicated agricultural land and flying machines. North of the Flamebelt the Treens perfected low friction/low energy consumption means of transport including vacuum tube transport (Electrosenders) for long distance travel. Spaceports There is evidence that the Spacefleet spaceport on Earth is west of Formby in Lancashire on a semicircle of land built into the Irish Sea by landfill. Spacesuits Spacefleet spacesuits had a corselet plate like on Siebe Gorman standard diving suits. Their suit had no life- support backpack; the life-support gear was between two layers of the helmet. All or most Dan Dare comic pictures were drawn from models or posed humans. As a result, the Spacefleet spacesuits in space hang in folds like the boilersuit in which the models posed and show no sign of gas pressure. After the first Venus war, Spacefleet spacesuits had propulsor backpacks copied from a Treen or Theron design. Some other spacesuits such as Blasco's have life-support backpacks. The 1960s In 1960 artwork was taken over by Frank Bellamy, Don Harley, Keith Watson, Gerald Palmer, with Bruce Cornwell, and the look changed, with the colourful, rounded rocket ships replaced by angular silver craft, and changes to the space suits and insignia. The changes were never wholeheartedly taken up, however, and the look was erratic from then on. In 1962 the strip was removed from the front to the inside of the comic, in black and white, and was drawn by Keith Watson. Over the remaining years the strip varied in format and quality, eventually returning to the front page in colour, until it ended in 1967 with Dan retiring to become Space Fleet controller. Strips from the 1950s were reprinted until 1969, when Eagle merged with Lion. For a while the reprints continued in black and white in Lion. =2000 AD= In 1977, Dan Dare appeared again in the first issue of 2000 AD (26 February 1977).List of Dan Dare stories in 2000AD at 2000ad.org The first instalment, scripted by Ken Armstrong and Pat Mills, had the character revived from suspended animation after two hundred years to find himself in a different world. The Mekon had also survived but otherwise the cast was different, as was the tone of the strip (heavily influenced by the punk movement, as was much of 2000 AD) and the personality of the title character. Written by Kelvin Gosnell and then Steve Moore, the strip was initially illustrated by Massimo Bellardinelli, whose Dare owed nothing to the original apart from the wavy eyebrows. After 23 issues in this format the strip took a break for a month and then returned in a revamped format with a more realistic style, written by Gerry Finley-Day and Jack Adrian (Chris Lowder) and illustrated by Dave Gibbons. Dare was now launched on a deep space mission, much in the style of Star Trek but with technology designs very much influenced by Star Wars. In a series of episodic adventures, Dare encountered various threats, including an extended multi-episode adventure uniting slave races in opposition to the \\"Star Slayers\\" ‚Äì the oppressive race controlling that region. The overall mission had a surprisingly downbeat ending, leaving a space-suited Dare the only survivor, adrift in space on wreckage. The strip was rested for 14 issues, returning early in 1979 in 2000 AD's 100th issue. The amnesiac Dare is rescued from space by the Mekon and indoctrinated into the Mekon's army before eventually recovering his memory. Now penned by Tom Tully but still drawn by Dave Gibbons, this re-imagining of Dare casts him almost as a superhero with a colourful tight-fitting uniform provided by the Mekon. Dare escapes to a planet that is home to an amphibian-like race, which claims he is their Chosen One. There he receives a semi-mystical glove that can shoot energy beams but is unable to prevent the Mekon from acquiring the mystical Crystal of Life. On his return to Earth, he and his Treen companion Sondar find themselves branded traitors and found guilty of helping the Mekon to steal the Crystal. This story arc concluded with the pair escaping the Earth authorities and going on the run to try to clear their names by tracking down the Mekon and recovering the Crystal, establishing the format for the next story arc. Despite promises that Dare and Sondar would be back, the 2000 AD Dan Dare strip \\"Attack on Eternium\\" ended here in prog 126 (18 August 1979). In 1997, to celebrate their 20th anniversary, 2000 AD published two issues with additional free comics, the first a reprint of the first issue of 2000 AD, which starred Dan Dare. The second free comic was a speculative issue called 3000 AD which contained strips partially based on the first issue of 2000 AD. One strip was entitled \\"The Return of Dan Dare\\", which also featured the return of the Mekon. =The new Eagle= In 1982 Eagle was re-launched, with Dan Dare again its flagship strip. The new character was the great-great- great-grandson of the original hero‚Äîthe only surviving character from the original strip being the Mekon. The initial artist was Gerry Embleton, who drew Dan to resemble the original exactly, but he was quickly replaced by Ian Kennedy, who gave the hero a younger look and blond hair. The opening Dan Dare story was an epic, lasting 18 months, written by Pat Mills and John Wagner. It opened with a flashback to the unseen final defeat of the Mekon by the original Dan, after which he was sealed inside an artificial asteroid and exiled into space. Centuries later he was accidentally freed and returned to conquer Earth. A few years later the descendant of his sworn enemy returned from space to find Earth under Treen rule and set out to free the planet. His new cast included Lt Helen Scott, leader of the Earth Resistance, and Valdon, a renegade Treen similar to the earlier Sondar. One controversial aspect of the strip was a lengthy flashback which retconned the original Dan to be a veteran of the Second World War and to have travelled through time to the era in which his adventures in the original Eagle took place‚Äîan attempt to explain why a hero in the age of space travel had a 1950s outlook on life. After this initial storyline other writers were used and different supporting characters came and went, including Professor Pinkerton, a female scientist similar to Professor Peabody, and a new Digby (again, a descendant of the original). The Mekon was generally the foe in alternate stories. In 1987 the strip became more like a space opera, with increasing violence. Now drawn by John Gillatt, Dan took on a tough-guy look. He led space commandos and packed a hi-tech gun reminiscent of that carried by Judge Dredd. The original strip, featuring the original characters of the 1950s Eagle, was revived in 1989, with artist Keith Watson providing the artwork for the initial run of stories. Watson had been part of the Dan Dare team from 1958 to 1960 and was sole artist on Dan Dare from 1962 to 1967. The new Eagle ended in 1994. =Revolver= In 1990, a strip entitled Dare, written by Grant Morrison and drawn by Rian Hughes, was serialised in Revolver. It presented bleak and cynical characters and was a not-too-subtle satire of 1980s British politics, from the perspective of the defeated left wing of the Labour Party. Spacefleet had been privatised, the Treens were subjected to racist abuse in urban ghettos, Digby was unemployed, Professor Peabody committed suicide, and Dare's mentor Sir Hubert Guest betrayed Dare to the Mekon and his quisling British Prime Minister, Gloria Monday (whose appearance and demeanour appear modelled on Margaret Thatcher). Ultimately, Dare destroys London, the Mekon and himself through a smuggled nuclear weapon. The last episode appeared in Crisis, following Revolver's cancellation. This version was not popular. =The Planet= In 1996, The Planet published its first and only issue. Inside was a new and unfinished Dan Dare story, \\"Remembrance\\", drawn by Sydney Jordan featuring a slightly older Dare and apparently set some years after the original Eagle strips. =Virgin Comics= In 2007‚Äì2008 Virgin Comics published a 7 issue Dan Dare mini-series written by Garth Ennis, with art by Gary Erskine. Virgin's founder and chairman Richard Branson is a fan of the character.Virgin takes up 'Dare', Variety, August 26, 2007 The series is set several years after the original strips. Space Fleet has collapsed along with the UN due to nuclear war between China and America; Britain survived due to defensive shields made by Professor Peabody, and has become a world power again as a result, with the Royal Navy taking Space Fleet's role. Peabody is the Home Secretary to a Prime Minister modelled on Tony Blair, who has sold Earth's defence out to The Mekon out of fear of overwhelming odds. Dare, assisted by Digby (who sacrifices himself in battle) leads a spirited defence of both Earth and his honourable principles. =Spaceship Away= Launched in October 2003, Spaceship Away magazine was originally created in order to get \\"The Phoenix Mission\\" (a 1950s style story by Rod Barzilay with art by Keith Watson and Don Harley) into publication, with the agreement of the Dan Dare Corporation. Response was good enough to warrant the magazine's continuation following that strip's conclusion, initially with \\"Green Nemesis\\" (again by Barzilay and Don Harley, with later chapters drawn by David Pugh and Tim Booth. Other stories have since followed. Despite a fairly small circulation (it is available only via mail order, through its own Web site or in a select few comic shops), Spaceship Away continues to appear three times a year. =Titan Comics= In 2017‚Äì18 a four- issue mini-series by Peter Milligan and Alberto Foche was published by Titan Comics.\\"Dare to be Different\\" by Stephen Jewell, Judge Dredd Megazine #390, 2017 In other media=Radio=Radio Luxembourg serial 208 magazine in March 1952 The New Adventures of Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future aired five times a week on Radio Luxembourg for five years from 2 July 1951. Dan's voice was Noel Johnson, who also played Dick Barton on BBC radio.Obituary: Noel Johnson The Guardian Each episode started with the command \\"Spaceships Away!\\". The 15-minute show was sponsored by Horlicks and on 3 March 1952, the 106th episode of Dan Dare was heard that Monday night with different episodes on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday at 7:15pm. Although the dramatisation was recorded on wax discs for broadcast, the original discs were lost or destroyed. Until recently no copies had ever been recovered but in late 2011 two episodes were found as part of the Lost Shows Appeal, orchestrated by missing episode hunter Charles Norton. The recovered shows were \\"Under Sentence of Death\\" (episode 76), aired on 21 January 1952, and \\"The Lost World On Mars\\" (episode 53), aired on 19 March 1953. Radio Madrid serial \\"Diego Valor\\" Spanish adaptation of Dan Dare from 1954 BBC adaptation From 19 April ‚Äì 10 May 1990, BBC Radio 4 aired a four- part adaptation of Voyage to Venus, dramatised by Nick McCarty and directed by Glyn Dearman. The cast included Mick Ford (Col. Dan Dare), Donald Gee (Digby), Richard Pearce (the Mekon), Terence Alexander (Sir Hubert Guest), Zelah Clarke (Prof. Peabody), William Roberts (Hank Hogan), Sean Barrett (Pierre Lafayette), John Moffatt (Kalon), Shirley Dixon (Mrs. Digby), Ben Onwukwe (Volstar), David Goudge (Sondar), Margaret Courtenay (Aunt Anastasia), Brian Miller (Urtag), David King (Dapon). B7 Media adaptation In September 2015, B7 Media announced it had secured the rights to produce a new Dan Dare audio drama series from the Dan Dare Corporation. The lead writers were announced as Richard Kurti and Bev Doyle, with Andrew Mark Sewell as director and Simon Moorhead as producer; John Freeman would serve as creative consultant. The first volume, released in 2016, starred Ed Stoppard as Dan Dare, Geoff McGivern as Digby, Heida Reed as Professor Peabody, Raad Rawi as the Mekon and Bijan Daneshmand as Sondar; Volume 2 was released in 2017. Both volumes were produced in association with Big Finish Productions. BBC Radio 4 Extra began airing the B7 episodes in August 2018. =Television= In the 1980s, a series of live-action adverts for Mobil motor oil featured Dan and Digby in comedic situations, trying to get their rockets to go faster. The dialogue was straight from wartime upper class RAF officers' slang. In 2002, Dan Dare: Pilot of the Future became a computer-generated TV series produced first by Netter Digital then by Foundation Imaging, running to twenty-six 22-minute episodes. The series drew on several comic book incarnations. It started on Nicktoons UK on 5 November 2005 at 6.30 pm. Two abortive attempts had been made to make a live-action series, in 1981 and 1991. James Fox and Robert Bathurst were reportedly lined up to play Dare respectively. In 1991 a short pilot starring Bathurst as Dare, and Geoffrey Hughes as Digby was made. Parts of it were broadcast in an ITV documentary, Future Perfect. =Film= In 2010, Variety announced that Warner Bros. was planning to produce a Dan Dare movie starring Sam Worthington in the title role. =Computer games= During the 1980s Dan Dare starred in three computer games for the Commodore 64/128, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC and Atari computers. The first was a different game on each system; the second and third were shoot'em-ups. All three were based on the 1950s strip rather than the contemporary comics. *Dan Dare: Pilot of the Future (1986, Electronic Arts, re-released by Ricochet) *Dan Dare II: The Mekon's Revenge (1988, Virgin Games, re-released by Ricochet) *Dan Dare III: The Escape (1990, Virgin Games) =Console video games= The protagonist human character from the Gaiares science fiction space shooter starfighter combat game released in Japan in 1990 was changed from an original character called Dan Diaz to the legendary Sci-fi hero Dan Dare in the English translated western version. =Music= Pink Floyd founder Syd Barrett wrote Dan Dare into his song \\"Astronomy Domine\\", from the band's debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, with the line \\"Stairway scare, Dan Dare, who's there?\\" David Bowie's song \\"D.J.\\" contains the somewhat obscure lyric: \\"I feel like Dan Dare lies down\\" Sir Elton John recorded \\"Dan Dare (Pilot Of The Future)\\" for his 1975 album Rock Of The Westies. British punk rock group The Mekons included a song \\"Dan Dare\\" on their album The Quality of Mercy is not Strnen. The album Below the Waste by the Art of Noise opened with the song \\"Dan Dare\\" The relaunch of the Eagle Magazine in 1982 saw a free single giveaway of a track called Dan Dare by the group Loose Talk. Characters inspired by Dan Dare Characters inspired by or based on Dan Dare have appeared throughout British popular culture. One example is Wing Commander Leyton in British Summertime by Paul Cornell, which juxtaposes the utopian future portrayed in the original comics with the Britain of today. In the 1980s, Private Eye published Dan Dire, Pilot of Future?. Dire was based on politician Neil Kinnock, the question being whether he'd ever become Prime Minister. Dire's enemy was the Maggon, a combination of the Mekon and Margaret Thatcher.'Sufferin' Satellites, Dan Dare is Back!', the Independent, 14 April 1990 Radio DJ and Comedian Kenny Everett's character Captain Kremmen was inspired by Dan Dare. A porcine pastiche, Ham Dare: Pig of the Future, written by Lew Stringer and with art by Malcolm Douglas, appeared in Oink! comic. Marvel Comics created a Dan Dare-esque character in their Captain Britain line in the 1980s. The character was Roy Risk, one of the British heroes killed by The Fury. In Jonathan Hickman's Avengers series, the character Smasher's secret identity is astronomer Isabel 'Izzy' Dare whose dying elderly grandfather alludes to Izzy as inheriting a destiny from him. He hand her a business card that expresses a deep friendship with Captain America. The card reveals the grandfather's name as Dan. In the trade hardcover for Avengers, Izzy's last name is changed to Kane, meaning her grandfather is Marvel's Captain Terror. In his Afterword to Ministry of Space, Warren Ellis lists Dan Dare as one of the inspirations for the story, in which Britain forges an ambitious space programme in the decades following World War II. Sir John Dashwood, the central character of Ministry of Space, is a cynical version of Dan Dare himself.Ellis, W: \\"Ministry Of Space\\", 'The Afterword'. Titan Books, 2005 Captain Jack Harkness, the Doctor Who and Torchwood character, has several similarities to Dan Dare. The script for the episode \\"The Empty Child\\" in which Captain Jack makes his first appearance describes him as having \\"the jawline of Dan Dare, the smile of a bastard\\".

From references to the work that survived, it is known that its central character is an exceedingly stupid man named Margites (from ancient Greek , margos, \\"raving, mad; lustful\\") who was so dense he did not know which parent had given birth to him.Stuart Kelly, The Book of Lost Books, New York: Random House, 2005. His name gave rise to the recherch√© adjective margitomanƒìs (), \\"mad as Margites\\", used by Philodemus.Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon revised edition, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1940. It was commonly attributed to Homer, as by Aristotle (Poetics 13.92): \\"His Margites indeed provides an analogy: as are the Iliad and Odyssey to our tragedies, so is the Margites to our comedies\\"; but the work, among a mixed genre of works loosely labelled \\"Homerica\\" in antiquity, was attributed to Pigres, a Greek poet of Halicarnassus, in the massive medieval Greek encyclopedia called the Suda. Harpocration, also writes that it is attributed to Homer.Harpokration, Lexicon of the Ten Orators, ¬ß m6 Basil of Caesarea writes that the work is attributed to Homer but he states that he is unsure regarding this attribution.Advice to Young Men on Greek Literature, Basil of Caesarea, ¬ß 8 It is written in mixed hexameter and iambic lines, an odd whim of Pigres, who also inserted a pentameter line after each hexameter of the Iliad as a curious literary game.Harry Thurston Peck, Harpers Dictionary of Classical Antiquity, New York, 1898. Margites was famous in the ancient world, but only these following lines passed from Medieval tradition: :Him, then, the Gods made neither a delver nor a ploughman, :Nor in any other way wise; he failed every art. ::as quoted by Aristotle :He knew many things, but he knew them badly ... ::as quoted by Plato :There came to Colophon an old man and divine singer, :a servant of the Muses and of far-shooting Apollo. :In his dear hands he held a sweet-toned lyre ... ::as quoted by Atilius Fortunatianus :The fox knows many a wile; :but the hedgehog's one trick can beat them all. ::as quoted by Zenobius (attributed simply to \\"Homer\\") In Oxyrhynchus, a few papyrus fragments were found and published (P.Oxy 2309, 3693 and 3694). The collected fragments were included in volume II of Iambi et Elegi Graeci ante Alexandrum cantati by M. L. West.

He stimulated physical scientists' interest into biology, especially as to basic research to physically explain genes, mysterious at the time. Formed in 1945 and led by Delbr√ºck along with Salvador Luria and Alfred Hershey, the Phage Group made substantial headway unraveling important aspects of genetics. The three shared the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \\"for their discoveries concerning the replication mechanism and the genetic structure of viruses\\".\\"The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1969\\", Nobel Media AB 2013, Nobelprize.org, Web acces November 6, 2013. He was the first physicist to predict what is now called Delbr√ºck scattering. Early and personal life Delbr√ºck in the early 1940s Delbr√ºck was born in Berlin, German Empire. His mother was granddaughter of Justus von Liebig, an eminent chemist, while his father Hans Delbr√ºck was a history professor at the University of Berlin. In 1937, Delbr√ºck left Nazi Germany for America‚Äîfirst California, then Tennessee‚Äîbecoming a US citizen in 1945. In 1941, he married Mary Bruce. They had four children. Delbr√ºck's brother Justus, a lawyer, as well as his sister Emmi Bonhoeffer were active along with his brothers-in-law Klaus Bonhoeffer and Dietrich Bonhoeffer in resistance to Nazism. Found guilty by the People's Court for roles in the July 20, 1944 plot to assassinate Hitler, Dietrich and Klaus were executed in 1945 by the RSHA. Justus died in Soviet custody that same year. Education Delbr√ºck studied astrophysics, shifting towards theoretical physics, at the University of G√∂ttingen. After completing his Ph.D. there in 1930,\\"Max Delbr√ºck\\". Encyclopaedia Britannica. britannica.com. Retrieved January 27, 2019. he traveled through England, Denmark, and Switzerland. He met Wolfgang Pauli and Niels Bohr, who interested him in biology. Career and research Delbr√ºck's workplace in Berlin: Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry, now the Free University of Berlin. Delbr√ºck returned to Berlin in 1932 as an assistant to Lise Meitner, who was collaborating with Otto Hahn on irradiation of uranium with neutrons. Delbr√ºck wrote a few papers, including one in 1933 on gamma rays' scattering by a Coulomb field's polarization of a vacuum. Though theoretically tenable, his conclusion was misplaced, whereas Hans Bethe some 20 years later confirmed the phenomenon and named it \\"Delbr√ºck scattering\\". In 1935, Delbr√ºck published a collaboration with Nikolay Timofeev-Ressovsky and Karl Zimmer the major work, √úber die Natur der Genmutation und der Genstruktur. It was considered to be a major advance in understanding the nature of gene mutation and gene structure.Timofeeff-Ressovky, N. W., K. G. Zimmer, and M. Delbr√ºck \\"√úber die Natur der Genmutation und der Genstruktur\\" (Weidmannsche Buchhandlung, 1935). Nachrichten G√∂ttingen - \\"√úber die Natur der Genmutation und der Genstruktur\\" (1935). The work was a keystone in the formation of molecular genetics. It was also an inspirational starting point for Erwin Schr√∂dinger's thinking, a course of lectures in 1943, and the eventual writing of the book What Is Life? The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell.Erwin Schr√∂dinger What Is Life? The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell (Cambridge University Press, 1944). In 1937, he attained a fellowship from Rockefeller Foundation‚Äîwhich was launching the molecular biology research program‚Äîto research genetics of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, in California Institute of Technology's biology department,\\"MDC celebrates centennial of Max Delbr√ºck\\". Max Delbr√ºck Center for Molecular Medicine Berli- Buch. September 4, 2006. where Delbr√ºck could blend interests in biochemistry and genetics. While at Caltech, Delbr√ºck researched bacteria and their viruses (bacteriophages or phages). In 1939, with Emory L. Ellis, he coauthored \\"The growth of bacteriophage\\", a paper reporting that the viruses reproduce in one step, not exponentially as do cellular organisms.

In 1941, Delbr√ºck met Salvador Luria of Indiana University who began visiting Vanderbilt. In 1942, Delbr√ºck and Luria published on bacterial resistance to virus infection mediated by random mutation. Alfred Hershey of Washington University began visiting in 1943. The Luria‚ÄìDelbr√ºck experiment, also called the Fluctuation Test, demonstrated that Darwin's theory of natural selection acting on random mutations applies to bacteria as well as to more complex organisms. The 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to both scientists in part for this work. To put this work in its historical perspective, Lamarck in 1801 first presented his theory of Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics, which stated that if an organism changes during life in order to adapt to its environment (for example stretches its neck to reach for tall trees), those changes are passed on to its offspring. He also said that evolution happens according to a predetermined plan. Darwin published his theory of evolution in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species with compelling evidence contradicting Lamarck. Darwin said that evolution is not predetermined but that there are inherent variations in all organisms, and that those variations that confer increased fitness are selected by the environment and passed on to the offspring. In the feud between Lamarck and Darwin, Darwin talked of pre- existing changes, but the nature of these changes was not known and had to await the science of genetics by Gregor Mendel's experiments on pea plants published in 1866. Support for Darwin's theory was provided when Thomas Hunt Morgan discovered that a mutated white-eyed fruit fly among red-eyed flies was able to reproduce true white-eyed offspring. The most elegant and convincing support for Darwin's ideas, however, was provided by the Luria-Delbruck experiment, which showed that mutations conferring resistance of the bacterium E. coli to T1 bacteriophage (virus) existed in the population prior to exposure to T1 and were not induced by adding T1. In other words, mutations are random events that occur whether or not they prove to be useful, while selection (for T1 resistance upon challenge with T1 in this case) provides the direction in evolution by retaining those mutations that are advantageous, discarding those that are harmful (T1 sensitivity in this case). This experiment dealt a blow to Lamarckian inheritance and set the stage for tremendous advances in genetics and molecular biology, launching a tsunami of research that eventually led to the discovery of DNA as the hereditary material and to cracking the genetic code. In 1945, Delbr√ºck, Luria, and Hershey set up a course in bacteriophage genetics at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in Long Island, New York. This Phage Group spurred molecular biology's early development.J.D. Watson (2012). \\"James D Watson: Chancellor emeritus\\" , Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Delbr√ºck received the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, shared with Luria and Hershey \\"for their discoveries concerning the replication mechanism and the genetic structure of viruses\\". The committee also noted that \\"The honour in the first place goes to Delbr√ºck who transformed bacteriophage research from vague empiricism to an exact science. He analyzed and defined the conditions for precise measurement of the biological effects. Together with Luria he elaborated the quantitative methods and established the statistical criteria for evaluation which made the subsequent penetrating studies possible. Delbr√ºck's and Luria's forte is perhaps mainly theoretical analysis, whereas Hershey above all is an eminently skillful experimenter. The three of them supplement each other well also in these respects.\\" That year, Delbr√ºck and Luria were also awarded by Columbia University the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize. In late 1947, as Vanderbilt lacked the resources to keep him, Delbr√ºck had returned to Caltech as a professor of biology, and remained there for the rest of his career. Meanwhile, he set up University of Cologne's institute for molecular genetics.√º Awards and honours In addition to the Nobel Prize, Delbr√ºck was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1967. He was elected an EMBO Member in 1970. The Max Delbruck Prize, formerly known as the biological physics prize, is awarded by the American Physical Society and named in his honour. The Max Delbr√ºck Center, in Berlin, Germany, national research center for molecular medicine of the Helmholtz Association also bears his name. Later life and legacy Delbr√ºck helped spur physical scientists' interest in biology. His inferences on genes' susceptibility to mutation was relied on by physicist Erwin Schr√∂dinger in his 1944 book What Is Life?, which conjectured genes were an \\"aperiodic crystal\\" storing codescript and influenced Francis Crick and James D. Watson in their 1953 identification of cellular DNA's molecular structure as a double helix.M. P. Murphy and L. A. J. O'Neill (1997).

In 1977, he retired from Caltech, remaining a Professor of Biology emeritus. Max Delbr√ºck died, at age 74, on the evening of Monday, March 9, 1981, at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, California.

HT Winter 2007. Although Delbr√ºck held some anti-reductionist views; he conjectured that ultimately a paradox‚Äîakin perhaps to the waveparticle duality of physics‚Äîwould be revealed about life. His view however, was later refuted upon the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA.

In 2016, The Atomic Cafe was one of the 25 films selected for preservation in the annual United States' National Film Registry of the Library of Congress for being deemed \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". The press release for the Registry stated that \\"The influential film compilation 'Atomic Cafe' provocatively documents the post-World War II threat of nuclear war as depicted in a wide assortment of archival footage from the period.\\" Synopsis The film covers the beginnings of the era of nuclear warfare, created from a broad range of archival material from the 1940s, 1950s and early 1960s including newsreel clips, television news footage, U.S. government-produced films (including military training films), advertisements, television and radio programs. News footage reflected the prevailing understanding of the media and public. Though the topic of atomic holocaust is a grave matter, The Atomic Cafe approaches it with black humor. Much of the humor derives from the modern audience's reaction to the old training films, such as the Duck and Cover film shown in schools. A quote to illustrate what can be perceived as black humor, culled from the movie: \\"Viewed from a safe distance, the atomic bomb is one of the most beautiful sights ever seen by man,\\" a U.S. Army training film declares.  Historical context  The Atomic Cafe was released at the height of nostalgia and cynicism in America. By 1982, Americans lost much of their faith in their government following the Vietnam War, the Watergate scandal,PopMatters and the seemingly never-ending arms race with the Soviet Union.McLane Betsy. \\"Film Quarterly\\", film review, Spring 1983. Last accessed: November 27, 2012. The Atomic Cafe reflects and reinforces this idea as it exposes how the atomic bomb's dangers were downplayed and how the government used films to shape public opinion. The Atomic Cafe was also released during the Reagan Administration's forced civil defense revival.Conelrad: All Things Atomic. The Atomic Cafe, Jayne Loader Interview. Last accessed: November 26, 2012. Barry Posen and Stephen Van Evera explain this revival in their article \\"Defense Policy and the Reagan Administration: Departure from Containment\\" published in International Security. They argue that in 1981‚Äì82 the Reagan Administration was moving from an essentially defensive grand strategy of containment to a more offensive strategy. Due to the greater demands of its more offensive strategy \\"the Reagan Administration ... proposed the biggest military buildup since the Korean War.\\"Posen, R. Barry \\"Defense Policy and the Reagan Administration: Departure from Containment\\", Journal article. Last accessed: November 27, 2012. Of key relevance to The Atomic Cafe, the Reagan move toward offense included the adoption of a more aggressive nuclear strategy that required a large U.S. nuclear buildup. Containment only required that U.S. strategic nuclear forces be capable of one mission: inflicting unacceptable damage on the Soviet Union even after absorbing an all-out Soviet surprise attack. To this \\"assured destruction\\" mission the Reagan administration added a second \\"counterforce\\" mission, which required the capacity to launch a nuclear first strike against Soviet strategic nuclear forces that would leave the Soviets unable to inflict unacceptable damage on the U.S. in retaliation. The U.S. had always invested in counterforce but the Reagan administration put even greater emphasis on it. The counterforce mission was far more demanding than the assured destruction mission, and required a vast expansion of U.S. nuclear forces to fulfill. Civil defense was a component of a counterforce strategy, as it reduced Soviet retaliatory capacity, hence civil defense was a candidate for more spending under Reagan's counterforce nuclear strategy. Posen and Van Evera argue that this counterforce strategy was a warrant for an open-ended U.S. nuclear buildup. Bob Mielke, in \\"Rhetoric and Ideology in the Nuclear Test Documentary\\" (Film Quarterly) discusses the release of The Atomic Cafe: \\"This satire feature was released at the height of the nuclear freeze movement (which was in turn responding to the Reagan administration's surreal handling of the arms race.)\\"Mielke Bob. \\"Film Quarterly\\", film review, Spring 2005. Last Accessed: November 27, 2012. Patricia Aufderheide, in Documentary Film: A Very Short Introduction touches on the significance of The Atomic Cafe as a window into the past of government propaganda and disinformation during the years following the advent of the Atomic Bomb. \\"Propaganda, also known as disinformation, public diplomacy, and strategic communication, continues to be an important tool for governments. But stand-alone documentary is no longer an important part of public relations campaigns aimed at the general public.\\" Production The Atomic Cafe was produced over a five-year period through the collaborative efforts of three directors: Jayne Loader and brothers Kevin and Pierce Rafferty. For this film, the Rafferty brothers and Loader formed a production company called The Archives Project. The filmmakers opted not to use narration. Instead, they deployed carefully constructed sequences of film clips to make their points. Jayne Loader has referred to The Atomic Cafe as \\"compilation verite\\": a compilation film with no \\"Voice of God\\" narration and no new footage added by the filmmakers.Conelrad: All Things Atomic.

Jayne Loader stated in an interview, \\"Had we relied on grants, we would have starved\\" The Atomic Cafe, Jayne Loader Interview. Last accessed: November 14, 2011. Pierce Rafferty helped to support the team and the film financially by working as a consultant and researcher on several other documentary films including El Salvador‚ÄîAnother Vietnam, the Oscar-nominated With Babies and Banners, and The Life and Times of Rosie the Riveter (which also was inducted into the National Film Registry).Harrington, Richard. \\"Blast from the Past: 'Atomic Cafe': A Stunning Cold War Collage.\\" The Washington Post 14 May 1982, C1 sec. The Rafferty brothers had also received an inheritance that they used to support the team during the five years it took to make the film. About 75% of the film is made up of government materials that were in the public domain. Though they could use those public domain materials for free, they had to make copies of the films at their own expense. This along with the newsreel and commercial stock footage that comprises the other 25% of the film (along with the music royalties) represents the bulk of the trio's expenditures. Release The film was released on March 17, 1982 in New York, New York.

Reception=Critical response= When The Atomic Cafe was released, film critic Roger Ebert discussed the style and methods the filmmakers used, writing, \\"The makers of The Atomic Cafe sifted through thousands of feet of Army films, newsreels, government propaganda films and old television broadcasts to come up with the material in their film, which is presented without any narration, as a record of some of the ways in which the bomb entered American folklore.

Chicago Sun-Times, film review, January 1, 1982. Last accessed: February 20, 2011. Critic Vincent Canby of the New York Times praised the film, calling the film \\"a devastating collage-film that examines official and unofficial United States attitudes toward the atomic age\\" and a film that \\"deserves national attention.\\" Canby was so taken by The Atomic Cafe that he mentioned it in a subsequent articles‚Äîcomparing it, favorably, to the blockbuster Porky's. More recently, critic Glenn Erickson discussed the editorial message of the film's producers: \\"The makers of The Atomic Cafe clearly have a message to get across, and to achieve that goal they use the inherent absurdity of their source material in creative ways. But they're careful to make sure they leave them essentially untransformed. When we see Nixon and J. Edgar Hoover posing with a strip of microfilm, we know we're watching a newsreel. The content isn't cheated. Except in wrapup montages, narration from one source isn't used over another. When raw footage is available, candid moments are seen of speechmakers (including President Truman) when they don't know the cameras are rolling.

This annual ceremony was discontinued in 1975. The Riksdag is the national legislature of Sweden. However, when it was founded in 1866 Sweden did not have a parliamentary system of government. The national legislatures of Estonia and Finland are also called Riksdag in Swedish.  The Old Riksdag  The precursor to the modern Riksdag was the Riksdag of the Estates (). Of ancient origin in the Viking Things, the 1435 meeting in the city of Arboga is considered the first Riksdag, however only three of the estates were probably present the nobility, the clergy and the burghersriksdagen.se. This informal representation was formalized in 1527 by King Gustav I of Sweden to include representatives of all the four estates, which historically reflected the lines of division in Swedish society: the nobility, the clergy, the burghers and the peasantry. Under the Instrument of Government of 1809 the Riksdag shared the powers of government with the King.  The New Riksdag  On the basis of the 1863 electoral reform bill the Estates voted in 1866 to dissolve the Riksdag of the Estates and establish a new Riksdag. The new Riksdag was a political assembly with two chambers where the members were chosen in national elections. The revolution was that citizens could participate and vote in the elections without regard to which Estate they had hitherto belonged; instead there were new requirements on income or wealth, i.e. census suffrage. Despite the fundamental change in the principles of representation, the social composition of the Riksdag did not alter by much, and the system of government had not changed. Under the Constitution of 1809 the Riksdag still divided the powers of government with the King.  Democracy emerges  From the second half of the 19th century, when the Riksdag was founded, until the early 20th century, Swedish society underwent a number of fundamental changes that impacted on the political system. Political demands, but also sheer economic progress, increased the share of citizens eligible to vote and have a direct influence on the political system. This in turn also sponsored the emergence and growth of political parties. The Riksdag had also been able to assert itself against the Royal authority and a de facto parliamentary system had begun to emerge. As of the general election in 1921, universal and equal franchise was introduced for men and women alike, and the Riksdag finally achieved a system of democratic representation for all citizens who were at least 23 years old on election day. The last time the king attempted to exercise political authority was in February 1914 when King Gustav V delivered a speech to 30,000 peasants, assembled on the yard of the Royal Castle in Stockholm, an action which precipitated the fall the incumbent liberal cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Karl Staaff. In the face of popular unrest and gains for Liberals and Socialists in general elections 1917 the King hesitantly accepted to appoint a new Cabinet in accordance with the principles of Parliamentarism. The new government's main task was to present bills on democratization. The voting franchise had been extended to all adult males in 1907 and women's suffrage gave them the same rights in 1921. By this Sweden had established a democratic and parliamentary system of government.  Constitutional reform  In the 1960s debates intensified over constitutional reform in Sweden. The fundamental question was over the system of government. Even though a de facto parliamentary system was firmly established, somewhat similar to the situation in the United Kingdom, there were demands for a more democratic constitution. One of the main issues was whether the monarchy would survive constitutional reform and this blocked the issue for a long time. Effective from 1970 a reform of the Riksdag had been agreed upon. Though not technically part of the constitution it showed that the parties in the Riksdag were able to agree upon fundamental changes of the political system, which transformed the Riksdag from a bicameral legislature into a unicameral one. This would have 350 seats, all of which would be filled by direct election. However, the second general election to the unicameral Riksdag only gave the government support from 175 members, while the opposition could mobilize an equal force of 175 members, resulting in what became known as the \\"lottery Riksdag\\", in which the Speaker had to draw lots to resolve deadlocked votes. In 1974 it was decided that the number of seats from 1977 were to be reduced to 349.  Present  In 1974 a new Instrument of Government was established as a vital part of the Constitution and for the system of government. The monarchy was retained, whereas the monarch lost all formal political influence and became only a symbolic head of state. Several of the traditional head-of-state functions have instead been transferred to the Speaker of the Riksdag.

It includes more specific mental states such as happiness, entertainment, enjoyment, ecstasy and euphoria. The early psychological concept of pleasure, the pleasure principle, describes it as a positive feedback mechanism that motivates the organism to recreate the situation it has just found pleasurable, and to avoid past situations that caused pain. The experience of pleasure is subjective and different individuals experience different kinds and amounts of pleasure in the same situation. Many pleasurable experiences are associated with satisfying basic biological drives, such as eating, exercise, hygiene, sleep, and sex. The appreciation of cultural artifacts and activities such as art, music, dancing, and literature is often pleasurable. Based upon the incentive salience model of reward ‚Äì the attractive and motivational property of a stimulus that induces approach behavior and consummatory behavior ‚Äì an intrinsic reward has two components: a \\"wanting\\" or desire component that is reflected in approach behavior, and a \\"liking\\" or pleasure component that is reflected in consummatory behavior. While all pleasurable stimuli are rewards, some rewards do not evoke pleasure. Neuropsychology=Neural substratesPsychology= Study for Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm by William Etty, 1822 Pleasure is considered one of the core dimensions of emotion. It can be described as the positive evaluation that forms the basis for several more elaborate evaluations such as \\"agreeable\\" or \\"nice\\". As such, pleasure is an affect and not an emotion, as it forms one component of several different emotions. Pleasure is sometimes subdivided into fundamental pleasures that are closely related to survival (food, sex, and social belonging) and higher-order pleasures (e.g., viewing art and altruism). The clinical condition of being unable to experience pleasure from usually enjoyable activities is called anhedonia. An active aversion to obtaining pleasure is called hedonophobia. Pleasure is often regarded as a bipolar construct, meaning that the two ends of the spectrum from pleasure to suffering are mutually exclusive. That is part of the circumplex model of affect. Yet, some lines of research suggest that people do experience pleasure and suffering at the same time, giving rise to so-called mixed feelings. The degree to which something or someone is experienced as pleasurable not only depends on its objective attributes (appearance, sound, taste, texture, etc.), but on beliefs about its history, about the circumstances of its creation, about its rarity, fame, or price, and on other non-intrinsic attributes, such as the social status or identity it conveys. For example, a sweater that has been worn by a celebrity is more desired than an otherwise identical sweater that has not, though considerably less so if it has been washed.Paul Bloom.

Another example was when Grammy-winning, internationally acclaimed violinist Joshua Bell played in the Washington D.C. subway for 43 minutes, attracting little attention from the 1,097 people who passed by, and earning about $59 in tips. Paul Bloom describes these phenomena as arising from a form of essentialism. Philosophy Various philosophical approaches to utilitarianism and hedonism advocate maximizing the amount of pleasure and minimizing the amount of suffering. =Hellenistic philosophy= The ancient Cyrenaics posited pleasure as the universal aim for all people. Later, Epicurus defined the highest pleasure as aponia (the absence of pain),The Forty Principal Doctrines, Number III. and pleasure as \\"freedom from pain in the body and freedom from turmoil in the soul\\".Letter to Menoeceus , Section 131-2. According to Cicero (or rather his character Torquatus) Epicurus also believed that pleasure was the chief good and pain the chief evil.About the Ends of Goods and Evils, Book I , From Section IX, Torquatus sets out his understanding of Epicurus's philosophy. The Pyrrhonist philosopher Aenesidemus claimed that following Pyrrhonism's prescriptions for philosophical skepticism produced pleasure.Eusebius Praeparatio Evangelica Chapter 18 =Medieval philosophy= In the 12th century, Razi's \\"Treatise of the Self and the Spirit\\" (Kitab al Nafs Wa‚Äôl Ruh) analyzed different types of pleasure- sensuous and intellectual, and explained their relations with one another. He concludes that human needs and desires are endless, and \\"their satisfaction is by definition impossible.\\" =Modern philosophy= The 19th-century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer understood pleasure as a negative sensation, one that negates the usual existential condition of suffering.Counsels and Maxims , Chapter 1, General Rules Section 1. As a uniquely human experience In the past, there has been debate as to whether pleasure is experienced by other animals rather than being an exclusive property of humankind; however, it is now known that animals do experience pleasure, as measured by objective behavioral and neural hedonic responses to pleasurable stimuli.

The term happiness is used in the context of mental or emotional states, including positive or pleasant emotions ranging from contentment to intense joy. It is also used in the context of life satisfaction, subjective well-being, eudaimonia, flourishing and well-being.See definition section below. Since the 1960s, happiness research has been conducted in a wide variety of scientific disciplines, including gerontology, social psychology and positive psychology, clinical and medical research and happiness economics.  Definitions  'Happiness' is the subject of debate on usage and meaning,The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy states that \\"An important project in the philosophy of happiness is simply getting clear on what various writers are talking about.\\" https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/happiness/ and on possible differences in understanding by culture.\\"How Universal is Happiness?\\" Ruut Veenhoven, Chapter 11 in Ed Diener, John F.

Call it emotional well-being. Happiness as emotional well-being concerns your emotions and moods, more broadly your emotional condition as a whole. To be happy is to inhabit a favorable emotional state.... On this view, we can think of happiness, loosely, as the opposite of anxiety and depression. Being in good spirits, quick to laugh and slow to anger, at peace and untroubled, confident and comfortable in your own skin, engaged, energetic and full of life.\\" https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/13/happiness-and-its- discontents/ Haybron has also used the term thymic, by which he means 'overall mood state' in this context; https://philpapers.org/rec/HAYHAE Xavier Landes has described a similar concept of mood. https://www.satori.lv/article/kas-ir- laime For instance Daniel Kahneman has defined happiness as \\"what I experience here and now\\".\\"People don‚Äôt want to be happy the way I‚Äôve defined the term ‚Äì what I experience here and now.

And in philosophy it is possible to speak of the happiness of a person‚Äôs life, or of their happy life, even if that person was in fact usually pretty miserable. The point is that some good things in their life made it a happy one, even though they lacked contentment. But this usage is uncommon, and may cause confusion.' https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/well-being/ 2017 Kahneman has said that this is more important to people than current experience.‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt want to be happy the way I‚Äôve defined the term ‚Äì what I experience here and now.

Yet the correlation of household income with the affect measures is far weaker: globally, .17 for positive affect, ‚Äì.09 for negative affect; and in the United States, essentially zero above $75,000 (though quite strong at low income levels). If the results hold up, the upshot appears to be that income is pretty strongly related to life satisfaction, but weakly related to emotional well-being, at least above a certain threshold.\\" Section 3.3, Happiness, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/happiness/#HedVerEmoSta \\"High income improves evaluation of life but not emotional well-being\\", Daniel Kahneman and Angus Deaton, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 21/9/10 Whereas Nordic countries often score highest on swb surveys, South American countries score higher on affect-based surveys of current positive life experiencing. The implied meaning of the word may vary depending on context,\\"How does happiness come into this classification? For better or worse, it enters in three ways. It is sometimes used as a current emotional report ‚Äì ‚ÄúHow happy are you now?,‚Äù sometimes as a remembered emotion, as in ‚ÄúHow happy were you yesterday?,‚Äù and very often as a form of life evaluation, as in ‚ÄúHow happy are you with your life as a whole these days?‚Äù People answer these three types of happiness question differently, so it is important to keep track of what is being asked. The good news is that the answers differ in ways that suggest that people understand what they are being asked, and answer appropriately.\\" John Helliwell and Shun Yang, p11, World Happiness Report 2012 http://worldhappiness.report/ed/2012/ qualifying happiness as a polyseme and a fuzzy concept. A further issue is when measurement is made; appraisal of level of happiness at the time of the experience may be different from appraisal via memory at a later date.\\"Looking back, I think I can separate the years when I was happy and those when I was unhappy. But perhaps at the time I should have judged differently.\\" William Inge, Lay Thoughts of a Dean (1926), p211. See e.g. https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.209347 Some users accept these issues, but continue to use the word because of its convening power.\\"Some have argued that it is misleading to use ‚Äòhappiness‚Äô as a generic term to cover subjective well-being more generally. While ‚Äòsubjective well- being‚Äô is more precise, it simply does not have the convening power of ‚Äòhappiness‚Äô. The main linguistic argument for using happiness in a broader generic role is that happiness plays two important roles within the science of well-being, appearing once as a prototypical positive emotion and again as part of a cognitive life evaluation question. This double use has sometimes been used to argue that there is no coherent structure to happiness responses. The converse argument made in the World Happiness Reports is that this double usage helps to justify using happiness in a generic role, as long as the alternative meanings are clearly understood and credibly related. Evidence from a growing number of large scale surveys shows that the answers to questions asking about the emotion of happiness differ from answers to judgmental questions asking about a person‚Äôs happiness with life as a whole in exactly the ways that theory would suggest. Answers to questions about the emotion of happiness relate well to what is happening at the moment. Evaluative answers, in response to questions about life as a whole, are supported by positive emotions, as noted above, but also driven much more, than are answers to questions about emotions, by a variety of life circumstances, including income, health and social trust.\\" John F. Helliwell and others, World Happiness Report, 2015, quoted in What's Special About Happiness as a Social Indicator? John F. Helliwell, Published online: 25 February 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2017.  Philosophy  A butcher happily slicing meat. Philosophy of happiness is often discussed in conjunction with ethics. Traditional European societies, inherited from the Greeks and from Christianity, often linked happiness with morality, which was concerned with the performance in a certain kind of role in a certain kind of social life. However, with the rise of individualism, begotten partly by Protestantism and capitalism, the links between duty in a society and happiness were gradually broken. The consequence was a redefinition of the moral terms. Happiness is no longer defined in relation to social life, but in terms of individual psychology. Happiness, however, remains a difficult term for moral philosophy. Throughout the history of moral philosophy, there has been an oscillation between attempts to define morality in terms of consequences leading to happiness and attempts to define morality in terms that have nothing to do with happiness at all. In the Nicomachean Ethics, written in 350 BCE, Aristotle stated that happiness (also being well and doing well) is the only thing that humans desire for their own sake, unlike riches, honour, health or friendship. He observed that men sought riches, or honour, or health not only for their own sake but also in order to be happy. For Aristotle the term eudaimonia, which is translated as 'happiness' or 'flourishing' is an activity rather than an emotion or a state. Eudaimonia (Greek: Œµ·ΩêŒ¥Œ±ŒπŒºŒøŒΩŒØŒ±) is a classical Greek word consists of the word \\"eu\\" (\\"good\\" or \\"well being\\") and \\"daim≈çn\\" (\\"spirit\\" or \\"minor deity\\", used by extension to mean one's lot or fortune). Thus understood, the happy life is the good life, that is, a life in which a person fulfills human nature in an excellent way. Specifically, Aristotle argued that the good life is the life of excellent rational activity. He arrived at this claim with the \\"Function Argument\\". Basically, if it is right, every living thing has a function, that which it uniquely does. For Aristotle human function is to reason, since it is that alone which humans uniquely do. And performing one's function well, or excellently, is good. According to Aristotle, the life of excellent rational activity is the happy life. Aristotle argued a second best life for those incapable of excellent rational activity was the life of moral virtue. Western ethicists have made arguments for how humans should behave, either individually or collectively, based on the resulting happiness of such behavior. Utilitarians, such as John Stuart Mill and Jeremy Bentham, advocated the greatest happiness principle as a guide for ethical behavior. Friedrich Nietzsche critiqued the English Utilitarians' focus on attaining the greatest happiness, stating that \\"Man does not strive for happiness, only the Englishman does.\\" Nietzsche meant that making happiness one's ultimate goal and the aim of one's existence, in his words \\"makes one contemptible.\\" Nietzsche instead yearned for a culture that would set higher, more difficult goals than \\"mere happiness.\\" He introduced the quasi-dystopic figure of the \\"last man\\" as a kind of thought experiment against the utilitarians and happiness-seekers. these small, \\"last men\\" who seek after only their own pleasure and health, avoiding all danger, exertion, difficulty, challenge, struggle are meant to seem contemptible to Nietzsche's reader. Nietzsche instead wants us to consider the value of what is difficult, what can only be earned through struggle, difficulty, pain and thus to come to see the affirmative value suffering and unhappiness truly play in creating everything of great worth in life, including all the highest achievements of human culture, not least of all philosophy. In 2004 Darrin McMahon claimed, that over time the emphasis shifted from the happiness of virtue to the virtue of happiness. Not all cultures seek to maximise happiness,See the work of Jeanne TsaiSee Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness#Meaning of \\"happiness\\" ref. the meaning of the US Declaration of Independence phrase and some cultures are averse to happiness.  Religion =Eastern religions= Buddhism  Tibetan Buddhist monk Happiness forms a central theme of Buddhist teachings. For ultimate freedom from suffering, the Noble Eightfold Path leads its practitioner to Nirvana, a state of everlasting peace. Ultimate happiness is only achieved by overcoming craving in all forms. More mundane forms of happiness, such as acquiring wealth and maintaining good friendships, are also recognized as worthy goals for lay people (see sukha). Buddhism also encourages the generation of loving kindness and compassion, the desire for the happiness and welfare of all beings. Hinduism In Advaita Vedanta, the ultimate goal of life is happiness, in the sense that duality between Atman and Brahman is transcended and one realizes oneself to be the Self in all. Patanjali, author of the Yoga Sutras, wrote quite exhaustively on the psychological and ontological roots of bliss. Confucianism The Chinese Confucian thinker Mencius, who had sought to give advice to ruthless political leaders during China's Warring States period, was convinced that the mind played a mediating role between the \\"lesser self\\" (the physiological self) and the \\"greater self\\" (the moral self), and that getting the priorities right between these two would lead to sage-hood. He argued that if one did not feel satisfaction or pleasure in nourishing one's \\"vital force\\" with \\"righteous deeds\\", then that force would shrivel up (Mencius, 6A:15 2A:2). More specifically, he mentions the experience of intoxicating joy if one celebrates the practice of the great virtues, especially through music. =Abrahamic religions= Judaism  Happiness or simcha () in Judaism is considered an important element in the service of God.Yanklowitz, Shmuly. \\"Judaism's value of happiness living with gratitude and idealism.\\" Bloggish. The Jewish Journal. March 9, 2012. The biblical verse \\"worship The Lord with gladness; come before him with joyful songs,\\" () stresses joy in the service of God. A popular teaching by Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, a 19th-century Chassidic Rabbi, is \\"Mitzvah Gedolah Le'hiyot Besimcha Tamid,\\" it is a great mitzvah (commandment) to always be in a state of happiness. When a person is happy they are much more capable of serving God and going about their daily activities than when depressed or upset.Breslov.org. Accessed November 11, 2014.  Roman Catholicism  The primary meaning of \\"happiness\\" in various European languages involves good fortune, chance or happening. The meaning in Greek philosophy, however, refers primarily to ethics. In Catholicism, the ultimate end of human existence consists in felicity, Latin equivalent to the Greek eudaimonia, or \\"blessed happiness\\", described by the 13th-century philosopher-theologian Thomas Aquinas as a Beatific Vision of God's essence in the next life. According to St. Augustine and Thomas Aquinas, man's last end is happiness: \\"all men agree in desiring the last end, which is happiness.\\" However, where utilitarians focused on reasoning about consequences as the primary tool for reaching happiness, Aquinas agreed with Aristotle that happiness cannot be reached solely through reasoning about consequences of acts, but also requires a pursuit of good causes for acts, such as habits according to virtue. In turn, which habits and acts that normally lead to happiness is according to Aquinas caused by laws: natural law and divine law. These laws, in turn, were according to Aquinas caused by a first cause, or God. According to Aquinas, happiness consists in an \\"operation of the speculative intellect\\": \\"Consequently happiness consists principally in such an operation, viz. in the contemplation of Divine things.\\" And, \\"the last end cannot consist in the active life, which pertains to the practical intellect.\\" So: \\"Therefore the last and perfect happiness, which we await in the life to come, consists entirely in contemplation. But imperfect happiness, such as can be had here, consists first and principally in contemplation, but secondarily, in an operation of the practical intellect directing human actions and passions.\\" Human complexities, like reason and cognition, can produce well-being or happiness, but such form is limited and transitory. In temporal life, the contemplation of God, the infinitely Beautiful, is the supreme delight of the will. Beatitudo, or perfect happiness, as complete well-being, is to be attained not in this life, but the next. Islam Al-Ghazali (1058‚Äì1111), the Muslim Sufi thinker, wrote \\"The Alchemy of Happiness\\", a manual of spiritual instruction throughout the Muslim world and widely practiced today.  Methods for achieving happiness  Theories on how to achieve happiness include \\"encountering unexpected positive events\\", \\"seeing a significant other\\", and \\"basking in the acceptance and praise of others\\". However others believe that happiness is not solely derived from external, momentary pleasures. =Self-fulfilment theories= Woman kissing a baby on the cheek Maslow's hierarchy of needs Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a pyramid depicting the levels of human needs, psychological, and physical. When a human being ascends the steps of the pyramid, he reaches self-actualization. Beyond the routine of needs fulfillment, Maslow envisioned moments of extraordinary experience, known as peak experiences, profound moments of love, understanding, happiness, or rapture, during which a person feels more whole, alive, self-sufficient, and yet a part of the world. This is similar to the flow concept of Mih√°ly Cs√≠kszentmih√°lyi. Self-determination theory Smiling woman from Vietnam Self-determination theory relates intrinsic motivation to three needs: competence, autonomy, and relatedness. Modernization and freedom of choice Ronald Inglehart has traced cross- national differences in the level of happiness based on data from the World Values Survey. He finds that the extent to which a society allows free choice has a major impact on happiness. When basic needs are satisfied, the degree of happiness depends on economic and cultural factors that enable free choice in how people live their lives. Happiness also depends on religion in countries where free choice is constrained. =Positive psychology= Since 2000 the field of positive psychology has expanded drastically in terms of scientific publications, and has produced many different views on causes of happiness, and on factors that correlate with happiness. Numerous short-term self-help interventions have been developed and demonstrated to improve happiness. =Other approaches= Albert Camus said \\"You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.\\"Albert Camus, in \\"Intuitions\\" (October 1932), published in Youthful Writings (1976) John Stuart Mill believed that for the great majority of people happiness is best achieved en passant, rather than striving for it directly. This meant no self-consciousness, scrutiny, self-interrogation, dwelling on, thinking about, imagining or questioning on one's happiness. Then, if otherwise fortunately circumstanced, one would \\"inhale happiness with the air you breathe.\\"\\"The enjoyments of life (such was now my theory) are sufficient to make it a pleasant thing, when they are taken en passant, without being made a principal object. Once make them so, and they are immediately felt to be insufficient. They will not bear a scrutinizing examination. Ask yourself whether you are happy, and you cease to be so. The only chance is to treat, not happiness, but some end external to it, as the purpose of life. Let your self-consciousness, your scrutiny, your self- interrogation, exhaust themselves on that; and if otherwise fortunately circumstanced you will inhale happiness with the air you breathe, without dwelling on it or thinking about it, without either forestalling it in imagination, or putting it to flight by fatal questioning. This theory now became the basis of my philosophy of life. And I still hold to it as the best theory for all those who have but a moderate degree of sensibility and of capacity for enjoyment; that is, for the great majority of mankind.\\" Autobiography, Ch 5, https://www.gutenberg.org/files/10378/10378-h/10378-h.htm#link2H_NOTE https://www.laits.utexas.edu/poltheory/mill/auto/auto.c05.html William Inge observed that \\"on the whole, the happiest people seem to be those who have no particular cause for being happy except the fact that they are so.\\"A standalone comment in the 7 page essay entitled 'Happy People', dated 1921, which is included in Lay Thoughts of a Dean, (1926), p211, https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Hpw8KEtO7NkC&dq;=inauthor%3A%22William+Ralph+Inge%22&focus;=searchwithinvolume&q;=particular. https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.209347  Examining happiness Happiness can be examined in experiential and evaluative contexts. Experiential well-being, or \\"objective happiness\\", is happiness measured in the moment via questions such as \\"How good or bad is your experience now?\\". In contrast, evaluative well-being asks questions such as \\"How good was your vacation?\\" and measures one's subjective thoughts and feelings about happiness in the past. Experiential well-being is less prone to errors in reconstructive memory, but the majority of literature on happiness refers to evaluative well- being. The two measures of happiness can be related by heuristics such as the peak-end rule. Some commentators focus on the difference between the hedonistic tradition of seeking pleasant and avoiding unpleasant experiences, and the eudaimonic tradition of living life in a full and deeply satisfying way.  Measurement People have been trying to measure happiness for centuries. In 1780, the English utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham proposed that as happiness was the primary goal of humans it should be measured as a way of determining how well the government was performing. Several scales have been developed to measure happiness: * The Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS) is a four-item scale, measuring global subjective happiness from 1999. The scale requires participants to use absolute ratings to characterize themselves as happy or unhappy individuals, as well as it asks to what extent they identify themselves with descriptions of happy and unhappy individuals. * The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) from 1988 is a 20-item questionnaire, using a five-point Likert scale (1 = very slightly or not at all, 5 = extremely) to assess the relation between personality traits and positive or negative affects at \\"this moment, today, the past few days, the past week, the past few weeks, the past year, and in general\\". A longer version with additional affect scales was published 1994. * The Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) is a global cognitive assessment of life satisfaction developed by Ed Diener. A seven-point Likert scale is used to agree or disagree with five statements about one's life. * The Cantril ladder method has been used in the World Happiness Report. Respondents are asked to think of a ladder, with the best possible life for them being a 10, and the worst possible life being a 0. They are then asked to rate their own current lives on that 0 to 10 scale. * Positive Experience; the survey by Gallup asks if, the day before, people experienced enjoyment, laughing or smiling a lot, feeling well-rested, being treated with respect, learning or doing something interesting. 9 of the top 10 countries in 2018 were South American, led by Paraguay and Panama. Country scores range from 85 to 43. Since 2012, a World Happiness Report has been published. Happiness is evaluated, as in ‚ÄúHow happy are you with your life as a whole?‚Äù, and in emotional reports, as in ‚ÄúHow happy are you now?,‚Äù and people seem able to use happiness as appropriate in these verbal contexts. Using these measures, the report identifies the countries with the highest levels of happiness. In subjective well-being measures, the primary distinction is between cognitive life evaluations and emotional reports. The UK began to measure national well being in 2012, following Bhutan, which had already been measuring gross national happiness. Happiness has been found to be quite stable over time. Relationship to physical characteristics As of 2016, no evidence of happiness causing improved physical health has been found; the topic is being researched at the Lee Kum Sheung Center for Health and Happiness at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. A positive relationship has been suggested between the volume of the brain's gray matter in the right precuneus area and one's subjective happiness score. Possible limits on happiness seeking Some studies, including 2018 work by June Gruber a psychologist at University of Colorado, has suggested that seeking happiness can have negative effects, such as failure to meet over-high expectations. A 2012 study found that psychological well-being was higher for people who experienced both positive and negative emotions.Also https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256542618_When_Feeling_Bad_Can_Be_Good_Mixed_Emotions_Benefit_Physical_Health_Across_Adulthood Other research has analysed possible trade-offs between happiness and meaning in life. Not all cultures seek to maximise happiness. Sigmund Freud said that all humans strive after happiness, but that the possibilities of achieving it are restricted because we \\"are so made that we can derive intense enjoyment only from a contrast and very little from the state of things.\\"Freud, S. Civilization and its discontents. Translated and edited by James Strachey, Chapter II. New York: W. W. Norton. [Originally published in 1930].  Economic and political views  officers celebrate their new positions by throwing their midshipmen covers into the air as part of the U.S. Naval Academy class of 2011 graduation and commissioning ceremony. In politics, happiness as a guiding ideal is expressed in the United States Declaration of Independence of 1776, written by Thomas Jefferson, as the universal right to \\"the pursuit of happiness.\\" This seems to suggest a subjective interpretation but one that goes beyond emotions alone. It has to be kept in mind that the word happiness meant \\"prosperity, thriving, wellbeing\\" in the 18th century and not the same thing as it does today. In fact, happiness . Common market health measures such as GDP and GNP have been used as a measure of successful policy. On average richer nations tend to be happier than poorer nations, but this effect seems to diminish with wealth. This has been explained by the fact that the dependency is not linear but logarithmic, i.e., the same percentual increase in the GNP produces the same increase in happiness for wealthy countries as for poor countries. Increasingly, academic economists and international economic organisations are arguing for and developing multi- dimensional dashboards which combine subjective and objective indicators to provide a more direct and explicit assessment of human wellbeing. Work by Paul Anand and colleagues helps to highlight the fact that there many different contributors to adult wellbeing, that happiness judgement reflect, in part, the presence of salient constraints, and that fairness, autonomy, community and engagement are key aspects of happiness and wellbeing throughout the life course. Libertarian think tank Cato Institute claims that economic freedom correlates strongly with happinessIn Pursuit of Happiness Research. Is It Reliable? What Does It Imply for Policy? The Cato institute. April 11, 2007 preferably within the context of a western mixed economy, with free press and a democracy. According to certain standards, East European countries when ruled by Communist parties were less happy than Western ones, even less happy than other equally poor countries.The Scientist's Pursuit of Happiness , Policy, Spring 2005. Since 2003, empirical research in the field of happiness economics, such as that by Benjamin Radcliff, professor of Political Science at the University of Notre Dame, supported the contention that in democratic countries life satisfaction is strongly and positively related to the social democratic model of a generous social safety net, pro-worker labor market regulations, and strong labor unions.Radcliff, Benjamin (2013) The Political Economy of Human Happiness (New York: Cambridge University Press). See also this collection of full-text peer reviewed scholarly articles on this subject by Radcliff and colleagues (from \\"Social Forces,\\" \\"The Journal of Politics,\\" and \\"Perspectives on Politics,\\" among others) Similarly, there is evidence that public policies which reduce poverty and support a strong middle class, such as a higher minimum wage, strongly affect average levels of well-being. It has been argued that happiness measures could be used not as a replacement for more traditional measures, but as a supplement. According to the Cato institute, people constantly make choices that decrease their happiness, because they have also more important aims. Therefore, government should not decrease the alternatives available for the citizen by patronizing them but let the citizen keep a maximal freedom of choice.Coercive regulation and the balance of freedom , Edward Glaeser, Cato Unbound 11.5.2007 Good mental health and good relationships contribute more than income to happiness and governments should take these into account.Mental health and relationships 'key to happiness' BBC Contributing factors and research outcomes Research on positive psychology, well-being, eudaimonia and happiness, and the theories of Diener, Ryff, Keyes, and Seligmann covers a broad range of levels and topics, including \\"the biological, personal, relational, institutional, cultural, and global dimensions of life.\\"  See also  References  Further reading  * Anand Paul \\"Happiness Explained: What Human Flourishing Is and What We Can Do to Promote It\\", Oxford: Oxford University Press 2016. * Michael Argyle \\"The psychology of happiness\\", 1987 Norman M.

The group began their musical career as Girl's Tyme, formed in 1990 in Houston, Texas. After years of limited success, the quartet comprising Knowles, Rowland, LaTavia Roberson, and LeToya Luckett were signed in 1997 to Columbia Records as Destiny's Child. The group was launched into mainstream recognition following the release of their best-selling second album, The Writing's on the Wall (1999), which contained the number-one singles \\"Bills, Bills, Bills\\" and \\"Say My Name\\". Despite critical and commercial success, the group was plagued by internal conflict and legal turmoil, as Roberson and Luckett attempted to split from the group's manager Mathew Knowles, citing favoritism of Knowles and Rowland. In early 2000, both Roberson and Luckett were replaced with Williams and Farrah Franklin; however, Franklin quit after five months, leaving the group as a trio. Their third album, Survivor (2001), whose themes the public interpreted as a channel to the group's experience, produced the worldwide hits \\"Independent Women\\", \\"Survivor\\" and \\"Bootylicious\\". In 2001, they announced a hiatus to pursue solo careers. The trio reunited two years later for the release of their fifth and final studio album, Destiny Fulfilled (2004), which spawned the international hits \\"Lose My Breath\\" and \\"Soldier\\". Since the group's official disbandment in 2006, Knowles, Rowland, and Williams have reunited a couple of times, including at the 2013 Super Bowl halftime show and 2018 Coachella festival. Destiny's Child has sold more than sixty million records worldwide to date. Billboard ranks the group as one of the greatest musical trios of all time, the ninth most successful artist/band of the 2000s, placed the group 68th in its All-Time Hot 100 Artists list in 2008 and in December 2016, the magazine ranked them as the 90th most successful dance club artist of all-time. The group was nominated for 14 Grammy Awards, winning twice for Best R&B; Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and once for Best R&B; Song. History=1990‚Äì1997: Early beginnings and Girl's Tyme= In 1990, Beyonc√© Knowles met rapper LaTavia Roberson while auditioning for a girl group. Based in Houston, Texas, they were joined to a group that performed rapping and dancing. Kelly Rowland, who relocated to Knowles' house because of family issues, joined them in 1992. Originally named Girl's Tyme, they were eventually cut down to six members including T√°mar Davis and sisters Nikki and Nina Taylor. With Knowles and Rowland, Girl's Tyme attracted nationwide attention: west-coast R&B; producer Arne Frager flew to Houston to see them. He brought them to his studio, The Plant Recording Studios, in Northern California, with focus on Knowles' vocals because Frager thought she had personality and the ability to sing. With efforts to sign Girl's Tyme to a major record deal, Frager's strategy was to debut the group in Star Search, the biggest talent show on national TV at the time. However, they lost the competition because, according to Knowles, their choice of song was wrong; they were actually rapping instead of singing. Because of the group's defeat, Knowles' father, Mathew, voluntarily dedicated his time to manage them. Mathew Knowles decided to cut the original lineup to four, with the removal of Davis and the Taylor sisters and the inclusion of LeToya Luckett in 1993. Aside from spending time at their church in Houston, Girl's Tyme practiced in their backyards and at Headliners Salon, owned by Knowles' mother, Tina. The group would test routines in the salon, when it was on Montrose Boulevard in Houston, and sometimes would collect tips from the customers. Their try out would be critiqued by the people inside. During their school days, Girl's Tyme performed at local gigs. When summer came, Mathew Knowles established a \\"boot camp\\" to train them in dance and vocal lessons. After rigorous training, they began performing as opening acts for established R&B; groups of that time such as SWV, Dru Hill and Immature. Tina Knowles designed the group's attire for their performances. Over the course of the early years in their career, Girl's Tyme changed their name to Something Fresh, Clich√©, the Dolls, and to Destiny. The group signed with Elektra Records with the name Destiny, but were dropped several months later before they could release an album. The pursuit of a record deal affected the Knowles family: in 1995, Mathew Knowles resigned from his job as a medical-equipment salesman, a move that reduced Knowles' family's income by half, and her parents briefly separated due to the pressure. In 1996, they changed their name to Destiny's Child. Though group members have claimed that the name was taken from a passage in the Book of Isaiah, the phrase does not appear in any published English translation of the Bible, and more likely originated in the 1967 Waylon Jennings song of the same name. Mathew Knowles helped in negotiating a record deal with Columbia Records, which signed the group that same year. Prior to signing with Columbia, the group had recorded several tracks in Oakland, California produced by D'wayne Wiggins of Tony! Toni! Ton√©!. Upon the label's recognition that Destiny's Child had a \\"unique quality\\", the track \\"Killing Time\\" was included in the soundtrack to the 1997 film Men in Black. =1997‚Äì2000: Breakthrough and lineup changes= Wyclef Jean remixed the song \\"No, No, No\\", which became Destiny's Child's first successful single. Destiny's Child first charted in November 1997 with \\"No, No, No\\", the lead single from their self-titled debut album, which was released in the United States on February 17, 1998, featuring productions by Tim & Bob, Rob Fusari, Jermaine Dupri, Wyclef Jean, Dwayne Wiggins and Corey Rooney. Destiny's Child peaked at number sixty-seven on the Billboard 200 and number fourteen on the Billboard Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums. It managed to sell over one million copies in the United States, earning a platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The remix version to \\"No, No, No\\", reached number one on the Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks and number three on the Billboard Hot 100. Its follow-up single, \\"With Me Part 1\\" failed to reproduce the success of \\"No, No, No\\". Meanwhile, the group featured on a song from the soundtrack album of the romantic drama Why Do Fools Fall in Love and \\"Get on the Bus\\" had a limited release in Europe and other markets. In 1998, Destiny's Child garnered three Soul Train Lady of Soul awards including Best New Artist for \\"No, No, No\\". Knowles considered their debut successful but not huge, claiming as a neo soul record it was too mature for the group at the time. After the success of their debut album, Destiny's Child re-entered the studio quickly, bringing in a new lineup of producers, including Kevin \\"She'kspere\\" Briggs and Rodney Jerkins. Coming up with The Writing's on the Wall, they released it on July 27, 1999 and it eventually became their breakthrough album. The Writing's on the Wall peaked at number five on the Billboard 200 and number two on R&B; chart in early 2000. \\"Bills, Bills, Bills\\" was released in 1999 as the album's lead single and reached the top spot of the Billboard Hot 100, becoming their first US number-one single. The Writing's on the Wall has been credited as Destiny's Child's breakthrough album, spurring their career and introducing them to a wider audience. Michelle Williams joined the group as a replacement for Luckett and Roberson. In December 1999, Luckett and Roberson attempted to split with their manager, claiming that he kept a disproportionate share of the group's profits and unfairly favored Knowles and Rowland. While they never intended to leave the group, when the video for \\"Say My Name\\", the third single from The Writing's on the Wall, surfaced in February 2000, Roberson and Luckett found out that two new members were joining Knowles and Rowland. Prior to the video premiere, Knowles announced on TRL that original members Luckett and Roberson had left the group. They were replaced by Michelle Williams, a former backup singer to Monica, and Farrah Franklin, an aspiring singer- actress. Shortly after her stint with Monica, Williams was introduced to Destiny's Child by choreographer Braden Larson aka \\"Peanut Orlando\\", and was flown to Houston where she stayed with the Knowles family. In March 2000, Roberson and Luckett filed a lawsuit against Mathew Knowles and their former bandmates for breach of partnership and fiduciary duties. Following the suit, both sides were disparaging towards each other in the media. Five months after joining, Franklin left the group. The remaining members claimed that this was due to missed promotional appearances and concerts. According to Williams, Franklin could not handle stress. Franklin, however, disclosed that she left because of the negativity surrounding the strife and her inability to assert any control in the decision making. Her departure was seen as less controversial. Williams, on the other hand, disclosed that her inclusion in the group resulted in her \\"battling insecurity\\": \\"I was comparing myself to the other members, and the pressure was on me.\\" Towards the end of 2000, Roberson and Luckett dropped the portion of their lawsuit aimed at Rowland and Knowles in exchange for a settlement, though they continued the action against their manager. As part of the agreement, both sides were prohibited from speaking about each other publicly. Roberson and Luckett formed another girl group named Anjel but also left it due to issues with the record company. Although band members were affected by the turmoil, the publicity made Destiny's Child's success even bigger and they became a pop culture phenomenon. \\"Say My Name\\" topped the Billboard Hot 100 for three consecutive weeks, while the fourth single, \\"Jumpin', Jumpin'\\", also became a top-ten hit. The Writing's on the Wall eventually sold over eight million copies in the United States, gaining eight-time platinum certification by the RIAA. The album sold more than 11 million copies worldwide and was one of the top- selling albums of 2000. During this time, Destiny's Child began performing as an opening act at the concerts of pop singers Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. With Williams in the new lineup, Destiny's Child released a theme song for the soundtrack to the 2000 film Charlie's Angels. Released as a single in October 2000, \\"Independent Women Part 1\\" spent eleven consecutive weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 from November 2000 to January 2001, the longest-running number-one single of Destiny's Child's career and of that year in the United States. The successful release of the single boosted the sales of the soundtrack album to Charlie's Angels to 1.5 million by 2001. In 2000, Destiny's Child won Soul Train's Sammy Davis Jr. Entertainer of the Year award. =2000‚Äì2003: Survivor, subsequent releases, hiatus and side projects= At the 2001 Billboard Music Awards, Destiny's Child won several accolades, including Artist of the Year and Duo/Group of the Year, and again won Artist of the Year among five awards they snagged in 2001. In September 2000, the group took home two at the sixth annual Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards, including R&B;/Soul Album of the Year, Group for The Writing's on the Wall. Destiny's Child recorded their third album, Survivor, from mid-2000 until early 2001. In the production process, Knowles assumed more control in co-producing and co-writing almost the entire album. Survivor hit record stores in the spring of 2001 and entered the Billboard 200 at number one, selling over 663,000 copies in its first week sales. The first three singles, \\"Independent Women Part I\\", \\"Survivor\\" and \\"Bootylicious\\" reached the top three in the United States and were also successful in other countries; the first two were consecutive number-one singles in the United Kingdom. The album was certified four-time platinum in the United States and double platinum in Australia. It sold 6 million copies as of July 27, 2001. In the wake of the September 11 attacks, Destiny's Child canceled a European tour and performed in a concert benefit for the survivors. In October 2001, the group released a holiday album, 8 Days of Christmas, which contained updated versions of several Christmas songs. The album managed to reach number thirty-four on the Billboard 200. In February 2001, Destiny's Child won two Grammy awards for \\"Say My Name\\": Best R&B; Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group and Best R&B; Song. They also earned an American Music Award for Favorite Soul/R&B; Band/Duo. Also in 2001, Destiny's Child sang backup vocals for Solange Knowles, who was the lead, on the theme song to the animated Disney Channel series The Proud Family. In March 2002, a remix compilation titled This Is the Remix was released to win fans over before a new studio album would be released. The remix album reached number 29 in the United States. The lead single \\"Survivor\\" was by some interpreted as a response to the strife between the band members, although Knowles claimed it was not directed at anybody. Seeing it as a breach of the agreement that barred each party from public disparagement, Roberson and Luckett once again filed a lawsuit against Destiny's Child and Sony Music, shortly following the release of This Is the Remix. In June 2002, remaining cases were settled in court. Solange, who had recorded songs and performed with Destiny's Child, was reported to join the group when they reunite, but this was later confirmed as only a test of the public's reaction. In late 2000, Destiny's Child announced their plan to embark on individual side projects, including releases of solo albums, an idea by their manager. In 2002, Williams released her solo album, Heart to Yours, a contemporary gospel collection. The album reached number one on the Billboard Top Gospel Albums chart. In the same date Heart to Yours hit stores, Destiny's Child released their official autobiography, Soul Survivors. Rowland collaborated with hip hop artist Nelly on \\"Dilemma\\", which became a worldwide hit and earned Rowland a Grammy; she became the first member of Destiny's Child to have achieved a US number-one single. In the same year, Knowles co- starred with Mike Myers in the box-office hit Austin Powers in Goldmember. She recorded her first solo single, \\"Work It Out\\", for the film's soundtrack. To capitalize on the success of \\"Dilemma\\", Rowland's solo debut album Simply Deep was brought forward from its early 2003 release to September 2002. Rowland's career took off internationally when Simply Deep hit number one on the UK Albums Chart. In the same year, she made her feature film debut in the horror film Freddy vs. Jason. Meanwhile, Knowles made her second film, The Fighting Temptations, and appeared as featured vocalist on her then-boyfriend Jay-Z's single \\"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\\", which paved the way for the release of her debut solo album. As an upshot from the success of \\"Dilemma\\", Knowles' debut album, Dangerously in Love, was postponed many times until June 2003. Knowles was considered the most successful among the three solo releases. Dangerously in Love debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 317,000 copies. It yielded the number-one hits \\"Crazy in Love\\", and \\"Baby Boy\\"; and the top-five singles \\"Me, Myself and I\\" and \\"Naughty Girl\\". The album was certified 4x platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It remains as Knowles' best-selling album to date, with sales of 5 million copies in the United States, as of June 2016. Worldwide, the album has sold more than eleven million copies. Knowles' solo debut was well received by critics, earning five Grammy awards in one night for Dangerously in Love, tying the likes of Norah Jones, Lauryn Hill, and Alicia Keys for most Grammys received in one night by a female artist. In November 2003, Williams appeared as Aida on Broadway. In January 2004, she released her second gospel album, Do You Know. D'wayne Wiggins, who had produced their first recordings as Destiny's Child, filed suit in 2002 against his former counsel (Bloom, Hergott, Diemer & Cook LLP) seeking $15 million in damages for lessening his contractual agreement with the group without his consent, effectively nullifying his original contract that offered Sony Music/Columbia Destiny's Child's exclusive recording services for an initial seven years, in exchange for \\"certain royalties\\", instead of royalties only from the first three albums. The case was settled for an undisclosed amount. In June 2003, Mathew Knowles announced that Destiny's Child would expand back to a quartet, revealing Knowles' younger sister, Solange, as the latest addition to the group. Destiny's Child had previously recorded songs with Solange and shared the stage when she temporarily replaced Rowland after she broke her toes while performing. Their manager, however, said the idea was used to test reactions from the public. In August 2003, Knowles herself confirmed that her sister would not be joining in the group, and instead promoted Solange's debut album, Solo Star, released in January 2003. =2003‚Äì2006: Destiny Fulfilled and #1's= Three years after the hiatus, members of Destiny's Child reunited to record their fourth and final studio album, Destiny Fulfilled. The album introduces the trio to a harder, \\"urban\\" sound, and songs featured are conceptually interrelated. Destiny Fulfilled saw equality in the trio: each member contributed to writing on the majority songs, as well as becoming executive producers aside from their manager. Released on November 15, 2004, Destiny Fulfilled failed to top Survivor; the album reached number two the following week, selling 497,000 copies in its first week, compared to 663,000 for the previous album. Certified three-time platinum in the United States, it was still one of the best-selling albums of 2005, selling over eight million copies worldwide; it pushed the group back into the position of the best-selling female group and American group of the year. Four singles were released from the album: the lead \\"Lose My Breath\\", \\"Soldier\\", \\"Cater 2 U\\" and \\"Girl\\"; the first two reached number three in the United States. \\"Soldier\\" \\"Cater 2 U\\" were certified platinum by the RIAA in 2006. The final line-up of Destiny's Child performing during their 2005 Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It concert tour. To promote the album, Destiny's Child embarked on their worldwide concert tour, Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It Tour. On June 11, 2005, while at the Palau Sant Jordi in Barcelona, Spain, the group announced to the audience of 16,000 people that they planned to officially break up once the tour concluded. Knowles stated that the albumn's title Destiny Fulfilled was not a coincidence and reflected the fact that the breakup was already being planned when the album was being recorded. While making the album, they planned to part ways after their fourteen-year career as a group to facilitate their continued pursuit in individual aspirations. Knowles stated that their destinies were already fulfilled. The group sent a letter to MTV about the decision, saying: > We have been working together as Destiny's Child since we were 9, and > touring together since we were 14. After a lot of discussion and some deep > soul searching, we realized that our current tour has given us the > opportunity to leave Destiny's Child on a high note, united in our > friendship and filled with an overwhelming gratitude for our music, our > fans, and each other. After all these wonderful years working together, we > realized that now is the time to pursue our personal goals and solo efforts > in earnest...No matter what happens, we will always love each other as > friends and sisters and will always support each other as artists. We want > to thank all of our fans for their incredible love and support and hope to > see you all again as we continue fulfilling our destinies. > ‚ÄîDestiny's Child, MTV Destiny's Child released their greatest hits album, #1's, on October 25, 2005. The compilation includes their number-one hits including \\"Independent Woman Part 1\\", \\"Say My Name\\" and \\"Bootylicious\\". Three new tracks were recorded for the compilation including \\"Stand Up for Love\\", which was recorded for the theme song to the World Children's Day, and \\"Check on It\\", a song Knowles recorded for The Pink Panthers soundtrack. Record producer David Foster, his daughter Amy Foster-Gillies and Knowles wrote \\"Stand Up for Love\\" as the anthem to the World Children's Day, an annual worldwide event to raise awareness and funds for children causes. Over the past three years, more than $50 million have been raised to benefit Ronald McDonald House Charities and other children's organizations. Destiny's Child lent their voices and support as global ambassadors for the 2005 program. #1's was also released as a DualDisc, featuring the same track listing, seven videos of selected songs and a trailer of the concert DVD Destiny's Child: Live in Atlanta. The DVD was filmed during the Atlanta visit of the Destiny Fulfilled ... And Lovin' It tour, and was released on March 28, 2006. It has been certified platinum by the RIAA, denoting shipments of over one million units. Notwithstanding the album title, only five of the album's 16 tracks had reached #1 on either the Billboard Hot 100 or the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs chart; writer Keith Caulfield of Billboard magazine suggested that the title was \\"a marketing angle\\". Despite this, journalist Chris Harris of MTV said that the album \\"lives up to its name\\". Disbandment and aftermath Destiny's Child reunited for a farewell performance at the 2006 NBA All-Star Game on February 19, 2006 in Houston, Texas; however, Knowles commented, \\"It's the last album, but it's not the last show.\\" Their final televised performance was at the Fashion Rocks benefit concert in New York a few days later. On March 28, 2006, Destiny's Child was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the 2,035th recipient of the coveted recognition. At the 2006 BET Awards, Destiny's Child won Best Group, a category they also earned in 2005 and 2001. After their formal disbandment, all members resumed their solo careers and have each experienced different levels of success. Since then, Knowles, Rowland and Williams have continued to collaborate on each other's solo projects through song features, music video appearances, and live performances. Both Rowland and Williams, along with Knowles' sister Solange, appeared in Knowles' music video for her single \\"Get Me Bodied\\" (2007). On June 26, 2007, the group made a mini-reunion at the 2007 BET Awards, where Knowles performed \\"Get Me Bodied\\" with Williams and Solange as her back-up dancers. After her performance, Knowles introduced Rowland who performed her single \\"Like This\\" (2007) with Eve. On the September 2, 2007 Los Angeles stop of The Beyonc√© Experience tour, Knowles sang a snippet of \\"Survivor\\" with Rowland and Williams, and the latter two rendered a \\"Happy Birthday\\" song to Knowles. The performance was featured in Knowles' tour DVD, The Beyonc√© Experience Live. In 2008, Knowles recorded a cover of Billy Joel's \\"Honesty\\" for Destiny's Child's compilation album Mathew Knowles & Music World Present Vol.1: Love Destiny, which was released only in Japan to celebrate the group's tenth anniversary. Rowland made a cameo appearance in Knowles' music video for her single \\"Party\\" (2011), and the group's third compilation album, Playlist: The Very Best of Destiny's Child, was released in 2012 to mark the fifteenth anniversary since their formation. The fourth compilation album, Love Songs, was released on January 29, 2013, and included the newly recorded song \\"Nuclear\\", produced by Pharrell Williams. \\"Nuclear\\" marked the first original music from Destiny's Child in eight years. The following month, Rowland and Williams appeared as special guests for Knowles' Super Bowl XLVII halftime show, where they performed \\"Bootylicious\\", \\"Independent Women\\" and Knowles' own song \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\". A video album titled Destiny's Child Video Anthology was released in May 2013 and featured sixteen of the group's music videos. Knowles and Williams were then featured on Rowland's song \\"You Changed\\" from her fourth solo album Talk a Good Game (2013). Later that year, Rowland and Williams made cameo appearances in the music videos for Knowles' songs \\"Superpower\\" and \\"Grown Woman\\", which were both included on her self-titled fifth solo visual album. Williams released the single \\"Say Yes\\" in June 2014, featuring Knowles and Rowland. They performed \\"Say Yes\\" together during the 2015 Stellar Awards, and the live version of the song was mastered for iTunes in April 2015. On November 7, 2016, the group reunited in a video to try the Mannequin Challenge, which was posted on Rowland's official Instagram account. The group reunited for Beyonc√©'s headline performance at Coachella in April 2018. Artistry=Musical style and themes= Destiny's Child recorded R&B; songs with styles that encompasses urban, contemporary, and dance-pop. In the group's original line-up, Knowles was the lead vocalist, Rowland was the second lead vocalist, Luckett was on soprano, and Roberson was on alto. Knowles remained as the lead vocalist in the group's final line-up as a trio, however, Rowland and Williams also took turns in singing lead for the majority of their songs. Destiny's Child cited R&B; singer Janet Jackson as one of their influences. Ann Powers of The New York Times described Destiny's Child music as \\"fresh and emotional ... these ladies have the best mixes, the savviest samples and especially the most happening beats.\\" In the same publication, Jon Pareles noted that the sound that defines Destiny's Child, aside from Knowles' voice, \\"is the way its melodies jump in and out of double- time. Above brittle, syncopated rhythm tracks, quickly articulated verses alternate with smoother choruses.\\" The group usually harmonize their vocals in their songs, especially on the ballads. In most instances of their songs, each member sings one verse and chimes in at the chorus. In their third album Survivor (2001), each member sings lead in the majority of the songs. Knowles said, \\"... everybody is a part of the music ... Everybody is singing lead on every song, and it's so great‚Äîbecause now Destiny's Child is at the point vocally and mentally that it should be at.\\" Knowles, however, completely led songs like \\"Brown Eyes\\" and \\"Dangerously in Love 2\\". The group explored their lyrics to man-to-woman relationship, sisterhood and female empowerment anthems. Survivor contains themes interpreted by the public as a reference to the group's internal conflict. The title track, \\"Survivor\\", which set the theme used throughout the album, features the lyrics \\"I'm not gonna blast you on the radio ... I'm not gonna lie on you or your family ... I'm not gonna hate you in the magazine\\" caused Roberson and Luckett to file a lawsuit against the group; the lyrics were perceived to be a violation over their agreement following a settlement in court. In an interview, Knowles commented: \\"The lyrics to the single 'Survivor' are Destiny's Child's story, because we've been through a lot, ... We went through our drama with the members ... Any complications we've had in our 10-year period of time have made us closer and tighter and better.\\" In another song called \\"Fancy\\", which contains the lyrics \\"You always tried to compete with me, girl ... find your own identity\\", was interpreted by critic David Browne, in his review of the album for Entertainment Weekly magazine, as a response to the lawsuit. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic summarized Survivor as \\"a determined, bullheaded record, intent on proving Destiny's Child has artistic merit largely because the group survived internal strife. ... It's a record that tries to be a bold statement of purpose, but winds up feeling forced and artificial.\\" Despite the album's receiving critical praise, Knowles' close involvement has occasionally generated criticism. Knowles wrote and co-produced the bulk of Survivor. Browne suggested that her help made Survivor a \\"premature, but inevitable, growing pains album\\". In the majority of the songs on their final studio album Destiny Fulfilled (2004), the verses are divided into three sections, with Knowles singing first, followed by Rowland, then Williams; the three harmonize together during the choruses. =Public image= Diana Ross (pictured), lead singer of The Supremes, whom Beyonc√© was compared to. Destiny's Child were compared to The Supremes, a 1960s American female singing group, with Knowles being compared to Supremes frontwoman Diana Ross; Knowles, however, has dismissed the notion. Coincidentally, Knowles starred in the film adaptation of the 1981 Broadway musical Dreamgirls as Deena Jones, the front woman of the Dreams, a female singing group based on the Supremes. With Knowles' wide role assumed in the production of Survivor, Gil Kaufman of MTV noted that \\"it became clear that Beyonc√© was emerging as DC's unequivocal musical leader and public face\\". Her dominance to the creative input in the album made the album \\"very much her work\\". For Lola Ogunnaike of The New York Times, \\"It's been a long-held belief in the music industry that Destiny's Child was little more than a launching pad for Beyonc√© Knowles' inevitable solo career.\\" In the wake of Knowles' debut solo album Dangerously in Love (2003), rumors spread about a possible split of Destiny's Child after each member had experienced solo success and had ongoing projects. Comparisons were drawn to Justin Timberlake, who did not return to band NSYNC after his breakthrough debut solo album, Justified. Rowland responded to such rumors, announcing they were back in the studio together. The group claimed that the reunion was destined to happen and that their affinity to each other kept them cohesive. Margeaux Watson, arts editor at Suede magazine, suggested that Knowles \\"does not want to appear disloyal to her former partners,\\" and called her decision to return to the group \\"a charitable one\\". Knowles' mother, Tina, wrote a 2002-published book, titled Destiny's Style: Bootylicious Fashion, Beauty and Lifestyle Secrets From Destiny's Child, an account of how fashion influenced Destiny's Child's success. Legacy Destiny's Child's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Destiny's Child have been referred to as R&B; icons, and have sold more than 60 million records worldwide. Following the disbandment of Destiny's Child, MTV's James Montgomery noted that \\"they have left a fairly sizable legacy behind\\" as \\"one of the best-selling female pop vocal groups in history.\\" Billboard observed that Destiny's Child were \\"defined by a combination of feisty female empowerment anthems, killer dance moves and an enviable fashion sense,\\" while Essence noted that they \\"set trends with their harmonious music and cutting-edge style.\\" In 2015, Daisy Jones of Dazed Digital published an article on how the group made a significant impact in R&B; music, writing \\"Without a hint of rose tint, Destiny's Child legitimately transformed the sound of R&B; forever... their distinct influence can be found peppered all over today's pop landscape, from Tinashe to Ariana Grande.\\" Nicole Marrow of The Cut magazine believed that R&B; music in the 1990s and early 2000s \\"was virtually redefined by the success of powerhouse performers like TLC and Destiny's Child, who preached a powerful litany of embracing womanhood and celebrating individuality.\\" Hugh McIntyre of Forbes wrote that before The Pussycat Dolls and Danity Kane burst onto the music scene in the mid-2000s, Destiny's Child were \\"the reigning queens\\" of the girl group genre. Writing for Pitchfork, Katherine St. Asaph noticed how Destiny's Child defined the revival of girl groups similar to The Supremes in the early-to-mid-'90s, saying: > There is no better microcosm of what happened to Top 40 music between 1993 > and 1999 than this. Bands like the ‚ÄúStar Search‚Äù winner were buried in a > landfill of post-grunge, while R&B; groups built out from soul and quiet > storm to create a sound innovative enough to earn the ‚Äúfuturistic‚Äù label > almost everything got in that pre-Y2K time. This bore itself out in the > revival in the early-to-mid-‚Äô90s of excellent girl groups vaguely in the > Supremes mold‚ÄîTLC, En Vogue, SWV‚Äîbut it would be Destiny‚Äôs Child who would > become their true successors. Destiny's Child's final line-up as a trio has been widely noted as the group's most recognizable and successful line-up. Billboard recognized them as one of the greatest musical trios of all time; they were also ranked as the third most successful girl group of all time on the Billboard charts, behind TLC and The Supremes. The group's single \\"Independent Women\\" (2000) ranked second on Billboards list of the \\"Top 40 Biggest Girl Group Songs of All Time on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart\\". \\"Independent Women\\" was also acknowledged by the Guinness World Records as the longest-running number-one song on the Hot 100 by a girl group. The term \\"Bootylicious\\" (a combination of the words booty and delicious) became popularized by Destiny's Child's single of the same and was later added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2006. The term was also used to describe Beyonc√© during the 2000s decade due to her curvaceous figure. VH1 included \\"Bootylicious\\" on their \\"100 Greatest Songs of the '00s\\" list in 2011, and Destiny's Child on their \\"100 Greatest Women in Music\\" list the following year. Additionally, \\"Independent Women\\" was ranked as one of NMEs \\"100 Best Songs of the 00s\\". Destiny's Child was honored at the 2005 World Music Awards with the World's Best Selling Female Group of All Time Award, which included a 17-minute tribute performance by Patti LaBelle, Usher, Babyface, Rihanna, Amerie and Teairra Mari. In 2006, the group was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Destiny's Child has been credited as a musical influence or inspiration by several artists including Rihanna, Meghan Trainor, Fifth Harmony, Little Mix, Girls Aloud, Haim, Jess Glynne, Katy B, and RichGirl. Ciara was inspired to pursue a career in music after seeing Destiny's Child perform on television. Ariana Grande cited Destiny's Child as one of her vocal inspirations, saying that listening to the group's music is how she discovered her range and \\"learned about harmonies and runs and ad- libs.\\" Meghan Trainor stated that her single \\"No\\" (2016) was inspired by the late 1990s and early 2000s sounds of Destiny's Child, NSYNC, and Britney Spears. Fifth Harmony cited Destiny's Child as their biggest inspiration, and even paid tribute to the group by performing a medley of \\"Say My Name\\", \\"Independent Women\\", \\"Bootylicious\\" and \\"Survivor\\" on the television show Greatest Hits. Fifth Harmony also incorporated elements of the intro from \\"Bootylicious\\" for the intro to their own song \\"Brave, Honest, Beautiful\\" (2015).

The village is north of Salzburg, and is east of the Inn river, which forms part of the German border. Despite having a population of only 104 in 2005, the village has drawn attention in the English-speaking world for its place-name, which is spelled the same as an inflected form of the profane English-language verb \\"fuck\\". Its road signs are a popular visitor attraction, and they were often stolen by souvenir-hunting vandals until 2005, when the signs were modified to be theft- resistant.  History  It is believed that the settlement was founded in the 6th century AD by Focko, a Bavarian nobleman. The Austrian region during this century was mostly under the domain of the Kingdom of the Ostrogoths, and was populated by a mix of Christians and Pagans. The existence of the village was documented for the first time in 1070, and historical records show that some twenty years later, the lord was recorded in Latin as Adalpertus de Fucingin. The spelling of the name has evolved over the years; it is first recorded in historical sources with the spelling as Vucchingen in 1070, Fukching in 1303, Fugkhing in 1532, and in the modern spelling Fucking in the 18th century, which is pronounced with the vowel oo as in book. The ending -ing is an old Germanic suffix indicating the people belonging to the root word to which it is attached, thus Fucking means \\"(place of) Focko's people.\\"\\"Brits steal carloads of F**king Austrian roadsigns\\", The Register, 15 August 2005.  Demographics  The Austrian census of 2020 recorded that the village had a population of 106.Statistik Austria: Bev√∂lkerung am 1.1.2020 nach Ortschaften (Gebietsstand 1.1.2020) Retrieved 13 September 2020 The Age reported in 2005 that it had 104 people and 32 houses.  Name  Fucking is most famous for its four traffic signs with its name on them, beside which tourists stop to have their photograph taken, owing to the profane English word with the same spelling. British and American soldiers based in nearby Salzburg noticed the name after World War II, and began to travel to the village to have their photos taken beside the signs while striking various poses. The local residents, the Fuckingers, were considerably bemused, as they had not previously been aware of the meaning of their village's name when read as English. Since then, the number of visitors to Fucking has increased, with the occasional visit by a tour bus. = Popularity and notoriety = Street map of Fucking The village is especially popular with British tourists; as a local tour guide explained: \\"The Germans all want to see Mozart's house in Salzburg; the Americans want to see where The Sound of Music was filmed; the Japanese want Hitler's birthplace in Braunau; but for the British, it's all about Fucking.\\" Augustina Lindlbauer, the manager of an area guesthouse, noted that the area had lakes, forests, and vistas worth visiting, but there was an \\"obsession with Fucking\\". Lindlbauer recalled how she had to explain to a British female tourist \\"that there were no Fucking postcards.\\" The road signs were commonly stolen as souvenirs‚Äîthe only crime which has been reported in the village. It cost some 300 euros to replace each stolen sign, and the costs were reflected in the taxes that local residents pay. In 2004, owing mainly to the stolen signs, a vote was held on changing the village's name, but the residents voted against doing so. Tarsdorf municipality's mayor Siegfried H√∂ppl stated that it was decided to keep the name as it had existed for 800 years, and further stated that \\"[e]veryone here knows what it means in English, but for us Fucking is Fucking‚Äîand it's going to stay Fucking.\\" After a spate of thefts, which included the theft of all four signs in one night, and a total of fifteen over a period of several years, in August 2005 the road signs were replaced with theft-resistant ones, welded to steel and secured in concrete to prevent theft. Mayor H√∂ppl said that officials were fed up with English-speaking tourists stealing the signs, and noted that with the newly installed signs it would take all night to steal one. H√∂ppl said that tourists, and the money they bring to the area, were welcome, but locals were sick of replacing the road signs. Commander Schmitzberger, the local police chief, also hinted at other avenues to stop what he calls \\"foreign criminals\\" from disturbing order in the village. Regarding these \\"other avenues\\", Schmitzberger stated, \\"[w]hat they are, I am not at liberty to disclose, but we will not stand for the Fucking signs being removed. It may be very amusing for you British, but Fucking is simply Fucking to us. What is this big Fucking joke? It is puerile.\\" A resident of the village, Josef Winkler, attempted to cash in on the village's fame by setting up a website on which he sold T-shirts featuring the village road signs, with the slogan \\"I like Fucking in Austria\\" printed on them. According to Winkler, they were selling well, and he was in negotiations with Maxim regarding possible promotions, but was forced to stop his venture after being shouted at and threatened in the street. Winkler said, \\"It was a bit of fun that didn't hurt anyone, but I found out that in this region you just can't do something like that. The whole thing became a real trial for me and I had to stop. People are very traditional here.\\" In July 2009, it was announced that the village would install CCTV cameras in an attempt to deter summertime tourists from filming themselves having sexual intercourse in front of the Fucking signs. A resident of the village said that installing cameras around the village may make tourists think twice and instead choose only to have a photograph taken in front of the sign. Mayor Franz Meindl states: \\"We don't find it funny. We just want to be left alone. We don't harm anyone and just want to live in peace.\\" and added that he would prefer not to see the village featured in the press any more. In 2009, the European Union's OHIM trademarks agency forbade a German brewery to market a beer called \\"Fucking Hell\\". It appealed, and was granted permission in January 2010 to market the beer. It claims the beer is named after the Austrian village Fucking and the German term for pale lager, Hell. The similarity between Fucking and \\"fucking\\" has also resulted in the village being the butt of jokes in popular media. The Grand Tour featured the town in the 2017 episode \\"[censored] to [censored]\\", as part of a road trip throughout a number of towns in Europe whose names are similar to English-language vocabulary for sexual and romantic activity. In 2019, Norwegian broadcasting company NRK Sport produced a comedic tourism video on Fucking. Released on YouTube, the video consists of reporter and former Melodi Grand Prix Junior presenter Nicolay Ramm both advertising the village's attractions and listing off a large number of double entendres based around its name. = False rumours of name change = Rumours spread through international news media in April 2012 that villagers had been thinking about changing the name of the village or had actually voted to change it. The satirical website The Spoof! published a story on 18 April 2012 saying that the villagers were fed up and wanted to change the name. This minor satire was expanded upon and appeared on the same day in the Daily Mirror newspaper and elsewhere during the following week as a genuine news item, and was repeated by The Guardian and The Huffington Post, who reported that a vote had taken place to change the name to Fugging, but it was discovered that a village with that name already existed in the municipality of Obritzberg-Rust just west of Herzogenburg. The mayor of Fucking denied these rumours when contacted.

Formed in Atlanta, Georgia in 1991, the group enjoyed success during the 1990s. After the addition of Rozonda \\"Chilli\\" Thomas, they scored nine top-ten hits on the Billboard Hot 100, including four number-one singles \\"Creep\\", \\"Waterfalls\\", \\"No Scrubs\\", and \\"Unpretty\\". The group also recorded four multi-platinum albums, including CrazySexyCool (1994), which received a diamond certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). TLC also became the first R&B; group in history to receive the Million certification from the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for FanMail (1999). Having sold over 85 million records worldwide, TLC is the best-selling American girl group. VH1 ranked TLC as the greatest female group, placing them at number 12 on the list of 100 Greatest Women in Music. Billboard magazine ranked TLC as one of the greatest musical trios, as well as the seventh most successful act of the 1990s. The group's accolades include four career Grammy Awards, five MTV Video Music Awards, and five Soul Train Music Awards. Twenty years after their debut, TLC was honored with Outstanding Contribution to Music at the 17th MOBO Awards and Legend Award at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards Japan. Following Lopes's death in 2002, instead of replacing her, the remaining members chose to continue as a duo. On June 30, 2017, they released their eponymous fifth album TLC. History=1990‚Äì1991: Formation and early years= In 1990, Atlanta, Georgia‚Äìbased record producer Ian Burke and one of his clients, a teenager named Crystal Jones, came up with a concept for a girl group with a tomboyish, hip-hop image, similar to the blend of contemporary R&B; and hip hop music of new jack swing act Bell Biv DeVoe. Jones put out a call for two more girls to join her in this trio. Her request was eventually answered by Tionne Watkins, a native of Des Moines, Iowa, who had moved to Atlanta with her family at a young age, and Lisa Lopes, a rapper who had just moved to the city from her native Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with a small keyboard and $750 ($ today). Calling the group 2nd Nature, Jones, Watkins, and Lopes began working with producers Jermaine Dupri and Rico Wade on demo tape material. Through a connection at the hair salon where Watkins worked, the group eventually managed to arrange an audition with singer Perri \\"Pebbles\\" Reid, who had started her own management and production company, Pebbitone. Impressed by the girls, Reid renamed the group TLC, with \\"TLC\\" being an acronym for the names Tionne, Lisa, and Crystal. Reid arranged an audition for them with local record label LaFace Records, run by Kenneth \\"Babyface\\" Edmonds and Reid's then-husband, Antonio \\"L.A.\\" Reid. Antonio Reid saw potential in Watkins and Lopes as performers but felt that Jones should be replaced. According to Jones, things began to unravel for her after Pebbles denied the group the opportunity to take home the contracts that Pebbitone had drafted. Jones did not want to sign before having the contract reviewed by others and perhaps a lawyer. In contrast, Watkins's recollection of Jones's departure is that both she and Lopes asked Jones to leave the group before their initial contracts were negotiated. On February 28, 1991, Watkins and Lopes signed production, management, and publishing deals with Pebbitone,Tionne WATKINS (T'Boz), Lisa Lopes (Left Eye), Rozonda Thomas (Chilli), Debtors. v.

As they looked for a replacement for Jones, the two-member TLC made its first recorded appearance on a track for LaFace act Damian Dame's self- titled 1991 LP.Cass, Giles, Heyliger (June 7, 2013). 'Face Time: Damian Dame, \\"Right Down to It\\". Popdose. Retrieved February 11, 2014. Pebbles found the third member in Rozonda Thomas, one of Damian Dame's part-time backup dancers. Thomas was signed to the act in April 1991, and to maintain TLC's name as an acronym for the girls' names, Watkins became \\"T-Boz\\", Lopes became \\"Left-Eye\\", and Thomas became \\"Chilli\\". The girls were then signed to LaFace in May through the production deal with Pebbitone; their records would be distributed by Arista Records/BMG. TLC was immediately set up to go into the studio with Reid and Edmonds, Dallas Austin, Jermaine Dupri, and Marley Marl producing their first album. The new trio debuted as backing vocalists on \\"Rebel (With a Cause)\\", a track on Jermaine Jackson's sole album for LaFace, You Said (1991). =1992‚Äì1993: Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip and early success= Their debut album, Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip, was released on February 25, 1992, by LaFace/Arista Records. The songs on the album are a blend of funk (Watkins), hip-hop (Lopes), and R&B; (Thomas), similar to the new jack swing sound popularized by producer Teddy Riley in the late 1980s. The album was a critical and commercial success, being certified quadruple-platinum for shipments of four million copies in the United States. It scored three top-ten singles on the Billboard Hot 100 with \\"Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg\\", \\"Baby-Baby-Baby\\" (peaked at number two), and \\"What About Your Friends\\", as well as the top 30 single \\"Hat 2 Da Back\\". TLC's debut album, chiefly written by Dallas Austin and Lisa Lopes, consisted of playful lyrics, with some female-empowering songs. It was characterized by Watkins's tenor vocals, Thomas's alto vocals, and Lopes's soprano raps. The musical formula was augmented by the girls' brightly colored videos and curious costuming: each girl wore wrapped condoms on their clothing (Lopes also wore one over her left eye in a pair of glasses). During TLC's first national tour, as MC Hammer's opening act, Lopes and Thomas discovered that Watkins had sickle-cell anemia, an ailment which she kept a closely guarded secret until she became very ill while TLC was touring the Southwest US. Watkins continued to battle her condition and eventually became a spokesperson for the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America in the late 1990s. She was hospitalized, Lopes and Thomas stayed with her, and some concerts were canceled. At the conclusion of the tour, TLC‚Äîwho had received a tiny amount of money up to this point‚Äîdecided to take more control of their careers and thus informed Pebbles that they no longer wished her to be their manager. Reid released the group from its management deal, but they remained signed to Pebbitone, and Reid continued to receive a share of their earnings. Also, in 1994, TLC played the musical group \\"Sex as a Weapon\\" in the New Line Cinema feature film House Party 3, starring Kid 'n Play. Lopes began dating Atlanta Falcons American football player Andre Rison shortly after the release of Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip, and by 1994 the two were living together in Rison's upscale double-story home. Their relationship was allegedly filled with violent moments, and Lopes filed an assault charge against Rison on September 2, 1993. Rison denied battering her. Lopes was also battling alcoholism at the time. She had been a heavy drinker since the age of fifteen. After another fight between the couple in the early morning hours of June 9, 1994, Lopes tossed numerous pairs of Rison's newly purchased shoes into a bathtub, doused them with lighter fluid, and lit them on fire. The fiberglass bathtub quickly melted and set the structural frame of the house on fire. Lopes was arrested and indicted on charges of first-degree arson; she was sentenced to five years of probation and a $10,000 fine. Rison eventually reconciled with Lopes, and they continued dating on and off for seven years. =1993‚Äì1997: CrazySexyCool, career height and bankruptcy= TLC's second studio album, CrazySexyCool saw the group reunited with producers Dallas Austin, Babyface, and Jermaine Dupri, as well as new collaborators; Organized Noize, Chucky Thompson, and Sean \\"Puffy\\" Combs. Lopes was released from rehab to attend the recording sessions, but the finished album featured significantly less of her raps and vocals. An R&B; and hip hop soul album, CrazySexyCool featured hip-hop beats, funk, deep grooves, propulsive rhythms, and smooth production Released on November 15, 1994, CrazySexyCool was critically acclaimed, with Rolling Stone ranking it among the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. CrazySexyCool debuted at number 15. Eventually, it peaked at number three on the Billboard 200 and spent over two years on the chart. The album sold over 11 million copies in the United States alone and received a diamond certification from the RIAA. With worldwide sales exceeding 23 million copies, CrazySexyCool became one of the best-selling albums by a girl group and was later outsold by the Spice Girls' Spice (1996). All four singles from CrazySexyCool reached the top five on the Billboard Hot 100‚Äî\\"Creep\\" and \\"Waterfalls\\" reached number one, \\"Red Light Special\\" peaked number two, and \\"Diggin' on You\\" reached number five. \\"Waterfalls\\", an Organized Noize- produced song that features an old-school soul-based musical arrangement, socially conscious lyrics criticizing drug dealing and unsafe sex, and an introspective rap from Lopes, became the biggest hit of TLC's career. Its million-dollar music video was an MTV staple for many months and made TLC the first black act to win MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year. At the 38th Annual Grammy Awards, TLC took home Best R&B; Album and Best R&B; Performance by a Duo or Group for \\"Creep\\". Billboard also crowned TLC as the Artist of the Year at the 1996 Billboard Music Awards. Amidst their apparent success, the members of TLC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on July 3, 1995. TLC declared debts totaling $3.5 million, some of it due to Lopes's insurance payments arising from the arson incident and Watkins's medical bills, but the primary reason being that the group received what they called a less than favorable deal from Pebbitone. After Arista Records, LaFace, and Pebbitone recouped their investment for recording costs and manufacturing and distribution (common recoupable charges in most record contracts), both Pebbitone and LaFace Records went on to charge for expenses such as airline travel, hotels, promotion, music videos, food, clothing, and other expenses. According to the members of TLC, ironically, the more successful the album became, the more they were in debt. In addition to this, managers, lawyers, producers, and taxes had to be paid, leaving each member of the group with less than $50,000 a year after having sold millions upon millions of albums. TLC sought to renegotiate their 1991 contract with LaFace, under which they received only 56 cents (split three ways) per album sold‚Äîconsiderably less than most major label recording contracts. They received less for each single sold. TLC also wanted to dissolve their association with Pebbitone. LaFace Records refused to renegotiate their deal midway through the contract, thus prompting TLC to file a bankruptcy petition. Both Pebbitone and LaFace countered that TLC \\"simply\\" wanted more money and were in no real financial danger, resulting in two years of legal debates before the cases were finally settled in late 1996. TLC's contract was renegotiated with LaFace, and Pebbitone agreed to let them out of their production/management deal in exchange for Pebbitone receiving a percentage of royalties on some future releases. By this time, Pebbles had separated from her husband. TLC also bought the rights to the name TLC, which was previously owned by Pebbles. TLC recorded the theme song to Nickelodeon's popular sketch comedy All That, which was produced and co-written by Arnold Hennings. The show ran for ten seasons from 1994 to 2005, and was later revived in 2019. The group appeared on the soundtrack album of the Forest Whitaker's 1995 film Waiting to Exhale with \\"This Is How It Works\\" (a song written by Babyface and Lopes) and was set to re-enter the recording studio the following year after signing a new contract with LaFace and with distribution handled by Arista. Watkins began to release her solo effort with \\"Touch Myself\\", a single from the soundtrack album of 1996 film Fled; It reached the top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100. Lopes also collaborated with fellow female rappers Missy \\"Misdemeanor\\" Elliott, Da Brat, and Angie Martinez on Lil' Kim's single \\"Not Tonight\\". It peaked at number six on the Hot 100 and was nominated for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group at the 40th Grammy Awards. =1998‚Äì2001: FanMail and members feud= Preliminary work on TLC's third studio album was delayed when friction arose between the group and their main producer Dallas Austin, who was by this time dating Thomas and helping to raise their son Tron. Austin wanted $4.2 million and creative control to work on the project, resulting in a stand-off between the producer and the artists. During this period, Thomas appeared in the independent film HavPlenty, while Watkins co-starred with rappers Nas and DMX in Hype Williams's 1998 film Belly. Lopes started her own production company, Left-Eye Productions, and signed Blaque, a female R&B; trio. Under her guidance, Blaque released their 1999 self-titled debut album, which was certified platinum and contained two top-ten singles on the Billboard Hot 100. Lopes also hosted the short-lived MTV talent series The Cut (1998), which featured then-unknown recording artists Ne-Yo and Anastacia. TLC eventually began working with other producers for their third album, until finally negotiating with Austin, who produced the bulk of the album. Lopes always had an idea of a futuristic-feel for the project, which Austin incorporated into the album. Titled FanMail, the album was released in February 1999, another critical and commercial success. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart and was certified six-time platinum by the RIAA for six million copies shipped in the United States; worldwide sales exceed 14 million copies. \\"No Scrubs\\" was released as the lead single and became a worldwide hit, topping the singles charts in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United States. The album's second single, \\"Unpretty\\", became TLC's fourth number-one hit on the Billboard Hot 100. The other three singles also received decent radio play: \\"Silly Ho\\", \\"I'm Good at Being Bad\\", and Edmonds-written ballad, \\"Dear Lie\\". At the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards, FanMail received eight nominations, and won three awards: Best R&B; Album, Best R&B; Song and Best R&B; Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals, the last two for \\"No Scrubs\\". At the Lady of Soul Awards, the group was honored with the Aretha Franklin Entertainer of the Year Award. The group went on a worldwide tour, entitled the FanMail Tour. The group had a PayPerView special of their tour, which at the time became PayPerView's highest grossing televised special. During and after the release of FanMail, Lopes made it known to the press on multiple occasions that she felt that she was unable to express herself in TLC fully. Her contributions to songs had been reduced to periodic eight-bar raps, and there were several songs in which she had no vocals. Studio session singers such as Debra Killings often sang background vocals for the group's songs, something Lopes also wanted to do on songs in which she did not rap. In late 1999, Entertainment Weekly published a letter written by Lopes that challenged her groupmates Watkins and Thomas to all record solo albums and see which album performed the best: The ladies eventually settled the feud, and The Challenge was never taken up. After the conclusion of the successful FanMail tour, the ladies took some time off and pursued personal interests. Lopes was the first to begin recording her solo album, Supernova. The album was released in Europe, and the first ‚Äî and only ‚Äî single \\"The Block Party\\" reached the Top 20 on the UK Singles Chart. The song was released in the United States a few weeks before the scheduled album release. However, when the song did not perform well, the album's release was canceled for North America, and no further singles were promoted. In 2000, Spice Girls member Melanie C collaborated with Lopes on the single \\"Never Be the Same Again\\"; it became an international hit reaching number one in many countries. =2002‚Äì2006: Line-up changes, 3D and R U the Girl= Following her unsuccessful debut solo album, Supernova, Lopes started working on her second solo album. On April 25, 2002, before the album was completed, Lopes died in a car crash while filming a documentary in Honduras, which would later be released as The Last Days of Left Eye in 2007 on VH1. After taking a hiatus following Lopes's death, Watkins, Thomas, and Austin decided that they would complete the remainder of their fourth album, to be called 3D, which also featured production from Rodney Jerkins, The Neptunes, Raphael Saadiq, Missy Elliott, and Timbaland. They also decided that TLC would retire after the release and promotion of 3D, rather than replace Lopes and continue as a group. However, ultimately, they chose to carry on as a duo. Lopes appears vocally on 3D as she had already completed her vocals for two songs for the new album. Also, two other songs featured vocals of hers taken from previously unreleased songs. Several of the songs eulogized Lopes. 3D was released on November 12, 2002. Upon its release, 3D debuted at number six on the Billboard 200 and was certified two times platinum by the RIAA for two million shipped in the United States. It failed to generate success overseas, except for Japan, where it reached number two and achieved platinum from the RIAJ for 200,000 copies sold. The album's lead single, \\"Girl Talk\\", peaked at number 28 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it their lowest-charting lead single ever. Its music video featured Watkins and Thomas alone in live-action segments and Lopes in animated segments. It was followed by \\"Hands Up\\", which became their first single not to enter the Hot 100 chart (peaking at number seven on the Bubbling Under R&B;/Hip-Hop Singles), and \\"Damaged\\", which reached number 53 on the Hot 100. In June 2003, a year after the death of Lopes, at Zootopia, an annual concert hosted by New York radio station Z100 held at Giants Stadium, TLC appeared in what was announced to be their last performance. The group, introduced by Carson Daly, showed a video montage dedicated to Lopes and went on to perform songs against video footage of Lopes performing the same songs, and wearing the same outfits, that were appearing onstage. Nevertheless, TLC made a comeback in February 2004 as a featured artist on a Japanese charity single entitled VOICE OF LOVE POSSE with other Japanese artists. In 2003, LaFace released the first TLC's greatest hits album entitled Now & Forever: The Hits with a new song, \\"Come Get Some\\", featuring Lil Jon and Sean P of the YoungBloodZ. However, the compilation was not released in the United States until June 2005. The album debuted at number 53, with 20,000 copies sold. On June 25, 2004, Watkins and Thomas announced that they were pitching a reality television show that was eventually picked up for development by UPN. Titled R U the Girl, the show debuted on July 27, 2005. Despite media speculation that the winner of the series was to become a new, permanent member of TLC, Watkins and Thomas have vowed never to replace Lopes with a new member. The winner of the show, 20-year-old Tiffany \\"O'so Krispie\\" Baker, recorded with Watkins and Thomas on a new song, \\"I Bet\\", and perform it together in a live concert finale in Atlanta. Roughly 4.1 million viewers tuned in for the season finale of R U The Girl on September 20, 2005. \\"I Bet\\" was released to radio and iTunes on October 4, 2005, but failed to make onto the charts. The song later became a bonus track on Now & Forever: The Hits. =2007‚Äì2014: Hiatus and biographical television film= Watkins and Thomas performing at Justin Timberlake's 2009 benefit concert On August 20, 2007, a new greatest hits album was released in the UK called Crazy Sexy Hits: The Very Best of TLC. The album fared better than previous compilation Now & Forever: The Hits, peaking at number 57 on the UK Albums Chart. On June 24, 2008, Watkins and Thomas made a special appearance on the BET Awards. They, along with the original members of En Vogue and SWV, performed in Alicia Keys's tribute to girl groups. On April 4, 2009, the group performed a 13-song set in Japan during the 2009 Springroove music festival. On October 17, 2009, TLC performed their set to the 10,000 audience at the Justin Timberlake and Friends benefit concert, held at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in the Las Vegas Valley, U.S. On May 25, 2011, TLC also performed for the season finale of American Idol. In 2012, Watkins and Thomas appeared in British pop group Stooshe's music video for their cover version of \\"Waterfalls\\". It was later be included in Totally T-Boz, a docu- series chronicling Watkins's move to California, health issues, and solo endeavors. Stooshe later performed \\"Waterfalls\\" at the 17th annual MOBO Awards on November 3, 2012, where TLC was honored with Outstanding Contribution to Music. On June 23, 2013, TLC received the Legend Award at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards Japan, at which they also performed a medley of their hit singles. On June 19, 2013, to celebrate their 20th anniversary in the music industry, the group released a Japan-exclusive compilation album entitled TLC 20: 20th Anniversary Hits, which includes remastered versions of their old songs; as a gift for their Japanese fans, they also recorded a new version of \\"Waterfalls\\", enlisting Japanese singer Namie Amuro to sing Lopes's part. The decision to record with Amuro was raised as an issue by Lopes's family, who felt \\"betrayed\\", as they were not informed about the vocal replacement. Watkins and Thomas subsequently stated that they had been unable to gain clearance to use Lopes's vocals for the new version of the song, but that Lopes would have approved of having Amuro on the track. TLC was featured on \\"Crooked Smile\\", the second single from American rapper J. Cole's 2013 album Born Sinner. It peaked at number 27 on the Billboard Hot 100, giving TLC their first top-40 hit in over a decade. The collaboration won the \\"Impact Track\\" award at the 2013 BET Hip Hop Awards and was nominated for MTV Video Music Award for Best Video with a Social Message at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards. They also made an appearance at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, introducing Drake's performance. TLC signed a new recording contract with Epic Records and released an American version of the compilation album 20 on October 15, 2013. The album included one new recording, \\"Meant to Be\\", written and produced by Ne-Yo.Caulfield, Keith (10-26-2013). \\"Sales of TLC's '20' Surge 200 Percent After VH1 Biopic Premiere\\". The Hollywood Reporter. Retrieved February 11, 2013. The song served as the soundtrack for CrazySexyCool: The TLC Story, a TLC biographical telefilm, which premiered on VH1 on October 21, 2013. Directed by Charles Stone III, the film starred Keke Palmer as Thomas, Lil Mama as Lopes and Drew Sidora as Watkins. The film uses the newly rearranged songs from TLC 20: 20th Anniversary Hits. The premiere broadcast garnered 4.5 million viewers, a five-year ratings high for VH1.Andreeva, Nellie (10-22-2013). \\"VH1's TLC Biopic Draws 4.5 Million Viewers\\". Deadline Hollywood. Retrieved February 11, 2013. In November 2013, TLC had three albums charting on the Billboard 200, including 20 at number 12, CrazySexyCool at number 108 and Now and Forever: The Hits at number 169. On November 24, 2013, TLC performed a highly anticipated rendition of \\"Waterfalls\\" at the 2013 American Music Awards, with Lil Mama delivering Lopes's part, including the rap segment. Subsequently, TLC performed \\"No Scrubs\\" with Lil Mama on the Dancing With The Stars television show. In January 2014, TLC appeared at VH1's \\"Super Bowl Concert Series\\" performing at the Beacon Theater in New York City. TLC announced the first Australian tour of their career in April 2014 that will consist of shows in Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, and Perth. The group will be performing a set of their hits & will include visual and vocal representation of Lopes for the performance. On December 12, 2014, TLC released a new Christmas song entitled \\"Gift Wrapped Kiss\\". =2015‚Äìpresent: Comeback tours and self-titled studio album= TLC performing live in 2016 On January 19, 2015, TLC announced their plan to release their fifth and final album with the launch of a Kickstarter campaign. They asked fans to help finance the project by donating a pledge of at least $5 to reach their goal of $150,000. In less than 48 hours, they surpassed their goal and become the \\"fastest most funded pop project in Kickstarter history\\". Among other artists who donated were New Kids on the Block (donating $10,000), Katy Perry (donating $5,000), Soulja Boy, Bette Midler, and Justin Timberlake. The Kickstarter campaign raised a total of $400,000. In an interview published following the end of the campaign, Watkins and Thomas clarified that they would never split up following the release and promotion of the album and that they would continue to perform together as TLC. In May 2015, TLC embarked on a North American tour with New Kids on the Block and Nelly titled The Main Event Tour. It was their first tour in 15 years since the completion of the Fanmail Tour in 2000. Subsequently, TLC embarked on TLC 2016‚Äì17 Tour and I Love the 90s: The Party Continues Tour. During the development of their album, they petitioned Lisa Lopes's brother Ron Lopes for assistance with making Left Eye's presence on the album a possibility since she had an abundance of unreleased material. However, while being interviewed by Toronto music station 93-5 The Move on September 21, Thomas stated, \\"Actually on the last album after she passed away we went through a lot of her raps and used those then. I don't think so because we've already done that.\\" On October 28, 2016, TLC released two new songs off of the new album called \\"Joyride\\" and \\"Haters\\" in Japan. The former hit number one on the iTunes R&B; chart in Japan. For the first time ever, on December 8, 2016, TLC performed \\"Sleigh Ride\\" with surprise guest Missy Elliott along with their latest song \\"Sunny\\" on Taraji's White Hot Holidays, a holiday special on Fox hosted by actress Taraji P. Henson. Their fifth and most recent studio album, TLC, was released on June 30, 2017. It was reported to have collaborations from Dallas Austin and Kandi Burruss. The album's first single \\"Way Back\\" featuring Snoop Dogg was released April 14 to all major digital music outlets and streaming services, but not to radio. The single was produced by D'Mile and released via TLC's newly formed independent label 852 Musiq, which is distributed through RED Distribution in the US. On May 9, 2017, TLC made its UK Debut at London's KOKO. Ultimately, TLC sold 12,000 copies domestically in the first week. In July 2019, TLC embarked on the \\"Whole Lotta Hits Tour\\" co-headlining with Nelly and supported by Flo Rida. Legacy Vibe believed that there would be no \\"all-black female R&B; group having a chemistry, cultural and commercial impact as remotely comparable as TLC\\" and dubbed CrazySexyCool as \\"the blueprint for female ensembles to follow\\". The Philippine Daily Inquirer called TLC \\"the most influential female group the world has ever seen\\". Singer Beyonc√©, the former lead singer of Destiny's Child, stated that \\"TLC has influenced just about every female group that's out there now, and they definitely influenced Destiny's Child.\\" Craig JC from Clutch wrote that TLC was \\"big and influential\\" during the 1990s and that their contemporaries such as SWV, Total, Blaque, 3LW, Brownstone, 702, Jade, Xscape and En Vogue did not have TLC's crossover appeal. David A. Keeps from Rolling Stone explained the impact of TLC: > TLC's career has been filled with both hits and headlines. The group was one > of the few R&B; acts to build a strong identity out of its initial success, > and they exerted more control over each successive record. Their music ‚Äì > particularly the 11-million-selling CrazySexyCool and the 6-million-selling > FanMail, both of which won two Grammys each ‚Äì set the standard for > contemporary R&B.; TLC helped to pioneer a deft blend of acoustic and > computer sounds that paved the way for groups like Destiny's Child, as did > their image as independent women. Whether addressing AIDS in \\"Waterfalls\\" or > the struggle for female self-esteem in \\"Unpretty\\", they showed themselves > able to take serious issues to the top of the pop charts. TLC is the best-selling American girl group of all time, with 85 million records sold worldwide, along with being the second best selling girl group worldwide, after the Spice Girls.

The band gained mainstream recognition in the mid-to-late 1990s, during the third wave of ska with the release of the gold certified album Turn the Radio Off. Soon after, the band lost mainstream recognition but gained an underground cult following. As of 2006, the band was no longer signed to a major record label and has since been independent. After many line-up changes throughout the years, front man Aaron Barrett is the only remaining founding member in the band. History=1991‚Äì2001: Early success= The band formed in 1991 while the members were in high school. The group started as a cover band until they released a demo in 1992, titled In The Good Old Days. With the departure of Ben Guzman soon after, then backup vocalist Aaron Barrett took his place as lead singer. The band then changed its genre to ska. Reel Big Fish's self- released debut album, Everything Sucks, was successful and became an underground hit spread by word-of-mouth, which led to the band signing a deal with Mojo Records. In August 1996, the band released the album Turn the Radio Off on the new label, which appealed to fans of ska punk style, and the band began touring throughout the United States. After the single \\"Sell Out\\" became well known in mainstream venues, including MTV, the album peaked at number 57 on the Billboard charts, staying on the charts for 32 weeks. However, the ska revival was short-lived, and the group's 1998 album Why Do They Rock So Hard? failed to match the sales of the band's previous record. In 1998, the band appeared in the movie BASEketball, performing in the stands to rouse the crowd. The band also appeared on the film's soundtrack with a cover of a-ha's \\"Take On Me\\". Why Do They Rock So Hard? was the last album for two members of the band. Trombonist Grant Barry was fired for his conduct, culminating with him committing battery on a security guard at Mississippi Nights during a concert in St. Louis and drummer Andrew Gonzales left the band to spend more time with his family. =2001‚Äì2006: Major label years= Trumpet player Tavis Werts left the band in 2001. The band fared much better on the rock charts in 2002 with the album, Cheer Up!, particularly because of the single \\"Where Have You Been?\\" which did not include the horn section. Former Suburban Rhythm drummer Carlos de la Garza and former Spring Heeled Jack trumpeter Tyler Jones, who tracked for two songs on Cheer Up! (because Werts had already recorded the majority of his trumpet parts before his departure), were brought in. De la Garza's last concert with Reel Big Fish was on June 20, 2003 at the House of Blues in Anaheim, California. That concert was later released as a DVD in The Show Must Go Off! series. Jones appeared in the music videos for \\"Where Have You Been?\\" and \\"Monkey Man\\" (although neither featured any trumpet-playing), and continued to play live with the band until early 2005. Jones was replaced by trumpeter John Christianson (nicknamed Johnny Christmas), who had previously played with Barrett in the band, The Forces of Evil. On April 5, 2005, the band released its fourth album on Mojo, We're Not Happy 'Til You're Not Happy. Justin Ferreira (who replaced De La Garza) was on drums for the recording, but left before the album's release to join the Orange County band Takota and subsequently is listed as an additional musician on the CD. He was replaced by Ryland Stee. Compared to the previous album (Cheer Up!), which was more lighthearted and cheerful, Allmusic describes the songs in We're Not Happy 'Til You're Not Happy as \\"angry\\" and \\"embittered\\", but also deemed the album as \\"super catchy\\". Common themes expressed throughout the songs include jealousy, regret, short-lasting fame, and disappointment toward mainstream record companies. Aaron Barrett has stated that We're Not Happy 'Til You're Not Happy was \\"the third record in a trilogy\\" that began with Turn the Radio Off. \\"The first one was about being in a band and trying to make it. Then Why Do They Rock So Hard? was like, 'we've made it, we're rock stars'. Cheer Up we made because we had to make it. But We're Not Happy 'Til You're Not Happy is about us being old and jaded now.\\" =2006‚Äìpresent: Independent work= While on tour in early 2006, Reel Big Fish were dropped from the Jive Records label. The band formed its own label and released a 3-disc live performance CD/DVD set, Our Live Album Is Better Than Your Live Album. This package became available on July 18, 2006 on the Internet and in retail stores on August 22. Jive later released a Reel Big Fish greatest hits album, Greatest Hit...And More. On February 20, 2007, the band released Duet All Night Long, which is a split EP with Zolof the Rock & Roll Destroyer. It features six cover songs (three from each band), with the vocalist of each band performing in the other band's songs (except in the case of Scott Klopfenstein singing in the song, \\"Say Say Say\\".) The band released its first studio album since leaving Jive Records; Monkeys for Nothin' and the Chimps For Free worldwide on July 10, 2007, on the Rock Ridge Music record label. On June 26, 2007, shortly before its release, the band announced in a Myspace blog that Matt Wong was leaving the band to spend more time with his wife and newborn child. He was replaced by Derek Gibbs who played bass in Jeffries Fan Club and Aaron Barrett's now defunct side project, The Forces Of Evil. Since Matt Wong was very popular with fans, some were skeptical of the new bassist's ability, but the band has stated that Derek is \\"Matt Wong Approved\\" and fans have nothing to worry about. Gibbs had been filling in for Wong on various tours since early 2002. On December 19, 2007, the band announced that it would play the entire Warped Tour 2008. Reel Big Fish released a new studio album on January 20, 2009.\\"Reel Big Release Date.\\" Absolutepunk.net. October 16, 2008. The name of the album is Fame, Fortune and Fornication, and it consists of 10 cover songs. Another album, A Best of Us for the Rest of Us, featuring a 22-track disc of re-recorded songs and a 14-track disc of \\"Skacoustic\\" versions produced by lead singer Aaron Barrett, was released on July 20, 2010. An extended version of the album, A Best of Us for the Rest of Us (Bigger Better Bonus Deluxe Version), was released on June 21, 2011. The group also intended to work on a new album, recording new songs in the fall of 2010. The band has also recorded a live DVD at The Grove in Anaheim, California, on January 4, 2009; which was released on July 21, 2009 with the title Reel Big Fish Live! In Concert! In an interview with 'The Examiner', Aaron Barrett stated that he planned on releasing a new album, with all new material, in late 2011. On January 11, 2011, the band announced that longtime member Scott Klopfenstein would be leaving the band to focus on raising a family.\\"Scott Klopfenstein leaves Reel Big Fish\\". Punknews.org. January 11, 2011. Matt Appleton of Goldfinger began filling in for Scott on the band's 20th Anniversary Tour, and he has since been announced as a permanent replacement. This marks the first time since 1995 that the band has had a saxophone player. In March 2012, Reel Big Fish announced via Facebook that the group had begun recording a new album of new, original songs. The album is titled Candy Coated Fury, though the band also considered Honk If You're Horny as a title. The album was released on July 31, 2012. On October 21, 2013 the band announced via its website that long-time trombonist Dan Regan, who has played with Reel Big Fish since 1994, will depart from the band to spend more time with his family and follow his dream of starting a brewery. Reel Big Fish announced a co-headline UK and Ireland tour with Less than Jake with support from Zebrahead in early 2014. In November 2014, Reel Big Fish announced on Facebook that the group would release an EP titled Happy Skalidays scheduling release in December 15, 2014. In February 2015, the band announced through its website that drummer Ryland Steen had gone on hiatus from the band in order to play drums in America. Since the summer of 2014, Edward Larsen of Suburban Legends has been filling in. On October 9, 2018, through their Instagram page, the band announced a new single called \\"You Can't Have All of Me\\", released on October 12. They also confirmed the title for the new album to be Life Sucks...Let's Dance! and a December release. On April 11, 2019, Billy Kottage announced that he had quit the band via his Instagram page. Kottage has since toured as a featured musician with The Interrupters. Brian Robertson of Suburban Legends has been playing with the band as of June 2019.

It was designed by Courtney F. Allen and published by Avalon Hill in 1983. Hasbro now owns the franchise, and at one time licensed it to Multi-Man Publishing, a license that has since expired without republication of the game. There was an attempt to reprint Up Front through Kickstarter in 2013. The project raised over $300,000, but no updates to status has been posted since March 21, 2014. In 2016 Hasbro licensed Wargame Vault to sell Up Front as a print on demand product; and the game is now available through on-line ordering. The official rules are currently available to order either as a printed book or as a portable document format electronic file. The components (cards) are produced on high quality card-stock with all known official errata incorporated in the reprints. Description Subtitled The Squad Leader Card Game, Up Front was intended as a card version of their successful Squad Leader series of games, but it represented a radical change in approach. Traditional wargames are based on maps representing terrain and game pieces representing units, which attack on their players' turns. Up Front has terrain, attack opportunities, and other factors determined by cards dealt to the players. Fans of the game claim this type of play gives the player a more realistic feel for man-to-man combat where most terrain will be unfamiliar. With traditional map-based wargames, players have an overhead view of the entire battlefield. In Up Front, locations are revealed as the game is played, emulating how real soldiers might encounter and explore terrain. The game contains two different kinds of cards, Personality and Action. A Personality card depicts a single soldier and several statistics about him including his name, rank, and the weapon he is carrying. These are assigned by the scenario selected (scenarios lettered A-L were included in the base game) and arranged in groups by the players. The Action Deck contains different types of cards including terrain, movement, heroes, and many other game factors. These are shuffled and dealt to the players. The original game included German, U.S., and Russian units along with their equipment. Expansions added to the nationalities available for play. Each nationality was given different capabilities including variations in hand size and discard ability which imposes different tactics for the players by limiting the options available to them.  Expansions  Two official expansions were released for Up Front: * Banzai (1984), which included Japanese, British, and USMC forces along with rules for Jungle Terrain, Random Reinforcements, and Scenarios M-X. * Desert War (1985), which included French, and Italian forces as well as rules for Desert Terrain. Both expansions are now available as print to order products from Wargame Vault. Reception Sandy Petersen comments: \\"If you can find a copy of Up Front, and you like tactical combat at all, check it out. Or even if you just like card games. In either case, you won't be disappointed. This is a game that surpasses its flaws, and turns some of them into strengths.\\"  Legacy  Like many Avalon Hill games, Up Front continues to be popular among loyal fans. There are active groups dedicated to the game on the Internet. There is also a VASSAL Engine module for this game. Wargame Vault now sells licensed copies of the original game and both expansions as print to order products.

Built in 1464,... gates of the city of L√ºbeck. Built in 1464, the gate now serves as a ... touropia.com the Brick Gothic construction is one of the relics of L√ºbeck's medieval city fortifications and one of two remaining city gates, the other being the Citadel Gate (\\"Burgtor\\"). Known for its two-round towers and arched entrance, it is regarded today as a symbol of the city. Together with the old city centre (Altstadt) of L√ºbeck it has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1987.  Appearance  The \\"city side\\" of the Holsten Gate in 2015 The Holsten Gate is composed of a south tower, a north tower and a central building. It has four floors, except for the ground floor of the central block, where the gate's passageway is located. The side facing west (away from the city) is called the \\"field side\\", the side facing the city the \\"city side\\". The two towers and the central block appear as one construction when viewed from the city side. On the field side, the three units can be clearly differentiated. Here the two towers form semicircles which at their widest point extend 3.5 metres beyond the central block. The towers have conical roofs; the central block has a pediment. = Passageway and inscriptions = Inscription on the field side of the Holsten Gate: CONCORDIA DOMI FORIS PAX The passageway once had two gates on the field side, which have not survived. A portcullis installed in 1934 does not correspond to the original security installations. Instead, there was once a so-called \\"pipe organ\\" at this location, with individual bars which could be lowered separately rather than together as a set. Thus it was possible to first lower all but one or two rods, leaving a small gap for their own men to slip through later. There is an inscription over the passageway on both the city side and the field side. On the city side it reads, \\"SPQL\\" and is framed by the years 1477 and 1871, the former being the supposed date of construction (the correct date is, however, now known to be 1478), the latter being the date of the gate's restoration and the founding of the German Reich. This inscription was modeled on the Roman \\"SPQR\\" (Latin Senatus populusque Romanus - the Senate and People of Rome) and stands for Senatus populusque Lubecensis. It was, however, affixed only in 1871. There was previously no inscription at this location. It would also have been pointless, since the view of the lower parts of the Holsten Gate from the city side was obscured by high walls. There is another inscription on the field side. The text is \\"concordia domi foris pax\\" (\\"harmony within, peace without\\"). This inscription is also from 1871 and is a shortened form of the text which had previously been on the (not preserved) foregate: \\"Concordia domi et pax foris sane res est omnium pulcherrima\\" (\\"Harmony within and peace without are indeed the greatest good of all\\"; see \\"Outer Holsten Gate\\" below). = Fortifications on the field side = Functionally, the field and the city side have very different designs. While the city side is richly decorated with windows, this would be inappropriate on the field side considering the possibility of combat situations. On the field side there are accordingly only a few small windows. In addition, the walls are interspersed with embrasures. Also, the wall thickness on the field side is greater than on the city side: 3.5 metres compared to less than 1 metre. The reasoning during construction may have been to be able to quickly destroy the gate from the city side in an emergency, so that it would not fall into enemy hands as a bulwark. The loopholes and the openings of the gun chambers are directed toward the field side. In each tower there were three gun chambers, one each on the ground, first and second floors. Those on the ground floor have not been preserved. Since the building has subsided over the centuries, they are now 50 centimetres below ground level, and even below the new flooring. On the first upper storey there are, in addition to the aforementioned chambers, two slits for small guns which were above and between the three chambers. There are also small openings on the third upper storey with forward- and downward-directed slits for firing small arms. The central block has no loopholes. The windows above the passage were also designed for dousing invaders with pitch or boiling water. = Ornamentation = The most striking nonfunctional embellishments are two so-called terracotta stripes which encircle the building. These consist of individual tiles, most of which are square with sides of 55 centimetres. Each tile bears one of three different ornaments: either an arrangement of four heraldic lilies, a symmetrical lattice, or a representation of four thistle leaves. There is no apparent order to these recurring symbols, but each group of eight tiles is always followed by a tile with a different design. It has the form of a heraldic shield and bears either the L√ºbeck heraldic eagle or a stylized tree. These shields are flanked by two male figures who function as bearers of a coat of arms. The terracotta stripes were repaired during restoration work between 1865 and 1870. Only three of the original tiles are preserved as museum specimens. The new tiles approximate the former design, although liberties were taken during the restoration. For example, the design of the heraldic eagle motif is by no means a reflection of the original. The pediment was also not faithfully restored, but this is not the fault of the restorers, since in the 19th century it had long been gone and its original appearance was unknown. An old view on an altarpiece in the L√ºbeck fortress monastery shows a Holsten Gate with five pediment towers. But since this picture shows the Holstentor Gate in the middle of a fantasy landscape of mountains and forests the credibility of the representation is disputed. Today, three towers crown the pediment, but they are visible only from the city side. It was constructed with red bricks. = Interior = Modern reproduction of a cannon in the Holsten Gate Both tower interiors have the same design. The ground floor and first upper story have the highest ceilings, while the floors above are much lower. Two narrow spiral staircases wind their way upwards, in each case between the central building and the adjacent tower. On each floor corridors connect the rooms of the central block with tower rooms at the same level. The ceiling of the north tower's second floor has been removed, so that today the second and third upper storeys there share a common space. This change dates from 1934 and does not reflect the original situation. The gun chambers are in front of the loopholes. Today there are guns in the chambers of the second floor, but they are not originals and were placed there at a late date. Above the gun chambers are hooks from which chains were suspended and attached to the cannon to cushion the recoil after firing. The higher gun chambers of the first upper storey could only be accessed with ladders.  History  The rich and wealthy Hanseatic city of L√ºbeck felt the need in the course of the centuries to protect itself from outside threats with ever stronger walls and fortifications. Three gates gave access to the city: the Citadel Gate in the north, Mill Gate in the south, and the Holsten Gate in the west. To the east, the city was protected by the dammed Wakenitz River. Here, the less martial H√ºxter Gate led out of the city. These city gates were initially simple gates which were repeatedly strengthened over time so that they eventually all had an outer, middle and inner gate. Today, only fragments remain of these ancient city gates. The gate now known as the Citadel Gate is the former Interior Citadel Gate; the Middle and Outer Citadel Gates no longer exist. All three Mill Gates have completely disappeared. The gate now known as the Holsten Gate is the former Middle Holsten Gate; there was also an (older) Inner Holsten Gate, an Outer Holsten Gate, and even a fourth gate, known as the Second Outer Holsten Gate. So the history of the Holsten Gate is actually the history of four consecutive gates, although only one of them is left. The names of the individual gates changed as a matter of course as their components emerged and disappeared. The Middle Holsten Gate was once the Outer Holsten Gate before the gates on either side were constructed. Still today there is a great deal of confusion about the names as one studies the historical record. The four gates and their history are described below. = Inner Holsten Gate = The Holsten Gate in 1700 - The drawing shows the various gates as they appeared around 1700. In the front the Second Outer Holsten Gate is visible, followed by the Outer and Middle Holsten Gates Behind the Holsten Bridge is the Inner Holsten Gate‚Äîin this picture the half-timbered construction which replaced the original gate in the 17th century. The oldest Holsten Gate guarded the nearby banks of the Trave River. One had to leave the city through this gate in order to get to the Holsten Bridge, which crossed the river. It is not known when a gate was erected here for the first time. The Holsten Bridge was first mentioned in a 1216 deed signed by the king of Denmark. It is likely that already at that time there was a gate and a city wall along the Trave River. The designations \\"Holsten Bridge\\" (and \\"Holsten Gate\\") are simply a consequence of the fact that the city's western exit was in the direction of Holstein. Historical records indicate that the Holsten Bridge and Holsten Gate were renewed in 1376. There is good evidence for the appearance of the gate erected at that time in a woodcut of a view of the city of L√ºbeck produced by Elias Diebel. Although this is a city view from the eastern, Wakenitz side of the old inner city hill, the artist has folded out essential parts of the gate's west side, so that they too become visible. It was a rectangular tower with a wooden gallery on the upper part. At an unknown date in the 17th century, the Inner Holsten Gate was replaced by a smaller, simple half-timbered gate‚Äîpossibly because no point was seen in having a strong inner gate in light of the strong outer fortifications which had been erected in the meantime. The Inner Holsten Tor was connected to the dwelling of the tollkeeper, who guarded the access to the city at this location. The half-timbered gate was replaced by a simple iron gate in 1794, which in turn was demolished in 1828, together with the tollkeeper's house and the city wall along the Trave River. It is likely that there was a gate also on the opposite bank of the Trave at an early date. But nothing is known of its appearance. If it existed, it was torn down before or after the construction of the Middle Holsten Gate. = Middle Holsten Gate = In the 15th century the entire gate construction was considered to be inadequate. The proliferation of firearms and canon made stronger fortifications necessary. It was decided to build another gate‚Äîthe Outer Holsten Gate, later known as the Middle Holsten Gate and today only as the Holsten Gate. Funding was secured by a legacy of the councilman John Broling amounting to 4,000 L√ºbeck marks.Emil Ferdinand Fehling: L√ºbeckische Ratslinie. Nr. 525 In 1464 the city's architect, Hinrich Helmstede, began construction, which was completed in 1478. It was erected on a seven-metre high hill raised for the purpose. Already during the construction period this foundation proved to be unstable. The south tower sagged because of the marshy ground and already during constructions attempts were made to compensate for its inclination. For more history of the Middle Holsten Gate see the section on demolition and restoration below. = Outer Holsten Gate = The exterior Holsten Gate was also known as the Renaissance Gate, the Foregate or the Crooked Gate. It was constructed in the 16th century when a wall was built west of the Middle Holsten Gate into which a gate was inserted. The outer Holsten Gate was completed in 1585. The new gate obstructed the view of the Middle Holsten Gate since its eastern exit was located only 20 metres from that construction. A walled area known as the zwinger was created between the two gates. Its foregate was small compared with the approximately one hundred years older Middle Holsten Gate, but much more richly decorated on the field side. The city side was by contrast left plain. The Outer Holsten Gate was the first gate to bear an inscription. It read, \\"Pulchra res est pax foris et concordia domi ‚Äì MDLXXXV\\" (\\"It is wonderful to have peace without and harmony within - 1585\\") and was placed on the city side. It was later moved to the field side and slightly modified (\\"Concordia domi et foris pax sane res est omnium pulcherrima\\", \\"harmony within and peace without are the greatest good of all\\"). Connected to the gate was the home of the Wall Master, who was responsible for the maintenance of the fortifications. The builder of the Renaissance gate was probably the city architect Hermann von Rode, who designed the front following Dutch prototypes. For example, the Nieuwe Oosterpoort in Hoorn is directly comparable. This gate existed for about 250 years and was in the end sacrificed to the railway; it was demolished in 1853 to make room for the first L√ºbeck train station and tracks. Today, this station no longer exists either; the present station is located about 500 metres to the west. = Second Outer Holsten Gate = At the beginning of the 17th century new city walls were built in front of the city moat, under the supervision of military engineer Johhann von Br√ºssel. As part of this construction a fourth Holsten Gate was built in 1621. It was completely integranted into the high walls and topped by an octagonal tower. The archways bore the inscriptions \\"Si Deus pro nobis, quis contra nos\\" ( \\"If God be for us, who can be against us?\\" on the city side and \\"sub alis altissimi ( \\"Under the protection of the Most High\\" on the field side. This gate was the last of the four Holsten Gates to be constructed and the first to disappear, namely in 1808. = Demolition and restoration in the 19th century = In the course of industrialization, the fortifications were considered to be only annoying obstacles. In 1808 the second outer Holsten Gate was demolished, in 1828 the inner Holsten Gate, and in 1853 the outer Holsten Gate. It was then considered to be only as a matter of time before the Middle Holsten Gate, the only remaining of the four gates, would be torn down. Indeed, in 1855, L√ºbeck citizens petitioned the Senate to finally demolish the remaining gate, since it hindered the extension of the railway facilities. This petition had 683 signatures. The Holsten Gate around 1900. Looking west at the gate's eastern side, which faces L√ºbeck's old city centre (\\"city side\\") However, there was at that time also growing resistance to the destruction of old buildings. Thus August Reichensperger wrote in 1852, \\"Even L√ºbeck, once the proud head of the Hanseatic League, does not seem able to endure the reflection of its former glory. It maims, crops and covers up so assiduously that \\"modern Enlightenment\\" will soon have nothing to be ashamed of any more\\". When King Frederick William IV of Prussia heard of this, he sent Prussia's then-curator of historic monuments, Ferdinand von Quast, to salvage whatever could be saved.Otto Dziobek: Geschichte des Infanterie-Regiments L√ºbeck (3. hanseatisches) Nr. 162; erste Auflage 1922, im Zusammenhang mit dem General v. Quast und der Bedeutung der v. Quasts f√ºr L√ºbeck Controversy over the demolition went on for a long time. A decision was made only in 1863 when the L√ºbeck citizens decided by a majority of just one vote not to demolish the building but to instead extensively restore it. Meanwhile, the gate was in very bad condition, since every year it had sunk a few centimetres further into the ground. The lowest loopholes were already 50 centimetres below ground, and the inclination of the entire gate was beginning to be dangerous. This drastically altered the statics of the building, so that its collapse was feared. The Holsten Gate was thoroughly restored, with work continuing into 1871. Afterwards there was a change in the relationship of the L√ºbeck population to the Holsten Gate. It was no longer perceived as a troublesome ruin, but as a symbol of a proud past. In 1925, the German Association of Cities made the Holstentor its symbol. As early as 1901, the marzipan manufacturer Niederegger used the Holsten gate in its company trademark. Other L√ºbeck companies did the same. = Restoration 1933/34 = Since the towers continued to slant and their collapse could still not be ruled out, a second restoration became necessary. This occurred in the years 1933-34, during which the Holsten Gate was stabilized so that it finally stood firm. In this final restoration, reinforced concrete anchors were used to secure the towers, which were girded by iron rings. Changes were, however, also made which did not correspond with the original character of the gate, including the above- mentioned merging of north tower floors. The Nazis turned the Holsten Gate into a museum. It was called the Hall of Honor and Glory, and was supposed to represent L√ºbeck and German history from the perspective of Nazi ideology. In the second half of the 20th century minor repairs were made to the Holsten Gate which are no longer in line with current standards for architectural conservation. = Restoration 2005/06 = From March 2005 to December 2006, the Holsten Gate was again restored. The restoration was estimated to cost around one million euros, with 498,000 euros (the originally planned cost) being provided by the German Foundation for Monument Protection and the Possehl Foundation. The remaining costs were primarily covered through donations from individuals, companies and academic institutions. A swastika dating from 1934 was cut out and taken away by unknown parties a few days after the scaffolding was installed for the repairs. It was considered to be the last swastika still remaining on a public building in Germany and was supposed to be concealed with metal sheeting as part of the restoration work. A plate with the date 2006 was put up where the stolen swastika had been to commemorate the completion of restoration work. On 2 December 2006, the Holstentor reopened to the public as part of a light show created by the artist Michael Batz. For safety reasons the gate had been obscured during restoration by a high resolution depiction of the gate before work had begun, printed on scaffolding tarpaulins.  The Holsten Gate today  Ship models in the Holsten Gate In 1950 the Holsten Gate was again a museum, this time for municipal history. Relics from historic L√ºbeck were presented, the development of medieval L√ºbeck was shown by using models and pictures, and models of the ships of the Hanseatic League and the flagship \\"Eagle of L√ºbeck\\" were exhibited. The features of this museum were also not historically accurate. For example, the museum also included a torture chamber with a dungeon, a rack and other torture devices. But the Holsten Gate had never contained anything like that. The two monumental iron statues of reclining lions placed in an area in front of the Holsten Gate designed by Harry Maasz date from 1823 and are unsigned. They are attributed to Christian Daniel Rauch and may possibly have been made with the collaboration of a member of Rauch's workshop, Th. Kalide (1801-1863). One lion is asleep, the other is awake and attentively regards the other. They were originally placed in front of the house built in 1840 by the L√ºbeck merchant and art collector John Daniel Jacobj (1798-1847) at Gro√üe Petersgrube 18. In 1873 they were placed in front of the Hotel Stadt Hamburg am Klingenberg until its destruction in 1942 during World War II, and only later in front of the Holsten Gate. They are complemented by a bronze statue on the other side of the street, the Striding Antilope, by the sculptor Fritz Behn. Image:Luebeck HT lion right.jpg Lion on guard Image:Luebeck HT lion left.jpg Sleeping lion Image:BehnAntilope.jpg Striding antelope The Holsten Gate Museum was modernized in 2002. Not only was the torture chamber removed; all rooms were redesigned according to a new concept that involved the integration of image and sound documentation. As of 2006, the museum has been managed by the Cultural Foundation of the Hanseatic City of L√ºbeck.  Surroundings  The Holsten Gate is located in the L√ºbeck city wall complex on the main access road connecting the main railway station with the suburb of St. Lorenz and crossing the Puppen Bridge. The Holsten Gate Square (\\"Holstentorplatz\\") is enclosed on one side by a branch of the Deutsche Bundesbank; with new construction extending the original Reichsbank building to the rear. On the other side there is the brick expressionist Holsten Gate Hall (\\"Holstentorhalle\\") between the historic salt warehouses and the DGB's House of Trade Unions (\\"Gewerkschaftshaus\\"). This building was altered with funds from the Possehl Foundation to create a rehearsal and teaching facility for L√ºbeck's University of Music (\\"Musikhochschule L√ºbeck\\") was rebuilt. Another pedestrian bridge over the Upper Trave River was completed in spring 2007 to provide a connection the university's main building complex in the old city centre. Miscellaneous= On currency and postage stamps = Until 1995, when the German Federal Republic's third series of bank notes was removed from circulation, an engraving of the Holsten Gate (western / field side) adorned the back of the 50 DM note The Holsten Gate appears on the 50 DM bank notes produced from 1960 to 1991 and on the German two-euro coin issued in 2006. In 1948 it appeared on the four highest denominations (DM 1, DM 2, DM 3 and DM 5) of the first long-term series of postage stamps in German mark currency, which featured buildings. In 2000 it appeared on the 5 DM and 10 DM postage stamp of another series, \\"Places of Interest\\". = In video games = The gate appeared in the trading simulation The Patrician The gate also appeared as a landmark in the Maxis PC game Simcity 3000. = Other uses = Since 1926 there has been a stylization of the Holsten Gate in the emblem of the German Association of Cities (Deutscher St√§dtetag DST). A simplified and scaled-down replica of the Holsten Gate was completed in 2008 for the Hansa Park in Sierksdorf. The current Guinness World Record for the fastest marathon dressed as a landmark building was achieved by a Richard Mietz wearing a Holstentor costume at the 2018 Berlin Marathon The Amphicar (a mass-produced amphibious automobile) built in L√ºbeck in the 1960s, sports a golden image of the Holstentor on the horn button in the center of the steering wheel. Many people who see the Amphicar think the emblem is a castle.

Pioneer methods utilized the fact that membrane-spanning regions contain more hydrophobic residues than other parts of the protein, however applying different hydrophobic scales altered the prediction results. Later, several statistical methods were developed to improve the topography prediction and a special alignment method was introduced.DAS According to the positive-inside rule, cytosolic loops near the lipid bilayer contain more positively-charged amino acids. Applying this rule resulted in the first topology prediction methods. There is also a negative-outside rule in transmembrane alpha-helices from single-pass proteins, although negatively charged residues are rarer than positively charged residues in transmembrane segments of proteins. As more structures were determined, machine learning algorithms appeared. Supervised learning methods are trained on a set of experimentally determined structures, however, these methods highly depend on the training set.TMHMM serverPhobius serverOCTOPUS server Unsupervised learning methods are based on the principle that topology depends on the maximum divergence of the amino acid distributions in different structural parts.HMMTOP server It was also shown that locking a segment location based on prior knowledge about the structure improves the prediction accuracy. This feature has been added to some of the existing prediction methods.HMMTOP serverPhobius server The most recent methods use consensus prediction (i.e. they use several algorithm to determine the final topology) TOPCONS server and automatically incorporate previously determined experimental informations.CCTOP server HTP databaseThe human transmembrane proteome database provides a collection of topologies that are computationally predicted for human transmembrane proteins. Discrimination of signal peptides and transmembrane segments is an additional problem in topology prediction treated with a limited success by different methods. Both signal peptides and transmembrane segments contain hydrophobic regions which form Œ±-helices. This causes the cross-prediction between them, which is a weakness of many transmembrane topology predictors. By predicting signal peptides and transmembrane helices simultaneously (Phobiushttp://phobius.sbc.su.se/), the errors caused by cross-prediction are reduced and the performance is substantially increased. Another feature used to increase the accuracy of the prediction is the homology (PolyPhobius).‚Äù It is also possible to predict beta-barrel membrane proteins' topology.

Game of buzkashi in Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan Playing Kokpar by Franz Roubaud History Buzkashi began among the nomadic Turkic peoples who came from farther north and east spreading westward from China and Mongolia between the 10th and 15th centuries in a centuries-long series of migrations that ended only in the 1930s. From Scythian times until recent decades, buzkashi has remained a legacy of that bygone era.G. Whitney Azoy, Buzkashi: Game and Power in Afghanistan, Third Edition. Waveland Press 2011. pp.3-4.G. Whitney Azoy, Buzkashi: Game and Power in Afghanistan, 2nd ed. (2002), In: Academic Dictionaries and Encyclopedias \\"buzkashi\\" During the rule of the Taliban regime, buzkashi was banned in Afghanistan, as the Taliban considered the game immoral. After the Taliban regime was ousted, the game resumed being played. Distribution Today games similar to buzkashi are played by several Central Asian ethnic groups such as the Kyrgyz, Turkmens, Kazakhs, Uzbeks, Uyghurs, Hazaras, Tajiks, Pashtuns, and Baloch people. In the West, the game is also played by Afghan Turks (ethnic Kyrgyz) who migrated to Ulupamir village in the Van district of Turkey from the Pamir region. In western China, there is not only horse-back buzkashi, but also yak buzkashi among Tajiks of Xinjiang. =Afghanistan= Buzkashi is the national sport and a \\"passion\\" in Afghanistan where it is often played on Fridays and matches draw thousands of fans. Whitney Azoy notes in his book Buzkashi: Game and Power in Afghanistan that \\"leaders are men who can seize control by means foul and fair and then fight off their rivals. The Buzkashi rider does the same\\".Tony Perry Afghans love to get their goat in rough national sport January 3, 2009 page A20 LA Times Traditionally, games could last for several days, but in its more regulated tournament version, it has a limited match time. =Kazakhstan= A game of kokpar, Kazakhstan Buzkashi or Ulak tartysh players in Tajikistan, photo by Janyl Jusupjan Kazakhstan's first National Kokpar Association was registered in 2000. The association has been holding annual kokpar championships among adults since 2001 and youth kokpar championships since 2005. All 14 regions of Kazakhstan have professional kokpar teams. The regions with the biggest number of professional kokpar teams are Southern Kazakhstan with 32 professional teams, Jambyl region with 27 teams and Akmola region with 18 teams. Kazakhstan's national kokpar team currently holds a title of Eurasian kokpar champions. =Kyrgyzstan= A photograph documents kokboru players in Kyrgyzstan around 1870; however, Kyrgyzstan's kokboru rules were first officially defined and regulated in 1949. Starting from 1958 kokboru began being held in hippodromes. The size of a kokboru field depends on the number of participants.The nomad game =Tajikistan= The buzkashi season in Tajikistan generally runs from November through April. High temperatures often prevent matches from taking place outside of this period, though isolated games might be found in some cooler mountain areas. In Tajikistan and among the Tajik people of Tashkorgan in China's Xinjiang region, buzkashi games are particularly popular in relation to weddings as the games are sponsored by the father of the bride as part of the festivities. = United States = Buzkashi was brought to the U.S. by a descendant from the Afghan Royal Family, the family of King Amanullah and King Zahir Shah. A mounted version of the game has also been played in the United States in the 1940s. Young men in Cleveland, Ohio played a game they called Kav Kaz. The men ‚Äì five to a team ‚Äì played on horseback with a sheepskin-covered ball. The Greater Cleveland area had six or seven teams. The game was divided into three \\"chukkers\\", somewhat like polo. The field was about the size of a football field and had goals at each end: large wooden frameworks standing on tripods, with holes about two feet square. The players carried the ball in their hands, holding it by the long-fleeced sheepskin. A team had to pass the ball three times before throwing it into the goal. If the ball fell to the ground, the player had to reach down from his horse to pick it up. One player recalls, \\"Others would try to unseat the rider as he leaned over. They would grab you by the shoulder to shove you off. There weren't many rules.\\"Dean, Ruth and Melissa Thomson, Making the Good Earth Better: The Heritage of Kurtz Bros., Inc. pp. 17‚Äì18 Mounted team-based potato races, a popular pastime in early 20th-century America, bore some resemblance to buzkashi, although on a much smaller and tamer scale. Rules and variations Competition is typically fierce. Prior to the establishment of official rules by the Afghan Olympic Federation, the sport was mainly conducted based upon rules such as not whipping a fellow rider intentionally or deliberately knocking him off his horse. Riders usually wear heavy clothing and head protection to protect themselves against other players' whips and boots. For example, riders in the former Soviet Union often wear salvaged Soviet tank helmets for protection. The boots usually have high heels that lock into the saddle of the horse to help the rider lean on the side of the horse while trying to pick up the goat. Games can last for several days, and the winning team receives a prize, not necessarily money, as a reward for their win. Top players, such as Aziz Ahmad, are often sponsored by wealthy Afghans. A buzkashi player is called a Chapandaz; it is mainly believed in Afghanistan that a skillful Chapandaz is usually in his forties. This is based on the fact that the nature of the game requires its player to undergo severe physical practice and observation. Similarly horses used in buzkashi also undergo severe training and due attention. A player does not necessarily own the horse. Horses are usually owned by landlords and highly rich people wealthy enough to look after and provide for training facilities for such horses. However a master Chapandaz can choose to select any horse and the owner of the horse usually wants his horse to be ridden by a master Chapandaz as a winning horse also brings pride to the owner. The game consists of two main forms: Tudabarai and Qarajai. Tudabarai is considered to be the simpler form of the game. In this version, the goal is simply to grab the goat and move in any direction until clear of the other players. In Qarajai, players must carry the carcass around a flag or marker at one end of the field, then throw it into a scoring circle (the \\"Circle of Justice\\") at the other end. The riders will carry a whip to fend off opposing horses and riders. When not in use - e.g. because the rider needs both hands to steer the horse and secure the carcass - the whip is typically carried in the teeth. The calf in a buzkashi game is normally beheaded and disemboweled and has 2 limbs cut off. It is then soaked in cold water for 24 hours before play to toughen it. Occasionally sand is packed into the carcass to give it extra weight. Though a goat is used when no calf is available, a calf is less likely to disintegrate during the game. While players may not strap the calf to their bodies or saddles, it is acceptable - and common practice - to wedge the calf under one leg in order to free up the hands. The headless carcass of a goat used in buzkashi = Afghanistan = These rules are strictly observed only for contests in Kabul. # The ground has a square layout with each side long. # Each team consists of 10 riders. # Only five riders from each team can play in a half. # The total duration of each half is 45 minutes. # There is only one 15 minute break between the two halves. # The game is supervised by a referee. =Kyrgyzstan= Kokboru field and two football fields Kazan Rules of kokboru have undergone several changes throughout history. Modernized rules of kokboru are: # There are two teams with 12 participants each. # Only 4 players a team are allowed to play on the field at any given time. # Teams are allowed to substitute players or their horses. # The game is played on a field 200 meters long and 70 meters wide. # Two kazans ‚Äì big goals with a 4.4 meters in diameter and 1.2 meters high are placed on opposite sides of a field. # The total duration of three periods is 60 minutes. # There is a 10 minute break between each period. # A goal is scored each time a ulak (goat carcass) is placed in an opponent's kazan. # A kokboru is brought to centre of the field after scoring a goal. It is also prohibited to ride towards the spectators and/or receive spectators' assistance or to start a kokboru game without giving an oath to play justly. =Tajikistan= In Tajikistan, buzkashi is played in a variety of ways. The most common iteration is a free-form game, often played in a mountain valley or other natural arena, in which each player competes individually to seize the buz and carry it to a goal. Forming unofficial teams or alliances does occur, but is discouraged in favor of individual play. Often, dozens of riders will compete against one another simultaneously, making the scrum to retrieve a fallen buz a chaotic affair. Tajik buzkashi games typically consist of many short matches, with a prize being awarded to each player who successfully scores a point. In popular culture=In books and film adaptations= Buzkashi is portrayed in several books, both fiction and non-fiction. It is shown in Steve Berry's book The Venetian Betrayal, and it is briefly mentioned in the Khaled Hosseini book The Kite Runner. Buzkashi was the subject of a book called Horsemen of Afghanistan by French photojournalists Roland and Sabrina Michaud. Gino Strada wrote a book named after the sport (with the spelling Buskash√¨) in which he tells about his life as surgeon in Kabul in the days after the 9-11 strikes. P.J. O'Rourke also mentions the game in discussions about Afghanistan and Pakistan in the Foreign Policy section of Parliament of Whores, and Rory Stewart devotes a few sentences to it in \\"The Places in Between\\". Two books have been written about buzkashi which were later turned into films. The game is the subject of a novel by French novelist Joseph Kessel titled Les Cavaliers (aka Horsemen), which then became the basis of the film The Horsemen (1971). The film was directed by John Frankenheimer with Omar Sharif in the lead role, and U.S. actor and accomplished horseman Jack Palance as his father, a legendary retired chapandaz. This film shows Afghanistan and its people the way they were before the wars that wracked the country, particularly their love for the sport of buzkashi. The game is also a key element in the book Caravans by James Michener and the film of the same name (1978) starring Anthony Quinn. A scene from the film featuring the king of Afghanistan watching a game included the real-life king at the time, Mohammed Zahir Shah. The whole sequence of the game being witnessed by the king was filmed on the Kabul Golf Course, where the national championships were played at the time the film was made. In Ken Follett's book, Lie Down with Lions (1986), the game is mentioned being played, but instead of a goat, they used a live Russian soldier. =In film= A number of films also reference the game. :fr: La Passe du Diable (1956), by Jacques Dupont and Pierre Schoendoerfer. The Horsemen (1971) starring Jack Palance and Omar Sharif as father and son is centered on the game. Both La Passe du Diable and The Horseman are based on a novel by Joseph Kessel. In Rambo III (1988), directed by Peter MacDonald, John Rambo (played by Sylvester Stallone) was shown in a sequence playing and scoring in a buzkashi with his mujahideen friends when suddenly they were attacked by the Soviets. The Tom Selleck film High Road to China (1983) features a spirited game of buzkashi. Buzkashi is described at length in Episode 2, \\"The Harvest of the Seasons\\", of the documentary The Ascent of Man by Jacob Bronowski. It is put in the context of the development, by the Mongols, of warfare using the horse and its effect on agricultural settlements. The film includes several scenes from a game in Afghanistan. The opening scenes of the Bollywood film Khuda Gawah (1992), which was filmed in Afghanistan and India, show actors Amitabh Bachchan and Sridevi engaged in the game. The game is mentioned briefly in John Huston's film The Man Who Would Be King (1975) based on a story by Rudyard Kipling, the movie Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (2004) during advertisements for the fictional ESPN 8 (El Ocho) television channel and episode 15 of season 5 of NCIS: Los Angeles (2015). The 2012 joint international-Afghan short film Buzkashi Boys depicts a fictional story centered on the game, and has won awards at several international film festivals. On January 10, 2013, The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nominated Buzkashi Boys for an Oscar in the category of Short Film (Live Action) for the 85th Academy Awards. Venerated Buzkashi (ulak tartysh in Kyrgyz) player, 82 year old veteran school teacher Khamid Boronov stars in 2016 feature documentary film Letters from the Pamirs by Janyl Jusupjan. Famed Buzkashi players of Jaylgan village Shamsidin and Kazyke appear in a sequence to show the elements of Buzkashi to kids from a town. A spirited Buzkashi match is one of the last episodes of the film made in Jerge-Tal Kyrgyz region in Tajikistan's north. Buzkashi is mentioned in The Secret Life of Walter Mitty where it is translated as 'Goat Hockey' and is a clue to the location of 'Sean O'Connell'.

He was a successful general under Domitian, commanding forces in Roman Britain, and on the Rhine and Danube frontiers. A novus homo, he was consul three times. Frontinus ably discharged several important administrative duties for Nerva and Trajan. However, he is best known to the post-Classical world as an author of technical treatises, especially De aquaeductu, dealing with the aqueducts of Rome.  Career  In AD 70, Frontinus participated in the suppression of the Rhineland revolt, and later recorded that he received the surrender of 70,000 Lingones.Strategemata 4.3.14. A.R. Birley, The Fasti of Roman Britain (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1981), p. 70 Between that date and being appointed governor of Britain to succeed Quintus Petillius Cerialis a few years later, Frontinus was appointed suffect consul. While governor of Britain, he subjugated the Silures of South Wales and is thought to have likewise campaigned against the Brigantes.Birley, Fasti, p. 71 He was succeeded by Gnaeus Julius Agricola, the father-in-law of the famous historian Tacitus, in 77. Birley believes it \\"is fair to speculate\\" that Frontinus was with Domitian during the German campaign of 83. An inscription at Hieropolis in Phrygia, as well as a number of coins of Smyrna, attests that he was proconsul of Asia in AD 86. In 97, he was appointed curator aquarum (supervisor of the aqueducts) by the emperor Nerva, an office only conferred upon persons of very high standing. In this capacity, he followed another distinguished Roman statesman, Agrippa, the friend, ally and son-in-law of Augustus, who organised in 34 BC a campaign of public repairs and improvements, including renovation of the aqueduct Aqua Marcia and an extension of its pipes to cover more of the city. The following year Frontinus held a second consulship as suffect in February, with Trajan as his colleague, and two years later he was made consul ordinarius with Trajan. Birley notes, \\"This exceptional honour underlines the high regard in which he [Frontinus] was held, and suggests, further, that Trajan had a debt to repay.\\" He was also a member of the College of Augurs.Birley, Fasti, p. 72 He died in 103 or 104, a date based on Pliny the Younger writing to his friends that he was elected to the college of augurs to fill the vacancy Frontinus' death had created.  Family  Due to a lack of either a titulus honorarius or sepulcralis, there is no outline of Frontinus' life, the names of his parents, or of his wife. Some details can be inferred from chance mentions: He is thought to be of Narbonese origins, and originally of the equestrian class.William McDermott, \\"Stemmata quid faciunt? The descendants of Frontinus\\", Ancient Society, 7 (1976), p. 255 From the nomenclature of the name of Publius Calvisius Ruso Julius Frontinus (consul c. 84), it is likely Frontinus had a sister, who was the other's mother.Ronald Syme, \\"P. Calvisius Ruso. One Person or Two?\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 56 (1984), pp. 190f Frontinus had at least one daughter, the wife of Quintus Sosius Senecio (cos. 99, II 107) and mother of Sosia Polla.McDermott, \\"Stemmata quid faciunt?\\", p. 254  Writings =Aqueducts of Rome= Remains of aqueducts Aqua Claudia and Aqua Anio Novus, integrated into the Aurelian Wall as a gate in 271 AD. Frontinus's chief work is De aquaeductu, in two books, an official report to the emperor on the state of the aqueducts of Rome. It presents a history and description of the water-supply of Rome, including the laws relating to its use and maintenance. He provides the history, sizes and discharge rates of all of the nine aqueducts of Rome at the time at which he was writing at the turn of the 1st century AD: the Aqua Marcia, Aqua Appia, Aqua Alsietina, Aqua Tepula, Anio Vetus, Anio Novus, Aqua Virgo, Aqua Claudia and Aqua Augusta. Frontinus describes the quality of water delivered by each, mainly depending on their source, be it river, lake, or spring. Fraud and theft One of the first jobs he undertook when he was appointed water commissioner was to prepare maps of the system so that he could assess their condition before undertaking their maintenance. He says that many had been neglected and were not working at their full capacity. He was especially concerned by diversion of the supply by unscrupulous farmers and tradesmen, among many others. They would insert pipes into the channel of the aqueducts to tap the supply. He, therefore, made a meticulous survey of the intake and the supply of each line, and then investigated the discrepancies. Lead pipe stamps bearing the name of the owner were also used to prevent such water theft. He was well aware of the seminal work De Architectura by Vitruvius, which mentions aqueduct construction and maintenance published in the previous century; Frontinus refers to the possible influence of Vitruvius on the plumbers.[25:1] Remains of Aqua Claudia Distribution system Distribution of the water depended in a complex way on its height entering the city, the quality of the water, and its rate of discharge. Thus, poor-quality water would be sent for irrigation, gardens, or flushing, while only the best would be reserved for drinking water. Intermediate-quality water would be used for the many baths and fountains. However, Frontinus criticized the practice of mixing supplies from different sources, and one of his first decisions was to separate the waters from each system. Maintenance He was very concerned by leaks in the system, especially those in the underground conduits, which were difficult to locate and mend, a problem still faced by water engineers today. The aqueducts above ground needed care to ensure that the masonry was kept in good condition, especially those running on arched superstructures. It was, he said, essential to keep trees at a distance so that their roots would not damage the structures. He reviewed the existing law governing the state aqueducts, as well as the need for enforcement of those statutes. =Military tactics= Frontinus also wrote a theoretical treatise on military science, which is lost. His extant work on military matters, the Stratagems (Latin: Strategemata), is a collection of examples of military stratagems from Greek and Roman history, for the use of generals. He draws on his own experience as a general in Germania under Domitian, but similarities between the anecdotes he records and versions of other Roman authors like Valerius Maximus and Livy suggest that he drew mainly on literary sources. The authenticity of the fourth book has been challenged.Paper by Rogier van der Wal (Amsterdam) to the 2010 Classical Association Conference, Cardiff One example he gives of control of river water during a siege reads: Selected editions and translations=De aquaeductu= * The standard edition of the Latin text of Frontinus' major work, with extensive commentary in English, is now R.H.

They were bordered to the north by the Ordovices; to the east by the Dobunni; and to the west by the Demetae.  Origins  According to Tacitus's biography of Agricola, the Silures usually had a dark complexion and curly hair. Due to their appearance, Tacitus believed they had crossed over from Spain at an earlier date. > \\"... the swarthy faces of the Silures, the curly quality, in general, of > their hair, and the position of Spain opposite their shores, attest to the > passage of Iberians in old days and the occupation by them of these > districts; ...\\" (Tacitus Annales Xi.ii, translated by M. Hutton) Jordanes, in his Origins and Deeds of the Goths, describes the Silures. > \\"The Silures have swarthy features and are usually born with curly black > hair, but the inhabitants of Caledonia have reddish hair and large loose- > jointed bodies. They are like the Gauls or the Spaniards.\\" The Iron Age hillfort at Llanmelin near Caerwent has sometimes been suggested as a pre-Roman tribal centre.BBC on Llanmelin But most archaeologists believe thhat the people who became known as the Silures were a loose network of groups with some shared cultural values, rather than a centralised society. Although the most obvious physical remains of the Silures are hillforts such as those at Llanmelin and Sudbrook, there is also archaeological evidence of roundhouses at Gwehelog, Thornwell (Chepstow) and elsewhere, and evidence of lowland occupation notably at Goldcliff.Miranda Aldhouse-Green and Ray Howell (eds.), Gwent In Prehistory and Early History: The Gwent County History Vol.1, 2004,  Etymology  The Latin word Silures is of Celtic origin, perhaps derived from the Common Celtic root *sƒ´lo-, 'seed'. Words derived from this root in Celtic languages (e.g. Old Irish s√≠l, Welsh hil) are used to mean 'blood-stock, descendants, lineage, offspring', as well as 'seed' in the vegetable sense. 'Silures' might therefore mean 'Kindred, Stock', perhaps referring to a tribal belief in a descent from an originating ancestor. Patrizia de Bernardo Stempel hypothesises that the Silures were originally referred to as silo-riks, 'rich in grain'.  Fierce resistance to Roman forces  Tribes of Wales at the time of the Roman invasion. The modern Welsh border is also shown, for reference purposes. The Silures fiercely resisted Roman conquest about AD 48, with the assistance of Caratacus, a military leader and prince of the Catuvellauni, who had fled from further east after his own tribe was defeated. The first attack on the Welsh tribes was by the legate Publius Ostorius Scapula about AD 48. Ostorius first attacked the Deceangli in the north-east of what is now Wales, who appear to have surrendered with little resistance. He spent several years campaigning against the Silures and the Ordovices. Their resistance was led by Caratacus, who had fled from the south-east (of what is now England) when it was conquered by the Romans. He first led the Silures, then moved to the territory of the Ordovices, where he was defeated by Ostorius in AD 51. The Silures were not subdued, however, and waged effective guerrilla warfare against the Roman forces. Ostorius had announced that they posed such a danger that they should be either exterminated or transplanted. His threats only increased the Silures' determination to resist. They surrounded and attacked a large legionary force occupied in building Roman forts in their territory; it was rescued by others only with difficulty and considerable loss. The Silures also took Roman prisoners as hostages and distributed them amongst their neighbouring tribes in order to bind them together and encourage resistance. Ostorius died with the Silures still unconquered. After his death, they defeated the Second Legion. It remains unclear whether the Silures were militarily defeated or simply agreed to come to terms, but Roman sources suggest rather opaquely that they were eventually subdued by Sextus Julius Frontinus in a series of campaigns ending about AD 78. The Roman Tacitus wrote of the Silures: non atrocitate, non clementia mutabatur ‚Äì the tribe \\"was changed neither by cruelty nor by clemency\\".  Romanization  To aid the Roman administration in keeping down local opposition, a legionary fortress (Isca, later Caerleon) was planted in the midst of tribal territory. The town of Venta Silurum (Caerwent, six miles west of Chepstow) was established in AD 75. It became a Romanized town, not unlike Calleva Atrebatum (Silchester), but smaller. An inscription shows that, under the Roman Empire, it was the capital of the Silures, whose ordo (local council) provided local government for the district. Its massive Roman walls still survive, and excavations have revealed a forum, a temple, baths, amphitheatre, shops, and many comfortable houses with mosaic floors, etc. In the late 1st and early 2nd centuries, the Silures were given some nominal independence and responsibility for local administration. As was standard practice, as revealed by inscriptions, the Romans matched their deities with local Silurian ones, and the local deity Ocelus was identified with Mars, the Roman god of war. Caerwent seems to have continued in use in the post-Roman period as a religious centre. The territory of the Silures later developed as the 5th-century Welsh kingdoms of Gwent, Brycheiniog, and Gwynll≈µg. Some theories concerning King Arthur make him a leader in this area. There is evidence of cultural continuity throughout the Roman period, from the Silures to the kingdom of Gwent in particular, as shown by leaders of Gwent using the name \\"Caradoc\\" in remembrance of the British hero Caratacus. The term \\"Silurian\\" Reference is occasionally made to this period of Celtic history by the use of terms such as \\"Silurian\\". The poet Henry Vaughan called himself a \\"Silurist\\", by virtue of his roots in South Wales. The geological period Silurian was first described by Roderick Murchison in rocks located in the original lands of the Silures, hence the name. That period postdates the Cambrian and Ordovician periods, whose names are also derived from ancient Wales.

Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978), was a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States. It upheld affirmative action, allowing race to be one of several factors in college admission policy. However, the court ruled that specific racial quotas, such as the 16 out of 100 seats set aside for minority students by the University of California, Davis School of Medicine, were impermissible.. Although the Supreme Court had outlawed segregation in schools, and had even ordered school districts to take steps to assure integration, the question of the legality of voluntary affirmative action programs initiated by universities remained unresolved. Proponents deemed such programs necessary to make up for past discrimination, while opponents believed they were illegal and a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. An earlier case that the Supreme Court had taken in an attempt to address the issue, DeFunis v. Odegaard (1974), was dismissed on procedural grounds. Allan P. Bakke (), an engineer and former Marine officer, sought admission to medical school, but was rejected for admission due in part to his age. Bakke was in his early 30s while applying, and therefore considered too old by at least two institutions. After twice being rejected by the University of California, Davis, he brought suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the school's affirmative action program. The California Supreme Court struck down the program as violative of the rights of white applicants and ordered Bakke admitted. The U.S. Supreme Court accepted the case amid wide public attention. The case fractured the court; the nine justices issued a total of six opinions. The judgment of the court was written by Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr.; two different blocs of four justices joined various parts of Powell's opinion. Finding diversity in the classroom to be a compelling state interest, Powell opined that affirmative action in general was allowed under the Constitution and the Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Nevertheless, UC Davis's program went too far for a majority of justices, and it was struck down and Bakke admitted. The practical effect of Bakke was that most affirmative action programs continued without change. Questions about whether the Bakke case was merely a plurality opinion or binding precedent were answered in 2003 when the court upheld Powell's position in a majority opinion in Grutter v. Bollinger.  Background = State of the law = In Brown v. Board of Education (1954), the Supreme Court of the United States ruled segregation by race in public schools to be unconstitutional. In the following fifteen years, the court issued landmark rulings in cases involving race and civil liberties, but left supervision of the desegregation of Southern schools mostly to lower courts.Wilkinson, p. 79. Among other progressive legislation, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964,Wilkinson, p. 24. Title VI of which forbids racial discrimination in any program or activity receiving federal funding.Ball, p. 6. By 1968, integration of public schools was well advanced. In that year, the Supreme Court revisited the issue of school desegregation in Green v. County School Board, ruling that it was not enough to eliminate racially discriminatory practices; state governments were under an obligation to actively work to desegregate schools.Green v. County School Board, 391 U.S. 430 (1968). The school board in Green had allowed children to attend any school, but few chose to attend those dominated by another race.Green, 391 U.S. at 441. In 1970, in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, the Supreme Court upheld an order for busing of students to desegregate a school system.Schwartz, pp. 28‚Äì29.Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1 (1970). Although public universities were integrated by court decree, selective colleges and graduate programs, and the professions which stemmed from them, remained almost all white. Many African-Americans had attended inferior schools and were ill-prepared to compete in the admissions process. This was unsatisfactory to many activists of the late 1960s, who protested that given the African-American's history of discrimination and poverty, some preference should be given to minorities. This became a commonly held liberal position, and large numbers of public and private universities began affirmative action programs.Ball, pp. 3‚Äì10. Among these were the University of California, Davis School of Medicine (UC Davis or \\"the university\\"), which was founded in 1968 and had an all-white inaugural class. The faculty was concerned by this, and the school began a special admissions program \\"to compensate victims of unjust societal discrimination\\".Bakke, 238 U.S. at 272‚Äì275. The application form contained a question asking if the student wished to be considered disadvantaged, and, if so, these candidates were screened by a special committee, on which more than half the members were from minority groups.Bakke, 238 U.S. at 274. Initially, the entering class was 50 students, and eight seats were put aside for minorities; when the class size doubled in 1971, there were 16 seats which were to be filled by candidates recommended by the special committee.Bakke, 438 U.S. at 275. While nominally open to whites, no one of that race was admitted under the program, which was unusual in that a specific number of seats were to be filled by candidates through this program.Schwartz, p. 4. The first case taken by the Supreme Court on the subject of the constitutionality of affirmative action in higher education was DeFunis v. Odegaard (1974).DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U.S. 312 (1974). Marco DeFunis, a white man, had twice been denied admission to the University of Washington School of Law. The law school maintained an affirmative action program, and DeFunis had been given a higher rating by admissions office staff than some admitted minority candidates. The Washington state trial court ordered DeFunis admitted, and he attended law school while the case was pending. The Washington Supreme Court reversed the trial court, but the order was stayed, and DeFunis remained in school. The U.S. Supreme Court granted review and the case was briefed and argued, but by then, DeFunis was within months of graduation. The law school stated in its briefs that even if it won, it would not dismiss him.DeFunis, 416 U.S. at 314‚Äì317. After further briefing on the question of mootness, the Supreme Court dismissed the case, 5-4, holding that as DeFunis had almost completed his studies, there was no longer a case or controversy to decide.DeFunis, 416 U.S. at 319‚Äì320. Justice William Brennan, in an opinion joined by the other three members of the minority, accused the court of \\"sidestepping\\" the issues, which \\"must inevitably return to the federal courts and ultimately again to this court\\".Ball, pp. 22‚Äì45.DeFunis, 416 U.S. at 350. = Allan Bakke = Allan Paul Bakke (born 1940), a white male, applied to twelve medical schools in 1973. He had been a National Merit Scholar at Coral Gables Senior High School, in Coral Gables, Florida. Bakke attended the University of Minnesota for his undergraduate studies, deferring tuition costs by joining the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps. He graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1963 with a 3.51 GPA. In order to fulfill his ROTC requirements, he joined the Marine Corps and served four years, including a seven-month tour of duty in Vietnam as a commanding officer of an anti-aircraft battery. In 1967, having achieved the rank of captain, he was granted an honorable discharge. Bakke then worked as an engineer at NASA. He stated that his interest in medicine started in Vietnam, and increased at NASA, as he had to consider the problems of space flight and the human body there. But twelve medical schools rejected his application for admission. Bakke had applied first to the University of Southern California and Northwestern University, in 1972, and both rejected him, making a point of his age, with Northwestern writing that it was above their limit. Medical schools at the time openly practiced age discrimination. Bakke applied late to UC Davis in 1973 because his mother-in-law was ill.Santa Clara Law Review, p. 231. This delay may well have cost him admission: although his credentials were outstanding even among applicants not part of the special program, by the time his candidacy was considered under the school's rolling admissions process, there were few seats left.Schwartz, p. 5. His application reflected his anxiety about his age, referring to his years of sacrifice for his country as a cause of his interest in medicine. Bakke received 468 points out of a possible 500 on the admissions committee's rating scale in 1973. Earlier in the year, a rating of 470 had won automatic admission with some promising applicants being admitted with lower scores. Bakke had a science GPA of 3.44 and an overall GPA of 3.46 after taking science courses at night to qualify for medical school. On the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT), Bakke scored in the 97th percentile in scientific knowledge, the 96th percentile in verbal ability, the 94th percentile in quantitative analysis, and the 72nd percentile in general knowledge.Bakke, 438 U.S. at 276. Bakke's MCAT score overall was 72; the average applicant to UC Davis scored a 69 and the average applicant under the special program a 33.Ball, p. 52. In March 1973, Bakke was invited to UC Davis for an interview. Dr. Theodore West, who met with him, described Bakke as ‚Äúa well-qualified candidate for admission whose main hardship is the unavoidable fact that he is now 33. ‚Ä¶ On the grounds of motivation, academic records, potential promise, endorsement by persons capable of reasonable judgments, personal appearance and decorum, maturity, and probable contribution to balance in the class, I believe Mr. Bakke must be considered as a very desirable applicant and I shall so recommend him.‚Äù About two months later in May 1973, Bakke received notice of his rejection. Bakke complained to Dr. George Lowrey, chairman of the admissions committee at the medical school, about the special admissions program. At Lowrey's request, Assistant Dean Peter Storandt told Bakke his candidacy had come close and encouraged him to reapply. If he was not accepted the second time, \\"he could then research the legal question. He had been a good candidate. I thought he'd be accepted and that would end the matter.\\"Benfell, pp. 17, 52‚Äì54. Storandt also gave Bakke the names of two lawyers interested in the issue of affirmative action. The general counsel for the University of California said, \\"I don't think Storandt meant to injure the university. It's simply an example of a non-lawyer advising on legal matters.\\" Storandt stated, \\"I simply gave Allan the response you'd give an irate customer, to try and cool his anger. I realized the university might be vulnerable to legal attack because of its quota, and I had the feeling by then that somebody somewhere would sue the school, but I surely didn't know this would be the case.\\" Storandt was demoted and later left the university. According to Bernard Schwartz in his account of the Bakke case, Storandt was fired.Schwartz, pp. 6‚Äì7. Allan Bakke applied to UC Davis medical school again in 1974. He was interviewed twice: once by a student interviewer, who recommended his admission, and once by Dr. Lowrey, who in his report stated that Bakke \\"had very definite opinions which were based more on his personal viewpoints than on a study of the whole problem ‚Ä¶ He was very unsympathetic to the concept of recruiting minority students.\\"Schwartz, pp. 7‚Äì8. Lowrey gave Bakke a poor evaluation, the only part of his application on which he did not have a high score.Schwartz, p. 8. He was rejected again, although minorities were admitted in both years with significantly lower academic scores through the special program. Not all minority applicants whose admission was recommended under the program gained entry‚Äîsome were rejected by the admissions committee. This, however, did not affect the number of minority students to be admitted, sixteen. Although 272 white people between 1971 and 1974 had applied under this program, none had been successful; in 1974 the special admissions committee summarily rejected all white students who asked for admission under the program. Only one black student and six Latinos were admitted under the regular admissions program in that time period, though significant numbers of Asian students were given entry.Bakke, 438 U.S. at 275‚Äì276. According to a 1976 Los Angeles Times article, the dean of the medical school sometimes intervened on behalf of daughters and sons of the university's \\"special friends\\" in order to improve their chances. Among those who benefitted by Dean C. John Tupper's interventions (about five per year) was the son of an influential state assemblyman, who had not even filed an application. The special picks were ended by order of University of California President David S. Saxon in 1976. Bakke's lawyer deemed it impossible to tell if these picks caused Bakke not to be admitted, but according to an attorney who filed an amicus curiae brief on behalf of the National Urban League in support of affirmative action, the practice of dean's picks made the university reluctant to go into detail about its admission practices at trial, affecting its case negatively. = Lower court history = On June 20, 1974,Complete Case Record, p. 7. following his second rejection from UC Davis, Bakke brought suit against the university's governing board in the Superior Court of California,Bakke, 438 U.S. at 277. Yolo County. He sought an order admitting him on the ground that the special admission programs for minorities violated the U.S. and California constitutions, and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. UC Davis's counsel filed a request that the judge, F. Leslie Manker, find that the special program was constitutional and legal, and argued that Bakke would not have been admitted even if there had been no seats set aside for minorities. On November 20, 1974, Judge Manker found the program unconstitutional and in violation of Title VI, \\"no race or ethnic group should ever be granted privileges or immunities not given to every other race.\\"Ball, pp. 56‚Äì57. Manker ordered the medical school to disregard race as a factor, and to reconsider Bakke's application under a race-free system. After Manker entered final judgment in the case on March 7, 1975, both parties appealed, the university on March 20 because the program was struck down, and Bakke on April 17 because he was not ordered admitted.Ball, p. 58. Because of the important issues presented, the Supreme Court of California on June 26, 1975 ordered the appeal transferred to it, bypassing the intermediate appeals court.Bakke, 438 U.S. at 279.Schwartz, pp. 18‚Äì19. On March 19, 1976, the case was argued before the state supreme court.Schwartz, p. 19. Nine amicus curiae briefs were filed by various organizations, the majority in support of the university's position. The California Supreme Court was considered one of the most liberal appellate courts, and it was widely expected that it would find the program to be legal. Nevertheless, on September 16, 1976, the court, in an opinion by Justice Stanley Mosk, upheld the lower-court ruling, 6‚Äì1.Ball, pp. 58‚Äì60.Bakke v. Regents of the University of California, 18 Cal. 3d 34, 132 Cal. Rptr. 680, 553 P.2d 1152 (1976). Mosk wrote that \\"no applicant may be rejected because of his race, in favor of another who is less qualified, as measured by standards applied without regard to race\\".Bakke, 438 U.S. at 279‚Äì280.Bakke, 18 Cal. 3d at 55. Justice Matthew O. Tobriner dissented, stating that Mosk's suggestion that the state open more medical schools to accommodate both white and minority was unrealistic due to cost: \\"It is a cruel hoax to deny minorities participation in the medical profession on the basis of such fanciful speculation.\\"Stevens, p. 24.Bakke, 18 Cal. 3d at 90. The court barred the university from using race in the admissions process and ordered it to provide evidence that Bakke would not have been admitted under a race-neutral program. When the university conceded its inability to do so in a petition for rehearing, the court on October 28, 1976 amended its ruling to order Bakke's admission and denied the petition.Bakke, 438 U.S. at 280.Bakke, 18 Cal. 3d at 64.  U.S. Supreme Court consideration = Acceptance and briefs = alt=A somewhat indistinct photo on yellow paper of a crowded meeting room, showing student protesters with signs. In the front, several well-dressed individuals appear to be gathering papers and departing. The university requested that the U.S. Supreme Court stay the order requiring Bakke's admission pending its filing a petition asking for review. U.S. Supreme Court Justice William Rehnquist, as circuit justice for the Ninth Circuit (which includes California) granted the stay for the court in November 1976.Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 429 U.S. 953 (1976) (Rehnquist, J., as circuit justice, granting stay).Ball, p. 61. The university filed a petition for writ of certiorari in December 1976. The papers of some of the justices who participated in the Bakke case reveal that the case was three times considered by the court in January and February 1977. Four votes were needed for the court to grant certiorari, and it had at least that number each time, but was twice put over for reconsideration at the request of one of the justices. A number of civil rights organizations filed a joint brief as amicus curiae, urging the court to deny review, on the grounds that the Bakke trial had failed to fully develop the issues‚Äîthe university had not introduced evidence of past discrimination, or of bias in the MCAT. Nevertheless, on February 22, the court granted certiorari, with the case to be argued in its October 1977 term.Ball, pp. 64‚Äì67.Epstein & Knight, pp. 346‚Äì347. alt=a monochrome photo of a protest rally. Many of the protesters are minorities, and have Afro hairstyles. \\"WOMEN AGAINST BAKKE\\" is a typical sign being held. The parties duly filed their briefs. The university's legal team was now headed by former U.S. Solicitor General and Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox, who had argued many cases before the Supreme Court. Cox wrote much of the brief, and contended in it that \\"the outcome of this controversy will decide for future generations whether blacks, Chicanos and other insular minorities are to have meaningful access to higher education and real opportunities to enter the learned professions\\".Ball, pp. 68‚Äì69. The university also took the position that Bakke had been rejected because he was unqualified.Robert C. Barring, \\"Introduction to the Bakke case\\" in Complete Case Record at xxi‚Äìxxiv. Reynold Colvin, for Bakke, argued that his client's rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to equal protection of the laws had been violated by the special admission program.Ball, pp. 69‚Äì70. Fifty-eight amicus curiae briefs were filed, establishing a record for the Supreme Court that would stand until broken in the 1989 abortion case Webster v. Reproductive Health Services. Future justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg signed the ACLU's brief; Marco deFunis, the petitioner in the 1974 case dismissed for mootness, wrote the brief for Young Americans for Freedom.Ball, pp. 76‚Äì83. In addition to the various other amici, the United States filed a brief through the Solicitor General, as it may without leave of court under the Supreme Court's rules. When consideration of Bakke began in the new administration of President Jimmy Carter, early drafts of the brief both supported affirmative action and indicated that the program should be struck down and Bakke admitted. This stance reflected the mixed support of affirmative action at that time by the Democrats. Minorities and others in that party complained, and in late July 1977, Carter announced that the government's brief would firmly support affirmative action. That document, filed October 3, 1977 (nine days before oral argument), stated that the government supported programs tailored to make up for past discrimination, but opposed rigid set-asides. The United States urged the court to remand the case to allow for further fact-finding (a position also taken by civil rights groups in their amicus briefs).Ball, pp. 74‚Äì77. While the case was awaiting argument, another white student, Rita Clancy, sued for admission to UC Davis Medical School on the same grounds as Bakke had. In September 1977, she was ordered admitted pending the outcome of the Bakke case. After Bakke was decided, the university dropped efforts to oust her, stating that as she had successfully completed one year of medical school, she should remain. = Argument and deliberation = alt=a flyer informing the public of a rally against Bakke set for October 3, 1977 in San Francisco. There is a logo, showing tilted scales of justice and the legend, \\"Bury Bakke in October\\". Oral argument in Bakke took place on October 12, 1977. There was intense public interest in the case; prospective attendees began to line up the afternoon before. The court session took two hours, with Cox arguing for the university, Colvin for Bakke, and Solicitor General Wade H. McCree for the United States.Schwartz, pp. 47‚Äì52. Colvin was admonished by Justice Byron White for arguing the facts, rather than the Constitution.(registration required) Cox provided one of the few moments of levity during the argument when Justice Harry A. Blackmun wondered whether the set-aside seats could be compared to athletic scholarships. Cox was willing to agree, but noted that he was a Harvard graduate, and as for sporting success, \\"I don't know whether it's our aim, but we don't do very well.\\"Schwartz, p. 48. thumb Beginning the day after the argument, the justices lobbied each other through written memorandum.Epstein & Knight, pp. 347‚Äì349. At a conference held among justices on October 15, 1977, they decided to request further briefing from the parties on the applicability of Title VI.Ball, pp. 103‚Äì104. The supplemental brief for the university was filed on November 16, and argued that Title VI was a statutory version of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and did not allow private plaintiffs, such as Bakke, to pursue a claim under it. Bakke's brief arrived the following day. Colvin submitted that Bakke did have a private right of action, and that his client did not want the university to suffer the remedy prescribed under Title VI for discriminatory institutions‚Äîloss of federal funding‚Äîbut wanted to be admitted.Ball, pp. 105‚Äì106. In November, Justice Blackmun left Washington to have prostate surgery at the Mayo Clinic.Ball, p. 107. Blackmun's absence did not stem the flow of memos, notably one on November 22 from Justice Lewis Powell, analyzing the minority admissions program under the strict scrutiny standard often applied when government treats some citizens differently from others based on a suspect classification such as race. Concluding that the program did not meet the standard, and must be struck down, Powell's memorandum stated that affirmative action was permissible under some circumstances, and eventually formed much of his released opinion.Schwartz, pp. 81‚Äì85. At the justices' December 9 conference, with Blackmun still absent, they considered the case. Counting heads, four justices (Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Justices Potter Stewart, Rehnquist, and John Paul Stevens) favored affirming the California Supreme Court's decision. Three (Justices Brennan, White, and Thurgood Marshall) wanted to uphold the program. Justice Blackmun had not yet weighed in. Powell stated his views, after which Brennan, hoping to cobble together a five-justice majority to support the program, or at least to support the general principle of affirmative action, suggested to Powell that applying Powell's standard meant that the lower court decision would be affirmed in part and reversed in part. Powell agreed.Schwartz, pp. 98‚Äì107. Even when Blackmun returned in early 1978, he was slow to make his position on Bakke known. It was not until May 1 that he circulated a memorandum to his colleagues's chambers, indicating that he would join Brennan's bloc, in support of affirmative action and the university's program. This meant that Powell was essential to either side being part of a majority. Over the following eight weeks, Powell fine-tuned his opinion to secure the willingness of each group to join part of it. The other justices began work on opinions that would set forth their views.Schwartz, pp. 120‚Äì141. = Decision = Justice alt=monochrome photographic portrait of a white man in late middle age in judicial robes. He wears glasses and has thinning hair. The Supreme Court's decision in Bakke was announced on June 28, 1978. The justices penned six opinions; none of them, in full, had the support of a majority of the court. In a plurality opinion, Justice Powell delivered the judgment of the court. Four justices (Burger, Stewart, Rehnquist, and Stevens) joined with him to strike down the minority admissions program and admit Bakke. The other four justices (Brennan, White, Marshall, and Blackmun) dissented from that portion of the decision, but joined with Powell to find affirmative action permissible under some circumstances, though subject to an intermediate scrutiny standard of analysis. They also joined with Powell to reverse that portion of the judgment of the California Supreme Court that forbade the university to consider race in the admissions process.Bakke, 438 U.S. at 265‚Äì272.  Powell's opinion  Justice Powell, after setting forth the facts of the case, discussed and found it unnecessary to decide whether Bakke had a private right of action under Title VI, assuming that was so for purposes of the case.Bakke, 438 U.S. at 272‚Äì284. He then discussed the scope of Title VI, opining that it barred only those racial classifications forbidden by the Constitution.Bakke, 438 U.S. at 284‚Äì287. Turning to the program itself, Powell determined that it was not simply a goal, as the university had contended, but a racial qualification‚Äîassuming that UC Davis could find sixteen minimally qualified minority students, there were only 84 seats in the freshman class open to white students, whereas minorities could compete for any spot in the 100-member class. He traced the history of the jurisprudence under the Equal Protection Clause, and concluded that it protected all, not merely African Americans or only minorities. Only if it served a compelling interest could the government treat members of different races differently.Bakke, 438 U.S. at 287‚Äì299. Powell noted that the university, in its briefs, had cited decisions where there had been race-conscious remedies, such as in the school desegregation cases, but found them inapposite as there was no history of racial discrimination at the University of California-Davis Medical School to remedy. He cited precedent that when an individual was entirely foreclosed from opportunities or benefits provided by the government and enjoyed by those of a different background or race, this was a suspect classification. Such discrimination was only justifiable when necessary to a compelling governmental interest. He rejected assertions by the university that government had a compelling interest in boosting the number of minority doctors, and deemed too nebulous the argument that the special admissions program would help bring doctors to underserved parts of California‚Äîafter all, that purpose would also be served by admitting white applicants interested in practicing in minority communities. Nevertheless, Powell opined that government had a compelling interest in a racially diverse student body.Bakke, 438 U.S. at 300‚Äì315. In a part of the opinion concurred in by Chief Justice Burger and his allies, Powell found that the program, with its set-aside of a specific number of seats for minorities, did discriminate against Bakke, as less restrictive programs, such as making race one of several factors in admission, would serve the same purpose. Powell offered the example (set out in an appendix) of the admissions program at Harvard University as one he believed would pass constitutional muster‚Äîthat institution did not set rigid quotas for minorities, but actively recruited them and sought to include them as more than a token part of a racially and culturally diverse student body. Although a white student might still lose out to a minority with lesser academic qualifications, both white and minority students might gain from non- objective factors such as the ability to play sports or a musical instrument. Accordingly, there was no constitutional violation in using race as one of several factors.Ball, pp. 137‚Äì139.Bakke, 438 U.S. at 300‚Äì320. Powell opined that because the university had admitted that it could not prove that Bakke would not have been admitted even had there been no special admissions program, the portion of the California Supreme Court's decision ordering Bakke's admission was proper, and was upheld. Nevertheless, the state was entitled to consider race as one of several factors, and the portion of the California court's judgment which had ordered the contrary was overruled.Bakke, 438 U.S. at 320‚Äì321.  Other opinions  Brennan delivered the joint statement of four justices: Marshall, White, Blackmun and himself. In verbally introducing their opinion in the Supreme Court courtroom, Brennan stated that the \\"central meaning\\" of the Bakke decision was that there was a majority of the court in favor of the continuation of affirmative action.Schwartz, pp. 146‚Äì147. In the joint opinion, those four justices wrote, \\"government may take race into account when it acts not to demean or insult any racial group, but to remedy disadvantages cast on minorities by past racial prejudice\\".Bakke, 438 U.S. at 325. They suggested that any admissions program with the intention of remedying past race discrimination would be constitutional, whether that involved adding bonus points for race, or setting aside a specific number of places for them.Bakke, 438 U.S. at 378. White issued an opinion expressing his view that there was not a private right of action under Title VI.Ball, p. 140.Bakke, 438 U.S. at 387. Thurgood Marshall also wrote separately, recounting at length the history of discrimination against African-Americans, and concluding, \\"I do not believe that anyone can truly look into America's past and still find that a remedy for the effects of that past is impermissible.\\"Ball, pp. 139‚Äì140. Blackmun subscribed to the idea of color consciousness, declaring that, \\"in order to get beyond racism, we must first take account of race. There is no other way. And in order to treat some persons equally, we must treat them differently. We cannot‚Äîwe dare not‚Äîlet the Equal Protection Clause perpetuate racial superiority.\\"Bakke, 438 U.S. at 407. Justice Stevens, joined by Burger, Stewart and Rehnquist, concurring in part and dissenting in part in the judgment, found it unnecessary to determine whether a racial preference was ever allowed under the Constitution. A narrow finding that the university had discriminated against Bakke, violating Title VI, was sufficient, and the court was correct to admit him.Bakke, 438 U.S. at 409‚Äì411. \\"It is therefore perfectly clear that the question whether race can ever be used as a factor in an admissions decision is not an issue in this case, and that discussion of that issue is inappropriate.\\"Bakke, 438 U.S. at 411. According to Stevens, \\"[t]he meaning of the Title VI ban on exclusion is crystal clear: Race cannot be the basis of excluding anyone from a federally funded program\\".Bakke, 438 U.S. at 418. He concluded, \\"I concur in the Court's judgment insofar as it affirms the judgment of the Supreme Court of California. To the extent that it purports to do anything else, I respectfully dissent.\\"Bakke, 438 U.S. at 421.  Reaction  Newspapers stressed different aspects of Bakke, often reflecting their political ideology. The conservative Chicago Sun-Times bannered Bakke's admission in its headline, while noting that the court had permitted affirmative action under some circumstances. The Washington Post, a liberal newspaper, began its headline in larger-than-normal type, \\"Affirmative Action Upheld\\" before going on to note that the court had admitted Bakke and curbed quotas.Ball, pp. 140‚Äì141. The Wall Street Journal, in a headline, deemed Bakke \\"The Decision Everybody Won\\".Schwartz, pp. 151‚Äì152. According to Oxford University Chair of Jurisprudence Ronald Dworkin, the court's decision \\"was received by the press and much of the public with great relief, as an act of judicial statesmanship that gave to each party in the national debate what it seemed to want most\\".Ronald Dworkin, \\"The Bakke decision: did it decide anything?\\" in Complete Case Record at xxv‚Äìxxxiv. Attorney General Griffin Bell, after speaking with President Jimmy Carter, stated, \\"my general view is that affirmative action has been enhanced\\", and that such programs in the federal government would continue as planned. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Chair Eleanor Holmes Norton told the media \\"that the Bakke case has not left me with any duty to instruct the EEOC staff to do anything different\\".Ball, pp. 142‚Äì143. Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe wrote in 1979, \\"the Court thus upheld the kind of affirmative action plan used by most American colleges and universities, and disallowed only the unusually mechanical‚Äîsome would say unusually candid, others would say unusually impolitic‚Äîapproach taken by the Medical School\\" of UC Davis.Tribe, p. 864. Robert M. O'Neil wrote in the California Law Review the same year that only rigid quotas were foreclosed to admissions officers and even \\"relatively subtle changes in the process by which applications were reviewed, or in the resulting minority representation, could well produce a different alignment [of justices]\\".O'Neil, p. 144. Law professor and future judge Robert Bork wrote in the pages of The Wall Street Journal that the justices who had voted to uphold affirmative action were \\"hard-core racists of reverse discrimination\\".Ball, p. 142. Allan Bakke had given few interviews during the pendency of the case, and on the day it was decided, went to work as usual in Palo Alto. He issued a statement through attorney Colvin expressing his pleasure in the result and that he planned to begin his medical studies that fall.Ball, p. 143. Most of the lawyers and university personnel who would have to deal with the aftermath of Bakke doubted the decision would change very much. The large majority of affirmative action programs at universities, unlike that of the UC Davis medical school, did not use rigid numerical quotas for minority admissions and could continue.(subscription required) According to Bernard Schwartz in his account of Bakke, the Supreme Court's decision \\"permits admission officers to operate programs which grant racial preferences‚Äîprovided that they do not do so as blatantly as was done under the sixteen-seat 'quota' provided at Davis\\".Schwartz, p. 153.  Aftermath  Allan Bakke, \\"America's best known freshman\\", enrolled at the UC Davis medical school on September 25, 1978. Seemingly oblivious to the questions of the press and the shouts of protesters, he stated only \\"I am happy to be here\\" before entering to register. When the university declined to pay his legal fees, Bakke went to court, and on January 15, 1980, was awarded $183,089. Graduating from the UC Davis medical school in 1982 at age 42, he went on to a career as an anesthesiologist at the Mayo Clinic and at the Olmsted Medical Group in Rochester, Minnesota.Ball, p. 46. In 1996, Californians by initiative banned the state's use of race as a factor to consider in public schools' admission policies. The university's Board of Regents, led by Ward Connerly, voted to end race as a factor in admissions. The regents, to secure a diverse student body, implemented policies such as allowing the top 4% of students in California high schools guaranteed admission to the University of California SystemBall, p. 164.‚Äîthis, it was felt, would aid minority inner-city students. Dworkin warned in 1978 that \\"Powell's opinion suffers from fundamental weaknesses, and if the Court is to arrive at a coherent position, far more judicial work remains to be done than a relieved public yet realizes\\". The Supreme Court has continued to grapple with the question of affirmative action in higher education. In the 2003 case of Grutter v. Bollinger, it reaffirmed Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke in a majority opinion, thus rendering moot concerns expressed by lower courts that Bakke might not be binding precedent due to the fractured lineup of justices in a plurality opinion.Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306 (2003). The court's decision in the 2013 case of Fisher v. University of Texas made alterations to the standards by which courts must judge affirmative action programs, but continued to permit race to be taken into consideration in university admissions, while forbidding outright quotas.Fisher v. University of Texas, 133 S. Ct. 2411 (2013).  See also  *Civil Rights Movement  Notes and references  Notes: References: = Bibliography =   * .  External links * *Regents of Univ. Cal v.

It is made by forming various pureed deboned white fish with either natural or man-made additives and flavorings into distinctive loaves, which are then steamed until fully cooked and firm. These are sliced and either served unheated (or chilled) with various dipping sauces, or added to various hot soups, rice, or noodle dishes. Kamaboko is often sold in semicylindrical loaves, some featuring artistic patterns, such as the pink spiral on each slice of narutomaki, named after the well-known tidal whirlpool near the Japanese city of Naruto. In Miyagi Prefecture, is a regional kamaboko variation, pale white in colour, formed in the shape of bamboo leaves and often lightly grilled immediately prior to serving. There is no precise English translation for kamaboko. Rough equivalents are 'fish paste', 'fish loaf', 'fish cake', and 'fish sausage'. Tsuji recommends using the Japanese name in English (e.g., 'sushi'). The Ashkenazi Jewish dish gefilte fish has some similarity.Mouritsen, Ole (2017). Mouthfeel: How Texture Makes Taste. Columbia University Press, New York. Red- skinned and white kamaboko are typically served at celebratory and holiday meals, as red and white are considered to bring good luck. Kamaboko has been made in Japan since the 14th century AD and is now available nearly worldwide. The simulated crab meat product kanikama (short for kani-kamaboko) is the best-known form of surimi in the West. In Japan, the prepackaged snack chƒ´kama (cheese plus kamaboko) is commonly sold in convenience stores. In the city of Uwajima, a type of fried kamaboko called jakoten is popular.

They entered liquidation in May 2020, having been previously in liquidation and taken over in 2011. After the Second World War, the Car Division of the Bristol Aeroplane Company was formed, later becoming Bristol Cars Limited. Bristol had only one sales showroom, on the corner of Kensington High Street and Holland Road in London. Bristol had always been a low-volume manufacturer; the most recent published official production figures were for 1982, which stated that 104 cars were produced in that year. The company suspended manufacturing in March 2011, when administrators were appointed, 22 staff were made redundant at the factory in Filton, Bristol and subsequently the company was dissolved. In April 2011, a new company was formed by the administrator to sell the original assets to Kamkorp. Since 2011, the company has been restoring and selling all models of the marque while a new model was being developed. The company had revealed a desire to return to automotive production in 2018 with an all-new model, called the \\"Bullet\\", initially dubbed \\"Project Pinnacle\\". The car was first revealed to the public on 26 July 2016, and homologation was set to have begun some time in 2018. History The Bristol Cars showroom on Kensington High Street The British aircraft industry suffered a dramatic loss of orders and great financial difficulties following the Armistice of 1918. To provide immediate employment for its considerable workforce, the Bristol Aeroplane Company undertook the manufacture of a light car (the Bristol Monocar), the construction of car bodies for Armstrong Siddeley and bus bodies for their sister company, Bristol Tramways. On the outbreak of World War II, Sir George Stanley White, managing director of the Bristol Aeroplane Company from 1911‚Äì1954, was determined not to suffer the same difficulties a second time. The company now employed 70,000 and he knew he must plan for the time when the voracious wartime demand for Bristol aircraft and aircraft engines would suddenly end. The company began working with AFN Ltd, makers of Frazer Nash cars and British importer of BMWs before the war, on plans for a joint venture in automotive manufacture. Sir George Stanley White with the Bristol 450 Le Mans cars As early as 1941, a number of papers were written or commissioned by George S. M. White, Sir Stanley's son, proposing a post-war car manufacturing division. It was decided to purchase an existing manufacturer for this purpose. Alvis, Aston Martin, Lagonda, ERA and Lea-Francis were considered. =Beginning= A chance discussion took place in May 1945, between D. A. Aldington, a director of Frazer Nash then serving as an inspector for the wartime Ministry of Aircraft Production (MAP), and Eric Storey, an assistant of George White at the Bristol Aeroplane Company. It led to the immediate take-over of Frazer Nash by the Aeroplane Company. Aldington and his two brothers had marketed the Frazer Nash BMW before the war, and proposed to build an updated version after demobilisation. This seemed the perfect match for the aeroplane company's own ambitions to manufacture a high quality sports car. With the support of the War Reparations Board, H. J. Aldington travelled to Munich and purchased the rights to manufacture three BMW models and the 328 engine. By July 1945, BAC had created a car division and bought a controlling stake in AFN. A factory was established at Filton Aerodrome, near Bristol. 1952 Bristol 401 The Bristol Britannia (seen here) was produced from 1982 to 1993 and was replaced by the Blenheim. George White and Reginald Verdon-Smith of the Aeroplane Company joined the new Frazer Nash Board, but in January 1947, soon after the first cars had been produced, differences between the Aldingtons and Bristol led to the resale of Frazer Nash. The Bristol Car Division became an independent entity. =Independence= Bristol Cars was sold after its parent joined with other British aircraft companies in 1960 to create the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC), which later became part of British Aerospace. The car division originally merged with Bristol Siddeley Engines, and was marked for closure, but was bought in September 1960 by George S.M. White the chairman and effective founder. White retained the direction of the company, but sold a forty per cent shareholding to Tony Crook, a leading Bristol agent. Crook became sole distributor. =New ownership= In September 1969, only a month before the unveiling of the new Bristol 411 at the Earl's Court Motor Show, Sir George White (as he had become) suffered a serious accident in his Bristol 410. The car was only superficially damaged, but he suffered severe trauma. As time passed it became clear that he would never regain his health sufficiently to return to full-time work. To safeguard the future of his workforce, he decided in 1973 to sell his majority shareholding to Crook. As the ties with the White family were severed, British Aerospace (successors to the Bristol Aeroplane Company) requested the company to move its factory from Filton Aerodrome and it found new premises in nearby Patchway. The showroom on Kensington High Street became the head office, with Crook shuttling between the two in Bristol's light aircraft. Under Crook's direction the company produced at least six types, the names of which were largely borrowed from Bristol's distinguished aeronautical past: the Beaufighter, Blenheim, Britannia and Brigand. =End of the second era= In February 1997, Crook, then aged 77, sold a fifty per cent holding in Bristol Cars to Toby Silverton, with an option to take full control within four years. Silverton, then son-in- law of Joe Lewis of the Tavistock Group and son of Arthur Silverton of Overfinch, joined the board with his father. Crook and Toby Silverton produced the Speedster, Bullet and 411 Series 6, though 2002 saw the transfer of Bristol Cars fully into the ownership of Silverton and the Tavistock Group, with Silverton in the chair and Crook remaining as managing director. Together they developed a V10 engined two-seater named after the first Sir George White's world-famous First World War two-seater aircraft, the Bristol Fighter. Crook finally relinquished his connection with Bristol Cars in August 2007. In March 2011, it was announced that Bristol Cars Limited had been placed into administration; it was that company that was renamed and subsequently dissolved by the administrator. Pre-war BMW designs, Aldington brothers and early cars Bristol 400, 1946‚Äì50 HJ Aldington, a director of the Bristol Aeroplane Company affiliated AFN (BMW's pre-war concessionaire in the UK), used his British Army connections to visit the bombed BMW factory in Munich several times post-war. In 1945 he took plans for BMW cars back to Britain, and BMW chief engineer, Dr. Fritz Fiedler was also employed. Its first car was the Bristol 400, prototyped in 1946 and introduced at the 1947 Geneva Motor Show. Derived from immediately pre-WW2 BMW products (thanks to a connection to BMW through Frazer Nash), the chassis was based on the BMW 326, the engine on the 328, and the body on the 327. Even a variation on the famous double-kidney BMW grille was retained. Bristol, however, did a thorough examination of the car's handling and ended up with performance \\"only matched by outright purpose-built competition cars\\". Seven hundred of the Bristol 400 were built, 17 of which received \\"handsome\\" drophead bodywork from Pininfarina. In 1949, the 400 was joined by the five-place 401. Bodied by Touring, it was aerodynamically sleeker, accelerated better, and had higher top speed. It was joined by the drophead 402, of which just 24 examples were built. The 403 followed in 1953, which featured improved brakes, gearbox, dampers, heater, and engine (a detuned racing motor, in fact). Bristol would use this same engine in the 450, entered at Le Mans in 1953; it broke its experimental crankshaft, but despite being less than aerodynamically ideal proved fully five seconds a lap quicker than the competition. Bristol withdrew from racing two years later. Along with the 403 was the 404, on a shorter wheelbase, with a more powerful engine and styling reminiscent of the 450. The 404 introduced a concealed front wing-mounted spare wheel and battery. It was built to extremely exacting standards, and the price reflected it; this, plus newly introduced \\"punitive taxation\\", meant only 40 were produced. Bristol's traditional wing-mounted spare wheel on a Bristol 410 The 405, which entered production in 1954, was much more successful, not least for being Bristol's only four-door. It remained in production until 1958, with 297 saloons and 43 drophead coup√©s produced in all. Bristol debuted the 406 in 1958, and it remained in production until 1961. =V8 cars= The 406's replacement, the 407, was powered by a 5.2-litre V8 provided by Chrysler of Canada. It was followed in 1963 by the 408, with drastic restyling as well as improved suspension. This was succeeded by the 409. Many buyers preferred the crisp steering and gearbox of the earlier six-cylinder cars. The 410, introduced in 1966, was a return to the high-performance touring tradition, offering the same top speed as the 409, and superior acceleration, with the same powerplant. It also saw Bristol become a private company and marked a return to quality to the exclusion of output: no more than three cars a week were to be made. 1968 Bristol 410 In 1969, the Bristol 411 appeared, with a new 6.2-litre Chrysler V8 (still rebuilt and modified by Bristol, as before) delivering higher top speed and even better acceleration. 1970 Bristol 411 Series 1 =Engines= Until 1961 all Bristol cars used Bristol-built derivatives of the BMW M328 2-litre six-cylinder engine. These engines also powered a number of sports and racing cars, including all post-war Frazer Nashes (apart from a few prototypes), some ACs, some Lotus and Cooper racing cars, and several others. In 1961, with the launch of the Bristol 407, the company switched to larger Chrysler V8 engines, which were more powerful than Bristol's own, BMW derived 2.25 litre 6 cylinder engine. The Chrysler V8s could be bought off the shelf from Canadian Chrysler without the startup costs of Bristol's own 3.65 litre all alloy 6 then in development. All post-1961 Bristols, including the later Blenheim and Fighter models, used Chrysler engines. Kamkorp era (2011‚Äì2020)=Administration and purchase= On 3 March 2011 it was announced that Bristol Cars had gone into administration, with the immediate loss of 22 jobs when the factory at Filton, Bristol was shut down. On 21 April 2011 another new company was formed to sell the assets of the former dissolved company, and it was this company that was purchased by Kamkorp, which also owns Frazer-Nash Research, a technology manufacturer of electric power systems. =Bristol Bullet= In 2015 Bristol Cars announced the development of a new model codenamed \\"Project Pinnacle\\". Initial reports indicated it would be a petrol-electric hybrid with a petrol engine from BMW. However a later media report and a May 2015 press release, indicated that the car would have non-hybrid V8 power. The car, a two-seater roadster, made its first public appearance, slightly camouflaged, at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in June 2016. In July, the car was shown undisguised, technical details were announced, and its name given as Bristol Bullet. However, since that date there has been no further news about the car's homologation, and many members of the sales and marketing team have recently left the company. It is said to be powered by a normally aspirated 4.8 litre BMW V8 engine (sharing the same drivetrain and chassis as the most recent Morgan Aero 8) driving the rear wheels, has a body of carbon fibre, weighs 1130 kg, and will cost ¬£95,000. The planned production run is said to be limited to 70 cars to commemorate the marque's 70th anniversary. = Winding-up = On 5 March, 2020 it was reported that Bristol cars has been officially wound up in order to pay creditors, with court-ordered liquidation now under way. The Bristol Owners Club working together with the Bristol Owners and Drivers Association and the Bristol Owners Heritage Trust is reported to be actively engaged in order to preserve the heritage and associated spares for the marque.https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/bristol-cars-loses-appeal- against-liquidation Models 1956 Bristol 405 Drop Head Coupe, coachwork by Abbots of Farnham 1974 Bristol 411 Series 4 Bristol 407 Zagato Bristol Fighter, 2004 =Bristol-engined cars= * Type 400 (1946‚Äì1950) * Type 401 (1948‚Äì1953) * Type 402 (1949‚Äì1950) * Type 403 (1953‚Äì1955) * Type 404 (1953‚Äì1955) * Type 404X Arnolt Bristol (1954‚Äì1958) * Type 405 (1954‚Äì1958) * Type 406 (1958‚Äì1961) * Type 450 (1953‚Äì1955) =Chrysler-engined cars= * Type 407 (1961‚Äì1963) * Type 408 (1963‚Äì1965) * Type 409 (1965‚Äì1967) * Type 410 (1967‚Äì1969) * Type 411 (1969‚Äì1976) * Type 412/Beaufighter (1975‚Äì1993) ** ** Beaufort * Type 603 (1976‚Äì1982) ** Britannia/Brigand (1982‚Äì1993) * Blenheim (1993‚Äì2011) ** Blenheim 2 ** Blenheim 3, 3S and 3G ** Blenheim 4 * Blenheim Roadster/Speedster (2003‚Äì2011) * Fighter (2004‚Äì2011) =BMW-engined cars= * Bullet (2016, one built) See also * Bristol Commercial Vehicles * List of car manufacturers of the United Kingdom References=Other sources=  External links * Bristol Cars Official Site * Bristol Owners Club (UK) * Bristol Owners & Drivers Association Category:British brands Category:Car manufacturers of the United Kingdom Category:Kensington Category:Luxury motor vehicle manufacturers Category:Manufacturing companies based in Bristol Category:1945 establishments in England Category:British companies established in 1945 Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1945 Category:Car brands Category:Formula One engine manufacturers ","title":"Bristol Cars"},{"id":"169487","text":"The European Union Police Mission (EUPM) was the European Union's mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina that aided the local police organizations, and was one of a number of European Union Police Missions worldwide. It was the first such mission undertaken by the EU within the framework of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. The EUPM was the successor to the United Nations International Police Task Force (part of the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina) in Bosnia, whose term ended at the end of 2002. The EUPM acted under co-ordination of the European Union Special Representative, who also served as High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina. The mission was ended on 30 June 2012. Mission The EUPM aimed to help in establishing a sustainable, professional and multi-ethnic police force. It assisted the local police, fighting large-scale organised crime and helping with police reform. EUPM, the first mission launched under the Common Security and Defence Policy, was launched on 1 January 2003 for an initial period of three years. Following an invitation by the Bosnian authorities, the EU decided to establish a follow-on police mission with a modified mandate and size. EUPM II lasted for two years (from 1 January 2006 until 31 December 2007). It monitored, advised and inspected BiH police forces according to three main pillars, i.e. support to the police reform process, strengthening of police accountability and supporting the fight against organised crime. At the end of 2007 the EU Police Mission was extended for another two years (from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2009). During those two years, the mission continued its work with regard to the three same pillars, with particular emphasis on the fight against organised crime. EUPM also devoted particular attention to reinforcing cooperation between police and prosecutors.

Most of the Don Camillo stories came out in the weekly magazine Candido, founded by Guareschi with Giovanni Mosca. These \\"Little World\\" (Italian: Mondo piccolo) stories amounted to 347 in total and were put together and published in eight books, only the first three of which were published when Guareschi was still alive. Don Camillo is a parish priest and is said to have been inspired by an actual Roman Catholic priest, World War II partisan and detainee at the concentration camps of Dachau and Mauthausen, named Don Camillo Valota (1912-1998)... Guareschi was also inspired by Don Alessandro Parenti, a priest of Trepalle, near the Swiss border. Peppone is the communist town mayor. The tensions between the two characters and their respective factions form the basis of the works' satirical plots. Characterisation Drawing of Don Camillo as depicted by Fernandel In the post-war years (after 1945), Don Camillo Tarocci (his full name, which he rarely uses) is the hotheaded priest of a small town in the Po valley in northern Italy. Don Camillo is a big man, tall and strong with hard fists. For the films, the town chosen to represent that of the books was Brescello (which currently has a museum dedicated to Don Camillo and Peppone) after the production of movies based on Guareschi's tales, but in the first story Don Camillo is introduced as the parish priest of Ponteratto. Don Camillo talking with Jesus Gino Cervi as Peppone Don Camillo is constantly at odds with the communist mayor, Giuseppe Bottazzi, better known as Peppone (meaning, roughly, Big Joe) and is also on very close terms with the crucifix in his town church. Through the crucifix he hears the voice of Christ.As the author notes in the preface of the first book, not the Christ, but \\"his\\" Christ, the voice of his conscience. The Christ in the crucifix often has far greater understanding than Don Camillo of the troubles of the people, and has to constantly but gently reprimand the priest for his impatience. What Peppone and Camillo have in common is an interest in the well-being of the town. They also appear to have both been partisan fighters during World War II; one episode mentions Camillo having braved German patrols in order to reach Peppone and his fellow Communists in the mountains and administer Mass to them under field conditions. While Peppone makes public speeches about how \\"the reactionaries\\" ought to be shot, and Don Camillo preaches fire and brimstone against \\"godless Communists\\", they actually grudgingly admire each other. Therefore, they sometimes end up working together in peculiar circumstances, though keeping up their squabbling. Thus, although he publicly opposes the Church as a Party duty, Peppone takes his gang to the church and baptises his children there, which makes him part of Don Camillo's flock; also, Peppone and other Communists are seen as sharing in veneration of the Virgin Mary and local Saints. Don Camillo also never condemns Peppone himself, but the ideology of communism which is in direct opposition to the church. As depicted in the stories, the Communists are the only political party with a mass grassroots organization in the town. The Italian Christian Democratic Party, the main force in Italian politics at the time, does not have a local political organization (at least, none is ever mentioned); rather, it is the Catholic Church which unofficially but very obviously plays that role. Don Camillo thus plays an explicitly political as well as religious role. For example, when the Communists organize a local campaign to sign the Stockholm Peace Appeal, it is Don Camillo who organizes a counter-campaign, and the townspeople take for granted that such a political campaign is part of his work as priest. Many stories are satirical and take on the real world political divide between the Italian Roman Catholic Church and the Italian Communist Party, not to mention other worldly politics. Others are tragedies about schism, politically motivated murder, and personal vendettas in a small town where everyone knows everyone else, but not everyone necessarily likes everyone else very much. Political forces other than the Communists and the Catholics have only a marginal presence. In one episode the local Communists are incensed at the announcement that the small Italian Liberal Party has scheduled an elections rally in their town, and mobilize in force to break it up ‚Äî only to discover virtually no local Liberals have turned up; the Liberal speaker, a middle-aged professor, speaks to a predominantly Communist audience and wins its grudging respect by his courage and determination. In one story, Don Camillo visits the Soviet Union, pretending to be a comrade. In another, the arrival of pop culture and motorcycles propels Don Camillo into fighting \\"decadence\\", a struggle in which he finds he has his hands full, especially when the Christ mainly smiles benevolently on the young rascals. In this later collection, Peppone is the proprietor of several profitable dealerships, riding the \\"Boom\\" years of the 1960s in Italy. He is no longer quite the committed Communist he once was, but he still does not get on with Don Camillo ‚Äî at least not in public. Don Camillo has his own problems ‚Äî the Second Vatican Council has brought changes in the Church, and a new assistant priest, who comes to be called Don Chich√¨, has been foisted upon him to see that Don Camillo moves with the times. Don Camillo, of course, has other ideas. Despite their bickering, the goodness and generosity of each character can be seen during hard times. They always understand and respect each other when one is in danger, when a flood devastates the town, when death takes a loved one, and in many other situations in which the two \\"political enemies\\" show their mutual respect for one another and fight side by side for the same ideals (even if they are each conditioned by their individual public roles in society). Guareschi created a second series of novels about a similar character, Don Candido, Archbishop of Trebilie (or Trebiglie, literally \\"three marble balls\\" or \\"three billiard balls\\"). The name of this fictional town is a play on words of Trepalle (literally \\"three balls\\"), a real town (near Livigno) whose priest was an acquaintance of Guareschi's.

The World of Don Camillo does not contain all the stories contained in the individual books. The Italian, US English and UK English publications often have a different number of stories within them. Media=Films= A series of black-and-white films were made between 1952 and 1965. These were French- Italian coproductions and were simultaneously released in both languages. Don Camillo was played by French actor Fernandel, Peppone by the Italian actor Gino Cervi, quite a Guareschi-lookalike, both tall and bulky with big mustaches. The author of the original stories was involved in the scripts and helped select the main actors. To this day, the films are screened in Europe. The titles were: *The Little World of Don Camillo (Italian: Don Camillo; French: Le Petit Monde de don Camillo) *The Return of Don Camillo (Italian: Il ritorno di don Camillo; French: Le Retour de don Camillo) *Don Camillo's Last Round (Italian: Don Camillo e l'onorevole Peppone; French: La Grande Bagarre) *Don Camillo: Monsignor (Italian: Don Camillo monsignore ma non troppo; French: Don Camillo Monseigneur) *Don Camillo in Moscow (Italian: Il compagno don Camillo; French: Don Camillo en Russie) Christian-Jaque began filming the French-Italian film Don Camillo e i giovani d'oggi in 1970 but had to stop filming due to Fernandel's falling ill, which resulted in his untimely death. The film was then realized in 1972 by Mario Camerini with Gastone Moschin playing the role of Don Camillo and Lionel Stander as Peppone. A Don Camillo (The World of Don Camillo; Italian: Don Camillo) film was remade in 1983, an Italian production with Terence Hill directing and also starring as Don Camillo. Colin Blakely performed Peppone in one of his last film roles. =Radio= A BBC Radio English-language radio dramatization of The Little World of Don Camillo was broadcast in 2001 starring Alun Armstrong as Don Camillo, John Moffatt as the Bishop, Shaun Prendergast as Peppone and Joss Ackland as God, and rebroadcast in July 2010 on BBC Radio 7. Four further BBC Radio series of The Little World of Don Camillo were made, with the final series broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in December 2006. Ian Hogg replaced Armstrong as Don Camillo, while Prendergast, Ackland and Moffatt all continued to reprise their roles as Peppone, God and the Bishop respectively. BBC Radio 7 broadcast the second and third series throughout August and September 2010 with the fourth series beginning on 6 October. =Television= In 1980, the BBC produced the television series The Little World of Don Camillo, based on the stories, starring Italian-German actor Mario Adorf as Don Camillo and Englishman Brian Blessed as Peppone. The narrator and Voice of the Christ was Cyril Cusack. In Colombia the stories were adapted into a TV comedy called Don Camilo. The Italian Communist era was changed to a Colombian period called \\"La Violencia\\" when the Liberal and Conservative parties were fighting to maintain power in Colombia. The comedy was produced from 1987 to 1988 by the now defunct Coestrellas company and produced and directed by Daniel Samper Pizano and Bernando Romero Pereiro. The series starred Carlos Benjumea as Don Camillo (Don Camilo in Colombian Spanish), Hector Rivas as Peppone (Pep√≥n in Colombian Spanish), Luis Fernando M√∫nera as The Christ Voice, and the actors Diego Le√≥n Hoyos and Manuel Pach√≥n as Peppone flunkies. The series was broadcast on Mondays at 10:00 pm by Cadena 2 (Se√±al Institucional now) and rebroadcast by Se√±al Colombia in 2011 and Canal Uno in 2014. =Thai novel= The Little World of Don Camillo was adapted by the Thai writer and politician Kukrit Pramoj into his own 1954 novel, Phai Daeng (Red Bamboo).

Life and career Giovannino Guareschi was born into a middle-class family in Fontanelle di Roccabianca, Province of Parma, in 1908. He always joked about the fact that he, a big man, was baptized Giovannino, a name meaning \\"little John\\" or \\"Johnny\\". In 1926 his family went bankrupt and he could not continue his studies at the University of Parma. After working at various minor jobs, he started to write for a local newspaper, the Gazzetta di Parma. In 1929 he became editor of the satirical magazine Corriere Emiliano, and from 1936 to 1943 he was the chief editor of a similar magazine called Bertoldo. In 1943 he was drafted into the army, which apparently helped him to avoid trouble with the fascist authorities. He ended up as an artillery officer. When Italy signed an armistice with the Allies in 1943, he was arrested as an Italian military internee and imprisoned with other Italian soldiers in camps in German-occupied Poland for almost two years, including at Stalag X-B near Sandbostel. He later wrote about this period in Diario Clandestino (My Secret Diary). After the war Guareschi returned to Italy and in 1945 founded a monarchist weekly satirical magazine, Candido. After Italy became a republic, he supported the Democrazia Cristiana party. He criticized and satirized the Communists in his magazine, famously drawing a Communist as a man with an extra nostril, and coining a slogan that became very popular: \\"Inside the voting booth God can see you, Stalin can't\\". When the Communists were soundly defeated in the 1948 Italian elections, Guareschi did not put his pen down but criticized the Democrazia Cristiana party as well. In 1950, Candido published a satirical cartoon by Carlo Manzoni poking fun at Luigi Einaudi, President of the Republic. The President is at the Quirinal Palace, surrounded by, instead of the presidential guard of honour (the corazzieri), by giant bottles of Nebbiolo wine, which Einaudi actually produced on his land in Dogliani. Each bottle was labeled with the institutional logo. The cartoon was judged 'in Contempt of the President' by a court at the time. Guareschi, as the director of the magazine, was held responsible and sentenced. Fernandel as Don Camillo In 1954 Guareschi was charged with libel after he published two facsimile wartime letters from resistance leader and former Prime Minister Alcide De Gasperi requesting that the Allies bomb the outskirts of Rome in order to demoralize German collaborators. The legitimacy of the letters was never established by the court, but after a two-month trial it found in favour of De Gasperi. Guareschi declined to appeal the verdict and spent 409 days in Parma's San Francesco jail, and another six months on probation at his home.Perry, 19-20 His most famous comic creations are his short stories, begun in the late 1940s, about the rivalry between Don Camillo, a stalwart Italian priest, and the equally hot-headed Peppone, Communist mayor of a Po River Valley village in the \\"Little World.\\" These stories were dramatized on radio, television and in films, most notably in the series of films featuring Fernandel as Don Camillo. By 1956 Guareschi's health had deteriorated and he began spending time in Switzerland for treatment. In 1957 he retired as editor of Candido but remained a contributor. He died in Cervia in 1968 of a heart attack, at age 60.

In this example the perianth is separated into a calyx (sepals) and corolla (petals) Petals are modified leaves that surround the reproductive parts of flowers. They are often brightly colored or unusually shaped to attract pollinators. Together, all of the petals of a flower are called corolla. Petals are usually accompanied by another set of special leaves like structures called sepals, that collectively form the calyx and lie just beneath the corolla. The calyx and the corolla together make up the perianth. When the petals and sepals of a flower are difficult to distinguish, they are collectively called tepals. Examples of plants in which the term tepal is appropriate include genera such as Aloe and Tulipa. Conversely, genera such as Rosa and Phaseolus have well-distinguished sepals and petals. When the undifferentiated tepals resemble petals, they are referred to as \\"petaloid\\", as in petaloid monocots, orders of monocots with brightly coloured tepals. Since they include Liliales, an alternative name is lilioid monocots. Although petals are usually the most conspicuous parts of animal-pollinated flowers, wind-pollinated species, such as the grasses, either have very small petals or lack them entirely (apetalous). Corolla alt=Diagram of apopetalous corolla Tubular-campanulate corolla, bearing long points and emergent from tubular calyx ( Brugmansia aurea, Golden Angel's Trumpet, family Solanaceae ). The role of the corolla in plant evolution has been studied extensively since Charles Darwin postulated a theory of the origin of elongated corollae and corolla tubes. A corolla of separate petals, without fusion of individual segments, is apopetalous. If the petals are free from one another in the corolla, the plant is polypetalous or choripetalous; while if the petals are at least partially fused together, it is gamopetalous or sympetalous. In the case of fused tepals, the term is syntepalous. The corolla in some plants forms a tube.  Variations  Pelargonium peltatum , the Ivy-leaved Pelargonium : its floral structure is almost identical to that of geraniums, but it is conspicuously zygomorphic Geranium incanum, with an actinomorphic flower typical of the genus The white flower of Pisum sativum , the Garden Pea : an example of a zygomorphic flower. Narcissus pseudonarcissus, the Wild Daffodil, showing ( from bend to tip of flower ) spathe, floral cup, tepals, corona Petals can differ dramatically in different species. The number of petals in a flower may hold clues to a plant's classification. For example, flowers on eudicots (the largest group of dicots) most frequently have four or five petals while flowers on monocots have three or six petals, although there are many exceptions to this rule. The petal whorl or corolla may be either radially or bilaterally symmetrical (see Symmetry in biology and Floral symmetry). If all of the petals are essentially identical in size and shape, the flower is said to be regular or actinomorphic (meaning \\"ray-formed\\"). Many flowers are symmetrical in only one plane (i.e., symmetry is bilateral) and are termed irregular or zygomorphic (meaning \\"yoke-\\" or \\"pair-formed\\"). In irregular flowers, other floral parts may be modified from the regular form, but the petals show the greatest deviation from radial symmetry. Examples of zygomorphic flowers may be seen in orchids and members of the pea family. In many plants of the aster family such as the sunflower, Helianthus annuus, the circumference of the flower head is composed of ray florets. Each ray floret is anatomically an individual flower with a single large petal. Florets in the centre of the disc typically have no or very reduced petals. In some plants such as Narcissus the lower part of the petals or tepals are fused to form a floral cup (hypanthium) above the ovary, and from which the petals proper extend. Petal often consists of two parts: the upper, broad part, similar to leaf blade, also called the blade and the lower part, narrow, similar to leaf petiole, called the claw, separated from each other at the limb. Claws are developed in petals of some flowers of the family Brassicaceae, such as Erysimum cheiri. The inception and further development of petals shows a great variety of patterns.Sattler, R. 1973. Organogenesis of Flowers. A Photographic Text-Atlas. University of Toronto Press. Petals of different species of plants vary greatly in colour or colour pattern, both in visible light and in ultraviolet. Such patterns often function as guides to pollinators, and are variously known as nectar guides, pollen guides, and floral guides. Genetics The genetics behind the formation of petals, in accordance with the ABC model of flower development, are that sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels are modified versions of each other. It appears that the mechanisms to form petals evolved very few times (perhaps only once), rather than evolving repeatedly from stamens. Significance of pollination Pollination is an important step in the sexual reproduction of higher plants. Pollen is produced by the male flower or by the male organs of hermaphroditic flowers. Pollen does not move on its own and thus requires wind or animal pollinators to disperse the pollen to the stigma (botany) of the same or nearby flowers. However, pollinators are rather selective in determining the flowers they choose to pollinate. This develops competition between flowers and as a result flowers must provide incentives to appeal to pollinators (unless the flower self-pollinates or is involved in wind pollination). Petals play a major role in competing to attract pollinators. Henceforth pollination dispersal could occur and the survival of many species of flowers could prolong. Functions and purposes Petals have various functions and purposes depending on the type of plant. In general, petals operate to protect some parts of the flower and attract/repel specific pollinators. =Function= This is where the positioning of the flower petals are located on the flower is the corolla e.g. the buttercup having shiny yellow flower petals which contain guidelines amongst the petals in aiding the pollinator towards the nectar. Pollinators have the ability to determine specific flowers they wish to pollinate.Cares-Suarez, R, Poch, T, Acevedo, R.F, Acosta-Bravo, I, Pimentel, C, Espinoza, C, Cares, R.A, Munoz, P, Gonzalez, A.V, Botto-Mahan, C (2011) Do pollinators respond in a dose- dependent manner to flower herbivory?: An experimental assessment in Loasa tricolor (Loasaceae). Gayana Botanica, Volume 68, Pages 176-181 Using incentives flowers draw pollinators and set up a mutual relation between each other in which case the pollinators will remember to always guard and pollinate these flowers (unless incentives are not consistently met and competition prevails). =Scent= The petals could produce different scents to allure desirable pollinators or repel undesirable pollinators. Some flowers will also mimic the scents produced by materials such as decaying meat, to attract pollinators to them. =Colour= Various colour traits are used by different petals that could attract pollinators that have poor smelling abilities, or that only come out at certain parts of the day. Some flowers are able to change the colour of their petals as a signal to mutual pollinators to approach or keep away.Science Learning Hub. (2012). The University of Waikato. \\"Attracting pollinators\\". Date Retrieved: August 2013. =Shape and size= Furthermore, the shape and size of the flower/petals is important in selecting the type of pollinators they need. For example, large petals and flowers will attract pollinators at a large distance or that are large themselves. Collectively the scent, colour and shape of petals all play a role in attracting/repelling specific pollinators and providing suitable conditions for pollinating. Some pollinators include insects, birds, bats and the wind. In some petals, a distinction can be made between a lower narrowed, stalk-like basal part referred to as the claw, and a wider distal part referred to as the blade (or limb). Often the claw and blade are at an angle with one another. Types of pollination=Wind pollination= Wind-pollinated flowers often have small, dull petals and produce little or no scent. Some of these flowers will often have no petals at all. Flowers that depend on wind pollination will produce large amounts of pollen because most of the pollen scattered by the wind tends to not reach other flowers. =Attracting insects= Flowers have various regulatory mechanisms in order to attract insects. One such helpful mechanism is the use of colour guiding marks. Insects such as the bee or butterfly can see the ultraviolet marks which are contained on these flowers, acting as an attractive mechanism which is not visible towards the human eye. Many flowers contain a variety of shapes acting to aid with the landing of the visiting insect and also influence the insect to brush against anthers and stigmas (parts of the flower). One such example of a flower is the pohutukawa (Metrosideros excelsa) which acts to regulate colour within a different way. The pohutukawa contains small petals also having bright large red clusters of stamens. Another attractive mechanism for flowers is the use of scents which are highly attractive to humans. One such example is the rose. On the other hand, some flowers produce the smell of rotting meat and are attractive to insects such as flies. Darkness is another factor which flowers have adapted to as nighttime conditions limit vision and color-perception. Fragrancy can be especially useful for flowers which are pollinated at night by moths and other flying insects. =Attracting birds= Flowers are also pollinated by birds and must be large and colorful to be visible against natural scenery. In New Zealand, such bird‚Äìpollinated native plants include: kowhai (Sophora species), flax (Phormium tenax) and kaka beak (Clianthus puniceus). Flowers adapt the mechanism on their petals to change colour in acting as a communicative mechanism for the bird to visit. An example is the tree fuchsia (Fuchsia excorticata) which are green when needing to be pollinated and turn red for the birds to stop coming and pollinating the flower. =Bat-pollinated flowers= Flowers can be pollinated by short tailed bats. An example of this is the dactylanthus (Dactylanthus taylorii). This plant has its home under the ground acting the role of a parasite on the roots of forest trees. The dactylanthus has only its flowers pointing to the surface and the flowers lack colour but have the advantage of containing much nectar and a strong scent. These act as a useful mechanism in attracting the bat.Physics.org (2012). University of Adelaide. \\"Flightless parrots, burrowing bats helped parasitic Hades flower\\". Date Retrieved August 2013.

Born in Britain, and mostly educated there, he spent his career in the United States. He believed that the brain is the \\"most incredible thing in the universe\\". He became widely known for writing best-selling case histories about both his patients' and his own disorders and unusual experiences, with some of his books adapted for plays by major playwrights, feature films, animated short films, opera, dance, fine art, and musical works in the classical genre. After Sacks received his medical degree from The Queen's College, Oxford in 1960, he interned at Middlesex Hospital (now part of University College, London) before moving to the US. He then interned at Mount Zion Hospital in San Francisco and completed his residency in neurology and neuropathology at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He relocated to New York in 1965, where he first worked under a paid fellowship in neurochemistry and neuropathology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Upon realising that the neuro-research career he envisioned for himself would be a poor fit, in 1966 he began serving as neurologist at Beth Abraham Hospital's chronic-care facility in the Bronx. While there, he worked with a group of survivors of the 1920s sleeping sickness encephalitis lethargica, who had been unable to move on their own for decades. His treatment of those patients became the basis of his book Awakenings (1973). In the period from 1966 to 1991 he was a neurological consultant to various New York City-area nursing homes (especially those operated by Little Sisters of the Poor), hospitals, and at the Bronx Psychiatric Center. Sacks was the author of numerous best-selling books, mostly collections of case studies of people, including himself, with neurological disorders. He also published hundreds of articles (both peer- reviewed scientific articles as well as articles for a general audience), not only articles about neurological disorders, but also insightful book reviews and articles about the history of science, natural history, and nature. His writings have been featured in a wide range of media; The New York Times called him a \\"poet laureate of contemporary medicine\\", and \\"one of the great clinical writers of the 20th century\\".In the Region of Lost Minds. New York Times archive , retrieved 18 September 2015. His books include a wealth of narrative detail about his experiences with his patients and his own experiences, and how patients and he coped with their conditions, often illuminating how the normal brain deals with perception, memory, and individuality. In addition to the information content, the beauty of his writing style is especially treasured by many of his readers. Awakenings was adapted into an Academy Award-nominated film in 1990, starring Robin Williams and Robert De Niro. He and his book Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain were the subject of \\"Musical Minds\\", an episode of the PBS series Nova. Sacks was awarded a CBE for services to medicine in the 2008 Birthday Honours.\\"Oliver Sacks dies in New York aged 82\\" . BBC. Retrieved 30 August 2015 Early life Sacks was born in Cricklewood, London, England, the youngest of four children born to Jewish parents: Samuel Sacks, a Lithuanian Jewish doctor (died June 1990),An Anthropologist on Mars (Knopf, 1995), p. 70 and Muriel Elsie Landau, one of the first female surgeons in England (died 1972), who was one of 18 siblings. Sacks had an extremely large extended family of eminent scientists, physicians and other notable individuals, including the director and writer Jonathan Lynn and first cousins, the Israeli statesman Abba Eban and the Nobel Laureate Robert Aumann. In December 1939 when Sacks was six years old, he and his older brother Michael were evacuated from London to escape the Blitz, and sent to a boarding school in the Midlands where he remained until 1943. Unknown to his family, at the school, he and his brother Michael \\"... subsisted on meager rations of turnips and beetroot and suffered cruel punishments at the hands of a sadistic headmaster\\".Nadine Epstein, (2008), Uncle Xenon: The Element of Oliver Sacks Moment Magazine This is detailed in his first autobiography, Uncle Tungsten: Memories of a Chemical Boyhood. Beginning with his return home at the age of 10 from the cruel and devastating boarding school experience, under his Uncle Dave's tutelage he became an intensely focused amateur chemist, as recalled in Uncle Tungsten. Later, he attended St Paul's School in London, where he developed critically important lifelong friendships with Jonathan Miller and Eric Korn. During adolescence he shared an intense interest in biology with these friends, and later came to share his parents' enthusiasm for medicine. He entered The Queen's College, Oxford in 1951, obtaining a BA degree in physiology and biology in 1956. Although not required, Sacks chose to stay on for an additional year to undertake research, after he had taken a course by Hugh Macdonald Sinclair. Sacks recalls, \\"I had been seduced by a series of vivid lectures on the history of medicine and nutrition, given by Sinclair.\\" Sacks adds, \\"And now, in Sinclair's lectures, it was the history of physiology, the ideas and personalities of physiologists, which came to life.\\" Sacks then became involved with the school's Laboratory of Human Nutrition under Sinclair. Sacks focused his research on Jamaica ginger, a toxic and commonly abused drug known to cause irreversible nerve damage. After devoting months to research, he was disappointed by the lack of help and guidance he received from Sinclair. Sacks wrote up an account of his research findings but stopped working on the subject. As a result he became depressed: \\"I felt myself sinking into a state of quiet but in some ways agitated despair.\\" His tutor at Queen's and his parents, seeing his lowered emotional state, suggested he extricate himself from academic studies for a period. His parents then suggested he spend the summer of 1955 living on Israeli kibbutz Ein HaShofet, where the physical labour would help him. Sacks would later describe his experience on the kibbutz as an \\"anodyne to the lonely, torturing months in Sinclair's lab\\". He said he lost from his previously overweight body, as a result of the healthy, hard physical labour he performed there. He spent time travelling around the country, with time spent scuba diving at the Red Sea port city of Eilat, and began to reconsider his future: \\"I wondered again, as I had wondered when I first went to Oxford, whether I really wanted to become a doctor. I had become very interested in neurophysiology, but I also loved marine biology; . . . But I was 'cured' now; it was time to return to medicine, to start clinical work, seeing patients in London.\\" =Medical school= Sacks began medical school at Oxford University in 1956 and for the next two and a half years, he took courses in medicine, surgery, orthopaedics, paediatrics, neurology, psychiatry, dermatology, infectious diseases, obstetrics, and various other disciplines. During his years as a student, he helped home-deliver a number of babies. He received an MA degree and BM BCh degree in 1958. He qualified for his internship that December, which would begin at Middlesex Hospital the following month. \\"My eldest brother, Marcus, had trained at the Middlesex,\\" he said, \\"and now I was following his footsteps.\\" Before beginning his internship, he said he first wanted some actual hospital experience to gain more confidence and he took a job at a hospital in St Albans, where his mother had worked as an emergency surgeon during the war. He then did his six-month internship at Middlesex Hospital's medical unit, followed by another six months in its neurological unit. He completed his internship in June 1960, but was uncertain about his future. Sacks left Britain and flew to Montreal, Canada on 9 July 1960, his 27th birthday. He visited the Montreal Neurological Institute and the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), telling them that he wanted to be a pilot. After some interviews and checking his background, they told him he would be best in medical research. But as he kept making mistakes, like losing data of several months of research, destroying irreplaceable slides and losing biological samples, his supervisors had second thoughts about him.Oliver Sacks chronicles the hilarious errors of his professional life and the fumbles in his private life Dr. Taylor, the head medical officer, told him, \\"You are clearly talented and we would love to have you, but I am not sure about your motives for joining.\\" He was told to travel for a few months and reconsider. He used the next three months to travel across Canada and deep into the Canadian Rockies, which he described in his personal journal, later published as Canada: Pause, 1960. He then made his way to the United States, completing a residency in Neurology at Mt. Zion Hospital in San Francisco, and fellowships in Neurology and Psychiatry at UCLA. While there, Sacks became a lifelong close friend of poet Thom Gunn, saying he loved his wild imagination, his strict control, and perfect poetic form. During much of his time at UCLA, he lived in a rented house in Topanga Canyon and experimented with various recreational drugs. He described some of his experiences in a 2012 New Yorker article, and in his book Hallucinations.Sacks, O. Hallucinations. Knopf (2012). During his early career in California and New York City he indulged in: > staggering bouts of pharmacological experimentation, underwent a fierce > regimen of bodybuilding at Muscle Beach (for a time he held a California > record, after he performed a full squat with 600 pounds across his > shoulders), and racked up more than 100,000 leather-clad miles on his > motorcycle. And then one day he gave it all up‚Äîthe drugs, the sex, the > motorcycles, the bodybuilding. He wrote that after moving to New York City, an amphetamine-facilitated epiphany that came as he read a book by the 19th century migraine doctor Edward Liveing inspired him to chronicle his observations on neurological diseases and oddities; to become the \\"Liveing of our Time\\". Career Sacks served as an instructor and later clinical professor of neurology at Yeshiva University's Albert Einstein College of Medicine from 1966 to 2007, and also held an appointment at the New York University School of Medicine from 1992 to 2007. In July 2007, he joined the faculty of Columbia University Medical Center as a professor of neurology and psychiatry. At the same time, he was appointed Columbia University's first \\"Columbia University Artist\\" at the university's Morningside Heights campus, recognising the role of his work in bridging the arts and sciences. He was also a visiting professor at the University of Warwick in the UK.\\"NYU Langone Medical Center Welcomes Neurologist and Author Oliver Sacks, MD\\" . Newswise.com. 13 September 2012. He returned to New York University School of Medicine in 2012, serving as a professor of neurology and consulting neurologist in the school's epilepsy centre. Sacks's work at Beth Abraham Hospital helped provide the foundation on which the Institute for Music and Neurologic Function (IMNF) is built; Sacks was an honorary medical advisor. The Institute honoured Sacks in 2000 with its first Music Has Power Award. The IMNF again bestowed a Music Has Power Award on him in 2006 to commemorate \\"his 40 years at Beth Abraham and honour his outstanding contributions in support of music therapy and the effect of music on the human brain and mind\\". Sacks maintained a busy hospital-based practice in New York City. He accepted a very limited number of private patients, in spite of being in great demand for such consultations. He served on the boards of the Neurosciences Institute and the New York Botanical GardenSacks, O. Oliver Sacks Curriculum Vitae. Retrieved 7 January 2017 from http://www.oliversacks.com/os/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Oliver-Sacks- cv-2014.pdf where he had been an extremely frequent visitor since he first moved to New York City, as well as a very active member of The Fern Society, which meets there. =Writing= In 1967, Sacks first began to write of his experiences with some of his neurological patients. His first such book, Ward 23, was burned by Sacks during an episode of self-doubt. His books have been translated into over 25 languages. In addition, Sacks was a regular contributor to The New Yorker, the New York Review of Books, The New York Times, London Review of Books and numerous other medical, scientific and general publications. He was awarded the Lewis Thomas Prize for Writing about Science in 2001. Sacks's work is featured in a \\"broader range of media than those of any other contemporary medical author\\" and in 1990, the New York Times wrote he \\"has become a kind of poet laureate of contemporary medicine\\". Sacks considered his literary style to have grown out of the tradition of 19th century \\"clinical anecdotes\\", a literary style that included detailed narrative case histories, which he termed novelistic. He also counted among his inspirations the case histories of the Russian neuropsychologist A. R. Luria, who became a close friend through correspondence between 1973 and 1977, when Dr. Luria died.Sacks, O. (2014). Luria and \\"Romantic Science\\". In A. Yasnitsky, R. Van der Veer & M. Ferrari (Eds.), The Cambridge Handbook of cultural-historical psychology (517‚Äì528). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press After the publication of his first book Migraine in 1970, a review by his close friend W. H. Auden encouraged Sacks to adapt his writing style to \\"be metaphorical, be mythical, be whatever you need\\". Sacks described his cases with a wealth of narrative detail, concentrating on the experiences of the patient (in the case of his A Leg to Stand On, the patient was himself). The patients he described were often able to adapt to their situation in different ways despite the fact that their neurological conditions were usually considered incurable. His book Awakenings, upon which the 1990 feature film of the same name is based, describes his experiences using the new drug levodopa on post-encephalitic patients at the former Beth Abraham Hospital, currently Beth Abraham Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing, Allerton Ave, in The Northeast Bronx, NY. Awakenings was also the subject of the first documentary made (in 1974) for the British television series Discovery. Tobias Picker composed a ballet inspired by Awakenings for the Rambert Dance Company, which was premiered by Rambert in Salford, UK in 2010; Picker, commissioned by The Opera Theatre of Saint Louis, also made an opera of Awakenings with a libretto by Aryeh Lev Stollman. In his book A Leg to Stand On he wrote about the consequences of a near-fatal accident he had at age 41 in 1974, a year after the publication of Awakenings, when he fell off a cliff and severely injured his left leg while mountaineering alone above Hardangerfjord, Norway. In some of his other books, he describes cases of Tourette syndrome and various effects of Parkinson's disease. The title article of The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat describes a man with visual agnosia and was the subject of a 1986 opera by Michael Nyman. The title article of his book, An Anthropologist on Mars, which won a Polk Award for magazine reporting, is about Temple Grandin, an autistic professor. He writes in the book's preface that neurological conditions such as autism \\"can play a paradoxical role, by bringing out latent powers, developments, evolutions, forms of life that might never be seen, or even be imaginable, in their absence\\". Seeing Voices, Sacks's 1989 book, covers a variety of topics in deaf studies. In his book The Island of the Colorblind Sacks wrote about an island where many people have achromatopsia (total colourblindness, very low visual acuity and high photophobia). The second section of this book, entitled Cycad Island, describes the Chamorro people of Guam, who have a high incidence of a neurodegenerative disease locally known as Lytico-Bodig disease (a devastating combination of ALS, dementia and parkinsonism). Later, along with Paul Alan Cox, Sacks published papers suggesting a possible environmental cause for the disease, namely the toxin beta-methylamino L-alanine (BMAA) from the cycad nut accumulating by biomagnification in the flying fox bat. In November 2012 Sacks's book Hallucinations was published. In it he examined why ordinary people can sometimes experience hallucinations and challenges the stigma associated with the word. He explained: \\"Hallucinations don't belong wholly to the insane. Much more commonly, they are linked to sensory deprivation, intoxication, illness or injury.\\" He also considers the less well known Charles Bonnet syndrome, sometimes found in people who have lost their eyesight. The book was described by Entertainment Weekly as: \\"Elegant... An absorbing plunge into a mystery of the mind.\\" Sacks sometimes faced criticism in the medical and disability studies communities. Arthur K. Shapiro for instance, an expert on Tourette syndrome, said Sacks's work was \\"idiosyncratic\\" and relied too much on anecdotal evidence in his writings.Kushner (2000), p. 204 Researcher Makoto Yamaguchi thought Sacks's mathematical explanations, in his study of the numerically gifted savant twins (in The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat), are irrelevant. Alt URL Although Sacks has been characterised as a \\"compassionate\\" writer and doctor, others have felt that he exploited his subjects. Sacks was called \\"the man who mistook his patients for a literary career\\" by British academic and disability rights activist Tom Shakespeare, and one critic called his work \\"a high-brow freak show\\". Sacks responded, \\"I would hope that a reading of what I write shows respect and appreciation, not any wish to expose or exhibit for the thrill ... but it's a delicate business.\\" He is also the author of The Mind's Eye, Oaxaca Journal, On the Move (his second autobiography), and many articles in The New Yorker and The New York Review of Books. Before his death in 2015, Sacks founded the Oliver Sacks Foundation, a nonprofit organization established to increase understanding of the brain through using narrative nonfiction and case histories, with goals that include publishing some of Sacks's unpublished writings, and making his vast amount of unpublished writings available for scholarly study.A Life Well Lived 30 August 2015 His first posthumous book, \\"River of Consciousness\\", an anthology of his essays, was published in October 2017. Most of the essays in \\"River of Consciousness\\" he had previously published in various periodicals or in science-essay- anthology books where he was one of many authors, and are no longer readily obtainable. Sacks specified the order of his essays in \\"River of Consciousness\\" prior to his death. Some of the essays focus on repressed memories and other tricks the mind plays on itself. His next posthumous book will be a collection of some of his letters. Sacks was a prolific handwritten- letter correspondent, and he never communicated by e-mail. Honours In 1996, Sacks became a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters (Literature). He was named a Fellow of the New York Academy of Sciences in 1999. Also in 1999, he became an Honorary Fellow at the Queen's College, Oxford. In 2000, Sacks received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 2002 he became Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (Class IV‚ÄîHumanities and Arts, Section 4‚ÄîLiterature) and he was awarded the 2001 Lewis Thomas Prize by Rockefeller University. Sacks was also a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians (FRCP).Curriculum Vitae - website of Oliver Sacks Sacks was awarded honorary doctorates from Georgetown University (1990), College of Staten Island (1991), Tufts University (1991), New York Medical College (1991), Medical College of Pennsylvania (1992), Bard College (1992), Queen's University at Kingston (2001), Gallaudet University (2005), University of Oxford (2005), Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica del Per√∫ (2006) and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (2008). Oxford University awarded him an honorary Doctor of Civil Law degree in June 2005. Sacks received the position \\"Columbia Artist\\" from Columbia University in 2007, a post that was created specifically for him and that gave him unconstrained access to the university, regardless of department or discipline.Oliver Sacks @ Columbia University Arts Initiative @ Columbia University. 2009. Retrieved 10 October 2011 In 2008 Sacks was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE), for services to medicine, in the Queen's Birthday Honours. The minor planet 84928 Oliversacks, discovered in 2003, was named in his honour. In February 2010, Sacks was named as one of the Freedom From Religion Foundation's Honorary Board of distinguished achievers. He described himself as \\"an old Jewish atheist\\", a phrase borrowed from his friend Jonathan Miller. Personal life Sacks never married and lived alone for most of his life. He declined to share personal details until late in his life. He addressed his homosexuality for the first time in his 2015 autobiography On the Move: A Life.Sacks, O. On the Move: A Life. Knopf (2015). Celibate for about 35 years since his forties, in 2008 he began a friendship with writer and New York Times contributor Bill Hayes. Their friendship slowly evolved into a committed long-term partnership that lasted until Sacks's death; Hayes wrote about it in the 2017 memoir Insomniac City: New York, Oliver, and Me. In Lawrence Weschler's biography And How Are You, Dr. Sacks?, he is described by a colleague as \\"deeply eccentric\\". A friend from his days as a medical resident mentions Sacks' need to cross taboos, like drinking blood mixed with milk, and how he was deeply into drugs like LSD and speed in the early 60s. Sacks himself shared personal information about how he got his first orgasm spontaneously while floating in a swimming pool, and later when he was giving a man a massage. He also admits having \\"erotic fantasies of all sorts\\" in a natural history museum he visited often in his youth, many of them about animals, like hippos in the mud.A Biography of Oliver Sacks, Written by His Boswell Sacks noted in a 2001 interview that severe shyness, which he described as \\"a disease\\", had been a lifelong impediment to his personal interactions. He believed his shyness stemmed from his prosopagnosia, popularly known as \\"face blindness\\", a condition that he studied in some of his patients, including the titular man from his work The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat. This neurological disability of his, whose severity and life- impacts Sacks did not fully grasp until he reached middle age, even prevented him from recognising his own reflection in mirrors.Sacks, O. Face Blind (30 August 2010). The New Yorker . Retrieved 18 May 2015. Sacks' eldest brother Marcus also had prosopagnosia. Sacks swam almost daily for most of his life, beginning when his swimming-champion father started him swimming as an infant. He especially became publicly well known for swimming when he lived in the City Island section of the Bronx, as he would routinely swim around the entire island, or swim vast distances away from the island and back. =Illness and death= Sacks underwent radiation therapy in 2006 for a uveal melanoma in his right eye. He discussed his loss of stereoscopic vision caused by the treatment, which eventually resulted in right-eye blindness, in an article and later in his book The Mind's Eye.Sacks, O. The Mind's Eye. Knopf (2010). . In January 2015 metastases from the ocular tumour were discovered in his liver. Sacks announced this development in a February 2015 New York Times op-ed piece and estimated his remaining time in \\"months\\". He expressed his intent to \\"live in the richest, deepest, most productive way I can\\". He added: \\"I want and hope in the time that remains to deepen my friendships, to say farewell to those I love, to write more, to travel if I have the strength, to achieve new levels of understanding and insight.\\" Sacks died from the disease on 30 August 2015 at his home in Manhattan at the age of 82, surrounded by his closest friends.

She is a consultant to the livestock industry on animal behavior, and an autism spokesperson. She is one of the first individuals on the autism spectrum to document the insights she gained from her personal experience of autism. She is currently a faculty member with Animal Sciences in the College of Agricultural Sciences at Colorado State University. In the 2010 Time 100, an annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world, she was named among those in the \\"Heroes\\" category. She was the subject of the Emmy- and Golden Globe-winning semi-biographical film Temple Grandin. Grandin has been an outspoken proponent of the autism rights and neurodiversity movements. Early life=Family= Mary Temple Grandin was born in Boston, Massachusetts, into a very wealthy family. One of the employees of the family also was named Mary, so Grandin was referred to by her middle name, Temple, to avoid confusion. Her mother is Anna Eustacia Purves (now Cutler), an actress, singer, and granddaughter of John Coleman Purves (co-inventor for the autopilot aviation system), with a degree in English from Harvard University. Her father was Richard McCurdy Grandin, a real estate agent and heir to the largest corporate wheat farm business in America at the time, Grandin Farms. Grandin's parents divorced when she was 15, and her mother eventually went on to marry Ben Cutler, a renowned New York saxophonist, in 1965, when Grandin was 18 years old. Her father, Richard Grandin, died in California in 1993. Grandin is the eldest of four children and has three younger siblings: two sisters and a brother. Grandin has described one of her sisters as being dyslexic. Her younger sister is an artist, her other sister is a sculptor, and her brother is a banker. John Livingston Grandin (Temple's paternal great-grandfather) and his brother William James Grandin, were French Huguenots who drilled for oil. He intended to cut a deal with John D. Rockefeller in a meeting, but the latter kept him waiting too long so he walked out before Rockefeller arrived. Then the brothers went into banking and when Jay Cooke's firm collapsed they received thousands of acres of undeveloped land in North Dakota as debt collateral. They set up wheat farming in the Red River Valley and housed the workers in dormitories. The town of Grandin, North Dakota, is named after John Livingston Grandin. Although raised in the Episcopal Church, early on Temple Grandin gave up on a belief in a personal deity or intention in favor of what she considers a more scientific perspective. =Diagnosis= Grandin was never formally diagnosed with autism until her adulthood. As a two year old, the only formal diagnosis given to Grandin was 'brain damage,‚Äô a subsequent finding corroborated through cerebral imaging at the University of Utah by the time she turned 64 in 2010. While Grandin was still in her mid-teens, her mother chanced upon a diagnostic checklist for autism. After reviewing the checklist, Grandin's mother hypothesised that Grandin's symptoms were best explained by the disorder and was later determined to be an autistic savant, but a formal diagnosis consistent with being on the autism spectrum was made only when Grandin was in her forties. =Early childhood= Her mother, Eustacia, took Grandin to the world's leading special needs researchers at the Boston Children's Hospital, with the hope of unearthing an alternative to institutionalization. Grandin's mother eventually located a neurologist who suggested a trial of speech therapy. A speech therapist was hired and Grandin received personalized training from the age of two and a half. A nanny was hired when Grandin was aged three to play educational games for hours with her. Grandin started kindergarten in Dedham Country Day School. Her teachers and class strove to create an environment to accommodate Grandin's needs and sensitivities. Grandin considers herself fortunate to have had supportive mentors from elementary school onward. Even so, Grandin states that junior high and high school were the most unpleasant times of her life. The medical advice at the time for a diagnosis of autism was to recommend institutionalization, a measure that caused a bitter rift of opinion between Grandin's parents. Her father was keen to follow this advice while her mother was strongly opposed to the idea as it likely would have caused her to never be able to see her daughter again. =Middle school and high school= Grandin attended Beaver Country Day School from seventh grade to ninth grade. She was expelled at the age of 14 for throwing a book at a schoolmate who had taunted her. Grandin has described herself as the \\"nerdy kid\\" whom everyone ridiculed. She has described occasions when she walked down the hallways and her fellow students would taunt her by saying \\"tape recorder\\" because of her habit of repetitive speech. Grandin states, \\"I could laugh about it now, but back then it really hurt.\\" The year after her expulsion, Grandin's parents divorced. Three years later, Grandin's mother married Ben Cutler, a New York saxophonist. At 15, Grandin spent a summer on the Arizona ranch of Ben Cutler's sister, Ann, and this would become a formative experience toward her subsequent career interest. Following her expulsion from Beaver Country Day School (reports vary on the name of the school Grandin was expelled from, with Grandin noting it to be Cherry Falls Girls' School in her first book, Emergence: Labelled Autistic), Grandin's mother placed her in Mountain Country School (now known as Hampshire Country School), a private boarding school in Rindge, New Hampshire, for children with behavioral problems. It was here that Grandin met William Carlock, a science teacher who had worked for NASA. He became her mentor and helped significantly toward building up her self- confidence. It was Carlock who encouraged Grandin to develop her idea to build her hug box (referred to as a \\"squeeze machine\\" by Grandin) when she returned from her aunt's farm in Arizona in her senior year of high school. At the age of 18 when she was still attending Mountain Country School, with Carlock's assistance Grandin built the hug box. Carlock's supportive role in Grandin's life continued even after she left Mountain Country School. For example, when Grandin was facing criticism for her hug box at Franklin Pierce College, it was Carlock who suggested that Grandin undertake scientific experiments to evaluate the efficacy of the device. It was his constant guidance to Grandin to refocus the rigid obsessions she experienced with the hug box into a productive assignment, that subsequently, allowed this study undertaken by Grandin to be widely cited as evidence of Grandin's resourcefulness. =Higher education= After she graduated from Mountain Country School in 1966, Grandin went on to earn her bachelor's degree in human psychology from Franklin Pierce College in 1970, a master's degree in animal science from Arizona State University in 1975, and a doctoral degree in animal science from the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign in 1989. Career Grandin is a prominent and widely cited proponent for the humane treatment of livestock for slaughter. She is internationally famous as a spokesperson on autism as well. =Autism spectrum= Steve Silberman in his book, NeuroTribes, wrote that Temple Grandin helped break down years of shame and stigma because she was one of the first adults to publicly disclose that she was autistic. Bernard Rimland, a father of a son with autism and author of the book, Infantile Autism, wrote the foreword to Grandin's first book Emergence: Labeled Autistic. Her book was published in 1986. Dr. Rimland wrote \\"Temple's ability to convey to the reader her innermost feelings and fears, coupled with her capacity for explaining mental processes will give the reader an insight into autism that very few have been able to achieve.\\" In her later book, Thinking in Pictures, published in 1995, the neurologist Oliver Sacks wrote at the end of the foreword that the book provided \\"a bridge between our world and hers, and allows us to glimpse into a quite other sort of mind.\\" In her early writings, Grandin characterized herself as a recovered autistic and, in his foreword, Bernard Rimland used the term recovered autistic individual. In her later writings she has abandoned this characterization. Steve Silberman wrote, \\"It became obvious to her, however, that she was not recovered but had learned with great effort to adapt to the social norms of the people around her.\\" When her book Thinking in Pictures was written in 1995, Grandin thought that all individuals with autism thought in photographic-specific images the way she did. By the time the expanded edition was published in 2006, she had realized that it had been wrong to presume that every person with autism processed information in the same way she did. In the 2006 edition, she wrote that there were three types of specialized thinking. They were: 1. Visual Thinkers like she is, who think in photographically-specific images. 2. Music and Math Thinkers ‚Äì who think in patterns and may be good at mathematics, chess, and programming computers. 3. Verbal Logic Thinkers ‚Äì who think in word details, and she noted that their favorite subject may be history. In one of her later books, The Autistic Brain: Thinking Across the Spectrum, the concept of three different types of thinking by autistic individuals is expanded. This book was published in 2013. An influential book that helped her to develop her concept of pattern thinking was Clara Claiborne Park's book entitled, Exiting Nirvana: A Daughter's Life with Autism. It was published in 2001. The Autistic Brain also contains an extensive review of scientific studies that provide evidence that object-visual thinking is different from spatial-visualization abilities. Grandin became well-known beyond the American autistic community, after being described by Oliver Sacks in the title narrative of his book, An Anthropologist on Mars (1995), for which he won a Polk Award. The title is derived from Grandin's characterization of how she feels around neurotypical people. In the mid-1980s Grandin first spoke in public about autism at the request of Ruth C. Sullivan, one of the founders of the Autism Society of America (ASA). Sullivan writes: Based on personal experience, Grandin advocates early intervention to address autism and supportive teachers, who can direct fixations of the child with autism in fruitful directions. She has described her hypersensitivity to noise and other sensory stimuli. She says words are her second language and that she thinks \\"totally in pictures\\", using her vast visual memory to translate information into a mental slideshow of images that may be manipulated or correlated. Grandin attributes her success as a humane livestock facility designer to her ability to recall detail, which is a characteristic of her visual memory. Grandin compares her memory to full- length movies in her head, that may be replayed at will, allowing her to notice small details. She also is able to view her memories using slightly different contexts by changing the positions of the lighting and shadows. As a proponent of neurodiversity, Grandin does not support eliminating autism genes or treating mildly-autistic individuals. However, she believes that autistic children who are severely handicapped need therapy with applied behavioral analysis. Additionally, she has claimed that she only will attend talks given by autistics who can hold down a career. =Handling livestock= In 1980 Grandin published her first two scientific articles on beef cattle behavior during handling: \\"Livestock Behavior as Related to Handling Facilities Design\\" in the International Journal for the Study of Animal Problems, Vol. 1, pp. 33-52 and \\"Observations of Cattle Behavior Applied to the Design of Cattle Handling Facilities\\", Applied Animal Ethology, Vol. 6, pp. 19-31. She was one of the first scientists to report that animals are sensitive to visual distractions in handling facilities such as shadows, dangling chains, and other environmental details that most people do not notice. When she was awarded her Ph.D. at the University of Illinois, she studied the effects of environmental enrichment on pigs. The title of her dissertation was \\"Effect of Rearing Environment and Environmental Enrichment on the Behavior and Neural Development in Young Pigs\\". Grandin expanded her theories in her book, Animals Make Us Human. In 1993, she edited the first edition of Livestock Handling and Transport. Grandin wrote three chapters and included chapters from contributors from around the world. Subsequent editions of the book were published in 2000, 2007, and 2014. In her academic work as a professor at Colorado State University, her graduate student, Bridgett Voisinet, conducted one of the early studies that demonstrated that cattle who remained calm during handling, had higher weight gains. In 1997, when the paper was published, this was a new concept. The paper is entitled, \\"Feedlot Cattle with Calm Temperaments Have Higher Average Daily Gains Than Cattle with Excitable Temperaments\\", published in The Journal of Animal Science, Vol. 75, pp. 892-896. Another important paper published by Grandin was, \\"Assessment of Stress During Handling and Transport\\", Journal of Animal Science, 1997, Vol. 75, pp. 249-257. This paper presented the concept that an animal's previous experiences with handling could have an effect on how it will react to being handled in the future, as a new concept in the animal-handling industry. A major piece of equipment that Grandin developed was a center track (double rail) conveyor restrainer system for holding cattle during stunning at large beef slaughtering plants. The first system was installed in the mid-1980s for calves and a system for large beef cattle was developed in 1990. This equipment is now being used by many large meat companies. It is described in \\"Double Rail Restrainer Conveyor for Livestock Handling\\", first published in the Journal of Agricultural Engineering Research, Vol. 4, pp. 327-338 in 1988, and \\"Transferring results of behavioral research to industry to improve animal welfare on the farm, ranch, and slaughter plant\\", Applied Animal Behavior Science, Vol. 8, pp. 215-228, published in 2003. Grandin also developed an objective, numerical scoring system for assessing animal welfare at slaughtering plants. The use of this scoring system resulted in significant improvements in animal stunning and handling during slaughter. This work is described in \\"Objective scoring of animal handling and stunning practices in slaughter plants\\", Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, Vol. 212, pp. 36-39, \\"The feasibility of using vocalization scoring as an indicator of poor welfare during slaughter\\", Applied Animal Behavior Science, Vol. 56, pp. 121‚Äì128, and \\"Effect of animal welfare audits of slaughter plants by a major fast food company on cattle handling and stunning practices\\", Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, Vol. 216, pp. 848‚Äì851. In 2008, Grandin published Humane Livestock Handling with contributions by Mark Deesing, a long time collaborator with her. The book contains a review of the main aspects of cattle behavior and provides a visual guide in the form of construction plans and diagrams for the implementation of Grandin's ideas relating to humane livestock handling. =Other scientific contributions= Grandin is the author or co-author of more than 60 peer-reviewed scientific papers on a variety of other animal behavior subjects. Some of the other subjects are: the effect of hair whorl position on cattle behavior, the influence of stress prior to slaughter upon meat quality, religious slaughter, mothering behavior of beef cows, cattle temperament, and causes of bruising. =Animal welfare= Grandin has lectured widely about her first-hand experiences of the anxiety of feeling threatened by everything in her surroundings, and of being dismissed and feared, which motivates her work in humane livestock handling processes. She studied the behavior of cattle, how they react to ranchers, movements, objects, and light. Grandin then designed curved corrals she adapted with the intention of reducing stress, panic, and injury in animals being led to slaughter. This has proved to be a further point of criticism and controversy among animal activists who have questioned the congruence of a career built on animal slaughter alongside Grandin's claims of compassion and respect for animals. While her designs are widely used throughout the slaughterhouse industry, her claim of compassion for the animals is that because of her autism she can see the animals' reality from their viewpoint, that when she holds an animal's head in her hands as it is being slaughtered, she feels a deep connection to them. Her business website promotes improvement of standards for slaughterhouses and livestock farms. The \\"squeeze machine\\" is sold at US$4,525 by Therafin Corporation. In 2004, Grandin won a \\"Proggy\\" award in the \\"Visionary\\" category, from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. One of her notable essays about animal welfare is, \\"Animals Are Not Things\\", in which she posits that technically, animals are property in society, but the law ultimately gives them ethical protections or rights. She compares the properties and rights of owning cattle, versus owning screwdrivers, enumerating how both may be used to serve human purposes in many ways, but when it comes to inflicting pain, there is a vital distinction between such \\"properties\\", because legally, a person can smash or grind up a screwdriver, but cannot torture an animal. Her insight into the minds of cattle has taught her to value the changes in details to which animals are particularly sensitive and to use her visualization skills to design thoughtful and humane animal-handling equipment. She was named a fellow of the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers in 2009. In 2012, when the American beef industry was struggling with public perception of its use and sale of pink slime, Grandin spoke out in support of the food product. She said, \\"It should be on the market. It should be labeled. We should not be throwing away that much beef.\\" Grandin's work has attracted the attention of philosophers interested in the moral status of animals. One view found in the academic literature is that Grandin's method of slaughter is a significant positive development for animals, but her attempts to formulate a moral defense of meat-eating have been less successful.Andy Lamey, \\"The Animal Ethics of Temple Grandin: A Protectionist Analysis,\\" The Journal Of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics, Vol. 32 Issue 1, 2019. Open access version at https://philpapers.org/rec/LAMTAE-2 Personal life TED in February 2010 Grandin says that \\"the part of other people that has emotional relationships is not part of me\\", and she has neither married nor had children. She later stated, for example, that she preferred the science fiction, documentary, and thriller genre of films and television shows to more dramatic or romantic ones. Beyond her work in animal science and welfare and autism rights, her interests include horseback riding, science fiction, movies, and biochemistry. She has noted in her autobiographical works that autism affects every aspect of her life. Grandin has to wear comfortable clothes to counteract her sensory processing disorder and has structured her lifestyle to avoid sensory overload. She regularly takes antidepressants, but no longer uses a squeeze-box (hug machine), the device she invented at the age of 18 as a form of stress relief therapy, stating in February 2010 that: \\"It broke two years ago, and I never got around to fixing it. I'm into hugging people now.\\" Honors In 2010, Grandin was named in the Time 100 list of the one hundred most influential people in the world, in the \\"Heroes\\" category. In 2011, she received a Double Helix Medal. She has received honorary degrees from many universities including McGill University in Canada (1999), and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (2009), Carnegie Mellon University in the United States (2012), and Emory University (2016). In 2015, she was named an honorary fellow of the Society for Technical Communication. In 2011, Grandin was awarded the Ashoka Fellowship. In 2012, Grandin was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame. In 2012, Grandin was inducted into the Texas Trail of Fame. In 2012, she was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum. Grandin received a Meritorious Achievement Award from the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) in 2015. In 2016, Grandin was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2017, Grandin was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame. In popular culture Grandin has been featured on major media programs, such as Lisa Davis' It's Your Health, ABC's Primetime Live, the Today Show, Larry King Live, and Fresh Air with Terry Gross. She has been written up in Time magazine, People magazine, Discover magazine, Forbes, and The New York Times. In 2012, Grandin was interviewed on Thriving Canine Radio to discuss \\"A Different Perspective on Animal Behavior\\". She was the subject of the Horizon documentary \\"The Woman Who Thinks Like a Cow\\", first broadcast by the BBC on June 8, 2006, and Nick News with Linda Ellerbee in the spring of 2006. She also was the subject of the first episode in the series First Person by Errol Morris. Grandin is the focus of a semi-biographical HBO film entitled Temple Grandin, starring Claire Danes as Grandin. The film was broadcast on February 6, 2010. The movie was nominated for 15 Primetime Emmy Awards and won seven awards, including Outstanding Television Movie and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or Movie for Claire Danes. Grandin was on stage as the award was accepted and she spoke briefly to the audience. Coincidentally, the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards happened on Grandin's birthday ‚Äì August 29. On January 16, 2011, at the 68th Golden Globe Awards, Claire Danes won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress ‚Äì Miniseries or Television Film. Grandin was featured in Beautiful Minds: A Voyage Into the Brain, a documentary produced in 2006 by colourfield tell-a-vision, a German company. She was named one of 2010's one hundred most influential people in the world by Time magazine. In 2011, she was featured in an episode of the Science documentary series Ingenious Minds. In 2018, Grandin was featured in the documentary This Business of Autism, which explored autism employment and the success story of autism employers such as Spectrum Designs Foundation and was produced by Mesh Omnimedia. She also was interviewed by Michael Pollan in his best-selling book, The Omnivore's Dilemma, in which she discussed the livestock industry. Folk-punk band AJJ, formerly known as Andrew Jackson Jihad, included two songs called \\"Temple Grandin\\" and \\"Temple Grandin Too\\" on their LP Christmas Island. In 2018, Grandin was profiled in the book Rescuing Ladybugs by author and animal advocate Jennifer Skiff as a \\"global hero\\" for \\"standing her ground and fighting for change after witnessing the extreme mistreatment of animals\\" used in farming.

Often it results in a few bald spots on the scalp, each about the size of a coin. The disease may cause psychological disorder. People are generally otherwise healthy. In a few cases, all the hair on the scalp or all body hair is lost and loss can be permanent. Alopecia areata is believed to be an autoimmune disease resulting from a breach in the immune privilege of the hair follicles. Risk factors include a family history of the condition. Among identical twins, if one is affected, the other has about a 50% chance of also being affected. The underlying mechanism involves failure by the body to recognize its own cells with subsequent immune mediated destruction of the hair follicle. No cure for the condition is known. Efforts may be used to try to speed hair regrowth such as cortisone injections. Sunscreen, head coverings to protect from cold and sun, and glasses if the eyelashes are missing are recommended. In some cases, the hair regrows and the condition does not reoccur. In others, hair loss and regrowth occurs over years. Among those in whom all body hair is lost, less than 10% recover. About 0.15% of people are affected at any one time and 2% of people are affected at some point in time. Onset is usually in childhood. Males and females have the condition in equal numbers. The condition does not affect a person's life expectancy.  Signs and symptoms  Alopecia areata Typical first symptoms of alopecia areata are small bald patches. The underlying skin is unscarred and looks superficially normal. Although these patches can take many shapes, they are usually round or oval. Alopecia areata most often affects the scalp and beard, but may occur on any part of the body with hair. Different areas of the skin may exhibit hair loss and regrowth at the same time. The disease may also go into remission for a time, or may be permanent. It is common in children. The area of hair loss may tingle or be painful.American Osteopathic College of Dermatology. Alopecia Areata. Dermatologic Disease Database. Aocd.org. Retrieved on December 3, 2007. The hair tends to fall out over a short period of time, with the loss commonly occurring more on one side of the scalp than the other. Exclamation point hairs, narrower along the length of the strand closer to the base, producing a characteristic \\"exclamation point\\" appearance, are often present.Zoe Diana Draelos (August 30, 2007), Alopecia Areata . MedicineNet.com. Retrieved on December 2, 2007 These hairs are very short (3‚Äì4 mm), and can be seen surrounding the bald patches. When healthy hair is pulled out, at most a few should come out, and ripped hair should not be distributed evenly across the tugged portion of the scalp. In cases of alopecia areata, hair tends to pull out more easily along the edge of the patch where the follicles are already being attacked by the body's immune system than away from the patch where they are still healthy. Nails may have pitting or trachyonychia.  Causes  In alopecia areata, a hair follicle is attacked by the immune system. T-cells swarm the roots, killing the follicle. This causes the hair to fall out and parts of the head to bald. Alopecia areata is thought to be a systemic autoimmune disorder in which the body attacks its own anagen hair follicles and suppresses or stops hair growth. For example, T cell lymphocytes cluster around affected follicles, causing inflammation and subsequent hair loss. Hair follicles in a normal state are thought to be kept secure from the immune system, a phenomenon called immune privilege. A breach in this immune privilege state is considered as the cause of alopecia areata. A few cases of babies being born with congenital alopecia areata have been reported. Alopecia areata is not contagious. It occurs more frequently in people who have affected family members, suggesting heredity may be a factor. Strong evidence of genetic association with increased risk for alopecia areata was found by studying families with two or more affected members. This study identified at least four regions in the genome that are likely to contain these genes. In addition, alopecia areata shares genetic risk factors with other autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, and celiac disease. It may be the only manifestation of celiac disease. Endogenous retinoids metabolic defect is a key part of the pathogenesis of the alopecia areata. In 2010, a genome-wide association study was completed that identified 129 single nucleotide polymorphisms that were associated with alopecia areata. The genes that were identified include those involved in controlling the activation and proliferation of regulatory T cells, cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4, interleukin-2, interleukin-2 receptor A, and Eos (also known as Ikaros family zinc finger 4), as well as the human leukocyte antigen. The study also identified two genes, PRDX5 and STX17, that are expressed in the hair follicle.  Diagnosis  Alopecia areata is usually diagnosed based on clinical features. Trichoscopy may aid in establishing the diagnosis. In alopecia areata, trichoscopy shows regularly distributed \\"yellow dots\\" (hyperkeratotic plugs), small exclamation-mark hairs, and \\"black dots\\" (destroyed hairs in the hair follicle opening). Oftentimes, however, discrete areas of hair loss surrounded by exclamation mark hairs is sufficient for clinical diagnosis of alopecia areata. Sometimes, reddening of the skin, erythema, may also be present in the balding area. A biopsy is rarely needed to make the diagnosis or aid in the management of alopecia areata. Histologic findings may include peribulbar lymphocytic infiltration resembling a \\"swarm of bees\\", a shift in the anagen-to-telogen ratio towards telogen, and dilated follicular infundibulae. Other helpful findings can include pigment incontinence in the hair bulb and follicular stelae. Occasionally, in inactive alopecia areata, no inflammatory infiltrates are found. = Classification = Commonly, alopecia areata involves hair loss in one or more round spots on the scalp.. * Hair may also be lost more diffusely over the whole scalp, in which case the condition is called diffuse alopecia areata. * Alopecia areata monolocularis describes baldness in only one spot. It may occur anywhere on the head. * Alopecia areata multilocularis refers to multiple areas of hair loss. * Ophiasis refers to hair loss in the shape of a wave at the circumference of the head. * The disease may be limited only to the beard, in which case it is called alopecia areata barbae. * If the person loses all the hair on the scalp, the disease is then called alopecia areata totalis. * If all body hair, including pubic hair, is lost, the diagnosis then becomes alopecia areata universalis. Alopecia areata totalis and universalis are rare.Skin Conditions: Alopecia Areata . WebMD. Retrieved on December 2, 2007.  Treatment  The objective assessment of treatment efficacy is very difficult and spontaneous remission is unpredictable, but if the affected area is patched, the hair may regrow spontaneously in many cases. None of the existing therapeutic options are curative or preventive. In cases of severe hair loss, limited success has been achieved by using the corticosteroid medications clobetasol or fluocinonide, corticosteroid injections, or cream. Application of corticosteroid creams to the affected skin is less effective and takes longer to produce results. Steroid injections are commonly used in sites where the areas of hair loss on the head are small or especially where eyebrow hair has been lost. Whether they are effective is uncertain. Some other medications that have been used are minoxidil, Elocon (mometasone) ointment (steroid cream), irritants (anthralin or topical coal tar), and topical immunotherapy ciclosporin, sometimes in different combinations. Topical corticosteroids frequently fail to enter the skin deeply enough to affect the hair bulbs, which are the treatment target, and small lesions typically also regrow spontaneously. Oral corticosteroids may decrease the hair loss, but only for the period during which they are taken, and these medications can cause serious side effects. No one treatment is effective in all cases, and some individuals may show no response to any treatment. Few treatments have been well evaluated. A 2008 meta-analysis of oral and topical corticosteroids, topical ciclosporin, photodynamic therapy, and topical minoxidil showed no benefit of hair growth compared with placebo, especially with regard to long-term benefits. When alopecia areata is associated with celiac disease, treatment with a gluten-free diet allows for complete and permanent regrowth of scalp and other body hair in many people, but in others, remissions and recurrences are seen. This improvement is probably due to the normalization of the immune response as a result of gluten withdrawal from the diet.  Prognosis  In most cases that begin with a small number of patches of hair loss, hair grows back after a few months to a year. In cases with a greater number of patches, hair can either grow back or progress to alopecia areata totalis or, in rare cases, alopecia areata universalis. No loss of body function occurs, and the effects of alopecia areata are psychological (loss of self-image due to hair loss), although these can be severe. Loss of hair also means the scalp burns more easily in the sun. Patients may also have aberrant nail formation because keratin forms both hair and nails. Hair may grow back and then fall out again later. This may not indicate a recurrence of the condition, but rather a natural cycle of growth-and-shedding from a relatively synchronised start; such a pattern will fade over time. Episodes of alopecia areata before puberty predispose to chronic recurrence of the condition. Alopecia can be the cause of psychological stress. Because hair loss can lead to significant changes in appearance, individuals with it may experience social phobia, anxiety, and depression.  Epidemiology  The condition affects 0.1%‚Äì0.2% of the population, and occurs equally in both males and females. Alopecia areata occurs in people who are otherwise healthy and have no other skin disorders. Initial presentation most commonly occurs in the early childhood, late teenage years, or young adulthood, but can happen at any ages. Patients also tend to have a slightly higher incidence of conditions related to the immune system, such as asthma, allergies, atopic dermatitis, and hypothyroidism.  Research  Many medications are being studied. Some of these medications are approved for other diseases, others are not available outside of studies. In 2014, preliminary findings showing that oral ruxolitinib, a drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for bone marrow disorder myelofibrosis, restored hair growth in three individuals with long-standing and severe disease. The medicine costs almost US$10,000 a month.  History  Alopecia areata and alopecia barbae have been identified by some as the biblical condition that is part of the greater family of skin disorders; the said disorders are purported to being discussed in the Book of Leviticus, chapter 13.

Mesrine repeatedly escaped from prison and made international headlines during a final period as a fugitive when his exploits included trying to kidnap the judge who had previously sentenced him. An aptitude for disguise earned him the moniker \\"The Man of a Thousand Faces\\" and enabled him to remain at large while receiving massive publicity as a wanted man. Mesrine was widely seen as an anti-establishment 'Robin Hood' figure. In keeping with his charismatic image, he was rarely without a glamorous female companion. A two-part film which came out in 2008 was based on Mesrine's life. Early life and criminal career up to 1965 Jacques Ren√© Mesrine was born in Clichy, near Paris on 28 December 1936 to a couple of blue-collar origin who had moved up in social class. As a child, he witnessed a massacre of villagers by German soldiers. His parents had great aspirations for their son and sent him to the prestigious Catholic Coll√®ge de Juilly where his friends included the likes of musician and composer Jean-Jacques Debout. Mesrine was an extremely unruly pupil and he was expelled from Juilly for attacking the principal. He went on to be expelled from other schools and fell into the lifestyle of a juvenile delinquent, much to the dismay of his family. In 1955, at age 19, he married Lydia De Souza in Clichy; the couple divorced a year later. Drafted into the French Army, he volunteered for special duty in the Algerian War as a parachutist/commando. While participating in counter- insurgency operations, Mesrine's duties are said to have included the killing of prisoners. Although he disliked military discipline, Mesrine enjoyed action and was decorated with the Cross for Military Valour by General Charles de Gaulle before leaving the army in 1959. His father was later to claim that the time in Algeria had brought about a noticeable deterioration in Mesrine's behavior.Line of Fire: Heroism, Tragedy, and Canada's Police By Edward ButtsMesrine, Penguin Books, 1980.(English) In 1961, Mesrine became involved with the Organisation arm√©e secr√®te. He married Maria De La Soledad; they had three children but later separated in 1965. In 1962, Mesrine was sentenced to 18 months in prison for robbery (his first prison sentence, although he had been a professional criminal for a number of years). After being released, Mesrine made an effort to reform: he worked at an architectural design company where he constructed models, showing considerable ability. However, a downsizing in 1964 resulted in him being laid off. His family bought him the tenancy of a country restaurant, a role in which he was quite successful, but this arrangement ended after the owner paid a visit one evening to find Mesrine carousing with acquaintances from his past. The lure of easy money and women proved impossible for him to resist and he returned to crime. Overcoming some suspicion about his relatively middle-class background, Mesrine began to establish a reputation in the underworld as a man who was crossed at one's peril.Line of Fire: Heroism, Tragedy, and Canada's Police, Edward Butts 2009 In December 1965, Mesrine was arrested in the villa of the military governor in Palma de Mallorca. He was sentenced to six months in jail and later claimed that Spanish authorities believed he was working for French intelligence. Canary Islands, Canada, Venezuela, 1966‚Äì1972 In 1966, Mesrine opened a restaurant in the Canary Islands. In December of the same year, he robbed a jewellery store in Geneva and a hotel in Chamonix. The following year, Mesrine robbed a fashion store in Paris. In February 1968, he fled to Quebec with his then mistress, Jeanne Schneider, and worked as a cook and chauffeur for grocery and textile millionaire Georges Deslauriers for a few months. An argument Schneider had with Deslauriers' long-time respected gardener led to both being dismissed. They then attempted to kidnap Deslauriers, but this scheme failed when a supposedly strong sedative had no effect on Deslauriers. On June 26, 1969, Mesrine and Schneider fled to the US. On June 30, Evelyne Le Bouthillier, an elderly lady who may have given them refuge, was found strangled. A couple of weeks later, on July 16, Mesrine and Schneider were arrested in Arkansas on information supplied by an accomplice and extradited to Quebec.Line of Fire: Heroism, Tragedy, and Canada's Police, (2009), Edward Butts (2009) Mesrine was sentenced to 10 years in prison for the bungled kidnapping; he escaped a few weeks later, but was rearrested the next day. Mesrine and Schneider were acquitted of the murder of Le Bouthillier in 1971. With Jean-Paul Mercier, Mesrine cut through the wire to escape again on August 21, 1972, with five others from the Saint-Vincent-de-Paul prison. Mercier, a wanted murderer, and Mesrine then robbed a series of banks in Montreal, sometimes two in the same day. By this time it was apparent that Mesrine did not have a normal criminal attitude towards minimizing the danger of being caught. Deeply resenting the way he had been treated in the prison, Mesrine and Mercier made an extremely risky attempt to precipitate a mass break out from the maximum security block of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul on September 3, 1972. However, their own break-out had caused perimeter security to be greatly increased and they found the area swarming with armed guards. There was a shoot-out in which two guards were seriously injured and Mercier was wounded before they managed to get away. The boldness of escaped convicts returning to attack a prison infuriated Canadian law enforcement; the escapade predictably led to a hugely increased effort to arrest the duo. =Murder of M√©d√©ric Cote and Ernest Saint-Pierre= A week after their foiled attempt to free the prisoners, Mesrine and Mercier went for a target practice session, taking Mercier's girlfriend along. But the location, though three miles down a dirt track through the forest, was far from being truly remote and the noise of them blasting away at targets all afternoon could be heard in the town of Plessisville where there was a Ministry of Natural Resources and Wildlife station. When Mesrine and company drove back along the track, two forest rangers, M√©d√©ric Cote, aged 62, and Ernest Saint-Pierre, aged 50, were waiting. The rangers were armed but their jobs had mainly involved enforcing hunting and firearms regulations, and in any case, there was no reason for them to expect that the men who had been making themselves conspicuous by such a disturbance would actually be wanted escapees. Realizing they were not policemen, Mesrine submitted to a search of the car, but on finding loaded guns in the rear, the rangers informed them that they would have to follow their car back to Plessisville. While Mesrine was trying to talk them out of this, Cote, possibly alerted by the sight of the arsenal of weapons, suddenly recognised the pair, whereupon Mesrine and Mercier shot both officers dead. Mesrine continued robbing banks in Montreal, and even covertly gained access into the US again for a brief stay at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City, before moving to Caracas, Venezuela. Return to France: 1972‚Äì1977 By the end of 1972, Mesrine had returned to France, where he resumed robbing banks. On March 5, 1973, during an argument with a cashier in a coffee bar, Mesrine brandished a revolver and seriously injured a police officer who tried to intervene. He was arrested 3 days later. In May, he was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment ‚Äì which, considering his record, was lenient for the time and place ‚Äì to be served at La Sant√© maximum security prison where escape was thought to be impossible. In a plan likely formulated even before his arrest, Mesrine took a judge sentencing him on another matter hostage with a revolver (recovered from the courthouse lavatory where it had been hidden by an accomplice) and escaped. After being at large for four months, he was arrested in his new Paris apartment on September 28, 1973, on information supplied by an associate who wanted a reduced sentence. Mesrine was returned to La Sant√© where he covertly wrote and smuggled out an autobiography, titled L'Instinct de Mort (\\"Death Instinct\\"),L'Instinct de Mort, Editions Lattes, 1977(French)(First publishing)L'instinct de Mort, Flammarion Quebec, 2008.(French) in which he claimed to have committed upwards of forty murders, a number thought by some to be a considerable exaggeration. The appearance of Mesrine's book resulted in France passing a \\"Son of Sam law\\", designed to stop criminals profiting from the publication of their crimes. Escape from La Sant√© La Sant√© was seen as escape proof. In his escapes from his Canadian prisons, Mesrine had required little more than wire cutters and a very high degree of audacity. During this incarceration, however, he faced security far better than any he had defeated before. A report noted that Mesrine had been seen doing exercises in his cell and was behaving like a man who had received good news. On May 8, 1978, he produced a gun, stole keys and, with Fran√ßois Besse (a highly accomplished escaper in his own right), and another man, Mesrine got out of a cellblock and into a fenced-off yard walkway. They had a grappling iron with them and Mesrine forced some workmen with an extending ladder to bring the ladder along. The trio unlocked a yard gate in an inner wall; an armed guard was taken by surprise at his post. The men then reached an isolated part of the 14 metre (46 ft) high exterior wall (which would have presented a considerable challenge without the ladder). They hooked the grappling iron onto the top of the ladder and slid down the rope. The third man over the wall was shot dead by police in the street outside. Mesrine and Besse hijacked a car and evaded the police cordon; they had become the first men to escape from La Sant√©. =Mesrine as fugitive= Mesrine and Besse robbed a Paris gunsmith four days after their escape from La Sant√©. On May 26, 1978, the duo robbed the Deauville Casino of 130,000 francs, but the police arrived as they exited. Around 50 shots were exchanged and Mesrine was wounded, but the duo made a getaway. Mesrine and Besse eluded the subsequent massive sweep of the area by taking a farmer and his family hostage and forcing him to drive them to safety. Subsequently, the kidnapping of a banker netted them 450,000 francs in ransom. Despite his position as \\"French Public Enemy Number One\\" (L'Ennemi Public Num√©ro Un), Mesrine was featured on the cover of the August 4, 1978, Paris Match. In an interview inside, he threatened the Minister of Justice. By remaining at large in the Paris area, despite his notoriety, Mesrine appeared to be making a fool of the law and the state; the Paris Match interview was the last straw. The police agencies hunting Mesrine were pressured for results from the highest echelons of government. This proved to be difficult, not least because of rivalry between the various agencies. The usual informants were of little use as Mesrine generally avoided contact with the criminal underworld. Moreover, he was adept at disguising his appearance and allaying suspicion from members of the public: he reportedly went for a drink with his neighbours and laughed when one said he \\"looked like Mesrine\\".Mesrine by Carey Schofield, Penguin Books, 1981.(English) Mesrine travelled to Sicily, Algeria, London, and Brussels, and back to Paris in November 1978, where he again robbed a bank. Objecting to Mesrine's proposed kidnapping of a senior judge, and not sharing his desire for revenge against the system, Fran√ßois Besse disassociated himself from Mesrine and later disappeared. Besse was finally captured in 1994; he was paroled in 2006.French Wikipedia page 'Fran√ßois Besse' Public Enemy No. 1 Mesrine's next exploit occurred in November 1978. It was a daring attempt to kidnap a judge (who had sentenced him) as part of a campaign to get maximum security prisons closed. His accomplice was captured but Mesrine escaped by running downstairs past several policemen telling them \\"Quick! Mesrine's up there!\\" A young policeman posted outside was found handcuffed to a drainpipe weeping. On June 21, 1979, Mesrine kidnapped millionaire real estate mogul Henri Leli√®vre and received a ransom of six million francs. Mesrine made good copy for the press, clowning for the camera and asserting that his criminal activity was politically motivated. Jacques Tillier (a former Directorate of Territorial Security policeman) had written disparagingly about Mesrine in the French newspaper Minute but on September 10, 1979, he went, rather incautiously, to a clandestine meeting with Mesrine on the promise of an interview. The incensed Mesrine had other plans: he shot Tillier in the face, leg and arm. Tillier survived the ordeal, although he lost the use of one arm. During his contact with Mesrine, Tillier discovered the identity of Mesrine's accomplice. Execution The special gendarme unit tasked with finding and capturing Mesrine found it impossible to track him down directly. Eventually, by utilizing information supplied by Tillier, they ascertained the licence number of the car that a woman named Sylvia Jeanjacquot, believed to be Mesrine's mistress, had used and checked parking tickets which it had received months previously. These tickets indicated that she had been frequenting a certain district without any obvious cause. Undercover patrols combed the area and a man fitting Mesrine's description was spotted walking with a woman believed to be Jeanjacquot on October 31, 1979. One officer who had seen Mesrine at court confirmed the identification by noting Mesrine's distinctive build. The couple were followed home and their building watched around the clock. Two days later, on November 2, 1979, the couple left the apartment for a weekend in the country, taking Jeanjacquot's pet poodle with them. Mesrine and Jeanjacquot had reached Porte de Clignancourt on the outskirts of Paris, when the gold BMW they were driving was boxed in at the entrance to an intersection. Police marksmen in the rear of a lorry immediately in front of their car threw open a tarpaulin. Reportedly, in the instant before the gendarmerie opened fire, Mesrine's eyes were described as being so shocked they seemed to be bursting from his head, as he realized he was trapped. Twenty rounds were fired at point blank range. Mesrine was struck 15 times. A coup de gr√¢ce was then administered with a pistol. Sylvia Jeanjacquot lost one eye and suffered lasting damage to her arm. Her pet dog was killed. Aftermath French police announced that their operation was a success and received congratulations from then President Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing. There were suggestions in some media publications that Mesrine may have been shot without warning in a way which amounted to extrajudicial killing, but the police pointed out that he had sworn that he would never surrender and that, as well as having a gun on him, Mesrine had been armed with two grenades which were taped together and adapted so they could be brought into action instantly. Sylvia Jeanjacquot underwent multiple operations and served more than two years in prison before being ultimately acquitted of any crime. Mesrine's former defense attorney, Ma√Ætre Malinbaum, continued for 30 years to fight for a judicial investigation into the events surrounding Mesrine's death at Porte de Clignancourt and to have the French state held accountable for what she saw as the assassination of her client. =Murder of G√©rard Lebovici= By law, Mesrine could not profit from L'instinct de Mort, but the publishers had received a threatening letter from him in 1979 demanding payment nonetheless. L'instinct de Mort was republished in 1984 by Champ Libre Editions,L'Instinct de Mort, Champ Libre Editions, 1984.(French) The founder of Champ Libre, G√©rard Lebovici, was a gifted entrepreneur, influential in the French film industry, and known for his fascination with criminals. Lebovici adopted Mesrine's daughter after her father's death. On March 5, 1984, the body of G√©rard Lebovici was found in the Avenue Foch underground car park. He had been shot dead, with the bullet wounds forming a square: a traditional underworld sign for a contract that has not been fulfilled. One theory is that Lebovici may have been killed by a close associate of Mesrine's with whom Lebovici may have had an appointment on the day of his death.BBC radio interview with Vincent Cassel Pop culture references A film about Mesrine; Mesrine, was released in 1984.

He was the subject of a movie, The Great Impostor, in which he was played by Tony Curtis. Demara's impersonations included a naval surgeon, a civil engineer, a sheriff's deputy, an assistant prison warden, a doctor of applied psychology, a hospital orderly, a lawyer, a child-care expert, a Benedictine monk, a Trappist monk, an editor, a cancer researcher, and a teacher. One teaching job led to six months in prison. There are not many facts that have been proven about Demara, only speculation, as there are only a few articles and movies about him that were created during his lifetime. Demara was said to possess a true photographic memory and was widely reputed to have an extraordinary IQ. He was apparently able to memorize necessary techniques from textbooks and worked on two cardinal rules: The burden of proof is on the accuser and When in danger, attack. He described his own motivation as \\"Rascality, pure rascality\\".  Early life and adulthood  Demara, known locally as 'Fred', was born in Lawrence, Massachusetts, in 1921, at 40 Texas Avenue in the lower southwest Tower Hill Neighborhood. His father, Ferdinand Waldo Demara Sr., was born in Rhode Island and worked in Lawrence's old Theatre District as a motion picture operator. Demara Sr. was financially well-off, and the family lived on Jackson St. in Lawrence, an upper-class neighborhood. Demara Sr.'s brother Napoleon Demara Sr. owned many of the theatres in Lawrence, in which Demara Sr. was an active union member. Early in the Great Depression, Fred's father became financially insolvent, forcing the family to move from the Tower Hill neighborhood to the poorer section in the city. During this financially troubled time, Demara Jr. ran away from home at age 16 to join the Cistercian monks in Rhode Island, where he stayed for several years. He joined the United States Army in 1941.  Impersonations  The following year, Demara began his new lives by borrowing the name of Anthony Ignolia, an army buddy, and going AWOL. After two more attempts in monasteries, he joined the Navy where he trained as a hospital corpsman. He did not reach the position he wanted, faked his suicide and borrowed another name, Robert Linton French, and became a religion-oriented psychologist, who taught psychology at Gannon College (now a university) in Erie, Pennsylvania. Afterwards, Demara served as an orderly in a Los Angeles sanitarium, and served as an instructor in St. Martin's College (now a university) in the state of Washington. The FBI captured him, and he served 18 months at the Naval Disciplinary Barracks, San Pedro, California, for desertion. After his release he assumed a fake identity and studied law at night at Northeastern University, then joined the Brothers of Christian Instruction in Maine, a Roman Catholic order. While at the Brothers of Christian Instruction, he became acquainted with a young doctor named Joseph C. Cyr. That led to his most famous exploit, in which he masqueraded as Cyr, working as a trauma surgeon aboard HMCS Cayuga, a Royal Canadian Navy destroyer, during the Korean War. He managed to improvise successful major surgeries and fend off infection with generous amounts of penicillin. His most notable surgical practices were performed on some sixteen Korean combat casualties who were loaded onto the Cayuga. All eyes turned to Demara, the only \\"surgeon\\" on board, as it became obvious that several of the casualties would require major surgery or certainly die. After ordering personnel to transport these variously injured patients into the ship's operating room and prep them for surgery, Demara disappeared to his room with a textbook on general surgery and proceeded to speed-read the various surgeries he was now forced to perform, including major chest surgery. None of the casualties died as a result of Demara's surgeries. Apparently, the removal of a bullet from a wounded man ended up in Canadian newspapers. One person reading the reports was the mother of the real Joseph Cyr; her son at the time of \\"his\\" service in Korea was actually practicing medicine in Grand Falls, New Brunswick. When news of the impostor reached the Cayuga, still on duty off Korea, Captain James Plomer at first refused to believe Demara was not a doctor (and not Joseph Cyr). However, faced with the embarrassment of having allowed an impostor into the navy's ranks, Canadian officials chose not to press charges. Instead, Demara was quietly dismissed from the Royal Canadian Navy and forced to return to the United States. The MASH episode \\"Dear Dad... Again\\" included a one time character Captain Adam Casey, likely inspired by Demara's exploits, who performs several surgeries, but turns out not to be a real doctor. = Philosophy behind Demara's impersonations = Demara told his biographer he was successful in his roles because he was able to fit into positions which no one else had previously occupied. Demara explained it in the following excerpt from his biography: Demara referred to it as 'expanding into the power vacuum,' and described as such; 'if you come into a new situation (there's a nice word for it) don't join some other professor's committee and try to make your mark by moving up in that committee. You'll, one, have a long haul and two, make an enemy.' Demara's technique was to find his own committee. 'That way there's no competition, no past standards to measure you by. How can anyone tell you aren't running a top outfit? And then there's no past laws or rules or precedents to hold you down or limit you. Make your own rules and interpretations. Nothing like it. Remember it, expand into the power vacuum!' = Founded a college = During Demara's impersonation as Brother John Payne of the Christian Brothers of Instruction (also known as Brothers of Christian Instruction), Demara decided to make the religious teaching order more prominent by founding a college in Alfred, Maine. Demara proceeded on his own, and actually got the college chartered by the state. He then promptly left the religious order in 1951, when the Christian Brothers of Instruction offended him by not naming him as rector or chancellor of the new college and chose what Demara considered a terrible name for the college. The college Demara founded, LaMennais College in Alfred, Maine, began in 1951 (when Demara left); in 1959 it moved to Canton, Ohio, and in 1960, became Walsh College (now Walsh University). = Minor fame = After this episode, he sold his tale to Life and worked in short-term jobs, since he had become widely known. Only after he returned to his old tricks and possessed fake credentials could he get another job at a prison in Huntsville, Texas. According to his biographer, Demara's past became known and his position untenable when an inmate found a copy of Life with an article about the impostor. On November 5, 1959, Demara appeared on the surrealistic game show hosted by Ernie Kovacs, Take a Good Look. The object was for one of the three celebrity panelists to guess his identity. One week later on November 12, 1959, he appeared on an episode of the TV quiz show You Bet Your Life, with Groucho Marx. Demara recounted his exploits, and said the $1,000 he earned on the program was going to be donated to the 'Feed and Clothe Fred Demara Fund'. Demara continued to use new aliases but, as a result of his self-generated publicity, it became much harder to accomplish impersonations than before. In 1960, as a publicity stunt, Demara was given a small acting role in the horror film The Hypnotic Eye. He appears briefly in the film as a (genuine) hospital surgeon. By this point, Demara's girth was so notable that he could not avoid attracting attention. Demara had already been considerably overweight during his impersonation of Joseph C. Cyr.  Later life  In the early 1960s Demara worked as a counselor at the Union Rescue Mission in downtown Los Angeles. In 1967 Demara received a graduate certificate from Multnomah School of the Bible in Portland, Oregon. His first ministerial assignment was a pastor of the Cherry Grove Baptist Church in Gaston, Oregon. He was very well liked but soon plagued with rumors about his old life, causing him to resign the position. Many parishioners felt this was yet another con, though many others felt he was taking the position seriously and had legitimate credentials. Demara had various friendships with a wide variety of notable people during his life, including a close relationship with actor Steve McQueen, to whom Demara delivered last rites in November 1980. When Demara's past exploits and infamy were discovered in the late 1970s, he was almost dismissed from the Good Samaritan Hospital of Orange County in Anaheim, California, where he worked as a visiting chaplain. Chief of Staff Philip S. Cifarelli, who had developed a close personal friendship with Demara, personally vouched for him and Demara was allowed to remain as chaplain. Demara was a very active and appreciated minister, serving a variety of patients in the hospital. Few of those with whom he interacted at the hospital knew of his colorful past. Due to limited financial resources and his friendships with Cifarelli and Jerry Nilsson, one of the major owners of the hospital, Demara was allowed to live in the hospital until his death, even after illness forced him to stop working for them in 1980. Demara died on June 7, 1982, at the age of 60 due to heart failure and complications from his diabetic condition, which had required both of his legs to be amputated. According to his obituary in The New York Times, he had been living in Orange County, California, for eight years. He died at Nilsson's home in Anaheim, California.  In media  Demara's story was recounted in the 1960 book, The Great Impostor, written by Robert Crichton and published by Random House; the book was a New York Times bestseller and adapted into a 1961 film by the same name starring Tony Curtis as Demara. A second book by Crichton, The Rascal and the Road, recounted Demara and Crichton's experiences together as Crichton conducted research for The Great Impostor. =Music= * The Band recorded a song, \\"Ferdinand the Imposter\\", released on a 2005 reissue of The Basement Tapes. * The Fleetwoods recorded a song, \\"(He's) The Great Imposter\\", which was inspired by Demara's story., p. 245 = Books = = Films/TV = * The Great Impostor (1960) is a feature film of a fictionalised version of Demara's life, starring Tony Curtis as Demara. * In \\"Dear Dad Again\\", a 1973 episode of the TV series M*A*S*H, Hawkeye exposes a fraudulent surgeon; the plot was inspired by Demara. * The protagonist of the TV series The Pretender, Jarod, is inspired by (but not based on) Demara. * In the animated series One Piece, a character named Demaro Black impersonated the main character, referring to Demara's impersonations.

Barry obtained a medical degree from the University of Edinburgh Medical School, then served first in Cape Town, South Africa, and subsequently in many parts of the British Empire. Before retirement, Barry had risen to the rank of Inspector General (equivalent to Brigadier General) in charge of military hospitals, the second highest medical office in the British Army. Barry not only improved conditions for wounded soldiers, but also the conditions of the native inhabitants, and performed the first recorded caesarean section by a European in Africa in which both the mother and child survived the operation. Although Barry's entire adult life was lived as a man, Barry was named Margaret Ann Bulkley at birth and was known as female in childhood. Barry lived as a man in both public and private life, at least in part in order to be accepted as a university student and pursue a career as a surgeon, with Barry's birth sex only becoming known to the public and to military colleagues after death through autopsy. Early life Other than some personal correspondence, there are few sources of information about the non-military parts of Barry's life. The scant available evidence provides a skeleton onto which a great deal of myth and speculation has been added by various commentators. In his detailed research into Barry's early life, Michael Du Preez states that Barry was born in Cork in 1789, a birth date based on Mrs Bulkley's description of her child being fifteen years old in a letter dated 14 January 1805. Various other sources give birth dates of 1792, 1795, and 1799, but these dates are almost certainly the result of Barry later lying about age on official documents to aid passing as a man. Barry was the second child born to Jeremiah and Mary-Ann Bulkley, and was given the name Margaret Anne. Mary-Ann Bulkley was the sister of James Barry, a celebrated Irish artist and professor of painting at London's Royal Academy. Jeremiah Bulkley ran the weigh house in Merchant's Quay, Cork. However, anti- Catholic sentiment led to his dismissal from this post. This and subsequent financial mismanagement left Mary-Ann and Barry without the support of either Jeremiah Bulkley (whose debts led to him spending time in the Marshalsea prison in Dublin) or later the Bulkleys' married son John. A third child appeared in the Bulkley family and was named Juliana. Although presented as being Barry's sister, it is likely that she was Barry's daughter as a result of childhood sexual assault, as the charwoman who discovered Barry's sex when laying out the body stated that pregnancy stretch marks were present. The teenage Barry was educated with the prospect of becoming a tutor, but given a lack of evidence of any work history, the Bulkleys appear to have struggled to find Barry any suitable tutoring positions. A conspiracy appears to have developed between Barry, Mary-Ann Bulkley and some of the late James Barry's influential, liberal-minded friends (General Francisco de Miranda, Dr Edward Fryer, who had become Barry's personal tutor, and Daniel Reardon, the family's solicitor) to enable the teenage Barry to enter medical school. The University of Edinburgh was chosen and Mary-Ann and Barry boarded a Leith smack on 30 November 1809. And so, Margaret Anne Bulkley became James Barry, nephew of the late James Barry RA the Irish romantic painter and remained known thus for the next 56 years. In a letter to Daniel Readon, sent on 14 December, Barry asked for any letters addressed to Margaret Bulkley to be forwarded to Mary-Ann Bulkley (whom Barry now refers to as \\"my aunt\\"), and mentions that '...it was very usefull for Mrs. Bulkley (my aunt) to have a Gentleman to take care of her on Board Ship and to have one in a strange country...'. Although the letter was signed \\"James Barry\\", the solicitor indiscreetly wrote on the back of the envelope 'Miss Bulkley, 14 December'; this crucial piece of evidence was the one which enabled researchers to finally confirm that Margaret Bulkley and James Barry were one and the same. Arriving in Edinburgh in November 1809, Barry began studies at the Medical School as a 'literary and medical student'. Barry's short stature, unbroken voice, delicate features and smooth skin led many to suspect that Barry was a young boy not past puberty, and the University Senate initially attempted to block Barry's application for the final examinations due to this apparent youth. However, the Earl of Buchan, a friend of Dr Fryer and Barry's late namesake, persuaded the Senate to relent and Barry qualified Medicinae Doctor (MD) in 1812. Barry then moved back to London, signing up for the Autumn Course 1812/1813 as a pupil of the United Hospitals of Guy's and St Thomas', whose teachers included Henry Cline and celebrated surgeon Astley Cooper. On 2 July 1813, Barry successfully passed the examination of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. Career Portrait of James Barry, painted circa 1813‚Äì1816 Upon joining the army, Barry was commissioned as a Hospital Assistant in the British Army on 6 July 1813, taking up posts in Chelsea and then the Royal Military Hospital in Plymouth, achieving a promotion to Assistant Surgeon to the Forces, equivalent to lieutenant, on 7 December 1815. Following this military training, Barry was posted to Cape Town, South Africa in 1816. Through Lord Buchan, Barry had a letter of introduction to the Governor, Lieutenant General Lord Charles Henry Somerset. Following the successful, even spectacular, treatment of Lord Charles's sick daughter, Barry was welcomed into the family, maintained a close friendship with the Governor, and became his personal physician. In 1822 Somerset appointed Barry as Colonial Medical Inspector, an extraordinary jump in expectations from Barry's low military rank which brought with it great responsibility. Over ten years of work in the Cape, Barry effected significant changes, among them improvements to sanitation and water systems, improved conditions for enslaved people, prisoners and the mentally ill, and provision of a sanctuary for the leper population. Barry also performed one of the first known successful Caesarean sections in which both mother and child survived; the child was christened James Barry Munnik in Barry's honour, and the name was passed down through the family, leading to Barry's name being borne by a later Prime Minister of South Africa, J. B. M. Hertzog. Barry also gained enemies by criticising local officials and their handling of medical matters, but the advantage of a close relationship with the Governor meant that the repercussions of these outspoken views were usually smoothed over. Barry was promoted to Surgeon to the Forces on 22 November 1827. Barry's subsequent posting was to Mauritius in 1828. In 1829, Barry risked a great deal of trouble by going absent without leave to return to England and treat Somerset, who had fallen ill, and remained there until Somerset's death in 1831. Barry's subsequent posting was to Jamaica, and then the island of Saint Helena in 1836. At St Helena, one clash with a fellow army surgeon resulted in Barry being arrested and court-martialled on a charge of \\"conduct unbecoming of the character of an Officer and a Gentleman\\". Barry was found not guilty, and honourably acquitted. In 1840 Barry was posted to the Leeward Islands and Windward Islands of the West Indies, there focusing on medicine, management and improving the conditions of the troops, and receiving a promotion to Principal Medical Officer. In 1845, Barry contracted yellow fever and left for England for sick leave in October. After being cleared for duty, Barry was posted to Malta in 1846. Here Barry was severely reprimanded for inexplicably taking a seat in the local church that was reserved for the clergy, and had to deal with the threat ‚Äì and eventual actuality ‚Äì of a cholera epidemic, which broke out in 1850. The following posting was to Corfu in 1851, which brought with it a promotion to the rank of Deputy Inspector-General of Hospitals on 16 May, equivalent to lieutenant colonel. From here, Barry temporarily visited the Crimea on leave ‚Äî as a request to be posted there officially had been denied ‚Äî where an argument took place between Barry and Florence Nightingale at Scutari Hospital. Finally, in 1857 Barry was posted to Canada, and granted the local rank of Inspector General of Hospitals (equivalent to Brigadier General) on 25 September. In that position, Barry fought for better food, sanitation and proper medical care for prisoners and lepers, as well as soldiers and their families. This local rank was confirmed as substantive on 7 December 1858. Barry (left) with John, a servant, and Barry's dog Psyche, c. 1862, Jamaica Wherever Barry served across the British Empire, improvements were made to sanitary conditions and the conditions and diet of both the common soldier and other, under-represented groups. Barry was outraged by unnecessary suffering, and took a heavy-handed and sometimes tactless approach to demanding improvements for the poor and underprivileged which often incited anger from officials and military officers; on several occasions Barry was both arrested and demoted for the extremity of this behaviour. Barry held strict and unusually modern views about nutrition, being completely vegetarian and teetotal, and, while keeping most personal relationships distant, was very fond of pets, particularly a beloved poodle named Psyche. Playwright Jean Binnie's radio play Doctor Barry (BBC, 1982) identified John Joseph Danson as the black servant Barry first employed in South Africa and who remained with Barry until the doctor's death. Death Despite protesting the decision, Barry was forcefully retired by the army on 19 July 1859 due to ill health and old age, and was succeeded as inspector general of hospitals by David Dumbreck. After a quiet retirement in London, Barry finally died from dysentery on 25 July 1865. The identity of the woman who discovered the truth of Barry's sex is disputed, but she was probably a charwoman who also laid out the dead. The charwoman, after failing to elicit payment for her services, sought redress in another way; she visited Barry's physician, Major D. R. McKinnon, who had issued the death certificate upon which Barry was identified as male. The woman claimed that Barry's body had been biologically female and had marks suggesting Barry had at one point borne a child. When McKinnon refused to pay her, she took the story to the press, and the situation became public. It was discussed in an exchange of letters between George Graham of the General Register Office, and Dr McKinnon. > Sir, It has been stated to me that Inspector-General Dr James Barry, who > died at 14 Margaret Street on 25 July 1865, was after his death found to be > female. As you furnished the Certificate as to the cause of his death, I > take the liberty of asking you whether what I have heard is true, and > whether you yourself ascertained that he was a woman and apparently had been > a mother? Perhaps you may decline answering these questions; but I ask them > not for publication but for my own information. Your faithful servant George > Graham McKinnon's response was as follows: > Sir, I had been intimately acquainted with the doctor for good many years, > both in London and the West Indies and I never had any suspicion that Dr > Barry was a woman. I attended him during his last illness, (previously for > bronchitis, and the affection for diarrhoea). On one occasion after Dr > Barry‚Äôs death at the office of Sir Charles McGregor, there was the woman who > performed the last offices for Dr Barry was waiting to speak to me. She > wished to obtain some prerequisites [sic in source, but has to be a slip for > perquisites, \\"perks\\"] of his employment, which the Lady who kept the lodging > house in which Dr Barry died had refused to give her. Amongst other things > she said that Dr Barry was a female and that I was a pretty doctor not to > know this and she would not like to be attended by me. I informed her that > it was none of my business whether Dr Barry was a male or a female, and that > I thought that she might be neither, viz. an imperfectly developed man. She > then said that she had examined the body, and was a perfect female and > farther that there were marks of him having had a child when very young. I > then enquired how have you formed that conclusion. The woman, pointing to > the lower part of her stomach, said ‚Äòfrom marks here. I am a maried woman > and the mother of nine children and I ought to know.‚Äô The woman seems to > think that she had become acquainted with a great secret and wished to be > paid for keeping it. I informed her that all Dr Barry‚Äôs relatives were dead, > and that it was no secret of mine, and that my own impression was that Dr > Barry was a Hermaphrodite. But whether Dr Barry was a male, female, or > hermaphrodite I do not know, nor had I any purpose in making the discovery > as I could positively swear to the identity of the body as being that of a > person whom I had been acquainted with as Inspector-General of Hospitals for > a period of years. Yours faithfully, D.R. McKinnon After the matter was made public, many people claimed to have \\"known it all along\\". The British Army, seeking to suppress the story, sealed all records of Barry for the next 100 years. The historian Isobel Rae gained access to the army records in the 1950s, and concluded that James Barry the painter was indeed Barry's uncle. Barry was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery, with a Portland stone headstone inscribed Dr James Barry Inspector General of Hospitals. It was claimed by several sources that the manservant who always attended Barry returned to Jamaica, but his actual fate is unknown. Gender and personal life In a letter chiding John Bulkley, Barry's older brother, for abandoning legal studies for the military, 19-year-old Barry wrote: \\"Was I not a girl I would be a Soldier!\\". Barry's interest in medicine was probably encouraged by the liberal-minded friends of the late James Barry RA, and just before travelling to Edinburgh to enroll as a medical student in 1809, Barry assumed a male identity. A short stature, slight build, unbroken voice, delicate features and smooth skin led others to suspect that Barry was not a man but a pre-pubescent boy. This identity was maintained through surgical training and recruitment into the British Army which, at officer rank level, did not then require a medical examination. During Barry's first posting abroad to Cape Town in South Africa, Barry became a close friend of the Governor, Lord Charles Somerset, and his family. It has been suggested that Lord Charles discovered Dr Barry's secret and that the relationship was more than friendship. Their closeness led to rumours and ultimately an accusation briefly appearing on a bridge post in Cape Town on 1 June 1824 saying that the writer had \\"detected Lord Charles buggering Dr Barry\\", which led to a court trial and investigation, as homosexuality was at that time strictly illegal. Despite these allegations, if Somerset was aware of Barry's sex, he did not reveal it. Despite efforts to appear masculine, witness reports comment on Barry's effeminacy and on a somewhat contradictory reputation ‚Äì Barry had a reputation for being tactless, impatient, argumentative and opinionated, but was also considered to have had a good bedside manner and famous professional skill. Barry's temper and bravado led to a famous pistol duel with Captain Josias Cloete of the 21st Light Dragoons. Barry's aim was better, the bullet striking Cloete's shako military cap and removing its peak, which dissipated its force. During the Crimean War (1854‚Äì1856), Barry got into an argument with Florence Nightingale. After Barry's death Nightingale wrote that: > I never had such a blackguard rating in all my life ‚Äì I who have had more > than any woman ‚Äì than from this Barry sitting on his horse, while I was > crossing the Hospital Square with only my cap on in the sun. \\"He\\" kept me > standing in the midst of quite a crowd of soldiers, Commissariat, servants, > camp followers, etc., etc., every one of whom behaved like a gentleman > during the scolding I received while \\"he\\" behaved like a brute . . . After > \\"he\\" was dead, I was told that (Barry) was a woman . . . I should say that > (Barry) was the most hardened creature I ever met. Barry would never allow anyone into the room while undressing, and repeated a standing instruction that \\"in the event of his death, strict precautions should be adopted to prevent any examination of his person\\" and that the body should be \\"buried in [the] bed sheets without further inspection\\".  Intersex controversy  picked up on Major McKinnon's statement that he did not know whether Barry was \\"male, female or hermaphrodite\\" and suggested that it might be more appropriate to say that Barry was \\"hermaphrodite\\" [or intersex] rather than \\"female\\", and \\"may have had ambiguous genitalia\\". These suppositions are based on the premise that \\"Concealment of one's sex for ... 40 years in the British Army, is simply unbelievable\\". However, show how Barry might have been able to conceal this secret from all but a few people, and those who did know did not reveal it while Barry was alive. N. Turner has commented on Kubba and Young's conclusion that the belief in an intersex condition was based on \\"vanishingly slim evidence\\". also raises the possibility of Barry being intersex, but acknowledges the impossibility of knowing, expressing surprise that this is a problem for so many people. The suggestion that Barry may have been intersex has been criticised for both biological and social reasons. In a review of Holmes' biography, firmly rejects the implication that Barry might have been intersex. , among other LGBT theorists, has voiced the opinion that the intersex theory is an attempt to impose \\"cisgender male\\" characteristics onto Barry so as to undermine the concept that a transgender man could have achieved as much as Barry did. In popular culture The story of James Barry is briefly told in Zoya Voskresenskaya's novel Devochka v Burnom More (Girl in the Stormy Sea, 1969), whose action takes place during WWII. A 1982 BBC Radio 4 production appears to be the first dramatic representation of Barry. The 45-minute play, \\"Dr Barry\\" by Jean Binnie, was re-broadcast as recently as 2018. In 1994, Anna Massey played Barry in an episode of the BBC drama-documentary The Experiment. Barry was compared with Hannah Cullwick, who \\"was experimented on by Arhur Munby, who believed that women in servile labour could earn a nobility of the soul\\". Barry's life is the subject of the historical novel James Miranda Barry (published in the United States as The Doctor) by Patricia Duncker. A 2004 play, Whistling Psyche by Sebastian Barry, imagines a meeting between James Barry and Florence Nightingale. In 2012, the UK folk duo Gilmore and Roberts included a song about Barry called Doctor James on their album The Innocent Left. In April 2018, Rachel Weisz said that she is developing a biopic of Barry, and intends to produce and star in it. In February 2019, E.J. Levy's novel about Barry was acquired by Little, Brown and Company. The announcement was met with controversy because Levy refers to Barry as \\"she\\" and a \\"heroine,\\" though Levy has stated that the novel also refers to Barry as \\"he\\" and \\"I\\". The publisher has stated that they \\"will work with E.J.

For decades, Tipton assumed a male gender identity. Tipton's female birth sex was not publicly revealed until after his death, and the revelation came as a surprise to family and friends. Tipton's music career began in the mid-1930s when he led a band for radio broadcasts. He played in various dance bands in the 1940s and recorded two trio albums for a small record label in the mid-1950s. Thereafter, he worked as a talent broker. Tipton stopped performing in the late 1970s due to arthritis.  Early life  Born Dorothy Lucille Tipton in Oklahoma City, Tipton grew up in Kansas City, Missouri, where he was raised by an aunt after his parents divorced when he was four. As a high school student, Tipton went by the nickname \\"Tippy\\" and became interested in music (especially jazz), playing piano and saxophone. Tipton was not allowed to join the all-male school band at Southwest High School. He returned to Oklahoma for his final year of high school and joined the school band at Connors State College High School. Around 1933, Tipton started binding his breasts and dressing as a man to fit in with the typical jazz band image of the era. As Tipton began a more serious music career, he \\"decided to permanently take on the role of a male musician\\", adopting the name Billy Lee Tipton. By 1940, Tipton was living as a man in private life as well.  Career = Early work = In 1936, Tipton was the leader of a band playing on KFXR radio. In 1938, Tipton joined Louvenie's Western Swingbillies, a band that played on radio station KTOK and had a steady gig at Brown's Tavern. In 1940 he was touring the Midwest playing at dances with Scott Cameron's band. In 1941 he began a two and a half-year run performing at the Joplin, Missouri, Cotton Club with George Meyer's band before touring with the Ross Carlyle Band for a while. He then played music in Texas for two years. In 1949, Tipton began touring the Pacific Northwest with Meyer. While this tour was far from glamorous, the band's appearances at Roseburg, Oregon's Shalimar Room were recorded by a local radio station, and so recordings exist of Tipton's work during this time, including \\"If I Knew Then\\" and \\"Sophisticated Swing\\". The trio's signature song was \\"Flying Home\\", performed in a close imitation of pianist Teddy Wilson and Benny Goodman's band. As George Meyer's band became more successful, they began getting more work, performing at the Boulevard Club in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, sharing the bill with others such as The Ink Spots, the Delta Rhythm Boys, and Billy Eckstine. = Bandleader = Tipton began playing piano alone at Elks club in Longview, Washington, in 1951. In Longview, he started the Billy Tipton Trio, which included Dick O'Neil on drums, and Kenny Richards (and later Ron Kilde) on bass. The trio gained local popularity. In 1956, while on tour performing at King's Supper Club in Santa Barbara, California, a talent scout from Tops Records heard them play and got them a contract. The Billy Tipton Trio recorded two albums of jazz standards for Tops: Sweet Georgia Brown and Billy Tipton Plays Hi-Fi on Piano, both released early in 1957. Among the pieces performed were \\"Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man\\", \\"Willow Weep for Me\\", \\"What'll I Do\\", and \\"Don't Blame Me\\". In 1957, the albums sold 17,678 copies, a \\"respectable\\" sum for a small independent record label. In 1958, after the success of both albums, the Billy Tipton Trio was offered a position as house band at the Holiday Hotel casino in Reno, Nevada, as well as open for fellow musician Liberace. Tops Records also invited the trio to record four more albums. Tipton declined both offers, choosing instead to move to Spokane, Washington, where he worked as a talent broker and the trio performed weekly. In the late 1970s, worsening arthritis forced Tipton to retire from music.  Personal life  Tipton was never legally married, but there were five women who called themselves Mrs. Tipton at various points. In 1934, Tipton began living with a woman named Non Earl Harrell in a relationship that other musicians thought of as lesbian. The relationship ended in 1942. Tipton's sex was reportedly concealed from the four women who would later call themselves \\"Mrs. Tipton\\". Tipton kept the secret of his extrinsic sexual characteristics from them by telling them he had been in a serious car accident that resulted in damaged genitals and broken ribs. Tipton's next relationship, with a singer known only as \\"June\\", lasted for several years. For seven years, Tipton lived with Betty Cox, who was 18 years old when they became involved. Cox remembered Tipton as \\"the most fantastic love of my life\\". In 1954, Tipton's relationship with Cox ended, and he then entered a relationship with a woman named Maryann. The pair moved to Spokane, Washington, in 1958. Maryann later stated that in 1960, she discovered that Tipton had become involved with nightclub dancer Kitty Kelly. Tipton and Kelly settled down together in 1961. They adopted three sons, John, Scott, and William. After they separated around 1977, Tipton resumed a relationship with Maryann. Maryann reportedly discovered Tipton's birth certificate and asked Tipton about it once, but was given no reply other than a \\"terrible look\\".  Death, post-mortem outing, and aftermath  In 1989, at the age of 74, Tipton had symptoms which he attributed to the emphysema he had contracted from heavy smoking and refused to call a doctor. He was actually suffering from a hemorrhaging peptic ulcer which, untreated, was fatal. While paramedics were trying to save Tipton's life, his son, William, learned that his father was physically female. This information \\"came as a shock to nearly everyone, including the women who had considered themselves his wives, as well as his sons and the musicians who had traveled with him\\". In an attempt to keep Tipton's biological sex a secret, Kitty arranged for his body to be cremated; later, following financial offers from the media, Kitty and one of their sons went public with the story. The first newspaper article was published the day after Tipton's funeral and it was quickly picked up by wire services. Stories about Tipton appeared in a variety of papers including tabloids such as National Enquirer and Star as well as People, The New York Times and The Seattle Times. Tipton's family even made talk show appearances. Tipton left two wills: one handwritten and not notarized that left everything to William Jr.; and the second, notarized, leaving everything to John Clark, the first child the Tiptons adopted. A court upheld the first will, and William inherited almost everything, with John and Scott receiving one dollar each. According to a 2009 episode of the documentary program The Will: Family Secrets Revealed, which featured interviews with all three sons, it was revealed that a final court judgment awarded all three sons an equal share of his wife Kitty Tipton's estate (not Billy Tipton's), which, after lawyers' fees, amounted to $35,000 for each son.

It is located in the Balkans and has a rivalry with the fictional neighbouring country of Syldavia. Borduria is depicted in King Ottokar's Sceptre and The Calculus Affair, and is referred to in Tintin and the Picaros. Its rival countries in the area are Syldavia and Khemed. Appearances in Tintin books In King Ottokar's Sceptre, Tintin reads a Syldavian tourist pamphlet that reveals the early history of Syldavia and its relationship with Borduria. In 1195, Syldavia was annexed by neighbouring Borduria due to the weakness of King Muskar II, and was under its rule until 1275, when Baron Almaszout drove the Bordurians away and established himself as King Ottokar I. In the later Tintin stories, this ancient rivalry continues with the Bordurians continually trying to invade or undermine Syldavia. Heinkel He 118 used by Herg√© to draw his airplane in 1939. The Swastika was replaced by another geometrical form. King Ottokar's Sceptre (written in 1939 by Herg√©) depicts an unsuccessful Bordurian attempt at staging a coup d'√©tat against Syldavia, trying to remove the king and invade the country with the support from Syldavian sympathizers. The sceptre is stolen, which would force the King to abdicate, however Tintin returns it in time. The Bordurians then withdraw their troops 15 miles from the borders to prove their peaceful intentions. In The Calculus Affair (1956), Borduria is depicted as a stereotypical Eastern Bloc country with its own secret police (ZEP) (led by Colonel Sponsz) and a military dictator, Marshal K√ªrvi-Tasch. A statue of K√ªrvi-Tasch appears in front of a government building, in which he wears a moustache similar to Joseph Stalin's and gives a Nazi-like salute. The Bordurian military of this period is depicted as technologically inept‚Äîunable to stop a stolen tank commandeered by Tintin and his companions as a result of defective mines and anti-tank guns. Professor Calculus is kidnapped by the Bordurians after developing an ultrasonic weapon but is rescued in the end. In Tintin and the Picaros (1976), the South American banana republic of San Theodoros, ruled by General Tapioca, has formed an alliance with the Bordurian government, which has sent him military advisors, including Colonel Sponsz. In an unpublished page drawn by Herg√© for this book, a bust of K√ªrvi-Tasch can even be seen in the office of a San Theodorean colonel. Eventually, Tapioca is deposed by Tintin's friend General Alcazar, and Sponsz is offered to return to Borduria. Geography The Bordurian countryside is set in dramatic mountainous terrain. The craggy landscape and towering peaks are most similar to the Balkan Mountains in Moesia. Therefore, it is possible that Borduria is set roughly in the present-day locations of Bulgaria and Serbia. The capital of Borduria is Szoh√¥d, which is also the seat of government. Government and military Old flag of Borduria (from 1939 black and white edition of King Ottokar's Sceptre) Alternative interpretation of 1939 black and white edition Old flag of Borduria (from 1947 color edition of King Ottokar's Sceptre) Post- war flag of Borduria (from 1956 The Calculus Affair) Variant of post-war flag Borduria is a fascist country with a semi totalitarian government. Several Central European countries such as Hungary, Croatia, Albania and Romania were run by fascist governments before and during World War II. All became client states of the Soviet Union after the war; Borduria may be presumed to be in a similar situation. In Tintin post-war stories it is depicted as a typical Eastern Bloc country. The fact that the president of state bears the military rank of Marshal is a reference to Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, Romania's wartime leader Ion Antonescu and Yugoslavia's post-war president Josip Broz Tito. However, the leader's cult of personality most resembles Joseph Stalin. The army in pre-war King Ottokar's Sceptre is depicted as German-supplied, the main aircraft being Bf-109. In post-war stories it has all the characteristics of the Soviet military. In Tintin and the Picaros the San Theodoros army is supplied by Borduria with Beretta AR70/90 assault-rifles and Mil Mi-1 helicopters. Also the government state limousine with Kurvi-Tasch's mustaches is inspired by the Soviet ZIL-114. In King Ottokar's Sceptre, the Bordurian flag is black with a red circle and two black triangles, reminiscent of the stark, eye-catching symbols used by several Fascist movements. In The Calculus Affair, it is red, with the emblem of Kurvi-Tasch's mustache inside a white circle, resembling it closer to the Nazi flag, and this was also worn as military armbands by the Bordurian military personnel. In King Ottokar's Sceptre, the Bordurian army uses the Gewehr 98, vz. 24 and Karabiner 98k bolt action rifles. In The Calculus Affair, Bordurian soldiers and agents were armed with Italian Beretta Model 38 Submachine Guns. Due to the nature of its government and its military's weaponry, Borduria was most likely an affiliate of the Axis during World War II, although there is no explicit mention of that in the books. The post-war emblem of Borduria is similar to the circumflex symbol, and is modelled in the likeness of the mustache of Marshal K√ªrvi- Tasch. In The Calculus Affair, evidence of the cult of personality surrounding the Marshal can be found in countless objects in Borduria, from the lettering on signs and buildings to the logos of Bordurian companies and even certain characteristics and details on cars, including the car bumpers, include the shape in their designs.  Language  The Tintin books depict the country's language, Bordurian, only in fragments. Like Syldavian, the language seems to be based on the Dutch Brussels dialect Marols, such as for \\"mister\\" or \\"sir\\" (cf. Dutch ). Unlike Syldavian, it uses the Latin alphabet exclusively, and makes heavy use of the digraph sz (possibly borrowed from Hungarian), as well as √¥. People and history (Although the history and people of Borduria have not been described in detail by Herg√© in Tintin, the comics leave creative license to imagine possible narratives for these aspects of the fictional nation.) Nomadic Slavs inhabited the modern-day regions of Borduria and Syldavia during the days of the Byzantine Empire until the arrival of the Ottoman Turks during the 16th century under Suleiman the Magnificent. All this followed the Turkish defeat at the hand of the Syldavians during the 12th century. Although the Turks allowed the Bordurians to retain their own Slavic identity, the Turkish language, Ottoman architecture, and culture quickly assimilated into the Bordurian Slavic culture, and created an identity strikingly Turko-Slavic. Throughout the Tintin comics, the Bordurians are portrayed as a typical Balkan ethnicity with both Ottoman and Slavic influences, not unlike the Bosnians or Albanians (in the Calculus Affair, Middle Eastern architecture is presented in the background of Tasch Platz when Tintin is being driven to his hotel). Following a wake of extreme national self-determination against the Austro-Hungarians, who had invaded the Balkans during phase of weakness of the Ottoman Empire prior to the First World War, Borduria's position in the crossfire between the Austro-Hungarian and Serbian conflict in 1914 severely unsettled its economy and still emerging democracy. Over-extending their power, the Bordurian government supported a movement to overthrow King Ottokar of Syldavia, and establish themselves as a hegemonial power in the Balkans in order to create a unified Southern Slavic kingdom.

They were rescheduled for Helsinki, Finland, to be held from July 20 to August 4, 1940, but were cancelled due to the outbreak of World War II. Helsinki and Tokyo eventually hosted the 1952 and 1964 Summer Olympics respectively. 1940 Tokyo Olympics The campaign to choose a city for 1940 began in 1932, with Barcelona, Rome, Helsinki, and Tokyo participating. Tokyo city officials suggested a campaign as a means of international diplomacy following Japan's alienation from the League of Nations due to the Mukden Incident, in which Japan occupied Manchuria and created the puppet state of Manchukuo. While both Tokyo officials and International Olympic Committee (IOC) representatives were behind the campaign, the national government, which was ever more interested in military matters, did not have any strong supporters for such a diplomatic gesture.Sandra Collins.

Monthly magazines and posters were printed and distributed internationally. Construction began on some buildings, and arrangements were made with hotels, travel agents, and airlines for easy access. =Forfeiture of Games= When the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out on July 7, 1937, Kono Ichiro, a member of the Diet (legislature), immediately requested that the Olympics be forfeited.Sandra Collins.

The 1940 Tokyo Games: The Missing Olympics: Japan, the Asian Olympics and the Olympic Movement. p. 149 In March 1938, the Japanese provided reassurances to the IOC at the organization's Cairo conference that Tokyo would still be able to serve as the host city. However, many Diet members in Japan had already openly questioned hosting the Olympics in wartime, and the military was unreasonably demanding that the organizers build the venues from wood because they needed metals for the war front.Ê©ãÊú¨‰∏ÄÂ§´„ÄéÂπª„ÅÆÊù±‰∫¨„Ç™„É™„É≥„Éî„ÉÉ„ÇØ„ÄèÔºàÊó•Êú¨ÊîæÈÄÅÂá∫ÁâàÂçî‰ºö„ÄÅ1994Âπ¥Ôºâ In July, a legislative session was held to decide the matters of the Summer and Winter Olympics and the planned 1940 World's Fair all at once. The World's Fair was only \\"postponed\\", under a belief that Japan would be able to wrap up the war, but the Olympics could not be moved and was canceled.Sandra Collins. The 1940 Tokyo Games: The Missing Olympics: Japan, the Asian Olympics and the Olympic Movement. pp. 161-163 K≈çichi Kido, who would later be instrumental in the surrender of Japan in 1945, announced the forfeiture on July 16, 1938. He closed his speech saying, \\"When peace reigns again in the Far East, we can then invite the Games to Tokyo and take that opportunity to prove to the people of the world the true Japanese spirit.\\" This would come to pass in 1964. Despite the cancellation of the 1940 Olympics, the Tokyo organizing committee released its budget for the Games. In a departure from standard practice, the budget included all capital outlays as well as direct organizing costs. The total budget was ¬•20.1 million, one-third of which would have been paid by the Tokyo metropolitan government. Helsinki and other competitions Equipment manufactured by Yle, the Finnish broadcasting company, for the purpose of broadcasting coverage of the 1940 Games The IOC then awarded the Games to Helsinki, Finland, the city that had been the runner-up in the original bidding process. The Games were then scheduled to be staged from July 20 to August 4, 1940. The Olympic Games were suspended indefinitely following the outbreak of World War II (Winter War in particular) and did not resume until the London Games of 1948. With the Olympics canceled, the major international athletics event of the year turned out to be the annual Finland- Sweden athletics international, held at the new Helsinki Olympic Stadium, exceptionally held as a triple international among Finland, Sweden and Germany. Gliding was due to be an Olympic sport in the 1940 Games after a demonstration at the Berlin Games in 1936. The sport has not been featured in any Games since, though the glider designed for it, the DFS Olympia Meise, was produced in large numbers after the war. Meanwhile, Japan hosted the 1940 East Asian Games in Tokyo, with six participating nations. Helsinki eventually held the 1952 Summer Olympics, while Tokyo held the 1964 Summer Olympics and will hold the 2020 Summer Olympics, although the event has been postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During August 1940, prisoners of war celebrated a \\"special Olympics\\" called the International Prisoner-of-War Olympic Games at Stalag XIII-A in Langwasser, near Nuremberg, Germany. An Olympic flag, 29 by 46 cm in size, was made of a Polish prisoner's shirt and, drawn in crayon, it featured the Olympic rings and banners for Belgium, France, Great Britain, Norway, Poland, and the Netherlands. A feature film, Olimpiada '40, produced by the director Andrzej Kotkowski in 1980 tells the story of these games and of one of the prisoners of war, Teodor Niewiadomski. Torch run Had the 1940 Summer Games been held, a used method of bringing the Olympic Flame from Nazi Germany to Japan was proposed ‚Äî by air delivery, in the Messerschmitt Me 261 Adolfine long-range aircraft, which was designed to have a maximum range of some 11,024 km (6,850 mi) unrefueled.

On 8 June 1913, the stadium was dedicated with the release of 10,000 pigeons. 60,000 people were in attendance.

The Act was signed into law on 21 December 1948 and came into force on 18 April 1949, Easter Monday, the 33rd anniversary of the beginning of the Easter Rising. The Act ended the remaining statutory role of the British monarchy in relation to the state, by repealing the 1936 External Relations Act, which had vested in George VI and his successors those functions which the Act now transferred to the President. Text of Act The Republic of Ireland Act is itself quite short, running to just five brief sections, and is therefore set out in full as follows: = British monarch = Section 1 of the Act repealed the Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936. By doing so the Act abolished the last remaining functions of the British monarch (then George VI) in relation to the Irish state. These functions had related to the issuance and acceptance of letters of credence of diplomatic and consular representatives and the conclusion of international agreements. Section 3 provides that the President of Ireland may instead exercise these functions and any other functions in relation to the state's external (or foreign) relations. =The Commonwealth= At the time the Act came into force, the view of the Irish Taoiseach whose government brought in the Act was that Ireland did not have a King and had not been a member of the Commonwealth since 1936.Taoiseach John A. Costello speaking in the D√°il - The Republic of Ireland Bill, 1948 ‚Äî Second Stage; Wednesday, 24 November 1948 where he said \\"\\"We were not since 1936 a member of the Commonwealth of Nations.\\" His Government's view was that Ireland was already a republic and that the Act would not create a republic but rather achieve a \\"clarification of [Ireland's] constitutional status.\\"Taoiseach John A. Costello speaking in the D√°il - The Republic of Ireland Bill, 1948‚ÄîSecond Stage; Wednesday, 24 November 1948 where he said \\"The clarification of our constitutional status achieved by the Bill will enable us to partake in international relations in a way that has not heretofore been possible.\\" These views were shared by the Irish opposition leader of the time.Opposition leader √âamon de Valera speaking in the D√°il on The Republic of Ireland Bill, 1948‚ÄîSecond Stage; Wednesday, 24 November 1948 Indeed, Irish leaders had on several previous occasions declared that Ireland was a republic and not a Commonwealth member, but that it was associated with the Commonwealth.Taoiseach √âamon de Valera speaking in the D√°il's Committee on Finance; Vote 65‚ÄîExternal Affairs; Tuesday, 17 July 1945: \\"We are an independent Republic, associated as a matter of our external policy with the States of the British Commonwealth. The Irish view of things was not shared by the other members of the Commonwealth. Until Ireland brought the Act into force, it was still regarded by the members as forming part of ‚ÄúHis Majesty‚Äôs dominions‚Äù. When Ireland adopted its 1937 Constitution, which made no reference to the King, the United Kingdom Government announced that it and the other Commonwealth Governments were \\"[still] prepared to treat...Ireland, as a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations.‚ÄùOpposition leader √âamon de Valera speaking in the D√°il's The Republic of Ireland Bill, 1948‚ÄîSecond Stage; Wednesday, 24 November 1948 and quoting a United Kingdom Government statement of 1937 which read \\"We here to-day are not proclaiming a republic anew; we are not establishing a new State...We are simply giving a name to what exists ‚Äî that is, a republican State\\" After all, in their view, the King was still empowered by Ireland to fulfill certain functions as Ireland's statutory agent under the External Relations Act 1936. With that Irish Act now being repealed, there was no longer any basis, however tenuous, to consider Ireland as continuing to have a King or to be part of His Majesty‚Äôs dominions and therefore within the Commonwealth. In their view, Ireland had now declared itself a republic for the first time bringing its membership of the Commonwealth to an end. The London Declaration, which permitted republics to remain within the Commonwealth, was made shortly afterwards in response to India's desire to continue as a member once its new republican constitution was finalised. However, the Irish government opted not to reapply for membership of the Commonwealth, a decision that was criticised by then Leader of the Opposition √âamon de Valera, who considered applying for membership after being returned to power in the 1950s. = Republic of Ireland Description = Section 2 of the Act quite simply provides: Notably, the Act did not change the official name of the state. It merely provided the description for the State. The Constitution of Ireland provides that √âire (or Ireland in English) is the official name of the State and, if the Act had purported to change the name, it would have been unconstitutional as it was not a constitutional amendment. The distinction between a description and a name has sometimes caused confusion. The Taoiseach, John A. Costello, who introduced the Republic of Ireland Bill in the Oireachtas, explained the difference in the following way: Background The Act repealed the External Relations Act, 1936. Under that Act, King George VI acted as the Irish head of state in international relations by accredited ambassadors and on the State's behalf accepted credentials appointing foreign ambassadors to the State. The Republic of Ireland Act removed this last remaining practical role from the King and vested it instead in the President of Ireland, making the then President of Ireland, Se√°n T. O'Kelly, unambiguously the Irish head of state. In 1945, when asked if he planned to declare a Republic, the then Taoiseach √âamon de Valera had replied, \\"we are a republic\\",\\"Seanad √âireann - Volume 30 - 19 July, 1945\\" Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas. Retrieved on 14 March 2007. having refused to say so before for eight years. He also insisted that Ireland had no king, but simply used an external king as an organ in international affairs. However, that was not the view of constitutional lawyers including de Valera's Attorneys-General, whose disagreement with de Valera's interpretation only came to light when the state papers from the 1930s and 1940s were released to historians. Nor was it the view in the international arena, who believed that Ireland did have a king, George VI who had been proclaimed King of Ireland in December 1936, and to whom they accredited ambassadors to Ireland. King George, in turn, as \\"King of Ireland\\" accredited all Irish diplomats. All treaties signed by the Irish Taoiseach or Minister for External Affairs were signed in the name of King George. In October 1947, de Valera asked his Attorney-General, Cearbhall √ì D√°laigh, to draft a bill to repeal the External Relations Act. and by 1948 a draft of the bill included a reference to the state as being a republic. In the end, the draft bill was never submitted to the Oireachtas for approval. Introduction of the bill The bill to declare Ireland a republic was introduced in 1948 by the new Taoiseach, John A. Costello of the Fine Gael party. Costello made the announcement that the bill was to be introduced when he was in Ottawa, during an official visit to Canada. David McCullagh has suggested that it was a spur of the moment reaction to offence caused by the Governor-General of Canada,McCullagh, David The Reluctant Taoiseach Gill and Macmillan 2010 p.210 Lord Alexander, who was of Northern Irish descent, who allegedly placed loyalist symbols, notably a replica of the famous Roaring Meg cannon used in the Siege of Derry, before an affronted Costello at a state dinner. What is certain is that an agreement that there would be separate toasts for the King and for the President of Ireland was broken.McCullagh p.210 The Irish position was that a toast to the King, instead of representing both countries, would not include Ireland. Only a toast to the King was proposed, to the fury of the Irish delegation. Shortly afterwards Costello announced the plan to declare the republic. However, according to all but one of the ministers in Costello's cabinet, the decision to declare a republic had already been made before Costello's Canadian visit.McCullagh pp.205-7 Costello's revelation of the decision was because the Sunday Independent (an Irish newspaper) had discovered the fact and was about to \\"break\\" the story as an exclusive. Nevertheless, one minister, Noel Browne, gave a different account in his autobiography, Against the Tide. He claimed Costello's announcement was done in a fit of anger of his treatment by the Governor-General and that when he returned, Costello, at an assembly of ministers in his home, offered to resign because of his manufacture of a major government policy initiative on the spot in Canada. Yet according to Browne, all the ministers agreed that they would refuse to accept the resignation and also agreed to manufacture the story of a prior cabinet decision. The evidence of what really happened remains ambiguous. There is no record of a prior decision to declare a republic before Costello's Canadian trip, among cabinet papers for 1948, which supports Browne's claim. However, the Costello government refused to allow the Secretary to the Government, Maurice Moynihan, to attend cabinet meetings and take minutes, because they believed he was too close to the opposition leader, √âamon de Valera.McCullagh pp.179-80 Rather than entrust the minute-taking to Moynihan, the cabinet entrusted it to a Parliamentary Secretary (junior minister), Liam Cosgrave. Given that Cosgrave had never kept minutes before, his minutes, at least early on in the government, proved to be only a limited record of government decisions. So whether the issue was never raised, was raised but undecided on, was subjected to a decision taken informally, or was subjected to a decision taken formally, remains obscure on the basis of the 1948 cabinet documentation. At any rate, the Act was enacted with all parties voting for it. De Valera did suggest that it would have been better to reserve the declaration of the republic until Irish unity had been achieved, a comment hard to reconcile with his 1945 claim that the Irish state was already a republic. Speaking in Seanad √âireann Costello told senators that as a matter of law, the King was indeed \\"King of Ireland\\" and Irish head of state and the President of Ireland was in effect no more than first citizen and a local notable, until the new law came into force. Response= United Kingdom= The United Kingdom responded to the Republic of Ireland Act by enacting the Ireland Act 1949. This Act formally asserted that the Irish state had, when the Republic of Ireland Act came into force, ceased ‚Äúto be part of His Majesty‚Äôs dominions‚ÄùSection 1(1) of the Ireland Act 1949 and accordingly was no longer within the Commonwealth. Nonetheless the United Kingdom statute provided that Irish citizens would not be treated as aliens under British nationality law. This, in effect, granted them a status similar to the citizens of Commonwealth countries. Between the enactment of the Constitution of Ireland in 1937 and the enactment of the Ireland Act 1949, the United Kingdom had formally decided upon the (anglicised) \\"Eire\\" as its name for the Irish state. The 1949 Act now provided that \\"the part of Ireland heretofore known as Eire\\" could be referred to in future UK legislation as the \\"Republic of Ireland\\".Ireland Act 1949, s. 1. The UK's continued aversion to using \\"Ireland\\" as the formal name for the state due to the fact it did not (and does not) comprise the entirety of the island of the same name remained a source of diplomatic friction for several decades afterwards. The UK's Ireland Act also gave a legislative guarantee that Northern Ireland would continue to remain a part of the United Kingdom unless the Parliament of Northern Ireland formally expressed a wish to join a United Ireland; this \\"unionist veto\\" proved to be controversial during the Act's passage through Westminster, as well as in the Irish state and amongst Northern Ireland's nationalist community. The guarantee was replaced in 1973, when the Parliament of Northern Ireland was abolished, by a new guarantee based on \\"the consent of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland\\".Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973 s.1. On the day the Act came into force, 18 April 1949, King George VI sent the following message to the President of Ireland, Se√°n T. O'Kelly:The Times, 18 April 1949 Irish peers From the Acts of Union 1800, when the UK House of Lords noted someone's succession to an Irish peerage, the Clerk of the Parliaments informed the Clerk of the Crown in Ireland in Dublin to update the electoral register for Irish representative peers. Such elections ceased in 1922 and the office of Clerk of the Crown was formally abolished in 1926, when the last holder, Gerald Horan, became first Master of the High Court. Nevertheless, the Clerk of the Parliaments continued to inform Horan in the old manner until the Irish government, reviewing administration for the commencement of the Republic of Ireland Act, informed the Lords in late 1948 that the Clerk of the Crown in Ireland no longer existed. =Church of Ireland= The Book of Common Prayer of the all-island Church of Ireland was modelled on that of the Church of England and included three \\"state prayers\\": for \\"our most gracious Sovereign Lord, King George\\", the royal family, and the Commonwealth. The church was historically associated with the Protestant Ascendancy and had been the established church until 1871; its \\"southern\\" membership (one-third of the total) was mostly unionist before 1922 and pro- British thereafter. In late 1948, archbishops John Gregg and Arthur Barton devised replacement prayers to be used in the new republic, at first temporarily until the 1949 general synod would update the Book of Common Prayer. A grassroots campaign led by Hugh Maude of Clondalkin opposed any change, and the 1950 synod authorised a compromise, whereby the old prayers remained in Northern Ireland, and the republic used a \\"Prayer for the President and all in authority\\" and \\"A Prayer for King George the Sixth ... in whose dominions we are not accounted strangers\\" (an allusion to the Ireland Act 1949). Likewise, the liturgy for morning and evening prayers includes \\"O Lord, save the Queen\\" in Northern Ireland and \\"O Lord, guide and defend our rulers\\" in the republic. Miriam Moffitt notes that Maude's supporters were mostly older church members.  Reassessment  In 1996, the Constitution Review Group considered amending the Constitution to declare that Ireland should be named \\"Republic of Ireland\\". It decided against recommending such an amendment. This was the second time that such an amendment was considered by committee.

","title":"Republic of Ireland Act 1948"},{"id":"169531","text":"Chapel Interior The Sedlec Ossuary (; ) is a small Roman Catholic chapel, located beneath the Cemetery Church of All Saints (Czech: H≈ôbitovn√≠ kostel V≈°ech Svat√Ωch), part of the former Sedlec Abbey in Sedlec, a suburb of Kutn√° Hora in the Czech Republic. The ossuary is estimated to contain the skeletons of between 40,000 and 70,000 people, whose bones have, in many cases, been artistically arranged to form decorations and furnishings for the chapel. The ossuary is among the most visited tourist attractions of the Czech Republic, attracting over 200,000 visitors annually.NIPOS: Statistika kultury 2009 - I. d√≠l - kulturn√≠ dƒõdictv√≠ (muzea, galerie a pam√°tkov√© objekty) Four enormous bell-shaped mounds occupy the corners of the chapel. An enormous chandelier of bones, which contains at least one of every bone in the human body, hangs from the center of the nave with garlands of skulls draping the vault. Other works include piers and monstrances flanking the altar, a coat of arms of the House of Schwarzenberg, and the signature of Franti≈°ek Rint, also executed in bone, on the wall near the entrance. History Chapel exterior In 1278, Henry, the abbot of the Cistercian monastery in Sedlec, was sent to the Holy Land by King Otakar II of Bohemia. He returned with a small amount of earth he had removed from Golgotha and sprinkled it over the abbey cemetery. The word of this pious act soon spread and the cemetery in Sedlec became a desirable burial site throughout Central Europe. In the mid 14th century, during the Black Death, and after the Hussite Wars in the early 15th century, many thousands were buried in the abbey cemetery, so it had to be greatly enlarged. Around 1400, a Gothic church was built in the center of the cemetery with a vaulted upper level and a lower chapel to be used as an ossuary for the mass graves unearthed during construction, or simply slated for demolition to make room for new burials. After 1511, the task of exhuming skeletons and stacking their bones in the chapel was given to a half-blind monk of the order. Between 1703 and 1710, a new entrance was constructed to support the front wall, which was leaning outward, and the upper chapel was rebuilt. This work, in the Czech Baroque style, was designed by Jan Santini Aichel. In 1870, Franti≈°ek Rint, a woodcarver, was employed by the Schwarzenberg family to put the bone heaps into order, yielding a macabre result. The signature of Rint, also executed in bone, appears on the wall near the entrance to the chapel. In media In 1970, the centenary of Rint's contributions, Czech filmmaker Jan ≈†vankmajer was commissioned to document the ossuary. The result was a 10-minute-long frantic-cut film of skeletal images overdubbed with an actual tour-guide's neutral voice narration. This version was initially banned by the Czech Communist authorities for alleged subversion, and the soundtrack was replaced by a brief spoken introduction and a jazz arrangement by Zdenƒõk Li≈°ka of the poem \\"Comment dessiner le portrait d'un oiseau\\" (\\"How to Draw the Portrait of a Bird\\") by Jacques Pr√©vert. Since the Velvet Revolution, the original tour guide soundtrack has been made available. In the documentary Long Way Round, Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman stop to see this church. Dan Cruickshank also views the church in his Adventures in Architecture. The ossuary is a major plot device in the John Connolly novel The Black Angel. The ossuary is used as a location for the Dungeons & Dragons movie and the movie Blood & Chocolate. The ossuary was also featured in Ripley's Believe it or Not and is described by Cara Seymour in the final scene of the film Adaptation. The ossuary was also the influence for Dr. Satan's lair in the Rob Zombie film House of 1000 Corpses. File:Sedlec Ossuary Entrance.jpgEntrance File:SedlecInitials.JPGSignature of F.

PCMC's Fusion C Flexographic Printing Press Flexography (often abbreviated to flexo) is a form of printing process which utilizes a flexible relief plate. It is essentially a modern version of letterpress, evolved with high speed rotary functionality, which can be used for printing on almost any type of substrate, including plastic, metallic films, cellophane, and paper. It is widely used for printing on the non-porous substrates required for various types of food packaging (it is also well suited for printing large areas of solid colour). History In 1890, the first such patented press was built in Liverpool, England by Bibby, Baron and Sons. The water-based ink smeared easily, leading the device to be known as \\"Bibby's Folly\\". In the early 1900s, other European presses using rubber printing plates and aniline oil-based ink were developed. This led to the process being called \\"aniline printing\\". By the 1920s, most presses were made in Germany, where the process was called \\"gummidruck\\", or rubber printing. In modern-day Germany, it is continued to be called the process \\"gummidruck\\". During the early part of the 20th century, the technique was used extensively in food packaging in the United States. However, in the 1940s, the Food and Drug Administration classified aniline dyes as unsuitable for food packaging. Printing sales plummeted. Individual firms tried using new names for the process, such as \\"Lustro Printing\\" and \\"Transglo Printing\\", but met with limited success. Even after the Food and Drug Administration approved the aniline process in 1949 using new, safe inks, sales continued to decline as some food manufacturers still refused to consider aniline printing. Worried about the image of the industry, packaging representatives decided the process needed to be renamed. In 1951 Franklin Moss, then the president of the Mosstype Corporation, conducted a poll among the readers of his journal The Mosstyper to submit new names for the printing process. Over 200 names were submitted, and a subcommittee of the Packaging Institute's Printed Packaging Committee narrowed the selection to three possibilities: \\"permatone process\\", \\"rotopake process\\", and \\"flexographic process\\". Postal ballots from readers of The Mosstyper overwhelmingly chose the last of these, and \\"flexographic process\\" was chosen. =Evolution= Originally, flexographic printing was rudimentary in quality. Labels requiring high quality have generally been printed using the offset process until recently. Since 1990, great advances have been made to the quality of flexographic printing presses, printing plates, ink systems and printing inks. The greatest advances in flexographic printing have been in the area of photopolymer printing plates, including improvements to the plate material and the method of plate creation. Digital direct to plate systems have seen a good improvement in the industry recently. Companies like DuPont, Kodak and Esko have pioneered the latest technologies, with advances in fast washout and the latest screening technology. Laser- etched ceramic anilox rolls along with chambered ink systems, have also played a part in the improvement of print quality. Full-color picture printing is now possible, and some of the finer presses available today, in combination with a skilled operator, allow quality that rivals the lithographic process. One ongoing improvement has been the increasing ability to reproduce highlight tonal values, thereby providing a workaround for the very high dot gain associated with flexographic printing. Process overview 1\\\\. PlatemakingPrinters' National Environmental Assistance Center: The first method of plate development uses light-sensitive polymer. A film negative is placed over the plate, which is exposed to ultra-violet light. The polymer hardens where light passes through the film. The remaining polymer has the consistency of chewed gum. It is washed away in a tank of either water or solvent. Brushes scrub the plate to facilitate the \\"washout\\" process. The process can differ depending on whether solid sheets of photopolymer or liquid photopolymer are used, but the principle is still the same. The plate to be washed out is fixed in the orbital washout unit on a sticky base plate. The plate is washed out in a mixture of water and 1% dishwasher soap, at a temperature of approximately 40 ¬∞C. The unit is equipped with a dual membrane filter. With this the environmental burdening is kept to an absolute minimum. The membrane unit separates photopolymer from the washout water. After addition of absorb gelatine for example, the photopolymer residue can be disposed of as standard solid waste together with household refuse. The recycled water is re-used without adding any detergent.AV Flexologic B.V.: Flexographic printing press The second method uses a computer-guided laser to etch the image onto the printing plate. Such a direct laser engraving process is called digital platemaking. Companies such as AV Flexologic, Glunz & Jensen, Xeikon, Esko, Kodak, Polymount, Screen and SPGPrints from The Netherlands are market leaders in manufacturing this type of equipment. The third method is to go through a molding process. The first step is to create a metal plate out of the negative of our initial image through an exposition process (followed by an acid bath). In the early days the metal used was zinc, leading to the name 'zincos'. Later, magnesium was used. This metal plate in relief is then used in the second step to create the mold that could be in bakelite board or even glass or plastic, through a first molding process. Once cooled, this master mold will press the rubber or plastic compound (under both controlled temperature and pressure) through a second molding process to create the printing plate or cliche. 2\\\\. Mounting For every colour to be printed, a plate is made and eventually put on a cylinder which is placed in the printing press. To make a complete picture, regardless of printing on flexible film or corrugated paper, the image transferred from each plate has to register exactly with the images transferred from the other colors. To ensure an accurate picture is made, mounting marks are made on the flexographic plates. These mounting marks can be microdots (down to 0.3 mm) and/or crosses. Special machinery is made for mounting these plates on the printing cylinders to maintain registration. Earle L. Harley invented and patent the Opti-Chek Mounting and Proofing machine enabling the operator to check the registration before going to the press. Precision mounting of flexo plates on tape with the aid of laser pointers on automatic mounting machine Precision mounting is critical for producing good quality print which is in the register and has a direct impact on minimizing waste. The mounting process needs to deliver the same accurate result each time a job is mounted, consistent accuracy is the target. For simplicity we'll refer to print sleeves throughout this module but you can substitute cylinders if these are used in your operation. Generally plates are mounted directly onto the print sleeve but for corrugated operations, plates are mounted onto a carrier sheet that is fixed to the print sleeve in the press when required, it is removed and kept in storage between print runs. You'll find out about carriers in the corrugated section of this module. There are two key areas to achieve effective plate mounting, positioning the plate correctly and achieving a good bond. Positioning is achieved by correctly lining up register marks that are common to each plate in the set. The skill is to plan carefully exactly where these marks should be. A variety of marks can be used, register crosses and micro dots. A good bond is achieved by means of special mounting tape. Accurate positioning is essential or the images of each colour will not be superimposed correctly, they will be out of register. Types of registration marks These are various types of mark used for aligning the plates correctly: Registration crosses are commonly used but need to be positioned in waste areas as they are easily seen on the print, they can also be used as a guide for aligning the print to a bag or box structure if this is required. Micro dots as the name suggests are tiny dots on the plate, usually about a quarter of a millimeter across in labels and flexible packaging but 1mm diameter in corrugated. Since they are so small they don't have to be in waste areas as they are not easily seen. On most mounting machines the dots or crosses on the plates are lined up using magnifying cameras, the higher the magnification the greater the accuracy. Register crosses are more common in label and corrugated printing where waste and hidden folds are normal, the microdot is common in flexible packaging where waste is kept to a minimum and no un-required marks are to be seen on the packaging (example meat, dairy and hygiene). The location of registration marks, whether crosses or microdots, is essential to the success of plate mounting. If they are incorrect, mounting can be difficult, time-consuming and inaccurate, so they need to be planned carefully. The marks should be positioned symmetrically Always have a pair positioned in the middle of the plate in line with the sleeve axis. It is also recommended to have two more pairs, one at either end so a simple rotation and check under the cameras confirms the plate has not twisted when it was laid/stuck down. Register Mark Mounting The most common form of mounting is register mark - also known as video mounting. When the print is run the register marks should print on top of each other indicating that the plates are correctly aligned. The register marks on the plate are lined up using magnifying cameras. To align the plates accurately a mounting system using video cameras is required. Each print sleeve is transferred to the mounting system in turn. Each sleeve is fixed in the mounter by a clamping system and mounting tape is then applied to the sleeve. The high magnification video cameras (positioned on a precision machined camera beam) are moved into the required position for the plate to be mounted, accurate measurement of this setting is critical. The plate is then adhered to the sleeve using a mounting tape (see item 5) and the complete unit removed from the mounting machine. The next sleeve is loaded and the plate mounted in position by positioning the register marks on the plate based on the previously fixed camera positions. This ensures that every plate is mounted in the same position and thus the print is in register. The same principle is applied for multiple plates across the sleeve and so either two cameras per plate are used or two cameras are used which move into the correct position driven by servo motors and camera setting software. To step plates around the sleeve to minimise risk of bounce is done either mechanically using an index disc or by use of stepper motors to drive and lock it in position. Each plate is mounted on a double sided adhesive tape - there are many types of mounting tape and it is important to use the correct thickness and hardness. Adhesive type also needs to be correct for your mounting process (see Tape Features) The tape is applied to the sleeve being careful to lay it on without trapping air underneath it (must be flat to sleeve). A small strip of the tape liner is removed to leave the adhesive exposed initially. The plate is carefully positioned over tape, usually by hand so that the register marks are seen directly below the cameras. The cameras provide an enlarged visual display indicating whether or not the register marks are correctly positioned in line with crosshair targets. If necessary the plate position is adjusted. Automatic Flexo Plate Mounter used for accuracy down to 5 microns without operator dependency Once the plate is accurately aligned, it's pressed onto the strip of exposed mounting tape. The rest of the tape liner is then removed or a plate support table is moved so that the remainder of the plate can be laid onto the sleeve. This is done with each sleeve in turn so that all the plates register correctly. Flexo plate mounting equipment includes many options to increase efficiency. These include tables to lay the plate on to make maneuvering the plate into position simpler, lay down (pressure) rollers to eliminate air bubble inclusions, tape application options, plate and tape cutting options and moving cameras, replacing multiple camera mounting systems. In recent years higher quality demands from customers, shorter and more frequent job runs result in an increasing relative cost of the prepress department. To counter this, automatic mounting provides up to 10x faster plate mounting than traditional plate mounting, no operator dependency and the highest possible accuracy and consistency down to 5 micron (0.0002 inch) per plate. 3\\\\. Printing A flexographic print is made by creating a positive mirrored master of the required image as a 3D relief in a rubber or polymer material. Flexographic plates can be created with analog and digital platemaking processes. The image areas are raised above the non image areas on the rubber or polymer plate. The ink is transferred from the ink roll which is partially immersed in the ink tank. Then it transfers to the anilox or ceramic roll (or meter roll) whose texture holds a specific amount of ink since it is covered with thousands of small wells or cups that enable it to meter ink to the printing plate in a uniform thickness evenly and quickly (the number of cells per linear inch can vary according to the type of print job and the quality required).International Paper - Knowledge center - Flexography: https://web.archive.org/web/20100816235813/http://glossary.ippaper.com/default.asp?req=knowledge%2Farticle%2F151 To avoid getting a final product with a smudgy or lumpy look, it must be ensured that the amount of ink on the printing plate is not excessive. This is achieved by using a scraper, called a doctor blade. The doctor blade removes excess ink from the anilox roller before inking the printing plate. The substrate is finally sandwiched between the plate and the impression cylinder to transfer the image.Johansson, Lundberg & Ryberg (2003) \\"A guide to graphic print production\\", John Wiley & Sons Inc., Hoboken, New Jersey. The sheet is then fed through a dryer, which allows the inks to dry before the surface is touched again. If a UV-curing ink is used, the sheet does not have to be dried, but the ink is cured by UV rays instead. =Basic parts of the press= * Unwind and infeed section ‚Äì The roll of stock must be held under control so the web can unwind as needed. * Printing section ‚Äì Single color station including the fountain or ink chamber, anilox, plate and impression rolls. * Drying station ‚Äì High velocity heated air, specially formulated inks and an after-dryer can be used. * Outfeed and rewind section ‚Äì Similar to the unwind segment, keeps web tension controlled. Operation=Operational overview= Diagram of a typical flexographic printing apparatus, illustrating the general operating principle. 1\\\\. Fountain roller The fountain roller transfers ink located in an ink pan to a second roller, an anilox roller. In modern flexographic printing, the anilox roll is referred to as a type of meter or metering roller. 2\\\\. Anilox roller The anilox roll is a unique characteristic of flexography. The anilox roller transfers a uniform thickness of ink to a flexible printing plate. The anilox roll has finely engraved cells with a particular ink capacity, viewable with a microscope. These rollers are responsible for transferring inks to the flexible printing plates mounted on the plate cylinders. 3\\\\. Doctor blade (optional) An optional doctor blade scrapes the anilox roll to ensure that the ink to be delivered to the flexible printing plate is only what is contained within the engraved cells. Doctor blades had predominantly been made of steel, but advanced doctor blades are now made of polymer materials with several different types of beveled edges. 4\\\\. Plate cylinder The plate cylinder holds the printing plate, which is made from a soft flexible rubber-like material. Tape, magnets, tension straps and/or ratchets hold the printing plate against the plate cylinder. 5\\\\. Impression cylinder The impression cylinder applies pressure to the plate cylinder where the image is transferred to the image-receiving substrate. This impression cylinder or \\"print anvil\\" is required to apply pressure to the plate cylinder. =Flexographic printing inks= The nature and demands of the printing process and the application of the printed product determine the fundamental properties required of flexographic inks. Measuring the physical properties of inks and understanding how these are affected by the choice of ingredients is a large part of ink technology. Formulation of inks requires a detailed knowledge of the physical and chemical properties of the raw materials composing the inks, and how these ingredients affect or react with each other as well as with the environment. Flexographic printing inks are primarily formulated to remain compatible with the wide variety of substrates used in the process. Each formulation component individually fulfills a special function and the proportion and composition will vary according to the substrate. There are five types of inks that can be used in flexography: *solvent-based inks *water-based inks *electron beam (EB) curing inks *ultraviolet (UV) curing inks *two-part chemically-curing inks (usually based on polyurethane isocyanate reactions) - although these are uncommon at the moment Water based flexo inks with particle sizes below 5 ¬µm may cause problems when deinking recycled paper. =Ink controls= The ink is controlled in the flexographic printing process by the ink system. The ink system contains an ink pump, anilox roll and either a fountain roll system or doctor blade system. The fountain roll or two-roll system has one roll spinning in an ink pan pressed against the anilox roll to transfer a layer of ink to then be applied to the printing plate. This system is best used for low quality print such as flood coats and block lettering due to its inability to produce a clean wipe of the anilox roll. The doctor blade system can either be an open single blade system or an enclosed dual blade system. The single blade system uses an open ink pan with a roller that is then sheared with one doctor blade to create a uniform layer of ink to be distributed. The remaining ink sheared from the anilox roll will collect in the ink pan to then be pumped back into the system. This system is best used for low to mid quality print work - usually found in corrugated box printing. The dual blade system is an enclosed system that has one doctor blade for doctoring the ink and one containment blade that contains the ink in the chamber and allows ink from the anilox roll back in. Dual blade systems require 2 end seals and adequate chamber pressure in order to maintain the tight seal between the ink chamber and the anilox roll. This system is best used for high quality, intricate print designs, like those found in the label industry.

This press can only print on one side. Advantage: excellent registration. ; In-line press Color stations are placed horizontally. This press prints on both sides, via a turnbar. Advantage: can print on heavier substrates, such as corrugated boards. Applications Flexo has an advantage over lithography in that it can use a wider range of inks, water based rather than oil based inks, and is good at printing on a variety of different materials like plastic, foil, acetate film, brown paper, and other materials used in packaging. Typical products printed using flexography include brown corrugated boxes, flexible packaging including retail and shopping bags, food and hygiene bags and sacks, milk and beverage cartons, flexible plastics, self-adhesive labels, disposable cups and containers, envelopes and wallpaper. In recent years there has also been a move towards laminates, where two or more materials are bonded together to produce new material with different properties than either of the originals. A number of newspapers now eschew the more common offset lithography process in favour of flexo. Flexographic inks, like those used in gravure and unlike those used in lithography, generally have a low viscosity. This enables faster drying and, as a result, faster production, which results in lower costs. Printing press speeds of up to 750 meters per minute (2000 feet per minute) are achievable now with modern technology high-end printers. Flexo printing is widely used in the converting industry for printing plastic materials for packaging and other end uses. For maximum efficiency, the flexo presses produce large rolls of material that are then slit down to their finished size on slitting machines.

An anilox roll is a hard cylinder, usually constructed of a steel or aluminum core which is coated by an industrial ceramic whose surface is engraved with millions of very fine dimples, known as anilox cells. In the printing process, the anilox roll is coated in a precise layer of ink that is then transferred to the raised portions of the printing plate. The number, size, and geometry of the anilox cells vary and will determine the amount of ink that the anilox roll delivers to the plate. Usage Depending on the detail of the images to be printed, the press operator will select an anilox roll with a higher or lower line screen. \\"Line screen\\" is the term used for the number of cells engraved on the anilox. Low line screen rolls (100-300dpi) are used where a heavy layer of ink is desired, such as in heavy block lettering. Higher line screens (500-1500dpi) produce finer details and are used in four-color process work such as reproducing photographs. Often a job will require a different line screen for each color to be printed. Experienced press operators are skilled at determining the appropriate rolls for a given print job. Depending on the design of the printing press, the anilox roll is either semi-submerged in the ink fountain, or comes into contact with a so-called metering roller, which is semi-submerged in the ink fountain. In either instance, a thick layer of typically viscous ink is deposited on the roller. A doctor blade is used to shave excess ink from the surface leaving just the measured amount of ink in the cells. The roll then rotates to make contact with the flexographic printing plate which receives the ink from the cells for transfer to the printed material. Anilox roll selection should be based on cell volume or capacity of the engraved cells. Print results are accomplished with this volume, which transfers to the printing plate and then to the substrate. In general transfer, efficiency is approximately 25% to the substrate. Cell count remains the same for the life of the roll, while volume changes over time due to wear, plugging and damage. Cell count accommodates volume at various cell shapes available from the laser engraving process. The same cell count can be engraved to or wear to different volumes. Contemporary ink metering systems employ a self contained system known as a chambered doctor blade system which is basically a manifold which delivers ink to the anilox roll. Ink is pumped through a hose to the chamber which fills to capacity. Ink is retained within the system by end seals and doctor blades. One blade works as a retaining blade, simply holding ink within the chamber. The other reverse angle blade works as previously described, removing excess ink from the engraved surface of the anilox roll. Chambered doctor blade systems are recognized for high quality, consistency and accuracy removing the influence of press speed and some human subjectivity. Roll manufacture and specification Optical micrograph of anilox cells. Each cell is about 100 Œºm across. Anilox rolls were originally made using a process of mechanical engraving, utilizing hardened steel tools of various cell counts and cell shapes diamond pecking machine, but modern rolls are laser engraved. The characteristics of an anilox roll determine the amount of ink that will be transferred to the plate: angle of the cells, cell volume, and line screen. A 60 degree angle ensures maximum density in a given space. Lower volume makes for less ink. Low line numbers will allow for a heavy layer of ink to be printed, whereas high line numbers will permit finer detail in printing. Both cell volume and line screen are closely correlated. The rolls are often specified by their line screen, which is the number of cells per linear inch. These often range from around 250 to upwards of 2000, though the precise numbers vary by manufacturer. Most rolls sold are within 800 LPI, although a spike in demand for those with 800‚Äì1200 lines has been seen. Anilox rolls are almost always designed to be removed from the press for cleaning and for swapping out with different line screen rolls. Anilox rolls are properly specified by cell volume for the required print application. Lower volumes = thinner ink films for the highest quality process printing. Higher volumes address combination, screens, line work, solid coverage and coating applications. In virtually all printing applications with various print requirements, one volume will not print all to the highest quality. Limited print stations generally call for a compromise between the highest quality graphics and color. There are many variables to consider when specifying an anilox roll beyond the print requirements, such as substrate, ink system, plate material, plate mounting tape, press speed, and drying capacity. The best course of action is to consult suppliers of all these components for proper engraving specifications from their experience. = Anilox roll specifications = There are two ways to specify anilox roll settings: on transfer volume or on line count. Each specification has both a European standard and an American standard.  Transfer volume  Transfer volume is the volume of ink that will be transferred per unit surface area of paper. The European standard for transfer volume is cm¬≥/m¬≤ or cubic centimetre per square meter, which means 1 cm¬≥ of ink will be transferred onto 1 M¬≤ of paper. Sometimes ink suppliers will give a recommended transfer weight per square meter, expressed in g/m¬≤. This can be converted to cm¬≥/m¬≤ by dividing by the density of the ink in g/cm¬≥. The American standard for transfer volume is a billion cubic microns per square inch, typically written as BCM / in¬≤, BCM/sq in, or BCM. A cubic micron (Œºm¬≥) is a unit of volume and one billion cubic microns (1 000 000 000 Œºm¬≥) is equal to 0.001 cm¬≥. Since one square meter is equal to 1550 square inches, it follows that _1 BCM/in¬≤ = 1.55 cm¬≥/m¬≤_.  Line count  Line count measures the finesse of the pattern on the anilox roll. It measures how many cells are engraved per centimetre or inch. In Europe the standard is LPCM or lines per centimetre. In America, the standard is LPI or lines per inch. The conversion from transfer volume to line count is not straightforward. This is because depending on the pattern used for the cell and depth of gravure of the anilox roll, the cell might contain higher or lower volumes of ink. The only way to convert cm¬≥/m¬≤ (transfer volume) to LPCM (cell finesse) or BCM to LPI is to look at the conversion chart provided by the anilox roll supplier. Also, any given anilox roll will age after some time and its actual transfer volume will be less and less. PCMC's Meridian laser anilox cleaner Handling and maintenance Though large wide-web flexo rolls are only maneuverable by overhead crane, on smaller presses anilox rolls are often handled directly by operators. Extreme caution must be taken when handling these pieces of hardware as a single bump against a hard surface or sharp corner can destroy the delicate cell structure on the surface and render a roller completely useless, at a cost of around 5000 for even small narrow-web rollers. Nicks and scratches add up quickly, so fine brushes (never brass brushes) are used for cleaning the anilox roll. Anilox rollers that are used with water, solvent and oil based inks, which dry when left sitting out and unagitated, must be cleaned immediately after use or a problem known as plugging occurs, where minuscule amounts of ink dry in the cells. This leaves tiny, but unacceptable, pinholes in anything printed from the roll in the future. Anilox rolls can also become damaged if a steel doctor blade breaks and begins to grind the anilox roll. This creates a defect in the print called a \\"score line\\" due to the scoring of the anilox.

Organization  Wikimedia Deutschland speed dating at Wikimania 2012 Usually advance registration is required for speed dating events. Men and women are rotated to meet each other over a series of short \\"dates\\" usually lasting from three to eight minutes depending on the organization running the event. At the end of each interval, the organizer rings a bell, clinks a glass, or blows a whistle to signal the participants to move on to the next date. At the end of the event participants submit to the organizers a list of who they would like to provide their contact information to. If there is a match, contact information is forwarded to both parties. Contact information cannot be traded during the initial meeting, in order to reduce pressure to accept or reject a suitor to his or her face. There are many speed dating events now in the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States. Requirement for each event vary with the organizer. Specific age range based on gender is a common restriction for events. Many speed dating events are targeted at particular communities. The documentary film, \\"Age of Love\\" describes a speed dating event organized for older adults. Other groups have included:Jaffe, I. \\"Seniors Speed Date in \\"Age of Love\\" Science, March 8, 2015. https://www.npr.org/2015/03/08/391619575/seniors-speed-date-in-age-of- love LGBT people, polyamorists, Christians. Graduate student speed dating events are common.  Practice  Some feel that speed dating has some obvious advantages over most other venues for meeting people, such as bars, discotheques, etc. in that everybody is purportedly there to meet someone, they are grouped into compatible age ranges, it is time-efficient, and the structured interaction eliminates the need to introduce oneself. Unlike many bars, a speed dating event will, by necessity, be quiet enough for people to talk comfortably. Participants can come alone without feeling out of place; alternatively it is something that women who like to go out in groups can do together. Because the matching itself happens after the event, people do not feel pressured to select or reject each other in person. On the other hand, feedback and gratification are delayed as participants must wait a day or two for their results to come in. The time limit ensures that a participant will not be stuck with a boorish match for very long, and prevents participants from monopolizing one another's time. On the other hand, a couple that decides they are incompatible early on will have to sit together for the duration of the round. Most speed dating events match people at random, and participants will meet different \\"types\\" that they might not normally talk to in a club. On the other hand, the random matching precludes the various cues, such as eye contact, that people use in bars to preselect each other before chatting them up. According to the New York Times, participants in speed dating experience an average of 2 in 10 or 3 in 10 matches. Online dating participants, in contrast, only find a compatible match with 1 in 100 or fewer of the profiles they study. As reported by the BBC in the Science of Love, it only takes between 90 seconds to 4 minutes of face-to-face interaction to determine attraction, which gives speed dating an advantage over online dating. Some speed dating companies have now started offering free speed dating where the user does not pay unless they meet somebody they like. History In the 19th century, in what was perhaps a precursor to modern speed dating, there was a custom in some areas of the United States called New Year's Calling. The custom was that on New Year's Day many young, single women would hold an Open House (a party or reception during which a person's home is open to visitors) on January 1st where they would invite eligible bachelors, both friends and strangers, to stop by for a brief (no more than 10-15 minute) visit. The earliest documented example of speed dating was by Aryeh (Alan) and Rena Hirsch of Los Angeles in early 1996 who developed speed dating as a solution to the problem of typical single events where \\"only attractive women and outgoing men have success at the end of the evening\\". SpeedDating, as a single word, is a registered trademark of Aish HaTorah, who began hosting such events in 1998.  Scientific research  There have been several studies of the round-robin dating systems themselves, as well as studies of interpersonal attraction that are relevant to these events. Other studies found speed-dating data useful as a way to observe individual choices among random participants. = First impressions = A 2005 study at the University of Pennsylvania of multiple HurryDate speed dating events found that most people made their choices within the first three seconds of meeting. Furthermore, issues such as religion, previous marriages, and smoking habits were found to play much less of a role than expected. \\"HurryDate: Mate preferences in action\\" ‚Äîa study done by evolutionary psychologists at the University of Pennsylvania \\"UPenn: Falling in Love in Three Minutes or Less\\" ‚Äîpress release A 2006 study in Edinburgh, Scotland showed that 45% of the women participants in a speed- dating event and 22% of the men had come to a decision within the first 30 seconds. It also found that dialogue concerning travel resulted in more matches than dialogue about films.\\"Men, you have 30 seconds to impress women\\"‚ÄîThe Scotsman Apr 14 2006 In a 2012 study, researchers found that activation of specific brain regions while viewing images of opposite-sex speed dating participants was predictive of whether or not a participant would later pursue or reject the viewed participants at an actual speed dating event. Men and women made decisions in a similar manner which incorporated the physical attractiveness and likability of the viewed participants in their evaluation. = Subconscious preferences = Malcolm Gladwell's book on split- second decision making, Blink, introduces two professors at Columbia University who run speed-dating events. Drs. Sheena Iyengar and Raymond Fisman found, from having the participants fill out questionnaires, that what people said they wanted in an ideal mate did not match their subconscious preferences. pp. 61-66 = Olfaction and the MHC = A 1995 study at the University of Bern showed that women appear to be attracted to the smell of men who have different MHC profiles from their own, and that oral contraceptives reversed this effect. The MHC is a region of the human genome involved with immune function. Because parents with more diverse MHC profiles would be expected to produce offspring with stronger immune systems, dissimilar MHC may play a role in sexual selection. A speed \\"date\\" lasting several minutes should be long enough for the MHC hypothesis to come into play, provided the participants are seated close enough together. = Olfaction and pheromones = The TV news magazine 20/20 once sent both a male and a female set of twins to a speed dating event. One of each set was wearing pheromones, and the ones wearing pheromones received more matches. = Age and height preference = A 2006 study by Mich√®le Belot and Marco Francesconi into the relative effects of preference versus opportunity in mate selection showed, while concluding that opportunity was more important than preference, that a woman's age is the single most important factor determining demand by men.Can anyone be the One? Evidence on Mate Selection from Speed Dating IZA Discussion paper October 2006 Although less important than it is to men, age is still a highly significant factor determining demand by women. The same study found that a man's height had a significant impact upon his desirability, with a reduction in height causing a decrease in desirability at the rate of 5% per inch. = Selectivity = Studies of speed dating events generally show more selectivity among women than among men. For instance, the Penn study reported that the average man was chosen by 34% of the women and the average woman was chosen by 49% of the men. New studies suggest that the selectivity is based on which gender is seated and which is rotating. This new study showed that when men were seated and the women rotated, the men were more selective.  Spin-offs  The popularity or charm of speed dating has led to at least one offspring: Speed Networking. A structured way of running business networking events with the goal of making meeting potential business contacts easier and more productive. Speed networking has also been used in China as a way for business people to meet each other and to decide if they have similar business objectives and synergies. Speed networking offers participating investors and companies an opportunity to have focused private meetings with targeted groups in a compact time frame.

Until October 1986 the paper's masthead over the editorial contained the words \\"incorporating the Freeman's Journal\\".

The term comes from the French , which literally means \\"gloves from Sweden\\".Suede, Dictionary.com Suede is made from the underside of the animal skin, which is softer and more pliable than, though not as durable as, the outer skin layer. Production Clarks Suede leather is made from the underside of the skin, primarily from lamb, although goat, calf and deer are commonly used. Splits from thick hides of cow and deer are also sueded, but, due to the fiber content, have a shaggy nap. Because suede does not include the tough exterior skin layer, suede is less durable but softer than standard (\\"full-grain\\") leather. Its softness, thinness, and pliability make it suitable for clothing and delicate uses; suede was originally used for women's gloves, hence its etymology (see above). Suede leather is also popular in upholstery, shoes, bags, and other accessories, and as a lining for other leather products. Due to its textured nature and open pores, suede may become dirty and quickly absorb liquids. Alternatives Fabrics are often manufactured with a brushed or napped finish to resemble suede leather. These products often provide a similar look and feel to suede, but have advantages such as increased liquid or stain resistance, and may appeal to consumers who prefer a non-animal product. Sueded silk, sueded cotton and similar sueded fabrics are brushed, sanded or chemically treated for extra softness. \\"Suede\\" yarns are generally thick and plush. Alcantara and Ultrasuede are trademarked names for a plush microfiber with a feel resembling soft suede, but more durable and resistant to liquids and stains.

Human ingenuity has led to various technological developments through applied science, and can also be seen in the development of new social organizations, institutions, and relationships. Ingenuity involves the most complex human thought processes, bringing together our thinking and acting both individually and collectively to take advantage of opportunities and/or overcome problems.  Application  One example of how ingenuity is used conceptually can be found in the analysis of Thomas Homer- Dixon, building on that of Paul Romer, to refer to what is usually called instructional capital. In this case, Homer-Dixon used the phrase 'ingenuity gap' denotes the space between a challenge and its solution. His particular contribution is to explore the social dimensions of ingenuity. Typically we think of ingenuity being used to build faster computers or more advanced medical treatments. Homer-Dixon argues that as the complexity of the world increases, our ability to solve the problems we face is becoming critical. Human ingenuity is also included in many school systems, with most teachers encouraging students to be educated in human ingenuity. These challenges require more than improvements arising from physics, chemistry and biology, as one will need to consider the highly complex interactions of individuals, institutions, cultures, and networks involving all of the human family around the globe. Organizing ourselves differently, communicating and making decisions in new ways, are examples of social ingenuity. If one's ability to generate adequate solutions to these problems is inadequate, the ingenuity gap will lead to a wide range of social problems. The full exploration of these ideas in meeting social challenges is featured in The Ingenuity Gap, one of Thomas Homer-Dixon's earliest books. In another of Homer-Dixon's books, The Up Side of Down, he argues that increasingly expensive oil, driven by scarcity, will lead to great social instability. Walking across an empty room requires very little ingenuity. If the room is full of snakes, hungry bears, and land mines, the ingenuity requirement will have gone up considerably.  Discussion/Argument  Ingenuity is often inherent in creative individuals, and thus is considered hard to separate from individual capital. It is not clear though if Dixon or Romer considered it impossible to do so, or if they were simply not familiar with the prior analysis of \\"applied ideas\\", \\"intellectual capital\\", \\"talent\\", or \\"innovation\\" where instructional and individual contributions have been carefully separated, by economic theorists.

The group was founded by Frank Farian in 1988 and consisted of Fab Morvan and Rob Pilatus. Their debut album, All or Nothing in Europe, reconfigured as Girl You Know It's True in the United States, achieved international success and brought them a Grammy Award for Best New Artist on 21 February 1990. They became one of the most popular pop acts in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with millions of records sold. However, their success turned to infamy when it was discovered that Morvan and Pilatus did not sing any of the vocals on their music releases. They ended up returning their Grammy Award for Best New Artist. They recorded a comeback album in 1998 titled Back and in Attack, but its release was cancelled after Rob Pilatus died at the age of 32. Beginnings, 1988‚Äì1989 Rob Pilatus met Fabrice Morvan during a dance seminar at a disco in Los Angeles. The two bonded over their similar experiences growing up in European cities, Paris (Morvan) and Munich (Pilatus). \\"Something clicked between us,\\" Pilatus said. \\"Maybe it's because we're both black people who grew up in foreign cities that don't have too many blacks.\\" They reunited in Munich, where they attempted to find work as backing singers, then formed their own act. After adopting the name Milli Vanilli, they recorded an album for a small German label that sold just a few thousand records. Although they were focused on becoming famous, they struggled with poverty. \\"We lived in a project. We had no money. We wanted to be stars,\\" explained Pilatus. Music producer Frank Farian learned of the duo and invited them to his Frankfurt studio to listen to a demo. \\"We got a call to come to his studio and we said, 'All right that's it,' \\" Pilatus recalled. \\"We were just dumb little kids, so we said, 'Let's go.' When we got to the studio, \\"Girl You Know It's True\\" was just a demo and he asked us our opinion of it and if we could sing it and we said, 'Yeah, we could sing it.' And he said, 'Oh beautiful, I believe it, but next week we have shows to do, so don't worry, I'll make you into a millionaire.'\\" Farian signed the duo to a contract on 1 January 1988, obligating him to record 10 songs a year. But the group's singing in the recording studio did not impress Farian. \\"These two guys came into the studio, they recorded, but they didn't have enough quality,\\" Farian said. The final mix of \\"Girl You Know It's True\\" was finished by studio performers‚Äîincluding Charles Shaw, John Davis, Brad Howell, Jodie Rocco and Linda Rocco‚Äîin March and April. By May, Pilatus and Morvan were touring Spain, France and Italy, lip-syncing to the pre-recorded tracks and thrilling crowds with their distinct style ‚Äî spandex shorts, thigh- high boots and cornrow hair extensions. According to Pilatus, \\"We would ask Frank, 'When are we going to be allowed to give some (artistic) input?', and he would say, 'Yeah, yeah, but right now we need you to go out and do promotion. Of course, you'll get to do it, just work with us.' That's how he strung us along.\\" After \\"Girl You Know It's True\\" took off in Germany in summer 1988, Farian produced and wrote most of the material on the album All or Nothing, which was released in Europe in November 1988. \\"After Frank released the album, he told us that it was too late to stop now,\\" Pilatus said. \\"Because the single was such a big success, he said, 'Now you have to go through with it. I'll cover you guys. Nobody will find out.' He said, 'Here, I'll give you $20,000 advance money.' We never had a hit before, so we went along with it. We played with fire and now we know, but it's too late.\\" By December, Pilatus and Morvan came to the realization that their actual voices would never be heard on any Milli Vanilli tracks. All or Nothing was repackaged as Girl You Know It's True for audiences in the United States and released in March 1989. It was a major success, producing five singles that entered the top five of the Billboard Hot 100, three of which (\\"Baby Don't Forget My Number\\", \\"Blame It on the Rain\\", and \\"Girl I'm Gonna Miss You\\") went to number one. On January 1990, Girl You Know It's True was certified 6√ó platinum by the RIAA after spending seven weeks atop the Billboard Top 200. It spent 41 weeks in the top 10 of the Billboard Top 200 and 78 weeks on the charts overall. It was also certified Diamond in Canada, denoting sales of over a million units there. The duo won a Grammy Award for Best New Artist. Lip-syncing exposure and media backlash, 1989‚Äì1991 Beth McCarthy-Miller, then an executive with MTV, says the duo's English language skills, when they came in for their first interview with the channel, stirred doubts among those present as to whether they had sung on their records. The first public sign that the group was lip-syncing came on 21 July 1989, during a live performance on MTV at the Lake Compounce theme park in Bristol, Connecticut. As they performed, a hard drive issue caused the recording of the song \\"Girl You Know It's True\\" to jam and skip, repeatedly playing the partial line \\"Girl, you know it's...\\" through the speakers. \\"I knew right then and there, it was the beginning of the end for Milli Vanilli,\\" recalled Pilatus of the incident. \\"When my voice got stuck in the computer, and it just kept repeating and repeating, I panicked. I didn't know what to do. I just ran off the stage.\\" Downtown Julie Brown ran after Pilatus and convinced him to finish the set. \\"With a bit of pushing and screaming, and a couple of F-words I think as well, I got them back out there,\\" Brown explained on VH1's Behind the Music. Despite the mishap, the concert audience seemed neither to care, nor even to notice, and the concert continued as if nothing unusual had happened. In a March 1990 issue of Time magazine, Pilatus was quoted proclaiming himself to be \\"the new Elvis\\", reasoning that by the duo's success they were more talented musically than Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney and Mick Jagger. This was denied by Fab Morvan, as recently as 2017, saying that Pilatus never used those words and that the quote was taken out of context, likely due to Pilatus still not having a full grasp of the English language. Unlike the international release of All or Nothing, the inserts for the American version of the album explicitly attributed the vocals to Morvan and Pilatus. This prompted singer Charles Shaw to reveal in December 1989 that he was one of the three actual vocalists on the album and that Pilatus and Morvan were impostors. Farian reportedly paid Shaw $150,000 to retract his statements, though this did not stem the tide of public criticism. Because of growing public questions as to who sang in the group, as well as Morvan and Pilatus' demand to Farian that they be allowed to sing on the next album, on 14 November 1990, Farian announced that he had fired them and confessed they did not sing on the records. Confronted by Los Angeles Times reporter Chuck Philips, Pilatus confirmed the deception. \\"It‚Äôs True: Milli Vanilli Didn‚Äôt Sing\\" read the newspaper's headline. \\"I feel like a mosquito being squeezed,\\" Pilatus said. \\"The last two years of our lives have been a total nightmare. We've had to lie to everybody. We are true singers, but that maniac Frank Farian would never allow us to express ourselves.\\" The next week, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences revoked Milli Vanilli's 1990 Grammy for Best New Artist. Pilatus and Morvan gave a press conference for more than 100 journalists in Los Angeles where they stated their willingness to return their Grammy Award. The duo said they had \\"made a deal with the devil,\\" and they sang and rapped for the room in order to prove that, although they hadn't sung on their records, they could, in fact, sing. After these details emerged, lawsuits were filed under various U.S. consumer fraud protection laws against Arista Records, Pilatus and Morvan. One such filing occurred on 22 November 1990, in Ohio, where lawyers filed a class- action lawsuit asking for refunds on behalf of a local woman in Cuyahoga County who had bought Girl You Know It's True. When the suit was filed, it was estimated at least 1,000 Ohio residents had bought the album. On 12 August 1991, a proposed settlement of a refund lawsuit in Chicago, Illinois, was rejected. This settlement would have refunded buyers of Milli Vanilli CDs, cassettes, records and singles. However, the refunds would only be given as credits for future Arista releases. On 28 August, a new settlement was approved; it refunded those who attended concerts as well as those who bought Milli Vanilli recordings. An estimated 10 million buyers were eligible to claim a refund, and they could keep the refunded recordings. The refund deadline passed on 8 March 1992. Adding to the controversy, in December 1990 singer-songwriter David Clayton-Thomas sued Milli Vanilli for copyright infringement, alleging that the title song of All or Nothing used the melody from his 1968 composition \\"Spinning Wheel\\", a hit for his group Blood, Sweat & Tears. The Real Milli Vanilli, 1991‚Äì1992 The resulting album, released in Europe in early 1991, was renamed The Moment of Truth and spawned three singles, \\"Keep On Running\\", \\"Nice 'n Easy\\" and \\"Too Late (True Love)\\". A Morvan/Pilatus lookalike named Ray Horton was depicted on the cover along with the real singers: Brad Howell and John Davis. In addition, the album featured rappers Icy Bro on \\"Hard as Hell\\" and Tammy T on \\"Too Late (True Love)\\". Original members and vocalists Jodie Rocco and Linda Rocco remained on 95% of the tracks. One of four Diane Warren-penned songs that are included on The Moment of Truth, \\"When I Die\\", has been covered by several other artists, including Farian's No Mercy. For the American market, Farian chose to avoid any association with Milli Vanilli and had the tracks re-recorded with Ray Horton on the majority of lead vocals. However, The Moment of Truth was never released in that format in the USA.  * =Try 'N' B= In 1992, RCA signed on to release the album as the debut of the newly created group Try 'N' B. The self-titled release included three additional tracks not on the Real Milli Vanilli release: \\"Ding Dong\\", \\"Who Do You Love\\", and a remake of Dr. Hook's \\"Sexy Eyes\\", and featured original Milli Vanilli vocalists Jodie Rocco and Linda Rocco. Because of significantly better sales under the name Try 'N' B in America, a slightly modified Try 'N' B debut album was released internationally. It featured guest singer Tracy Ganser, a Ray Horton lookalike named Kevin Weatherspoon, as well as Jodie Rocco and Linda Rocco. Rob & Fab, 1990‚Äì1993 Morvan and Pilatus moved to Los Angeles, California, and signed with the Joss Entertainment Group. Sandy Gallin was their manager.Hollywood agent and producer Sandy Gallin dead at 76 The Associated Press, 22 April 2017 They recorded the album Rob & Fab, which was financed by Taj Records in 1992 and released by Joss Entertainment in 1993. Almost all the album's songs were written by Kenny Taylor and Fab Morvan, while Morvan and Pilatus provided the lead vocals. Werner Sch√ºler, a German bassist and songwriter, was the producer.Milli Vanilli: Fr to Shame IMDb, 60min documentary, 23 July 2016 Due to financial constraints, Joss Entertainment Group was able to release the album only in the United States, the priority market to Milli Vanilli. A single, \\"We Can Get It On\\", was made available for radio play shortly before the album's release. However, the lack of publicity, poor distribution, and their steep fall from the height of pop-culture visibility after the lip- synching scandal contributed to its failure. It sold only around 2,000 copies. Comeback attempt and death of Rob Pilatus, 1997‚Äì1998 To restore their careers, Farian agreed to produce a new Milli Vanilli album with Morvan and Pilatus on lead vocals in 1997, leading to the recording of the 1998 Milli Vanilli comeback album Back and In Attack. Some of the original studio singers even backed the duo in their attempt to recover some of their fame that had been lost so quickly. However, Rob Pilatus encountered a number of personal problems during the album's production. He turned to drugs and crime, committing a series of assaults and robberies, and was sentenced to three months in jail and six months in a drug rehabilitation facility in California. Farian bailed Pilatus out of jail. On the eve of the new album's promotional tour on 2 April 1998, Pilatus was found dead of a suspected alcohol and prescription drug overdose in a hotel room in Frankfurt, Germany. His death was ruled accidental. Fab Morvan's solo career Morvan spent the following years as a session musician and public speaker while working on writing and performing his new music. In 1998, he was a DJ at famed L.A. radio station KIIS-FM. During this period he also performed at the station's sold-out 1999 Wango Tango festival concert before 50,000 people at Dodger Stadium. He then spent 2001 on tour before performing in 2002 as the inaugural performer at the brand-new Velvet Lounge at the Hard Rock Hotel in Orlando, Florida. In 2003, Morvan released his first solo album, Love Revolution,. In April 2011, Morvan released the single \\"Anytime\\" on iTunes. Later developments In 1991, Pilatus and Morvan appeared in a commercial for Carefree Sugarless Gum that parodied their lip-syncing fiasco. They portrayed animated versions of themselves in an episode of The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3 and even signed with a PR firm in hopes of breaking into acting. As they told the L.A. Times, \\"We think we have the potential to become actors. After all, we got a lot of practice while we were in Milli Vanilli. But the most important thing to us now is the new album.\\" The duo was featured and interviewed for the premiere episode of VH1 Behind the Music in 1997. In 2000, Fab Morvan was featured in the BBC documentary It Takes Two: The Story of the Pop Duo about musical duos. On 14 February 2007, it was announced that Universal Pictures was developing a film based on the story of Milli Vanilli's rise and fall. Jeff Nathanson, screenwriter for Catch Me If You Can, producers Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall, and producer executive Adam Yoelin were signed to write and direct the film, while Fab Morvan served as a consultant. However, in February 2011, it was announced the Milli Vanilli movie would be rewritten and directed by Florian Gallenberger. In January 2014, the actual Milli Vanilli singers‚ÄîJodie Rocco, Linda Rocco, John Davis and Brad Howell‚Äîfilmed an in-depth interview with the producers of Oprah: Where Are They Now for OWN TV. In 2015 TMZ reported that Fab Morvan was working on an album with John Davis, one of the original Milli Vanilli singers, called Face Meets Voice. The documentary \\"Milli Vanilli: From Fame to Shame\\", directed by German Oliver Schwehm and produced by Hannah Lenitzki from Bremedia Produktion, was released in 2016.Milli Vanilli: From Fame to Shame IMDb, 1h documentary, 23 July 2016 Discography=Studio albums= *All or Nothing (1988) *Girl You Know It's True (1989) *The Moment of Truth (1991) (as The Real Milli Vanilli) ReferencesExternal links *MTV Artist Arena: Milli Vanilli *Allmusic entry for Milli Vanilli ;Individual artists involved *Fabrice Morvan's official website *John Davis' official website *The Real Milli Vanilli's official website *Frank Farian's Website *Breaking stories about Milli Vanilli's Rob Pilatus and Fab Morvan by Chuck Philips archived at the LA Times Category:1988 establishments in Germany Category:1998 disestablishments in Germany Category:1980s hoaxes Category:1990s hoaxes Category:Arista Records artists Category:Controversies in Germany Category:Entertainment scandals Category:German dance music groups Category:German musical duos Category:German pop music groups Category:Hansa Records artists Category:Music controversies Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1998 Category:Musical groups established in 1988 Category:Musical hoaxes ","title":"Milli Vanilli"},{"id":"169552","text":"In physics, there are four observed fundamental forces or interactions that form the basis of all known interactions in nature: gravitational, electromagnetic, strong nuclear, and weak nuclear forces. Some speculative theories have proposed a fifth force to explain various anomalous observations that do not fit existing theories. The characteristics of this fifth force depend on the hypothesis being advanced. Many postulate a force roughly the strength of gravity (i.e., it is much weaker than electromagnetism or the nuclear forces) with a range of anywhere from less than a millimeter to cosmological scales. Another proposal is a new weak force mediated by W‚Ä≤ and Z‚Ä≤ bosons. The search for a fifth force has increased in recent decades due to two discoveries in cosmology which are not explained by current theories. It has been discovered that most of the mass of the universe is accounted for by an unknown form of matter called dark matter. Most physicists believe that dark matter consists of new, undiscovered subatomic particles, but some believe that it could be related to an unknown fundamental force. Second, it has also recently been discovered that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, which has been attributed to a form of energy called dark energy. Some physicists speculate that a form of dark energy called quintessence could be a fifth force. Experimental approaches A new fundamental force might be difficult to test. Gravity, for example, is such a weak force that the gravitational interaction between two objects is only significant when one of them has a great mass. Therefore, it takes very sensitive equipment to measure gravitational interactions between objects that are small compared to the Earth. A new (or \\"fifth\\") fundamental force might similarly be weak and therefore difficult to detect. Nonetheless, in the late 1980s a fifth force, operating on municipal scales (i.e. with a range of about 100 meters), was reported by researchers (Fischbach et al.) who were reanalyzing results of Lor√°nd E√∂tv√∂s from earlier in the century. The force was believed to be linked with hypercharge. Over a number of years, other experiments have failed to duplicate this result. ‚Äì the leading group searching for a fifth force. There are at least three kinds of searches that can be undertaken, which depend on the kind of force being considered, and its range. =Equivalence principle= One way to search for a fifth force is with tests of the strong equivalence principle: this is one of the most powerful tests of Einstein's theory of gravity: general relativity. Alternative theories of gravity, such as Brans‚ÄìDicke theory, have a fifth force ‚Äì possibly with infinite range. This is because gravitational interactions, in theories other than general relativity, have degrees of freedom other than the \\"metric\\", which dictates the curvature of space, and different kinds of degrees of freedom produce different effects. For example, a scalar field cannot produce the bending of light rays. The fifth force would manifest itself in an effect on solar system orbits, called the Nordtvedt effect. This is tested with Lunar Laser Ranging experiment and very-long-baseline interferometry. =Extra dimensions= Another kind of fifth force, which arises in Kaluza‚ÄìKlein theory, where the universe has extra dimensions, or in supergravity or string theory is the Yukawa force, which is transmitted by a light scalar field (i.e. a scalar field with a long Compton wavelength, which determines the range). This has prompted a lot of recent interest, as a theory of supersymmetric large extra dimensions ‚Äì dimensions with size slightly less than a millimeter ‚Äì has prompted an experimental effort to test gravity on these very small scales. This requires extremely sensitive experiments which search for a deviation from the inverse-square law of gravity over a range of distances., which is set to test for a fifth force in space, where it is possible to achieve greater sensitivity. Essentially, they are looking for signs that the Yukawa interaction is kicking in at a certain length. Australian researchers, attempting to measure the gravitational constant deep in a mine shaft, found a discrepancy between the predicted and measured value, with the measured value being two percent too small. They concluded that the results may be explained by a repulsive fifth force with a range from a few centimetres to a kilometre. Similar experiments have been carried out on board a submarine, USS Dolphin (AGSS-555), while deeply submerged. A further experiment measuring the gravitational constant in a deep borehole in the Greenland ice sheet found discrepancies of a few percent, but it was not possible to eliminate a geological source for the observed signal. =Earth's mantle= Another experiment uses the Earth's mantle as a giant particle detector, focusing on geoelectrons. =Cepheid variables= Jain et al. (2012) examined existing data on the rate of pulsation of over a thousand cepheid variable stars in 25 galaxies. Theory suggests that the rate of cepheid pulsation in galaxies screened from a hypothetical fifth force by neighbouring clusters, would follow a different pattern from cepheids that are not screened. They were unable to find any variation from Einstein's theory of gravity. =Other approaches= Some experiments used a lake plus a tower that is high. A comprehensive review by Ephraim Fischbach and Carrick Talmadge suggested there is no compelling evidence for the fifth force, though scientists still search for it. The Fischbach-Talmadge article was written in 1992, and since then, other evidence has come to light that may indicate a fifth force. The above experiments search for a fifth force that is, like gravity, independent of the composition of an object, so all objects experience the force in proportion to their masses. Forces that depend on the composition of an object can be very sensitively tested by torsion balance experiments of a type invented by Lor√°nd E√∂tv√∂s. Such forces may depend, for example, on the ratio of protons to neutrons in an atomic nucleus, nuclear spin, or the relative amount of different kinds of binding energy in a nucleus (see the semi-empirical mass formula). Searches have been done from very short ranges, to municipal scales, to the scale of the Earth, the Sun, and dark matter at the center of the galaxy. Modified gravity Also known as non- local gravity. A few physicists think that Einstein's theory of gravity will have to be modified ‚Äì not at small scales, but at large distances, or equivalently, at small accelerations. This would change the gravity force to a non-local force. They point out that dark matter and dark energy are unexplained by the Standard Model of particle physics and suggest that some modification of gravity is necessary, possibly arising from modified Newtonian dynamics or the holographic principle. This is fundamentally different from conventional ideas of a fifth force, as it grows stronger relative to gravity at longer distances. Most physicists, however, think that dark matter and dark energy are not ad hoc, but are supported by a large number of complementary observations and described by a very simple model. Possible evidence In 2015, Attila Krasznahorkay at ATOMKI, the Hungarian Academy of Sciences's Institute for Nuclear Research in Debrecen, Hungary, and his colleagues posited the existence of a new, light boson (17 MeV) only 34 times heavier than the electron. In an effort to find a dark photon, the Hungarian team fired protons at thin targets of lithium-7, which created unstable beryllium-8 nuclei that then decayed and spat out pairs of electrons and positrons. Excess decays were observed at an opening angle of 140¬∞ between the e+ and e‚àí, and a combined energy of 17 MeV, which indicated that a small fraction of beryllium-8 will shed excess energy in the form of a new particle. Jonathan Feng et al. (2016) proposed that a protophobic (i.e. \\"proton-ignoring\\") X-boson with a mass of 16.7 MeV with suppressed couplings to protons relative to neutrons and electrons and femtometer range could explain the data. The force may explain the g‚àí2 muon anomaly and provide a dark matter candidate. Several research experiments are underway to attempt to validate or refute these results. In November 2019, Krasznahorkay announced that he and his team at ATOMKI had successfully observed the same anomalies in the decay of stable helium atoms as had been observed in beryllium-8, strengthening the case for the X17 particle's existence. This was reported through science journalism, focusing largely on the implications that the existence of the X17 particle and a corresponding fifth force would have in the search for dark matter. Speaking to The Independent, Krasznahorkay said \\"if the particle‚Äôs existence is confirmed, it means physicists will have to finally reassess the interactions of the existing four fundamental forces of particle physics and make space for a fifth.\\" See alsoReferences Category:Interaction Category:Force ","title":"Fifth force"},{"id":"169553","text":"Since the 2010s, Internet dating has become more popular with smartphones. Online dating (or Internet dating) is a system that enables people to find and introduce themselves to potential connections over the Internet, usually with the goal of developing personal, romantic, or sexual relationships. An online dating service is a company that provides specific mechanisms (generally websites or software applications) for online dating through the use of Internet-connected personal computers or mobile devices. Such companies offer a wide variety of unmoderated matchmaking services, most of which are profile- based. Online dating services allow users to become \\"members\\" by creating a profile and uploading personal information including (but not limited to) age, gender, sexual orientation, location, and appearance. Most services also encourage members to add photos or videos to their profile. Once a profile has been created, members can view the profiles of other members of the service, using the visible profile information to decide whether or not to initiate contact. Most services offer digital messaging, while others provide additional services such as webcasts, online chat, telephone chat (VOIP), and message boards. Members can constrain their interactions to the online space, or they can arrange a date to meet in person. A great diversity of online dating services currently exists. (See comparison of online dating services.) Some have a broad membership base of diverse users looking for many different types of relationships. Other sites target highly specific demographics based on features like shared interests, location, religion, sexual orientation or relationship type. Online dating services also differ widely in their revenue streams. Some sites are completely free and depend on advertising for revenue. Others utilize the freemium revenue model, offering free registration and use, with optional, paid, premium services. Still others rely solely on paid membership subscriptions.  Matching algorithms  In 2012, social psychologists Benjamin Karney, Harry Reis, and others published an analysis of online dating in Psychological Science in the Public Interest that concluded that the matching algorithms of online dating services are only negligibly better at matching people than if they were matched at random. In 2014, Kang Zhao at the University of Iowa constructed a new approach based on the algorithms used by Amazon and Netflix, based on recommendations rather than the autobiographical notes of match seekers. Users' activities reflect their tastes and attractiveness, or the lack thereof, they reasoned. This algorithm increases the chances of a response by 40%, the researchers found. E-commerce firms also employ this \\"collaborative filtering\\" technique. Nevertheless, it is still not known what the algorithm for finding the perfect match would be. However, while collaborative filtering and recommender systems have been demonstrated to be more effective than matching systems based on similarity and complementarity, they have also been demonstrated to be highly skewed to the preferences of early users and against racial minorities such as African Americans and Hispanic Americans which led to the rise of niche dating sites for those groups. In 2014, the Better Business Bureau's National Advertising Division criticized eHarmony's claims of creating a greater number of marriages and more durable and satisfying marriages than alternative dating websites, and in 2018, the Advertising Standards Authority banned eHarmony advertisements in the United Kingdom after the company was unable to provide any evidence to verify its advertisements' claims that its website's matching algorithm was scientifically proven to give its users a greater chance of finding long-term intimate relationships.  Trends = Social trends and public opinions = Opinions and usage of online dating services also differ widely. A 2005 study of data collected by the Pew Internet & American Life Project found that individuals are more likely to use an online dating service if they use the Internet for a greater number of tasks, and less likely to use such a service if they are trusting of others. It is possible that the mode of online dating resonates with some participants' conceptual orientation towards the process of finding a romantic partner. That is, online dating sites use the conceptual framework of a \\"marketplace metaphor\\" to help people find potential matches, with layouts and functionalities that make it easy to quickly browse and select profiles in a manner similar to how one might browse an online store. Under this metaphor, members of a given service can both \\"shop\\" for potential relationship partners and \\"sell\\" themselves in hopes of finding a successful match. Attitudes towards online dating improved visibly between 2005 and 2015, the Pew Research Center found. In particular, the number of people who thought that online dating was a good way to meet people rose from 44% in 2005 to 59% in 2015 whereas those who believed that people to used online dating services were desperate fell from 29% to 23% during the same period. Although only a negligible number of people dated online in 2005, that rose to 11% in 2013 and then 15% in 2015. In particular, the number of American adults who had used an online dating site went from 9% in 2013 to 12% in 2015 while those who used an online dating software application on their mobile phones jumped from 3% to 9% during the same period. This increase was driven mainly by people aged 18 to 24, for whom usage almost tripled. At the same time, usage among those between the ages of 55 and 64 doubled. People in their mid-30s to mid-50s all saw noticeable increases in usage, but people aged 25 to 34 saw no change. Nevertheless, only one in three had actually gone out on a date with someone they met online. About one in five, especially women, at 30%, compared to 16% for men, asked for help with their online profile. Only five out of a hundred said they were married to or in a committed long-term relationship with someone they met online. For comparison, 88% of Americans who were with their current spouse or partner for no more than five years said their met their mates offline. Online daters may have more liberal social attitudes compared to the general population in the United States. According to a 2015 study by the Pew Research Center, people who had used online dating services had a higher opinion of such services than those who had not. 80% of the users said that online dating sites are a good way to meet potential partners, compared to 55% of non-users. In addition, online daters felt that online dating is easier more efficient than other methods (61%), and gives access to a larger pool of potential partners (62%), compared to 44% and 50% of non-users, respectively. Meanwhile, 60% of non-users thought that online dating was a more dangerous way of meeting people and 24% deemed people who dated online were desperate, compared to 45% and 16% of online daters, respectively. Nevertheless, a similar number of online daters (31%) and non-users (32%) agreed that online dating kept people from settling down. In all, there was little difference among the sexes with regards to their opinions on online dating. Safety was, however, the exception, with 53% of women and only 38% of men expressing concern. It is not clear that social networking websites and online dating services are leading to the formation of long-term intimate relationships more efficiently. In 2000, a majority of U.S. households had personal computers, and in 2001, a majority of U.S. households had internet access. In 1995, Match.com was created, followed by eHarmony in 2000, Myspace and Plenty of Fish in 2003, Facebook and OkCupid in 2004, Zoosk in 2007, and Tinder in 2012. In 2011, the percentage of all U.S. adults who were married declined to a historic low at 51 percent, while from 2007 to 2017 the percentage of U.S. adults living without spouses or partners rose to 42 percent (including 61 percent of adults under the age of 35) because declines in marriage since 1960 (when 72 percent of U.S. adults were married) have not been offset by increases in cohabitation. In 2014, the percentage of U.S. adults above the age of 25 who had never married rose to a record one-fifth (with the rate of growth in the category accelerating since 2000). Additionally, in 1989, social psychologist Douglas T. Kenrick demonstrated experimentally that following exposure to photographs or stories about desirable potential mates, human subjects decrease their ratings of commitment to their current partners, while social psychologist David Buss has estimated that approximately 30 percent of the men on Tinder are married, and a significant criticism of Facebook has been its effect on its users' marriages. = Mate preferences and mating strategies = Online dating services offer goldmines of information for social scientists studying human mating behavior. Data from the Chinese online dating giant Zhenai.com reveals that while men are most interested in how a woman looks, women care more about a man's income. Profession is also quite important. Chinese men favor women working as primary school teachers and nurses while Chinese women prefer men in the IT or finance industry. Women in IT or finance are the least desired. Zhenai enables users to send each other digital \\"winks.\\" For a man, the more money he earns the more \\"winks\\" he receives. For a woman, her income does not matter until the 50,000-yuan mark (US$7,135), after which the number of \\"winks\\" falls slightly. Men typically prefer women three years younger than they are whereas women look for men who are three years older on average. However, this changes if the man becomes exceptionally wealthy; the more money he makes the more likely he is to look for younger women. In general, people in their 20s employ the \\"self-service dating service\\" while women in their late 20s and up tend to use the matchmaking service. This is because of the social pressure in China on \\"leftover women,\\" meaning those in their late 20s but still not married. Women who prefer not to ask potentially embarrassing questions ‚Äì such as whether both spouses will handle household finances, whether or not they will live with his parents, or how many children he wants to have, if any ‚Äì will get a matchmaker to do it for them. Both sexes prefer matchmakers who are women. In a 2009 paper, sociologist George Yancey from the University of North Texas observed that prior research from the late 1980s to the early 2000s revealed that African-Americans were the least desired romantic partners compared to all other racial groups in the United States, a fact that is reflected in their relatively low interracial marriage rates. (They were also less likely to form interracial friendships than other groups.) According to data from the U.S. Census, 5.4% of all marriages in the U.S. in 2005 were between people of different races. For his research, Yancey downloaded anonymized data of almost a thousand heterosexual individuals from Yahoo! Personals. He discovered that Internet daters felt lukewarm towards racial exogamy in general. In particular, 45.8% of whites, 32.6% of blacks, 47.6% of Hispanics, and 64.4% of Asians were willing to out-date with any other racial group. Dating members of one's own racial group was the most popular option, at 98.0% for whites, 92.1% for blacks, 93.2% for Hispanics, and 92.2% for Asians. Those who were more willing to out-date than average tended to be younger men. Education was not a predictor of willingness to out-date. This means that the higher interracial marriage rates among the highly educated were due to the fact that higher education provided more opportunities to meet people of different races. There is, however, great variation along gender lines. In 2008, Cynthia Feliciano, Belinda Robnett, and Golnaz Komaie from the University of California, Irvine, investigated the preferences of online daters long gendered and racial lines by selecting profiles on Yahoo! Personals ‚Äì then one of the top Internet romance sites in the U.S.‚Äì of 6,070 heterosexual individuals, 1558 of whom white, between the ages of 18 and 50 living within 50 miles (80 km) of New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Atlanta. They found that consistent with prior research, including speed- dating studies, women tended to be pickier than men. In fact, while 29% of white men wanted to date only white women, 64% of white women were willing to date white men only. Of those who stated a racial preference, 97% of white men excluded black women, 48% Latinas, and 53% Asian women. In contrast, white men are excluded by 76% of black women, 33% Latinas, and only 11% Asian women. Similarly, 92% of white women exclude black men, 77% exclude Latinos, and 93% exclude Asian men. 71% of black men, 31% of Latinos, and 36% of Asian men excluded white women. In short, after opposite-sex members of their own group, white men were open to dating Asian women, and white women black men than members of other racial or ethnic groups. At the same time, Latinos were generally favored by both white men and women willing to out-date. Feliciano, Robnett, and Komaie found that white women who described themselves as athletic, average, fit, or slim were more likely to exclude black men than those who considered themselves large, thick, or voluptuous. Body type, however, was not a predictor for white women's avoidance of Asian men, nor was it for the white men's preferences. On the other hand, white men with a particular body type in mind were considerably more likely to exclude black women while women who preferred a particular height were slightly more likely to exclude Asian men. Women who deemed themselves very liberal or liberal were less likely than apolitical, moderate, or conservative women to exclude black men. In contrast, left-leaning white women were slightly more likely to exclude Asian men. Being Jewish was the perfect predictor of black exclusion. All white men and women who identified as Jewish and who had a racial preference excluded blacks, and all white Jewish women also avoided Asian men. White men with a religious preference were four times as likely to exclude black women, and white women with the same were twice as likely to exclude black men. However, religious preferences were not linked to avoiding Asians. Prior research has shown that in the absence of direct personal contact, one's perception of members of a different group is often shaped by stereotypes, or \\"cognitive structures that contain the perceiver‚Äôs knowledge, beliefs, and expectancies about some human group,\\" which are typically reinforced by mass media. Feliciano, Robnett, and Komaie found some support for this. In particular, white men's exclusion of black women was linked to the perception that black women deviate from (Western) idealized notions of femininity, for example by being bossy, while their favoring Asian women was likely due to the latter's portrayal in the media as \\"the embodiment of perfect womanhood\\" and \\"good wives.\\" On the other hand, white women's exclusion of Asian men correlated with the stereotype that the latter were asexual or lacked masculinity whereas their preferring black men corresponded with the latter's positive portrayal in the media as \\"independent and respected.\\" Feliciano, Robnett, and Komaie observed that their findings on mate preferences mirrored actual cohabitation and marriage patterns. In a separate paper from 2011 analyzing the same data set, Cynthia Feliciano and Belinda Robnett found in general, gender was a predictor of openness to dating outside of one's racial or ethnic group, with 74% of women and 58% of men stating a racial preference, though there was considerable variation among each. Latinos were quite open to out-dating, with only 15% of men and 16% of women preferring to date only other Latinos. 45% of black women and 23% of black men would rather not date non-blacks. 6% of Asian women and 21% of Asian men decided against out-dating. In addition, 4% of white women, 8% of black women, 16% of Latino women, and 40% of Asian women wanted to date only outside of their respective race or ethnicity. Therefore, all groups except white women were willing to out-date, albeit with great variations. 55% of Latino men excluded Asian women while 73% of Asian women excluded Latino men. An overwhelming majority of Asians, 94%, excluded blacks. By contrast, 81% of Latinos and 76% of Latinas avoided the same. For blacks willing to out-date, Latinos were most preferred. In 2018, Elizabeth Bruch and M.E.J. Newman from the University of Michigan published in the journal Science Advances a study of approximately 200,000 heterosexual individuals living in New York City, Chicago, Boston and Seattle, who used a certain \\"popular, free online-dating service.\\" The researchers were able to discern some general trends in the overall desirability of a given individual. For a man, his desirability increased till the age of 50; for a woman, her desirability declined steeply after the age of 18 till the age of 65. In terms of educational attainment, the more educated a man was, the more desirable he became; for a woman, however, her desirability rose up to the bachelor's degree before declining. Bruch suggested that besides individual preferences and partner availability, this pattern may be due to the fact that by the late 2010s, women were more likely to attend and graduate from university. In order to estimate the desirability of a given individual, the researchers looked at the number of messages they received and the desirability of the senders. Developmental psychologist Michelle Drouin, who was not involved in the study, told The New York Times this finding is in accordance with theories in psychology and sociology based on biological evolution in that youth is a sign of fertility. She added that women with advanced degrees are often viewed as more focused on their careers than family. Licensed psychotherapist Stacy Kaiser told MarketWatch men typically prefer younger women because \\"they are more easy to impress; they are more (moldable) in terms of everything from emotional behavior to what type of restaurant to eat at,\\" and because they tend to be \\"more fit, have less expectations and less baggage.\\" On the other hand, women look for (financial) stability and education, attributes that come with age, said Kaiser. These findings regarding age and attractiveness are consistent with earlier research by the online dating services OKCupid and Zoosk. In an 2010 blog post, OKCupid observed that, \\"The median 30-year-old man spends as much time messaging teenage girls as he does women his own age.\\" By analyzing data from between 2013 and 2017, OKCupid discovered that 61% what they called \\"successful\\" conversations, or those with \\"at least at four messages back and forth with contact exchange\\" took place between a man who was older than the woman. In half of these, the man was at least five years older. 2018 data from Zoosk revealed that 60% of men desired younger women, while 56% of younger women felt attracted to older men. Aided by the text- analysis program Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, Bruch and Newman discovered that men generally had lower chances of receiving a response after sending more \\"positively worded\\" messages. When a man tried to woo a woman more desirable than he was, he received a response 21% of the time; by contrast, when a woman attempted to court a man, she received a reply about half the time. In fact, over 80% of the first messages in the data set obtained for the purposes of the study were from men, and women were highly selective in choosing whom to respond to, a rate of less than 20%. Therefore, studying women's replies yielded much insight into their preferences. Bruch and Newman were also able to establish the existence of dating 'leagues'. Generally speaking, people were able to accurately estimate where they ranked on the dating hierarchy. Very few responded to the messages of people less desirable than they were. Nevertheless, although the probability of a response is low, it is well above zero, and if the other person does respond, it can a self-esteem booster, said Kaiser. Co-author of the study Mark Newman told BBC News, \\"There is a trade-off between how far up the ladder you want to reach and how low a reply rate you are willing to put up with.\\" Bruch and Newman found that while people spent a lot of time crafting lengthy messages to those they considered to be a highly desirable partner, this hardly made a difference, judging by the response rate. Keeping messages concise is well- advised. Previous studies also suggest that about 70% of the dating profile should be about oneself and the rest about the desired partner. At least three quarters of the sample surveyed attempted to date aspirationally, meaning they tried to initiate a relationship with someone who was more desirable, 25% more desirable, to be exact. Bruch recommended sending out more greeting messages, noting that people sometimes managed to upgrade their 'league'. Michael Rosenfeld, a sociologist not involved with the study, told The Atlantic, \\"The idea that persistence pays off makes sense to me, as the online-dating world has a wider choice set of potential mates to choose from. The greater choice set pays dividends to people who are willing to be persistent in trying to find a mate.\\" Using optimal stopping theory, one can show that the best way to select the best potential partner is to reject the first 37%, then pick the one who is better than the previous set. The probability of picking the best potential mate this way is 37%. (This is approximately the reciprocal of Euler's number, e = \\\\lim_{x \\\\rightarrow 0} (1 + x)^{1/x} \\\\approx 2.718281828. See derivation of the optimal policy.) However, making online contact is only the first step, and indeed, most conversations failed to birth a relationship. As two potential partners interact more and more, the superficial information available from a dating website or smartphone application becomes less important than their characters. Bruch and Newman found that overall, white men and Asian women were the most desired in all the four cities. Despite being a platform designed to be less centered on physical appearance, OkCupid co-founder Christian Rudder stated in 2009 that the male OkCupid users who were rated most physically attractive by female OkCupid users received 11 times as many messages as the lowest-rated male users did, the medium-rated male users received about four times as many messages, and the one-third of female users who were rated most physically attractive by the male users received about two-thirds of all messages sent by male users. Data released by Tinder has shown that of the 1.6 billion swipes it records per day, only 26 million result in matches (a match rate of approximately only 1.63%), despite users logging into the app on average 11 times per day, with male user sessions averaging 7.2 minutes and female user sessions averaging 8.5 minutes (or 79.2 minutes and 93.5 minutes per day respectively). Also, a Tinder user interviewed anonymously in an article published in the December 2018 issue of The Atlantic estimated that only one in 10 of their matches actually resulted in an exchange of messages with the other user they were matched with, with another anonymous Tinder user saying, \\"Getting right-swiped is a good ego boost even if I have no intention of meeting someone.\\" According to University of Texas at Austin psychologist David Buss, \\"Apps like Tinder and OkCupid give people the impression that there are thousands or millions of potential mates out there. One dimension of this is the impact it has on men's psychology. When there is ... a perceived surplus of women, the whole mating system tends to shift towards short-term dating,\\" and there is a feeling of disconnect when choosing future partners. In addition, the cognitive process identified by psychologist Barry Schwartz as the \\"paradox of choice\\" (also referred to as \\"choice overload\\" or \\"fear of a better option\\") was cited in an article published in The Atlantic that suggested that the appearance of an abundance of potential partners causes online daters to be less likely to choose a partner and be less satisfied with their choices of partners. Before 2012, most online dating services matched people according to their autobiographical information, such as interests, hobbies, future plans, among other things. But the advent of Tinder that year meant that first impressions could play a crucial role. For social scientists studying human courtship behavior, Tinder offers a much simpler environment than its predecessors. In 2016, Gareth Tyson of the Queen Mary University of London and his colleagues published a paper analyzing the behavior of Tinder users in New York City and London. In order to minimize the number of variables, they created profiles of white heterosexual people only. For each sex, there were three accounts using stock photographs, two with actual photographs of volunteers, one with no photos whatsoever, and one that was apparently deactivated. The researchers pointedly only used pictures of people of average physical attractiveness. Tyson and his team wrote an algorithm that collected the biographical information of all the matches, liked them all, then counted the number of returning likes. They found that men and women employed drastically different mating strategies. Men liked a large proportion of the profiles they viewed, but received returning likes only 0.6% of the time; women were much more selective but received matches 10% of the time. Men received matches at a much slower rate than women. Once they received a match, women were far more likely than men to send a message, 21% compared to 7%, but they took more time before doing so. Tyson and his team found that for the first two-thirds of messages from each sex, women sent them within 18 minutes of receiving a match compared to five minutes for men. Men's first messages had an average of a dozen characters, and were typical simple greetings; by contrast, initial messages by women averaged 122 characters. Tyson and his collaborators found that the male profiles that had three profile pictures received 238 matches while the male profiles with only one profile picture received only 44 matches (or approximately a 5 to 1 ratio). Additionally, male profiles that had a biography received 69 matches while those without received only 16 matches (or approximately a 4 to 1 ratio). By sending out questionnaires to frequent Tinder users, the researchers discovered that the reason why men tended to like a large proportion of the women they saw was to increase their chances of getting a match. This led to a feedback loop in which men liked more and more of the profiles they saw while women could afford to be even more selective in liking profiles because of a greater probability of a match. The mathematical limit of the feedback loop occurs when men like all profiles they see while women find a match whenever they like a profile. It was not known whether some evolutionarily stable strategy has emerged, nor has Tinder revealed such information. Tyson and his team found that even though the men-to-women ratio of their data set was approximately one, the male profiles received 8,248 matches in total while the female profiles received only 532 matches in total because the vast majority of the matches for both the male and female profiles came from male profiles (with 86 percent of the matches for the male profiles alone coming from other male profiles), leading the researchers to conclude that homosexual men were \\"far more active in liking than heterosexual women.\\" On the other hand, the deactivated male account received all of its matches from women. The researchers were not sure why this happened.  Niche dating sites  Sites with specific demographics have become popular as a way to narrow the pool of potential matches. Successful niche sites pair people by race, sexual orientation or religion. In March 2008, the top 5 overall sites held 7% less market share than they did one year ago while the top sites from the top five major niche dating categories made considerable gains. Niche sites cater to people with special interests, such as sports fans, racing and automotive fans, medical or other professionals, people with political or religious preferences, people with medical conditions, or those living in rural farm communities. Some dating services have been created specifically for those living with HIV and other venereal diseases in an effort to eliminate the need to lie about one's health in order to find a partner. Public health officials in Rhode Island and Utah claimed in 2015 that Tinder and similar apps were responsible for uptick of such conditions. = Economic trends = Although some sites offer free trials and/or profiles, most memberships can cost upwards of $60 per month. In 2008, online dating services in the United States generated $957 million in revenue. Most free dating websites depend on advertising revenue, using tools such as Google AdSense and affiliate marketing. Since advertising revenues are modest compared to membership fees, this model requires numerous page views to achieve profitability. However, Sam Yagan describes dating sites as ideal advertising platforms because of the wealth of demographic data made available by users.  Online matchmaking services  In 2008, a variation of the online dating model emerged in the form of introduction sites, where members have to search and contact other members, who introduce them to other members whom they deem compatible. Introduction sites differ from the traditional online dating model, and attracted many users and significant investor interest. In China, the number of separations per a thousand couples doubled, from 1.46 in 2006 to about three in 2016, while the number of actual divorces continues to rise, according to the Ministry of Civil Affairs. Demand for online dating services among divorcees keeps growing, especially in the large cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou. In addition, more and more people are expected to use online dating and matchmaking services as China continues to urbanize in the late 2010s and 2020s.  Reception = Trust and safety issues = As online dating services are not required to routinely conduct background checks on members, it is possible for profile information to be misrepresented or falsified. Would background checks make dating apps safer?But These Dating Sites Still Let You Be AnonymousBackground checks split online dating industry Also, there may be users on dating services that have bad intentions (i.e. date rape, procurement, ...).Sexual predators using Tinder, dating apps to find victims, survivors and police warnOnline dating apps blocked One online dating service once introduced a real name policy, but that was later taken removed due to unpopularity with its users.OKCupid Backtracks on Its Real Names-Only Policy for Users Only some online dating services are providing important safety information such as STD status of its users How some ‚Äî but not all ‚Äî dating apps are taking on the STD epidemic Effective Internet-based partner notification urgently warrantedTinder adds link to healthvana for STD-checking purposesDo you know his STD status? There‚Äôs an app for that or other infectious diseases, but many do not. A form of misrepresentation is that members may lie about their height, weight, age, or marital status in an attempt to market or brand themselves in a particular way. Users may also carefully manipulate profiles as a form of impression management. Online daters have raised concerns about ghosting, the practice of ceasing all communication with a person without explaining why. Ghosting appears to be becoming more common. Various explanations have been suggested, but social media is often blamed, as are dating apps and the relative anonymity and isolation in modern-day dating and hookup culture, which make it easier to behave poorly with few social repercussions. Online dating site members may try to balance an accurate representation with maintaining their image in a desirable way. One study found that nine out of ten participants had lied on at least one attribute, though lies were often slight; weight was the most lied about attribute, and age was the least lied about. Furthermore, knowing a large amount of superficial information about a potential partner's interests may lead to a false sense of security when meeting up with a new person. Gross misrepresentation may be less likely on matrimonials sites than on casual dating sites. Some profiles may not even represent real humans but rather they may be fake \\"bait profiles\\" placed online by site owners to attract new paying members, or \\"spam profiles\\" created by advertisers to market services and products. Opinions on regarding the safety of online dating are mixed. Over 50% of research participants in a 2011 study did not view online dating as a dangerous activity, whereas 43% thought that online dating involved risk. = Billing complaints = Online subscription-based services can suffer from complaints about billing practices. Some online dating service providers may have fraudulent membership fees or credit card charges. Some sites do not allow members to preview available profiles before paying a subscription fee. Furthermore, different functionalities may be offered to members who have paid or not paid for subscriptions, resulting in some confusion around who can view or contact whom. Consolidation within the online dating industry has led to different newspapers and magazines now advertising the same website database under different names. In the UK, for example, Time Out (\\"London Dating\\"), The Times (\\"Encounters\\"), and The Daily Telegraph (\\"Kindred Spirits\\"), all offer differently named portals to the same service‚Äîmeaning that a person who subscribes through more than one publication has unwittingly paid more than once for access to the same service. = Imbalanced gender ratios = Little is known about the sex ratio controlled for age. eHarmony's membership is about 57% female and 43% male, whereas the ratio at Match.com is about the reverse of that. When one gets into the specialty niche websites where the primary demographic is male, one typically gets a very unbalanced ratio of male to female or female to male.Brandchannel.com . Retrieved 21 November 2007. As of June 2015, 62% of Tinder users were male and 38% were female. Studies have suggested that men are far more likely to send messages on dating sites than women. In addition, men tend to message the most attractive women regardless of their own attractiveness. This leads to the most attractive women on these sites receiving an overwhelming number of messages, which can in some cases result in them leaving the site. There is some evidence that there may be differences in how women online rate male attractiveness as opposed to how men rate female attractiveness. The distribution of ratings given by men of female attractiveness appears to be the normal distribution, while ratings of men given by women is highly skewed, with 80% of men rated as below average. = Allegations of discrimination = Gay rights groups have complained that certain websites that restrict their dating services to heterosexual couples are discriminating against homosexuals. Homosexual customers of the popular eHarmony dating website have made many attempts to litigate discriminatory practices. eHarmony was sued in 2007 by a lesbian claiming that \\"[s]uch outright discrimination is hurtful and disappointing for a business open to the public in this day and age.\\" In light of discrimination by sexual orientation by dating websites, some services such as GayDar.net and Chemistry.com cater more to homosexual dating.  Lawsuits filed against online dating services  A 2011 class action lawsuit alleged Match.com failed to remove inactive profiles, did not accurately disclose the number of active members, and does not police its site for fake profiles; the inclusion of expired and spam profiles as valid served to both artificially inflate the total number of profiles and camouflage a skewed gender ratio in which active users were disproportionately single males. The suit claimed up to 60 percent were inactive profiles, fake or fraudulent users. Some of the spam profiles were alleged to be using images of porn actresses, models, or people from other dating sites. Former employees alleged Match routinely and intentionally over-represented the number of active members on the website and a huge percentage were not real members but 'filler profiles'. A 2012 class action against Successful Match ended with a November 2014 California jury award of $1.4 million in compensatory damages and $15 million in punitive damages. SuccessfulMatch operated a dating site for people with STDs, PositiveSingles, which it advertised as offering a \\"fully anonymous profile\\" which is \\"100% confidential\\". The company failed to disclose that it was placing those same profiles on a long list of affiliate site domains such as GayPozDating.com, AIDSDate.com, HerpesInMouth.com, ChristianSafeHaven.com, MeetBlackPOZ.com, HIVGayMen.com, STDHookup.com, BlackPoz.com, and PositivelyKinky.com. This falsely implied that those users were black, Christian, gay, HIV-positive or members of other groups with which the registered members did not identify. The jury found PositiveSingles guilty of fraud, malice, and oppressionhttp://www.courthousenews.com/2014/11/03/PositiveSingles%20State.pdf as the plaintiffs' race, sexual orientation, HIV status, and religion were misrepresented by exporting each dating profile to niche sites associated with each trait. In 2013, a former employee sued adultery website Ashley Madison claiming repetitive strain injuries as creating 1000 fake profiles in one three week span \\"required an enormous amount of keyboarding\\" which caused the worker to develop severe pain in her wrists and forearms. AshleyMadison's parent company, Avid Life Media, countersued in 2014, alleging the worker kept confidential documents, including copies of her \\"work product and training materials.\\" The firm claimed the fake profiles were for \\"quality assurance testing\\" to test a new Brazilian version of the site for \\"consistency and reliability.\\" In January 2014, an already-married Facebook user attempting to close a pop-up advertisement for Zoosk.com found that one click instead copied personal info from her Facebook profile to create an unwanted online profile seeking a mate, leading to a flood of unexpected responses from amorous single males. In 2014, It's Just Lunch International was the target of a New York class action alleging unjust enrichment as IJL staff relied on a uniform, misleading script which informed prospective customers during initial interviews that IJL already had at least two matches in mind for those customers' first dates regardless of whether or not that was true. In 2014, the US Federal Trade Commission fined UK-based JDI Dating (a group of 18 websites, including Cupidswand.com and FlirtCrowd.com) over US$600000, finding that \\"the defendants offered a free plan that allowed users to set up a profile with personal information and photos. As soon as a new user set up a free profile, he or she began to receive messages that appeared to be from other members living nearby, expressing romantic interest or a desire to meet. However, users were unable to respond to these messages without upgrading to a paid membership ... [t]he messages were almost always from fake, computer- generated profiles ‚Äî 'Virtual Cupids' ‚Äî created by the defendants, with photos and information designed to closely mimic the profiles of real people.\\" The FTC also found that paid memberships were being renewed without client authorisation. On June 30, 2014, co-founder and former marketing vice president of Tinder, Whitney Wolfe, filed a sexual harassment and sex discrimination suit in Los Angeles County Superior Court against IAC-owned Match Group, the parent company of Tinder. The lawsuit alleged that her fellow executives and co-founders Rad and Mateen had engaged in discrimination, sexual harassment, and retaliation against her, while Tinder's corporate supervisor, IAC's Sam Yagan, did nothing. IAC suspended CMO Mateen from his position pending an ongoing investigation, and stated that it \\"acknowledges that Mateen sent private messages containing 'inappropriate content,' but it believes Mateen, Rad and the company are innocent of the allegations\\". In December 2018, The Verge reported that Tinder had dismissed Rosette Pambakian, the company's vice president of marketing and communication who had accused Tinder's former CEO Greg Blatt of sexual assault, along with several other employees who were part of the group of Tinder employees who had previously sued the Match Group for $2 billion.  Government regulation  U.S. government regulation of dating services began with the International Marriage Broker Regulation Act (IMBRA) which took effect in March 2007 after a federal judge in Georgia upheld a challenge from the dating site European Connections. The law requires dating services meeting specific criteria‚Äîincluding having as their primary business to connect U.S. citizens/residents with foreign nationals‚Äîto conduct, among other procedures, sex offender checks on U.S. customers before contact details can be provided to the non-U.S. citizen. In 2008, the state of New Jersey passed a law which requires the sites to disclose whether they perform background checks. In the People's Republic of China, using a transnational matchmaking agency involving a monetary transaction is illegal. The Philippines prohibits the business of organizing or facilitating marriages between Filipinas and foreign men under the Republic Act 6955 (the Anti-Mail-Order Bride Law) of June 13, 1990; this law is routinely circumvented by basing mail-order bride websites outside the country. Singapore's Social Development Network is the governmental organization facilitating dating activities in the country. Singapore's government has actively acted as a matchmaker for singles for the past few decades, and thus only 4% of Singaporeans have ever used an online dating service, despite the country's high rate of internet penetration. In December 2010, a New York State Law called the \\"Internet Dating Safety Act\\" (S5180-A) went into effect that requires online dating sites with customers in New York State to warn users not to disclose personal information to people they do not know.

It manufactures sports cars and racing cars noted for their light weight and fine handling characteristics. Lotus was previously involved in Formula One racing, via Team Lotus, winning the Formula One World Championship seven times. Lotus Cars was founded and owned for many years by Colin Chapman. After his death and a period of financial instability, it was bought by General Motors, then Romano Artioli and DRB-HICOM through its subsidiary Proton. It is currently owned by Chinese multinational Geely. The engineering consultancy firm Lotus Engineering, an offshoot of Lotus Cars, has facilities in the United Kingdom, United States, China, and Malaysia.  History = Early years = The company was formed as Lotus Engineering Ltd. by engineers Colin Chapman and Colin Dare, both graduates of University College, London, in 1952, but had earlier origins in 1948 when Chapman built his first racing car in a garage. The four letters in the middle of the logo stand for the initials of company founder, Anthony Colin Bruce Chapman. When the logo was created, Colin Chapman's original partners Michael and Nigel Allen were led to believe that the letters stood for Colin Chapman and the Allen Brothers. The first factory was situated in old stables behind the Railway Hotel in Hornsey, North London. Team Lotus, which was split off from Lotus Engineering in 1954, was active and competitive in Formula One racing from 1958 to 1994. The Lotus Group of Companies was formed in 1959. This was made up of Lotus Cars Limited and Lotus Components Limited, which focused on road cars and customer competition car production, respectively. Lotus Components Limited became Lotus Racing Limited in 1971 but the newly renamed entity ceased operation in the same year.Golden Gate Lotus Club Retrieved 1 May 2008 The company moved to a purpose built factory at Cheshunt in 1959Lotus cars Cheshunt. Retrieved 26 December 2007. and since 1966 the company has occupied a modern factory and road test facility at Hethel, near Wymondham in Norfolk. The site is a former World War II airfield, RAF Hethel, and the test track uses sections of the old runway. In its early days, Lotus sold cars aimed at privateer racers and trialists. Its early road cars could be bought as kits, in order to save on purchase tax. The kit car era ended in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Lotus Elan Plus Two being the first Lotus road car not to be offered in kit form, and the Lotus Eclat and Lotus Elite of the mid-1970s being offered only in factory built versions. After the elegant but delicate Lotus Elite of the 1950s, which featured a complete fibreglass monocoque fitted with built-in steel pickup points for mounting major components, Lotus found critical and sales success in the 1960s with the Lotus Elan two seater later developed to two plus two form. Lotus was notable for its use of fibreglass bodies, backbone chassis, and overhead camshaft engines, initially supplied by Coventry Climax but later replaced by Lotus-Ford units (Ford block, Lotus head and twin cam valve gear). Lotus worked with Ford on the Lotus Cortina, a successful sports saloon. Another Lotus of the late 1960s and early 1970s was the two seater Lotus Europa, initially intended only for the European market, which paired a backbone chassis and lightweight body with a mid mounted Renault engine, later upgraded to the Lotus-Ford twin cam unit as used in the Elan. The Lotus Seven, originating in the 1950s as a simple, lightweight open two seater continued in production into the early 70s. Lotus then sold the rights to produce the Seven to Caterham, which has continued to produce the car since then. By the mid-1970s, Lotus sought to move upmarket with the launch of the Elite and Eclat models, four seaters aimed at prosperous buyers, with features such as optional air conditioning and optional automatic transmissions. The mid engined line continued with the Lotus Esprit, which was to prove one of the company's longest lived and most iconic models. Lotus developed its own series of four cylinder DOHC engines, the Lotus 900 series, and later a V8, and turbocharged versions of the engines appeared in the Esprit. Variants of the 900 series engine were supplied for the Jensen Healey sports car and the Sunbeam Lotus \\"hot hatchback\\". In the 1980s, Lotus collaborated with Vauxhall Motors to produce the Lotus Carlton, the fastest roadgoing Vauxhall car. =Financial troubles, death of Chapman= By 1980, Group Lotus was in serious financial trouble. Production had dropped from 1,200 units per year to a mere 383. The combined reasons were that the world was in the middle of an economic recession, sales in the key United States market had virtually collapsed and there had been limited development of the then model range. In early 1982, Chapman came to an agreement with Toyota to exchange intellectual property and applied expertise. This initially resulted in Lotus Engineering helping to develop the Mk2 Toyota Supra, also known as the Toyota Celica XX. Secondly, it allowed Lotus to launch the new Lotus Excel to replace the ageing Lotus Eclat. Using drivetrain and other components from Toyota enabled Lotus to sell the Excel for ¬£1,109 less than the outgoing Eclat. Looking to re-enter the North American market, Chapman was approached by young law professor and investment banking consultant, Joe Bianco, who proposed a new and separate United States sales company for Lotus. By creating an unprecedented tax-incentived mechanism wherein each investor received a specially personalised Lotus Turbo Esprit, the new American company, Lotus Performance Cars Inc. (LPCI), was able to provide fresh capital to the Group Lotus in the United Kingdom. Former Ferrari North America general manager John Spiech was brought in to run LPCI, which imported the remarkable Giugiaro-designed Turbo Esprit for the first time. US sales began to quickly jump into triple digits annually.Car and Driver, \\"Lotus Lives\\", April 1983 Chapman died of a heart attack on 16 December 1982 at the age of 54, having begun life an innkeeper's son and ended a multi-millionaire industrialist in post-war Britain. At the time of his death, the car maker had built thousands of successful racing and road cars and won the Formula One World Championship seven times. At the time of his death, both Chapman and Lotus were linked with the DeLorean Motor Company scandal over the use of UK Government subsidies for the production of the DMC DeLorean, for which Lotus had designed the chassis. Chasing large sums of money which had disappeared from the DeLorean company, Lotus was besieged by Inland Revenue inspectors, who imposed an ¬£84 million legal \\"protective assessment\\" on the company. Chapman died before the full deceit unravelled but, at the subsequent trial of Fred Bushell, the Lotus accountant, the judge insisted that had Chapman himself been in the dock, he would have received a sentence \\"of at least 10 years\\". With Group Lotus near bankruptcy in 1983, David Wickins, the founder of British Car Auctions, agreed to become the new company chairman, through an introduction from his friend Mark Thatcher. Taking a combined 29% BCA/personal stake in Group Lotus, Wickins negotiated with the Inland Revenue, and then brought in new investors: merchant bank Schroeder-Wagg (14%); Michael Ashcroft's Bermudian operating company Benor (14%); Sir Anthony Bamford of JCB (12%). Wickins oversaw a complete turnaround in the company's fortunes, which resulted in him being called \\"The saviour of Lotus\\". =International ownership= Despite having employed designer Peter Stevens to revamp the range and design two new concept cars, by 1985 the British investors recognised that they lacked the required capital to invest in the required new model development to production, and sought to find a major motor manufacturing buyer. In January 1986, Wickins oversaw the majority sale of the Group Lotus companies and 100% of North American‚Äìbased LPCI to General Motors, with engineer Bob Eaton a big Lotus car fan. After four months of controlling but co-owning Group Lotus with Toyota, the Japanese company sold out to GM. By October 1986, GM had acquired a 91% stake in Group Lotus for ¬£22.7 million, which allowed them to legally force the company buyout. On 27 August 1993, GM sold the company, for ¬£30 million, to A.C.B.N. Holdings S.A. of Luxembourg, a company controlled by Italian businessman Romano Artioli, who also owned Bugatti Automobili SpA. In 1996, a majority share in Lotus was sold to Proton, a Malaysian car company listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange. On 24 May 2017, Chinese multinational Geely announced that was taking a 51% controlling stake in Lotus. The remaining 49% were acquired by Etika Automotive. Operations Currently organised as Group Lotus plc, the business is divided into Lotus Cars and Lotus Engineering. As well as sports car manufacture, the company also acts as an engineering consultancy, providing engineering development‚Äîparticularly of suspension- for other car manufacturers. Lotus's powertrain department is responsible for the design and development of the 4-cylinder Ecotec engine found in many of GM's Vauxhall, Opel, Saab, Chevrolet and Saturn cars. The US Lotus Elise and Exige models used the 1.8L VVTL-i I4 from Toyota's late Celica GT-S and the Matrix XRS both of which are no longer available new. The new Exige has the same V6 engine as its bigger counterpart the Evora and is not available in the US as a road-legal vehicle. Michael Kimberley, who had been a guiding light at Lotus in the 1970s, returned and took over as the Acting chief executive officer of the Company and its Group from May 2006. He chaired the Executive Committee of Lotus Group International Limited (\\"LGIL\\") established in February 2006, with Syed Zainal Abidin (managing director of Proton Holdings Berhad) and Badrul Feisal (non-executive director of Proton Holdings Berhad). LGIL is the holding company of Lotus Group Plc. Kimberley retired as CEO on 17 July 2009, replaced on 1 October 2009 by the former Senior Vice-President for Commercial & Brand at Ferrari, Dany Bahar. Bahar intended to drive the brand up-market into the expanding global luxury goods sector, effectively away from the company's traditional light weight and pure driving experience simplicity. Bahar was suspended as CEO on 25 May 2012 on a temporary basis, while an investigation into his conduct was undertaken. Lotus announced on 7 June 2012 the termination of Bahar's employment and the appointment of Aslam Farikullah as the new chief operating officer. The ambitious plans for several new models were subsequently cancelled following Bahar's departure. Jean Marc Gales replaced Bahar as the CEO of the company in 2014 and enabled the company to make a profit after decades in 2017 due to his effective market plans and strategies, before he left the company in June 2018 due to personal reasons and was replaced by Feng Qingfeng from Lotus Group's parent company, Geely. October 2018 saw further senior changes as Phil Popham was named CEO of Lotus Cars with Feng Qingfeng remaining in charge of Group Lotus.  Formula One and motorsport  Lotus 72 Lotus 77 Lotus 99T alt= In its early days, the company encouraged its customers to race its cars, and it first entered Formula One through its sister company Team Lotus in 1958. A Lotus Formula One car driven by Stirling Moss won the marque's first Grand Prix in 1960 at Monaco. Moss drove a Lotus 18 entered by privateer Rob Walker. Major success came in 1963 with the Lotus 25, which ‚Äì with Jim Clark driving ‚Äì won Team Lotus its first F1 World Constructors Championship. Clark's untimely death ‚Äì he crashed a Formula Two Lotus 48 in April 1968 after his rear tyre failed in a turn in Hockenheim ‚Äì was a severe blow to the team and to Formula One. He was the dominant driver in the dominant car and remains an inseparable part of Lotus's early years. That year's championship was won by Clark's teammate, Graham Hill. Team Lotus is credited with making the mid-engined layout popular for IndyCars, developing the first monocoque Formula One chassis, and the integration of the engine and transaxle as chassis components. Team Lotus was also among the pioneers in Formula One in adding wings and shaping the undersurface of the car to create downforce, as well as the first to move radiators to the sides of the car to aid in aerodynamic performance and inventing active suspension. Even after Chapman's death, until the late 1980s, Team Lotus continued to be a major player in Formula One. Ayrton Senna drove for the team from 1985 to 1987, winning twice in each year and achieving 17 pole positions. By the company's last Formula One race in 1994, the cars were no longer competitive. Team Lotus constructed cars won a total of 79 Grand Prix races. During his lifetime Chapman saw Lotus beat Ferrari as the first Marque to achieve 50 Grand Prix victories, despite Ferrari having won their first nine years sooner. Formula One Drivers' Championship winner for Lotus were Jim Clark in 1963 and 1965, Graham Hill in 1968, Jochen Rindt in 1970, Emerson Fittipaldi in 1972 and Mario Andretti in 1978. In 1973 Lotus won the constructors' championship only; the drivers' title went to Jackie Stewart of Tyrrell. Team Lotus established Classic Team Lotus in 1992, as the Works historic motorsport activity. Classic Team Lotus continues to maintain Lotus F1 cars and run them in the FIA Historic Formula One Championship and it preserves the Team Lotus archive and Works Collection of cars, under the management of Colin Chapman's son, Clive. Team Lotus's participation in Formula One ended at the end of the 1994 season. Former racing driver David Hunt (brother of F1 world champion James Hunt) purchased the name 'Team Lotus' and licensed it to the Formula One team Pacific Racing, which was rebranded Pacific Team Lotus. The Pacific Team folded at the end of the 1995 season. The Lotus name returned to Formula One for the 2010 season, when a new Malaysian team called Lotus Racing was awarded an entry. The new team used the Lotus name under licence from Group Lotus and was unrelated to the original Team Lotus. In September 2010 Group Lotus, with agreement from its parent company Proton, terminated the licence for future seasons as a result of what it called \\"flagrant and persistent breaches of the licence by the team\\". Lotus Racing then announced that it had acquired Team Lotus Ventures Ltd, the company led by David Hunt, and with it full ownership of the rights to the \\"Team Lotus\\" brand and heritage. The team confirmed that it would be known as Team Lotus from 2011 onwards. In December 2010 Group Lotus announced the creation of Lotus Renault GP, the successor to the Renault F1 team. This team contested the 2011 season having purchased a title sponsorship deal with the team, with the option to buy shares in the future. The team's car for that season, the R31, was badged as a Renault, while Team Lotus's car, the T128, was badged as a Lotus. In May 2011, the British High Court of Justice ruled that Team Lotus could continue to use the \\"Team Lotus\\" name, but Group Lotus had sole right to use the \\"Lotus\\" name on its own. As a consequence, for Lotus Renault GP was rebranded as Lotus F1 Team and its cars were badged as Lotuses, while Team Lotus was renamed Caterham F1 Team (after the sports car manufacturer owned by team principal Tony Fernandes) and its cars were badged as Caterhams. Group Lotus is currently also involved in several other categories of motorsport. It sponsors the KV team in the IndyCar Series and used to sponsor the ART team in the GP2 and GP3 Series in 2011 and 2012. In 2011, Lotus also returned to the 24 Hours of Le Mans with a semi-works effort run by Jetalliance Racing, which fielded two Lotus Evoras. After fielding underpowered and uncompetitive engines in the 2012 Indianapolis 500, in which drivers Jean Alesi and Simona de Silvestro were black-flagged after ten laps for failing to maintain a competitive pace, Lotus was released from its contract and did not participate in future seasons.  Lotus car models  alt= alt= =Current= Current Lotus models include: * Lotus Elise: The Elise was launched in 1996 and weighed . The current range of Elise's starts at and incorporates some engineering innovations, such as an aluminium extrusion frame and a composite body shell. The Elise has spawned several racing variants, including a limited series called the 340R, which has an open-body design echoing the old Seven. The Elise was introduced into the US, with a Toyota engine, to pass strict US emissions laws. The 1ZZ & 2ZZ Toyota engines used to have a Lotus ECU with their own fuel mapping. The supercharged Lotus Elise S (which replaced the SC model) and limited edition Jim Clark Type 25 Elise editions add a new performance dimension to the Elise range. 0‚Äì60 mph acceleration is in 4.3 seconds and 0‚Äì100 km/h in 4.6 seconds. The Elise spawned into its third generation in 2012 where it saw more power being added and more newer variants such as the Elise Cup 250 being introduced. * Lotus Exige: The coup√© version of the Elise which is in production since 2000. Currently the Exige has a variety of variants ranging from the Sport 350 to the Cup 430. All variants of the Exige feature the Supercharged Toyota DOHC V6 from the Lotus Evora. * Lotus Evora: The Lotus Evora was unveiled on 22 July 2008. It was code named Project Eagle during development. The Evora is 2+2 sports car with a mid-mounted, transverse 3.5-litre V6 engine. Lotus unveiled a more powerful variant of the Evora called the Evora S in 2011 which Lotus provided as Rapid Response Vehicles to the Rome and Milan Carabinieri to replace the previous Lamborghini Gallardos. A facelifted and more powerful Evora 400 model was unveiled at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show after Lotus discontinued the standard Evora and the Evora S. The Evora 400 was followed up by the Evora Sport 410 which was unveiled at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show. Another powerful variant called the Evora GT430 was unveiled in September 2017. = Previous = alt= alt= alt= alt= Lotus Elan +2S, 1973 alt= alt= alt= alt= alt= alt= Opel Speedster/Vauxhall VX220 (based on the Lotus Elise S2) * Lotus Mark I (1948): Austin 7‚Äìbased sports car * Lotus Mark II (1949‚Äì1950): Ford-powered trials car * Lotus Mark III (1951): 750 cc formula car * Lotus Mark IV (1952): Trials car * Lotus Mark V (1952): 750 cc formula car, never built * Lotus Mark VI (1953‚Äì1955): The first \\"production\\" racer, about 100 built * Lotus Seven (1957‚Äì1972): A minimalist open sports car designed to manoeuvre a racing circuit.The rights to the Seven were sold in 1973 to Caterham Cars.

It became apparent in July 2012 that the firm's financial difficulties had made this plan impossible to implement, and initially all but the Esprit project were cancelled. Subsequently, the Esprit project was also cancelled. Lotus also showed an unnamed city car concept using its 1.2L range-extender engine. In 2011, Lotus revealed this as the Lotus Ethos, a plug-in hybrid car based on the EMAS concept from its parent company Proton, and likely to be primarily built by Proton in Malaysia. This car has also been cancelled. Lotus CEO at the time Jean Marc Gales confirmed in 2017 that development of an SUV is currently under way, after the company was acquired by the Chinese automotive manufacturer, Geely. In July 2019 Lotus revealed the Evija, a 1470kW (2000 PS; 1970hp) and 1700 Nm (1254 lb ft) electric supercar.

This all- aluminium, monoblock, 1200 cc, three-cylinder, 47 horsepower, four-stroke engine is specifically designed to directly drive an alternator for electricity generation for series-hybrid cars. The engine is small and light at , having three cylinders and no detachable cylinder head. The cylinder head and engine block are all one casting to reduce size, weight and production costs. As the engine does not turn belt driven ancillaries such as alternator, power-steering pump or an air conditioning compressor, the block requires no strong points to accommodate such ancillaries, resulting in a simple and light block. The engine has a reduced parts count for lightness and cheaper production. * On 18 August 2011 Lotus developed an all new in-house designed V8 destined for the new era range of cars. At and just long, the unit is dry sump lubricated to save depth and will feature a 180¬∞ flat plane crank. The engine is being utilised as a stressed component, a technique pioneered by Colin Chapman in F1, specifically with the 1967 Type 49. It was expected to be used in the Le Mans LMP2 car in 2012.

Whereas the VVA technology was to be used in the development of a new mid-engine sportscar for Lotus cars, the APX is, in fact, a high-performance 7-seat MPV with four-wheel drive and a front- mounted V6 engine from Lotus Engineering's Powertrain division. The engine was designed and developed to be available in a 2.2-litre naturally aspirated and 3.0-litre supercharged variations. Versatile Vehicle Architecture (VVA) is an effort by the Lotus car manufacturing company to reduce the investment needed for producing unique, niche-market cars by sharing a number of common components.

Queen's Award for Enterprise Lotus Cars were awarded the Queen's Award for Enterprise for contribution to International Trade, one of 85 companies receiving the recognition in that category in 2002. Lotus cars wore the badge of the award for a number of years. In popular culture Lotus cars appeared in two James Bond movies, The Spy Who Loved Me (1977) and For Your Eyes Only (1981). The former was a Lotus Esprit S1 nicknamed \\"Wet Nellie\\" which in the movie became not only amphibious but a submarine; the latter was a Lotus Esprit Turbo, specially commissioned, of which there were two in the film. In the popular 1960s TV series The Avengers, the female lead characters drove Lotuses. Emma Peel had two Lotus Elan convertibles, a white S2 and a metallic blue S3 while her successor Tara King drove a red Elan +2 and a red Europa. The lead character known only as Number Six drove a 1965 Lotus Super 7 in the 1967 TV series The Prisoner. Lotus cars also appeared in the movies Pretty Woman and Basic Instinct. Gremlin Graphics produced the Lotus video game series in the early 1990s, featuring the company's cars.

They are particularly important in consensus decision making and deliberative democracy, but they have always been recognized as important to judicial procedure and parliamentary procedure, down to the level of the town meeting or below. There are also several types of meetings, Formal meeting, Annual General Meeting, Statutory Meeting, Board Meeting. There are many such systems, of which one of the best-known is probably Robert's Rules of Order, which is applied in parliamentary debate and corporate meetings in many English-speaking countries. Also well-known is the cross-examination debate applied in both criminal law and civil law. Much innovation in meeting systems has come from objection to these two basic models, notably because both reflect an adversarial process. When used in political or economic contexts, meeting systems are very often associated with a voting system. When used in matchmaking or other sexual/romantic contexts, a meeting system is considered a dating system. These are discussed in other articles.

He was the author of several books, including The Hidden Persuaders and The Naked Society. He was a critic of consumerism. Early life Vance Packard was born on May 22, 1914 in Granville Summit, Pennsylvania, to Philip J. Packard and Mabel Case Packard. Between 1920 and 1932, he attended local public schools in State College, Pennsylvania, where his father managed a dairy farm owned by the Pennsylvania State College (later Penn State University). He identified himself as a \\"farm boy\\" throughout his life, although he moved to State College and in later life lived in affluent areas.Nelson, M.T., \\"The Hidden Persuaders: Then and Now,\\" Journal of Advertising, Vol. 37, no. 1, 2008, DOI: 10.2753/JOA0091-3367370109, p. 114 In 1932, he entered Pennsylvania State University, where he earned a B.A. degree, majoring in English. He graduated in 1936, and worked briefly for the local newspaper, the Centre Daily Times. He earned his master's degree at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in 1937. Career Packard joined the Boston Daily Record as a staff reporter in 1937. He became a reporter for the Associated Press around 1940, and in 1942, joined the staff of The American Magazine as a section editor, later becoming a staff writer. That periodical closed in July, 1956, and Packard became a writer at Collier's. After its closing by the end of the year, he devoted his full attention to developing book-length projects of his own. Halfway into the next year,\\"The Hidden Persuaders ‚Äì Paperback\\" his The Hidden Persuaders was published to national attention, launching him into a career as a full-time social critic, lecturing and developing further books.Horowitz, D., Vance Packard and Social Criticism, Horowitz, 1994, p.6 He was a critic of consumerism, which he viewed as an attack on the traditional American way of life. In July 2020, an academic description reported on the nature and rise of the \\"robot prosumer\\", derived from modern-day technology and related participatory culture, that, in turn, was substantially predicted earlier by science fiction writers, as well as Packard. =The Hidden Persuaders= Vance Packard's book The Hidden Persuaders, about media manipulation in the 1950s, sold more than a million copies. In The Hidden Persuaders, first published in 1957, Packard explored advertisers' use of consumer motivational research and other psychological techniques, including depth psychology and subliminal tactics, to manipulate expectations and induce desire for products, particularly in the American postwar era. He identified eight \\"compelling needs\\" that advertisers promise products will fulfill. According to Packard, these needs are so strong that people are compelled to buy products merely to satisfy them. The book also explores the manipulative techniques of promoting politicians to the electorate. Additionally, the book questions the morality of using these techniques.Gordon Di Renzo (1958) The American Catholic Sociological Review, Vol. 19, No. 4 (Dec., 1958) (Review) While the book was a top-seller among middle-class audiences, it was widely criticised by marketing researchers and advertising executives as carrying a sensationalist tone and containing unsubstantiated assertions.Nelson, M.T., \\"The Hidden Persuaders: Then and Now,\\" Journal of Advertising, Vol. 37, no. 1, 2008, DOI: 10.2753/JOA0091-3367370109, p. 113 = The Naked Society = In a 1964 essay called \\"The Naked Society\\", Packard criticized advertisers' unfettered use of private information to create marketing schemes. He compared a recent Great Society initiative by then-president Lyndon B. Johnson, the National Data Bank, to the use of information by advertisers and argued for increased data privacy measures to ensure that information did not find its way into the wrong hands. The essay led Congress to create the Special Subcommittee on the Invasion of Privacy and inspired privacy advocates such Neil Gallagher and Sam Ervin to fight Johnson's flagrant disregard for consumer privacy. Personal life and death Packard was married to Virginia Matthews; they had two sons and a daughter. They resided in New Canaan, Connecticut and Martha's Vineyard.

In 1960, Wac≈Çaw Sierpi≈Ñski proved that there are infinitely many odd integers k which have this property. In other words, when k is a Sierpi≈Ñski number, all members of the following set are composite: :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\, k \\\\cdot 2^n + 1 : n \\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}\\\\,\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. If the form is instead k \\\\times 2^n - 1 , then k is a Riesel number. Known Sierpi≈Ñski numbers The sequence of currently known Sierpi≈Ñski numbers begins with: : 78557, 271129, 271577, 322523, 327739, 482719, 575041, 603713, 903983, 934909, 965431, 1259779, 1290677, 1518781, 1624097, 1639459, 1777613, 2131043, 2131099, 2191531, 2510177, 2541601, 2576089, 2931767, 2931991, ... . The number 78557 was proved to be a Sierpi≈Ñski number by John Selfridge in 1962, who showed that all numbers of the form have a factor in the covering set }. For another known Sierpi≈Ñski number, 271129, the covering set is }. Most currently known Sierpi≈Ñski numbers possess similar covering sets.Sierpinski number at The Prime Glossary However, in 1995 A. S. Izotov showed that some fourth powers could be proved to be Sierpi≈Ñski numbers without establishing a covering set for all values of n. His proof depends on the aurifeuillean factorization . This establishes that all give rise to a composite, and so it remains to eliminate only using a covering set. Sierpi≈Ñski problem The Sierpi≈Ñski problem asks for the value of the smallest Sierpi≈Ñski number. In private correspondence with Paul Erd≈ës, Selfridge conjectured that 78,557 was the smallest Sierpi≈Ñski number. No smaller Sierpi≈Ñski numbers have been discovered, and it is now believed that 78,557 is the smallest number. To show that 78,557 really is the smallest Sierpi≈Ñski number, one must show that all the odd numbers smaller than 78,557 are not Sierpi≈Ñski numbers. That is, for every odd k below 78,557, there needs to exist a positive integer n such that is prime. , there are only five candidates which have not been eliminated as possible Sierpi≈Ñski numbers: : k = 21181, 22699, 24737, 55459, and 67607. The distributed volunteer computing project PrimeGrid is attempting to eliminate all the remaining values of k. , no prime has been found for these values of k, with all n \\\\le 31\\\\,875\\\\,742 having been eliminated. The most recently eliminated candidate was k = 10223, when the prime 10223\\\\times2^{31172165} + 1 was discovered by PrimeGrid in October 2016. This number is 9,383,761 digits long.Seventeen or Bust at PrimeGrid. Prime Sierpi≈Ñski problem In 1976, Nathan Mendelsohn determined that the second provable Sierpi≈Ñski number is the prime k = 271129. The prime Sierpi≈Ñski problem asks for the value of the smallest prime Sierpi≈Ñski number, and there is an ongoing \\"Prime Sierpi≈Ñski search\\" which tries to prove that 271129 is the first Sierpi≈Ñski number which is also a prime. , the nine prime values of k less than 271129 for which a prime of the form is not known are: : k = 22699, 67607, 79309, 79817, 152267, 156511, 222113, 225931, and 237019. , no prime has been found for these values of k with n \\\\le 21\\\\,874\\\\,934. The first two, being less than 78557, are also unsolved cases of the (non-prime) Sierpi≈Ñski problem described above. The most recently eliminated candidate was k = 168451, when the prime number 168451\\\\times2^{19375200} + 1 was discovered by PrimeGrid in September 2017. The number is 5,832,522 digits long. Extended Sierpi≈Ñski problem Suppose that both preceding Sierpi≈Ñski problems had finally been solved, showing that 78557 is the smallest Sierpi≈Ñski number and that 271129 is the smallest prime Sierpi≈Ñski number. This still leaves unsolved the question of the second Sierpinski number; there could exist a composite Sierpi≈Ñski number k such that 78557 < k < 271129. An ongoing search is trying to prove that 271129 is the second Sierpi≈Ñski number, by testing all k values between 78557 and 271129, prime or not. Solving the extended Sierpi≈Ñski problem, the most demanding of the three posed problems, requires the elimination of 23 remaining candidates k < 271129, of which nine are prime (see above) and fourteen are composite. The latter include k = 21181, 24737, 55459 from the original Sierpi≈Ñski problem, unique to the extended Sierpi≈Ñski problem. , the following nine values of k remain: : k = 91549, 131179, 163187, 200749, 202705, 209611, 227723, 229673, and 238411. , no prime has been found for these values of k with n \\\\le 13\\\\,081\\\\,160. In April 2018, 193997\\\\times2^{11452891} + 1 was found to be prime by PrimeGrid, eliminating k = 193997. The number is 3,447,670 digits long.

Netherlands Carl Andre (born September 16, 1935) is an American minimalist artist recognized for his ordered linear and grid format sculptures. His sculptures range from large public artworks [such as Stone Field Sculpture, 1977 in Hartford, ConnecticutHartford Advocate November 13, 1997 \\"Twenty Years After Stone Field Sculpture shook the Insurance City, Carl Andre Returns\\" by Patricia Rosoff and Lament for the Children, 1976 in Long Island City, New York], to large interior works exhibited on the floor [such as 144 Magnesium Square, 1969],to small intimate works [such as Satier: Zinc on Steel, 1989 (shown below) and 7 Alnico Pole, 2011]. Early life Andre was born September 16, 1935 in Quincy, Massachusetts. He completed primary and secondary schooling in the Quincy public school system and studied art at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts from 1951 to 1953.Naked by the Window, by Robert Katz published 1990 by The Atlantic Monthly Free Press While at Phillips Academy he became friends with Hollis Frampton who would later influence Andre's radical approach to sculpture through their conversations about art12 Dialogues, Carl Andre and Hollis Frampton 1962‚Äì1963 published by Nova Scotia College of Art and Design Press and New York University Press, edited by Benjamin HD Buchloh and through introductions to other artists.Minimalism: Art and Polemics in the Sixties, edited by James Meyer, published 2004 by Yale University Press , Andre served in the U.S. Army in North Carolina 1955‚Äì56 and moved to New York City in 1956. While in New York, Frampton introduced Andre to Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi through whom Andre became re-acquainted with a former classmate from Phillips Academy, Frank Stella, in 1958. Andre shared studio space with Stella from 1958 through 1960. Work Andre‚Äôs sculptures are often assembled using common industrial materials, which he arranges into a simple geometric pattern. His sculptures are always placed on the floor rather than on plinths. Not simply objects to look at, they become part of the environment, altering the viewer‚Äôs relationship to the surrounding space. =Early Work= Carl Andre, 144 Magnesium Square, 1969, 144 thin magnesium plates, each measuring 12 by 12 inches, 144 x 144 inches Andre has cited Br√¢ncu»ôi as inspiration for his early wood sculptures, but his conversations with Stella about space and form led him in a different direction. While sharing a studio with Stella, Andre developed a series of wooden \\"cut\\" sculptures (such as Radial Arm Saw cut sculpture, 1959, and Maple Spindle Exercise, 1959). Stella is noted as having said to Andre (regarding hunks of wood removed from Andre's sculpture) \\"Carl, that's sculpture, too.\\"Naked by the Window, by Robert Katz, published 1990 by The Atlantic Monthly Free Press From 1960 to 1964 Andre worked as freight brakeman and conductor in New Jersey for the Pennsylvania Railroad. The experience with blue collar labor and the ordered nature of conducting freight trains would have a later influence on Andre's sculpture and artistic personality. For example, it was not uncommon for Andre to dress in overalls and a blue work shirt, even to the most formal occasions.\\" During this period, Andre focused mainly on writing and there is little notable sculpture on record between 1960 and 1965. The poetry would resurface later, most notably in a book (finally published in 1980 by NYU press) called 12 Dialogues in which Andre and Hollis Frampton took turns responding to one another at a typewriter using mainly poetry and free-form essay-like texts. Andre's concrete poetry has exhibited in the United States and Europe, a comprehensive collection of which is in the collection of the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. =Mature work= thumbCarl Andre, Satier: Zinc on Steel, 1989, Zinc and steel, in two parts, 0.44 x 6 x 11.44 inIn 1965 he had his first public exhibition of work in the Shape and Structure show curated by Henry Geldzahler at the Tibor de Nagy Gallery. Andre's controversial Lever was included in the seminal 1966 show at the Jewish Museum in New York entitled Primary Structures. In the late 1960s, the entrepreneur Karl Str√∂her from Darmstadt / Germany (Wella) acquired three major works from Andre ato give them on loan to the Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt.

In 1970 he had a solo exhibition at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. =Equivalent VIII= In 1972, Britain's Tate Gallery acquired Andre's Equivalent VIII, an arrangement 120 of firebricks. Each of Andre‚Äôs eight sculptures in the Equivalent series consists of a rectangular arrangement of 120 firebricks. Although the shape of each sculpture is different, they all have the same height, mass and volume, and are therefore ‚Äòequivalent‚Äô to each other. The piece was exhibited several times without incident, but became the center of controversy in 1976 after being featured in an article in The Sunday Times and later being defaced with blue food dye. The \\"Bricks controversy\\" became one of the most famous public debates in Britain about contemporary art.John Walker. (1999). \\"Carl Andre's 'pile of bricks'- Tate Gallery acquisition controversy ‚Äì 1976\\". Art & outrage/artdesigncafe. Retrieved December 23, 2011. =Lever= Carl Andre's 'Lever' was one of the most audacious entries in the groundbreaking exhibition 1966 Primary Structures exhibition at New York‚Äôs Jewish Museum that introduced the public to minimalism. ‚ÄòLever‚Äô consists simply of a single line of 137 firebricks. The work concisely divides a space as the bricks hug the floor. ‚ÄòLever‚Äô projects out from the wall and straight across the floor and was likened by Andre to a fallen column. The exhibiting of ‚ÄòLever‚Äô at ‚ÄúPrimary Structures‚Äù brought recognition to Carl Andre. 'Lever' startled gallery visitors, as it interrupted their movement and, in its simplicity, was annoying. Made from easily available building materials (\\"anyone could do it: where was the art?\\"), Lever demanded respect from thoughtful viewers while undermining traditional artistic values. Criticism The gradual evolution of consensus about the meaning of Carl Andre's art can be found in About Carl Andre: Critical Texts Since 1965, published by Ridinghouse in 2008. The most significant essays and exhibition reviews have been collated into one volume, including texts written by some of the most influential art historians and critics: Clement Greenberg, Donald Kuspit, Lucy R. Lippard, Robert C. Morgan, Barbara Rose and Roberta Smith. Personal life In 1979 Andre first met artist Ana Mendieta through a mutual friendship with artists Leon Golub and Nancy Spero at AIR Gallery in New York City. Andre and Mendieta eventually married in 1985, but the relationship ended in tragedy. =Ana Mendieta's death= In 1988, Andre was tried and acquitted in the death of his wife, artist Ana Mendieta. Mendieta fell to her death from Andre's 34th story apartment window in 1985 after an argument with Andre. There were no eyewitnesses. A doorman in the street below had heard a woman screaming \\"No, no, no, no,\\" before Mendieta's body landed on the roof of a building below. Andre had what appeared to be fresh scratches on his nose and forearm, and his story to the police differed from his recorded statements to the 911 operator an hour or so earlier. The police arrested him. Andre was charged with second degree murder. He elected to be tried before a judge with no jury. In 1988 Andre was acquitted of all charges related to Mendieta's death. Andre remains a controversial figure, and museums who exhibit his work have been met with outrage from Mendieta's supporters. In 2017 protestors attended the opening of his exhibition at The Geffen Contemporary at MOCA in Los Angeles, distributing postcards that read ‚ÄúCarl Andre is at MOCA Geffen. ¬øD√≥nde est√° Ana Mendieta?‚Äù (Spanish for \\"Where is Ana Mendieta?\\").Miranda, Carolina. \\"Why protesters at MOCA‚Äôs Carl Andre show won‚Äôt let the art world forget about Ana Mendieta\\", The Guardian, London, 27 October 2005.

Born to the wealthy New York City Guggenheim family, she was the daughter of Benjamin Guggenheim, who went down with the Titanic in 1912, and the niece of Solomon R. Guggenheim, who established the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. Guggenheim collected art in Europe and America primarily between 1938 and 1946. She exhibited this collection as she built it; in 1949, she settled in Venice, where she lived and exhibited her collection for the rest of her life. The Peggy Guggenheim Collection is a modern art museum on the Grand Canal in Venice, Italy, and is one of the most visited attractions in Venice. Early life: inheritance, involvement in the art and writing community Both of Guggenheim's parents were of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Her mother, Florette Seligman (1870‚Äì1937), was a member of the Seligman family. When she turned 21 in 1919, Guggenheim inherited US$2.5 million, equivalent to US$ million in . Guggenheim's father, Benjamin Guggenheim, a member of the Guggenheim family, died in the sinking of the RMS Titanic, and he had not amassed the fortune of his siblings; therefore her inheritance was far less than that of her cousins. She first worked as a clerk in an avant-garde bookstore, the Sunwise Turn, where she became enamored of the members of the bohemian artistic community. In 1920 she went to live in Paris, France. Once there, she became friendly with avant-garde writers and artists, many of whom were living in poverty in the Montparnasse quarter of the city. Man Ray photographed her, and was, along with Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi and Marcel Duchamp, a friend whose art she was eventually to promote. She became close friends with writer Natalie Barney and artist Romaine Brooks and was a regular at Barney's salon. She met Djuna Barnes during this time, and in time became her friend and patron. Barnes wrote her best-known novel, Nightwood, while staying at the Devon country house, Hayford Hall, that Guggenheim had rented for two summers. Guggenheim urged Emma Goldman to write her autobiography and helped to secure funds for her to focus in Saint-Tropez, France, on writing her two volume Living My Life. She wrote another biography entitled Confessions Of An Art Addict which was released in 1946 and is now published with Harper Collins. Collecting, before World War II In January 1938, Guggenheim opened a gallery for modern art in London featuring Jean Cocteau drawings in its first show, and began to collect works of art. Guggenheim often purchased at least one object from each of her exhibitions at the gallery. After the outbreak of World War II, she purchased as much abstract and Surrealist art as possible.Walsh, John. \\"The priceless Peggy Guggenheim\\", The Independent, October 21, 2009, accessed March 12, 2012 Her first gallery was called Guggenheim Jeune, the name ingeniously chosen to associate her gallery with both the epitome of a gallery, the French Bernheim- Jeune, and with the name of her own well-known family. The gallery on 30 Cork Street, next to Roland Penrose's and E. L. T. Mesens' show-case for the Surrealist movement, proved to be successful, thanks to many friends who gave advice and who helped to run the gallery. Marcel Duchamp, whom she had known since the early 1920s, when she lived in Paris with her first husband Laurence Vail, had introduced Guggenheim to the art world; it was through him that she met many artists during her frequent visits to Paris. He taught her about contemporary art and styles, and he conceived several of the exhibitions held at Guggenheim Jeune. The Cocteau exhibition was followed by exhibitions of Wassily Kandinsky (his first one-man-show in England), Yves Tanguy, Wolfgang Paalen and several other well-known and some lesser-known artists. Peggy Guggenheim also held group exhibitions of sculpture and collage, with the participation of the now-classic moderns Antoine Pevsner, Henry Moore, Henri Laurens, Alexander Calder, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi, John Ferren, Jean Arp, Max Ernst, Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque and Kurt Schwitters. She also greatly admired the work of John Tunnard (1900‚Äì1971) and is credited with his discovery in mainstream international modernism. Plans for a museum When Guggenheim realized that her gallery, although well received, had made a loss of ¬£600 in the first year, she decided to spend her money in a more practical way. A museum for contemporary arts was exactly the institution she could see herself supporting. Most certainly on her mind also were the adventures in New York City of her uncle, Solomon R. Guggenheim, who, with the help and encouragement of artist Baroness Hilla von Rebay, had created the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation two years earlier. The main aim of this foundation had been to collect and to further the production of abstract art, resulting in the opening of the Museum of Non-objective Painting (from 1952: The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum) earlier in 1939 on East 54th Street in Manhattan. Guggenheim closed Guggenheim Jeune with a farewell party on 22 June 1939, at which colour portrait photographs by Gis√®le Freund were projected on the walls. She started making plans for a Museum of Modern Art in London together with the English art historian and art critic Herbert Read. She set aside $40,000 for the museum's running costs. However, these funds were soon overstretched by the organisers' ambitions. In August 1939, Guggenheim left for Paris to negotiate loans of artworks for the first exhibition. In her luggage was a list drawn up by Herbert Read for this occasion. Shortly after her departure the Second World War broke out, and the events following 1 September 1939 made her abandon the scheme, willingly or not. She then \\"decided now to buy paintings by all the painters who were on Herbert Read's list. Having plenty of time and all the museum's funds at my disposal, I put myself on a regime to buy one picture a day.\\" When finished, she had acquired 10 Picassos, 40 Ernsts, eight Mir√≥s, four Magrittes, four Ferrens, three Man Rays, three Dal√≠s, one Klee, one Wolfgang Paalen and one Chagall, among others. In the meantime, she had also made new plans and in April 1940 had rented a large space in the Place Vend√¥me as a new home for her museum. A few days before the Germans reached Paris, Guggenheim had to abandon her plans for a Paris museum, and fled to the south of France, from where, after months of safeguarding her collection and artist friends, she left Europe for New York in the summer of 1941. There, in the following year, she opened a new gallery‚Äîwhich actually was in part a museum‚Äîat 30 West 57th Street. It was called The Art of This Century Gallery. Three of the four galleries were dedicated to Cubist and Abstract art, Surrealism and Kinetic art, with only the fourth, the front room, being a commercial gallery. Guggenheim held other important shows, such as the show for 31 Women artists, at the gallery. Her interest in new art was instrumental in advancing the careers of several important modern artists including the American painters Jackson Pollock and William Congdon, the Austrian surrealist Wolfgang Paalen, the sound poet Ada Verdun Howell and the German painter Max Ernst, whom she married in December 1941.Biography, Peggy Guggenheim Collection Retrieved June 25, 2010 She had assembled her collection in only seven years. The collection, after World War II Following World War II ‚Äì and her 1946 divorce from Max Ernst ‚Äì she closed The Art of This Century Gallery in 1947, and returned to Europe, deciding to live in Venice, Italy. In 1948, she was invited to exhibit her collection in the disused Greek Pavilion of the Venice Biennale and in 1949 established herself in the Palazzo Venier dei Leoni ('unfinished palazzo of the lions') on the Grand Canal. Her collection became one of the few European collections of modern art to promote a significant number of works by Americans. In the 1950s she promoted the art of two local painters, Edmondo Bacci and Tancredi Parmeggiani. By the early 1960s, Guggenheim had almost stopped collecting art and began to concentrate on presenting what she already owned. She loaned out her collection to museums in Europe and in 1969 to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City, which was named after her uncle. Eventually, she decided to donate her home and her collection to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, a gift which was concluded inter vivos in 1976, before her death in 1979. Guggenheim's grave, with a plaque remembering her Lhasa Apsos (dogs) The Peggy Guggenheim Collection is one of the most important museums in Italy for European and American art of the first half of the 20th century. Pieces in her collection embrace Cubism, Surrealism and Abstract Expressionism. Guggenheim lived in Venice until her death in Camposampiero near Padua, Italy, after a stroke. Her ashes are interred in the garden (later the Nasher Sculpture Garden) of her home, the Palazzo Venier dei Leoni (inside the Peggy Guggenheim Collection), next to her dogs. Private life According to both Guggenheim and her biographer Anton Gill, it was believed that while living in Europe, she had \\"slept with 1,000 men\\".\\"Thomas Messer\\", Telegraph obituary, 23 May 2013 She claimed to have had affairs with numerous artists and writers, and in return many artists and others have claimed affairs with her. When asked by conductor Thomas Schippers how many husbands she had, she replied, \\"You mean my own, or other people's?\\" In her autobiography, Peggy provides the names of some of these lovers, including Yves Tanguy, Roland Penrose and E. L. T. Mesens.Out of this Century: Confessions of an Art Addict, Peggy Guggenheim, published by Andre Deutsch, London. 2005. Her first marriage was to Laurence Vail, a Dada sculptor and writer with whom she had two children, Michael Cedric Sindbad Vail (1923‚Äì1986) and Pegeen Vail Guggenheim (1925‚Äì1967). They divorced in about 1928 following his affair with writer Kay Boyle, whom he later married. Soon after her first marriage dissolved, she had an affair with John Ferrar Holms, a writer with writer's block who had been a war hero.Vail, Karole P. B. Peggy Guggenheim: A Centennial Celebration Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation (1998), p. 78. Starting in December 1939, she and Samuel Beckett had a brief but intense affair, and he encouraged her to turn exclusively to modern art. She married her second husband, painter Max Ernst, in 1941 and divorced him in 1946. Among her eight grandchildren is Karole Vail, who was appointed director of the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in 2017.Barone, Joshua. \\"The Peggy Guggenheim Collection Names Its New Director\\", The New York Times, June 8, 2017, accessed July 30, 2017 Portrayal in popular culture *Guggenheim was portrayed by Amy Madigan in the movie Pollock (2000), directed by and starring Ed Harris, based on the life of Jackson Pollock. *A play by Lanie Robertson based on Guggenheim's life, Woman Before a Glass, opened at the Promenade Theatre on Broadway, New York on March 10, 2005.

Sited in the centre of O'Connell Street, the city's main thoroughfare, it is one of Ireland's most famous buildings, not least because it served as the headquarters of the leaders of the Easter Rising. It was the last of the great Georgian public buildings erected in the capital. Architecture The foundation-stone of the building, which was designed by Francis Johnston, was laid by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Charles Whitworth, 1st Earl Whitworth, on 12 August 1814, attended by the Post-Masters-General, Charles O'Neill, 1st Earl O'Neill and Laurence Parsons, 2nd Earl of Rosse. The structure was completed in the short space of approximately three years at a cost (depending on sources) of between ¬£50,000 and ¬£80,000. Royal Coat of Arms, similar to those at King's Inns and the Irish Houses of Parliament, was removed after independence. The front, which extends 67.1 metres (220 ft), has an Ionic portico (24.4 metres (80 ft) wide), of six fluted Ionic columns, 137.16 centimetres (54 inches) in diameter. The frieze of the entablature is highly enriched, and in the tympanum of the pediment were the royal arms until removed following restoration in the 1920s. On the acroteria of the pediment are three statues by John Smyth: when facing the building Mercury on the left, with his Caduceus and purse; Fidelity on the right, with a hound at her feet and a key held in her right hand (due to these features it is argued that the statue is in fact of Hecate); and Hibernia in the centre, resting on her spear and holding a harp. The entablature, with the exception of the architrave, is continued along the rest of the front; the frieze, however, is not decorated over the portico. A balustrade surmounts the cornice of the building, which is 15.2 metres (50 ft) from the ground. With the exception of the portico, which is of Portland stone, the main building is of mountain granite. The elevation has three stories, of which the lower or basement is rusticated. The portico occupies the entire height of the structure. The GPO Arcade is an art deco style shopping arcade at the rear of the complex, with access from Henry Street and Princes Street North. It was built by the Office of Public Works following the Rising. Local radio station, Millennium 88FM was based here. History Gaelic script and using an older spelling that predates Irish orthography reforms of the 1960s. The General Post Office in Ireland was first located in High Street in Dublin moving to Fishamble Street in 1689, to Sycamore Alley in 1709 and then in 1755 to Bardin's Chocolate House on the site where the Commercial Buildings used to be (now the Central Bank building) off Dame Street. It was afterwards removed to a larger house opposite the Bank of Ireland building on College Green. On 6 January 1818, the new post-office in Sackville Street (now O'Connell Street) was opened for business. During the Easter Rising of 1916, the GPO served as the headquarters of the uprising's leaders. It was from outside this building on the 24th of April 1916, that Patrick Pearse read out the Proclamation of the Irish Republic. The building was destroyed by fire in the course of the rebellion, save for the granite facade, and not rebuilt until 1929, by the Irish Free State government. An original copy of the Proclamation of the Irish Republic was displayed in the museum at the GPO. The museum was closed at the end of May 2015 and replaced by a new visitor centre to commemorate the 1916 Rising, 'GPO Witness History', in March 2016. The building has remained a symbol of Irish nationalism. In commemoration of the Rising, a statue depicting the death of the mythical hero C√∫chulainn sculpted by Oliver Sheppard in 1911 was sited at the command post in the centre of the GPO main hall and is now housed in the front of the building. The statue was featured on the Irish ten shilling coin of 1966, marking the fiftieth anniversary of the Rising. Despite its fame as an iconic place of Irish freedom, ground rent for the GPO continued to be paid to English and American landlords until the 1980s. The broadcasting studios of 2RN, which later became Radio √âireann, were located at the GPO from 1928 until 1974. Draws for Prize Bonds are held weekly, on Fridays, in the building. Nelson's Pillar was located in the centre of O'Connell Street adjacent to the GPO, until it was destroyed by Irish republicans in an explosion in 1966. The Spire of Dublin was erected on the site of the Pillar in 2003.

He was a member of the Marx Brothers (with Groucho Marx, Harpo Marx, and Zeppo Marx). His persona in the act was that of a charming, uneducated but crafty con artist, seemingly of rural Italian origin, who wore shabby clothes and sported a curly-haired wig and Tyrolean hat. On screen, Chico is often in alliance with Harpo, usually as partners in crime, and is also frequently seen trying to con or outfox Groucho. Leonard was the oldest of the Marx Brothers to live past early childhood (first-born Manfred Marx had died in infancy). In addition to his work as a performer, he played an important role in the management and development of the act in its early years. Early years Chico was born in Manhattan, New York City, on March 22, 1887.During his lifetime, his year of birth had commonly been given as 1891 instead of the true year of 1887. As a result, obituaries reported his age at the time of his death as 70 rather than 74 His parents were Sam Marx (called \\"Frenchie\\" throughout his life), and his wife, Minnie Schoenberg Marx. Minnie's brother was Al Shean. The Marx family was Franco-German Jewish. His father was a native of Alsace who worked as a tailor and his mother was from East Frisia in Germany.La famille paternelle des Marx Brothers Viewed August 21, 2007. Billing himself as Chico, he used an Italian persona for his onstage character; stereotyped ethnic characters were common with vaudevillians. His non-Italian-ness was specifically referred to twice on film. In their second feature, Animal Crackers, he recognizes someone he knows to be a fish peddler impersonating a respected art collector: > Ravelli (Chico): \\"How is it you got to be Roscoe W. Chandler?\\" > Chandler: \\"Say, how did you get to be an Italian?\\" > Ravelli: \\"Never mind‚Äîwhose confession is this?\\" In A Night at the Opera, which begins in Italy, his character, Fiorello, claims not to be Italian, eliciting a surprised look from Groucho: > Driftwood (Groucho): \\"Well, things seem to be getting better around the > country.\\" > Fiorello (Chico): \\"I don't know, I'm a stranger here myself.\\" A scene in the film Go West, in which Chico attempts to placate an Indian chief of whom Groucho has run afoul, has a line that plays a bit on Chico's lack of Italian nationality, but is more or less proper Marxian wordplay: > S. Quentin Quayle (Groucho): \\"Can you talk Indian?\\" > Joe Panello (Chico): \\"I was born in Indianapolis!\\" There are moments, however, where Chico's characters appear to be genuinely Italian; examples include the film The Big Store, in which his character Ravelli runs into an old friend he worked with in Naples (after a brief misunderstanding due to his accent), the film Monkey Business, in which Chico claims his grandfather sailed with Christopher Columbus, and their very first outing The Cocoanuts, where Mr. Hammer (Groucho) asks him if he knew what an auction was, in which he responds \\"I come from Italy on the Atlantic Auction!\\" Chico's character is often assumed to be dim-witted, as he frequently misunderstands words spoken by other characters (particularly Groucho). However, he often gets the better of the same characters by extorting money from them, either by con or blackmail; again, Groucho is his most frequent target. Chico Marx playing cards with himself; taken at Rockaway Beach, New York, c. 1909 Chico was a talented pianist. He originally started playing with only his right hand and fake playing with his left, as his teacher did so herself. Chico eventually acquired a better teacher and learned to play the piano correctly. As a young boy, he gained jobs playing piano to earn money for the Marx family. Sometimes Chico even worked playing in two places at the same time. He would acquire the first job with his piano-playing skills, work for a few nights, and then substitute Harpo on one of the jobs. (During their boyhood, Chico and Harpo looked so much alike that they were often mistaken for each other.) In the brothers' last film, Love Happy, Chico plays a piano and violin duet with 'Mr. Lyons' (Leon Belasco). Lyons plays some ornate riffs on the violin; Chico comments, \\"Look-a, Mister Lyons, I know you wanna make a good impression, but please don't-a play better than me!\\" In a record album about the Marx Brothers, narrator Gary Owens stated that \\"although Chico's technique was limited, his repertoire was not.\\" The opposite was true of Harpo, who reportedly could play only two tunes on the piano, which typically thwarted Chico's scam and resulted in both brothers being fired. The Marx Brothers, from top: Chico, Harpo, Groucho, and Zeppo Marx Groucho Marx once said that Chico never practiced the pieces he played. Instead, before performances he soaked his fingers in hot water. He was known for 'shooting' the keys of the piano. He played passages with his thumb up and index finger straight, like a gun, as part of the act. Other examples of his keyboard flamboyance are found in A Night at the Opera (1935), where he plays the piano for a group of delighted children, and A Night in Casablanca (1946), where he performs a rendition of \\"The Beer Barrel Polka\\". Chico became the unofficial manager of the Marx Brothers after their mother, Minnie, died in 1929. As manager, he cut a deal to get the brothers a percentage of a film's gross receipts‚Äîthe first of its kind in Hollywood. Furthermore, it was Chico's connection with Irving Thalberg of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer that led to Thalberg's signing the Brothers when they were in a career slump after Duck Soup (1933), the last of their films for Paramount. For a while in the 1930s and 1940s, Chico led a big band. Singer Mel Torm√© began his professional career singing with the Chico Marx Orchestra. Through the 1950s, Chico occasionally appeared on a variety of television anthology shows and some television commercials, most memorably with Harpo in \\"The Incredible Jewelry Robbery\\", a pantomime episode of General Electric Theater in 1959. =Pronunciation and origin of name= ABC television comedy, The College Bowl. He played the role of a campus malt-shop owner who dispensed both sodas and advice to the students. His nickname (acquired during a card game in Chicago in 1915) was originally spelled Chicko. It was changed to Chico but still pronounced \\"Chick-oh\\" although those who were unaware of its origin tended to pronounce it \\"Cheek- oh\\". Numerous radio recordings from the 1940s exist where announcers and fellow actors mispronounce the nickname, but Chico apparently felt it was unnecessary to correct them. As late as the 1950s, Groucho was happy to use the wrong pronunciation for comedic effect. A guest on You Bet Your Life told the quizmaster she grew up around Chico (California) and Groucho responded, \\"I grew up around Chico myself. You aren't Gummo, are you?\\" Groucho is heard in videos pronouncing it \\"Chicko\\", as in a Dick Cavett episode with Groucho talking to Dan Rowan. During Groucho's live performance at Carnegie Hall in 1972, he states that his brother got the name Chico because he was a \\"chicken- chaser\\" (early 20th century slang for womanizer).Groucho Live At Carnegie Hall =Gambling= Harpo and Chico in \\"The Incredible Jewelry Robbery\\", a 1959 episode of General Electric Theater As well as being a compulsive womanizer, Chico had a lifelong gambling habit. His favorite gambling pursuits were card games, horse racing, dog racing, and various sports betting. His addiction cost him millions of dollars by his own account. When an interviewer in the late 1930s asked him how much money he had lost from gambling, he answered, \\"Find out how much money Harpo's got. That's how much I've lost.\\" Gummo Marx, in an interview years after Chico's death, said: \\"Chico's favorite people were actors who gambled, producers who gambled, and women who screwed.\\" Referring to Chico's love life, George Jessel quipped, \\"Chico didn't button his fly until he was seventy.\\"Bader, Robert S., Four of the Three Musketeers: The Marx Brothers On Stage, Northwestern University Press, 2017, pg. 132 Chico's lifelong gambling addiction compelled him to continue in show business long after his brothers had retired in comfort from their Hollywood income, and in the early 1940s he found himself playing in the same small, cheap halls in which he had begun his career 30 years earlier. The Marx Brothers' penultimate film, A Night in Casablanca (1946), was made for Chico's benefit since he had filed for bankruptcy a few years prior. Because of his out-of-control gambling, the brothers finally took the money as he earned it and put him on an allowance, on which he stayed until his death. Chico had a reputation as a world-class pinochle player, a game he and Harpo learned from their father. Groucho said Chico would throw away good cards (with the knowledge of spectators) to make the play \\"more interesting\\". Chico's last public appearance was in 1960, playing cards on the television show Championship Bridge. He and his partner lost the game. Personal life Chico was married twice. His first marriage was to Betty Karp in 1917. Their union produced one daughter named Maxine (1918‚Äì2009). His first marriage was plagued by his infidelity, ending in divorce in 1940; he was very close to his daughter Maxine and gave her acting lessons. Chico's second marriage was to Mary De Vithas. They married in 1958, three years before his death. Awards and honors In the 1974 Academy Awards telecast, Jack Lemmon presented Groucho with an honorary Academy Award to a standing ovation. The award was also for Harpo, Chico, and Zeppo, whom Lemmon mentioned by name. It was one of Groucho's final major public appearances. \\"I wish that Harpo and Chico could be here to share with me this great honor,\\" he said, naming the two deceased brothers (Zeppo was still alive at the time and in the audience). Groucho also praised the late Margaret Dumont as a great straight woman who never understood any of his jokes. Death Crypt Chico died of arteriosclerosis at age 74 on October 11, 1961, at his Hollywood home. He was the eldest brother and the first to die. Chico is entombed in the mausoleum at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. Chico's younger brother Gummo is in a crypt across the hall from him. Portrayals Many actors have portrayed Chico in stage revivals of Marx Brothers works, including Peter Slutsker, Les Marsden and Matt Roper.

It was released in August 1990 through Skene! Records. The name of the EP is a reference to the original name of the band. History The EP is a collection of some of the band's earliest songs that the band was still playing live at the time. It was recorded in 2 hours on July 5, 1990 at 6 ft Under in Minneapolis, Minnesota while the band was on a brief break from its summer tour,Green Day: The Complete History, Guitar Legends . Retrieved 2009-11-17 and released on seven-inch vinyl. The EP was released on Minneapolis-based indie label Skene! Records. These were the last recordings drummer John Kiffmeyer would contribute to the band. Shortly after the end of the tour, he left the band to attend college. Also of note, \\"My Generation\\" features a line from the film Blue Velvet: \\"Heineken? Fuck that shit!\\", said by the primary antagonist Frank Booth (although it's not the actual audio sample). Pressings There are five different pressings of the EP (some limited quantities included two different variations of red vinyl). The first four have been out of print since its inclusion on the CD issue of Green Day's second album Kerplunk in 1992. Because of this, it has since become a valuable and sought-after item among collectors and Green Day fans alike. The first pressing's cover is a picture of Mike Dirnt's leg during a concert. The second pressing's cover is a black and white picture of a somewhat trashed Volkswagen Beetle with the caption \\"What Do You Think Mike...\\" This rare second pressing, limited to 600 copies as opposed to the first run's respectable 1,500, also featured a handwritten insert, reading \\"Not a lyrics sheet, so don't get your hopes up\\". The third pressing is the same as the one above in every way except there is no insert, and the cover, instead of being black and white, is tinted red. The fourth pressing is a reissue, possibly from 1991, for it has a lengthy summary on the back which explains that the songs are also on Kerplunk. The cover is mostly blank, featuring only a picture of the band. On March 24, 2009, the EP was back in print as it was included with the vinyl reissue of Kerplunk. It is a reissue of the first pressing. In 1990, on the first day of the EP's release, it sold 493 copies.

A unified Irish proto-state had been coalescing from the multitude of small tribal kingdoms that existed circa AD 500, similar to the pattern elsewhere in Europe. The independent development of the several dynastic regional kingdoms into a nascent national kingdom, however, was extinguished by the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169, although these regional Gaelic Ireland kingdoms continued to resist for centuries until the Tudor conquest of Ireland was completed in the 17th century. This list deals with the various states that existed from 1171 onwards that owed their origin to Norman and later, English involvement on the island of Ireland. These were recognised by the Holy See before 1570 and after 1766. Until the whole island was subdued following the end of the Nine Years' War in 1603 these states shared the island of Ireland with a patchwork of indigenous states that existed outside of their authority.

Tino rangatiratanga is a MƒÅori language term that is often translated as \\"absolute sovereignty\\". It appears in the MƒÅori version of the Treaty of Waitangi, signed by the British Crown and MƒÅori chiefs (rangatira) in 1840. It has become one of the most contentious phrases in retrospective analyses of the Treaty amid debate surrounding the obligations that were agreed to by each signatory. The phrase features in current historical and political discourse on race relations in New Zealand and is widely used by MƒÅori advocacy groups. A flag based on tino rangatiratanga was designed in 1990 and has become accepted as a national flag for MƒÅori groups across New Zealand.  Origins and etymology  A rangatira is a chief, the nominalising suffix -tanga makes the word an abstract noun referring to the quality or attributes of chieftainship, and the addition of intensifier tino in this context means the phrase can be translated as 'highest chieftainship' (Kawharu, 1989, p. 314), the intention of which was to 'emphasize to a chief the Queen's intention to give the complete control according to their customs' (ibid., p. 319).Kawharu, I. H. (1989). Waitangi: MƒÅori and PƒÅkƒìha perspectives of the Treaty of Waitangi. Auckland, New Zealand: Oxford University Press. The term's English translation is 'absolute (tino) sovereignty (rangatiratanga)', although many also refer to it as self- determination,Awatere, D. (1982). Maori sovereignty. Broadsheet, 100, 38‚Äì42. autonomy, or MƒÅori independence. *Tino: absolute ... used before a noun to indicate something is unrivalled or is true or genuine. *Rangatiratanga: kingdom, realm, sovereignty, principality, self-determination, self- management.  Treaty of Waitangi  The emphasis on tino rangatiratanga draws from an inconsistency arising between Article 1 and Article 2 of the Treaty of Waitangi: *In the English text of Article 1 of the Treaty, the MƒÅori signatories cede their sovereignty to the British Crown. For the MƒÅori text, since there was no direct MƒÅori translation for the idea, the missionary neologism 'kawanatanga' (= 'governorship') was used to represent the concept of sovereignty. That word was based on the transliteration \\"Kawana\\" (= 'governor'), which had been invented by Bible translators to explain Pontius Pilate's authority in Judaea. Kawana had also been used prior to 1840 to describe the Governor of New South Wales. *In the English text of Article 2, signatories are assured that the full exclusive and undisturbed possession of their Lands and Estates Forests Fisheries and other properties would remain for so long as they chose. In the MƒÅori text, signatories are assured that their tino rangatiratanga will remain undisturbed over their lands, kainga and other taonga (te tino rangatiratanga o ratou wenua o ratou kainga me o ratou taonga katoa, literally the absolute chieftainship of your lands, your homes, and all your treasures/taonga). Based on the MƒÅori text alone, in Article 1, the signatories appear to be granting kawanatanga (governorship), and in Article 2, the signatories are promised that their tino rangatiratanga (absolutely sovereignty or highest chieftainship) would remain undisturbed. The apparent inconsistency led to much debate as to whether the MƒÅori signatories intended to cede their sovereignty to the British Crown at all: a debate now definitively resolved by the Waitangi Tribunal ruling that sovereignty was not (indeed could not) be ceded . Aside from the legal controversy, many MƒÅori see the Treaty as a charter to choose their own way of life within the framework of law, free of external interference in taonga like language and culture. Flag Protester with the Tino Rangatiratanga flag at a protest hikoi against the foreshore and seabed bill in 2004. The Tino Rangatiratanga flag is often referred to as the MƒÅori flag and can be used to represent all MƒÅori. Hiraina Marsden, Jan Smith and Linda Munn designed the flag in 1990. It uses black, white, and red as national colours of New Zealand. The design of the flag references the MƒÅori creation story of Rangi and Papa, suggesting the sky, the earth, and the physical realm of light and being, which was created when they were separated. The official recognition of the Tino Rangatiratanga flag resulted from a campaign by indigenous rights advocacy group Te Ata Tino Toa. The group applied for the Tino Rangatiratanga flag to fly on the Auckland Harbour Bridge on Waitangi Day. Transit New Zealand, the government agency that was responsible for the bridge, declined on the basis that the flag did not represent a country recognised by the United Nations. After considerable debate in the public arena, the group adopted diverse tactics to raise awareness of the issues, including lobbying Transit NZ and Parliament, submissions to the Human Rights Commission and holding an annual 'Fly the Flag' competition, to more direct protest actions including bungee jumping off the Harbour Bridge, traffic jamming the Harbour Bridge, and flying the largest Tino Rangatiratanga flag ever made over the Harbour Bridge. Key organisers of the campaign included Tia Taurere, Gareth Seymour and Teanau Tuiono. On 14 December 2009, Prime Minister John Key and MƒÅori Affairs Minister Pita Sharples announced that the MƒÅori Tino Rangatiratanga flag was chosen to fly from the Auckland Harbour Bridge and other official buildings (such as Premier House) on Waitangi Day. The announcement followed a MƒÅori Party‚Äìled promotion and series of hui on which MƒÅori flag should fly from the bridge. 1,200 submissions were received, with 80% of participants in favour of the Tino Rangatiratanga flag as they preferred the MƒÅori flag. Key said the MƒÅori flag would not replace the New Zealand flag but would fly alongside it to recognise the partnership the Crown and MƒÅori entered into when signing the Treaty of Waitangi. \\"No changes are being made to the status of the New Zealand flag,\\" Mr Key said. Monarchy New Zealand said the move would be \\"potentially divisive\\" and AUT University Doctor Paul Moon was critical of the move. Sharples said the MƒÅori flag was a simple way to recognise the status of MƒÅori as tangata whenua (people of the land). \\"However, the New Zealand flag remains the symbol of our nation, and there is no intention to change this, nor to diminish the status of our national flag.\\" The Ministry of Culture and Heritage published guidelines describing the appropriate way to fly the MƒÅori flag in relation to the New Zealand flag.

Primarily in New Zealand, but also in places with large numbers of expatriate New Zealanders (such as London and Melbourne), the movement aims to increase the use of MƒÅori in the home, in education, government and business. The movement is part of a broader MƒÅori renaissance. Until World War II (1939‚Äì1945) most MƒÅori people spoke MƒÅori as their first language but by the 1980s fewer than 20 per cent of MƒÅori spoke the language well enough to be classed as native speakers. The causes of the decline included the switch from using MƒÅori to using English compulsorily in schools and increasing urbanisation, which disconnected younger generations from their extended families and in particular their grandparents, who traditionally played a large part in family life. Even many of those people no longer spoke MƒÅori in the home. As a result, many MƒÅori children failed to learn their ancestral language, and generations of non-MƒÅori-speaking MƒÅori emerged. In response, MƒÅori leaders initiated MƒÅori-language recovery-programs such as the K≈çhanga Reo (\\"language nests\\") movement, which from 1982 immersed infants in MƒÅori from infancy to school age. In 1989 official support was given for Kura Kaupapa MƒÅori‚Äîprimary and secondary MƒÅori-language immersion schools. MƒÅori Language Week A government-sponsored initiative, , MƒÅori Language Week, has been celebrated since 1975 and is intended to encourage New Zealanders to support te reo MƒÅori. MƒÅori Language Act 1987 and the MƒÅori Language Commission The MƒÅori Language Act 1987 was passed as a response to the Waitangi Tribunal finding that the MƒÅori language was a taonga, a treasure or valued possession, under the Treaty of Waitangi. The Act gave te reo MƒÅori official-language status, and gave speakers a right to use it in legal settings such as in court. It also established the MƒÅori Language Commission (initially called Te Komihana Mo Te Reo MƒÅori but later renamed Te Taura Whiri i Te Reo MƒÅori) to promote the language and provide advice on it. K≈çhanga Reo K≈çhanga Reo () is a whƒÅnau (family) development and language- revitalisation initiative grounded in MƒÅori cultural principles and ideals. It facilitates the growth and development of mokopuna (grandchildren) through the transmission of MƒÅori language, knowledge and culture. The k≈çhanga reo movement operates from the MƒÅori philosophical world view and is principally guided by kaumƒÅtua (respected elders). Individual K≈çhanga Reo are autonomously run by their respective whƒÅnau, which consists of a \\"collective group of teachers, parents, local elders, and members of the MƒÅori community\\".King, Jeanette. 2001.

While funded by governmental quarterly grants from the Te K≈çhanga Reo National Trust, K≈çhanga Reo often also charge additional fees to cover operational costs. These fees, determined by each whƒÅnau, are generally comparable to or less expensive than traditional child- care. King, Jeanette. 2001. Te k≈çhanga reo: MƒÅori language revitalization. In The green book of language revitalization in practice, ed. Leanne Hinton and Ken Hale, 119‚Äì128. New York: Academic Press. Conducted entirely in te reo MƒÅori, a k≈çhanga reo is an environment where 0‚Äì6-year-olds,Schooling is compulsory from age 6 in New Zealand kaumƒÅtua and whƒÅnau spend time together talking, playing, praying and learning. Daily activities may take place anywhere that is safe and warm including marae (traditional community meeting places), converted homes or purpose-built centres. Emerging in the late 1970s at the direction of kaumƒÅtua, k≈çhanga reo was an immediate and urgent response to the decline of te reo MƒÅori (MƒÅori language) and tikanga MƒÅori (MƒÅori culture, cultural habits and practices). Jean Puketapu and Iritana Tawhiwhirangi were among the early leaders when the first k≈çhanga reo was founded in Wainuiomata in 1982. Three years later there were over 300 operating. The success of k≈çhanga reo is such that they have been followed by the establishment of primary schools and secondary schools (Kura Kaupapa MƒÅori) where MƒÅori is the primary language of instruction. The role of Maori language in education in New Zealand is enshrined in the Education Act 1989.Education Act 1989 The k≈çhanga reo concept has led to other before-school initiatives in New Zealand that instruct in Pacific languages, e.g. Fijian, Rarotongan, Samoan, and Tongan and other countries adopting a similar concept. A notable example being P≈´nana Leo established in Hawaii to revitalise the indigenous Hawaiian language. Politics Election campaigns by the MƒÅori Party often feature increased roles for reo MƒÅori. In the 2011 election, the party wanted to require that all secondary schools offer the language as an option to every student.

The RƒÅtana Church has its headquarters at the settlement of RƒÅtana PƒÅ near Whanganui. In 2001 the total number of New Zealand residents that were affiliated with the RƒÅtana church was 48,975.According to the NZ Census 2001, RƒÅtana Star  Symbols  The main symbol (tohu) of the church is a five-pointed star and crescent moon, the whet≈´ mƒÅrama (which means both \\"star and moon\\" and \\"shining star\\"), which is worn on the lapels of m≈çrehu (the scattered remnant, RƒÅtana followers) and at pivotal points on church buildings. The golden or blue crescent moon (symbolising enlightenment) can face different parts of the coloured star: blue represents Te Matua (The Father), white is Te Tama (The Son), red is Te Wairua Tapu (The Holy Spirit), purple is NgƒÅ Anahera Pono (The Faithful Angels) and gold/yellow is Te MƒÅngai (The Mouthpiece (of Jehovah), Ture Wairua), although this colour is sometimes substituted for the colour pink, representing PiriWiriTua (The Campaigner (of Political Matters), Ture Tangata). Te Whet≈´ MƒÅrama represents the kingdom of light or MƒÅramatanga, standing firm against the forces of darkness (mƒÅkutu).  Ture Wairua (spiritual mission)  On 8 November 1918 RƒÅtana saw a vision, which he regarded as divinely inspired, asking him to preach the gospel to the MƒÅori people, to destroy the power of the tohunga, and to cure the spirits and bodies of his people. Until 1924 he preached to increasingly large numbers of MƒÅori and established a name for himself as the \\"MƒÅori Miracle Man\\". At first, the movement was seen as a Christian revival, but it soon moved away from mainstream churches. On 31 May 1925, Te Haahi RƒÅtana (the RƒÅtana Church) was established as a separate church and its founder was acknowledged as the bearer of Te Mangai or God's Word and Wisdom. On 21 July 1925, the constitution of the RƒÅtana Church was accepted by the Registrar-General and a list of 'apostles' (ministers) who were authorised to conduct marriages was published in the New Zealand Gazette. Hostile attitudes have caused the church to be guarded towards its teaching and founder.  Ture Tangata (secular movement)  The RƒÅtana Church is made up of the Ture Wairua (spiritual laws) and the Ture Tangata (physical laws). The spiritual laws are itemised as the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit (in Maori, Te Matua, Te Tama me Te Wairua Tapu), and NgƒÅ Anahera Pono (the Holy and Faithful Angels) and also adding Te MƒÅngai (God's Word and Wisdom) to prayers. Its central book is the Bible, although the Blue Book, written in MƒÅori and containing prayers and hymns (many composed by RƒÅtana), is used in all church services. In order that these things should become manifest, a price was paid by the sons of Tahupotiki Wiremu RƒÅtana: Te Arepa, Te Omeka, PiriWiriTua, and Hamuera. RƒÅtana said he would divide his body into four parts: in the West was Te Arepa, in the South was Te Omeka, in the North was PiriWiriTua, and in the East was Hamuera. These names represented the four seats that Maori were allowed to vote for. Eruera Tirikatene won Southern Maori as a Ratana candidate in a 1932 by election. Toko Ratana won Western Maori as a Ratana candidate in 1935 election. Paraire Karaka Paikea and Tiaki Omana as Ratana endorsed Labour candidates won Northern Maori in 1938 and Eastern Maori in 1943 respectively. Te Mangai is spirit, and His kaupapa was the spiritual laws, which were supported and endorsed by his chosen people‚Äîthe Morehu. The Morehu determined that they should support and endorse RƒÅtana. The right was given by Ihoa (Jehovah). PiriWiriTua carried the kaupapa, which was to address the sicknesses of the land, the RƒÅtana movement. He needed Maori to be united for the Treaty to become entrenched into law. From the treaty comes the laws of man: two people but one land. Te Temepara Tapu o Ihoa at RƒÅtana PƒÅ, 2012 In 1924 a group including RƒÅtana journeyed to Europe to unsuccessfully present a petition to George V and the League of Nations on land confiscations and the Treaty of Waitangi. Later trips were made to the U.S. and Canada. These trips were not without controversy. The New Zealand Government acted to prevent the petition being presented to the monarch, and the visit to Japan on the way back from Europe created allegations of disloyalty and of flying the Japanese flag over the church settlement of RƒÅtana PƒÅ. When the RƒÅtana temple (Te Temepara Tapu o Ihoa (The Holy Temple of Jehovah)) which Ratana saw as embodying in its architecture deep Biblical truths (especially the two magnificent bell towers) was opened on 25 January 1928 by Japanese Bishop Juji Nakada (with whom Ratana and party had stayed in 1924), RƒÅtana declared his spiritual work was complete and church apostles and officers would take on the work. He now turned more to political work for Maori in New Zealand. Calling himself Piri Wiri Tua (the campaigner), he called the four seats in Parliament reserved for MƒÅori the koata (quarters) of his body. This term is from the Maori language and was applied to each of the four New Zealand Maori seats and to the RƒÅtana movement Members of Parliament (MP) who held them.  Koata (political movement)  As early as 1923, RƒÅtana had declared an interest in party politics, and his eldest son Haami Tokouru RƒÅtana had stood for the Western Maori electorate as an independent candidate. Now RƒÅtana was determined to capture the MƒÅori electorates to give a voice for his movement. In January 1928, RƒÅtana called himself Piri Wiri Tua and called on four followers to be the quarters of his body and rule the land. The \\"first cut\\" was Paraire Karaka Paikea in the north, Haami Tokouru RƒÅtana in the west, Pita Moko in the east, and Eruera Tirikatene in the south. Moko was later replaced by Tiaki Omana, in the \\"second cut\\". The covenant signed by the men promised they would not rest, and their wives separately agreed that they would go barefoot and in rags to represent the RƒÅtana movement. All four went on to capture the Maori seats between 1932 and 1943. RƒÅtana candidates stood in the 1928 and 1931 general elections and in the 1930 by-election in Western Maori following the death of Maui Pomare, but they did not succeed. The first RƒÅtana movement MP was Eruera Tirikatene, elected in a by-election for Southern Maori in June 1932. He was followed by Haami Tokouru RƒÅtana (known as Toko) in Western Maori in the 1935 general election. In the 1938 election, the third MƒÅori electorate of Northern Maori was captured by Paraire Karaka Paikea, and the last (Eastern Maori) was won by Tiaki Omana in the 1943 election. The RƒÅtana Independent Members of Parliament were the first to represent a political party in which most party members were MƒÅori. Major aims of the movement were statutory recognition of the Treaty of Waitangi, righting the confiscation grievances of the MƒÅori people, and equality in social welfare for MƒÅori.  Alliance with the Labour Party  Following the formation of the First Labour Government in 1935, the two RƒÅtana MPs agreed to vote with Labour. This alliance was formalised with the RƒÅtana movement joining the Labour Party in a meeting between RƒÅtana and Prime Minister Michael Savage on 22 April 1936. The Prime Minister was given four symbolic gifts: a potato, a broken gold watch, a pounamu hei-tiki, and a huia feather. The potato represented loss of MƒÅori land and means of sustenance, the broken watch represented the broken promises of the Treaty of Waitangi, and the pounamu represented the mana of the MƒÅori people. If Savage could restore these three, he would earn the right to wear the huia feather to signify his chiefly status. The gifts were regarded as so precious they were buried with Savage at his state funeral in 1940. The four MƒÅori electorates were held by RƒÅtana-affiliated members of Labour for decades: until 1963 for the Eastern Maori electorate, 1980 for Northern Maori, and 1996 for Western and Southern Maori electorates. RƒÅtana movement Members of Parliament have included Tapihana Paraire Paikea, Haami Tokouru RƒÅtana, Matiu RƒÅtana, Iriaka RƒÅtana, Koro Wƒìtere, Paraone Reweti, Matiu Rata, and Whetu Tirikatene- Sullivan. Mita Ririnui, who was a List MP as of 2006 and who held the MƒÅori seat of Waiariki from 1999 to 2005, is a RƒÅtana minister.  Importance in New Zealand politics  RƒÅtana church near Raetihi In both the parliaments of 1946‚Äì1948 and of 1957‚Äì1960, the formation of a Labour Government depended on the votes of the RƒÅtana Movement members. Not all Labour Party MƒÅori MPs have been members of the RƒÅtana Church, but the alliance with RƒÅtana allowed Labour to hold on to all four MƒÅori electorates from the 1940s until 1996.

An instance variable has similarities with a class variable, but is non-static. An instance variable is a variable which is declared in a class but outside of constructors, methods, or blocks. Instance variables are created when an object is instantiated, and are accessible to all the constructors, methods, or blocks in the class. Access modifiers can be given to the instance variable. An instance variable is not a class variable although there are similarities. It is a type of class attribute (or class property, field, or data member). The same dichotomy between instance and class members applies to methods (\\"member functions\\") as well; a class may have both instance methods and class methods. Each instance variable lives in memory for the life of the object it is owned by. Variables are properties an object knows about itself. All instances of an object have their own copies of instance variables, even if the value is the same from one object to another. One object instance can change values of its instance variables without affecting all other instances. Instance variables can be used by all methods of a class unless the method is declared as static. Example struct Request { static int count1; // variable name is not important int number; Request() { number = count1; // modifies the instance variable \\"this->number\\" ++count1; // modifies the class variable \\"Request::count1\\" } }; int Request::count1 = 0; In this C++ example, the instance variable \`Request::number\` is a copy of the class variable \`Request::count1\` where each instance constructed is assigned a sequential value of \`count1\` before it is incremented. Since \`number\` is an instance variable, each \`Request\` object contains its own distinct value; in contrast, there is only one object \`Request::count1\` available to all instances with the same value.

It is distinct from auctoritas and potestas, different and generally inferior types of power in the Roman Republic and Empire. One's imperium could be over a specific military unit, or it could be over a province or territory. Individuals given such power were referred to as curule magistrates or promagistrates. These included the curule aedile, the praetor, the consul, the magister equitum, and the dictator. In a general sense, imperium was the scope of someone's power, and could include anything, such as public office, commerce, political influence, or wealth.  Personal characteristic  In ancient Rome, imperium could be used as a term indicating a characteristic of people, the wealth held in items, or the measure of formal power they had. This qualification could be used in a rather loose context (for example, poets used it, not necessarily writing about state officials). However, in Roman society, it was also a more formal concept of legal authority. A man with imperium (\\"imperator\\") had, in principle, absolute authority to apply the law within the scope of his magistracy or promagistracy. He could be vetoed or overruled either by a magistrate or promagistrate who was a colleague with equal power (e.g. a fellow consul) or by one whose imperium outranked his - that is, one of imperium maius (greater imperium). Some modern scholars such as A.H.M. Jones have defined imperium as \\"the power vested by the state in a person to do what he considers to be in the best interests of the state\\". Imperium can be distinguished from regnum, or royal power, which was inherited. Imperium was originally a military concept, the power of the imperator (general in the army) to command. The word derives from the Latin verb, imperare (to command). The title imperator was applied to the emperor, who was the commander of the armed forces. In fact, the Latin word, imperator, gives us the English word \\"emperor\\". Imperium was indicated in two prominent ways. A curule magistrate or promagistrate carried an ivory baton surmounted by an eagle as his personal symbol of office (compare the field marshal's baton). Any such magistrate was also escorted by lictors bearing the fasces (traditional symbols of imperium and authority); when outside the pomerium, axes were added to the fasces to indicate an imperial magistrate's power to enact capital punishment outside Rome (the axes were removed within the pomerium). The number of lictors in attendance upon a magistrate was an overt indication of the degree of imperium. When in the field, a curule magistrate possessing an imperium greater or equal to that of a praetor wore a sash ritually knotted on the front of his cuirass. Further, any man executing imperium within his sphere of influence was entitled to the curule chair. * Curule aedile (aedilis curulis) ‚Äì 2 lictors ** Since a plebeian aedile (aedilis plebis) did not own imperium, he was not escorted by lictors. * Magister equitum (the dictator's deputy) ‚Äì 6 lictors * Praetor ‚Äì 6 lictors (2 lictors within the pomerium) * Consul ‚Äì 12 lictors each * Dictator ‚Äì 24 lictors outside the Pomerium and 12 inside; starting from the dictatorship of Lucius Sulla the latter rule was ignored. ** Because the dictator could enact capital punishment within Rome as well as without, his lictors did not remove the axes from their fasces within the pomerium. As can be seen, dictatorial imperium was superior to consular, consular to praetorian, and praetorian to aedilician; there is some historical dispute as to whether or not praetorian imperium was superior to \\"equine-magisterial\\" imperium. A promagistrate, or a man executing a curule office without actually holding that office, also possessed imperium in the same degree as the actual incumbents (i.e., proconsular imperium being more or less equal to consular imperium, propraetorian imperium to praetorian) and was attended by an equal number of lictors. Certain extraordinary commissions, such as Pompey's famous command against the pirates, were invested with imperium maius meaning they outranked all other owners of imperium of the same type or rank (in Pompey's case, even the consuls) within their sphere of command (his being \\"ultimate on the seas, and within 50 miles inland\\"). Imperium maius later became a hallmark of the Roman emperor. Another technical use of the term in Roman law was for the power to extend the law beyond its mere interpretation, extending imperium from formal legislators under the ever-republican constitution: popular assemblies, senate, magistrates, emperor and their delegates to the jurisprudence of jurisconsults. Later While the Byzantine Eastern Roman Emperors retained full Roman imperium and made the episcopate subservient, in the feudal West a long rivalry would oppose the claims to supremacy within post-Roman Christianity between sacerdotium in the person of the Pope and the secular imperium of the Holy Roman Emperor beginning with Charlemagne, whose title was claimed to have \\"restored\\" the office of Western Roman Emperor among the new kingdoms of Western Europe. Both would refer to the heritage of Roman law by their titular link with the very city Rome: the Pope, Bishop of Rome, versus the Holy Roman Emperor (even though his seat of power was north of the Alps). The Donatio Constantini, by which the Papacy had allegedly been granted the territorial Patrimonium Petri in Central Italy, became a weapon against the Emperor. The first pope who used it in an official act and relied upon it, Leo IX, cites the \\"Donatio\\" in a letter of 1054 to Michael C√¶rularius, Patriarch of Constantinople, to show that the Holy See possessed both an earthly and a heavenly imperium, the royal priesthood. Thenceforth the \\"Donatio\\" acquires more importance and is more frequently used as evidence in the ecclesiastical and political conflicts between the papacy and the secular power: Anselm of Lucca and Cardinal Deusdedit inserted it in their collections of canons; Gratian excluded it from his Decretum, but it was soon added to it as Palea; the ecclesiastical writers in defence of the papacy during the conflicts of the early part of the 12th century quoted it as authoritative. In one bitter episode, Pope Gregory IX who had several times mediated between the Lombards and the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II reasserted his right to arbitrate between the contending parties. In the numerous manifestos of the Pope and the Emperor the antagonism between Church and State became more evident: the Pope claimed for himself the imperium animarum 'command of the souls' (i.e. voicing God's will to the faithful) and the principatus rerum et corporum in universo mundo 'princedom over all things and bodies in the whole world', while the Emperor wished to restore the imperium mundi, imperium (as under Roman Law) over the (now Christian) world ‚Äî Rome was again to be the capital of the world and Frederick was to become the real emperor of the Romans, so he energetically protested against the authority of the Pope. The emperor's successes, especially his victory over the Lombards at the battle of Cortenuova (1237), only embittered the opposition between Church and State. The pope again excommunicated the \\"self-confessed heretic\\", the \\"blasphemous beast of the Apocalypse\\" (20 March 1239) who now attempted to conquer the rest of Italy, i.e. the papal states, et cetera.  Divine and earthly imperium  In some monotheistic religions such as Christianity (the Catholic Church where the official language, Latin, used terms as Imperium Dei/Domini) the Divine is held to have a superior imperium, as ultimate King of Kings, above all earthly powers. Whenever a society accepts this Divine will to be expressed on earth, as by a religious authority, this can lead to theocratic legitimation. However, the Catholic Church and most other Christian groups acknowledge the authority of secular governments. If however, a secular ruler controls the religious hierarchy, he can use it to legitimize his own authority. Thus absolute, universal power was vested under early Islam in the original Caliphate, and later again claimed by Mahdis. The chief minister of Henry VIII, the Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer suggested removal of the Roman Catholic papacy's imperium in imperio (Latin for \\"state within a state\\") by requesting that Parliament pass the Act in Restraint of Appeals (1533) specifying that England was an empire and that The Crown was imperial, and a year later the Act of Supremacy proclaiming the Imperial Crown Protector and Supreme Head of the Church of England. In Orthodox Russia too, when Peter I the Great assumed the Byzantine imperial titles Imperator and Autokrator, instead of the royal Tsar, the idea in founding the Russian Holy Synod was to put an end to the old Imperium in imperio of the free Church, by substituting the synod for the all too independent Patriarch of Moscow, which had become almost a rival of the Tsars ‚Äî Peter meant to unite all authority in himself, over Church as well as State: through his Ober-Procurator and synod, the Emperor ruled his Church as absolutely as the military through their respective ministries; he appointed its members just as he did generals; and the Russian Government continued his policy until the end of the empire in 1917.

Oregon, 208 U.S. 412 (1908), was a landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court.. Women were provided by state mandate lesser work-hours than allotted to men. The posed question was whether women's liberty to negotiate a contract with an employer should be equal to a man's. The law did not recognize sex-based discrimination in 1908; it was unrecognized until the case of Reed v. Reed in 1971; here, the test was not under the equal protections clause, but a test based on the general police powers of the state to protect the welfare of women when it infringed on her fundamental right to negotiate contracts; inequality was not a deciding factor because the sexes were inherently different in their particular conditions and had completely different functions;Muller, 208 U.S. at 423. usage of labor laws that were made to nurture women's welfare and for the \\"benefit of all\\" peopleMuller, 208 U.S. at 422. was decided to be not a violation of the Constitution's Contract Clause.

The quotes for the decision follows: \\"woman has always been dependent upon man.\\"Muller, 208 U.S. at 421. \\"in the struggle for subsistence she is not an equal competitor with her brother.\\" \\"Though limitations upon personal and contractual rights may be removed by legislation, there is that in her disposition and habits of life which will operate against a full assertion of those rights.\\" \\"her physical structure and a proper discharge of her maternal functions ‚Äî having in view not merely her own health, but the well-being of the race ‚Äî justify legislation to protect her from the greed as well as the passion of man.\\" \\"The limitations which this statute places upon her contractual powers, upon her right to agree with her employer as to the time she shall labor, are not imposed solely for her benefit, but also largely for the benefit of all.\\" The ruling had important implications for protective labor legislation and was decided just three years after Lochner v. New York,. in which a New York law restricting the weekly working hours of bakers in the state was invalidated. Background Curt Muller, the owner of a laundry business, was convicted of violating Oregon labor laws by making a female employee work more than ten hours in a single day. Muller was fined $10. Muller appealed to the Oregon Supreme Court and then to the U.S. Supreme Court, both of which upheld the constitutionality of the labor law and affirmed his conviction. Judgment In Justice David Josiah Brewer's unanimous opinion, the Court upheld the Oregon regulation. The Court did not overrule Lochner, but instead distinguished it on the basis of \\"the difference between the sexes\\". The child-bearing physiology and social role of women provided a strong state interest in reducing their working hours. > That woman's physical structure and the performance of maternal functions > place her at a disadvantage in the struggle for subsistence is obvious.

Her brother-in-law, the future Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis, argued the case in the U.S. Supreme Court. Goldmark and Brandeis's innovation would come to be known as a \\"Brandeis Brief,\\" and many others would later be modeled on it.\\"415 Protecting Women Wage-Workers, Women's America, Refocusing the Past.

Significance of the case  Groups like the National Consumer League (which included Florence Kelley and Josephine Goldmark as feminists) and the state won shorter hours for women. However, many equal-rights feminists opposed the ruling, since it allowed laws based on stereotyped gender roles that restricted women's rights and financial independence. While it provided protection from long hours to white women, it did not extend to women of color, food processors, agricultural workers, and women who worked in white- collar jobs. The government interest in public welfare outweighed the freedom of contract that is displayed in the 14th Amendment and the effects of Muller v. Oregon did not change until the New Deal days in the 1930s. It was also a watershed in the development of maternalist reforms.Brandeis, L. D. (1907). The Brandeis Brief--in its entirety.

Mothers of a New World, Maternalist Politics and the Origins of Welfare States (). Routledge. The ruling was criticized because it set a precedent to use sex differences, and in particular women's child-bearing capacity, as a basis for separate legislation, supporting the idea that the family has priority over women's rights as workers. Feminist Scholars such as Alice Kessler-Harris opposed the ruling as \\"an attack on women as workers\\" cloaked in altruistic labor laws. Kessler-Harris recognized the admirable motives of the period's protective labor laws but also observed that the Muller case provided justification for not just regulating but possibly prohibiting women from working in certain capacities. Moreover, the case supported a definition of women in society that according to Joan Hoff was \\"highly traditional and restrictive.\\" While many of the criticisms of Muller came by scholars in later decades there were some critics at the time of its ruling. One such critic was suffragist and editor of the Rose City Woman's' Tribune Clara Colby who commented two years before the case was decided: \\"the whole subject is very difficult and it had better be left to woman's own judgement as to what is necessary and desirable. The State has no right to lay any disability upon woman as an individual and if it does as a mother, it should give her a maternity pension which would tend to even up conditions and be better for the family.\\" \\"Until the late 1930s, when the Fair Labor Standards Act created gender-neutral workplace protections, the Equal Rights Amendment championed by the NWP would have demolished the gains for women workers won in Muller. This dispute between feminists who valued protection and feminists who valued equality continued until the latter group gained the upper hand in the 1970s.\\"\\"Muller v.

The symbol has continued to be used in modern times, where it is associated with medicine and health care, yet frequently confused with the staff of the god Hermes, the caduceus. Theories have been proposed about the Greek origin of the symbol and its implications. Greek mythology and Greek society The Rod of Asclepius takes its name from the Greek god Asclepius, a deity associated with healing and medicinal arts in Greek mythology. Asclepius' attributes, the snake and the staff, sometimes depicted separately in antiquity, are combined in this symbol.See for example Pausanias, Description of Greece 2.26.1‚Äì28.1 (here translated by Jones) 2nd A.D.: \\"The image of Asklepios is, in size, half as big as Zeus Olympios at Athens, and is made of ivory and gold. An inscription tells us that the artist was Thrasymedes, a Parian, son of Arignotos. The god is sitting on a seat grasping a staff; the other hand he is holding above the head of the serpent.\\" The most famous temple of Asclepius was at Epidaurus in north-eastern Peloponnese. Another famous healing temple (or asclepeion) was located on the island of Kos, where Hippocrates, the legendary \\"father of medicine\\", may have begun his career. Other asclepieia were situated in Trikala, Gortys (Arcadia), and Pergamum in Asia. In honor of Asclepius, a particular type of non-venomous snake was often used in healing rituals, and these snakes ‚Äì the Aesculapian snakes ‚Äì crawled around freely on the floor in dormitories where the sick and injured slept. These snakes were introduced at the founding of each new temple of Asclepius throughout the classical world. From about 300 BCE onwards, the cult of Asclepius grew very popular and pilgrims flocked to his healing temples (Asclepieia) to be cured of their ills. Ritual purification would be followed by offerings or sacrifices to the god (according to means), and the supplicant would then spend the night in the holiest part of the sanctuary ‚Äì the abaton (or adyton). Any dreams or visions would be reported to a priest who would prescribe the appropriate therapy by a process of interpretation.Sigerist. Chapter 3, Religious medicine: Asclepius and his cult, p. 63ff. Some healing temples also used sacred dogs to lick the wounds of sick petitioners.Farnell, Chapter 10, \\"The Cult of Asklepios\\" (pp. 234‚Äì279) The original Hippocratic Oath began with the invocation \\"I swear by Apollo the Healer and by Asclepius and by Hygieia and Panacea and by all the gods ...\\" The serpent and the staff appear to have been separate symbols that were combined at some point in the development of the Asclepian cult.Stephen Lock, John M. Last, George Dunea, The Oxford Illustrated Companion To Medicine, 2001, p261 \\"In early statues of Asclepius the rod and serpent were represented separately.\\" The significance of the serpent has been interpreted in many ways; sometimes the shedding of skin and renewal is emphasized as symbolizing rejuvenation,\\"Asklepios' reptile was a healing creature: in ancient mythology the snake, whose skin was shed and rejuvenated, symbolized eternity and restoration of life and health\\" Albert R. Jonsen, The New Medicine and the Old Ethics, Harvard University Press, 1990, p122; this interpretation was current in Antiquity, as can be seen in an account of Apollodorus: \\"your marvel at the serpent curling around him and say that it is the symbol of the healing art, because just as the serpent sloughs the skin of old age, so the medical art releases from illness.\\" (in E. Edelstein and L. Edelstein (eds.), Asclepius: A Collection and Interpretation of the Testimonies, Baltimore, 1945, p12) while other assessments center on the serpent as a symbol that unites and expresses the dual nature of the work of the Apothecary Physician, who deals with life and death, sickness and health.\\"[...] the ancient conception of the serpent as the embodiment of the mystery of one absolute life of the earth, which entails a continual dying and resurrection [...] the combination of corruption and salvation, of darkness and light, of good and evil in the Asklepian symbol.\\" Jan Schouten, The Rod and Serpent of Asklepios, Symbol of Medicine, 1967, p2 The ambiguity of the serpent as a symbol, and the contradictions it is thought to represent, reflect the ambiguity of the use of drugs,Albert R. Jonsen, The New Medicine and the Old Ethics, Harvard University Press, 1990, p122-123 which can help or harm, as reflected in the meaning of the term pharmakon, which meant \\"drug\\", \\"medicine\\", and \\"poison\\" in ancient Greek.Henry E. Sigerist, A History of Medicine, Oxford University Press, 1987, p27-28 Products deriving from the bodies of snakes were known to have medicinal properties in ancient times, and in ancient Greece, at least some were aware that snake venom that might be fatal if it entered the bloodstream could often be imbibed. Snake venom appears to have been 'prescribed' in some cases as a form of therapy.James A. Kelhoffer, Miracle and Mission, Mohr Siebeck, 2000, p438-439 \\"[...] it was known, at least by some people in antiquity, that a snake's venom is not harmful if imbibed, but rather only if it enters directly into a person's blood stream. For example, the first-century CE historian Lucan writes that the younger Cato, when leading his troops through Libya during the Roman Civil War, informed his men about this very point [...] 'The poison of snakes is only deadly when mixed with the blood; their venom is in their bite, and they threaten death with their fangs. There is no death in the cup.'\\" He also mentions an account of Cornelius Celsus (first century CE) \\"'For a serpent's poison, like certain hunter's poisons..., does no harm when swallowed, but only in a wound'\\". \\"Likewise, Galen relates a rather peculiar healing by Asclepius involving viper's venom. The god appeared to a wealthy man in Pergamum and prescribed 'that he should drink every day of the drug produced from the vipers and should anoint the body from the outside.' [...] The elder Philostratus describes a similar practice of 'the wise Asclepiads,' who 'heal the bites of venomous creatures... using the virus itself as a cure of many diseases.'\\" The staff has also been variously interpreted. One view is that it, like the serpent, \\"conveyed notions of resurrection and healing\\", while another (not necessarily incompatible) is that the staff was a walking stick associated with itinerant physicians.Andre Menez, The Subtle Beast, Snakes From Myth to Medicine, 2003, p14 Cornutus, a Greek philosopher probably active in the first century CE, in the Theologiae Graecae Compendium (Ch. 33) offers a view of the significance of both snake and staff: In any case, the two symbols certainly merged in antiquity as representations of the snake coiled about the staff are common. It has been claimed that the snake wrapped around the staff was a species of rat snake, Elaphe longissima, the Aesculapian snake.Gerald David Hart, Martin St. J. Forrest, Asclepius: The God of Medicine, 2000, p42 =Theories= Using a matchstick to wind up and remove a Dracunculus medinensis worm from the leg of a human Some commentators have interpreted the symbol as a direct representation of traditional treatment of dracunculiasis, the Guinea worm disease.Dickson Despommier, People, Parasites, and Plowshares: Learning from Our Body's Most Terrifying Invaders, Columbia University Press, 2016 (first edition in 2013), pp. 147‚Äì163 (chapter 7 on Dracunculus medinensis), . The worm emerges from painful ulcerous blisters. The blisters burn, causing the patient to immerse the affected area in water to cool and soothe it. The worm senses the temperature change and discharges its larvae into the water. The traditional treatment was to slowly pull the worm out of the wound over a period of hours to weeks and wind it around a stick. The modern treatment may replace the stick with a piece of sterile gauze, but is otherwise largely identical. Biblical scholars look to the Book of Numbers, in which the Nehushtan (Hebrew: ◊†◊ó◊ï◊©◊™◊ü or ◊†◊ó◊© ◊î◊†◊ó◊ï◊©◊™) was a brass serpent on a pole that God told Moses to erect, saying that anyone bitten [by a snake] would live if they looked at it.\\"And the Lord said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live. And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived. This Biblical account is the earliest known record of the pole/serpent combination (though the exact configuration is not known).

David Crane coded the overlaid sprites. It was well received and successful commercially, selling over one million cartridges by 1983. Kaboom! is an unauthorized adaptation of the 1978 Atari, Inc. coin-op Avalanche. The gameplay of both games is fundamentally the same, but Kaboom! was re-themed to be about a mad bomber instead of falling rocks. As an ex- Atari programmer, Larry Kaplan, originally wanted to port Avalanche to the Atari 2600. In Avalanche all the boulders are lined up at the top which is difficult to accomplish on the 2600, hence the shift to the Mad Bomber. Atari 8-bit family and Atari 5200 ports followed in 1983.  Gameplay  Kaboom! on the Atari 2600 The game is similar to Avalanche in concept, but instead of there being a pre-existing set of rocks across the top of the screen that randomly fall, a character known as the \\"Mad Bomber\\" moves back and forth randomly dropping bombs. As the game progresses, the Mad Bomber traverses the top of the screen much more erratically, dropping bombs at increasingly higher speeds, making each of the seven higher levels more difficult. The player uses a paddle controller to move buckets back and forth near the bottom of the screen to catch the bombs before they reach the bottom. The player starts with multiple buckets arranged over each other, which makes it more likely to catch the bombs in one of them. If the player fails to catch a bomb, it explodes, along with any other bombs still on the screen in a chain reaction from bottom to top. This also causes one of the buckets to disappear, the game ending when the player loses the last one. Points are awarded for every bomb caught, and extra buckets (maximum of three) are awarded at every 1,000 points. While the Mad Bomber is dropping bombs, he has an unhappy face. If the player misses and a bomb is dropped, he smiles while the bombs on the screen explode. The game manual mentions that something \\"special\\" will happen after 10,000 points.\\"Video passing 10k points, 2 minutes, 28 seconds into perfect machine play of Kaboom!\\" When the player reaches that score threshold, the Mad Bomber's face appears open mouth (surprised) even if the player drops a bomb. When Kaboom! was originally sold, anyone who scored above 3,000 points could send Activision a picture of his or her television screen to receive membership in the Activision Bucket Brigade and a Bucket Brigade patch. Reception Contemporary critical reception was positive with Kaboom! winning an award for \\"Best Audio-Visual Effects\\" at the 3rd annual Arkie Awards. Arkie Award judges characterized the game as \\"a feast for the eyes and ears\\" and commented that Activision had \\"hit the mark dead-center again with 'Kaboom!'\\". While the game concept was described as rather similar to that of Avalanche, Kaboom! was found to have such presentational elan that it was hailed as an \\"instant classic\\". Richard A. Edwards reviewed Kaboom! in The Space Gamer No. 55 Edwards commented that \\"All in all, it is hard to recommend Kaboom! Definitely try this one before buying.\\" Video magazine praised Kaboom! for \\"exceptional\\" graphics and \\"lightning-quick\\" gameplay. Antic in 1984 said that the Atari 8-bit version had \\"cute\\" graphics and was \\"simple, but not by any means easy\\". Ports Kaboom! was later released for the Atari 5200 and the Atari 8-bit family of computers. A 16-bit remake for the Super NES was in the works at some point, but was never released. In the late 1990s, a keychain version of the game was created by Tiger Electronics. Kaboom! is one of the titles included on the Activision Anthology compilation.

Taxonomy  For an example of changing historical perspectives, in 1991, largely genetic evidence indicated that some prominent Eucalyptus species were actually more closely related to Angophora than to other eucalypts; they were accordingly split off into the new genus Corymbia. Although separate, all of these genera and their species are allied and it remains the standard to refer to the members of all seven genera Angophora, Corymbia, Eucalyptus, Stockwellia, Allosyncarpia, Eucalyptopsis and Arillastrum as \\"eucalypts\\" or as the eucalypt group. The extant genera Stockwellia, Allosyncarpia, Eucalyptopsis and Arillastrum comprise six known species, restricted to monsoon forests and rainforests in north-eastern Australia, the Arnhem Land plateau, New Guinea, the Moluccas and New Caledonia. These genera are recognised as having evolved from ancient lineages of the family Myrtaceae. According to genetic, fossil and morphological evidence, it is hypothesised that they evolved into separate taxa before the evolution of the more widespread and well-known genera Eucalyptus, Corymbia and Angophora, and all of their many species. Eucalyptus deglupta has naturally spread the furthest from the Australian geographic origin of the genus Eucalyptus, being the only species known growing naturally in the nearby northern hemisphere, from New Guinea to New Britain, Sulawesi, Seram Island to Mindanao, Philippines. Eucalyptus urophylla also grows naturally as far west as the Flores and Timor islands.  Adaptations  Epicormic regrowth from eucalypt bark, four months after Black Saturday bushfires, Strathewen, Victoria Eucalypts from fire-prone habitats are attuned to withstand fire in several ways: * Their seeds are often held in an insulated capsule, which opens only in response to and after the devastation of a bushfire. Once cooled down, the land becomes a freshly fertilised seed bed. * Oils in the leaves tend to make the fire more severe and therefore more damaging to less attuned species, giving an evolutionary advantage to the eucalypts. Epicormic buds under the often thick bark of the trunk and branches are ready to sprout new stems and leaves after a fire. Australian biologist Jeremy Griffith has documented the dangers posed by eucalypts because of their propensity for fire. These advantages work well in areas affected by long dry spells. Over 700 eucalypt species dominate landscapes all over Australia, but diversity is reduced in rainforests and arid environments.

Painting by Gerrit Adriaenszoon Berckheyde (Gem√§ldegalerie, Dresden). The Hague has been the seat of government of the Netherlands since 1588. The Binnenhof houses the States General of the Netherlands. Amsterdam is the capital of the Netherlands according to the Constitution of the Netherlands, although the States General and the Executive Branch have been situated in The Hague since 1588, along with the Supreme Court and the Council of State. Since the 1983 revision of the Constitution of the Netherlands, Article 32 mentions that \\"the King shall be sworn in and inaugurated as soon as possible in the capital city, Amsterdam\\". It is the only reference in the document stating that Amsterdam is the capital. In contrast, The Hague is customarily called the residentie (‚Äòresidence‚Äô). Only once during its history was Amsterdam both \\"capital\\" and seat of government. Between 1808 and 1810, during the Kingdom of Holland, King Louis Napoleon resided in Amsterdam and declared the city capital of his kingdom and seat of government. To accommodate the king, the grand seventeenth-century Town Hall of Amsterdam, prime example of the republican values that were prevalent for so long in the Netherlands, was converted into a Royal Palace. In 1810, the Netherlands was annexed by the French Empire and King Louis Napoleon was replaced by a French governor, who took up residence in the Royal Palace in Amsterdam. From 1810 to 1813 Amsterdam kept its position of capital city somewhat, as Emperor Napoleon declared the city to be the third city of the Empire (after Paris and Rome) and an imperial residence. In December 1813, after the fall of Napoleon and the accession of Prince William VI of Orange as Sovereign of the Netherlands, The Hague was restored as the seat of government. Historical background Although the proper legal status of Amsterdam as capital of the Netherlands is of recent date, the city has been uniformly recognised as capital ever since 1814. This is partly because it is a Royal City, used not only for the inauguration of kings, but also for royal weddings (note though that royal burials take place in Delft), and also because of its dominant position in Dutch history. From the end of the 16th century the city grew rapidly to become the largest and most powerful city in the Netherlands and the main centre of trade, commerce, finance and culture. The origins of the split between Amsterdam as capital city and The Hague as seat of government lay in the peculiar Dutch constitutional history. From the middle-ages to the sixteenth century, The Hague had been the seat of government of the County of Holland and residence of the Counts of Holland. Amsterdam in the meantime, was growing to be a more important city. After the establishment of the Republic of the United Netherlands in 1572/1581, Dordrecht briefly became the seat of government of the United Provinces, residence of the States General, the Council of State and the Prince of Orange as Prince Stadtholder. In 1588 these central governmental institutions were moved to The Hague, which, from that point onwards, kept the position of seat of government for the whole republic. Amsterdam remained loyal to the Spanish/Burgundian empire until relatively late in the Eighty Years War, which allowed the city a lot of trade opportunities, but made it unsuitable for the seat of government of the emerging 'rebel' state. Before the institution of the Batavian Republic of 1795, the Netherlands were not a unitary state, but more of a confederation in which the independent provinces and the larger cities and towns were very much politically autonomous. During the seventeenth century, the Prince Stadtholder as official of the States of Holland clashed several times with the city government of Amsterdam about policy, up to the point that the city was beleaguered by the army. Up to 1795 there remained a strong animosity between the Orange faction and the republican faction in Dutch politics. The former supported the idea of hereditary political leadership vested in the princes of Orange as Stadtholders, and had its powerbase in The Hague and the rural areas. The latter supported civic independence and found its support mainly in the cities and towns of Holland, with Amsterdam as its progenitor and most outspoken representative. When in 1814 the new kingdom was formed, the appointment of Amsterdam, still the most prominent city in the kingdom, as capital city was also very much a conciliatory gesture of the Orange faction towards the town, and a recognition of the strong civic and republican basis of the new kingdom.

Often referred to as the \\"Dean of Industrial Design\\", Teague pioneered in the establishment of industrial design as a profession in the US, along with Norman Bel Geddes, Raymond Loewy, and Henry Dreyfuss. Regarded as a classicist and a traditionalist despite a later shift to modern tastes, Teague is recognized as a critical figure in the spread of mid-century modernism in America. He is widely known for his exhibition designs during the 1939-40 New York World's Fair, such as the Ford Building, and his iconic product and package designs, from Eastman Kodak's Bantam Special to the steel-legged Steinway piano. A self-described late starter whose professional acclaim began as he approached age 50, Teague sought to create heirlooms out of mass- produced manufactured objects, and frequently cited beauty as \\"visible rightness\\". In 1926, Teague assembled an industrial design consultancy (now known as Teague), which carries on his legacy today, in name and vision. Biography Teague was one of six children born to an established Decatur, Indiana family. In 1840, Teague's grandfather had moved from North Carolina to Pendleton, Indiana, home to one of America's largest Quaker communities.Seldes, Gilbert, \\"Profiles: Industrial Classicist - Profile of Walter Dorwin Teague,\\" New Yorker, December 15, 1934. Teague's father, of Irish forebears, became a circuit-riding Methodist minister (and later full- time tailor) who settled in Pendleton with his family. With little money, the Teague household was laden with books.\\"A Realist in Industrial Design,\\" Art and Decoration, pp. 44-48, October 1934.Flinchum, Russell, \\"Why Teague Matters,\\" Design Criticism Department, School of Visual Arts, New York, NY, October 22, 2010. At age 16, while he was still in school in Pendleton, Teague worked as a handyman at the local paper, where he quickly became a jack-of- all-trades and eventually a reporter. =Career beginnings= Books on architecture in his high school library influenced Teague's desire to become an artist.\\"Walter Dorwin Teague: Industrial Designer Remembered,\\" Business News - San Diego, p. 6, December 19, 1983. At 19 years old, Teague left Indiana for New York City.The Grove Encyclopedia of Decorative Arts, Gordon Campbell 2006 ed., Oxford University Press; Vol. 2, p. 437. He studied painting from 1903 to 1907 at the Art Students League of New York, where he met his first wife, Celia Fehon, a fellow artist. To earn money upon his arrival in New York, Teague checked hats at the Young Men's Christian Association in Manhattan, where he also began sign painting. His lettering work evolved into illustration projects for mail order catalogues, for which he drew apparel items such as neckties and shoes. Refusing involvement in the fashion industry, Teague focused his creative efforts on elaborate advertising illustrations, which caught the attention of Walter Whitehead, an advertising executive whom Teague had met at the YMCA. Whitehead hired Teague at the Ben Hampton Advertising Agency. When Whitehead left Ben Hampton for the larger agency of Calkins & Holden in 1908, Teague went with him. During Teague's four years at Calkins & Holden, he developed a distinct artistic style recognized by Earnest Elmo Calkins as a reconciliation of past art and present day production. By 1911, Teague was an active freelancer in decorative design and typography. He also shared offices with Bruce Rogers and Frederic Goudy, and was a co-founder of Pynson Printers. Teague became known for his distinctive frames for advertising art, which blended Baroque and Renaissance influence with a simplicity ideal for high-volume printing presses. In 1912, Teague left Calkins & Holden to expand his freelance work from his own typographic studio. Through his graphic design contributions to magazines, Teague's signature style earned widespread recognition in his field, particularly during the early 1920s when he designed frames for the famous Arrow Collar ads. \\"Teague borders\\" became a generic term for ad frames of a certain type, even those created by others.Abercrombie, Stanley, \\"Fifty Years of Interior Design,\\" Interiors, New York, June 1977 By the mid-1920s, as the demand for border designs weakened, Teague had become lightly involved in commercial packaging. Intrigued by the International Paris Exposition and European stylistic movements, Teague left for Europe on June 30, 1926 to investigate European design. While abroad he familiarized himself with Bauhaus work during an exhibition in Italy, and became greatly inspired by the architectural creations and writings of Le Corbusier. =Pioneering an occupation= As the Great Depression loomed in America and mass-produced, machine-made objects intensified, large companies were desperate to find measures of survival. Stirred by European modernism, America's design heritage, and a keen understanding of modern market dynamics, Teague promoted new ideas about the impact and significance of design in American culture, fueled, so, too, by the desire to transform machine-made objects into contextual heirlooms.Woodham, Jonathan M., \\"Twentieth-Century Design,\\" from Oxford History of Art. Oxford University Press (USA), 1997. Teague, Walter Dorwin, \\"Design as a Construction Stimulant in Marketing,\\" Reprinted from the Seventh International Management Congress, Washington DC, 1938. Shortly before Teague concluded his 18-year advertising career, he partook in several commissions in product design, for which a growing number of clients sought counseling.Teague, Walter Dorwin, \\"A Quarter Century of Industrial Design in the United States,\\" Art & Industry, London, 1951. At age 43, Teague established a sole proprietorship devoted to product and package design. By 1927, Teague added \\"Industrial Design\\" to his letterhead upon landing his first big client, Eastman Kodak. Richard Bach, a curator of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, had recommended Teague to Adolph Stuber, a top manager of Rochester, New York-based Eastman Kodak, when the company was considering the assistance of an artist to design cameras. With no knowledge of cameras, Teague proposed working on-site in collaboration with Kodak engineers. Designing according to engineering necessities, insisted Teague, \\"ultimately leads to greater beauty and heavier sales.\\" In Teague's Forbes article, \\"Modern Design Needs Modern Merchandising,\\" published February 1, 1928, he advises, \\"The designer who gets results for the manufacturer plans with all departments of a business before he ever lays pencil to drawing board.\\"\\"Modern Design Needs Modern Merchandising,\\" By Walter Dorwin Teague as told to Charles G. Mueller, Forbes, February 1, 1932. Camera, No. 1A Gift Kodak, ca.1930 Brooklyn Museum On January 1, 1928, Teague embarked on a design endeavor that culminated in an extensive relationship with Kodak‚Äîthat would last until his death. He designed a number of well-known Kodak cameras, including an Art Deco gift camera (1928), the Baby Brownie (1934), the Bantam Special (1936) (considered a masterpiece of Art Deco styling and one of the most popular cameras ever produced,\\"Teague80: 8 Decades of Influential Design.\\" Published and printed by Walter Dorwin Teague Associates, copyright 2006, Seattle.) and the Brownie Hawkeye (1950). By redesigning the camera case to match the camera, the two items presented a unity difficult to break during purchase; thus, the sales of carrying cases increased four times over in 1934. Teague's camera designs for Kodak expanded into the design of Kodak's displays, retail spaces, and exhibits. By 1934, the company created an entire styling division, to which Teague's role became advisory. =Design expansion & corporate identity= Sparton Table Radio, ca. 1936 Brooklyn Museum Within two years of his first endeavor with Eastman Kodak, Teague's scope of industrial design work and number of clients multiplied. While design culture sustained a rather elitist attainability through the 1930s, Teague pursued strategic relationships with large businesses selling products to the masses. In addition to gaining widespread attention for such designs as the Marmon V-16, the first automobile to be conceived by an industrial designer, designed by Teague and his son, Walter Dorwin Teague, Jr., and the Steinway Peace Piano, Teague's work also included 32 design patterns for Steuben Glass, a division of Corning Glass Works, the Sparton \\"Bluebird\\" Radio, and the design of passenger cars and diners for the New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad. The concept of \\"Corporate Identity\\" emerged from the cross- disciplined work of commercial design and the human-designed environment, first shown through Teague's retail-space design for Eastman Kodak. Elevating this concept into a first-of-its-kind corporate identity program for Texaco Company, Teague created an expansive brand image that included the design of full station layouts for Texaco service stations, pumps, signs, cans, and trucks.DiTullo, Michael, ‚ÄúLast Man Standing: 80 years of Teague Design,‚Äù Core77, August 2006. More than 20,000 of these art-deco style stations had been built worldwide by 1960. =World's Fairs and expositions= In the 1930s and 1940s, corporate identity was prolifically popularized in America through elaborate fairs and expositions, which showcased industry sponsors' contributions to modern living. Teague‚Äîwho, prior, had no formal training in architecture or engineering‚Äîsucceeded in becoming licensed as an architect in New York State. Designed for the 1939 New York World's Fair, the National Cash Register Building functioned not only as an exhibit center, but as the world's largest active cash register. The design showcases NCR's new 100 Model through the seven-story register atop the building. Teague commenced his deep involvement in exhibition design with his work on the Ford Building at Chicago's The Century of Progress 1933-34 fair,Keyes, Jacqueline Abbot, \\"The Fair - Demonstration of Modern Methods of Living,\\" Art& Industry, December 1936. for which he prepared for three months, commuting between Detroit and New York. His architectural contributions also included the Texaco exhibition hall at the 1935 Texas Centennial Exposition in Dallas, Texas, and the Ford pavilion for the 1935 California Pacific International Exposition in Balboa Park in San Diego.Marchand, Roland, \\"The Designers Go to the Fair: Walter Dorwin Teague and the Professionalization of Corporate Industrial Exhibits, 1933-1940, Design Issues, Vol. 8, No. 1 (Autumn, 1991), pp. 4-17, The MIT Press. Teague made a substantial impact on the 1939-40 New York World's Fair as one of seven members of the Fair's design board, and was also responsible for nine corporate displays. In addition to his design of the Ford and US Steel pavilions, Teague introduced the new National Cash Register 100 Model, exemplifying \\"art moderne\\", with a seven-story high cash register placed atop the NCR exhibition, also shown at the 1939 Golden Gate International Exhibition in San Francisco.\\"Streamlined Design of NCR 100 Cash Register is cited on 'Smithsonian World' TV Program,\\" Centennial Year Spotlight, NCR News, March 1984. Teague's additional exhibition work includes that for the 1957 Milan Triennial, 1961 Civil War Centennial Dome in Richmond, Virginia, the US Science Center for the World's Fair in Seattle, as well as the \\"House of the Future\\" for the Festival of Gas at the 1964 World's Fair.Votolato, Gregory. American Design in the Twentieth Century. Manchester and New York: Manchester University Press, 1998. . =Post-WWII: confirming a profession= Teague, along with fellow industrial designer pioneers Raymond Loewy and Henry Dreyfuss, experienced monumental success following World War II. The post-war economic boom fueled the American consumer's desire for more and better products, intensifying the demand for industrial design among American businesses. In 1944, Teague successfully defended the assertion that industrial design was a profession, citing its contributions to the public good before the appeals court in New York State, setting a national precedent. =Walter Dorwin Teague Associates= As early as his first Kodak designs, Teague had accumulated a team of expert associates. By 1938, Teague's office grew to 55 employees, including architects, engineers, 3D artists and industrial designers. Teague had also signed his first design retainer contract with Polaroid, culminating in the development of the Land Camera, the first camera able to develop its own prints, introduced in 1948. In 1945, when Teague's growing studio of designers, architects and technicians was supplemented with an engineering division, Teague changed his company structure from a sole proprietorship to a partnership, allowing senior staff to be partners in Walter Dorwin Teague Associates.Biographical Notes of Walter Dorwin Teague; Walter Dorwin Teague Associates, New York, 1951; Print, Teague Archives, accessed 2010 and 2011. In 1946, Frank Del Giudice (who would later become the company's presidentBartel, Bill, and Tom Webb, \\"White House in the Sky,\\" The Seattle Times, September 25, 1988.) represented WDTA in seeking commissions from The Boeing Company, not only commencing WDTA's lasting relationship with Boeing, but the Company's substantial impact in aerospace.\\"Design Firm's Boeing Link in 20th Year,\\" Seattle Daily Times, May 28, 1965. By 1959, WDTA's client list included Ac'cent, Polaroid, Schaefer Beer, Procter & Gamble, UPS, Steinway, General Foods Corporation, Boeing, Con Edison, Du Pont, US Steel, NASA, and the US Navy. A 1959 Fortune survey reported that WDTA was then second in gross revenue among those industrial design firms also doing architecture and interior design (Raymond Loewy Associates was first). Accredited with iconic designs such as the UPS truck, Pringles Potato Chips canister, Scope Mouthwash bottle, Regan-era Air Force One, Polaroid Land Camera, and more. Walter Dorwin Teague Associates is now known as Teague. The privately held Seattle-based company is most commonly recognized today for its work in consumer electronics, aviation, digital, virtual reality, and autonomous vehicle interaction design. Its clients include Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, Samsung, Panasonic, and Boeing, and projects such as the Xbox and the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. =Society of Industrial Designers (SID)= Teague, Loewy and Dreyfuss, as well as 15 prominent East Coast designers, established the Society of Industrial Designers (SID) as \\"tangible evidence of the arriving maturity of the field,\\" according to Teague, who also said, \\"Its purpose is to define and maintain standards of ethics and performance within the profession, and to guide and improve the still somewhat experimental education of future designers. For his accomplishments in establishing industrial design as a profession, Teague was named the first president of SID in February 1944. In 1955, the SID changed its name to the American Society of Industrial Design (ASID), and by 1965 the organization had evolved into today's Industrial Designers Society of America (IDSA). =Death= Teague died in Flemington, New Jersey on December 5, 1960, less than a year after addressing the Royal Society of the Arts, and less than two weeks shy of his 77th birthday. Twice married, Teague was survived by his second wife, his two sons and his daughter (from his first marriage).W Dorwin Teague (obituary) His son, Walter Dorwin Teague Jr., who began working with his father in 1934, also devoted his career to industrial design until his own death in 2004. =Posthumous recognition= In 1963, the ASID honored Teague by offering the organization's first scholarship program, The Walter Dorwin Teague Scholarship, eligible to select junior students majoring in industrial design. The first scholarship of $1000 was presented in May 1964.\\"ASID Scholarship Honors Walter Dorwin Teague,\\" Printing News from WDTA archives, July 3, 1963; accessed March 14, 2012. In 2007, Teague posthumously won the Personal Recognition Award from IDSA. In January 2011, Teague was one of twelve honored by the United States Postal Service as \\"the nation's most important and influential industrial designers,\\" with a special edition of postal stamps. The Smithsonian's Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum was the setting for the dedication. In August 2014, Teague was named to the Academy of Fellows by the IDSA.Academy of Fellows recommendation Such recommendations are for members in good standing who have earned the special respect and affection of the membership through distinguished service to the society and to the profession as a whole.\\" =Biographical Documentary Film= In 2014 the feature documentary film \\"Teague: Design & Beauty\\" by independent filmmaker, Jason A. Morris, premiered in Austin, Texas. The film documented Teague's life, his rise to prominence, his turbulent relationship with a rebellious son, and the stories behind some of his greatest designs. The film was an official selection at the 2015 Newport Beach Film Festival, Trail Dance Film Festival, and San Diego Design Film Festival. It was also screened at design schools and museums across the United States. Quotes on industrial design The following passages are quoted from Teague's article, \\"A Quarter Century of Industrial Design in the United States,\\" published in Art & Industry, London, 1951: *\\"In competitive markets success is measured not by quick, erratic profits, no matter how large, but by steady, dependable public support over a long period. Permanent success is achieved only by winning and holding public confidence.\\" *\\"We have not the slightest doubt that we are adding something of positive value to the American way of life. We are even augmenting the sum of total beauty in our world, and extending the appreciation of beauty into those realms where it is most vitally effective‚Äîthe home, the factory, the shop and the street.\\" Publications Teague's best-known book, Design This Day- The Technique of Order in the Machine Age, was first published in 1940,Teague, Walter Dorwin. Design This Day: The Technique of Order in the Machine Age.(original title) New York: Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1940; reprinted Design This Day (abridged) by Teague, 2006. as the first book on the whole subject of industrial design, tracing the development of modern design and outlining necessary techniques to the solution of design problems. Described as a \\"milestone\\" in the industry, the book explores the evolution of civilization's reliance on increased industrialization and explains the designer's role. Teague (the Company) reprinted the book in 2006. Teague also wrote Land of Plenty, A Summary of Possibilities (1947), and, with John Storck, Flour for Man's Bread, a History of Milling (1952).

It is the second-oldest freshwater lake in the world, the second-largest by volume, and the second-deepest, in all cases after Lake Baikal in Siberia. It is the world's longest freshwater lake. The lake is shared between four countries ‚Äì Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Burundi, and Zambia, with Tanzania (46%) and DRC (40%) possessing the majority of the lake. It drains into the Congo River system and ultimately into the Atlantic Ocean. Etymology The name \\"Tanganyika\\" apparently refers to \\"the great lake spreading out like a plain\\", or \\"plain-like lake\\".Stanley, H.M., 1899, Through the Dark Continent, London: G. Newnes, Vol. One , Vol. Two Geography and geological history Lake Tanganyika is situated within the Albertine Rift, the western branch of the East African Rift, and is confined by the mountainous walls of the valley. It is the largest rift lake in Africa and the second-largest lake by volume in the world. It is the deepest lake in Africa and holds the greatest volume of fresh water, accounting for 16% of the world's available fresh water. It extends for in a general north-south direction and averages in width. The lake covers , with a shoreline of , a mean depth of and a maximum depth of (in the northern basin). It holds an estimated . The catchment area of the lake is . Two main rivers flow into the lake, as well as numerous smaller rivers and streams (whose lengths are limited by the steep mountains around the lake). The one major outflow is the Lukuga River, which empties into the Congo River drainage. Precipation and evaporation play a greater role than the rivers. At least 90% of the water influx is from rain falling on the lake's surface and at least 90% of the water loss is from direct evaporation. The major river flowing into the lake is the Ruzizi River, formed about 10,000 years ago, which enters the north of the lake from Lake Kivu. The Malagarasi River, which is Tanzania's second largest river, enters the east side of Lake Tanganyika. The Malagarasi is older than Lake Tanganyika, and before the lake was formed, it probably was a headwater of the Lualaba River, the main Congo River headstream. The lake has a complex history of changing flow patterns, due to its high altitude, great depth, slow rate of refill, and mountainous location in a turbulently volcanic area that has undergone climate changes. Apparently, it has rarely in the past had an outflow to the sea. It has been described as \\"practically endorheic\\" for this reason. The lake's connection to the sea is dependent on a high water level allowing water to overflow out of the lake through the Lukuga River into the Congo. When not overflowing, the lake's exit into the Lukuga River typically is blocked by sand bars and masses of weed, and instead this river depends on its own tributaries, especially the Niemba River, to maintain a flow. Due to the lake's tropical location, it has a high rate of evaporation. Thus, it depends on a high inflow through the Ruzizi out of Lake Kivu to keep the lake high enough to overflow. This outflow is apparently not more than 12,000 years old, and resulted from lava flows blocking and diverting the Kivu basin's previous outflow into Lake Edward and then the Nile system, and diverting it to Lake Tanganyika. Signs of ancient shorelines indicate that at times, Tanganyika may have been up to lower than its present surface level, with no outlet to the sea. Even its current outlet is intermittent, thus may not have been operating when first visited by Western explorers in 1858. The lake may also have at times had different inflows and outflows; inward flows from a higher Lake Rukwa, access to Lake Malawi and an exit route to the Nile have all been proposed to have existed at some point in the lake's history. Lake Tanganyika is an ancient lake. Its three basins, which in periods with much lower water levels were separate lakes, are of different ages. The central began to form 9‚Äì12 million years ago (Mya), the northern 7‚Äì8 Mya and the southern 2‚Äì4 Mya. = Islands = Of the several islands in Lake Tanganyika, the most important are: * Kavala Island (DRC) * Mamba-Kayenda Islands (DRC) * Milima Island (DRC) * Kibishie Island (DRC) * Mutondwe Island (Zambia) * Kumbula Island (Zambia) Water characteristics The lake's water is alkaline with a pH around 9 at depths of . Below this, it is around 8.7, gradually decreasing to 8.3‚Äì8.5 in the deepest parts of Tanganyika. A similar pattern can be seen in the electric conductivity, ranging from about 670 ŒºS/cm in the upper part to 690 ŒºS/cm in the deepest. Surface temperatures generally range from about in the southern part of the lake in early August to in the late rainy season in March‚ÄîApril. At depths greater than , the temperature is very stable at . The water has gradually warmed since the 1800s and this has accelerated with global warming since the 1950s. The lake is stratified and seasonal mixing generally does not extend beyond depths of . The mixing mainly occurs as upwellings in the south and is wind-driven, but to a lesser extent, up- and downwellings also occur elsewhere in the lake. As a consequence of the stratification, the deep sections contain \\"fossil water\\".Hutter; Yongqi; and Chubarenko (2011). Physics of Lakes, volume 1: Foundation of the Mathematical and Physical Background. P. 11. . This also means it has no oxygen (it is anoxic) in the deeper parts, essentially limiting fish and other aerobic organisms to the upper part. Some geographical variations are seen in this limit, but it is typically at depths around in the northern part of the lake and in the south.Wright, J.J.; and L.M. Page (2006).

Almost all (98%) of the Tanganyika cichlids are endemic to the lake and it is thus an important biological resource for the study of speciation in evolution. Some of the endemics do occur slightly into the upper Lukuga River, Lake Tanganyika's outflow, but further spread into the Congo River basin is prevented by physics (Lukuga has fast-flowing sections with many rapids and waterfalls) and chemistry (Tanganyika's water is alkaline, while the Congo's generally is acidic). The cichlids of the African Great Lakes, including Tanganyika, represent the most diverse extent of adaptive radiation in vertebrates. Although Tanganyika has far fewer cichlid species than Lakes Malawi and Victoria which both have experienced relatively recent explosive species radiations (resulting in many closely related species), its cichlids are the most morphologically and genetically diverse. This is linked to the high age of Tanganyika, as it is far older than the other lakes. Tanganyika has the largest number of endemic cichlid genera of all African lakes. All Tanganyika cichlids are in the subfamily Pseudocrenilabrinae. Of the 10 tribes in this subfamily, half are largely or entirely restricted to the lake (Cyprichromini, Ectodini, Lamprologini, Limnochromini and Tropheini) and another three have species in the lake (Haplochromini, Tilapiini and Tylochromini). Others have proposed splitting the Tanganyika cichlids into as many as 12‚Äì16 tribes (in addition to previous mentioned, Bathybatini, Benthochromini, Boulengerochromini, Cyphotilapiini, Eretmodini, Greenwoodochromini, Perissodini and Trematocarini). Most Tanganyika cichlids live along the shoreline down to a depth of , but some deep-water species regularly descend to . Trematocara species have exceptionally been found at more than , which is deeper than any other cichlid in the world.Loiselle, Paul (1994). The Cichlid Aquarium, p. 304. Tetra Press, Germany. . Some of the deep-water cichlids (e.g., Bathybates, Gnathochromis, Hemibates and Xenochromis) have been caught in places virtually devoid of oxygen, but how they are able to survive there is unclear. Tanganyika cichlids are generally benthic (found at or near the bottom) and/or coastal.Lindqvist, O.V.; H. M√∂ls√§; K. Solonen; J. Sarvala, editors (1999). From Limnology to Fisheries: Lake Tanganyika and Other Large Lakes. pp. 213‚Äì214. Springer. No Tanganyika cichlids are truly pelagic and offshore, except for some of the piscivorous Bathybates. Two of these, B. fasciatus and B. leo, mainly feed on Tanganyika sardines. Tanganyika cichlids differ extensively in ecology and include species that are herbivores, detritivores, planktivores, insectivores, molluscivores, scavengers, scale-eaters and piscivores. Their breeding behavior fall into two main groups, the substrate spawners (often in caves or rock crevices) and the mouthbrooders.Schliewen, U. (1992). Aquarium Fish. Barron's Educational Series. . Among the endemic species are two of the world's smallest cichlids, Neolamprologus multifasciatus and N. similis (both shell dwellers) at up to , and one of the largest, the giant cichlid (Boulengerochromis microlepis) at up to . Many cichlids from Lake Tanganyika, such as species from the genera Altolamprologus, Cyprichromis, Eretmodus, Julidochromis, Lamprologus, Neolamprologus, Tropheus and Xenotilapia, are popular aquarium fish due to their bright colors and patterns, and interesting behaviors. Recreating a Lake Tanganyika biotope to host those cichlids in a habitat similar to their natural environment is also popular in the aquarium hobby.

The open waters of the pelagic zone are dominated by four non-cichlid species: Two species of \\"Tanganyika sardine\\" (Limnothrissa miodon and Stolothrissa tanganicae) form the largest biomass of fish in this zone, and they are important prey for the forktail lates (Lates microlepis) and sleek lates (L. stappersii). Two additional lates are found in the lake, the Tanganyika lates (L. angustifrons) and bigeye lates (L. mariae), but both these are primarily benthic hunters, although they also may move into open waters. The four lates, all endemic to Tanganyika, have been overfished and larger individuals are rare today. Among the more unusual fish in the lake are the endemic, facultatively brood parasitic \\"cuckoo catfish\\", including at least Synodontis grandiopsPlanetCatfish: Synodontis grandiops.

The cichlid pick up the eggs in their mouth as if they were their own. Once the catfish eggs hatch the young eat the cichlid eggs. Six catfish genera are entirely restricted to the lake basin: Bathybagrus, Dinotopterus, Lophiobagrus, Phyllonemus, Pseudotanganikallabes and Tanganikallabes.FishBase: Species in Tanganyika. Retrieved 3 April 2017. Although not endemic on a genus level, six species of Chrysichthys catfish are only found in the Tanganyika basin where they live both in shallow and relatively deep waters; in the latter habitat they are the primary predators and scavengers. A unique evolutionary radiation in the lake is the 15 species of Mastacembelus spiny eels, all but one endemic to its basin. Although other African Great Lakes have Synodontis catfish, endemic catfish genera and Mastacembelus spiny eels, the relatively high diversity is unique to Tanganyika, which likely is related to its old age. Among the non-endemic fish, some are widespread African species but several are only shared with the Malagarasi and Congo River basins, such as the Congo bichir (Polypterus congicus), goliath tigerfish (Hydrocynus goliath), Citharinus citharus, six- banded distichodus (Distichodus sexfasciatus) and mbu puffer (Tetraodon mbu). =Molluscs and crustaceans= The shell of the endemic thalassoid freshwater snail Tiphobia horei with its elaborate shape and spines. A total of 83 freshwater snail species (65 endemic) and 11 bivalve species (8 endemic) are known from the lake. Among the endemic bivalves are three monotypic genera: Grandidieria burtoni, Pseudospatha tanganyicensis and Brazzaea anceyi. Many of the snails are unusual for species living in freshwater in having noticeably thickened shells and/or distinct sculpture, features more commonly seen in marine snails. They are referred to as thalassoids, which can be translated to \\"marine-like\\".Brown, D. (1994). Freshwater Snails Of Africa And Their Medical Importance. 2nd edition. All the Tanganyika thalassoids, which are part of Prosobranchia, are endemic to the lake. Initially they were believed to be related to similar marine snails, but they are now known to be unrelated. Their appearance is now believed to be the result of the highly diverse habitats in Lake Tanganyika and evolutionary pressure from snail-eating fish and, in particular, Platythelphusa crabs. A total of 17 freshwater snail genera are endemic to the lake, such as Hirthia, Lavigeria, Paramelania, Reymondia, Spekia, Stanleya, Tanganyicia and Tiphobia. There are about 30 species of non-thalassoid snails in the lake, but only five of these are endemic, including Ferrissia tanganyicensis and Neothauma tanganyicense. The latter is the largest Tanganyika snail and its shell is often used by small shell-dwelling cichlids. Crustaceans are also highly diverse in Tanganyika with more than 200 species, of which more than half are endemic. They include 10 species of freshwater crabs (9 Platythelphusa and Potamonautes platynotus; all endemic), at least 11 species of small atyid shrimp (Atyella, Caridella and Limnocaridina), an endemic palaemonid shrimp (Macrobrachium moorei), about 100 ostracods, including many endemics, and several copepods. Among these, Limnocaridina iridinae lives inside the mantle cavity of the unionid mussel Pleiodon spekei, making it one of only two known commensal species of freshwater shrimp (the other is the sponge-living Caridina spongicola from Lake Towuti, Indonesia). Among Rift Valley lakes, Lake Tanganyika far surpasses all others in terms of crustacean and freshwater snail richness (both in total number of species and number of endemics).Segers, H.; and Martens, K; editors (2005).

Fishing  Fishermen on Lake Tanganyika Lake Tanganyika supports a major fishery, which, depending on source, provides 25‚Äì40% or 60% of the animal protein in the diet of the people living in the region. Currently, there are around 100,000 people directly involved in the fisheries operating from almost 800 sites. The lake is also vital to the estimated 10 million people living in the greater basin. Lake Tanganyika fish can be found exported throughout East Africa. Major commercial fishing began in the mid-1950s and has, together with global warming (limiting the habitat of temperature sensitive species), had a heavy impact on the fish populations, causing significant declines. In 2016, it was estimated that the total catch was up to 200,000 tonnes. Former industrial fisheries, which boomed in the 1980s, have subsequently collapsed. Transport Two ferries carry passengers and cargo along the eastern shore of the lake: between Kigoma and Mpulungu and between Kigoma and Bujumbura. * The port town of Kigoma is the railhead for the railway from Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. * The port town of Kalemie (previously named Albertville) is the railhead for the D.R. Congo rail network. * The port town of Mpulungu is a proposed railhead for Zambia. On Dec. 12, 2014, the ferry MV Mutambala capsized on Lake Tanganyika, and more than 120 lives were lost. History Lake Tanganyika. The black line indicates Henry Morton Stanley's route. It is thought that early Homo sapiens were making an impact on the region during the stone age. The time period of the Middle Stone Age to Late Stone Age is described as an age of advanced hunter-gatherers. It is believed they would have caused megafaunal extinctions. There are many methods in which the native people of the area were fishing. Most of them included using a lantern as a lure for fish that are attracted to light. There were three basic forms. One called Lusenga which is a wide net used by one person from a canoe. The second one is using a lift net. This was done by dropping a net deep below the boat using two parallel canoes and then simultaneously pulling it up. The third is called Chiromila which consisted of three canoes. One canoe was stationary with a lantern while another canoe holds one end of the net and the other circles the stationary one to meet up with the net. The first known Westerners to find the lake were the British explorers Richard Burton and John Speke, in 1858. They located it while searching for the source of the Nile River. Speke continued and found the actual source, Lake Victoria. Later David Livingstone passed by the lake. He noted the name \\"Liemba\\" for its southern part, a word probably from the Fipa language, and in 1927 this was chosen as the new name for the conquered German First World War ship Graf von G√∂tzen which is still serving the lake up to the present time. =World War I= The lake was the scene of two celebrated battles during World War I. With the aid of the Graf Goetzen (named after Count Gustav Adolf Graf von G√∂tzen, the former governor of German East Africa), the Germans had complete control of the lake in the early stages of the war. The ship was used both to ferry cargo and personnel across the lake, and as a base from which to launch surprise attacks on Allied troops.Giles Foden: Mimi and Toutou Go Forth ‚Äî The Bizarre Battle for Lake Tanganyika, Penguin, 2004. It therefore became essential for the Allied forces to gain control of the lake themselves. Under the command of Lieutenant Commander Geoffrey Spicer-Simson the British Royal Navy achieved the monumental task of bringing two armed motor boats HMS Mimi and HMS Toutou from England to the lake by rail, road and river to Albertville (since renamed Kalemie in 1971) on the western shore of Lake Tanganyika. The two boats waited until December 1915, and mounted a surprise attack on the Germans, with the capture of the gunboat Kingani. Another German vessel, the Hedwig, was sunk in February 1916, leaving the G√∂tzen as the only German vessel remaining to control the lake. As a result of their strengthened position on the lake, the Allies started advancing towards Kigoma by land, and the Belgians established an airbase on the western shore at Albertville. It was from there, in June 1916, that they launched a bombing raid on German positions in and around Kigoma. It is unclear whether or not the G√∂tzen was hit (the Belgians claimed to have hit it but the Germans denied this), but German morale suffered and the ship was subsequently stripped of its gun since it was needed elsewhere. The war on the lake had reached a stalemate by this stage, with both sides refusing to mount attacks. However, the war on land was progressing, largely to the advantage of the Allies, who cut off the railway link in July 1916 and threatened to isolate Kigoma completely. This led the German commander, Gustav Zimmer, to abandon the town and head south. In order to avoid his prize ship falling into Allied hands, Zimmer scuttled the vessel on July 26, 1916. The vessel was later raised in 1924 and renamed MV Liemba (see transport). =Che Guevara= In 1965 Argentinian revolutionary Che Guevara used the western shores of Lake Tanganyika as a training camp for guerrilla forces in the Congo. From his camp, Che and his forces attempted to overthrow the government, but ended up pulling out in less than a year, as the National Security Agency (NSA) had been monitoring him the entire time and the NSA aided government forces in ambushing his guerrillas. =Recent history= In 1992 Lake Tanganyika featured in the British TV documentary series Pole to Pole. The BBC documentarian Michael Palin stayed on board the MV Liemba and travelled across the lake. Since 2004 the lake has been the focus of a massive Water and Nature Initiative by the IUCN. The project is scheduled to take five years at a total cost of US$27 million. The initiative is attempting to monitor the resources and state of the lake, set common criteria for acceptable level of sediments, pollution, and water quality in general, and design and establish a lake basin management authority. = Effects of global warming = Because of increasing global temperature there is a direct correlation to lower productivity in Lake Tanganyika. Southern winds create upwells of deep nutrient-rich water on the southern end of the lake. This happens during the cooler months (May to September). These nutrients that are in deep water are vital in maintaining the aquatic food web. The southerly winds are slowing down which limits the ability for the mixing of nutrients. This is correlating with less productivity in the lake. Alleged Fijian connection According to a legend of the indigenous people from some parts of the Fiji islands in the South Pacific Ocean, the Fijians originated from Tanganyika. This myth is thought to have originated in relatively recent decades. However, this hypothesis is not tenable and is contradicted by archaeological, linguistic and genetic evidence.

Instant worldwide reaction and debate were made possible by round-the-clock television news organizations and by the internet. As a result, most of the events listed below were known by a large portion of the world's population as they occurred. All times given are in Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), or UTC‚àí04:00. Major events 7:59 a.m.: American Airlines Flight 11, a Boeing 767 carrying 81 passengers and 11 crew members, departs 14 minutes late from Logan International Airport in Boston, bound for Los Angeles International Airport. Five hijackers are aboard. 8:14: United Airlines Flight 175, a Boeing 767, carrying 56 passengers and 9 crew members, departs 14 minutes late from Logan International Airport in Boston, bound for Los Angeles International Airport. Five hijackers are aboard. 8:14: Flight 11 is hijacked over central Massachusetts, turning first northwest, then south. 8:20: American Airlines Flight 77, a Boeing 757 with 58 passengers and 6 crew members, departs 10 minutes late from Washington Dulles International Airport, for Los Angeles International Airport. Five hijackers are aboard. 8:42: United Airlines Flight 93, a Boeing 757 with 37 passengers and 7 crew members, departs 42 minutes late from Newark International Airport, bound for San Francisco International Airport. Four hijackers are aboard. 8:42‚Äì8:46 (approx.): Flight 175 is hijacked above northwest New Jersey, about 60 miles northwest of New York City, continuing southwest briefly before turning back to the northeast. 8:46:40: Flight 11 crashes into the north face of the North Tower (1 WTC) of the World Trade Center, between floors 93 and 99. The aircraft enters the tower intact. 8:50‚Äì8:54 (approx.): Flight 77 is hijacked above southern Ohio, turning to the southeast. 9:02:57: Flight 175 crashes into the south face of the South Tower (2 WTC) of the World Trade Center, between floors 77 and 85. Parts of the plane, including the starboard engine, leave the building from its east and north sides, falling to the ground six blocks away. 9:28: Flight 93 is hijacked above northern Ohio, turning to the southeast. 9:37:46: Flight 77 crashes into the western side of The Pentagon and starts a violent fire. 9:45: United States airspace is shut down. 9:59:00: The South Tower of the World Trade Center collapses, 56 minutes after the impact of Flight 175. 10:03:11: Flight 93 is crashed by its hijackers as a result of fighting in the cockpit 80 miles (129 km) southeast of Pittsburgh in Somerset County, Pennsylvania. Later reports indicate that passengers had learned about the World Trade Center and Pentagon crashes and were resisting the hijackers. The 9/11 Commission believed that Flight 93's target was either the United States Capitol building or the White House in Washington, D.C. 10:28:22: The North Tower of the World Trade Center collapses, 1 hour and 42 minutes after the impact of Flight 11. The Marriott Hotel, located at the base of the two towers, is also destroyed. 10:50:19: Five stories of part of the Pentagon collapse due to the fire. 5:20:33 p.m.: 7 World Trade Center, a 47-story building, collapses. Detailed timeline of events=6:00 a.m.= 6:00: Mohamed Atta and Abdulaziz al-Omari travel on Colgan Air Flight 5930 from Portland International Jetport in Portland, Maine, to Logan International Airport in Boston, Massachusetts. 6:00: Polls open for primaries for NYC Mayor, as well as other local offices. 6:45: Atta and al- Omari arrive at Logan International Airport. 6:52: Marwan al-Shehhi calls Atta from another terminal at Logan to confirm that the plans for the attack are set. =7:00 a.m.= 7:23‚Äì7:28: Al-Shehhi and his hijacking team boards Flight 175. 7:35: Atta and al-Omari board American Airlines Flight 11. 7:39‚Äì7:48: Ziad Jarrah and his hijacking team boards Flight 93. 7:40: The rest of the Flight 11 hijackers board the airplane. 7:45: Flight 11 is pushed back from Gate B32 at Logan International Airport. 7:46: Ziad Jarrah calls Marwan Al- Shehhi from Newark International Airport (now Newark Liberty International Airport) to also confirm the attacks were ready to begin. 7:50: Hani Hanjour and his four fellow hijackers board American Airlines Flight 77. 7:58: United Airlines Flight 175 is pushed back from Gate C19 at Logan International Airport. 7:59: Flight 11, a Boeing 767 carrying 81 passengers and 11 crew members, departs 14 minutes late from Logan International Airport in Boston, its destination being Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) in Los Angeles, California. =8:00 a.m.= 8:01: United Airlines Flight 93 is pushed back from Gate A17 at Newark International Airport. 8:09: Flight 77 is pushed back from Gate D26 at Dulles International Airport. 8:13:35: Flight 11 has its last routine communication with the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA's) Boston Air Route Traffic Control Center (hereinafter \\"Boston Center\\"). > Boston Sector: American 11, turn twenty degrees right. American Airlines > Flight 11: Turning right, American 11. 8:13:52: Boston Center instructs Flight 11 to climb to 35,000 feet twice, but receives no reply. They contact Athens Sector to inform them that the flight is \\"NORDO\\" (no radio). Boston Center continues to attempt to re-establish contact with the flight without success. 8:14: Flight 11 is hijacked when hijackers Waleed and Wail al-Shehri rise from seats 2A and 2B and stab two flight attendants. Atta rises from seat 8D and approaches the cockpit. Within minutes, he is at the controls. 8:14: Flight 175, another fully fueled Boeing 767, carrying 56 passengers and nine crew members, also departs from Logan International Airport in Boston; its destination was also Los Angeles International Airport. Five hijackers are aboard. One of them, most likely al- Shehhi, communicated with Mohammed Atta shortly before American Airlines Flight 11's takeoff. 8:19: Betty Ong, a flight attendant on Flight 11 alerts American Airlines via an airphone: \\"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class‚Äîand I think there's Mace‚Äîthat we can't breathe‚ÄîI don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.\\" She then tells of the stabbings of two flight attendants. 8:20: Boston Center flight controllers decide that Flight 11 has probably been hijacked. 8:20: Flight 77, a Boeing 757 with 58 passengers and six crew members, departs from Washington Dulles International Airport, for Los Angeles International Airport. Five hijackers are aboard. 8:21: Flight 11's transponder signal is turned off, but can still be tracked via primary radar by Boston Center. (Prior to the 9/11 Commission's report, news organizations reported this time as 8:13 or immediately thereafter.) 8:24: A radio transmission comes from Flight 11: \\"Eh..... We have some planes. Just stay quiet, and you'll be okay. We are returning to the airport.\\" It is believed Atta mistakenly held a button directing his voice to radio rather than to the plane's cabin as he intended. A few seconds later, Atta's voice says, \\"Nobody move. Everything will be okay. If you try to make any moves, you'll endanger yourself and the airplane. Just stay quiet.\\" Air traffic controllers hear the transmission. 8:25: Boston Center flight controllers alert other flight control centers regarding Flight 11. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) is not yet alerted. 8:26:30: Flight 11 makes a 100-degree turn to the south, following the Hudson River toward New York City.NTSB Report , page. 3 8:29:24: Boston Center alerts the neighboring Cleveland and New York ARTCC's regarding Flight 11. The flight's position is estimated to be fifteen miles (24 km) southwest of Albany. 8:33: Flight 175 reaches its assigned cruising altitude of 31,000 feet. 8:33:59: A third transmission from Flight 11: \\"Nobody move please. We are going back to the airport. Don't try to make any stupid moves.\\" 8:34: Dan Bueno from Boston Center notifies the tower controller at Otis Air National Guard Base at Cape Cod of the hijacking of Flight 11. The controller directs Bueno to contact Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS), the northeast sector of NORAD. The controller then notifies Otis Operations Center that a call from NEADS might be coming. Two F-15 pilots begin to suit up. 8:37: Flight 175 confirms sighting of hijacked Flight 11 to flight controllers, 10 miles (16 km) to its south. 8:37:30: Flight 11 begins a rapid descent at 3,200 feet per minute, starting from an altitude of 29,000 feet. This descent continues until the moment of impact with the North Tower. Half a minute later, having descended one thousand feet, the flight makes a slight southward turn. 8:37:52: Boston Center control notifies NEADS of the hijacking of Flight 11, the first notification received by NORAD that Flight 11 had been hijacked. The controller requests military help to intercept the jetliner. Cockpit view of the World Trade Center towers from the Hudson River, showing the approximate flight path of American Airlines Flight 11 8:41: The FAA's New York Center requests information about Flight 11 over the radio. Flight 175 responds: \\"ah we heard a suspicious transmission on our departure out of Boston ah with someone ah, ah sound like someone sound like someone keyed the mike and said ah 'everyone ah stay in your seats'\\". New York Center acknowledges and says it will pass the information on. 8:42: Flight 93, a Boeing 757, takes off with 37 passengers and seven crew members from Newark International Airport, bound for San Francisco International Airport, following a 40-minute delay due to congested runways. Four hijackers are aboard. Its flight path initially takes it close to the World Trade Center, which is 4 minutes away from being struck, before moving away westwards. 8:42‚Äì8:46 (approx.): Flight 175 is hijacked. 8:43:30: While descending at 10,000 feet, Flight 11 makes a final turn, turning south-southwestward towards New York City, aiming for the World Trade Center. 8:44: Flight attendant Amy Sweeney, aboard Flight 11, reports by telephone to Michael Woodward at the American Airlines Flight Services Office in Dallas, \\"Something is wrong. We are in a rapid descent. We are all over the place.\\" A minute later, Woodward asks her to \\"describe what she sees out the window\\". She responds, \\"I see the water. I see the buildings. I see buildings.\\" After a short pause, she reports, \\"We are flying low. We are flying very, very low. We are flying way too low.\\" Seconds later she says, \\"Oh my God, we are way too low.\\" The call ends with a burst of very loud, sustained static. 8:44:05: Another flight in the area, US Airways Flight 583, reports to New York Center that it received a brief emergency locator transmitter signal on 121.5 MHz. Another flight, Delta Air Lines Flight 2433, confirms a minute later that they also picked up a \\"very faint\\" signal. Though the signals usually activate when a plane has crashed, neither Flight 11 nor Flight 175 have crashed yet. Seconds after American Airlines Flight 11 impacted North Tower 8:46:40: Flight 11 crashes at roughly 466 mph (790 km/h or 219 m/s or 425 knots) into the north face of the North Tower (1 WTC) of the World Trade Center, between floors 93 and 99. The aircraft enters the tower intact. It plows to the building's core, severing all three gypsum-encased stairwells, dragging combustibles with it. A powerful shock wave travels down to the ground and up again. The combustibles and the remnants of the aircraft are ignited by the burning fuel. People below the severed stairwells start to evacuate, but no one above the impact zone is able to do so. BBC correspondent Stephen Evans was sitting in the foyer of the South Tower and described hearing a \\"huge bang like somebody dropped a skip full of rubbish\\" followed by \\"two or three similar huge explosions\\", as the South Tower shook. French filmmakers Jules and Gedeon Naudet and Czech immigrant Pavel Hlava videotape the crash of Flight 11 with their video cameras from different locations. A camera belonging to local New York television station WNYW records the sound, but not the image, of the crash. 8:46:43: Chief of the New York City Fire Department's 1st Battalion, Joseph Pfeifer, makes the first fire department radio message advising the FDNY Manhattan Fire Dispatch Office of the crash. Chief Pfeifer and personnel from other fire companies were several blocks north, on the corner of Church Street and Lispenard Street investigating an odor of gas in the street, and witnessed the attack, along with Jules Naudet, who was accompanying the firefighters at the time: > Battalion 1 Chief (Chief Pfeifer): Battalion 1 to Manhattan. Manhattan > Dispatch: Battalion 1, 'kay. Battalion 1 Chief (Chief Pfeifer): We just had > a plane crash into the upper floor of the World Trade Center. Transmit a 2nd > Alarm and start re-located companies into the area. Manhattan Dispatch: 10-4 > [message received], Battalion 1. 8:46:48: Two F-15 fighter jets are ordered to scramble from Otis Air National Guard Base in Massachusetts, intended to intercept Flight 11. > Major Jeremy Powell: This is HUNTRESS with an active air defense scramble > for Panta 45, 46, time 12:46, authenticate delta x-ray. Scramble > immediately, Panta 45, 46, heading 280, flight level 290, contact HUNTRESS > on frequency 228.9, back-up 364.2. All parties acknowledge with initials. Because Flight 11's transponder is off, the pilots do not know the location of their target. NEADS spends the next several minutes watching their radar screens in anticipation of Flight 11 returning a radar contact. However, unknown to NEADS at the time, Flight 11 has already impacted the North Tower. NEADS will not become aware of the crash at the World Trade Center until 8:50am. 8:47:39: Boston Center and New York Center contact other flight controllers in the area, stating that they have lost Flight 11. Roughly a minute later, New York Center passes on information supplied by Kennedy Tower about a fire at the World Trade Center. > New York Center: Kennedy Tower reports...you serious? Kennedy Tower reports > that there was a fire at the World Trade Center. And that's, ah, that's the > area where we lost the airplane. 8:48‚Äì10:28: Some 100-200 people, primarily in the North Tower, trapped by fire and smoke in the upper floors, jump from the towers. One person at street level, firefighter Daniel Suhr, is hit by a jumper and dies. No form of airborne evacuation is attempted as smoke is too dense for a successful landing on the roof of either tower. 8:48:08: WNYW breaks into a Paramount Pictures movie trailer for Zoolander to make the first broadcast report of an incident at the World Trade Center, less than two minutes after Flight 11's crash. One of the station's camera crews, already having been out on the street that morning for New York's mayoral primary election, takes the first live pictures of black smoke coming from the North Tower. As these pictures are broadcast, the voice of reporter Dick Oliver is heard as he reports from the scene to anchor Jim Ryan, who was not in the studio at the time: Three minutes later, Jim Ryan corrected the location of the first plane crash from the South Tower to the North Tower. 8:48:29: The first radio report of the incident is heard on WCBS-AM through traffic reporter Tom Kaminski. WCBS' traffic reports are delivered every ten minutes \\"on the 8s\\", meaning that Kaminski's traffic report was to come within two minutes of the initial impact of Flight 11 (although there is no record of how much time actually passed). At the time Kaminski was in \\"Chopper 880\\", WCBS' helicopter that he reports from for morning and evening rush hour traffic reports. The following consists of WCBS anchor Pat Carroll crossing to Kaminski in the chopper before he files his report. > Pat Carroll: WCBS news time, 8:48, it's traffic and weather together > sponsored by Henry Miller's Theatre. Tom Kaminski, Chopper 880. Tom > Kaminski: Alright uh, Pat, we are just currently getting a look. at the > World Trade Center, We have something that has happened here at the World > Trade Center.

CNN breaking the news of a plane crash at the World Trade Center 8:49:34: The first network television and radio reports of an explosion or incident at the World Trade Center. CNN breaks into a Ditech commercial at 8:49. The CNN screen subtitle first reads \\"WORLD TRADE CENTER DISASTER\\". Carol Lin, the first TV network anchor to break the news of the attacks, says: Just a minute later, Sean Murtagh, CNN vice president of finance, in an on-air phone call, says from his office in the CNN New York bureau that a large passenger commercial jet was seen to hit the World Trade Center. Murtagh is the first network employee on the air. The first email bulletins of breaking news from CNN and MSNBC report \\"fire at tower of World Trade Center\\". Both CNN and MSNBC's websites receive such heavy traffic that many servers collapse. BBC News' website is active and shows a picture of the North Tower on fire. Minutes later, email news bulletins revise the reports of fire to a plane crash. 8:50: NEADS is notified that a plane has struck the World Trade Center as they continue to try to locate Flight 11 on radar. 8:50: Local New York radio station WOR news anchor Ed Walsh makes that station's first on-air report of the incident. 8:50: WCBS-TV in New York breaks away from the CBS network to cover the attack, with anchor Mike Pomeranz providing that station's first report. 8:50: CNBC interrupts an episode of Squawk Box hosted by Mark Haines with a report of the unfolding attack.CNBC begins reporting. YouTube. 8:50: Local New York cable television channel NY1 anchor Pat Kiernan begins that channel's coverage of the incident. 8:50‚Äì8:54 (approx.): Flight 77 is hijacked. 8:51: Local New York television station WNBC breaks away from the NBC network to begin its coverage of the attack, with anchor Jane Hanson providing that station's initial report. 8:51: Matt Lauer, co-host of NBC News' Today, interrupts an interview with author Richard Hack and says to the audience, \\"We wanna go live right now, and show you a picture of the World Trade Center...we have a breaking story right now...\\" However, NBC did not immediately have the picture ready and went to a regularly scheduled commercial break. They return with a shot of the burning tower. 8:51: A flight controller at the FAA's New York Center notices that Flight 175 had changed its transponder code twice four minutes earlier; he tries to contact the flight. Another flight in the area, Delta Airlines flight 1489, reports the sight of smoke coming from lower Manhattan to New York Center. This is the first word any pilots in flight receive of the incident. 8:51: New York City's Amateur Radio Emergency Service net is activated, with ham operators in the area assisting with emergency communications. 8:51: ABC was airing Good Morning America at the time of the attack. After returning from a commercial break, WABC-TV in New York breaks away from the ABC network, with anchor Steve Bartelstein beginning that station's own local coverage of the disaster, while on the network, GMA host Diane Sawyer makes this statement: > We want to tell you what we know, as we know it, but we just got a report in > that there's been some sort of explosion at the World Trade Center in New > York City. One report said, and we can't confirm any of this, that a plane > may have hit one of the two towers of the World Trade Center, but again, you > are seeing the live pictures here. We have no further details than that. We > don't know anything about what they have concluded happened there this > morning. But we're going to find out, and of course, make sure that > everybody knows on the air.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_K5rSpuXTgg 8:51:34: WINS-AM interrupts its 8:51 traffic report and anchor James Faherty relays word of the crash of Flight 11 to the listening audience, with the station having been notified by one of its employees who lives near the site. 8:52: Lee Hanson receives a phone call from his son, Peter, a passenger on United 175, who says: \\"I think they've taken over the cockpit‚Äîan attendant has been stabbed‚Äîand someone else up front may have been killed. The plane is making strange moves. Call United Airlines‚Äîtell them it's Flight 175, Boston to LA.\\" Also on board Flight 175, a flight attendant calls a United Airlines office in Chicago, reporting that the flight had been hijacked, both pilots had been killed, a flight attendant had been stabbed, and the hijackers were probably flying the plane. 8:52: The F-15s at Otis Air National Guard Base are airborne. Still lacking an intercept vector to Flight 11 (and not aware that it has already crashed), they are sent to military controlled airspace off Long Island and ordered to remain in a holding pattern until between 9:09 and 9:13. 8:52: Anchor Chris Jansing makes the first announcement on MSNBC of a plane crash into the World Trade Center. 8:52: CBS interrupts The Early Show to report the news of the attack. Bryant Gumbel makes the announcement that a plane has crashed into the World Trade Center. 8:52: CBC Newsworld anchor Mark Kelley makes the first Canadian television report of the first plane crash.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIni8YFliqc 8:52: Sky News host Kay Burley breaks the news of the first plane crash to the UK. 8:53: Network Ten news anchor Sandra Sully makes the first report of the incident over Australian television. 8:54: Flight 77 deviates from its assigned course, turning south over Ohio. 8:54: BBC World news anchor Nisha Pillai makes that channel's first report of the disaster. The channel does not start continuous coverage until 9:00. 8:55: Fox News comes back from a commercial break to report the attack. E. D. Hill informs viewers that a plane crashed into the North Tower. 8:55 (approx.): An announcement is made over the building-wide PA system by officials in the still-undamaged South Tower of the World Trade Center, \\"The building is secure, please return to your desks.\\"\\"90th Floor Frozen, Even as Ground Zero Changes\\", The New York Times, September 12, 2007. This announcement is reacted to in numerous ways, ranging from people going back to their offices as suggested, ignoring it and evacuating anyway, or congregating in common areas such as the 78th floor sky lobby. 8:55: President George W. Bush arrives at Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida, as part of a scheduled visit to promote education and is reading The Pet Goat when White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card, who is with Bush, informs him that a small twin-engine plane has crashed into the World Trade Center. Before entering the classroom, the President speaks to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who is at the White House. She first tells him it was a twin-engine aircraft‚Äîand then a commercial aircraft‚Äîthat had struck the World Trade Center, adding \\"that's all we know right now, Mr. President.\\"9/11 Commission Report , p. 35. 8:56: Ten minutes after the North Tower of the World Trade Center was hit by Flight 11, the transponder on Flight 77 is turned off and even primary radar contact with the aircraft is lost. During radar blackout Flight 77 turns east, unnoticed by flight controllers. When primary radar information is restored at 9:05, controllers searching for Flight 77 to the west of its previous position are unable to find it.With its transponder off, it is possible, though more difficult, to track an aircraft by its primary radar returns.

If > things don't go well, and it's not looking good, I just want you to know I > absolutely love you, I want you to do good, go have good times, same to my > parents and everybody, and I just totally love you, and I'll see you when > you get there. Bye, babe. I hope I call you. =9:00 a.m.= The World Trade Center's South Tower burns at 9:03 a.m., moments after being struck by United Airlines Flight 175. 9:00: Lee Hanson receives a second call from his son Peter, aboard Flight 175: > \\"It's getting bad, Dad. A stewardess was stabbed. They seem to have knives > and Mace. They said they have a bomb. It's getting very bad on the plane. > Passengers are throwing up and getting sick.

It's escalating > big, big time. We need to get the military involved with us. ATCSCC: We're, > we're involved with something else, we have other aircraft that may have a > similar situation going on here. 9:01: FAA's New York Center contacts New York terminal approach control and asks for help in locating Flight 175. 9:01: News anchor Lynne White of local New York television station WPIX-TV begins that station's report on the attack.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCgE60nfdxw 9:01: The first Japanese television report of the disaster is made over NHK Television by news anchor Masaaki Horio. 9:02: Evacuation of both World Trade Center towers is ordered by FDNY Battalion Chief Joseph Pfeifer, who was stationed in the lobby of the North Tower. Although it is uncertain whether the South Tower's deputy fire safety director receives this order, an announcement is made over the tower's PA system to \\"begin an orderly evacuation if conditions warranted\\".9/11 Commission Report, p. 289. 9:02:57: Flight 175 crashes at about 590 mph (950 km/h, 264 m/s or 513 knots) into the south face of the South Tower (2 WTC) of the World Trade Center, between floors 77 and 85.Time as given in the 9/11 Commission Report , July 2004, pp. 8, 32. However, Final Report of the Collapse of the World Trade Center Towers , published by the U.S. Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology in September 2005, pp. 83-84, timed this event at 9:02:59 a.m., established from time stamps in four September 11 telecasts. All 65 people on board the aircraft die instantly on impact, and unknown hundreds in the building as well. By this time, several media organizations, including the three major broadcast networks (who have interrupted their morning shows), are covering the first plane crash‚Äîmillions see the impact live. Parts of the plane, including the starboard engine, leave the building from its east and north sides, falling to the ground six blocks away. New York's WNYW is among the first to specifically report that a second plane has crashed into the complex (many other news agencies do not realize that a second plane has crashed until several minutes later):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo-v9Nge6Zwhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PElRJEDMuEhttps://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/29/magazine/29FOB- medium-t.html > Jim Ryan: Oh, my goodness. There's another one. Oh, my goodness. There's > another one! Lyn Brown: This seems to be on purpose. Jim Ryan: Oh, my > goodness. Now you... Kai Simonsen (WNYW helicopter reporter): Was that a > plane? Jim Ryan: Now it's obvious. I think that there's a second plane just > crashed into the World Trade Center. I think we have a terrorist act of > proportions that we cannot begin to imagine at this juncture. Kai Simonsen: > Oh, my God. Jim Ryan: My goodness, a second plane now has crashed into the > other tower of the World Trade Center. Obviously, suicide terrorist attack > on the World Trade Center. What we have, what we have been fearing, what we > have been fearing for the longest time here apparently has come to pass. A > disastrous terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. Both towers, planes > smashing into each one. A massive evacuation begins in the South Tower below its impact zone. One of the stairwells in the South Tower remains unblocked from the top to the bottom of the tower because of the plane hitting at an offset from the vertical center line of the building, but it is filled with smoke. This leads many people to mistakenly go upwards towards the roof for a rooftop rescue that never comes. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey kept the two sets of heavy metal doors leading to the building's only roof exit tightly locked.Paltrow, Scott J., Kim, Queens Sook, Wall St. Journal, Could Helicopters Have Saved People From the Top of the Trade Center? The impact severs communication with several television and radio broadcast towers at the WTC; local station WPIX's satellite feed freezes on an image of the second impact which is all the station broadcasts until alternate transmitters are set up hours later. The affected television stations' terrestrial signals go off the air, however, they continue to broadcast, with their signals still receivable through local cable TV systems in the area, and WCBS-TV having backup transmitter facilities atop the Empire State Building. Because of the North Tower's obstruction of the South Tower from certain camera angles, some are originally unaware that a second plane has struck the South Tower, and instead mistakenly believe that the second explosion has occurred in the North Tower. As instant replays of the second plane crash are shown, the anchors on the three major broadcast networks speculate on whether they are witnessing a terrorist attack or some sort of very rare accident. CNN changes its headline to read \\"Second plane crashes into World Trade Center.\\" On the local station WABC-TV (which CNN was simulcasting at that moment), anchor Steve Bartelstein first assumes that the explosion seen was caused when the fuselage of the first plane exploded.

The elevator had gotten stuck at the 50th Floor when Flight 11 hit the tower. With no exit at this floor, window cleaner Jan Demczur used his squeegee to cut a hole in the Sheetrock lining the elevator shaft, leading to an adjacent bathroom. They are found by firefighters, who immediately escort them to a stairwell. All six successfully leave the tower five minutes before it collapses. 9:32: A radio transmission from Flight 93 is overheard by flight controllers at Cleveland: \\"Ladies and gentlemen here. is the captain please sit down.

All 64 people on board are killed, as are 125 Pentagon personnel. 9:39: Another radio transmission is heard from Ziad Jarrah aboard Flight 93: \\"Uh, this is the captain. I would like you all to remain seated. We have a bomb on board and are going back to the airport, and to have our demands, so please remain quiet.\\" 9:39: Fox News Channel correspondent David Asman reports, \\"We -- we are hearing -- right now that another explosion that -- has taken place.

Transport Canada orders a complete closedown of Canadian airspace, but the Mexican airspace did not shut down. The FAA announces that civilian flights are suspended until at least noon September 12, while Transport Canada gives similar orders; the FAA further ordered that diverted U.S.-bound international flights should be taken in, launching the agency's \\"Operation Yellow Ribbon\\". The groundings would eventually last until September 14. Military and medical flights as well as Con Air flights continue. This is the fourth time all commercial flights in the U.S. have been stopped, and the first time a suspension was unplanned. All previous suspensions were military-related (Sky Shield I-III), from 1960 to 1962. Many newspapers (including The New York Times) mistakenly print that this is the first time flights have been suspended.

Its destruction is viewed and heard by a vast television and radio audience. As the roar of the collapse goes silent, tremendous gray-white clouds of pulverized concrete and gypsum rush through the streets. Most observers think a new explosion or impact has produced smoke and debris that now obscures the South Tower, but once the wind clears the smoke, it becomes clear that the building is no longer there. NY1 correspondent Kristen Shaughnessy, on the scene of the disaster, reports on the collapse of the South Tower at the instant it begins.https://www.youtube.com/watch/zxi2flUfRP8 9:59: As the South Tower collapses, Father Mychal Judge, OFM, chaplain to the FDNY, is struck by falling debris on the lobby level of the North Tower. He dies of blunt force trauma to the head. He is found by Chief Pfeifer, Jules, and others from the North Tower Command Post who fled when they heard the South Tower collapse and took refuge in the nearby escalator as the debris cloud engulfed them. As Judge's body is the first recovered and certified by the medical examiner's office, he will be designated \\"Victim 0001\\" of the September 11 attacks. =10:00 a.m.= 10:00: FDNY Battalion Chief Joseph Pfeifer (inside of the still standing North Tower) orders all FDNY personnel to evacuate, via radio. > Battalion 1 Chief (Chief Pfeifer): Command post, Tower 1, all units. > Evacuate the building. Command post, to all units.Excerpt from Due to many communication limitations, numerous firefighters within the tower do not receive this transmission. Some personnel who do not hear the order only leave the building after being told by other firefighters that an evacuation order has been given. Others never receive the order at all.Executive Summary , p. 7-8 10:01: The FAA Command Center advises FAA headquarters that an aircraft had seen Flight 93 \\"waving his wings,\\" the hijackers' efforts to defeat the passengers' counterattack. 10:02: Communicators with the Vice President in the security bunker begin receiving reports from the Secret Service of an inbound aircraft‚Äîpresumably hijacked‚Äîheading toward Washington.

Baum puts the time of impact at 10:06:05. The 9/11 Commission argued \\"the seismic data on which [Kim and Baum based their] estimate are far too weak in signal-to-noise ratio and far too speculative in terms of signal source to be used as a means of contradicting the impact time [of 10:03] established by the very accurate combination of FDR, CVR, ATC, radar, and impact site data sets (National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, Notes , 1 \\"We Have Some Planes\\", note #168). Black box recordings, radar analysis, satellite data (National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, \\"We Have Some Planes,\\" 1.2 Improvising a Homeland Defense, United Airlines Flight 93) and at least one telephone call indicate 10:03:11. Later reports indicate that passengers had learned about the World Trade Center and Pentagon crashes on cell phones and at least three were planning on resisting the hijackers; the resistance was confirmed by Flight 93's cockpit voice recording, on which the hijackers are heard making their decision to down the plane before the passengers succeed in breaching the cockpit door. The target of flight 93 is thought to be either the US Capitol Building or the White House in Washington D.C. 10:05: Andrea Mitchell, reporting on NBC from outside the Pentagon, reports that Osama bin Laden may have been involved in the attacks. 10:05: CNN's headlines read: \\"SOUTH TOWER AT WTC COLLAPSES.\\" 10:05: The IDS Center in Minneapolis is evacuated. 10:07: NBC reports for the first time that the South Tower of the World Trade Center has collapsed.

This is later revealed to be erroneous. 10:28:22: The North Tower of the World Trade Center collapses. Due to the destruction of the gypsum-encased stairwells on the impact floors (most skyscraper stairwells are encased in reinforced concrete), no one who was above the impact zone in the North Tower escapes the collapse. The Marriott Hotel, located at the base of the two towers, is also destroyed. The second collapse is also viewed live on television and heard on radio. The North Tower collapses 1 hour, 42 minutes after the impact of Flight 11‚Äîthe building had burned during the whole duration of the attacks. 7 World Trade Center burns after the collapse of the North Tower. New York City's 1010 WINS reports the collapse live as it happens, broadcasting a live phone call with WINS news director Ben Mevorach, who witnessed the collapse from the Manhattan Bridge. On NBC News, Katie Couric says: \\"The other tower of the World Trade Center has just collapsed.\\" Several long-distance videos of the collapse, such as CNN, were able to notice that, after the cloud of dust had partially cleared away, a portion of the building was still standing. It appeared to be the lower half of the northwest corner column of the North Tower, which, like a spire, grew larger and had more structure still standing near the bottom. The portion rose to a fairly good height considering the collapse around it, as it appeared to rise nearly forty stories off the ground. This piece remained standing for a few seconds after the initial collapse before it also came down. 10:31: NORAD first communicates the Vice President's shootdown authority to NEADS. 10:35: Air Force One, carrying the President, turns for Barksdale Air Force Base in Bossier City, Louisiana. 10:37: Associated Press reports that officials at the Somerset County airport confirm that a large plane has crashed in western Pennsylvania.

The Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, is evacuated and closed. New York City's 1010 WINS relays a report that the U.S. State Department headquarters in Washington, D.C. has been attacked by a car bomb. This is later reported to be false. 10:39: Another hijacked jumbo jet is claimed to be headed for Washington, D.C. F-15s are scrambled and patrol the airspace above Washington, D.C. while other fighter jets sweep the airspace above New York City. They have orders, first issued by Vice President Cheney and later confirmed by President Bush, to shoot down any potentially dangerous planes that do not comply with orders given to them via radio. Eventually, the aircraft is revealed to be a medevac helicopter on its way to the Pentagon. 10:41: NBC News confirms that a plane has \\"gone down\\" in Somerset County. The earlier unconfirmed statements about an incident at the State Department in Washington, D.C. are reported as false. 10:43: CNN reports that a mass evacuation of Washington, D.C., and New York has been started. A few minutes later, New York mayor Rudy Giuliani orders an evacuation of Lower Manhattan. 10:49: Fox News Channel is the first of the United States news networks to implement a news ticker at the bottom of its screen for supplementary information about the attacks.

In his lifetime he was considered the leading watchmaker of his day, and he built up a clientele that included many leading public figures and members of the European nobility. Alongside his friend and contemporary John Arnold, Breguet is now widely acknowledged as one of the greatest horologists of all time.Mike Disher, \\"Breguet at the Louvre\\", WatchTime.com, 29 July 2009 One of his famous ancestors was Jean Breguet (who died in 1593) a Protestant pastor in Neuch√¢tel very much influenced by the ideas of John Calvin. He is the founder of the Breguet company, which is now the luxury watch division of the Swiss Swatch Group.  Life  Breguet was born in Neuch√¢tel to Jonas-Louis Breguet and Suzanne-Marguerite Bollein. Breguet's father died in 1758, when he was ten, and his formal schooling ended when he was 12. Breguet's mother remarried to Joseph Tattet, who came from a family of watchmakers. Tattet had a showroom in Paris; the family tried for some time to entice the young Breguet into the trade, to no avail, but he eventually took to it with great interest and in 1762, aged 15, he was sent to be apprenticed to an unknown Versailles master watchmaker. At this time the Court had a great influence on the trade and the best watchmakers established themselves around Versailles. The young Breguet soon \\"astonished\\" his master with his aptitude and intelligence, and to further his education he took evening classes in mathematics at the Coll√®ge Mazarin under Abb√© Marie, who became a friend and mentor to the young watchmaker. Through his role as tutor to the dukes of Angoul√™me and de Berri, Abb√© Marie was able to arrange for Breguet to be introduced to King Louis XVI of France, and the king's interest in mechanics led to many royal commissions for the rising watchmaker, including a perpetuelle (self-winding watch), with which the king was especially pleased.Salomons, 1921, p.11 Unfortunately, Marie met a tragic end, either through murder or suicide, and soon after Breguet lost both his mother and his step-father, leaving him to support himself and his younger sister. How he managed this in the period between his parents' deaths and the establishment of his business is unknown.David Salomons, Breguet 1747-1823, (London, 1921, privately published), p.9-10 Breguet was allowed to marry in 1775 after finishing his apprenticeship. He and his bride, C√©cile Marie-Louise L'Huillier, set up their home and the Breguet watchmaking company; its first known address was at 51, quai de l'Horloge in the √éle de la Cit√© in Paris (by the 1920s this location was designated as #39). Ca. 1812 the firm's address was 79, quai de l'Horloge du Palais, although Salomons speculated that this might have been merely a change of number and name, not of actual location. By the year of Breguet's death in 1823 the firm also had a shop at 4, place de la Bourse, which is known because both addresses appear on the label of watch #4004. The firm later moved to Rue de la Paix and in the early 20th century to 2, rue √âdouard-VII.Salomons, 1921, p.8 Breguet invented innovative escapements, including the tourbillon, automatic winding mechanisms, pages 110-121, 362-370. and the overcoil (an improvement of the balance spring with a raised outer coil). Within ten years Breguet had commissions from the aristocratic families of France and even the French queen, Marie-Antoinette. C√©cile died in 1780. He met Abraham-Louis Perrelet in Switzerland and became a Master Clockmaker in 1784. In 1787 Abraham-Louis established a partnership with Xavier Gide, which lasted until 1791. Ca. 1792 the Duke of Orl√©ans went to England and met John Arnold, Europe's leading watch and clockmaker. The Duke showed Arnold a clock made by Breguet, who was so impressed that he immediately travelled to Paris and asked Breguet to accept his son as an apprentice.Salomons, 1921, p.10 As Breguet's fame gradually increased he became friendly with revolutionary leader Jean- Paul Marat, who also hailed from Neuch√¢tel. Salomons' biography records that Marat and Breguet were at the house of a mutual friend one day when an angry crowd gathered outside, shouting \\"Down with Marat!\\", but Breguet contrived their escape by disguising Marat as an old woman, and they left the house arm in arm, unmolested. In 1793 Marat discovered that Breguet was marked for the guillotine, possibly because of his friendship with Abb√© Marie (and/or his association with the royal court); in return for his own earlier rescue, Marat arranged for a safe-pass that enabled Breguet to escape to Switzerland, from where he travelled to England. He remained there for two years, during which time he worked for King George III. When the political scene in France stabilised, Breguet returned to Paris. In 1795 Breguet returned to Paris with many ideas for innovations in watch and clock making. He set up business again in Quai de l'Horloge and quickly established a reputation among the new wealthy classes in the Empire. Breguet did not staff his workshops in the traditional way, with unskilled apprentices, but instead sought out the finest available watchmakers in Paris, whom he employed to make watches to his own designs. At the 1798 Exposition des produits de l'industrie fran√ßaise Breguet was given an honorable distinction, the highest award, for \\"a free escapement with constant force, applicable to the improvement of both astronomical clocks and longitude clocks. This clock has the very singular effect of resetting the time in a watch.\\" Circa 1807 Breguet brought in his son, Antoine-Louis (born 1776) as a business partner, and from this point the firm became known as Breguet et FilsSalomons, 1921, p.7 Breguet had previously sent his son to London to study with the great English chronometer maker, John Arnold, and such was the mutual friendship and respect between the two men that Arnold, in turn, sent his son, John Roger, to spend time with Breguet. Breguet met another watchmaker Louis Moinet, recognised his worth at once, and the two men worked closely together. From 1811 on, Moinet became Breguet's personal adviser. Breguet became a member of the Bureau des Longitudes in 1814 and the following year gained an official appointment as chronometer-maker to the French Navy. He entered the French Academy of Sciences in 1816 as a full member, and received the Chevalier of the Legion of Honour from the hands of Louis XVIII in 1819. Breguet's name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower. In 1822 the future engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, then aged sixteen, studied for some months with Breguet in Paris. Brunel had a French father so he spoke perfect French. According to Salomons' biography, Breguet was known for his kindness and good humour. It is recorded that if a workman came to Breguet with a finished piece of work and an invoice for payment, and Breguet was satisfied with the work, then if the invoice ended in a zero, Breguet would add a tail to the zero to make it a '9', thereby enabling the workman to be paid nine francs more than he had asked for. He was also known for his encouragement of his young apprentices, often advising them \\"Do not be discouraged, or allow failure to dishearten you.\\"Salomons, 1921, p.11 The business grew from strength to strength, and when Abraham-Louis Breguet died in 1823 it was carried on by Louis-Antoine. After Antoine-Louis retired in 1833 (he died in 1858) the business continued under Abraham-Louis' grandson Louis Fran√ßois Cl√©ment Breguet (1804‚Äì1883); his great-grandson Louis Antoine (1851‚Äì1882) was the last of the Breguet family to run the business. Although he had two sons and a daughter, they did not enter the business, so he took on noted English watchmaker Edward Brown of Clerkenwell to look after the Paris factory. Brown eventually became his partner and, after Breguet's death, the owner and head of the company. His sons Edward and Henry Brown headed the firm into the 20th century and after Edward retired in the early 1900s, Henry became the sole proprietor.Salomons, 1921, pp.7-8  Works and influence  Breguet made three series of watches, and the highest numbering of the three reached 5120, so in all it is estimated that the firm produced around 17,000 timepieces during Breguet's life. Because of his minute attention to detail and his constant experimentation, no two Breguet pieces are exactly alike. Following his introduction to the court, Queen Marie-Antoinette developed a fascination for Breguet's unique self-winding watch and Louis XVI of France bought several pieces.Mike Disher, \\"Breguet at the Louvre\\", WatchTime.com, 29 July 2009 His achievements soon attracted a wealthy and influential clientele that comprised a veritable \\"Who's Who\\" of the period: Louis XVI and his Queen Marie-Antoinette, Napoleon Bonaparte, Jos√©phine de Beauharnais, Louis XVIII, Alexander I of Russia, George IV of the United Kingdom, Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. Legend has it that it was the ill-fated French queen herself who commissioned Breguet's masterpiece, the \\"Marie Antoinette\\" (No. 160), which is now widely regarded as one of the most important and valuable timepieces ever made. In fact, it was commissioned in 1783 by a member of the Marie-Antoinette Guards, possibly as a gift for the queen, and it took almost twenty years to complete‚Äîwork stopped for around seven years (1789‚Äì1795) during the period of Breguet's exile‚Äîand it was not finished until around 1802. Even by the standards of the day it was an astronomically expensive piece; the commission specifically called for every watch function and complication known at that time and the use of the most valuable materials (including gold, platinum, rubies and sapphires), with no limit placed on time or cost. Breguet company records indicate that the factory costs eventually came to the colossal sum of 30,000 francs ‚Äì more than six times the cost of Breguet's other major work, (No. 92), which was sold to the Duc De Preslin for 4800 francs. The \\"Marie Antoinette\\" remained in the possession of the Breguet company until it was sold to Sir Spencer Brunton in 1887, eventually finding its way into the collection of Breguet expert David Lionel Goldsmid-Stern- Salomons in the 1920s.David Salomons, Breguet 1747-1823 (privately published, 1921), p.46 Breguet's most remarkable piece anticipated the wristwatch by a century; he designed this, together with his friend John Arnold, for Caroline Bonaparte, Queen of Naples, in 1810. Many honours recognised his enormous contribution to horology. Each watch from his workshops demonstrated the latest horological improvements in an original movement, mostly fitted with lever or ruby-cylinder escapements that he perfected. Breguet took refuge in Switzerland from the excesses of the French Revolution. He returned to Paris overflowing with the ideas that produced the Breguet balance-spring, his first carriage clock (sold to House of Bonaparte), the sympathique clock and its dependent watch, the tact watch, and finally the tourbillon, patented in 1801. Although Breguet is probably best known for his luxury watches and carriage clocks, he also made a number of important scientific clocks. In 1818 Lieutenant-General Thomas Brisbane, a keen amateur astronomer, purchased a Breguet mean-time regulator clock (No. 3180, 1815‚Äì1820). It is thought that Breguet originally made the clock for the French Commission of Longitude, but sold it to Brisbane for use in his observatory at Largs in Scotland. It cost Brisbane the considerable sum of 2,500 francs, and the fact he chose to buy French rather British, even in the nationalistic political climate of the early nineteenth century, gives some idea of how well regarded Breguet was internationally. Brisbane brought the clock to Australia in 1821 and it was installed in Australia's first astronomical observatory at Parramatta. The New South Wales government purchased the clock from Brisbane when he returned to England in 1825 and it remained in use there until the Parramatta observatory closed in 1847. It was put into storage for a decade before being reinstalled in the new government observatory at The Rocks, and was one of the few instruments that the new Government Astronomer, Rev. W. Scott, felt was good enough to use in the new observatory. It remained in use there for another 70 years, until it was replaced in 1912. The clock is now part of the collection of the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney.Powerhouse Museum, Breguet mean-time regulator clock, 1815‚Äì1820  The Salomons Collection  British philanthropist, scientist and MP Sir David Lionel Goldsmid-Stern-Salomons (1851‚Äì1925) developed a lifelong passion for horology and he became one of the leading authorities on Breguet and his timepieces. In 1921 he published the seminal volume, Breguet 1747‚Äì1823, the first major book on the subject, which included a biography, an analysis of Breguet's key inventions, listings of major pieces, and a detailed timeline of production, using examples from his own unique collection for illustrations. Over his lifetime, Salomons amassed the world's largest private Breguet collection, which ultimately grew to 124 pieces, including what are considered to be the two greatest examples of Breguet's watchmaking work ‚Äì the \\"Marie Antionette\\" and the double-faced \\"Duc de Praslin\\" watches. In 1924 Salomons donated the \\"Duc de Praslin\\" (pictured at left) to the Mus√©e des Techniques du Conservatoire National des Arts et M√©tiers in Paris, but it was subsequently stolen. Fortunately, after three months of tinkering with the watch, the thief was apprehended when he took it to a renowned Parisian watch specialist for repair. Breguet watch No. 92 (1785), bought by the Duc de Choiseul-Praslin. Mus√©e des Arts et M√©tiers. After Salomons' death in 1925, his daughter Vera donated 57 of his best Breguet pieces, including the \\"Marie Antoinette\\" and a \\"Sympathiques\\" clock to the L.A. Mayer Institute for Islamic Art in Jerusalem, which was founded by her brother. Salomons left the remainder of the collection to his wife, who eventually sold them at auction, although according to one account, she was initially rebuffed when she approached Sotheby's, because the staffer with whom she dealt could not believe that someone \\"off the street\\" could possibly have amassed such a collection. In 1980, British master horologist George Daniels (widely regarded as the most important watchmaker since Breguet) catalogued the Breguet watches and clocks in the museum, and published a study on them. Three years later, on the night of 15 April 1983, the Mayer Institute was burgled and 106 rare timepieces, including the entire Salomons collection, were stolen. The audacious multimillion-dollar theft was Israel's largest-ever robbery ‚Äì by this time, the \\"Marie Antoinette\\" alone was valued at US$30 million. There was a substantial insurance payout, but the case remained unsolved until August 2006, when the perpetrator was revealed as Namaan Diller, a notorious Israeli burglar who had fled to the USA after the break- in. Just before he died in 2004, Diller had confessed his crime to his wife, Nili Shamrat, and in August 2006 she attempted to sell a batch of the stolen items (including the \\"Marie Antoinette\\" watch and a Breguet \\"Sympathique\\" clock) back to the museum, although her initial asking price of $2 million was eventually cut down to just US$35,000. When police searched the couple's Los Angeles home, more of the missing items were found, and documents recovered led them to safes and storage units in France, the Netherlands and Israel; by 2008 all but ten of the items Diller stole from the Mayer Museum had been recovered.Aron Heller, \\"Police solve 25-year-old mystery of Marie Antoinette's watch\\", The Guardian, 5 November 2008Sarna, Igal (21 November 2008). \\"The strange story of Marie Antoinette's self-winding watch\\", The Week\\"Museum theft - woman convicted in case of stolen Antoinette watch\\", Museum Security Network, 3 March 2010  2011 montre √† tact discovery  In 2011 a member of the public brought in a pocket watch to be assessed by the experts of the BBC TV series Antiques Roadshow at Blair Castle in Perthshire, Scotland. Roadshow expert Richard Price stated that the timepiece was an early Breguet montre √† tact (\\"tactile watch\\"), dating from 1801. The watch was enclosed on both sides by discs covered with a blue translucent enamel over a Guilloch√© base machined in a chevron pattern. The front face was fitted with a single arrow-shaped hand in silver, encrusted with small diamonds, and the case was surrounded by twelve large diamonds enclosed by a wavy gold band, which was faced with lighter blue enamel. The enameled back hinged open to reveal a gold cover plate and a smaller two-handed watch face. The mechanism cover bore the engraved signature of Breguet and also bore the mark of Recordon, his London agent at the time (suggesting that it was originally made for an English client). The gold cover plate protected the mechanism, which bore another signature by Breguet, and the watch number. Price then revealed that a similar watch, in much worse condition and with all the gems stripped from it, had recently sold for over UK‚Ç§20,000. He declared the newly discovered Breguet to be the greatest watch he had ever seen in his 28 years with the programme, and assessed its value as at least UK‚Ç§50,000, although it may be worth considerably more ‚Äì another example sold for US$288,000, while a montre √† tact of very similar design, commissioned by Napoleon's wife Jos√©phine de Beauharnais for her sister Hortense, was sold by Christie's in Geneva for US$1.3 million in 2007. Breguet invented the montre √† tact in 1799. Although these single-hand \\"tact\\" watches are sometimes called \\"blind man's watches\\", few blind people of that era could have afforded such luxury items, and these timepieces were designed for Breguet's wealthiest clients. The montre √† tact (touch watch) enabled them to tell the time without removing the watch from their pocket because, in that period, it was considered highly impolite to consult one's watch during a social gathering. The device also enabled owners to tell the time in the dark. This was done by turning the front disc clockwise until it went no further (because of the cam inside) and then feeling at which hour marker (indicated by the surrounding circle of jewels) the watch hand was positioned. In the case of the 2011 discovery, the 12 o'clock position was marked by the chain attachment. The watch was also fitted with a small internal dial with two normal hands so that the exact time could be read when the case was opened.\\"The Timeless Beauty of Breguet\\" , Lumbers Jewellers  Timeline of Breguet's works  * 1775‚Äì1780 Improved the automatic winding mechanism ‚Äì his perpetual watch. * 1783 Invented the gong for repeater watches (bells were used until then). * 1783 Designed the apple- shaped (aiguilles √† pomme) hands, known as 'Breguet' hands.

Generally speaking, Abraham-Louis Breguet was distinguished by the highest attention paid to aesthetic watch design. In 2009 the Louvre in Paris presented a major exhibition of Breguet's work, arranged chronologically, with 146 exhibits in eight sections that covered every phase of his career. Highlights included some of Breguet's most complicated watches: * No. 45, which displays both the Gregorian and the Republican \\"decimal\\" calendars (Breguet made only three Republican calendar timepieces) * No. 1160, the replica of the famous No. 160 \\"Marie-Antoinette\\", * Perp√©tuelle self-winding watches * multiple original tourbillons, including an unusual large-scale demonstration tourbillon later purchased by King George IV of the United Kingdom * examples of the \\"pare- chute\\" shock-protection system, constant force escapements * a superb Sympathique watch and clock set from the personal collection of Queen Elizabeth II.

At the , Humpty Doo had a population of 4,380 people. Its local government area is Litchfield Municipality. The town is a popular stopping point for tourists travelling between Darwin and Kakadu National Park, and boasts many attractions of its own. The main industries are agriculture and tourism; however, most residents commute to Darwin or Palmerston for work, and many regard it as a dormitory town. Origin of the name It has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names. The locality of Humpty Doo is named after the station originally called \\"Umpity Doo\\"; however, origins of the name are uncertain. The following derivations have been suggested: #from \\"the Army slang term \\"umpty\\" used in 1917 for the dash when reading Morse code\\" (however, the station name was in use in 1910) #from a colloquialism to describe \\"everything done wrong or upside down\\" #the place was known as \\"Umdidu\\", an English language corruption of an Aboriginal term which meant a popular resting place #from the translation of aboriginal English that described the area as being the location of \\"humpy two\\", as in, two humpies History The Djerimanga (also known as Woolner) people are recognised as the traditional owners and first inhabitants of an area, from the present day site of Humpty Doo east into the Adelaide River wetlands. Their way of life remained unchanged until the first contact with European explorers in the 19th century, most likely during the 1864 expedition to explore the areas surrounding the Adelaide River, led by Boyle Travers Finniss. In September 1869, Surveyor General of South Australia, George Goyder, completed work to divide the hinterland surrounding the present day Litchfield Shire into parcels. These parcels were subsequently divided into smaller allotments, and made available to settlers as pastoral leases and freehold titles. Following the discovery of gold near Pine Creek during the 1880s, the subsequent influx of Chinese miners to the Northern Territory led to a high demand for food crops such as rice. Rice planted on the floodplains near Humpty Doo was used to meet this demand, with some success.\\"Humpty Doo\\",\\"The Sydney Morning Herald\\", Sydney, 8 February 2004 Experiments with other tropical crops, including sugar cane, coffee and rubber, were attempted, most of these planted in the vicinity of Beatrice Hill to the east of the present day town. Experiments were made with livestock too and it was hoped that the banks of the Adelaide River could be developed to include loading facilities for live cattle export. By 1887, plantations on the floodplains had been abandoned due to the financial difficulties of the land owners. Despite this, rubber trees and coffee bushes showed particular potential. A single harvest of 10 tons of coffee beans was exported to Melbourne during the short lived experiment.Litchfield Council \\"Agriculture at Beatrice Hill\\" In 1910, the name \\"Umpity Doo\\" first appeared, to describe buildings and improvements on a survey plan of Agricultural Lease No. 28, held by Oscar Herbert. Herbert died in 1974 at nearby Koolpinyah Station. In 1954, after some experimentation by CSIRO and based on previous successful rice crops, a joint Australia-U.S. company called Territory Rice Ltd. was formed, with a plan to irrigate the sub-coastal plain of the Adelaide River in order to commercially produce rice. The rice project was 20 km east of the present town, on part of the Humpty Doo Station where the name \\"Humpty Doo\\" was first used. The plan was a complete failure due to several factors: an invasion of geese, soil that was too saline, and an insufficient amount of drainage, all combined with poor management. The company gave up the land to the government in 1962. The irrigation dam, called Fogg Dam, still exists and is a good site for bird watching. Local resident, Neville Skewes, opened a small store on Mount Bundey Road (now the Arnhem Highway) in 1967. At this time, there was very little development, with most of the surrounding area being bushland. On 11 September 1971, after being granted a liquor licence, Skewes and his wife Helen opened the Humpty Doo Hotel-Motel. The opening of the Hotel coincided with further improvements to the road east to Kakadu and Arnhem Land, and encouraged further urbanisation of the area around Humpty Doo. In 1982, the Royal Australian Navy opened the Humpty Doo Transmitting Station. This replaced a facility at Coonawarra East that was destroyed by Cyclone Tracy in December 1974. The station supports the naval base , located in Darwin. On 21 July 2007, the town played host to the first of the 'Triple J goes AWOL' concerts, sponsored and organised by the national youth radio station Triple J. Climate Humpty Doo, like the rest of the outer Darwin area, experiences a tropical savannah climate (K√∂ppen Aw), with two distinct seasons. The wet season is when the highest rainfall occurs and runs from November‚ÄìDecember through until April. During these months the area is subject to the effects of monsoon troughs and there is the threat of tropical cyclones. The wet season is characterised by higher average temperatures, high humidity, and a greater proportion of rainy days and often associated thunderstorms. The dry season from May to October brings lower humidity, significantly cooler overnight temperatures, and minimal rainfall. It is characterised by sunny days with clear skies. Economy The town is known for agriculture experiments that have occurred, including the failed rice crops of the 1950s. A more successful agricultural experiment was the growing of mangos. Top-quality fruit from Humpty Doo is picked earlier than Queensland mangos and fetches a top price in southern markets. There is a honey farm located in outer Humpty Doo, Humpty Doo Apiaries. Infrastructure=Education= There are several schools in Humpty Doo catering for students in Transition through to Year 12. Humpty Doo Primary School, located on Freds Pass Rd, is a public school for Transition - Year 6 students. The site also has a pre-school and offers after an after school childcare program. The school includes students from diverse ethnic backgrounds: 15% of students identify as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders, another 25% of the student population are from Vietnamese, Thai, Filipino, Indonesian, Cambodian, Spanish, Dutch, or Chinese language backgrounds. There were 394 students enrolled at the school as of August 2010. Saint Francis of Assisi School and Early Learning Centre on Challenor Circuit is a Catholic school that provides an alternative for students in Transition to Year 7. The school was established in 1997 and draws enrollments from across the rural outer Darwin. As of 2012, the total student enrollment is approximately 160. The principal is Neal Maxwell. The town has a public secondary school, Taminmin College, formerly Taminmin High School. Established in 1983, the college provides middle years schooling for students in Years 7 - 9, a senior college for Years 10 - 12 and Vocational Education and Training (VET) pathways. Student enrollments are drawn from an area of over 7000sq km. School facilities include a 150ha conservation area for the study of conservation and land management, a 75ha mixed produce and livestock farm for agricultural studies, an air-conditioned gymnasium, sports fields, and a library which is open to students and the wider Humpty Doo community. The school prepares senior students to sit their [NTCE] examinations, as well as having programs in place to provide vocational pathways such as trade apprenticeships on completion of studies. The current principal is Mrs. Miriam McDonald.Taminimin High School website http://www.taminmin.nt.edu.au/ As of August 2010, there were 1049 students enrolled at the college. Tertiary and further vocational education and training are available through Charles Darwin University, with campuses in both Darwin and Palmerston. =Public transport= In January 2012, the Northern Territory Government opened a new $900,000 bus interchange park and ride facility to provide better public transport services for commuters travelling between the rural area, Darwin and Palmerston. This development includes: *15m x 30m (49ft x 98ft) shaded bus/drop off terminal with seating *CCTV surveillance *a self-cleaning toilet *water bubbler *irrigated landscaping *secure push bike enclosure *46 car park bays *four motor cycle parking bays *two disabled parking bays *an undercover bicycle shed accommodating up to 20 bikes. Darwinbus provide 12 buses on weekdays and 6 on Saturdays. A return trip to either Darwin or Palmerston costs $4. The following bus routes operate to the Humpty Doo park and ride as of April 2012: *Express Route 28 - Humpty Doo to Darwin via Coolalinga and Palmerston Interchange (and reverse) - Monday to Friday *Route 440 - Humpty Doo to Humpty Doo via Virginia, Noonamah, and Palmerston - Monday to Saturday *Route 445 - Humpty Doo to Palmerston via Cox Peninsula, Noonamah, and Coolalinga (PM service reversed) - Monday to Saturday *Route 447 - Humpty Doo to Palmerston via McMinns Lagoon and Howard Springs (PM service reversed) - Monday to Saturday *Route 450 - Humpty Doo to Palmerston via Girraween and Howard Springs (PM service reversed) - Monday to Saturday Special events buses also run from this interchange. There are currently no services on Sunday. On the day of the , only 3.4% of employed people travelled to work on public transport and 72.5% by car (either as driver or as passenger). =Utilities= The Humpty Doo waste transfer station is one of three waste management and recycling facilities operated by the Shire of Litchfield, and is the only station accommodating commercial waste. It is open 7 days per week. There is a fee that applies for commercial users. Non-recyclable waste is compacted and transferred to the Shoal Bay Waste Management Facility. The facility is capable of handling cardboard and paper, glass bottles, whitegoods, steel, plastic containers, aluminium cans, cardboard, green waste, and oil.http://www.litchfield.nt.gov.au/uploads/2012-01-06%20Information%20Flyer%20and%20Mud%20Map_A5.pdf Attractions The Humpty Doo Hotel is well known and features in several bush ballads, including \\"The Man from Humpty Doo\\" by Ted Egan and \\"Humpty Doo Waltz\\" by Slim Dusty. It opened in 1971, survived Cyclone Tracy in 1974 and has since become a local icon. In addition to comfortable visitor accommodation, the hotel features a bar area with open walls, a concrete floor, and an iron roof. Local live music acts regularly perform here. Another tourist attraction is the Big Boxing Crocodile outside the United fuel station (formerly known as the Bush Shop) on the Arnhem Highway. This humorous attraction is a reference to the large crocodile population in the area and is one of the many famous \\"big things\\" found around Australia. Graeme Gow's Reptile World is also an attractive stop for tourists on their way to Kakadu, with a collection of at least 300 species of snake The Fogg Dam Conservation Reserve is approximately 25 km (15.5 mi) east of the town and can be accessed off the Arnhem Highway. The reserve is situated on the Adelaide River floodplains, and is one of few publicly accessible natural wetland environments in the Top End all year round. The reserve is a wildlife refuge, and is significant both as a remnant of the failed Territory Rice Ltd venture, and its cultural significance to the local Aboriginal people. Fogg Dam Conservation Reserve features many walking trails and observation areas. Ranger guided activities are also available. At the end of the wet season, in around March‚ÄìApril, native wading birds including jabirus can be observed in large numbers near the dam wall. Wishart Siding, a heritage listed relic of the North Australia Railway is located near the junction of the Stuart and Arnhem Highways a short distance west of town. The site dates back to 1915 and was used as an accommodation facility for maintenance workers when the line was operational. It is the only facility remaining of its kind along the alignment of the former railway.Australian Heritage Places Inventory The Window on the Wetlands Visitor Centre overlooks the wetlands of the Adelaide River floodplain. The centre sits on top of Beatrice Hill the site of several failed agricultural experiments. Visitors to the centre receive an introduction to the eco-systems of the Northern Coastal Wetlands region. The centre features interactive touch screen displays about the native wildlife and local history, and there is an observation deck on the top floor that provides the best views of the surrounding environment, culturally significant to the local Aboriginal people. Entry is free and the centre is open all year round, 7 days a week. The building itself is designed to blend into the natural contours of the landscape.NRETAS website \\"Visitor Centre\\" , Northern Territory Government, 2012 Notable residents The World Wrestling Entertainment character Outback Jack‚Äìportrayed by Peter Stilsbury between 1986 and 1988‚Äìwas billed as coming from Humpty Doo. The character was an outback bushman in the vein of Crocodile Dundee. More recently, Nev Sharp gained some prominence as a challenger to the UK's Paul Hunn's Guinness World Records- record of loudest burp. Trivia The 9th Fighter Squadron of the 49th Fighter Group attached to the United States' 5th Air Force gained the nickname \\"Humpty Doo Fighters\\" while stationed in the area in 1942. The squadron was accommodated in a camp referred to by Lucien Hubbard as Humpty Doo after the cattle station with the same name while acting as a publicity correspondent. The actual campsite location was further south than the township of Humpty Doo, to the east of Noonamah. A vertebrate rhabdovirus isolated from the midge Lasiohelea spp. at Humpty Doo is referred to as the \\"Humpty Doo virus\\". No cases of human infection by Humpty Doo virus are known. In the literature of virology, it is only referenced as infecting kangaroos. A bacterial species of the genus Burkholderia was first isolated during routine screening of a water well in Humpty Doo. Burkholderia humptydooensis has been proposed as its taxonomic name. From September 2009 to December 2009, the numbers station Cherry Ripe is believed to have been broadcast from Humpty Doo until its discontinuation.

Hell is a post town with two post codes: 7517 for delivery route addresses and 7570 for post- office boxes. Hell currently has a grocery store, gas station, a fast food shop, and a retirement home. Until late 1995, the European route E6 highway was aligned through Hell and across the Hell bridge to Sandf√¶rhus (nearby is the Trondheim Airport, V√¶rnes). The new road now goes around the village. Name Sign at Hell Rail Station The village of Hell has become a minor tourist attraction because of its name, as visitors often have their photograph taken in front of the station sign. A smaller building on the railway station has been given the sign ', which is the archaic spelling of the word for \\"goods handling\\". (' would be the spelling in the contemporary Norwegian language). The name Hell stems from the Old Norse word hellir, which means \\"overhang\\" or \\"cliff cave\\".

She is often referred to as the \\"heroine of Nili.\\" Biography Aaronsohn with Abraham in 1914 Sarah Aaronsohn was born and died in Zichron Yaakov, which at the time was part of Ottoman Syria. Her parents were Zionists from Romania who had come to Ottoman Palestine as some of the first settlers of the First Aliyah and were founders of the moshav where Aaronsohn was born. Encouraged by her brother Aaron, she studied languages and was fluent in Hebrew, Yiddish, Turkish and French, had reasonable command of Arabic and taught herself English. She married Haim Abraham, an older and affluent merchant from Bulgaria, and lived briefly with him in Istanbul; but the marriage was an unhappy one and she returned home to Zichron Yaakov in December 1915. On her way from Istanbul to Haifa, Aaronsohn witnessed part of the Armenian genocide. She testified to seeing hundreds of bodies of Armenian men, women, children, and babies; sick Armenians being loaded onto trains; with the dead being tossed out and replaced by the living. After her trip to Haifa, any allusions to Armenians upset her greatly. According to Chaim Herzog, Aaronsohn decided to assist British forces as a result of what she had witnessed. Pro-British espionage Feinberg and Aaronsohn in 1916 Aaronsohn, her sister Rivka Aaronsohn, and her brothers Aaron Aaronsohn and Alexander Aaronsohn, with their friend (and fianc√© of Rivka) Avshalom Feinberg formed and led the Nili spy organization. Aaronsohn oversaw operations in Palestine of the spy-ring and passed information to British agents offshore. Sometimes she travelled widely through Ottoman territory collecting information useful to the British, and brought it directly to them in Egypt. In 1917, her brother Alex urged her to remain in British-controlled Egypt, expecting hostilities from Ottoman authorities; but Aaronsohn returned to Zichron Yaakov to continue Nili activities. Nili developed into the largest pro-British espionage network in the Middle East, with a network of about 40 spies. Torture and suicide Sarah Aaronsohn's (right) and her mother's graves at the Zikhron cemetery in Israel In September 1917, the Ottomans intercepted her carrier pigeon carrying a message to the British and decrypted the Nili code. In October, the Ottomans surrounded Zichron Yaakov and arrested numerous people, including Aaronsohn. Her captors tortured her father in front of her. She endured four days of torture herself, but she gave no information beyond what she thought of her torturers. Before she was to be transferred to Damascus for further torture, she asked permission to return to her home in Zichron Yaakov to change her blood-stained clothes. While there, she managed to shoot herself with a pistol concealed under a tile in the bathroom.Auron, Yair (2001). The Banality of Indifference. Routledge. pp. 179‚Äì80. Kahana, Ephraim (2006). Historical dictionary of Israeli intelligence. Scarecrow Press. p. xix. According to Scott Anderson, in his book Lawrence in Arabia, Aaronsohn shot herself in the mouth on Friday 5 October 1917. \\"Even this did not end the torment of Sarah Aaronsohn. While the bullet destroyed her mouth and severed her spinal cord, it missed her brain. For four days she lingered in agony.\\" In Spies in Palestine, James Srodes quotes the diary of Dr.Hillel Yaffe as saying that Sarah pleaded with him, \\"For heaven's sake, put an end to my life. I beg you, kill me‚Ä¶I can't suffer any longer‚Ä¶.\\" Instead, Dr. Yaffee administered morphine.Srodes, James (2016). Spies in Palestine. Berkeley: Counterpoint Press, p. 175. . She died on 9 October 1917. In her last letter, she expressed her hope that her activities in Nili would bring nearer the realization of a national home for the Jews in Eretz Israel. Because of the Jewish views on suicide, Aaronsohn was denied a traditional burial in a Jewish cemetery. However, refusing a Jewish burial for a Jewish war hero was naturally unpopular. As a compromise, a small fence was placed around her grave in the cemetery (symbolically removing her grave from the surrounding hallowed ground). Legacy Following her death, Aaronsohn became widely commemorated. She was the first example of a \\"secular, active death of a Jewish-Zionist woman for the nation, unprecedented in both religious martyrdom and in the Zionist tradition established in Palestine.\\" Annual pilgrimages to her tomb in Zikhron's cemetery started in 1935. After the Six Day War of 1967 the memory of Aaronsohn and of Nili became a part of Israel's cult of heroism, officially recognized by the Labor Party and celebrated in children's literature.

NILI is an acronym which stands for the Hebrew phrase \\"Netzah Yisrael Lo Yeshaker\\", which translates as \\"the Eternal One of Israel will not lie\\". The British government code-named NILI the \\"A Organization\\", according to a 1920 misfiled memorandum in the British National Archives, as described in the book Spies in Palestine by James Srodes. The choice of siding with the British against the ruling power, the Ottomans, was eventually proven right by history, but in taking it the members of Nili went against the majority view of their fellow Jews from the Yishuv, who feared fierce persecution. These fears almost materialised when the spy ring was discovered, and the Jews of Palestine escaped the tragic fate of the Armenians only due to the intervention of the Vatican, the German government and General Erich von Falkenhayn, commander of the Ottoman-German troops in Palestine. Name Nili () is an acronym of a phrase from the First Book of Samuel (, Hebrew: ◊†◊¶◊ó ◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú ◊ú◊ê ◊ô◊©◊ß◊®, transliteration: Netzakh Yisrael Lo Yeshaker, translation: \\"The Eternity (God) of Israel will not lie\\"). History=Establishment= Yosef Lishansky of the Nili spy ring Sarah Aaronsohn, her brothers Aaron and Alex, and their sister Rivka, together with their friend (and Rivka's fianc√©) Avshalom Feinberg formed and led Nili. In 1915, even before the group commenced operations, the Turks imprisoned Feinberg on suspicion of spying, which was not true at the time. When Feinberg was arrested for espionage and held in Beersheba, Yosef Lishansky joined Nili in December 1915. Because he was active in the south, he was recruited by Feinberg to pass information to and from Sarah Aaronsohn, who was operating from Atlit. From March to October 1915, a plague of locusts stripped areas in and around Palestine of almost all vegetation. The Turkish authorities, worried about feeding their troops, turned to world-famous botanist and the region's leading agronomist, Aaron Aaronsohn, who requested the release of his friend and assistant, Avshalom Feinberg. The team fighting the locust invasion was given permission to move around the country, enabling them to collect strategic information about Ottoman camps and troop deployment. For months, the group was not taken seriously by British intelligence, and attempts by Aaron Aaronsohn and Avshalom Feinberg to establish communication channels in Cairo and Port Said failed. Only after Aaronsohn arrived in London (by way of Berlin and Copenhagen) and owing to his reputation, was he able to obtain cooperation from the diplomat Sir Mark Sykes. Sarah oversaw operations in Palestine from Zikhron Ya'akov. =Demise= Attempting to reach Egypt on foot, Avshalom Feinberg was killed and Yosef Lishansky was wounded but managed to reach British lines. From February to September 1917, the steam yacht Managem regularly sailed to the Palestinian coast near Atlit. Lishansky swam ashore to collect Nili information and to pass money sent by American Jews to the starving yishuv. However, the presence of German submarines made the trips too risky and the group switched to homing pigeons. In the fall of 1917, one of these pigeons was caught by the Turks, who were able to decipher the Nili code (based on Hebrew, Aramaic, French, and English) within one week. As a result, the Turks were able to unravel the spy network, whereupon the leadership of the Yishuv and the Hashomer disassociated itself from Nili. One Nili member, Na'aman Belkind, was captured by the Turks and reportedly revealed information about the group. In October 1917, the Turks surrounded Zichron Yaakov and arrested numerous people, including Sarah, who committed suicide after four days of torture. Other prisoners were incarcerated in Damascus. Lishansky and Belkind were hanged. Controversies Nili's \\"irresponsibility\\" for not coordinating their operations with the Zionist leadership, thereby endangering the Yishuv, was the cause of a longstanding controversy among the Jewish community of the British Mandate of Palestine and subsequently of the State of Israel. The issue was officially resolved in November 1967, when Feinberg's remains were reinterred on Mount Herzl with full military honors, with eulogies delivered by both Speaker of the Knesset and chief chaplain of the IDF. Remembrance The Aaronsohn home in Zikhron Ya'akov, Beit Aaronsohn, has been preserved as a museum and memorial to Nili. West of Zichron Yaakov is a moshav called Givat Nili. Many streets throughout Israel bear the Nili name. In December 2015 the Israel Post marked the centenary of Nili with a special stamp issue.

They are small trailing (rather than upright or high-arching) brambles with aggregate fruits, reminiscent of the raspberry, but are usually purple to black instead of red. Dewberries are common throughout most of the Northern Hemisphere and are thought of as a beneficial weed. The leaves can be used to make a herbal tea, and the berries are edible and taste sweet. They can be eaten raw, or used to make cobbler, jam, or pie. Alternatively, they are sometimes referred to as ground berries. Around March and April, the plants start to grow white flowers that develop into small green berries. The tiny green berries grow red and then a deep purple-blue as they ripen. When the berries are ripe, they are tender and difficult to pick in any quantity without squashing them. The plants do not have upright canes like some other Rubus species, but have stems that trail along the ground, putting forth new roots along the length of the stem. The stems are covered with fine spines or stickers. The berries are sweet and, for many, less seedy than blackberries. In the winter the leaves often remain on the stems, but may turn dark red. The leaves are sometimes eaten by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including peach blossom moths. The European dewberry, Rubus caesius, grows more upright like other brambles, but is frequently restricted to coastal communities, especially sand dune systems. Its fruits are a deep, almost black, purple and are coated with a thin layer or 'dew' of waxy droplets. Thus, they appear sky- blue (caesius is Latin for pale blue). It is less sought after, because its fruits are small and retain a markedly tart taste even when fully ripe. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the town of Cameron, North Carolina, was known as the \\"dewberry capital of the world\\" for large scale cultivation of this berry which was shipped out for wide spread consumption. Local growers made extensive use of the railroads, in the area, to ship them nationally and internationally.

Gary Gray (in his directorial debut) and written by Ice Cube and DJ Pooh. It follows Craig Jones (Ice Cube) and Smokey (Chris Tucker), unemployed best friends who must pay a local drug dealer on a Friday night. The film is the first installment in the Friday franchise and co-stars Nia Long, Tiny \\"Zeus\\" Lister Jr., Regina King, Anna Maria Horsford, Bernie Mac, and John Witherspoon. While developing the film, Ice Cube and DJ Pooh expressed discontent regarding the portrayal of the hood in film, which they came to see as too violent and menacing. As a result, they wished to emphasize the positive aspects of life in the hood, and drew on a number of personal experiences when crafting the characters and plot points. Preparations for the film began after the pair were able to secure funding from New Line Cinema, who granted finance in exchange for a seasoned comedian in one of the lead roles. During casting, Ice Cube and DJ Pooh quickly settled on Tucker. Friday was theatrically released in the United States on April 26, 1995. It received positive reviews from critics, many of whom praised the comedic sequences, writing, and acting performances. The film was also a commercial success, grossing $28.2 million worldwide. It has subsequently obtained a large cult following, inspiring an Internet meme and several pop- cultural references. The film launched a media franchise that includes the sequels Next Friday (2000) and Friday After Next (2002). The sequels have also gained a cult following status despite their negative reviews. Plot On Friday in South Central Los Angeles, Craig Jones is newly unemployed after being accused of stealing boxes. He hangs out on his front porch with his best friend, Smokey, a snappy, mischievous drug dealer who sells weed for Big Worm, the psychopathic neighborhood supplier. Throughout the day, Craig and Smokey observe the goings-on in their neighborhood, including Debbie, whom Craig is interested in. Smokey, who has been smoking rather than selling his consignment of marijuana, has a confrontation with Big Worm. In an attempt to explain his money shortage, Smokey incriminates Craig. Big Worm threatens to kill Craig and Smokey if they do not give him $200 by 10:00 pm. Craig angrily confronts Smokey about his lack of initiative in selling the marijuana before deciding to help Smokey. Craig unsuccessfully attempts to borrow money from his mother Betty, his sister Dana (who eventually tells their father about the situation), and his jealous girlfriend, Joi, who is seen cheating on him earlier in the film. Craig's father, Willie, eventually learns of Craig's plan, as well as the fact that Craig is carrying a gun. Willie tells Craig that he should use his fists, instead of guns, to resolve his problems, while telling Craig the story of how Willie's brother lost his life due to gun violence. Smokey heads to Debbie's house and notices Red's bike, which Deebo had stolen, on the lawn. He sneaks in and finds Deebo asleep with Felisha. Smokey tries to retrieve the money that he and Deebo stole from Stanley's house earlier, but is interrupted by Ezal. Both escape without the money before Deebo wakes up. Smokey enlists Craig's help to go back and try again, but at that moment, Deebo rides Red's bike past them. The two notice a black car driving slowly and they hide, suspecting a possible drive-by shooting. Scared, they run to Craig's room. Then, after Willie confronts them about the situation with Big Worm, and with 10:00 approaching, Craig and Smokey decide to step out. Once outside, they notice a van parked in the middle of the street with its headlights off. The two flee as Big Worm's men start shooting at them. Meanwhile, the neighbors come out of their houses after hearing the gunshots. Debbie then confronts Deebo for assaulting Felisha, after Deebo falsely accuses Felisha of Smokey's attempted theft. Deebo eventually assaults Debbie, as Craig and Smokey arrive. Angered that Deebo has assaulted Debbie, Craig stands up to him, and threatens him with his gun. Deebo scoffs at the threat and Willie encourages Craig to put the gun down and fight with his hands. Shortly after, Craig and Deebo fight. After nearly losing, Craig wins by using various objects as weapons (such as a brick and a trash can). As Debbie tends to Craig, Smokey steals back the money he was robbed of earlier from a knocked-out Deebo and flees the scene. Red punches Deebo to make sure he doesn't wake up, and retrieves his stolen chain and bicycle, while Ezal steals Deebo's shoes. Craig and Debbie agree to meet up the following day and Craig breaks up with Joi on the phone. Later that night, Smokey settles with Big Worm, and ends the feud. He announces that he is giving up drug dealing and going to rehabilitation. After hanging up, Smokey looks up, lights a joint, and closes the movie by breaking the fourth wall and telling the audience, \\"I was just bullshittin'! And you know this, man!\\" Cast * Ice Cube as Craig Jones * Chris Tucker as Smokey * Nia Long as Debbie * Tiny Lister Jr. as Deebo * John Witherspoon as Willie Jones * Anna Maria Horsford as Betty Jones * Regina King as Dana Jones * Paula Jai Parker as Joi * Bernie Mac as Pastor Clever * Faizon Love as Big Worm * DJ Pooh as Red * Anthony Johnson as Ezal * Tony Cox as Mr. Parker Kathleen Bradley as Mrs. Parker * Angela Means as Felisha The film also contains cameo appearances from F. Gary Gray and LaWanda Page as well as an uncredited Michael Clarke Duncan in his film debut as a craps player. Actress Meagan Good also makes her feature film debut as one of the neighborhood kids on a bike who was a potential customer standing in line at Big Worm's ice cream truck. Production Prior to Fridays release, movies such as Boyz n the Hood (also starring Ice Cube) and Colors portrayed life in the hood as violent and menacing. Ice Cube felt that these films did not portray the full picture of living in the hood, missing a more lighthearted element, with Cube later saying, \\"we had fun in the hood. We used to trip off the neighborhood.\\" Therefore, Cube and DJ Pooh decided to create a film that would portray that environment. The script was only the third Cube had ever written; the previous two were undeveloped. With the film, Ice Cube intended to make a \\"hood classic\\", one that could be \\"[watched] over and over and over again\\". According to Ice Cube, a majority of the film is autobiographical, with much of it being based on events that occurred in his neighborhood growing up. Smokey was based on DJ Pooh's stint as a drug dealer, while Craig being fired on his day off was based on Ice Cube's cousin, who was working as a driver for United Parcel Service at the time. Prior to writing, the duo realized their inexperience as filmmakers was unlikely to attract major film studios, and floated the idea of self-financing the film themselves. For a time, the idea of making the film in black and white to save money was considered, before the pair decided on approaching New Line Cinema about producing the film, who had achieved success with the House Party series; a film-type the duo aimed to replicate. New Line Cinema agreed to finance the production, but requested that the role of Smokey, initially to be played by Pooh, be played by someone with more experience. Cube and Pooh immediately decided on Tucker, after discovering the comic through Def Comedy Jam. However, Tucker's first audition was disastrous, but was granted more time to try again at a later date. Tucker soon contacted Angela Means, aiming to work with her acting coach, but was instead invited to a workshop session over dinner, in order to help him secure the role. According to Means, \\"by the time that spaghetti was gone, Chris was Smokey.\\" Cube was granted license to select the film's director, and decided on Gray, who was a music video director. Gray had previously worked with Cube on a number of occasions, and was also aiming to establish a foothold in Hollywood, initially through a short film. Cube instead offered him the role for Friday, as he was attracted to the fact that he and Gray grew up with similar backgrounds, feeling the director would accurately capture the film's aesthetic, and would not have to be coached on any aspect of the film. Gray said that Ice Cube starring in a comedy \\"scared the shit out of me,\\" as he doubted whether audiences would buy into Cube portraying a role so different from his public persona. Gray explained, \\"Ice Cube was the nigga you loved to hate. He was like the toughest man in America, and when you take someone you‚Äôre used to delivering on hard- hitting social issues in hardcore gangsta rap, and who has a hardcore point of view on politics, you would never think comedy.\\" Release Friday was released on April 26, 1995 in the United States, June 30, 1995 in the United Kingdom, and October 5, 1995 in Australia. The film saw a limited, theatrical re-release in honor of its 20th anniversary on April 20, 2015 for one night only. =Home media= The film was released on DVD on March 2, 1999 and Blu- ray on September 8, 2009, with a new director's cut (97 minutes). The single disc DVD contains a theatrical trailer, a featurette on the film, and cast and crew interviews. Reception Friday received mostly positive reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 78% approval rating, based on 27 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"What Friday might lack in taut construction or directorial flair, it more than makes up with its vibrant (albeit consistently crass) humor and the charming, energetic performances of its leads.\\" Metacritic gives the film a score of 54 out of 100, based on 9 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Director Quentin Tarantino counted Friday as one of his 20 favorite movies from 1992 to 2009. The film has obtained a large cult following since its release. A scene in the film is the source of the internet meme Bye, Felicia‚Äîwhich is a phrase meant to dismiss an inconsequential person. Former Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker James Harrison and San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Deebo Samuel are both nicknamed Deebo in reference to the character from the film. Friday grossed $6,589,341 on its opening weekend debuting at #2 in the box office in 865 theaters, averaging $7,617 per theater. The film grossed $27,467,564 in North America and $748,354 internationally, with a total of $28,215,918 worldwide. Sequels The film's success spawned two sequels: Next Friday (2000) and Friday After Next (2002). A fourth installment, tentatively titled Last Friday, has been in the works for several years. The film also inspired an animated series, titled Friday: The Animated Series, which aired in 2007.

A box camera is a simple type of camera, the most common form being a cardboard or plastic box with a lens in one end and film at the other. They were sold in large numbers during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The lenses are often single element designs meniscus fixed focus lens, or in better quality box cameras a doublet lens with minimal (if any) possible adjustments to the aperture or shutter speeds. Because of the inability to adjust focus, the small lens aperture and the low sensitivity of the sensitive materials available, these cameras work best in brightly lit day-lit scenes when the subject is within the hyperfocal distance for the lens and of subjects that move little during the exposure. Eventually, box cameras with photographic flash, shutter and aperture adjustment were introduced, allowing indoor photos.  Purpose  The KODAK camera introduced in 1888 was the first box camera to become widely adopted by the public and its design became the archetype for box camera designs introduced by many different manufacturers. The use of flexible roll film meant that the cameras were light and portable and could be used without the encumbrance of tripods and the attendant difficulty of using glass photographic plates which were typical of professional cameras. Before the introduction of the Kodak, photographers were responsible for making their own arrangements for the development and printing of their pictures. The first Kodak came pre-loaded with film and the customer returned the camera to Kodak for processing and to be reloaded with film for the customer. In 1900, a Yale plate box camera cost US$2 (about $ in dollars). and a Kodak rollfilm box sold for US$1 (about $ in dollars)  Typical box cameras  *The Kodak introduced in May 1888 first commercially successful box camera for roll film‚Äîthe advertising slogan being You press the button ‚Äì we do the rest. *The Kodak Brownie, a long lasting series of classical box cameras using roll film. *The Ansco Panda was designed to compete directly with the Brownies. It used 620 film. *The Kodak Instamatic using 126 film, later 110 film. *The modern disposable camera using 135 film. *The Zeiss Ikon Box-Tengor for roll film.  Other box cameras  Although many cameras of the mid nineteenth century were wooden and \\"boxy\\" in appearance with a brass fitted lens on the front they should not be confused with the mass-produced box cameras that exploded in popularity after the introduction of the first Kodak. Le Phoebus 1870 The \\"Le Phoebus\\" camera was typical, it was built of mahogany wood with a brass mounted lens in a rack-and-pinion focuser to adjust the projected image sharply onto a ground glass at the back. Most cameras like this used glass plates. The lens did not come equipped with a shutter; instead, the lenscap was removed and replaced to control the exposure time. Pocket Kodak 1895‚Äì1896 Pocket Kodaks were small (2 and 3/16 x 3 x 4 inches) and lightweight (6 ounces), and took roughly 2 inch exposures on 102 size rollfilm. This camera had a new feature, a small view box that told how many exposures of film were left. They were first available in 1895 with either black or red leather covering. Crown Camera 1896 Patent GB189602965 was granted on February 10, 1896 to Thomas Peter Bethell of Crown Works, Boundary Place, Liverpool for a simple construction of camera to be made of cardboard of metal, or a combination of both. The Crown Camera had a quarter-plate cardboard-body with two waist level finders, cardboard rubber-band powered shutter, four-position rotary stops marked 1 2 3 4, a single meniscus lens, removable ground glass screen, rear sliding sheath and leather carrying strap. le Papillon 1905‚Äì1908 Meaning \\"the butterfly,\\" le Papillon was a small French stereo camera which made 45mm x 107mm stereoscopic images on glass plates in single plateholders. No. 00 Cartridge Premo Camera, 1916‚Äì1922 The No. 00 Cartridge Premo was Kodak's smallest box camera ever. It was only 2¬Ω inches tall. It uses a simple rotary shutter with meniscus lens, and does not have a viewfinder. The photographer must use the leatherette covering to attempt to see the subject of the photograph.

The type species of its genus, it is native to blackwater and clearwater streams in the Amazon basin of South America. Its bright colouring makes the fish visible to conspecifics in the dark blackwater streams, and is also the main reason for its popularity among freshwater fish hobbyists. Range and habitat The neon tetra is found in the western and northern Amazon basin in southeastern Colombia, eastern Peru, and western Brazil. It lives in waters with a temperature between and pH 4‚Äì7.5. It has a preference for acidic blackwater streams, but also occurs in transparent clearwater streams. It is not found in the whitewater rivers. Description The neon tetra has a light-blue back over a silver-white abdomen. The fish is characterized by an iridescent blue horizontal stripe along each side of the fish from its nose to the base of the adipose fin, and an iridescent red stripe that begins at the middle of the body and extends posteriorly to the base of the caudal fin. The fish is partially transparent (including fins) except for these markings. Sexual dimorphism is slight, with the female having a slightly larger belly, and a bent iridescent stripe rather than the male's straight stripe. During the night, the blue and red become gray or black as the fish rests. It reactivates once it becomes active in the morning. It grows to approximately 4 cm (1.5 in) in overall length. They have recently become available in a long-fin variety. Economics The neon tetra was first imported from South America and was described by renowned ichthyologist Dr. George S. Myers in 1936, and named after Dr. William T. Innes. {{Cite web url= P. innesi is one of the most popular aquarium fish with about 2 million sold in the US each month. Most neon tetras available in the United States are imported from Southeast Asia, where they are farm- raised, or to a lesser extent from Colombia, Peru, and Brazil, where they are collected from the wild. During a single month, an average of 1.8 million neon tetras with an estimated value of $175,000 are imported into the United States for the aquarium trade. With the exception of home aquarists and a few commercial farms that breed neon tetras experimentally, captive breeding on a commercial scale is nonexistent in the USA. In the aquarium A shoal of neon tetras in a home aquarium In the wild they inhabit very soft, acidic waters (pH 4.0 to 4.8) Ideal pH for aquarium is 7.0, but a range of 6.0 to 8.0 is tolerable. They can have a lifespan of as long as ten years, or normally two to three years in aquarium. Neon tetras are considered easy to keep in a aquarium of at least 10 gallons. Their ideal parameters are the following Temperature: 72¬∞-76¬∞F (22¬∞-24¬∞C) Nitrate: <20 ppm pH: 6.0 to 7.0 GH: <10 dGH KH: 1-2 dKH They are shoaling fish and must be kept in groups of at least 6 but will be more active in groups of 8-12 or more. Neon tetras are best kept in a densely planted tank to resemble their native Amazon environments. =Nutrition= Neon tetras are omnivores and will accept most flake foods, if sufficiently small, but should also have some small foods such as brine shrimp, daphnia, freeze-dried bloodworms, tubifex, which can be stuck to the side of the aquarium, and micropellet food to supplement their diets. A tropical sinking pellet is ideal, as most brands of these include natural color enhancers that bring out the color in neon tetras. Some frozen foods, including frozen blood worms, add variety to their diets. = Breeding= Neon tetra The male is slender, and the blue line is straighter. The female is rounder, producing a bent blue line. Some aquarists say the females look plumper when viewed from above. However, the straightness of the line and the plumpness of the female might occasionally be due to the eggs she is carrying. A neon tetra can appear slightly plump in the belly due to having overeaten.Feeding and diseases: http://neontetras.info/Neon_Tetra_Feeding_and_Diseases.html Neon tetras need dim lighting, a DH less than one, about 5.5 pH, and a temperature of 75¬∞F to breed. There also needs to be a lot of tannins in the water. Neon tetras are old enough to breed at 12 weeks. Breeding neon tetras is considered to be difficult in home aquariums. However, it is becoming more common, with less than 5% of specimens currently sold in America caught in the wild, and more than 1.5 million specimens imported to America each month from fish farms. = Disease = Neon tetras are occasionally afflicted by the so-called \\"neon tetra disease\\" (NTD) or pleistophora disease, a sporozoan disease caused by Pleistophora hyphessobryconis. Despite being a well-known condition, it is generally incurable and often fatal to the fish. However this disease is also generally preventable. The disease cycle begins when microsporidian parasite spores enter the fish after it consumes infected material, such as the bodies of a dead fish, or live food such as tubifex, which may serve as intermediate hosts. The disease is most likely passed by newly acquired fish that have not been quarantined. Symptoms include restlessness, loss of coloration, lumps on the body as cysts develop, difficulty swimming, curved spines as the disease progresses, and secondary infections, such as fin rot and bloating. A so- called \\"false neon disease\\", which is bacterial, shows very similar symptoms. It is impossible for the home aquarist to determine for certain the difference between NTD and false NTD on the basis of visible symptoms alone, without laboratory backup. This disease has also been confused with columnaris (mouth rot, mouth fungus, 'flex'). Generally the best 'treatment' is the immediate removal of diseased fish to preserve the remaining fish, although some occasional successful treatments have been performed that include fish baths and a \\"medication cocktail\\". The use of a diatom filter, which can reduce the number of free parasites in the water, may help. As with Pleistophora neon tetra disease, prevention is most important and this disease is rare when good preventative measures are performed.  Related species  The green neon tetra (P. simulans) and black neon tetra (Hyphessobrycon herbertaxelrodi) are distinct species‚Äîthe latter belongs to a different genus‚Äîand not color varieties. The cardinal tetra (P. axelrodi) is also a similar species, but its greater extent of red coloring distinguishes it from the neon tetra. The name Hyphessobrycon innesi is an obsolete synonym for P. innesi.

The family includes about 34 species. As labyrinth fishes, they possess a labyrinth organ, a structure in the fish's head which allows it to breathe atmospheric oxygen. Fish of this family are commonly seen gulping at air at the surface of the water. The air is held in a structure called the suprabranchial chamber, where oxygen diffuses into the bloodstream via the respiratory epithelium covering the labyrinth organ. This therefore allows the fish to move small distances across land. Climbing perch (Anabas testudineus) on land Genera There are four extant genera within the family Anabantidae: * Anabas Cloquet, 1816 * Ctenopoma Peters, 1844 * Microctenopoma Norris, 1995 * Sandelia (Castelnau, 1861) There is also at least one extinct genus known: * ‚Ä†Eoanabas Wu, Chang, Miao et al, 2016 Of the four genera, Anabas is found from South Asia (they are called (Tamil: ‡Æ™‡Æ©‡Øà‡ÆØ‡Øá‡Æ±‡Æø ‡Æï‡ØÜ‡Æ£‡Øç‡Æü‡Øà (Panaieri Kendai) chemballi (Malayalam: ) in Kerala, kau (odia) in Odisha, India, kawaiya in Sri Lanka, Bangla: ‡¶ï‡¶á ‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶õ (koi mach), east to China and Southeast Asia. The remaining three genera are all restricted to Africa. They are primarily freshwater fishes and only very rarely are found in brackish water. Parental care is varied; Anabas and Ctenopoma simply abandon their eggs, Microctenopoma species produce bubblenests like their relatives in the Osphronemidae, and Sandelia lays their eggs on the substrate. Climbing gouramis are so named due to their ability to \\"climb\\" out of water and \\"walk\\" short distances. Even though it has not been reliably observed, some authors have mentioned about them having a tree climbing ability. Their method of terrestrial locomotion uses the gill plates as supports, and the fish pushes itself using its fins and tail.

Up to some decades ago the genera now included in family Smilacaceae were often assigned to a more broadly defined family Liliaceae, but for the past twenty to thirty years most botanists have accepted Smilacaceae as a distinct family. It is considered that the two families diverged around 55 million years ago during the Early Paleogene possibly near the boundary between Paleocene and Eocene. One characteristic that distinguishes Smilacaceae from most of the other members of the Liliaceae-like Liliales is that it has true vessels in its conducting tissue. Another is that the veins of the leaves, between major veins, are reticulate (net-shaped), rather than parallel as in most monocots.  Taxonomy  The APG II system, of 2003 (unchanged from the APG system, of 1998), recognizes this family and places it in the order Liliales, in the clade monocots. Earlier it was a family of two genera, Heterosmilax and Smilax, but DNA studies have shown that Heterosmilax has arisen from Smilax and the two genera are now merged. This results in Smilax being the only genus in Smilacaceae with about 210 known species. The family occurs throughout the tropical and warm temperate regions of the world. Members of this family typically have woody roots and a climbing or vining form. Some have woody vining stems, often with thorns, while others are herbaceous above ground and thornless. Other placements of the family include: * The Cronquist system, of 1981, recognized this family and placed it in order Liliales, in subclass Liliidae in class Liliopsida [=monocotyledons] of division Magnoliophyta [=angiosperms]. * The Reveal system recognized this family and placed it in order Smilacales, in subclass Liliidae which is placed as in the Cronquist system. * The Thorne system (1992) also recognized this family, and placed it in order Dioscoreales in superorder Lilianae in subclass Liliidae [=monocotyledons] of class Magnoliopsida [=angiosperms]. * The Dahlgren system treated it as did the Thorne system (1992): see above.  Characteristics  Members of this family can be herbaceous to \\"woody\\" vines. They grow from this rhizomes and are often armed with prickles on the stems and/or leaves. Leaves are alternate and simple; and entire to spinose-serrate. Some members of this family have coriaceous (leathery) leaves. Venation of the leaves may be palmate to reticulate. A pair of tendrils often appear near the base of the petiole. The inflorescence type for members of this family is an umbel. The flowers are inconspicuous, radial and unisexual. The flowers are made of 6 tepals, 6 stamens and 3 carpels. The fruit type of all members of Smilacaceae is a berry. The number of seeds per berry is 1‚Äì3. Nectaries are located at the base of the tepals.  Genera  While both genera are dioecious and nearly indistinguishable vegetatively, their flowers differ markedly. The flower of Heterosmilax is fused into a deep bottle-shaped tube containing prominent nectaries and its stamens are connected at the bottom, whereas flowers of Smilax are typically small with unfused floral parts. Smilax is a much larger and more widely distributed genus than Heterosmilax. Heterosmilax has only twelve species which are confined to China, Japan, tropical Asia, Singapore, Malaysia, and the surrounding islands. Some taxonomists separate the herbaceous plants native to North America in Smilax as the genus Nemexia, which is known for its malodorous flowers. Smilax would then be left with only plants of a woody, vining form with thorns. However the Flora of North America does not recognise Nemexia, nor does the AP-site.

They will also grow over trees and other plants up to 10 m high, their hooked thorns allowing them to hang onto and scramble over branches. The genus includes both deciduous and evergreen species. The leaves are heart shaped and vary from 4‚Äì30 cm long in different species. Greenbrier is dioecious. However, only about one in three colonies have plants of both sexes. Plants flower in May and June with white/green clustered flowers. If pollination occurs, the plant will produce a bright red to blue-black spherical berry fruit about 5‚Äì10 mm in diameter that matures in the fall.  Taxonomy  The genus has traditionally been considered as divided into a number of sections, but molecular phylogenetic studies reveals that these morphologically defined subdivisions are not monophyletic. Subdivision is best considered in terms of clades (A‚ÄìD), corresponding to biogeography, with the main divisions being Old World (clades C, D) and New World (clade B) with the exception of S. aspera, that appears to be sister to all other species (clade A) and has a tri-continental disjunction. Section Smilax includes \\"woody\\", prickly vines of temperate North America, for example cat greenbrier (S. glauca) and common greenbrier (S. rotundifolia).FNAEC (2002) Section Nemexia includes unarmed herbaceous plants of temperate North America, for example \\"carrion flowers\\" like the smooth herbaceous greenbrier (S. herbacea). Section Heterosmilax represents a previous separate genus that was found to be embedded within Smilax, and was reduced to a section within it. = List of selected species = * Smilax aberrans Gagnep. * Smilax aculeatissima Conran * Smilax amblyobasis K.Krause * Smilax ampla Warb. ex K.Krause * Smilax anceps Willd. * Smilax anguina K.Krause * Smilax annulata Warb. ex K.Krause * Smilax aquifolium Ferrufino & Greuter * Smilax arisanensis Hayata * Smilax aristolochiifolia Mill. - American sarsaparilla * Smilax aspera L. - Mediterranean smilax, common smilax, rough smilax * Smilax aspericaulisWall. ex A.DC. * Smilax assumptionis A.DC. * Smilax astrosperma F.T.Wang & Tang * Smilax auriculata Walter * Smilax australis R.Br. - lawyer vine, barbwire vine, wait-a-while (Australia) * Smilax azorica H.Schaef. & P.Sch√∂nfelder * Smilax bapouensis H.Li * Smilax basilata F.T.Wang & Tang * Smilax bauhinioides Kunth * Smilax bella J.F.Macbr. * Smilax biflora Siebold ex Miq. * Smilax biltmoreana (Small) J.B.Norton ex Pennell * Smilax biumbellata T.Koyama * Smilax blumei A.DC. * Smilax bockii Warb. * Smilax bona-nox L. - saw greenbrier * Smilax borneensis A.DC. * Smilax bracteata Presl * Smilax brasiliensis Sprengel. * Smilax californica (A.DC.)

Distribution and habitat  Pantropical, extending into adjacent temperate zones to north and south. 29 species are recognized in Central America and the Caribbean.  Ecology  The berry is rubbery in texture and has a large, spherical seed in the center. The fruit stays intact through winter, when birds and other animals eat them to survive. The seeds are passed unharmed in the animal's droppings. Since many Smilax colonies are single clones that have spread by rhizomes, both sexes may not be present at a site, in which case no fruit is formed. Smilax is a very damage-tolerant plant capable of growing back from its rhizomes after being cut down or burned down by fire. This, coupled with the fact that birds and other small animals spread the seeds over large areas, makes the plants very hard to get rid of. It grows best in moist woodlands with a soil pH between 5 and 6. The seeds have the greatest chance of germinating after being exposed to a freeze. Blue admiral (Kaniska canace) caterpillar on China smilax (S. china) Besides their berries providing an important food for birds and other animals during the winter, greenbrier plants also provide shelter for many other animals. The thorny thickets can effectively protect small animals from larger predators who cannot enter the prickly tangle. Deer and other herbivorous mammals will eat the foliage, as will some invertebrates such as Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), which also often drink nectar from the flowers. Among the Lepidoptera utilizing Smilax are Hesperiidae like the water snow flat (Tagiades litigiosa), Pieridae like the small grass yellow (Eurema smilax), or moths like the peculiar and sometimes flightless genus Thyrocopa. But particularly fond of greenbriers are certain Nymphalidae caterpillars, for example those of: * Faunis - faun butterflies * Kaniska canace - blue admiral (on China smilax, S. china) * Phalanta phalantha - common leopard (on S. tetragona)  Uses  Diosgenin is found in S. menispermoidea S. aristolochiifolia) from K√∂hler's Medicinal Plants An extract from the roots of some species - most significantly Jamaican sarsaparilla (S. ornata) - is used to make the sarsaparilla drink and other root beers, as well as herbal drinks like the popular Baba Roots from Jamaica. Two species, S. domingensis and S. havanensis, are used in a traditional soda-like Cuban beverage called pru. The roots may also be used in soups or stews. The young shoots can be eaten raw or cooked and are said to taste like asparagus, and the berries can be eaten both raw and cooked. Stuffed smilax pancake, or f√∫l√≠ng jiƒÅb«êng (), is a traditional snack from the Beijing region. S. glabra is used in Chinese herbology. It is also a key ingredient in the Chinese medical dessert guƒ´l√≠nggƒÅo, which makes use of its property to set certain kinds of jelly. The powdered roots of Jamaican sarsaparilla are known as Rad. Sarzae. Jam. in pharmacy and are used as a traditional medicine for gout in Latin American countries. K√∂hler's Medicinal Plants of 1887 discusses the American sarsaparilla (S. aristolochiifolia), but as early as about 1569, in his treatise devoted to syphilis, the Persian scholar Imad al-Din Mahmud ibn Mas‚Äòud Shirazi gave a detailed evaluation of the medical properties of chinaroot.F.

Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2012 Diosgenin, a steroidal sapogenin, is reported from S. menispermoidea. Other active compounds reported from various greenbrier species are parillin (also sarsaparillin or smilacin), sarsapic acid, sarsapogenin and sarsaponin. Due to the nectar-rich flowers, species like S. medica and S. officinalis are also useful honey plants.

Note that in Java, the terms \\"field\\" and \\"variable\\" are used interchangeably for member variable. A class variable is not an instance variable. It is a special type of class attribute (or class property, field, or data member). The same dichotomy between instance and class members applies to methods (\\"member functions\\") as well; a class may have both instance methods and class methods. Static member variables and static member functions In some languages, class variables and class methods are either statically resolved, not via dynamic dispatch, or their memory statically allocated at compile time (once for the entire class, as static variables), not dynamically allocated at run time (at every instantiation of an object). In other cases, however, either or both of these are dynamic. For example, if classes can be dynamically defined (at run time), class variables of these classes are allocated dynamically when the class is defined, and in some languages class methods are also dispatched dynamically. Thus in some languages, static member variable or static member function are used synonymously with or in place of \\"class variable\\" or \\"class function\\", but these are not synonymous across languages. These terms are commonly used in Java, C# , and C++, where class variables and class methods are declared with the \`static\` keyword, and referred to as static member variables or static member functions. Example struct Request { static int count; int number; Request() { number = count; // modifies the instance variable \\"this->number\\" ++count; // modifies the class variable \\"Request::count\\" } }; int Request::count = 0; In this C++ example, the class variable \`Request::count\` is incremented on each call to the constructor, so that \`Request::count\` always holds the number of Requests that have been constructed, and each new Request object is given a \`number\` in sequential order. Since \`count\` is a class variable, there is only one object \`Request::count\`; in contrast, each Request object contains its own distinct \`number\` field. Also note that the variable \`Request::count\` is initialized only once.

Nemexia is a section of plants in the family Smilacaceae. It consists of the herbaceous plants within the genus Smilax. Smilax species fall into two groups with distinctive morphologies: one group has woody perennial stems with thorns and a vining habit, while the other group has herbaceous stems that die back to the ground each winter. S. sect. Nemexia is the taxon that comprises the herbaceous species. In the past it was often a genus of its own under the name Nemexia and taxonomists still need further study of the species of Smilax to determine its proper rank.http://www.bioone.org/perlserv/?request=get- document&issn;=0007-196X&volume;=056&issue;=02&page;=0166Fu, C., H.

However the widely accepted taxonomic system of the Flora of North America does not recognize Nemexia, nor does the AP-site. Thus Nemexia is not currently considered an accepted genus taxon by most plant taxonomists.ISB: Atlas of Florida Vascular Plants The plants in Smilax, are called carrion flowers for their malodorous flowers and those plants included in section Nemexia also have flowers that smell like rotten meat. The herbaceous species have greenish-yellow flowers and bloom in spring, they are fly pollinated. Phylogenetic relationships Cladistic analysis among several members of the section was carried out in 2005 on several gene sequences, including the plastid trnL-F and rpl16 sequences and the nuclear internal transcribed spacer. The eastern North American species in the morphologically variable S. herbacea complex form a sister group to the western North American S. jamesii. The analysis did not conclusively clarify whether the S. herbacea complex should be recognized as different species. The two East Asian species, S. riparia and S. nipponica, formed two well-defined clades. It is hypothesized that the ancestor of this section evolved in Asia and spread to North America via the Bering Strait land bridge. ReferencesExternal links :* Smilacaceae in L. Watson and M.J.
